Nextdoor cancer. site feeds addition people sound important Facebook does. beautiful corner Covid elections - feel horrible. 32 bit integer overflow 2.147 billion uhhhh... he's little off. ""United"" guys?  particular reason? ""nobody gonna tell save life"" bad luck? That's 3% test positivity rate. great, much better US currently 6% test positivity rate. Someone tell Joe Biden. Given recurrence interval ~800,000 years something geologically ""due"" pretty low-risk. Yellowstone going go we'll years, maybe decades warning.

On hand, want tempt 2020..  likely deaths already 300k+ many unconfirmed deaths home. take number total deaths year relative past years. absolutely terrible. sorry ❤️ rest fake news. Man, posts I'm seeing Facebook friends getting ready party Halloween going get really fucking bad. GOP love virus much love open carry. part story suddenly unite deadly virus work together social distance, contact trace, keep hospitals collapsing save lives? handing candy mask gloves virtual party shit friends Man, posts I'm seeing Facebook friends getting ready party Halloween going get really fucking bad. Boutta stop working, get pallet canned beans, start working Steam catalog everyone unstupids dies off.

Finna call Madagascar  Based Negative. false positive. parents didn’t rapid test like us negative week later girl rides every day negative. cost 4 hours work able return negative weeks later new rules work would 14 days unpaid. works nursing home paid 10 days exempt ever getting weekly tested even though know false positive works treats positive. also remove kids teeball. Woooooo! We're number one everyone! [great resource tracking test-positivity anyone curious.

The Midwest’s [per capita also alarming. rural Midwest areas don’t nearly much hospital/ICU capacity urban areas either. It’s weird didn’t bring country together. People getting sick virus dying nothing politics reality somehow wearing damn mask something “dumb Democrats” it’s “violation rights”. Don’t let virus dominate you.  way idea 😭 Rounding corner Trump kidding making us winners. Can't wait see Biden gonna top this. everywhere world  time deaths catch enough people care behavior fucking water cases. one living Midwest, I’m concerned. incredibly right scary. Dunno missed it. friend's father one first dozen people die Washington. Saw Facebook since I'm close days. Things got real fast me, though. Well adults charge country see Biden administration nation wide lock ineptitude Trump made pandemic impossible stop unless everyone gets shit together think happening Well lost money. No. It’s floating air Ah yes, one achievements, [""ending This. sometimes sit cry thinking complete lack humanity many Americans have. get nation? government involved, there's huge number apolitical scientists consulted. 

One weekend enough time gather sort consensus public thinks anyway, Boris going look Twitter replies judge response that. Also polls consistently done actually support harsher measures, already know public opinion is. America even tell people local costco outbreak.

Mild asymptomatic cases spreading silently Thailand 12 new cases today. Fucker praising like first month. ""I know he's Republican I'm really impressed he's handling this!"" Bleh. Mask mandate one day, caved next, completely lost respect instant. No? thought wasn’t problem I’m person matters someone who’s USA know pandemic response shit show. said positivity rate 7% last saw. said countries 15%+...so USA getting trashed much seems compared countries? virus mutate, herd immunity hogwash right, did. F Going back school good idea people said making halloween snack I'm hiding goody bags glow dark stickers backyard. I'm going give kids flashlights go hunting starts getting dark. found idea online. Still gonna dress it. Trying much fun still safe! came be.... aren’t many idiots ct, live state Florida is America's basement. wet, filled mold, strange insects... 100k arbitrary number jesus, terrible weeks anyway

and there's still like 10+ countries Europe per capita equivalent 150k US first time: ""Ok, listen, gonna exponential growth. gotta lockdown thing stop now, gonna bad.""

A significant portion population: ""IT HAPPEN! NOTHING!""

The second time: ""Exponential growth imminent, need again""

A significant portion population:""BUT HAPPEN LAST TIME! I'M AGAIN!""

Tune next month exciting continuation ""The Pandemic""... :( ""it go away say, we're rounding turn, we're rounding corner, going away."" We’re going couple family members houses take seriously do. We’ll also stay outside masked. kind went trick treating. We’re mainly activities home. made daughter huge haunted tunnel, we’re going play games, good, &amp; prizes win.  

But downtown usual trick treating, &amp; looking pics, one social distancing wearing masks. last heard, there’s 40 cases little town. one schools shut down. North Dakota? one midwest states, area center dumpster fire moment. Idahoan here. We're selfish assholes like McGeachin douche canoes. highest case count ever, increasing hospitalizations, deaths starting increase again.

You: ""Very encouraging""

🤦‍♂️ language lesson via Zoom.... Went wed, mask-discipline shop visited was...not good. fled home! assume 15 new domestic asymptomatic cases second round mass testing Xinjiang? grim news indeed  Watch... get US lockdown 2 days. time election. That's sick irony situation. Death rates stable, long term affects may leave lot people dealing long life poor health. need headline every day? kind assume unless something drastic changes. might think sounds smart obviously: ""larger usual"", since unique 2020 never 0 cases, one might well say still first wave.

Nope. wave literally rise fall numbers. numbers rose, fell, rising again. second wave whether want admit it, obviously New Zealand declared victory 4-5 times, local spread, 5th 6th wave. 

Nope. two clear waves community transmission, third possibly hit unless halted again.

I problem admitting New Zealand hit multiple waves. unlike categorically state actions government prevented waves growing control actually turned around.

I never said New Zealand would suffer second wave, third wave even dozens waves. said fast, decisive actions stop waves growing control, thus keep numbers much, much lower. exactly New Zealand done.

Sweden can't say Thats rather useless definition propose. 

Firstly, definition. Secondly, say definition NZ fourth fifth wave. That's fine. explain New Zealand five waves virus spreading community, yet we've less cases entire epidemic Sweden yesterday?

Our five waves nothing compared single day Sweden's second wave. reason government say ""oh well, there's nothing it..."" Sorry, pretty overwhelming. Brain make sense it. Wooooooo!!! I’m FedEx driver understand 100% That’s cuz we’re testing drivers Mexico even peak anymore done 1 / 20th tests US done. I'm largely familiar private healthcare doubt public option Almost entire population would get covid achieve herd immunity would cost many lives worth Lucky you, mean problem thought caught via transmition coughs such.. floating around air now? Cool, sure let 210,000 dead 100,000 intensive care said it’s big deal. We’ve seven months lives wiped virus Birx lifeling evangelical assisted trumps runs PEPFAR, George W. Bush's global AIDS initiative, Redfield involved Children's AIDS Fund International, **which lobbies abstinence-only sex education around nine current CDC employees, several senior agency leaders, 20 former agency leaders public health experts—as well review 100 official emails, memos, documents—**suggest Birx’s hospital data takeover fits pattern opposed CDC guidance, sometimes promoting President Donald Trump’s policies views scientific consensus**.

[The inside story Trump’s COVID-19 coordinator undermined world’s top health agency] much think trump idiot. think need see exact sentence every single fucking thread I’m hoping weather gets really cold Midwest/east coast it’ll help slow spread. Right it’s cold, there’s snow it’s freezing lot places it’s bad go see people travel around. 

Maybe people actually start staying home hits 10-20 degrees consistently many states. Idk. misogyny blaming birx absolving fauci, even recently still backing administration i'm 21, shit senior year college really

you're gonna start feeling place till years clear 30 believe Ok russian troll Lol Biden gets credit virus disappears. going back lockdown? That’s bit stretch. Okay, and?

They overall better practiced hygiene, average Taiwan citizen healthier US, healthcare system isnt shit tactic ours.

But sure, let’s praise Jesus mask. ok? knew always wanted one fucking tiger  It’ll gone Easter guys don’t worry! I'm Belgian. 
A quick side note belgian infection numbers... official statistics intitute sciensano extrapolating report numbers give estimate actual numbers infections. 

[src testing capacity reached, take total positive tests, hocus pocus report bigger number supposedly represents total number infections populace.

That said though, situation bad. El Paso literally started airlifting people nearby hospitals due surge days click cities several seeing explosive growth hospitalizations. city linked, Bryan/College Station Texas A&amp;M University is, run ICU beds.

Also please use term ""fear mongering"". meaningless thought-terminating cliche.   even need lockdown. people would wear masks, social distance, pack crowded bars clubs hours hours every weekend, we'd much better. also talk has""exposed"" lack liveable wages many Americans mistreat many services sectors? Nothing Trump? 

Sounds reet. voted beginning October! course one court house wearing mask. Absolutely blows mind seeing people walking around indoors without masks. believe evolution explains exist god made man dirt woman mans rib? hope don’t stay stuck people, yes people explained world many centuries ago instead least investigating explain things modern era. beyond obvious Bible written people made up. fade obscurity curiosity due time. I’m amazed long run far really. David Attenborough explains absurdity beliefs like better ever will. “I don’t know [why we're here]. People sometimes say me, ‘Why don’t admit humming bird, butterfly, Bird Paradise proof wonderful things produced Creation?’ always say, well, say that, you’ve also got think little boy sitting river bank, like here, West Africa, that’s got little worm, living organism, eye boring eyeball slowly turning blind. Creator God believe in, presumably, also made little worm. personally find difficult accommodate…” aim 250k per day December, then.

Don't let dreams dreams! Bleach helping ? tried mom. lasted long. one could lift her. trying move due dementia, would try get odd times fall. also issues swallowing bodily functions get into. sleep night sometimes screamed. one wants anything get disassociated disillusioned actually believe everything Fanta Menace says. Wasted nuke, sure. powerful may be, we're nothing compared geologic processes. Indeed!  Oops. Never again! 101k, yep. let u/PirateNinja know, think admin running America stupid. Also tell I've mentioned name; get angsty.  boubonic plague would beg differ! 

But modern era, yeah. really right even use term outside context vaccine, 'natural' herd immunity really isn't. People still catching disease, probably many people catch overall, affect many people once. Chicken pox example; everyone got it. herd immunity, fact people immune thus spread rate number susceptible people given time pretty low. everyone still caught it. could 98% herd immunity, new 2% population would catch every year, long new people born immune yet. Biden wins still can't overrule state governor's this. never hold court, especially 6-3 SCOTUS. best provide funding science based reasoning get people voluntarily wear masks covid preventing measures. People overestimate power Federal government.  think hope december early that. using worldometer numbers, end december 60 days now, even 2000 dead day still get 450,000 so. think us getting 400,000 jan 1 good. don’t see us getting 500,000 til least feb unless counting excess deaths.

I hope least. mean, Chief Executive spray tan wears makeup consistently he’s public, who’s judge little makeup then? 
stfu mean, look perspective that, soon enough, might literally nobody left US covid infect... It’s technically turning corner, it’s vertical corner fallen cliff. Hah- Anthem/North Valley... i’m turning lights off. Also, first year haven’t bought candy. Sorry hear that. That’s terrible. American news really can't go day without talking either China T\*ump, right? Literally what's propping ffs shows fucking stupid country is. cult wants chaos. Wants death. Wants racism continue 

It's sick disgusting. see Trump flag house think truly dumb said person is. Australia seemed work them

Don't worry, drag Feds kicking screaming *something*. States take initiative quickly cobble together *something* people got mad anyway. current positivity rates likely 5x+ cases reported right states. familiars situations asked sign doc Covid even not, health care ***gets money patients***. 

Same untrue rumors spreading US, here's doctor said response false claim getting paid diagnosing ER physician want know: pick check? Where’s money that’s I’m supposed get diagnosing everyone Covid? next unending supply PPE every hospital now. supplies aren’t locked aren’t reusing masks day day maybe it’s place Regeneron Remdesivir is. know, medicine we’re using save normal regular folks still go work everyday can’t work home. back office rural hospitals, maybe it’s tents setting take overflow. that’s everyone’s dream right? die fucking tent richest country world. Maybe baby faced 18 year old National Guard member, never signed shit isn’t getting psychological counseling it’s over, maybe wait maybe sent house? house strip naked entering don’t infect kids. Maybe it’s there. God knows, wouldn’t know, live hotels call rooms. I’ve lived last 6 months we’re “turning corner” spinning circles like maladjusted psychotic dog one balls put it’s refrigerated truck. keeping money? know that’s we’re keeping bodies. bodies people happened diagnose Covid make couple extra bucks. Because, yeah, I’m life. That’s learned stupid medicine science. That’s dedicated life trying save people peddle bullshit mass super spreader event call political rally. fuck it?  governments dont get involved actually start making laws enforcing them, give til Summer, it'll MUCH worse. 

People ICU crying fake news/hoax dying breaths. Virtual viewing?? mean understand guess, that’s awful. lot people going struggle getting closure loss loved one this. 

I’m sorry loss wish didn’t go this. know two people died COVID. Elderly people lived shut-ins since March. wonder much really helps. even groceries delivered. Currently contact tracing trying walk backwards couple could contracted it. [We're turning Halloween, Thanksgiving Christmas probably mass graves. 101k according Worldometer enemy nuked Yellowstone? fucked wasting nuke? Nice see state staying low. likely rise soon, good job. it! I'm expert and, course, hope I'm wrong: think what's going happen USA going go Christmas record number active cases... everyone's going say ""LOL Coronavirus"" get together holidays travel January going basic slaughterhouse. virus drilled well public, Americans celebrating Xmas help get places already reached.

I'm American dog fight, Trump re-elected additional layer ""Everything fine. Keep businesses open. listen doctors scientists."" make situation already went bad worse go worse apocalyptic. That's dont see gloom/doom commenters talking daily deaths... leveled September, despite cases exploding since then.

Unless deaths rise similar fashion, cases means virus safer thought (more lmao murdered guy mean, Chief Executive spray tan, makeup, lifts shoes consistently he’s air, who’s judge little makeup then? American exceptionalism! sure people judged Sweden successful. Different, yes, marathon leading started fall months later. Evry country weighed economy safety pyaing price both. Obama save Lincoln Civil War? let Lincoln die. Checkmate Leebruls.


*shoves dildo ass* fine. Everything fine 🔥🔥😐😑😐 We’re number one! Florida voters interviewed Daily podcast said don’t blame Trump virus situation. “It’s China’s fault, “ said. Wow. wanted throw phone across room hearing that, I’ve looking job since April can’t afford new one. mind boggles pandemic partisan issue.

It's simply beyond comprehension

You would think literally 100% people would like ""ahhh shit got mask another 6 months? Fucken bummer man "" *puts mask on* either don’t understand statistics haven’t actually looked data. Germany cannot effectively control pandemic, much harder less orderly countries. stimulus want 22+ millions americans starve? need stimulus, national state local unified plan. [We're turning Space Force Day! misinformation. 

[There 43,000 people hospital coronavirus, according the COVID Tracking Project, 30,000 beginning Wow yeah really well said. bad people vote don’t seem get this? they’re loud ones? Even Reddit sometimes? I’m saying post trump, there’s legion followers still going act reckless. I’m sure Hillary, would stayed fringe believe stuff. FYI EEG brain scan, tell anything useful human brain, apart whether seizure. I’ve seen neurologists try read things. complete BS. settles that. big lie, ya big dummy. follow murdoch media please. guys great! every parent see public masks let germ factories/crotch goblins run around without spread snotty faces EVERYTHING  happy COVID response currently am

You're US, right? You’ll know we’re fucked real Lions even get SB, much less win one. fact, win one playoff game season I’d probably head hills post game pressers. Impeach Trump what? Within 3 months? delusional. F K E N E W Covid bowls concern bottleneck production distribution. 
 
The needels, vials, techs, refrigeration, much infrastructure required. really hope I'm wrong we're prepared think whole lot current government done gives lot hope. are, corner want turning... Paramedic recovering covid. Yes better able treat it. lockdown back March HUGELY beneficial us time study virus develop treatments.

I started chest pain fever, went ER spent 2 days hospital. Dimer 700, higher normal critically so. test shows developed clots system, measures breakdown clots. However, someone heart attack before, high risk treated lovenox (blood thinner) CT angiogram look pulmonary embolism. worry kidneys shutting down, frequent result covid.

For critical patients, also Dexamethasone remdesivir, help. orderlies hospital told back March 60 people vents. said like war zone hospital (this Chicago). Last weekend 10. think would come much worse gotten back then.

The reason got employer refuses people work home frequently said ""masks work"" super Pro Trump. swept office like wildfire. button must pushed. check oxygen levels? Seriously jealous guys. Legit nice job. good friend mine Melbourne, he's told easy task. Hope guys keep stay healthy safe!! :) That's nonsense positivity rates hospitalization numbers up. Excuse fit Reddit narrative. Every Covid death direct fault comander cheif. ROFL! course virus controlled. Multiple countries done it, China Vietnam Australia New Zealand. governments incompetent even care less, that's 700 deaths per million people entire bloc world &lt;20 deaths per million. gop plan. Burn down, blame Democrats. last comment-that’s exactly I’m afraid national scale. wouldn’t bothered people packed unmasked shoulder shoulder local Trump rallies screaming conspiracy hoaxes weren’t going grab dinner drinks, retail therapy, grocery shopping potentially infecting employees places option staying home. many positives.because test /s Sort of. since comes American anti-Trump POV, rather outright denying China succeeded like American right wing copium does, reframes China’s success attack Trump administration failing handle epidemic thus “allowing” China comparatively succeed promote said success. makes sure remind readers commit ideological apostasy trying draw lessons China, rather channel cognitive dissonance hating Trump more. Well CFR jumps high, also part testing limitations case counts get high. start able test symptoms worse.

The IFR never gets 1% majority cases asymptomatic mild, testing misses many cases, **especially** huge outbreak. point testing capacity overrun cases? Man child government wouldn’t trusted info compared Canadian eu governments anyways Well, 0 single digit. polling nice firm 0. US better europe, less population density warmer temperatures.... added 480 case Manitoba today, cases added previous day totals.  went code red lockdown.  Grocery stores 50% occupancy, gyms 25% masks even working out, retail stores 25%. Restaurants bars closed take out/delivery / curb side pickup.  

Schools still open two schools unschool transmission past 2 months. 

Can still restrict test positivity city 9.x cut elective surgeries bringing nurses retirement get ready. Hi-five Seattle Yup, apply rates recent demographics get 0.7%.  Actually 1 month hard nation-wide lock would stop tracks. Otherwise something spreads exponentially we're screwed. Imma lock down. look snapmap around country even world. Lots partying. Eat glass. Yeah, great government arrests people exercising fundamental rights voice disagreement policies. major tv show dedicating 4 hours election coverage. world holding breath Update: went house today lady living apologized wearing mask passing us afterward work room 30 mins stayed four outs zoom call. windows open anything I’m pointing fingers idea safety that’s gonna lead us bad road. I’m pointing fingers case it’s commonplace it’s contributing behavior. true. avg person won’t bothered look understand relate. positivity rate def one everyone using, 

but it’s confusing scaring people.

 example, sister lives medium sized town way upstate, thinks it’s big town city, think it’s tiny sticks.. getting 1 case every days summer. saw rate go one percent like 17% week shut schools crossed threshold. less 100 people actually it. worst day ever 12 people saw daily increases hundreds percents went 1-4-10 etc.. back 3 4 cases day. She’s terrified living absolute fear kid husband catch it. 

I live hot spot, comparison. next town locked down. getting 1000 cases day one point. went way single digits summer. it’s back like 50ish spike last month getting 100 daily. 

Still 100 cases “12% positivity” means 1200 people getting tested like 100k zip code. like 12%... 1%. likely people reason tested, sick, exposed, contracted via contact tracing. good system here, works, we’re terrified rate back 1% now, still almost amount cases, flattened curve fast tons people rushing get tested. 50 coming positive we’re 1% means 5000 getting tested now. rate drops super low again. it’s misleading 4x testing occurring.

The community got locked threatened stop taking tests lower “positivity rate” protest “being singled out” (religious community, shocker!) realized fast people get rushed er get tested rate 100% even couple cases. 

They seem gotten somewhat control fast though. We’re better March, April May sure. we’re aware big spike could easily around corner. 

They random sampling’s would difficult get enough people truly random good representation populace let shove q tip feels like brain lol. thought Trump defeated coronavirus???? whole sub doesn’t think alike U A, U We’re number 1. We’re number 1!!!!!! Suck world!!!!! news 100% quarantine every night dinner, BLM protests.  heard looting.

My wife like, “is quarantine over?”

They stopped telling us cared BLM civil unrest instead.

I hate politics. representative democracy precisely issues like this. gov time resources normal citizens figure best weigh interests. takes balls since come terms fact may scapegoated voted people like it. easier blame messenger actual issue. lot Republicans feel like could go back normal stopped caring covid. still don’t care 😎 Ok, bot. ""ask Kim"" blog posted included one study study take account infection rate already declining states time, comparison states made. study published, infections began increase states mask mandates. good job !! reason Fauci also deflecting attempts goad Trump. counterproductive. There's amount shaming scolding would ever make Trump change mind. poking orange crude bear slim chance formulating executing actual plan. even eventually shut like upstaged someone smarter. worst part Biden wins they'll blame him. Ok troll hunter No, restrictions, like every place isn’t China. Sweden “no lockdown” story bullshit. Yesterday day also new records. much “turning corner” server area weird love-hate relationship big families groups come crowd restaurant five kids/teens, friends, run around, scream, shout, etc, like it’s 2019. We’re spiking setting new case records daily now, keep judging resenting them, knee-jerk reaction walk door, wanting ask fuck they’re dining closed restaurant, currently filled groups families, instead trying help rest humanity staying fuck home cooking!?!!? “six foot rule” tables isn’t really going help anyone you’re sitting shouting small, closed dining room without masks you’re eating!

Then remember make $2.13 hour need tips, I’m family. Correlation Election Day 3 days? Nahhh it’s actually half country inside virus spreads quicker way. People need stop listening president start putting hand sanitizer on. ""This fine"" Dog/fire meme perfectly describes like half people US. Like could literally fire yet deny point them. It’s almost we’re neither flawless utopia *or* murderous hellhole! 🤔🤔  current death rate, yes , surge number new cases, however surge number deaths, death rate still staggeringly low.  TAIWAN #1 living failed state like. intents purposes, federal government right now. completely decapitated. leadership what-so-ever. fact many ways worse federal government we're actively lied people actively *encouraged* defy local health measures. 

The result deaths millions time done ravaging country. 

I want Nuremberg level trials this. means going far rope god damned Fox News interns created graphics downplaying virus tried found guilty aiding abetting biological terrorism. literal horror show. Holy moly. think China plays huge role politicization well? know spasm blame Trump everything great some, come on, China huge asshole virus start. Germany France announced lockdowns, rest EU lot political pressure well. Especially consider Germany around 2 weeks behind countries, yet among first anniunce full lockdown (Ireland Wales first two).

So far, Belgium, Austria, rumours England Monday. shocked places like Italy/Czech/Holland announcing one already fffuuuuuuck top almost entire country testing asymptomatics true US Almost 1/4 million people dead now. Incredible. Yeah. sucks everything back normal party them. It’s better way anyway live Northeastern US date Winter. looking forward freezing.  Welp fuck great thing people Taiwan safely exercise freedoms virus going around.  they're going bar large gatherings they've probably already gotten it. people mild symptoms. Since affect them, give fuck. Bozeman, Montana State 16k students person town 42k. locals taking serious themselves. We’re scary spot stands fighting chance. diabetic grandmother cancer-surviving grandfather beat COVID - mid-80s.  Based percentage population, America 20 times infections Australia. We're STILL PPE issues? Really? world's wealthiest country still can't get proper PPE. Safe approach superspreader event like one. I'm concerned mine too, also 91 covid yet know of. grandma gonna pull through. matter 5% 75% get overrun. people can’t care anything month, 6 months best. Covid’s bad yeah, wait til planet starts punishing us giving attention deserves. 

We fucking suck, really thing completely control many, many months, reliable understanding IFR is? maybe enough data guess CFR might end being? think failure act early damaging. could contain virus closely monitor people travel find contain outbreaks get control. Many far eastern countries contained virus way countries China continued economic growth.

The US many others gave partial lockdowns flatten cure letting spread slowly rate hospitals handle. slow spread damaging apparently irreversible unless super effective vaccine found. lockdowns late damaging economy. Even lift lockdowns, still can't get many people leisure travel dining activities involving large crowds. lack demand services damaging economy. Many families may cancel Christmas. understand it’s hard people Zoom event real wedding/party,etc. cousins Bar Bat Mitzvah’s Zoom wouldn’t hold breath vaccine. There’s many unknowns challenges vaccine. path forward probably rapid testing contact tracing. rates infection, none may matter. sort ""stimulus"" assistance program there? least focus ACTUAL facts. part problem.

Yes, lockdown extremely effective I’m extremely, extremely grateful it. still people thought top broke rules, went 700 daily cases one zero time. 700 daily population size Victoria actually quite large, pretty scary. said that, it’s bloody difficult mentally. it! ...below 20% humidity??

*Confused Floridian noises* seem sensitive spot people advising extreme caution buying products meant save lives random sellers eBay Amazon. 

One could even imply/suspect might “self interest” this, might actually seller masks eBay?

If think that’s unfair assessment, would suggest also stop implying /u/coll0412 sort self-serving agenda advising people source masks eBay Amazon. buy legit stuff eBay &amp; Amazon? course can. average person supposed “smart it”? can’t test masks efficiency buying them. Expecting normal people spend time becoming “smart” weed fake masks internet ridiculous expectation, tell buy known vendors consistently sourced products independently tested efficacy.

I rarely get sick medication dried nose caused nose bleeds getting sick constantly. immunosuppressant, messed nose. help I'm nurse sick people coughing face day. catching cold nearly every month fall/winter. absurd bring since 100% undermine argument. claim censor cover everything...and talk massive scandal know failed censor Chinese social media. politicized selectively abused. attitude ""this activity okay, one isn't"" jaded people made content think virus matters convenient invoke. not. happened ends disappointing existential basis. Uhm China prolomged lockdowns? draconian ones believe first wave, belgium one view countries without unexplained excess dead. Italy/France covid accounted half excess death. 

No blame countries failling accurate reporting, people first line need choose dealing patient filling reports BioEdge favorite source huh? Also known 2005, MercatorNet Australian online review, MercatorNet uses loaded language headlines articles. selection heavily favors conservative causes right-wing political agenda, as: “The left way dangerous loony white supremacists“, “Hilllary Clinton right: feminist pro-life” “Is Trump new Constantine?” MercatorNet also sometimes publishes Onion like satirical articles “Exclusive: Trump get Nobel Peace Prize”.

You embarradssed using source anything. 

and BBC embarradsed using Latifa Löfvenberg source. Please translate article ”business partner” Jon Tallinger.

[Dr. Whistleblower Nurse openly rascist far right trolls frequently whine islamisation Europe. Jon Latifa started FB group ”Oxygen all!” quietly promising procure oxygen needed Sweden 6 million video itself, Löfvenberg asked Tallinger many patients died due ""you get oxygen"". Löfvenberg answers first ""I know numbers"", ""maybe couple"" finally ""ten cases"". even Löfvenberg's experiences correct, objectively, relation Sweden's population, ""humanitarian catastrophe"", Tallinger Löfvenberg believe.

I understand cannot know everything Sweden are. please, please basic fact check narratives pushing. Congratulations France still lower total cases deaths per captia. watching said astonished adult could say something incompetent. Let alone someone kind authority. would ridiculous coming coach addressing college football kids. sub wanted nothing stay dystopia never wanted back normal yeah happy call flu ""European Covid"" want see family, shelter place one household duration lockdown. issue people long everyone going house quarantines individually 2 weeks first truly live together lockdown (don't visit weekend). time! Tony team her. Speak truth. We're still shitting bed, lol. Never. Parliament many months debate happens prefisely situation? like unexpected. didn’t want spread panic talk potentially bad news every day break records counts, hospitals filling risk sending health system crash

We Americans, Europeans. democracies try leave anyone behind let citizens die.

So seems obvious lockdwon. also taken account lot cases lower viral loads mask use. Earlier virus spread people leading severe outcomes, whereas people wearing masks reducing amount virus spread others. fatality rates doesn’t mean virus isn’t dangerous. stopped wearing masks would see lot severe outcomes. 75 percent infections **cannot traced back**. UK cvs test results say “value invalid standard range negative” 

Is test invalid test negative? 

Please help!! USA USA USA Problem always report free icu beds simply personnel actually care patients We're ""rounding corner"" reelect orange fuck still take seriously dreams come true. USA USA US(cough cough)a usa, cough. (Uh oh). I'm sure nothing, reason cancel dinner plans packed restaurant. weekend many parties go restaurants use last time lockdown. Didn’t 4.3% France die Second World War? Come even covid went nuts wouldn’t happen. mean take Trumps words face value, that's bad. Maybe APC armed police would access to. Effective lockdowns save blue collar jobs. Ineffective lockdowns destroy industry. Look countries tool Covid serious: China, Australia, Vietnam, Taiwan. people work economies starting again. Meanwhile repeating nonsense administration claimed April destroying economy now. Maybe natives get land back white man die 99.4% honest here. Why? Jeff Bezos never much money. amazing! U. S. A!

U. S. A! ever recover User name checks France, Japan, Korea, China... lot places give America run 'most racist'. even 1p/5sqm, supermarkets didn´t check many inside.  problem getting flu shot catch COVID getting flu shot. tell currently Apples Headquarters! Can't Germany close doors Europe? Even part EU still sovereign nation. That's lockdown v1. Wait, hospitalizations lag infections, deaths hospitalization? Whaaaaa? love sound bite eagle freedom screeching

But actually sound red-tailed hawk bald eagle sounds like oversized sea gull. one day 'just disappear', certainly miracle, it'll result hard work, community effort, incredible research. Yeah makes absolutely fucking sense. I'm hoping they'll close shit next week cases likely rise. would dumbest thing ever. don’t think Nordic countries that. RemindMe! 2 months Hard Satans Tangerine keep calling China Virus it’s clearly claimed America  right hell dont think, happy that. I'm trying objective much possible, honestly, still dont know right approach handle situation. countries managed ok-ish manner, countries different EU countries example (isolated country like NZ, different mindset/regime Asian countries). many questions without answers, people mostly reluctant accept lockdown (insecure income, fear isolation, etc..). 

I love idea get whole population tested, government had/has issues communicate properly, creates big confusion, fully understand. Please repeat herd immunity nonsense. Meanwhile Chinese scientists always masks. know say every year worst allergy year record nobody believes it, reason say every year every year literally worse last? 

That, coronavirus days. seems like certain level community spread impossible control without prolonged lockdowns (unless China). Well Trump didn’t amazing job has, would 23 billion dead! Whats death rate?

More tests = positive cases

Add unreliable testing system shown high percentage false positives.

This politically driven. work hospital lab, get one keep job. Got shot couple weeks ago fine, thousands coworkers. Exactly. restaurant temp check require use automatic sanitizer hands enter. woman went haywire front kids.  felt really bad them. White House: see, told Fauci got wrong! crazy percentage American Christmas gatherings coronavirus *absence due died catching thanksgiving*. 98% cases similar flu. bad small scale. know 10+ people got it, 2 high morbidities. fine without complications. That’s crazy. round number it! win? feel like arseholes would wear masks virus started States recommended. might even patriotic.

As is, aren’t going something “Communist China &amp; European Socialists” mandated. they’re saying it, must anti-freedom! 🙄 Im making homemade pizza maybe treat(I make treats time, maybe not) husband going play sort real life ""baldi"" ""grannys house"" surprise. 7&amp;4 year olds stoked today, even though told arent going trick treating. (This canadian city lower numbers many. Can't careful) allow tamper facts make point, prepared circumstances change. 

Some left’ish media find real dilemma old statements conclusions. f???????????why Oh crap, hope little one gets better soon! WASH HANDS? USA FREEDOM CONSTITUTION PROTECTS RIGHT WHATEVER FUCK WANT. 

- Karen Skeeter McAmerican downright fact.

this also downright fact:

[Neandertal gene variant increases risk severe Europe, one six people carry risk variant, Africa East Asia almost non-existent.

So let’s jump conclusion difference see East Asia Europe solely different measures strategies. almost certainly not. forget Black Friday. empty parts hospitals due reduction/elimination surgeries. doesn’t mean covid ward(s) aren’t overwhelmed ready break. based things hospital spring, he’ll see real soon making lot money. Hospitals going broke pandemic. income/expenditures care way better regular times covid patients. countries politics entertainment sure funny seasonal flu cases 95%.


PLEASE, explain me. 


This CDC reporting number, me. 



You peolle fucking stupid testing Civil War 2.0 starts. USA wrote playbook pandemic response threw away. countries well used protocols originally established US looking situation horrified disbelief. Please educate yourself. subreddit tell otherwise. hard stop ignorant. flu already here. completely closed borders, already cases popping coasts. stupid. Yes, unfortunately Slovak employers threatening fire people get tested, easy. Personally, I'm wishing Jeff Bridges fast full recovery possible! mean lied us again?!? wonder keeps getting death threats /s Except that's really true. swedish authorities flattened curve encouraging social distancing.

Is really different strategy country used recommendations instead rules, amount social distancing achieved same? Florida here. Everything open one gives shit. Road 100k, huh. Y'all great. Lol think half asses response something don’t know tell you. 

It’s equivalent nothing it’s getting R 1. 

Work healthcare see yourself. seems like really really high positivity rate. I'm Canada (and boy, second wave real rough) Canadian health website, shows 2.2%. numbers doctored Biden ad. Men? Humans general. Women nasty creatures. Teacher Southwest here... I'd ecstatic limited measures right measure aside masks class (which kids take recess... I'd facepalm harder I'd give concussion) 

Shit's hit fan already propelled towards jet turbine... gonna get worse snowbirds doubly flooding get away hot spots home cold grandma nurse nursing home (kinda ironic think it) everyone got it. residents died docs sent home die nothing could do. made retired. Seems broke spirit. America reach group immunity vaccine ready whole system followed for

Been paying attention past four years?

Trump’s recent executive order dissolved protections you’re referencing (almost certainly Fauci one targets crosshairs): ""fact"" contracted stage 4 colon cancer trying digest ads beautifully illustrated article information accessible. We’re Number 1! prediction yet long take total infection US? Sadly (Slovakia) around 20% positivity rate :( sad pathetic. century pandemic, everyone, country, around world, working together.....

Instead, messed situation. admin made effective response country impossible, argued prior action last 3 years left entire world worse shape deal this. Democracy failed. risks getting shot incredibly tiny. doctor actually go medical school? hard time believing MD would say that. really people working food stores like? Never going happen. never fully lock down. time control came went. relied geography, masks.  Kansas, Northeast. seriously anti mask.  August group people stood outside convenience store rather enter wearing mask. Fine me.  Yeah. That’s absolutely horrific. 

But think fair compare Europe/EU US. EU country US state. Conditions vary lot states time. dummy saying systematic racism exist felt need correct him. Turns post even go sub requires users account that's least one month old. 

Bunch pansies little echo chamber  Spain also USA, Italy U.K. 600 weeks, feeling government going week shutdown nationwide school holiday (half-term). would make sense working parents would already arrangements kids school.

That week. happen. Nothing improved. Johnson huffing saying something next week. Thanks... guess? odd. first COVID-19 devil people's eyes, avoid costs. meant first wave pretty chilled 6months later suddenly nobody cares anymore. People care get tested, bother wear masks properly think repercussions. think trend we'll see lot countries first wave bad. sure hope not. Well... deserve one does...

... mean one gleefully enjoy karmic undertones situation... Positive case rate: 37% literally worst fear right health professional. hope make it! Lol. clear consider left, im dissapointed international left taking opportunity turn concervatives arguments them.

I 100% agree this. NYTs, Washington Post Guardian spent much time painting Sweden failure ignoring much strategy rested robust sick leave caregivers leave plus idea lockdowns increase inequalities aspects health. fact instituting full sick leave caregivers leave even agenda US instance shows badly American left failed trying pass systematic reforms would improve health citizens general. 

I particularly disturbed keeping schools open US framed morally repugnant, completely ignoring public school system one important equalizing institutions modern democracies.

I think Swedish approach numerous failures countries take similar approach. think constant focus deaths per capita cases ignores aspects health well-being population. Pretending like lockdowns extremely harmful vulnerable members society delusional. capacity health system threatened absolutely appropriate, morally clear thing downsides. Mine too. hate neighbors.  weather get bad, people gather indoors much dangerous. thing happened Southern Hemisphere’s winter (our summer) summer southern states people stayed indoors air conditioning. ""The odds primary case transmitted COVID-19 closed environment 18.7 times greater compared open-air environment (95% confidence interval [CI]: 6.0, 57.9). "" choice person classes depends Professor also don’t forget dorms &amp; sports session too. Professor broke us groups semester attend Monday classes Wednesday online...it dumb asf. rounding corner! country allowed leave house reason except get meds, groceries, essential work 1 hour day exercise within 2km house. someone visited holiday home lockdown announced, stay there. Emergency powers enforced legally. Spain locked harder that. Yes China drastic that. Isaac Newton explained many years ago Yeah one party particular restricting rights. true No, wine , must make winter die Yet deaths go good news [top piece posted [here report (this one): 24.7% mortality April, 13.3% June.

NY Langone report (NYT): 25.6% mortality April, 7.6% August.

One commenter Reddit claimed (without supporting evidence, looked original research find any) NY Langone system overwhelmed, accounting high mortality. matter fact US healthcare system April held up, even though stressed. (You may remember USS Mercy NY Harbor, well field hospitals setup across NYC, [taken due without treating patients.)

Similar story Sweden, [not overwhelmed 

Bottom line: better treatment methods (delaying ventilation, prone positioning, high O2 cannulas, remdesivir dexamethasone treatments) probably lower infective dose innoculum due mask-wearing social distancing. Cannot discount sheltering vulnerable, also unknown whether deadly variants virus also play.

Source: scientist training reads lot original literature, process publishing book COVID-19 run wine....l I’ll die! I’m sorry ❤️ still can't believe waiting long, UK cases charts Probably writing thank notes... know got it? Anyone ever stopped thought themselves, President isn’t scared covid, be? Might know something don’t? mean man literally obese older, yet recovered fine. Yeah hive mind sub really doesn’t understand this. Yeah, expecting huge problem happening next weeks lame duck period going help us. Trump pretty much going fuck mar lago next 3 months people dying stimulus bill going pass help anyone January.  Pretty much massively fucked.  

The fucked part republicans literally killing voting base.  literally cutting nose spite face. joking Australia prison better US. Australia big empty. Asians, think, collectively willingness sacrifice others respect science.  3 hours waiting line, around 200 people tested far since morning place on, positives far.

This could much better organized, goverment would atleast try prepare action summer. No, I’m making opposite argument. argument things look bad high number cases due high testing capacity. People trying say US better countries lower percent positivity. I’m saying higher testing proving we’re badly STILL percent positivity that’s high. matter spin it, would either look bad tested less percent positivity would higher, looks bad we’re testing much percent positivity still high. says objectively high number cases per capita. Lmao actually insane. know world works? People sub man lol Give number, i'll set straight! need factor last time around spring, testing capabilities pathetic. can’t compare confirmed cases today’s numbers. 

If anything, look hospital ICU admissions get better comparison situations. seeing Trumpy beat virus like nothing, I’m longer worried. take vitamin zinc, wear mask im chillin. I'm assuming saw, least limited lockdown schools confirmed closed longer planned may ineffectual US guess congrats? COVID-19 mortality rate declines significantly worldwide, thank goodness. understand better treat effectively. waves largely...

_Previous waves?_ recall BBC news article last couple days US never got first wave first place. Riots. really. aspect people forgetting countries mask mandates many anti-maskers like US, they're still getting it. selfish Americans refuse wear mask. realize much track unable to, least legally, current moment. instance body activity index. track every breath motion order deem valid worker system...

- can't shit month, people month's worth food money shit hole country. appear far willing take vaccine women. Four ten men said would strongly agree vaccinated compared 27 per cent women. double number women (18 per cent) said strongly vaccine, compared men

This surprises me. Usually women seem care health men. Weird. Montanan. ICUs full.

Full.

The pandemic real severity, matter hometown friends telling you. It’s crowded. Going supermarket seems massively dangerous this. Well US confirm many new cases yesterday China entire pandemic.

But guess that's fake news right? Well that's simple. People use common sense expose vulnerable people like family members. people society vulnerable avoid people protect themselves. Social distancing that. Honestly, haven’t left house single fucking time since March parents high risk group. guess I’m lucky able keep job WFH pandemic. I’m introvert yet feel dreaded depressed able go outside. Come on, Let’s get with. can’t take anymore. Oh know 2000 day US number. I'm saying seems low considering fact even deep winter 1000 day. president denial. people can't bothered wear mask. hospitals overwhelmed 1k/day, deaths occur treatments rationed. 3000+ seems likely. RIP America. thought heavily implied one scene problem actually men? Either I'm mixing Handmaid's Tale Children Men. collated source hospital data near real time always going fishy. CDC monitor trends hot spots. hospital groups monitor capacity. politics got involved impacted ability outsiders either, impacted policy care.

Yeah living precautions one dozens vaccines (a dozen final stage) Pfizer Moderna going approve next month effective burden. Mentally compressed K12 layman. Hey. 95 year old neighbor kicked Covid teeth. Dont start thinking worst yet. Grandmas tough old birds grandma could well around long yet. Thank right. It’s frustrating heck feel like you’re responsible others burn house down. We’ve stayed home since March. haven’t store entire time. I’m even angry anyone I’m disappointed. recreation staff, I'm rec therapist ltc home currently set-up virtual visits time. That’s thought. Let's forget causes death. 

It feels like testing eradicate mortality now. late Feb, Chinese colleague said early action &amp; elimination strategy (stop transmission within borders), could past worst June. UK response ‘costs high.’ November &amp; 2nd lockdown - cost approach? What’s really crazy Europe even worse day yesterday:

New cases per million October 30th:

US: 306

Europe: 404

France: 753, Spain: 547, UK: 359, Italy: 514, Belgium: 2061, Netherlands: 648, Poland: 572, Czechia: 1271, Switzerland: 1061, Portugal: 457, Austria: 625, Hungary: 340, Ireland: 153, Denmark: 205, Iceland: 228, Germany: 230 hadn’t happened, denials would coming hard fast. Sweden wants protect misguided approach excess deaths good plan. gotten sticker mail ballot. anyone recent breakdown test positivity rate country? find old data Google. Australia NZ isolate. European countries can't.

EU ready event administrative level...and still isn't. lost fight beginning level individual countries inside common market union mandate handle full strength union top level (unlike say China).

It's blasted unfinished state entity frozen half-way towards federalization, demands one willpower become one. (not delving whether it, stay current limbo long, going get worse).

This excuse screw-ups individual countries (like mine), without effective central coordination would end bad place anyway unless EU neighboring countries would somehow magically cooperate agree effective responses within short time frame. That's just...impossible, especially considering vast rogue activities COVID disinformation front certain European countries...

The USA hand sad. theory better position handle EU Republican-led administration declared open war citizens due long-term battle opposition.

That simply failure mismanagement. treason. Pakistan similar population density India poorer done better job. Indian leadership screwed big time. Yes we're talking US. urinal intentional. 

Oh totally. time, meme going around highschool shitting urinals tank toilet (i.e. ""upper decker""). 

A ""friends"" thought would funny stop work drop deuces urinal randomly. got bad ended following one bathroom interrupted mid loaf pinch. yelled something like ""What fuck Graham‽"" pinched off, pulled pants, booked there.

What's funny incident actually led urinal shitter becoming pretty good friends ended apologizing even briefly grindcore band together called ""Eat Shit Die"". actually continued decently successful musician! was, yes. 

But information actually change know estimate infection fatality rate. early predictor rising cases.

We know we're missing infections, estimates IFR cases pretty stable last months. may missing around half cases summer now, likely much that. missing waaaay April though. 

They believe missing new cases France UK Poland now, way half. However predicting lower IFR already estimate (around 0.6-1.3% broad community spread - Italy outlier due perhaps level overwhelmed hospitals March April) far deaths coming weeks would expect looking cases own. question is, point longer worth effort? assume working vaccine amount people high risk go down, even vaccine 100% effective everyone cant vaccined.
At point reach level even people still dying, rest world cant stop functioning normally.

It might sound cold, told done avoid overcrowding hospital, one gets sick. really supposed wait virus gone going back normal life? Sadly, saw coming decades ago. exact scenario, that's specific requires way much knowledge international goings-on. terrible response, apathy, right line everything else that's happened last decades.

Do something benefit powerful now. collapses, rush patchwork fix look good get things barely functional. Make new scheme (or rebrand old one) benefit powerful again. Ignore rest population outside culture wars election marketing. Rinse, repeat. one thinks relative die without family advised made part decision. That’s way US works. don’t think that’s way welfare states work either. People Sweden don’t agree approach taken without consultation. flying to? There's lot well dressed cave men merica. well dressed mean clothed. Way go, Kyle... No, Linear growth means grow stead rate regardless current numbers. exponential would mean current numbers increase growth rate increases. I'm ya, living start rot me. Good luck immortality. COVID19 two weeks acute symptoms, stays apparently stays long time.

For fraction&lt; cases.

None people know Covid lingering chronic issues, friends friends.

And none famous people got Covid got chronic longterm issues.

So common longterm issues? relative claims ""plandemic"" global control, starting masks slowly take away freedoms instill global dictatorship. quite sure ""they"" are. competition like going moon smdh. ""Maybe put box back together.""

""Impossible. opened like ape."" ones dead suffer long-term health consequences well families friends. lucky nuke billing systems 

If unlucky nuke patient records I’m neither disingenuous, picking absolute lowest value compare to. would have, would said UK testing 18.14 times today. Check chart math yourself. It’s really easy obvious. 

And please get facts straight attacking someone, please.

Facts matter times. clarifying false statements data. matter opinion is. 

It might (and perhaps not) affect anyone’s opinion new lockdown, don’t argue using expect done that's already done? Lots arm chair experts sub Ended renting cabin remote area. It’s strange go town everyone wearing masks. home town 3/4 people refuse wear mask. wish community slight bit smarter. least case would attending parties big events tens others could get infected spread families.. putting healthy person months fatigue older person casket. going put like happy? Halloween? it’s better way y’all it, safe one, try keep socialized partying minimum, let’s try set new records.  get reelected, statistically possible. could 15 million people die people still say ""it's 5%."" Fauci lied US mitigation virus masks prevent shortages hospitals.

That's like badmouthing MacGyver around here. might soon find comment ability limited one every ten minutes. Sarcasm aside, seeing spikes waves, think looking breakdown human species.
I hope effective vaccine comes soon lose lives, since looking like can't control spread behavior modifications. Looking you, USA! 18 million what? Dead? Get here... say downsides? look numbers. mention friends tell everything ok, even true, doesn’t mean everything ok everyone. 

I’ve seen hospitals overrun NYC, temporary tents refrigerator morgues. That’s El Paso now. 

I wouldn’t dismiss stories easily. 

Places beds getting hammered virus widespread. Hope die r/confidentlyincorrect

Let's round take 10 million total cases US today. population 330 mill generally assumed threshold 60 - 70% herd immunity, takes 198 - 231 million infections. So, US anyone else far, far away reaching point. mortality rate 0.5%, would correspond 10 - 11.5 million deaths US alone. acceptable you?

Besides, even clear mid-/long-term immunity individuals achieved. Herd immunity pipe dream stage. explain? mean, pretty sure someone eating cheeseburger near give high blood pressure. :D It’s actually much worse Europe. dA LoCk DOwNs KiLLs MoRe! Yup, worry exhausted closing beds. People holiday going maskless, France, thinking going putter own. knew shit kicking fall. don’t know hospitals stay open staff tired sick. Dude eat 1 sardine put go revolver uses ammo like Rick Grimes crossbow neverending arrows like Daryl?

Or maybe keep simple Samurai Sword?

/S many cases take people realize virus big Control must live it. Shut downs fit next years cannot answer.  Something showing common sense agout virus Hey US citizen living Ph. Duterte fucking things up, dont think charge anymore.

 One thing noticed though, yes, lot Filipinos seem tired mask wearing face shield mandate, think majority compliant public spaces. cant go mall without mask faceshield combo right? seems soft deterrent.

I happy response, relatives losing jobs, silver lining find least, they're adding incompetence Duterte's administration blatantly anti maskers, politicizing something simple god damn wearing god damn mask ""my freedom rights!"" that, give Filipino common man credit. trUmp treated covid: PlS donT let DiiIiEEEEE IM SCARED!!. TrUmP treated: iM iNmUnE CoViD wonder he's suggested drone strike like Clinton American adversaries. leadership people generally care. Mask usage never good noticed change last weeks. Bars restaurants still full drove around last night. Well fact flu pneumonia deaths year.

It seems like number people *would have* killed those, killed Covid instead. Based recent causes death data cdc website Well agree behavior president extremely irresponsible.... sorry typed bunch stuff deleted it. I’m disappointed virus politicized GOP could act irresponsible, seems people don’t care texas here. got curb side takeout last night inside restaurant fun people. everyone tired distance masks wants normal life return. problem right time complacent. Yeah, hundred cases summer added back in, 3400 number isn’t exactly accurate. would like think attitude problem would somewhat adjusted overall society overall income inequality addressed lowered. many people express misery taking minorities rather true culprits

I disappointed find psychic.

Also realized idea sub I'm even replying this. Lol 'common sense' American here.

East: science says need wear mask. Let’s wear mask mindful other.

United States: Yes, condition.

It takes 1-2 idiots ruin 8 people room who’s taking seriously.

The story beloved country. Christian values science, people like infuriating. Except it’s nowhere near 1% unless you’re high risk group.  is. J&amp;J vaccine frontrunner timeline, huge potential important contributor driving back spread disease. combination single-shot regime much manageable storage requirements make far suitable countries regions poor logistics and/or healthcare infrastructure. Really sorry loss. people can't wrap thier head around reality always feel should. I’m sorry. go her. Hey, 15 days past. going ? He's Dutch I'm Belgian , bit insider discussion. know sentiment applies cases official deaths , merely offered explanation case deaths. past, long covid, guilty naught. I’d go work sick, bad. Coughing constantly, nose pouring snot, red hot sore throat, spitting trash can. Looking back, can’t believe ever considered ok, I’m ashamed myself. need extremely strict policies every work place can’t come you’re sick. Every company needs unlimited mandatory paid sick time funded government. fix neighbor's lack empathy?

The government response something help improve voting. neighbor, honestly, empathy hope get sick. meant say Correlation != Causation, you? problem is, playing covid, force others play covid. way, Russian Roulette bad comparison. Ya called herd immunity would say maybe 66% infected based r0 factor Think way this. Disagree wish.

Yes, told need lockdown prevent overwhelming hospital covid-care resources. overwhelmed people would die. overall goal keep people dying. overloading hospitals one necessary step overall goal. 

The world going get back 'functioning normally' [your term] people quit dying thousands covid. I'll first admit stopped thought process idea overloading hospitals, loses sight larger reason.

Your next question getting back normal work covid cases fall dramatically. people died it. Let's downplay risk heard yet... Ugh Lol engineering degree, strong suit 

Heres direct link CDC says 6% deaths covid alone, 6% 230,000
Is 13,800 

13,800 people died covid alone, majority people 2.6 comorbidities age 90. 

For somebody thinks they’re smart it’s sad see brainwashed are......  know, that's good idea ... everyone, including crew officers, cruise required swim 4 times day, chlorine would kill lot virus. Then, keep breathing close others... citation this? I've never heard study linking two.  started Spenglee make past chapter Babylobian mathematics. ought finish it. honestly can't tell anymore. ""Firey, mostly peaceful"" Wait, talking UK US? :) actually wondering many protests cause comparison, I'm sure way protests numbers still multitude reasons listed below. better Europe, worse, couple weeks behind curve again. guys bad time... look studies vitamin virus, certainly meletonin skin. like people say holocaust never happened jews deserved it. makes say that? depopulation theories never make sense. UN wanted depopulate world would endorse free abortion contraception around world. would infinitely easier safer fucking virus.  White House declared done!! Liars!!! Guys looking upside down. cases obviously going charts...  late need worry hate shoppers literally hours going lockdown. shopping week long last two weeks. two days ago went stuff, saw handful sad pasta bags like ten packs tp. like 14days ago. people buy stuff ten days time get shocked seeing empty boards. feel like pandemic gas lasted long enough answer question already. fact things bad USA we're effectively nothing federal level jaw dropping. simulation pandemic event 2019 October ('Event 201'). simulations preceding years.

The conclusion last one ""the governments private sector prepared, get act together, maybe years be"".

Well, years it, get act together either. US literally flattened curve, desired scenario guarantee significant overlap people think COVID engineered virus reduce global population *and* time think social distancing measures useless infringements freedom mortality COVID low mean yes, really much choice medications/vaccines get distributed. Sucks profits goal current healthcare system. know, right? Canada kidnaps Chinese woman U.S. (while Trump pardons several cronies actually committed crimes) whines China detaining two Davids. get reading all, although could see could. took two paragraphs separate paragraphs, first ""next year"", ""hugging grandma"", next ""normalcy 5yrs"". me, separate.

Fwiw Australia, I'm from, long told expect vaccine take fully rolled out.

eg, we're expected manufacture doses 2021, us surrounding region, everyone needs two doses. They'll prioritising risk healthcare/quarantine workers first, etc. expectation never vaccine=normalcy within 3mo, we're coming different bases here. Stupid people stupid enough believe democrat takes country fall apart, freedoms taken away, everything free all, thats basically whats slowly happening current incompetent administration. love picture looting rioting saying look like Biden elected happening Trump president. think politicians full shit regardless party, voting Trump isnt voting Law &amp; Order. voting chaos incompetence.  sister wanted parents (who 70s various medical conditions) come meet boyfriend Atlanta stay weekend. One big reasons going Atlanta ""my boyfriend's never coke museum"". guy 53 years old, museum open since 2007. Thirteen years opportunity go think middle global pandemic time go?

Worst part is, works healthcare, still goes bars restaurants. even tried telling parents Covid numbers worse live compared Atlanta. wasn't, numbers 3-4x worse Atlanta parents live.
 
People complain quarantine able things, realize they've x amount years whatever wanted pretty much unrestricted. Taking x amount time get control going kill them. true. I’m convinced anti-Asian sentiment behind lot skepticism behind wearing masks. used think NY best response US. screwing big time reopening much—schools, particular. Yes, schools closing, *some* schools, late. really understand rush get everyone back classroom, easily effectively internet. wars involve bullets. enemies human. Netflix. Going watch tonight, need hopeful movie. Thanks! Would like see hundred videos various protestors rioters wearing masks all, close proximity other? can't believe comments like exist. none say claim.... replace name place name jesus is.  holy spirit everyone... 

jesus creation god like everything else. god even created evolution. math.

If 99.9999% survival rate, everyone earth caught would 8 deaths. 

Worldwide.

There's thing called commonsense. try developing because, currently, it. Go literally city state sub dedicated Rona. CNN headline nearly every day cases. Winter time approaching here. We’ve started supplements 
I really wonder it’s vitamin matter sitting around inside inactive versus outside active Actually tested multiple times throughout. Sure there's honor system again, lots camps way zero infections. lot safer public schools right now. want hide forever bunker go ahead. Seated close proximity others longer duration puts higher risk actively moving around. Whether it’s actually true not, CDC stated short interactions people less risk prolonged exposure people. Also, protests happening much fewer cases, current rallies held continue set break record numbers cases. Proper humidity keeps sinus lung tissue healthy. People live dry environments (whether desert climate winter) consider using humidifier sleeping, least. That’s good practice regardless. wasn’t US went Black Lives Matter protest everyone masked, contact tracing lists, groups certain amount separated marched distance one another. organizers great job tbh. Well, read comments, you’d see have... Please... let out... LET OUTTTTT (eric andre meme)

But fr I'm trapped cage bunch idiots stupidity gunna kill family members. explain men much willing get vaccine. Buncha Peggies.

Been playing lots Far Cry 5 lately, parallels fascinating. Say now: USA! USA! USA! putin's fault. Even without putin facebook ""connecting"" impressionable people extremist groups. Outdoor events mixed mask wearing spread virus. ask protester. ones “in hangars” like “near hangars” 

Also hangar isn’t outdoor space massive open doors flowing air disingenuous here. Holy crap.

Because, dear Watson .. says title Speaking New Zealander, we're pretty damned neoliberal. myth socialist paradise - myth. Whataboutism. group people wear masks, stay home they’re sick, take Covid seriously, better tens thousands people don’t that? Dude, world thank insane level except crackpots inspired US. shit dangerous enough countries close borders us. It’s overblown hoax. I'll take Camacho Trump day. least knew appointment smart people solve issues. OKlahoma point Americans don’t care president irresponsible. act science pandemic denier, put people risk end.... one cares. huge population support President trump re-election despite actions. Americans don’t care leader puts us risk, mocks mask wearing denounces science. cares people love free means many people, remain unavailable. somebody's monthly income time people losing jobs right left, lot people able pay. Here’s thing...I think normalcy coming lot sooner people think vaccine. honestly, normalcy probably coming SOONEr vaccine...but vast swathes US barely listening health officials, vaccine available, going want want immediately resume 2019 life.

There lot strife people states start different times...some people screaming way soon prom big wedding (similar strife saw August schools opening), eventually people come around. 

Now, would say illogical kill lot people strictly scientific approach taken rolling vaccine, making sure infections levels drop, using vaccine one tool NPIs...but mean...clearly people aren’t logical. Yeah would stupid talk. virus goes away *act* make go away, *want* go away. point Americans don’t care president irresponsible. act science pandemic denier, put people risk end.... one cares. huge population support President trump re-election despite actions. Americans don’t care leader puts us risk, mocks mask wearing denounces science. cares people love preprint. journals publish accepted articles online much real time. aware virus humans, herd, developed immunity to. 

But hand, immune virus, would unaware it, we?

We probably immune lots things even think about. parasite salmon kills dogs kill us example. claim herd immunity one.

But never heard deadly disease eventually became less deadly everybody either died got antibodies. ever happened? ignore ones hangars, megachurches, convention centers. Texas. Ft worth citities TX Nobody thinks woman willing settle you.  did, fucking dumb take moment reflect might wrong something. Take chip shoulder shove ass point trusting China equivalent trusting leaders. Yes, good news Stay used years ""We might back semblance normality summer time next year,"" says Prof Julian Hiscox, University Liverpool. ""But 'back 2019' five years,"" ""For people,"" says Prof Woolhouse, ""I suspect life changed degree forever, think going ""There 'new normal'.""

Gee, *want* happen, neither next guy. *university professors* saying things, can't argue logic.

I guess choice stop whining accept ""new"" normal, know. reputable professionals scientists telling us so, believe otherwise would defy science, right? are, many (like recent one Henderson, NV). ones outside still big problem one wearing mask seated place, shoulder shoulder, hours. Trump wants packed together numbers look bigger TV. He's perfect storm arrogance, callousness, fragility stupidity. virus designed champion itself. Ok im gonna argue pandemic hasnt handled awfully tad bit clickbaity death toll nurses WW1 1500.

Id compare pandemics instead. Don’t even want think going turn out, really dark days ahead interpret founding documents static rule law successful operation colonies nation

It's absurd philosophy/outlook based time-traveling back 1700s.

""What would founders do... Hold on, let time-travel back colonial times brain palace"" Sure, see pandemic real reason. know that? Like what? It’s wearing masks socially distancing, sanitizing addition outside,

No. anti-lockdown anti-mask people. big Berlin rallies tens thousands, big spikes cases. People say must outdoors settings. Uh, think mean 4% mortality rate. Open book fucking sheep. course have. Look, mostly smack talking, come on, kernel truth here. hear plane getting diverted Europe drunken behavior, usually French person? someone UK? look cheap resorts around Europe alcohol flows freely - Ibiza, Sunny Beach etc ... overrepresented? age younger generations give far less sympathy go? think issues getting permission he’s longer president.

This I'd like see Presidential office dissolved (into 15 smaller offices, headed expert particular field) way OP; common citizen allowed something, President held similar regard (with exception certain extreme/urgent situations). Aye toilet roll panic buying begun lmao There’s pneumonia shot saw movie too. LOOOOOOL ok. Look photos protests. It’s damn close everyone wearing masks. Let’s see who’s laughing unemployment hits 20% it!

Oh wait... Incitement protest? moron. Hello muddah, hello fadduh.....  lose Senate McConell continues block legislation infuriate people likely cause demise entire party 2022. Ah thank insight. That's interesting. No, don't. That's scary part. going absolutely horrific situation come Thanksgiving.

To fair .. heard Brazil, India, countries *not* come true often has. anyone know compromise could children household go school coronavirus distancing measures, clinically vulnerable course it’s job, it’s option arrangement works everyone. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Wow. Well windows open holidays, air purifiers inside, heaters outside outside peeps. Ready go! Seriously! Let’s put math them: Masks Shelter Place. screwed didn’t mask hope SIP. It’s simple. happened mid-October cause thing go gangbusters western world? people collectively decide give start seeing friends/family again? ... ""need"" go shopping clothes? gotta wear shit holes pandemic ends? people protest wearing masks protest Handmaid's Tale level issue government tried push - forcing women bring term dead fetuses. :( extremely important cause precautions limit spread.

The government proganda use / already uses explain raise cases despite raise matching projections protests even started. I'd like believe knew downvote want, covid deniers! nearby siblings 

You ridiculous. think ""it society's job help children."" also believe someone's family member's job help childcare. 

You know genius, mom + dad work, I'm going guess aunt + uncle also work. Since concerned spreading COVID, I'm going guess want grandpa + grandma watch children.  That's said less contagious *or* less deadly. left MERS out, understand contagious, like 50-70% mortality rate, limiting large scale spread. spectrum initial comment SARS definitely deadly, falls ""less contagious"" part. We've pretty well last months, positivity rate steadily climbing since September 25th (from 2.51 3.77% today), hospitalizations followed.

7-day average cases nearing 800 again.

It's little concerning say least. describing way world works what? Yes know that's works. fucked like pandemic perfect example why, *completely* changeable people would get asses instead defending stopping it. Another one bites dust I'm missing big deal really. really “short time”? public health experts moving goalposts quite bit. No, forced labor slavery. care UN label is. forcefully make another human work slavery. apparent okay forced human labor. circumstances okay, literally slavery. It’s looking like common occurrence vaccine. Stay calm bro  Sort of, cases police breaking private homes neighbour believed might party tattled authorities. Sweden \~1% wore mask peak (2 months actual peak deaths) less people happy lean get packet milk whatever breathe neck. main benefit wearing mask people think \*you\* sick, look like 2 heads stay meters away. Chinese people rights. keep trains wonderful (I ridden - truly fabulous) trains enough. I've seen several sources, statements made experts eg. Germany Sweden exists. scroll bit. dunno optimistic pessimistic...... Plus Manufacturers certainly increase production know vaccine actually works, right producing risk. bad cold years ago whole lot symptoms covid. Bad cough weeks, loss smell, lung damage point use nebulizer months lung function took 2 years get mostly back normal. I'm really hoping close enough partial immunity. Definitely wasn’t ideal. considering Oregon seems state large metro area that’s handle virus, I’ll give pass. states lower deaths per million cases per million Vermont, Maine, Alaska Portland metro area population 2.5m alone twice big Maine 5x large Vermont. positivity rate “spiking” 6.9% quite big better it’s peers right now. 

Again probably great idea anyone’s earned right fun Halloween day work, it’s probably them. also edited post can't prove said one another. Cheers! Lock down? need miracle stage. state curse beautiful pandemic. everyone given up. friends age, thought progressive me, essentially nothing. Flying. Visiting families without masks. Going parties. feel like I’m going crazy. give too? Thats bit unreasonable key worker. do, bring kids work ward you? 

Quit look kids people die ward understaffed? 

Of course kids parents responsibility. European society 2 parents usually work support badly weighted social system favours old people triple locked pensions. Care systems fundamental part life - agree - commenting general population dog fight short sighted. 

Also key workers live couples imagine. Partners meeting hospital drawn together similar interests. 

Your initial post point, one certainly isn't. referring key workers here. work - well shit get done. need support care systems else can't work. Nope, spot on. Covid significantly contagious. Flu R number 1.3 season restrictions. 

Even measures still allow Covid spread exponentially significantly lower rate left fully unchecked say dropping R number 3 somewhere 1-2, reduce R number 1 flu make difficult really take off. course still clusters there, flu likely crushed places season whether succeed controlling covid not

Which well. combined major flu season major Covid surge would nightmare top God knows would fatality rate infected both. whom? flu season peaks around January February northern hemisphere. Hold hats. lot us going getting next months. Vaccine arrive soon enough help year. long spreading misinformation, like lot people sub seem do. cannot imagine ""just fun"", must reason it? According teenage reddit, ever rape. Means avoid seeing care going clinic visits medical examinations following advice refrain unnecessary visits large indoor public places, etc. 

Basically, keep distance others SEEK CARE HEALTH. many known unknowns unknown unknowns pandemic. also many topics nuanced, complex answers don’t fit 30 second sound bites. 

Some countries like Korea, Taiwan, New Zealand done amazing job. Others far right authoritarian regimes awful hundreds thousands dead citizens. thumbs fingers, fingers thumbs. slave forced laborers, forced laborers slaves.

As said, solid enough understanding topics discussing make conversation worthwhile. absolutely distinction whether understand not.

Time educate you. actually care all, read this, paper [came subject UN conventions defined status condition person powers attaching right ownership exercised” (UN Slavery Convention, art. much forced labor. slavery involves forced labor forced labor involves slavery. international prohibition slavery absolute; exceptions (as forced labor). 
Slavery institution slave master’s exercise rights ownership destroys human personality - person 
a bearer rights - reduces slave chattel, without rights. China well, despite media tries say African slaves? weren’t freed 1864? steaming pile crap take Pfizer, Moderna:👍👍👍.

That certainly accelerate fast get trial data. Testing started 7AM (some places delay 2 hours) test 10PM. tomorrow. 

In first 5hours (7AM - 12PM) tested 828 000+ people, 7947 positive. Results rest day announced tomorrow morning.   People going events like Sturgis trump rallys. good. Seeing small group occasions terrible thing. said flu contagious pre-symptomatic people ALL

That isn’t said ALL. 

Regardless, points stand they’re correct, you’ve generously helped prove. Thank you. think started 2016, need brush American history. life America. 

I relative stayed home children. husband divorced her. 60 years old retirement benefits. 

This issue normally affects WOMEN. Since (even 2020) women STILL primary caregiver children. stupid choice stay home children. risking financial future. willingly create world taking time work raise children

Raising children valued society, sadly. America even give women paid maternity leave. 

I children even did, still stay home them. seen first hand happen women work. refuse ever put situation. Aaaaand old people likely die, turning ‘family gatherings’ last time they’ll see other.


All people can’t comprehend bad idea. Going sad, sad winter. pediatrician tell send kids summer camp ""to help social development"" ""the virus threat kids, anyway."" public comply it? Yup. Summer camp essential service absolutely must provided, even viral pandemic. (big if) vaccine distribution done well, medical workers old people get first, knock mortality rate immensely even everyone gets it. FSU unresponsive put ventilator? may well case, especially people get flu shots. Southern Hemisphere sporadic flu cases really flu season all. latest CDC report October 24th shows little flu activity far 0.2% positive flu respects yes, pose certain questions GDP drop negligible even though many lower paid jobs shelved. One could say lot cases GDP TAX burden carried different demographic. 16 per cent Trump voters said would willing take vaccination Covid-19 one emerges, according poll, compared 71 per cent Biden voters.



Pathetic anti-vaxxers can't even accept dear leaders Warp Speed vaccine


But again, common sense wear masks attempt social distancing. willing crowd rallies dear leader.


Even dear leader caught it, spread administration. airlifted hospital several days, previously called hoax, 'just flu'. people's house medical staff couple dozen members hand. Lol no. I'm reading manipulated text. bible translated JND og texts scripts. memorized translated them. can't write anything vatican. used NLT KJV comments ease access butmy bible JND. best accurate translation. change original text. 
No back everything said
Jesus literally said God God him. 
Here go: 

John 10:30
I Father one.

1 Corinthians 8:6 
Yet us one God, Father, things exist, one Lord, Jesus Christ, things exist.

:) ""For Germany, breaking point could come December. France Switzerland might crack mid-November. Belgium could hit limit end week.""

Similar NL italy

amount IC hospital beds decreased steadily european countries years

even though overloaded every flu season

these politicians man, im tellin ya “just stay home two weeks” ever worked anywhere? appreciate theory opinion education lack thereof USA.

look president, even know word science means. Every European grew WW2: famously moron whose life lost forever. Valid point, I'm responding comment ""only Americans Reddit believing COVID eradicated"".

Anyway, really interest keeping date what's going China. think eyes Europe US point, things seem going control again. Well effectively cold kids. CDC's best estimate death rate 20 years old 1/33,333 people. said one 116 people got serious case. meme GTA San Andreas. There's particular difficult mission main character says ""Here go again."" retry. source even need

What more? You’ve provided zero. lmao Italy announce lockdown next week imho, got choice. We're \#1! We're \#1! assuredly teach things 5th grade 1st grade. think kids days can't even make change without calculator? 

I went Illinois Math Science Academy, one prestigious schools US. Standard, public education absolute joke. I'd guess 40% positivity rate means rate untested cases 10x. 1,400 tested cases that's 14,000 really. 750,000 people SD, today 5% population tested positive, real number probably least 20% range. math. Even 60% herd immunity threshold, can't 14,000 new cases day 20 days.  mean November January? would mean go way Argentina less somber way internal lockdowns, PPE mass production, border closures, testing capacity. Simple stuff, really. one’s life “on hold” lockdown, absolute fuckwit. ICU ones whose life hold. dude live city lmao think places subsiding computers though, lending school property. kids sitting home without access computer even phone video functioning that's crazy. get decent phone/tablets sub $50. Again, massive failure country kids access November. Now, someone help everyone totally separate issue. believe supposed damage done ""underlearning"" year pandemic can't fixed later life. one weird article posted poor citations OP deleted hours enough negative comments.  Temperature checks largely theater. need things provide physical separation. masks. vaccine flu readily available, get done goody two shoes butt sit front tv! wrong thinking corona-related measures make rate transmission flu way 1, causing flu dwindle small number cases? no, farting. germany best way hit +20k next week us family died causes pandemic don’t live state family. I’m visiting Dad deathbed, pandemic not. PERIOD. lmao bunch morons think thing made relieved strep knowing antibiotics kill it, studied extensively. 103 fever, able eat swallow sleep long killer. long, since new years eve opposite sex couples. avaliable sex couples years though. Grocery shopping pretty much normal, however one member household allowed per day one shopping trip. big grocery stores begun offering contactless click collect wanted it, wouldn’t say really impact busy stores were. Additionally, store open operate particular guidelines including density limit. 

People incentivised fines, guess? plus fact rest country basically eliminated it, closed community transmission 2-4 weeks. 

Lockdown sceptics arrested planned to/did protest otherwise break rules significant way. MSM very, anti lockdown. Luckily premier decided listen science rather media. idea how/where caught it? take serious, mask, distance, washing hands stuff like this? Trump mischaracterized poll though. said people prefer today's conditions 4 years ago, poll actually stated people felt better 4 years ago. Two different things, latter even reflective government. 

4 years long time, I'm better 4 years ago, nothing government policies User name consistent statement. 40%? Maybe live rural utah, seeing miles trump trains today, number seems way low. mistake. Lockdowns breed resentment. Since forced pay it, must slave. said slaves owned forced anything.

You going anything slave?

Should come free you? right mind would willing go NYC-vid- ccp morning grocery store like EVERYONE forgot social distancing. People didn’t care get it. They’re to. Hard. got quarter April lock stopped it, weeks without one 4000 far fetched. Yeah, no. aware Reddit major causal factor spread pizzagate helped create community went become Q members, pretty damn huge impact country. would make opposing argument.

Rather began rely educated cultural elevate much, academics concerned microagressions racial guilt improving society.

Academic spaces decades dedicated social justice rather academia.  Problem there's whole news network head state pushing people wear masks/social distance. stunted decrease could seen. Holdup dude, saying since probably solve plague 100% dumb? Like cooperative efforts improve situation may help, solve totally let's not. seem like kind person shower never really clean dirt 100%. Like bother, right? ""I idea got it! mean, go gym, nail salon, eat twice per week, visit 5 10 ""close friends"" every weekend! I've super safe!""  twice year Jesus people, they're trying help you. disagree. think Trump wishes could China did. Stop testing stop releasing numbers altogether. numbers look great. let's realistic. 

For instance, hypothetically could test every single American tomorrow. think number cases would go down? Reasonably, they'd skyrocket. But, also would make death rate plummet numbers nearly frightening news keeps reporting. 

I think fair assume many people tested confirmed it. positivity rate meaningless. hospitalization rate important shows true effects governments trying avoid. Sounds like hang around dumb people regardless party affiliation. already since couple weeks Yes thought early on. places won’t give pneumonia vaccine unless elderly preexisting condition. I’m 31 pneumonia 3 times, apparently that’s good enough reason. Melbourne took 111 days restrictive lockdown get new daily cases 700s almost none. US two months probably enough. vaccines never work. scientific fact. question whether vaccine work, well work, unbelievably complex extent team scientists size super computer reliably predict covid. Decreasing antibodies major factor vaccine effectiveness. question scientific qualification motivation anyone dismisses question hand, without solid evidence. precious little exists moment. Yep, doubtless kill off. unfortunately sizeable minority people care. see likely die catch it, ignore consequences like people losing jobs homes. 99% means 1 100 die. willingly poisoned town’s water supply 1% kill rate, would serial murderer. 

The president willingly allowing entire country subject 1% kill rate. real problem can't survive another lockdown, economy collapse. mean, want another strict lockdown, absolutely need it.

But without confiscating every single cent vatican AND/OR cutting every cent possible military spending, know survive winter without going bankrupt.

Also, COULD'VE KEPT SCHOOLS CLOSED OMG incredibly stupid, kinda worked first wave again? echoing Trump. Trump behind US polls Boris echoing Biden. ""special"" relationship... 

For special read retarded. vaccines? Seriously, they? fuck? Thank god. Stay safe sir!  least number cases setting daily record. Still bad numbers though, particularly hospitalizations. shops open public supermarkets pharmacies. Majority others, like Kmart Target, allowed click-and-collect. Hardware stores open tradies, public click-and-collect. essential businesses, like factories, food processing plants, etc., allowed continue normal, face masks staff, Covid-safe measures.

The Vic government put huge fines breaches (up $5,000), little discretion.

There massive amount skepicism, protests managed draw maybe 40 people tops, easily managed police. people talking shit Facebook/Reddit. people positively comparing European country US, that’s way it’s done. 

Agree though - comparison granular cases. Well pedantic. Happy Halloween ya jerk. hope guys follow man anymore says go away waiting lot people unnecessarily die tons projected mindblowing far pandemic.

It also becomes longer lockdown, get thing trying avoid. well. friends got it. 100% week later. 

No clue “long term symptoms” people keep yapping Haha, seriously believe BS.

That's said last time, ""2 weeks slow spread"" ass, shit turned 3 months PA. point exact entire time. one keeps trying get move goal posts dude. Remember said death could force people work? going amend definition? keep arguing multiple contradictory points?

You one incredibly offensive using racial slurs telling people actually freed slaves forced laborers *personally* slave owners ashamed use definitions words rest entire world?

But think problem?

Ok. vote it. 

The problem say matter Ok, goes. police sheriff's deputies would classified law enforcement. general explanation, plenty places slightly different rules.

First thing would search ""El Paso County, TX"" Google Maps, followed ""El Paso, TX"". would notice El Paso County larger ""El Paso"". Sheriffs elected entire county, deputies enforce laws anywhere county. term ""police"" normally used refer specific city/town's (also referred municipalities) department. example, City El Paso Police can't enforce laws Vinton, Texas. Police chiefs normally elected appointed either mayor city council. 

Sheriffs power places smaller municipalities since cover higher percentage overall territory normally would. Probably get assumption. friend age (30) hospitalized nearly died. Extremely rough condition. can’t predict viruses outcome single person. Exposure could kill may nothing me. Isn’t called participation trophy? "" One protesters, Greg Karl Heber, said ... “The reason engage, return phone calls emails nothing. She’s public official. responsibility answer questions.” ""

Oh look, one freeman land type guys. guys believe need follow laws consented follow. also like stop using names invent new names someone dares put legal trouble, go saying person judge/police/ect uses there. Fun people, oh like guns. ? Unless enforced police arrests wont work. oh misunderstood meant that. yeah, coming sure people going though?
Crowd beaches mid november? 

Sit closed beer gardens? 

Or throw house party catch 10k fine wasnt place last time? hope. STILL aren’t even shutting bars restaurants! They’re telling everyone bad careful, everything still running. driving around yesterday shocked many places indoor dining open Northern Utah. Sounds like need hire another health care provider. forgot ""globalist"" Winter lock-down best lockdown. Melbourne, reckon would've struggled compliance it'd nice sunny days whole time. Staying home winter much stretch. Many fellow Americans know asses holes ground either. People WANT care. want keep living lives pretending OK. 

Here rough, unvarnished truth. Masks worst thing happen us. No, work oh difficult tolerate; problem masks enable much normalcy. real way break back pandemic distance. 

If country dumb weak would endure proper distancing would demand it. Alas, Americans ain't shit. way oversimplified view. Way way way simplified. simply wrong many cases. must work family-owned restaurant, then. Awe, thick skins around here. Hey Boris, hugz! ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)  Isnt spread theorized asymptomatic carriers? sure would work Nothing wrong them. possibility many may pop stupidity weekend what’s wrong all. family locked Spain, left house likely find armed officer asking going. hour exercise, went food medicine. Fines spot, four figures.

Friend Cyprus text get permission leave house, reply would time allowed police would stop check permission.

In France written explanation journey, place new lockdown.

I saw #cancelthecurfew trending UK places serving alcohol wanted early closing ended. That's *not* curfew. Spain currently 11pm-6am curfew. Belgium 10pm curfew. mean pub shuts, means streets. says using fast &amp; slow development methods. slow ones likely work. Seems reasonable, fast ones likely work, one would use slow methods. kind makes sense 41 states don’t meet criteria, including New York many surrounding states well couple months ago. new testing method theory effective (it stop covid positive people coming NY first place), people actually follow rules (which problem old system well) Fauci watching back. wonder independent scientists getting paycheck Trump's feds say. apply job CDC. I’m small landlady, it’s two unit home live upstairs rent first floor apartment.

Haha, sorry sarcastic. know (and lots people) rely rent actually afford home/bills variety reasons. sympathize position, hope works end! American, Im total disagreement there, really 30-40% whiny baby territory. voting certain way next week. business people really care excess deaths caused Corona... use excuse stay open. Lol. hilarious absolutely lot documented early. Showing ignorance debating fact. think everyone recatch thousands magically overwhelmed pandemic healthcare entities identify report? know anything works?? way hanging outdoors presently. I’m wearing mask instance. need break I’m taking it. Fuck world fuck corona. withholding patients?   genuinely trying pull '""gotcha"" moment I'm playing game. slaves go check on? posit anonymous nature Reddit it’s structure message board makes impactful whereas social media platforms feature statements actual individuals endorse irl.

Like idea u/nythro does, don’t think u/nythro I’m entertaining Reddit, way think u/normalcoolguy.

It’s like college classroom debate website extension user.

I believe anonymous nature site makes ore game entertainment platform social media sites like Twitter Facebook.

Take argument example. Literally nobody cares two users saying. We’re bored. broken leg I’m sitting around reasons. none matters.

If post something controversial Twitter, however, could get fired. There’s significant difference. Hi Boris. Hi redneck. Fancy Brexit? yous ones voting president isn’t even lucid Australian key differences:

* Australia locked single city well geographically isolated. 

* Australia shares borders countries, unlike UK channel tunnel, cannot feasibly shit down. 

* Australia suppress virus among 5 million people, UK needs 67 million people. I'm Houston/Harris County several drive-thru testing centers. tried get tested month.

You see lines...

NO LINES think people honestly would rather know. Sad.

(There literally waiting ... give cell phone number name, address, etc. text test results code, get tested. Literally took 10 minutes ... hardest part driving maze cones get testing booth) Good thing Germany basically moist towelette months October March. Come something mean hey job prob paid well risks come paid scale /s anyone explain year feels long? usually worry fast time gone point year reflect New Year’s Day feels like last week year feels like eternity. I’m sure it’s Corona business. C’mon redditors, blow mind truth nugs. long restrictive lockdown achieve. possible control virus there. We’ve political leadership, active police enforcement rules population supports measures. Thank much Melbournian friends taking one team keeping rest us safe.  attack. plan setup global revolution trigger ww3. succeed. Burn TV. Horrible depressing. get vitamin levels ok. Bojo discipline Cummings. Cummings disciplines Bojo. attack. plan setup global revolution trigger ww3. succeed. Burn TV. arnt rights Australia, read constitution, dont bill rights attack. plan setup global revolution trigger ww3. succeed. Burn TV. nobody complaining, Italy fucking wars inside cities can't go 7 hours (which btw 5 spend sleeping times)... live beautiful country idiots live 97,000 new cases reported nothing ability confirm new cases better available testing... Lol. logical. attack. plan setup global revolution trigger ww3. succeed. Burn TV. It’s also irrational, placeholder fundamentalist religious types get services feeling Lord.

It’s delusion brain engaging also partly placed conmen/women. 

I don’t care want feel energy crystals, acme naïveté claim many crystals aren’t pushed healing whatever pseudo-scientific bs use. second lockdown happen earlier third lockdown would happen later? true people give settle herd immunity option. Boris Johnson bent backwards avoid anything would upset vocal people. confident would rather saw leg eat restrict people's Christmases extent scientifically advised. Dead people cant complain able go thier favorite place breakfast, course lock right move.

People dont want face face may need sacrifices something herd. hope not. Lockdowns kill. Noone enforcing still ~90-95% compliance honestly good I'd expect. ...Eventually. best kick months Come on, could seen coming since start month. person Boris. gradually increasing regional restrictions hint. that's charitable. Why? why?

Can't everyone see lockdowns keep bringing back exact result? lockdown 4 weeks open cases rise lockdown again.

This nuts, anyone asked elderly want this? want isolated?? IFR getting lower lower mean maybe overreacting.

And probably business survived first lockdown survive one.

But probably everyone sub masturbating kind news that's narrative love. Please don’t make assumptions me. dad small-time family farmer gotten little 4-digit yearly net income bad years. Blue collar people soft spot heart came from. hindsight see condescending words were.

Look reply someone else, feel bad. Chalk dumb 21 yr old. Hope goes well future. Mental disability great excuse understand. Eating frozen domestos ice cubes makes covid symptons go away “Mask Jail” motto. deep end...  use logic occam's razor better 

know limits god? organized religion bible itself, stupid rules senseless, etc.  Exactly. People keep saying lockdowns kill economy ways, does. letting pandemic run course probably worse. There's reason countries high death rates performed worse, economically. That's right, contact tracing Melbourne exactly best reason nominate current success. due harsher instructions followed we're functioning society. It’s impossible kids catch spear virus emerging understanding resistant it, don’t spread easily, don’t show many symptoms, schools significant source contagions. 

They immune, mind you. put restrictive measures table weight benefit get costs socially, politically economically. Masks instance easy order make rules simple restriction minimal benefits immense. 

Closing schools hand often means least one parents unable work (even home tell experience it’s nigh impossible) people left without alternatives government response often inadequate support people situation. benefits get harsh measure particularly great. enforcement. School still open. mandatory masks. pointless lockdown be. Schools, uks no1 babysitting service. parents continue work asda economy keep going line pockets powerful.. wearing masks regardless pandemic Why? new rules can't meet 6 people outside, one. Gyms movie theatres closing, pubs restaurants. old rules. 

This nothing. We'll come December spike virus going vanish.  Sure. That's Australia went lockdown. Federal government provided Job Keeper payments keep people positions lockdown occurred hope lifted, businesses would ready start again.

There businesses made fact businesses would suffered people patronising shops want get, pass virus.

As result, nationwide we've ~850 deaths. last state eradicate virus come lock week and, bar restrictions, things heading back normal hopefully cases on.

I guess nation chosen whether puts lives economies first. I'm glad Australia put lives first aware yet see full economic ramifications lockdown.  People need stop peddling count.

You may able get back 0, could heavily reduce cases thing. planning covid genocide even then, proof conspiracy theorists covid planned make population easier overlords control us. Lots decisions made part basis tourism. Hence travel corridors start. 

Sturgeon telling people visit England vice versa unless essential reasons. 

Wales closing border reasons too. Coming , sure, freezing though. wouldn’t surprised I’m little confused: actual leaked data missing? track daily hospitalizations via data wrong? Hard tell article media opposition huge problem. trust media totally gone I’ve lost respect LNP. said everywhere, isn't. Sure active cases, I'm following recent outbreak kashgar. Also many imported cases daily, running rampant going unreported on, no. different counties different guidelines? Yeah, mindblowing

Trust me, I’m jazzed either, dude. holy fuck, sub 2 million people there’s going different points view you’ll see. That’s inevitable. ‘t’ stands time save electricity! statement based purely anecdotal evidence. haven’t heard government consultations risk populations though shutting everything Please take note use word ""reported"". think main factors distance duration exposure. wear mask everywhere try really aware people around keep moving. probably well 100 million cases least US point. virus securely seeded literally everywhere. Contact tracing almost impossible point.... least shouldve done ""fired"" month two slowly let back.

The fact shit-ass excuses came absurd one really respect lockdown.

You set example top Alright mate. fun that. Bed me.  Question. Doesn’t fill rage? People going away forever assholes. existential gets. *vast majority businesses needed *demonstrably *will help millions need mask walking street?

The outdoors world's best ventilation system... Would wave less intense since sucked summer too? Yep, tried word carefully exactly right. simply stating thoughts situation, understand would better staying brain. feel like total asshole hindsight. Terrorists taking notes: would thought biological warfare would easy?  Hanging quiet desperation English way...

and yall get chance prove it! Best luck that... awful teachers well, even students PGCE similar placements. Someone contact infected, test positive.

Or, didn’t get tested all. economy countries never got virus control better ours. Lives health linked economy. It’s realistic think business would booming thousands sick dying. Definitely not. It’s pretty cut dry. selfless times live in. greater good vulnerable society. Stiff upper lip time boys. strange, he's moron, thats pretty common solution? thinking top head. keep kids home month? probably Birx I'd say three. stew sealed hazmat suites full respirators. I’ll chip pay them. Flu season UK December March, we've 3 months year, one wearing masks March. 

Covid cases rising deaths growing rate.



The tories destroyed north before, gladly rest country line pockets. It'll miracle country built mass frenzied anxious consumers dry humping American dream, result, one step back long enough appreciate business essential part society, standard living hampered pandemic poors They're saying North high numbers, say suffer lockdown regionally.


It's affects London surrounding areas Boris decides national problem. real data numbers ? JobSeeker (i.e. unemployment benefits) $1000+/fortnight everyone country time. think around $800 now. burden proof claim maker. Sounds ""essential"", go it. 
I mean first thought school weren’t responsible majority positive cases. cited government surgery showing responsible 45% positive cases. 

Then said deaths 20,000. It’s actually 50,000. also flu season actually starts. 

More testing = positives, explain deaths increased exponentially year. “provisional death registration data England Wales September 2020 shows 39,827 deaths registered England, 2,568 deaths five-year average September; Wales, 2,610 deaths registered, 135 deaths five-year average.”


I’m starting think maybe don’t facts here? Maybe need read news bit more? Actually look reasoning behind things. Yep everyone last night rushing get public transportation would closed down. Poor planning state. also see cases stabilize 2 weeks rise weeks leading Christmas think .03% chance demographic ok. Bojo hanging Cummings dry end Bogo leaving dry country realises much depends Cummings still get online, worst case imaginary scenario, would get education one year, would resume, what? India medical field. know even rural area doctor tasked daily testing covid go home hotels. one people crafting lock messaging.

He symptoms travelled somewhere.. period even took drive Barnard Castle claims unsure eye sight wanted test (I think like 40 miles)

That's sort it.. might fuzzy details eye sight trip 100% correct  North East well, people mindful wearing mask minority like first month initial lockdown, there's little enforcement, even public transport meant mandatory. I'm really hoping maybe people start take seriously I'm optimistic :/ Well, anti-mask/anti-vaccine/anti-lockdown parade going south-east london today.

COVID-19 virulent force affecting country thanks ease spreading misinformation American imports Twitter Facebook. true. children primary secondary primary it’s impossible help children understand can’t secondary it’s impossible get actually know do. 

But. 

It’s simple. nationwide lockdown school children bringing home COVID-19, mainly infect siblings parents, thirties forties. key bringing number occupied beds NHS minimise many elderly people infected. nationwide lockdown help that, children grandchildren stay away them.

Buckle folks. going rough one consider major accomplishment 100,000 cases/day. shit sherlock I'm still driving 450 miles see dad Thanksgiving. us go shop (and sometimes, deliveries too) think huge risk around one self-isolating person.

Cough every single article mail USPS ships everyone forces ""herd mentality""?

It's bad quite literally *nothing* would solved issues far better his, uh, ""handling"" thus far. There's guarantee he'll step peacefully. You’re totally right, Reddit (generally, course everyone) loves play doomsday role knew along bad something was/is going be. they’re wrong, that’s good thing, they’re right get feel superior anyone dumber them.

Especially subreddit dedicated pandemic. positivity rates midwest ***insane***. There's way many states 20%. still know 1 person ever got way back June  like people anything different 

the people wear masks still go work normal work shit. involves close others going quit?  Worldometers higher? people fine, yes, all. ""Oh die, stop worrying it"" mentality shows much ass people are. Close 3% population documented covid now. exponential growth start using % americans sick % americans dead now. Unreal. Yet still seeing people posting going Halloween parties social media.

Idaho:

This data speaks volumes citizens Idaho believe believe.  forget Karen ✔️ Anyone know location? Yeah, crazy hit 100k without NY California surge Don’t infringe religious freedom spread virus! Rounding curve spiral drain... also wears PM2.5 mask dual vents speaking press.

that’s dumb is. Lag time infections deaths. Also doctors getting better treating Covid patients. I've replacing ""effed up"" since March. way around time God hate state Let’s lean collective trauma. write Covid comic series? Covid superhero? Plus, single day trend. 

Connecticut also 2.5% days ago.

I've got family there, genuinely hope continues drop - I'm celebrating quite yet. individual who's comment saw yesterday saying predicted 100,000 week Marylander reporting in, states pretty lockstep beginning sadly we're still lockstep anything too. covid like ""lol that's cute""  infection rate correlate mortality currently? testing more, rate go finding perhaps mild cards well? Similarly, makeshift morgue trucks like NY beginning? know election season, coverage may getting missed. way taste we’ll face climate change? don’t doubt you, I’m failing see parallels. We're rounding corner upwards direction.

This winter really gonna suck. USA USA USA WOOOOOO France/Italy/Spain/UK/Belgium/Poland/Czechia/Netherlands = \~320mil pop, 200k new cases influenza also coronavirus? Argentina, Peru, Colombia, Bolivia ivermectin prophylactic regimen covid-positives since May. go-to hospitals. Why? doctor Dominican Republic touted cure. 

Do links that? seem actively hostile toward ivermectin; I'm going believe without Look infection death rate countries. rank amongst highest South America.

Are putting forward theory ivermectin **increases** fatalities?

I'm somewhat informed Peru. @jjchamie (on twitter) followed Peru - ivermectin story closely. think difficult, making solid inferences country-level data, he's compared various locales thinks ivermectin helpful. Would like link paper that? posted /r/ivermectin yet dig interested.  Tbh you’re different Europe. us tired hearing coronavirus, nobody - even elderly - takes seriously anymore. 

I understand why; median age death COVID-19 82 live 2+ co-morbidities. It’s hard outside category people understand lockdown. here. y'all get exponential growth America First!

(with infections) ""I wonder came from!"" Yes, it’s like Atlanta too. live Buckhead, main shopping fancy dining district Atlanta, lately every Friday Saturday evening looks feels like normal weekend evening. Hell, even regular ole week nights started feel like virus hit. Malls packed barely open parking spaces. Restaurants slammed inside out. Many people aren’t wearing masks properly, all. It’s wild. 


Our governor thinks Covid-19 regulations like masks social distancing enforced people smart enough make right decision. Well, truth people smart enough, businesses don’t give fuck. almost certainly deadly Great Leap Forward 1971 Bangladeshi War Independence

Fair point, bit Nato-centric thinking. Weekend cases usually dip bit, graphs look noisy makes blood boil. condolences, grandfather passed recently. hurts, wish anyone. empires collapse eventually. say hindsight 20/20 something we're past million infections day, path toward herd immunity spring... surprising all. witnessed months inaction leadership half country opened bare minimum restrictions. Many people refuse wear masks attend super spreader events regularly. leaders declaring pandemic surging greater heights. 

Now virus spread exponentially almost every corner America scientists disregarded ever. We're screwed, plain simple. We'll get vaccine, yes, take time distribute. 'handling' pandemic historically bad. silver lining this, it'll speed phase 3 vaccine trials. Let's hope get vaccine sooner rather later. Europe marginally better moment. diminish astounding job America done spreading virus. denial baseless optimism greatest threats survival. Absence evidence isn’t evidence absence. still conclusive test prove it. know subsequent infections worse first. Considering career bodybuilder Charles Atlas way back when, surprised. interesting see history books portray White House claiming great accomplishment term office “defeating pandemic”...even hit new daily all-time highs numbers new cases.

Will students able see President delusional seeing? going winter death hardship like seen since WW2 Northern Hemisphere.

At risk *that* guy, almost certainly deadly Great Leap Forward 1971 Bangladeshi War Independence.

But almost certainly suffering disruption US Western Europe experienced within living memory vast majority populations. Lol, got downvote asking question.

welcome reddit FUCKIN CUCKS SUCK DICK may resolved vaccine available. Hell may even require yearly vaccine said done. virus goes similar fashion Russian Flu, would people really bother vaccinated common cold? see people looking vaccine ultimate end. I'm saying taken seriously think hiding better.  LIKE WINNING WORLD SERIES COVID Pls kill It’s almost rounding corner downward spiral. Don’t guns jerk to? sorry hear this. hang there, alone. That's US structured.  surge 2000 deaths day like Europe author decided stop updating it. Last update October 5. Take that, Melbourne: locked months end, party roaring!  I’m Nashua, New Hampshire city 90 k . whole state 500 deaths I’m pretty sure best country infection rates. even see many ppl about, parties, masked anything. weird there’s numbers Argentina, Peru, Colombia, Bolivia ivermectin prophylactic regimen covid-positives since May. go-to hospitals.

Come on, MBA supposedly, can't read chart? mask mandate live months. part I’m looks like usage pretty close 100% cases spiking big time. said done Trump pulled off. right election too, really turn voters' heads. are, thankfully. Thanks asking! they’re paramedics Doctors. since father 74, don’t let anywhere near premises. They’re administrative/fundraising side. 

People usually go clinic symptoms, people need symptoms get test. understand biggest problem they’ve people stay home don’t go Dr. it’s late. Keep mind Mexico second highest obesity world, there’s lots diabetes hypertension, sadly. 

I know there’s parts country meds starting scarce, far appears ok hometown. 

People also using Anaferon protect virus. many people fucking hurry get sick‽ USA NUMBER 1  wade Tegnell absolutely expect Sweden reach ""herd immunity"" fairly quickly result strategy. May, antibody results fell disappointingly short he'd expected, stopped talked about.

April now, country’s chief epidemiologist said strategy appears working “herd immunity” could reached capital Stockholm matter “In major parts Sweden, around Stockholm, reached plateau (in new cases) we’re already seeing effect herd immunity weeks’ time we’ll see even effects that. rest country, situation stable,” Dr. Anders Tegnell, chief epidemiologist Sweden’s Public Health Agency, told CNBC Tegnell said sampling modeling data indicated 20% Stockholm’s population already immune virus, “in weeks’ time might reach herd immunity believe we’re seeing slow decline cases, spite sampling (testing coronavirus) more.”  I’m masked outdoor event local big cat sanctuary Halloween; pandemic friendly activity could find. Please take care people; we’re dark time ahead US saying “I told so” hurt though? accountability? consequences grotesquely unnecessary avoidable loss? hit numbers mid November, easy. 6 day doubling time current administration publicly stated they’ve completely given control.

The UK said today already passed point would led projected worst case scenario. Stonks That’s suspect. cases start spike, places start shut down. Even USA, El Paso defied governor’s orders issued stay home order. Screw nonsense, focus really important: anyone know truck/van battle wagon bible thumping gun toting fool in? thing looks bad ass! overreach. exactly county judge for. chief executive officer county. completely within purview. Can’t wait go Iowa school 2800 cases worldometers higher now? spring number Illinois always matched official number state. worldometers higher days. heard hiding Pluto. Idaho’s Saul Goodman ?  35% (Czech Republic)  person city. supposed go virtual county hit orange level. hit orange, instead going virtual sent everyone back. red still person. 

Contact tracing isn’t happening one next someone else 10 minutes time. 

Admin trying pressure many students back person possible help attendance. 

I’ve many explosive arguments year admin/board members. Everyone always said Germany copies America... Anybody else feeling nauseous? I'd love see permanent changes - decentralised workforce remote working means everyone live city, turn improves economies opportunities smaller satellite towns. people enjoy less citified life room less competition urban housing parking positive want stay city. 


Basically opportunity provide way people viable options live work. necessarily believe happen, would like to. Social limiting.

You limit time spent people well. Sounds like need severely defunded. Good riddance No, spreading disinformation thats debunked. comorbidities listed 94% symptoms resulted virus. think people walking around underlying case respiratory failure, obvious wrong. best forcasting model inverse whatever Trump says rallies. They're literally saying elderly infirm deserve die weakness. literal death cult. US first country break 6 digits? America First? believe shirk personal responsibility lieu pUHrSuHnUhL LiBerTeeZ. MUH FACE FREEDUHM!! USA back #1 baby! (In covid-19 cases)  people who's work requires negative test come quarantine exposure, nursing home residents tested weekly, hospital staff tested regularly, college athletes, pro athletes tested daily, etc etc etc Yea either way response piss poor. Yea maybe big guy got hot potato thrown hands....him throwing onto people pointing finger right response ""leader"". ""Calm down. Go take walk. forget mask."" 

You sound like compensating snowflake type ngl Sadly last time US hits daily record. Lol Like said, stop watching state sponsored news read real news. Russia hoax shit almost crazy QAnoners. liberal version lock up. God forbid take accountability actions. plenty articles manufactured nonsense. Read intercept real investigative journalism.

We get Russians made memes Facebook. correlate handling coronavirus fascist government. Human immune systems *very* good fighting viruses. vaccine synthesizer inside that's constantly learning adapting new threats. Best thing stay home support body counteroffensive.  Also it’s virus killing people. It’s someone voluntarily killing. think people get that. Well community seeing regular spikes following multiple Trump rallies calling COVID hoax problem many people thinking everybody’s problem symptoms, went check tonsillitis. pretty weird thing happy still feel horrible. Fake news. know anyone died it. said sister died know better, they're lying. Trump said best world. CNN covid nuisance network trying breed fear people control them. /s. Calm down. Ah Pennsyltucky  I’d say everyone masking good thing! wish mine would could actually see them. mask mandate enforced? Picture believe “anti-masker” ask person gives crap “national mandate.” much winning. *sigh* Elon Musk said would March? telling Musk wrong??? wanna listen “Music head ballet” bonzos final moments it’s great ending song Wait til hear tomorrow Stock check total testing. per capita testing countries equal US would closer 7% Fuck neanderthal simplicity People it, local authorities enforce en masse. would suggestion mandate. guy gets  corner we're turning upswing growth graph... delusions grandeur next years they’ll raking cash. clue hell happened him. There’s anti-maskers office used literally yell people wearing masks. he’s asking hang BIL try catch it. real sad consider that's fairly well compared enough blowtorches, China show US things really get done.  Basically copy whatever fuck Taiwan did... unless late already many cases. recluse 8 months extreme 

You talking redditors. hermit friendless losers never leave momma's house turned virtue overnight they're gonna make sure shove face every time get. 101,000 cases... Right right, many people say ‘in itself’ instead something like ‘alone’, instance. I’ve decided way know ask time see it. that’s I’m doing.  champions? insanity! That’s funny wildly scary. wonder long US government starts making illegal report new COVId cases Man, must think you’re sooo correct say someone lost loved one. make sick.

The flu temporally stable illness. COVID goes exponentially. flu goes exponentially, use heartless equivalence.  Love idea. &lt;3 even conspiracy Russia taking active measures destabilize US. easiest defeat opponent convince defeat themselves. That's practical people. better stay home? What's prize Well country test lot would #'s go down? Working celebrated eating candy. Decorating carving pumpkin suppose clarify. occasion partner go stores needed. one couple also WFH distancing visit homes.

But beyond that, city, everywhere go people wearing masks. distancing. Throwing house parties. Crammed shoulder shoulder, maskless, restaurant patios. No, don’t agree I’m excessive go places. know videos people screaming throwing shit grocery store employees asked wear mask? MANY coming state. There’s reason COVID thriving one point worst US. partners offices opened absolutely need place go, like every fourth desk open, mask worn whole time, kitchen closed, etc etc. really point going since home offices. family members either distancing (and traveling) working high contact jobs grocery stores hospitals. both-I family members one literally treating COVID patients partner can’t bothered keep mask he’s store. exactly would go? Yeah, I’m pissed 8 months much community isn’t even bare minimum actively acting it’s hoax overly reckless. everyone wearing mask let kids reach bowls hand candy fine. We're putting individual paper bags front porch. Let's get hysterical outdoor, socially distant activity. fuck people wearing masks, HALLOWEEN, HARD WEAR MASK PICK SPOOKY ONE LIKE SCREAM glad White House listed ending Covid-19 pandemic achievement. Nothing see here.

*georgewbushmissionaccomplished.jpg* became completely politicized nearly half country decided wearing mask unpatriotic. I’ve working home since first week March. I’ve studied virology although I’ve shifted career slightly diff direction, it’s slap face parents tell think it’s “silly” we’re mandated wear masks wh ever go...

With mind, I’d lying I’d say haven’t avoiding “holiday plans” convo w mom. Ideally, I’d able tell I’m planning meet thanksgiving whatever (I’ll happily connect w via zoom not), know it’s going backfire somehow, I’m going “one” didn’t see fam year. I'm sick winning. took current number COVID patients number staffed beds reported American Hospital association. 

[Staffed patients r/theydidthemath probably better sub it. Trump loves say cases test more. release amount tests taken well positive cases? possible show even increased testing still overall cases? don’t live fear, life risk everywhere go. America grandma's debit card reading properly died tried running again. Come find using chip reader properly first thats working. positive side got inheritance money I've decided set aside future hospital bills. Halloween going result
T big spike Last milestone 330 million Fuck scare tactics 
99 percent survivor rate way. Takes 2 shots approx 21 days apart. 
It took 3 weeks get appointment drive thru flu shot. Imagine millions people trying get shots. 
I'm sure select get March take long get 600 million shots March seems insane. 
Also, research pointing towards limited duration post infection immunity. That's going throw huge wrench plan. 
The vaccine going silver bullet beat thing. huge help masks, social distancing, contact tracing, quarantine going us long time...  Kind Jesus dude shut up. We've blaming Russia fuckups like hundred years get program. Stop watching MSNBC CNN read real news. I’d surprised it’s low, honestly. Hospital ICUs across country already nearing capacity. New York high death rate dude max capacity able allocate resources. Can’t allocate everywhere once. rapid increase places even Florida acted, South Florida went strict orders Baseless comment. won’t. won’t. Nope. Covid Lung% glitchless speedrun indoors? Like hide candy behind couch pillow plant pot contrary case loses power. reason Senate Republicans consider stimulus package election. lose want give Biden worst possible start better chance retaking control 2024 Nah it’s valid point you’re emphasizing North America. don’t think we’ve seen much loss since WW2. playing: [Music Head Ballet (2007 losers, infections per capita countries Europe almost million every day now! Git gud! Yea...we used that...... whiners took over! that's deaths per capita (see heading left) sure calculate since first wave US bigger, perhaps second wave canada would bigger well schools, simply told weeks outbreaks occurred. Wear mask use hand sanitizer wash hands. US peak around country currently morgue-truck rates, relatively soon virtually nothing done slow spread, currently occurring. Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas, election riots happen. party getting started one Pennsylvania gives fuck virus nobody idk talk spraying everything alcohol, sounds like people gullible *Alexa play “Music head ballet” bonzo dog band*  They’re failure they’re total complete denial

We never chance fail never fucking tried first place. 

Saying we’re rounding corner we’re posting 100K+ infections day 2+2=5 Orwellian level insanity

And fact 40% Americans seemingly OK soul crushing.

The fuck happened country 4 years... 5% less shooting 

7 bad many countries, could lot worse better dress zombies prepare day it'll disappear...just like miracle... China great probably attempted initially suppress truth fail allow access ground zero still chance stopping virus. Zinc supplementation also. Cheap well known antiviral properties. I'm saying cure- hurt.  wump retain 1% death rate that's 970 deaths potentially one day. Calculated risk keyword. almost magically complex devices hand. Talking shit across world science know nothin. see America continuing ""win"" set records.

How leadership go shit quickly Obama? horrible upcoming winter.

Damn dude, listen yourself. horrible thing wish upon anybody.  We're #1! retarded??

 CDC [has IFR values Covid-19 age-specific estimates, low 0.003% 0–19 years, 0.02% 20–49 years, 0.5% 50–69 years, 5.4% 70+ years. sister tried mom. lift her, mom really try work dementia. Almost put sister hospital. live fear? Otherwise fine playing Russian Roulette. course Democrat lead states It’s almost like enveloped viruses, along Hep C HIV bunch viruses, “similar appearance” means less nothing. prefer Kushner defines waves. first panic. second pain. third recovery. 



He says we’re third now. Feels good man. True. I'm always conflicted whenever argument comes up. Like yes Russia fueled fire... definitely fire begin with. tough call. said, definiy fuel fire via social media etc. God, can’t imagine must like delusional... live public safety measures actually think worst case scenario needs happen maybe learn something future. get Covid won’t something stupid it’ll fucking idiots life really don’t control over. It’s inevitable point unfortunately S. Korea could like New Zealand Taiwan government lifted restrictions soon people behaved recklessly are.

100 cases day seems low still bug us. Personally know anyone infected, still careful. Herd immunity doesn’t work without vaccine. doesn’t even exist.

The whole concept vaccinate around 90% population more, remaining 10% less unable medical religious reasons. 

Finally, sacrifice people, survivors don’t even get immunity longer couple months, 115 days longest period time IgG class antibodies still found samples patients, October 8. much population vaccinated, virus can’t spread easily 9/10 times transmitted person fights without even realising don’t pass on.

When one vaccinated, isn’t herd immunity. You’re killing thousands people giving even chronic health issues.

Survival fittest also doesn’t apply healthy doesn’t give automatic survival pass, makes likely. Yeah every time mention another lockdown business shut people downvote shit you. seems even people hardcore slow spread earlier giving up. It’s bullshit. dunno happened sub seems everyone gotten cranky wants give up. It’s frustrating fuck every time mention actually taking action people/the bots/trolls come droves. called anti intellectualism powered two partisan political system radicalizes individual, social economic ideas dangerous trends productive short long term.

But yeah whatever lets blame rest world. SARS-1 also mutated rapidly basically dead-ended itself. Definite luck involved top symptom timeliness easier trap. hero Yeah did... 101,461 Faith fear, right?? Lol Yeah, I'm thinking. Even hit 200,000 day, collective conscious never gonna panicked. Even people know took seriously numb. Still taking seriously, like, talking vocal it. something we've come accept many gonna fail at. 100,000 new cases COVID-19 every day? 

Ha. wish all. Back March, week without school shooting. First time since 2002. Fuck Yeah! nothings gonna change Well it’s like main source information going explain it. Fox News really destroying country. lockdown flips going work. two minimum things face mask mandate mass testing, that's absolute minimum solve crisis. two things stop it, credible vaccine(s) herd immunity. vaccine take time develop, meantime must aim herd immunity, means build hospital beds, hire nurses, make supplies, mass testing. politicians heard say want spend billions build infrastructure, waiting? blind, SEEN ONE politician advocate agendas. possibly UK Well mean fewer necessarily worse, good thing really, kind macabre way go getting there. Deaths per capita America 27% higher france, probably not.

Positivity rate we're discussing people getting tested, nation whole. major theme next 20 years truth won’t fixed treat information claim justification provided (within reason). we're going, need roads. Yes, did. also featured John Ossoff utterly destroying David Perdue last Georgia senate debate (though time known Perdue going make like namesake chicken out). covered wide range things election people US. well, created it... necessary start hoarding though? people overreacted panick buying people think basically harmless, dont see us shutting way again. course, election could change things It’s true. surrounded them, always been. Don’t worry though, they’ll pull working-class like always have... day now... think it’s useful smaller populations like cities. Take philadelphia example. month ago percent positivity around 3.5%. doubled. Testing increased bit past month all, factors remained pretty much same. really seeing resurgence. scale large country means less. it’s amazing- right followed science early worked. 

Look countries like Vietnam Thailand Japan S. Korea .... countries small islands. people masked start. Social distanced. Listen heath officials. anti-science BS. someone tested positive, isolated hospitalized even mild symptoms. sent home pain killers haha! 

Even US small island nation.... anti-maskers science-deniers... still explosion cases deaths.... in-laws: get it, coming Thanksgiving?! friends posting Facebook family none posted getting COVID!

At point see many people caved FOMO, 100k new (diagnosed) cases every day. seems right. everything seems back normal live...as traffic back pre-corona levels. schools seem person( pass 6 schools way to&amp;from work.) workplace big meetings person though still online option sometimes. seeing nearly many masks stores. Guess people think over? source cities, bundle decent H $25-30

I volunteer homeless addicts 'source city' close truth..it's like 40-50. Something I've learned them. 

A fold 4/5 bucks, .1 grams. bun $40/50 1 gram. risk lot likelier cut dealer level fentanyl junk. brick 50 folds/bags, aka 5 buns 5 grams. 250 bags sleeve, 25 grams 5 bricks. wait til Nov thurd! Make sure get popcorn lawn chairs ready! retarded? math. Prorated 2019 census data, cites 0.6%, U.S. little higher we're generally older less Yup, county charge city. Well said. Great example.  South Korea country wide lockdowns. 

They use contact tracing, mask wearing, extreme hygiene, touch testing COVID-19. 

Thanks proving original point. Lockdowns work. logical ways dealing it. (South Korea great example) Zinc. Vitamin C Last 3 days: [81k, 91k, noice, herd immunity soon *dies within* explain? us, conflicting news hear, everything sorta seems fine. Halloween Elections Thanksgiving Christmas New Year

The next two months going be....quite interesting.... :-( already made 100k...

All us, fucked. say masks cloth face coverings? He’s gonna going SC he’ll declaring victory election night everything make reality least three justices pocket. Test more, find more. People looking something scared focus moving variable. No, CFR falling testing going up, treatments improving, we're back surge driven younger people. saying makes sense. got 7 foot long PVC chute ready go. found instructions online quite easy. I’m expecting many trick treaters gonna show safely get candy. Russia stopping us public healthcare provisioning people , going full , enforced lockdown two weeks. fact poor country like India pull can't embarrassing telling need deflect blame outside country think too. done properly am, certain.  pay mine. freebies around here. Yes, something doom/gloom commenters leaving out. Unless deaths increasing similar fashion, really means virus safer thought (more Don’t credit name squatting asshole! makes literally sense. quite exponential increase works. Also consider every person knows average 600 people, take long everyone average knows least one person who's died Covid-19... election 2 4 weeks later, oh dear god poll numbers election results would amazing. unfortunately nation's history current status, Trump *that* big loss Biden. Probably 8-10% popular vote, hopefully enough get electoral college Senate.

If Republicans keep Senate, nation screwed. block anything Democrats try care American people, they'll want make Biden look bad.

It's always Democrat saving nation terrible, moronic, predictably-disasterous republican policy resulting depression. need stop electing Republicans. Thankgiving good giving old people. real spread start tomorrow night though, people worse flu go party en masse. going rain serious genocide. Canada 2.4 No, need prove wrong. IFR together less 0.01%. turned corner right, up... Yes, are. learned much Covid compared knew April. We, whole, general idea treatments work ones don't. also know passes person person, we're able prevent spread within hospitals much greater extent. STILL shortages/quantity restrictions certain PPE items, hospitals, cases, enough keep staff contracting patients.

Another factor likely younger population, manageable symptoms, making higher percentage cases. I've known get it, they're given medication sent home isolation instead staying hospital. Then, physicians essentially say gets worse, let know.

It's also partially cases spread throughout nation instead isolated smaller, densely-packed areas, NYC. Deaths per day way higher before, slowly increasing. 

You're right spike, matter testing. united states government massively failed us misinformation. GO VOTE Yea, silver lining sure. preliminary results US Phase III trials several candidates end November, though Europe Canada bit ahead us, maybe mid month see data efficacy.

Production already ramped major candidates, leaves authorization distribution (which worked past month so). coronavirus pre set kill limit Wait, seriously? Where? website? Huh? I've read book caught bit show... bring hand maids they're fertile wives aren't.... even close. Case numbers growing 15% per week. Fauci assumed America would trying stop it. using leaders super spreaders. website wildly inaccurate. Utah pulling 70 cases per 100k population day doesn’t even us top 8. infection pace 50% higher listed, give us high score deserve! matter scientists point. Trump's cult, roughly half Americans, refusing wear masks social distance. Nobody afford stay home GOP refuses provide relief anyone. think election going change anyone's mind?

Relief bills still stall Senate even GOP loses control. already forgotten still block anything long 41 seats? biggest one PA, Penn State person. lot cases. county hot spot. assertion people things bad country result outside forces fundamentally flawed. Utah got alert saying, wear masks, limit gatherings 10. least mask mandate state wide 🤦‍♀️ Uh, people point? Kushner? Guiliani? think there's sound/intelligent voice room anymore. Wow. Thank replying, I’m always hear uncensored happening nations around world. want talk unreported cases US exactly greatest either. leader actually thinks issue go away stop testing it, half states followers charge. enemies want attack you’re weak. Yeah could see useful large scale. laugh day day positivity rate posts local news stations. testing random sample number people every day, would make good data. tracking positivity rates totally random amounts tests subjects silly me. feel anyone supports second amendment? 

Are guilty dead kids? cold outside going cause problems. Can't gather outdoors anymore easy socially distance. Everyone's headed enclosed already without proper ventilation virus know airborne.

All stuff C4 already control blaze.

Everybody get ready get fucked.  Many countries going second lockdown , need full lockdown two weeks people given assistance provisions could something like normal lives.

But yes know pure fantasy ""if pay $10,000 deductable, continue pay 30% copay, keep functional enough return work dont lose health insurance... die.""
/s guys insane think republicans lol

And say life long democrat fucking hates orange slimeball that's news story people pushing. news story keeps getting pushed terrible statistically tied United Kingdom 9th place. great end world America worse place ever kind stuff. We're supposed scoring game like golf, America decided score like basketball Biden would bandaid wound needs dozen stitches. going help shit. used federal relief money fracking instead.... honestly think even 250k cases 3000+ deaths day would sink. think that's comforting lie tell ourselves. equivalent Pittsburgh get nuked account excess deaths year, 43% country still ride-or-die him.

It breaks fucking brain. Nothing get people leave him. Nothing. imagine high goes right Halloween...

you guys fucked. disappeared like miracle! Possibly right way? like how? stimulus.... Oh ok fact going get point. thought maybe careful could hold long enough vaccine confirms we’re getting it.  Again? feel like I'm seeing headlines new horrific record breaking totals new day.

This insanity effecting mental health. simply can't come terms fact people still think fake. feel like I'm losing mind. I've scheduled doctor's appointment talk anxiety. risking health go doctor's office mental health can't handle anymore. 

This pandemic destroyed faith humanity completely. Lol, guess people would rather downvote actually read thread. Obviously extreme ""yeah, care anymore"" pervasive sentiment people basically saying ""I'm done"". people thread saying ""yeah I'll definitely wear mask late 2021/2022!"" either virtue signaling really real life super redditor types reflect average person real none willing keep restrictions beyond point. point, agreed sure hit “more harm good it. refuse comply take chances. others worried hide beds next 100 point think seeing long listen gonna me. moment vaccines available high risk groups, giving another ounce shit soon elderly relatives get vaccine I'll stop social distancing. can't waste another year gonna happen likely die car accident, yet millions people still drive every single day. I’m gonna start living normal again, y’all ya want take. erect straw man wearing masks can’t confront fact maybe shutting every business large(ish) event harm good kiss fat fucking ass thinks i'm this. Call racist nazi grandma killer want, give fuck used like fauci keeps saying stupid stuff like failing well already stopped wearing masks parties house now. That's new normal.



Note positively upvoted posts.

I mean fuck, there's even meta comments point out. Dude. Another lock happen. People reject it. Even taking seriously, theyll still go ,just mask, **as wearing ones now**. really live society Taiwan Korea democracies never locked amazingly well. statement wrong. HK democracy still elements freedom also well. Btw comrade Taiwan #1 5DN1L! 
Suck Majoritarianism form authoritarianism. Democracy authoritarianism mutually exclusive. basically already agree need authoritarian means control pandemic, like call authoritarianism hiding ""if masses vote authoritarianism"". (a) still is, (b) people vote it, would (if responsible leader) let disease rip anything? paramedic boss says masks work. we're here. Dang. much negativity. applaud trying spread positive message. think important. hope loved ones well. sincerity, really appreciate people trying positive think misinformed that. entirely many motherfuckers planet, especially 1st world consumer motherfuckers like population US. 

It really matter point anyways though. Assuming best case scenarios vaccine created, don’t know think US even political distribute people.

The economic effects virus last least decade.

The lifelong complications people lived infection last generation.

2022, lol. I’m assuming you’re European, pandemic mismanaged fuck keep mind sheer size US fact 50 individual states dealing almost own. governors great, others absolute morons I’m banking another 6 months start get reinfections. comes Turnip’s whole plan herd immunity isn’t logistically possible. Take that, World  Wait 97k cases day starting move winter encouraging lol, joke. thought were...but not. never knew kind stupidity lying surface, waiting brought right person. uhh... yeah. there’s lot “this trump’s fault” going around gutted pandemic preparedness systems, continually refuses public aid, consistently diminishes insults actual doctors trying fix shit heap 

i mean yeah, dems agreeing shittier second stimulus kinda sucked, people going extremes spite party says wear mask fault people they’re spiting. Meh, I've seen plenty people noticing Europe passed us. happened weeks (months? everything seems long) ago even. good know humans pretty much everywhere? equally suck managing pandemic? guess that's consolation here? countries far better US Europe. However, always bound get worse Fall. \*They\* murdered guy

But really, American say much upset Harambe. Yes point thy aren’t needed initial outbreak controlled people follow simple health advice. Live near SF... Rumors going around counties pushing everyone get tested, even completely healthy people never exposed, positivity rate drops Unclear whether that's piece getting at. read purely locational issue: virus blood /endothelium vs. respiratory system, indicating systemic. fuck talking about. getting anywhere fortune cookie comment. YeAh iSlAnD We’ve 3 days week 0 cases Melbourne. lockdown shit works  look bright side. soon, may able tell ass smells like feet. :) think one day vaccine show store without word planning? would tell states prepare distribute vaccine getting store it? fun? Pharmacies won’t getting year wil early next year level. First hospitals facilities essentials general population. 1918 flu like this? Hey I'm Bulgarian US, congrats equally shutty country! Seeing ""strongly recommend "" instead ""ordered law"" signs made lose hope Ohio would better rest U.S.

I say seems like reason make mandate avoid spending last political capital. like teacher tells class everyone stop talking sit still count three. get three nothing happens, students walk teacher rest class. 

All said, thing every politician exhausted capital on. Fuck reelection; fuck lawsuits GOP groups; fuck primary challengers--every single governor mandated masks indoors least decided political capital worth human lives. Scott influencing things, provide justification positions administration already had. recovered flu, yes, resistance strain flu.

The risk lies potentially catching COVID *while* flu. italian, care pasta ;) Joking, thanks clarification. first year cannot get Flu shot :/ honestly thought president entire country, would (and should) mandate steps battle pandemic. 

The president powerful. powers has, power Congress has, powers states complex I'm sure powers has. International Travel restrictions federal funding know controls. believe domestic travel controls, state least, got State leaders page... alas...

I even know means.... Like want call Senators? guess could though I've never heard president country (even two waves) total 0.1% infection rate, whereas America 2.8% infection rate - 28 TIMES higher!!!

Your country litterally middle nowhere making incredibly easy isolate one lowest covid rates world. Like top 5 lowest rates globally. Saying US good like saying college basketball player LeBron James. Apples Oranges. Like that's obvious, litterally everyone else worse you. 

I said US response sucked, argued suck much bunch countries seem ignore. administration officials described unfocused White House, saying coronavirus task force fewer meetings, Trump spends little time thinking handle virus — instead mocking political rallies. Many administration’s top doctors, including Birx, Anthony S. Fauci, director National Institute Allergy Infectious Diseases, Surgeon General Jerome M. Adams, beside growing influence presidential adviser Scott Atlas, neuroradiologist infectious-disease experience whose disputed views herd immunity gained currency Trump, officials said. saw well US responded disaster Katrina. always let people suffer die lack medical care, languish poverty.

Surreal? would surreal US cared citizens. choices absolutely expected. wrote already starting get downvoted... I’ve learned say anything that’s pro lockdown 2025 r/coronavirus better make clear you’re covid denier else won’t go well. Ride covid death ship suckers. Going cruise breeding ground disease covid showed insane. we'll break 90 100 today

Deleted shame coward wrong! 😂 usually rough tally positive / total day's numbers. here's also link [DHS county-by-county even sub-county level total overall. guys done awesome. Watching nz, can’t wait able visit again! Oh fuck off. dark 8 now, means firework nonces trying outdo pots pans brigade. democracies worked - Australia New Zealand - implemented Covid-control policies effectively China did. countries locked still cases. maintained strict lock regime community transmission cases. proves point even democracies need authoritarianism pandemic; every democracy failed. may wish exist perfect society everyone knows right thing. society exist. did, even need laws government. extraordinary events like pandemic, coersive mechanisms government deploy make even unwilling tow line order protect greater good. That's definition authoritarianism. look anti-maskers think violating freedom make wear mask, widespread proliferation disinformation anti-vaxx propaganda forms conspiracies propaganda. Therein lies another example much freedom actually takes away people's freedoms. Western countries learning one age political disinformation: censorship (currently implemented tech companies) also necessary ensure functioning society distinguish truth fiction. Like username! grandad's family Bulgaria (Jewish though). Thats really, really bad. fair though Czechia population medium-sized US state. 

Some states positivity rates high 40% range right now. upside, CA guidelines clearly drawn lines schools open. cases start go back up, schools close. isn’t like areas opened refuse close matter bad things get. Yeah hey we'll get time! in....whoever lives lives. Survival fittest all. That's evolution right there. mean technically going cliff type turning corner High score! fuck happened country man. better this. You’re spot on, anyone trying deny truth statement either hasn’t read recent climatological datasets denial/is paid denial. Anyone searching truth find accuracy claims. shutdown almost 3 months. Enough enough, shutdowns. elderly lock home till Jesus fucking Christ Trump loses charged sort crime humanity. It’s quite genocide homicide. akin president using biological weapon used people. mean this? “Before idiots downvote oblivion”

“+14”

Lol maybe cool hostility tad? Elsewhere, pass laws shit, believe not.  I’ve gotten one many COVID related arguments today I’m stepping back. get sides, don’t blame workers getting it. That’s all. lead resistance virus (i.e. research shows it’s rare re-infected Covid) make susceptible catching experiencing worse symptoms different virus. real issue much money, quickly starts accelerate invested mechanisms like stock market.

Once hit point like 5 million dollars, live like king *doing nothing* collecting interest, *still* make money, boosting ever higher. did, paying attention also apparently lazy basic Vaccine ain't coming summer  heard US rounding corner, ""almost nobody"" dies it. feel like I've lied to. That's beauty. Sardines low food chain, thus they're low heavy metals. consume absurd levels get anything close dangerous levels mercury. know already  actually voted! dropped mail day. unfortunately don’t get one stylish stickers, golly personally can’t afford another 4 years trump. biden’s bandaid, bandaid preferable several gunshot wounds point. 


the strangest thing though, people still panic buying. can’t find ISO alcohol anywhere unless buy kiloliter, ain’t scientist needs quantity. they’re wearing masks *while go stores panic buy.*


loudly complaining people wearing masks least helped stay away me. Romney ripped apart left 2012. anyone thinks there’s considerable difference testing capabilities March now? denying covid, opposed masks, denying 2nd wave, curious. real numbers beginning? British listen policy change. made illegal/mandated follow.

Same thing Australia. Well Trump done absolutely fuck it, I'll gladly credit anyone actually tries something shower useless shit Can't wait die, yey 2021 bring it!! Fake news: Trump administration already beat coronavirus. /s Taiwan's 1.5% cfr lines closely reality PRC's fantasy numbers.

It even ridiculous consider beginning outbreak understandably lacking testing numbers. mean... numbers great though. Would say effective? I'd take 6 months lockdown worked 3 years quasi-normal masked-up life.  herd immunity isn’t thing without vaccine. Wrong assumptions right start. says 400k newly infected Oct 31... accurate? believe sometime around May saying we'd start seeing 300k cases per day August September. YEAH AMERICA #1!!!!! USA! USA! USA! India catching #1 spot, Trump decides YOLO whole country. likely may one happy hypoxia cases. outward signs sickness nowhere need emergency care. watched Idiocracy back thought never could potentially happen. even 20 years later we're road straight towards it. not? Thank you. I've updated comment. NUMBER 1 BEIBAYY many days, last 30 days, set new record one-day increase? many days, *in-a-row?* I'm downvoting this. Reading 5 times idea there's actually suppose coherent thought here.  It’s circle. feel you, dont feel bad, alone, suggestions intentional, even though didnt work. start reading history books disastrous events. often follow similar trends, never tell ""this can't happen here"" always can.


i say things public officials telling general public bother simple masks, news stories simultaneously going around hospital staff panicking resorting wearing bandannas inside hospitals massive ppe shortage.

 news stories suppose foment outrage response readers governments lack response crisis, missed finer important point multiple health workers (experts) front lines using simple masks protect around disease.


Be skeptical public servants. school shooting statistics skewed mean can't get hospital bed matter hospital survival rate is? /s

I think Covid19 death rate can't get hospital bed 5%? Noob here. long till economy collapses? Bro amount times I've see ""biggest one-day increase record"" swear local hospital gets overwhelmed shutting whether give shit not. one wants take risk send hospital bunch COVID patients. Goddam sobering post mf. Stay safe, player. Mmmmm fcuk Hmm, that's weird way saying trump ended pandemic. Yes, still try. Well reading comprehension would understood meant said offhanded. Look means.

The one thing got correct need sources. could've simply said.

Aaand there's full insult end. Really progressing here, we. Victoria (Australia) 4 months hard lockdown. stopped tracks. 1 month. So... yes no. Also, USA way worse position Victoria ever was, probably need longer. need people actually cooperate. absolutely work I'm sad say probably can't USA's current political climate. Especially they're box cats. Good you. mean that. Enjoy time away nonsense. People start learn take distancing seriously loved ones start careless.  wear-a-mask-and-distance-serious weld door shut serious. unfortunately people either believe latter serious former. Glass half full. don’t believe numbers. It’s 4 days election... remember watching video feeling really sorry her, know is. could tell probably given Trump briefing totally understand said. looked embarrassed put spot. know saw good news, revised 0 earlier afternoon. Break doughnuts. America exist point anymore. better ready fight make mistake thinking people power know exactly they're doing.

They're quite sophisticated. Yes, see opportunity pull shit... mostly limited legislative equivalent klepto left alone kitchen fine silverware's kept. They're certainly pulling Mission Impossible heists.

Mostly them, covid serves useful distraction. see neither advantage disadvantage pandemic running uncontrolled. Number tests done still influences rate though. Places enough testing allowing tests unless person sick. higher positivity rate. positivity rate fatality rate much higher right? That’s Germany somewhere around 12-16 days behind countries. 100% convinced four weeks enough bring numbers down, even us. France hope lower case numbers 5,000 day four weeks mind boggling look took bring numbers spring. Measure Health Well-Adjusted Profoundly Sick Society clue family get it? Look finger oximeter. got mine Walgreens years ago. Amazon many medical supply online stores carry them. used $20, pandemic know going for, priced them. 

With oximeter make sure fingers warm. used freak low oxygen level readings figured cold fingers giving low readings. slow soon. 330 million Americans, exponential growth fast!

At growth rate 15% per week double every 5 weeks so. Say 100k day next 5 weeks 3.5 million, 200k 5 weeks +7 million, +14 million, +28 million, 5 months get 52.5 million cases. 5 weeks +56 million, +112 million, slow enough people left infect. America's fighting really hard keep Europe. /s I'm sure they've got better things protect public health, like harassing black people breaking peaceful protests. 800k seems bit low someone *has* convince Trump something want hear. Yes. Exactly. Going exponential case growth! would less 1% 10%. kidding? change? someone leadership believes SCIENCE facts. enough reasonable person want Biden office instead Trump (given point hes basically option). Here's ""legitimate solution"" wear masks, plea humans also wear masks, distribute medical supplies need instead giving states support politically, maybe, maybe, give shit people EVEN agree politically. live somewhere has. Taking seriously March means lives back normal ages. Fuck lies.

I agree sentiment failed contain March pretty true can't get rid corona. There's literally way we'd could eliminate without vaccine. Remember vote. say ""freedom assembly"" it. One five enumerated rights.

However, know anyone seriously interprets mean government broad public health powers.

And certainly mean masks can't required. ""***I DECLARE COVID BANKRUPTCY!***"" impeach various crimes post says US world everyone know Halloween party except me. People fucking dumb Probably need mandate laws penalties (or even reward program reporting violations )  Slovakia eastern European either find iso alcohol longest time! got way excited finally find it....I'm losing mind possibly. think every comment copied top level comment. young people aren’t wasting years prime life. won’t happen

That's kind along original point. comment replied basically talking pleading people take seriously got tons comments subreddit basically saying ""we'll give months"" flat saying ""yeah... no"". This. Someone told pals get money open back Christmas. 

Also think seeing neighbours one one must encourage it. First France Germany, Belgium, England...who else next? 

Hopefully works many friends back UK talking incessantly Christmas plans sound like social distancing mind. I'm staying well clear OH LOL GOOD ONE halloween! Yes lot factors play, that's part reason said 'more less'.

It's 'safer' sense cases have, lower IFR drops, guess really trying say there. point, someone US, I’m tossing eggs every basket can. feel grateful every time see country locking down. seeing countries daily. many lives spared countries.

I zero faith US point much anything it’s far beyond point something done make big difference. even do, watch reaction masses here. Fights, protests, it’s going get ugly. Many conditioned essentially brainwashed. can’t imagine world sees US now.

Stay safe there. I’ll here, continuing toss eggs. North dakota double per million capita cases New York State has. Pretty crazy stuff Trump best numbers.... Actually, compare “daily new cases” “daily deaths”, I’m proven right link. what’s matter? You’re going keep armadillo helmet regardless. Chicken pox different virus never cleared infected population way get herd immunity really vaccination.

With covid look like virus stays dormant forever. USA USA USA USA USA USA USA USA USA USA every 100k infected 500-1000 people die meant corner graph linear exponential growth. funny Americans Europeans take turns patting back ""winning COVID"" neither spread anywhere close control. worry, 2 weeks Halloween spike push US cases 200k day Europeans last laugh way successful herd immunity. regularly beat crap pointing progressive policies led to. documented stats support it. Complete 100! Congrats, gang! one ever believed would seeing grea... what? it’s bad? Oh.. Would lock slow rate infection? Yes. Would stop virus? No.

Fact we're simply going keep see-sawing back fourth either vaccinations end pandemic mortality rate drops enough negligible actual fuck america rn think he's lost - ""oh fuck, that's wrong corner, I'm gonna look bad, quick call Fox make something Biden."" That's sad. Maybe people see happens abroad let covid rip population they'll see different light worry, spoke truth. interviews still posted youtube this. limited old infirm. killed lot good people. Highest countries. Nice America number 1 paid eons. Good luck getting one Canada though lol No. Madrid experiencing temperature 22 degrees tomorrow, Milan 17, Paris 18, London 16. Compare temperatures July 15th. Madrid 33, Milan 27, Paris 22, London 18. anything, Madrid's temperature would forced people inside, temperature differences latter three locations would make really impact human behavior. Winter sufficient explanation, unless like present argument viral infectivity levels. I'll glad see it. Exactly right. policy one love bury. Anyone 65 older care home denied hospitalization, oxygen given morphone. ""Palliative care"" warranted another word murder. keep hospitals overflowing instituting exact policies ""palliative care"" younger patients. Where’re law order ! No, no, meant “turning coroner.”  Sheriff county CA thing. would really like hear legitimate solutions blame. Seriously. 
Also Biden gets elected people actually think going change? Corona cases Corona deaths treating like something new? \~43% Covid deaths influenza pneumonia listed comorbidities.

[CDC Comorbidity table 3.

This also raises question of: say certainty Covid deaths influenza pneumonia deaths? P kills plenty people own. Records made broken honestly know. I'm even sure went events shut year. like drive-thru events saw. However, sister really shown much care sort safety. She'll wear mask, kids karate classes rest county locked down. recently moved highest tier, going July last peak.

She also travels seemingly time, think beach like six times. swear damn miracle gotten yet - course, there's always possibility asymptomatic.

I dunno. I'm glad groups safe - but, still seems like unnecessary risk especially country hitting records daily. vote 11/3, wearing mask around (I live NY).

I highly suggest go top full protection(N95, face shield, gloves, etc. ) Wear something took doorway. confirmed cases, correct? number could possibly already much higher people don’t know it. quite funny even borders closed can't tackle transmission numbers people already living Europe. Anyone hearing alarm bells? Life expectancy 70 future? already are, every person work republican area saying communists even suggesting it. really wish virus targeted idiocy.  *[There map corner (OC)* coulda sword saw ""biggest one-day increase record"" like 5 different days week Lockdown old, medically vulnerable let rest live lives... Refer Barrington declaration.

Mass job losses consequences lockdown worth it. See, can't nice things, fellow NYers. Please stop making rest us look bad. Poverty mainly. Yup. Originally joined cat got one went missing several days (he wandered back eventually) mostly ok long don’t pay much attention comments past year really depressing awakening seeing around fell matters BOM, COVID safety, spouting whatever Trumpism heard last. president orchestrating superspreader events, matter time. major US election Tuesday. kind big deal us regarding that. free post numbers global cases want. change want see. Nevada still 2-3 week delay testing doctors recommending people self quarantine instead getting test. assume that’s numbers “low” here. Ok. follow rules. Hmmm, good doctor made another mistake. That's least two. reason believe point. Amiright?

HUGE /S (just case) Still. Europe. allowed send one person per household per day get groceries. 

Actually, heyday pandemic, one person per household every 3 days. brutal. 

It worked millions volunteers going door-2-door deliver groceries. ""Into oncoming traffic."" Blah, least tell people use face covering home made mask Sheeple* ffs  Yeah, know 6% figure speak of. basically saying 6% died ""solely"" COVID, ie purely respiratory failure manifestation. However, look medical field counts causes death, simple black white. overlap data tallied patients pneumonia, COPD exacerbation, MI hospitalization, sometimes impossible say three finally patient in. counted line unfolded course hospitalization sequence death certificate. true prior COVID. CDC reference basically saying 6% patients die COVID COVID death certificate. surprising given medical field keep alive even organ systems failing. person presents COVID dies ICU may end renal failure, pulmonary embolism, stroke, MI etc death certificates well. Making cause death purely ""COVID"" relatively rare. possible Reddit posters simply clue they're talking about

Good question. WH literally nothing.

Not True, bet Trump crony passed information Russia, 2016 elections. think variant discussed article Norway different, mutated shorter spike protein. waiting information variant, thus far I've seen 1 mutation mentioned.

If Norwegian variant would spread across Europe, surpassing local variants increasing considerably frequency, maybe someone would write actual scientific article it. Mutations happen time, effect behaviour virus. 

You right one knows variants originated Spain, surely got propagated there, since highest frequency, seemingly seeded countries it. I'm blaming Spain, could've happened anywhere lots cases tourism, kind forum easier refer ""variants originated Spain"" ""Variant Eu20.A.1.abc"". impossible pinpoint exact location patient major variant emerged, unless would sequence positive cases impossible.  Louisiana's testing data difficult visualize tracker. reason axis right side (test Positivity) default scaled range 0-300%, makes test positivity line look completely flat.
 
You manually change y-axis value something reasonable, like 30%. click top number Oh, civil war 2? Yeah that’s really gonna happen 🙄  source suspected? many verified, then? Youre initial post certainties. self-proclaimed le reddit intellectual takes word china face value Paying people stay home would right way. Sturgis, fuck yeah Why? Looking countries, stricter lockdown longer seems keep it.

They start revert maatregels see drop starting.

Very good kept workable. Complete isolation 6-8 weeks would hell anyway kept. know many people break essential movement time time first wave anyway long happens Nov 3rd, care. United States Absolute Idiocy. Get lost.  DUH. known death trolls like Elon Musk concentrate maximize lies cases death hospitalizations caught up.

This way lie maximum effectiveness. Musk taken advantage delay 3 times already, death trolls it. Theoretically country way worse US. whole country full lockdown again.  Going back Taiwan first time 3 years winter... maybe come back US lmao agree . “ plenty years left “ comment moronic considering know someone age 12 cancer wasn’t getting scans etc lockdown . cancer advanced stage . lockdown KILLING people literally . That's happens man decides integrity election allowed run election. kidding, 2010, sick I'm pretty sure h1n1, knocked ass weeks. one weekend thought needed go hospital needed care would die. Half population? think you’re spending much time online.. Give us week, we're hit 7 figures total cases. Donald JR tweeted fight corona defeated?

How..? 1500 nurses died WW1? find extremely hard believe. Shit wild back boys trying scientists.

Donnie holding super-spreading events country. Rounding corner huh.... Ooh good another delay inevitable. waste fucking time. Yeah family isolate home feel comfortable. I'm going isolation center. Bruh... Belgium got 100,000+ cases week time population 23 times smaller... comparing apples oranges. 3%-11% population US catches flu (and symptoms) every year, stands reason small number infections **can** controlled taking measures taking. flu around long time, us either vaccinated once, means use measure resistance flu virus. flu usually kills young, elderly, immunocompromised. also flu asymptomatic, btw. 

 Covid-19 brand new, meaning nobody **any** resistance built it, spreading like wildfire despite efforts many. Also, places currently spreading fastest places people ignoring guidelines CDC.  stopped covid, countries disciplined enough follow rules. $10 says can't even _spell_ ""amendment"". Mmmmhmh, live Austria ""not screwing around"" really would describe it. second lockdown several weeks late probably enough now. Yeah hated rest world

Though, Trump too, so...  joke think source kind politicized bias source. literally list peer-reviewed studies. I'm sorry science hard you. good night. wait what? .. though like 1000 people dying daily, many flippin' people die cancer heart disease?!!! China. Basically everything China done since March correct answer. Positive cases lot non risk people getting really want test theory wild running risk getting sick dying sick crippled first time second? best possible outcome get nothing already running gauntlet. I'm going world like came it. Naked screaming. feeling nauseous fact France national mask mandate since end August, they're going lockdown surge cases. seemed hope US willing impose stricter rules masks -- think Fauci Redfield stated masks help get things control.

But masks failed get things control France, evidenced fact they're lockdown, hope US have?

(Don't want start ""masks work"" thread. genuinely want know wtf going wrong France.) Rule Britannia, God save queen least Funny Valentine gave shit America stop people catching covid, countries took seriously eliminate it. Covid spreads easily normal flu viruses. country failed eliminate it, uneducated, undisciplined population (RSA).  Saw conspiracy someone referring 1984 reference democrats. absolute irony single comment. protected encouraged lying seeded current predicament.

Had stood truth back January,perhaps things would different.

Where buck end? Well least they’re winning something. We’re #1! Greatest country world! Influenza deadly covid, difference is, vaccine lower R0. Yep, overheard several students talking party weekend. Oh convenient.. wait wait wait lol, said ad hominem calling bot ad hominem? lol dude real satire.

So let's go happened, posted BS biased fuck source zero credibility, acted like source MIT worse. realized ridiculous sounded try defend source instead gave bullshit stat infections rising growth rate clearly worse states without mask mandates.

Now true colors come ridiculous diaper face stuff lol, say spread air droplets? think far away clearly common way spreads.

You sir laughable joke. look figures tell scale 1 10 much faith China ever honest CDC rest pretty easy get rid coronavirus access multiple secret concentration camps send people to. happy government people western washington handling it. Everyone's wearing masks stores around months people taking seriously. Hopefully keep lower move winter Another super spreader event ....

In month US gets closer holidays, especially around Christmas families visit other, going see US numbers spike indoor gatherings become extremely common. work school that’s chosen hybrid 75 % enrollment. Many kids don’t think Covid real. Many masks noses constantly. come contact probably 100 day least. wondering I’m risk. Little sanitation besides spray bottle wipe desks period. Little communication. described? No. even little bit. also makes several contradicting claims post history talks like learned medicine Grey's Anatomy Scrubs. Also hospital claims work female ER physicians. checked.

She's lying internet points. That's day wife ordered masks, January. knew America fucked. Where? cliff? Lol Around world? New Zealand packed stadiums masks issues fuck around. 5 days late conversation, sorry that, want say barking wrong tree. country can't seem give fuck anyone me, myself, going go overloaded health care approach.

Unfortunately, takes friends family getting ending overloaded system something click. roommate's dad one those. entire household got he's ER. deniers personally effected, make progress. Covid way contagious due aerosol transmission. Yea, Republicans go opinions instead science definitely ones practicing medicine 🤔 wow. Torn disbelief surprised. lie maintained election over. genocide. Masterminding attacks Kenya numbers accurate. also mass tested large cities. recommend basic research contained covid. lockdowns.  underestimate capitalism's suicidality. think number $1200 podcast 'Knowledge Fight' makes fun him. highly recommend it. Also, you’ve ever pneumonia, smoke, age 65... get pneumonia shot too! CDC website showing USA numbers working. Taiwan country? federal government utmost power within borders, unlike province. Who's going nerve stop them? Tbf second wave seems one big wave US look graphics. 

In European countries easily distinguish 2 waves, whereas US almost never stopped growing Much better US, still much worse thought. expected Germany better.

There pockets US much better numbers: NY + CA/OR/WA. they're also locked Germany there's that. saying anything isn’t common knowledge. played along necessary, IMO. I’m suggesting motives bad.  Chief covered union. Lol one neighbors that? ""Doors corners, kid. That's get you. Doors corners."" -Miller level responded obviously can't happen North America 

I think different set priorities higher up, hard imagine mobilising troops stop pandemic. dispersing protesters worked excuse moving troops, enforcing lockdown? Wow, anecdotal experience totally refutes reality! wish would spoken sooner could gotten past long time ago. Many increasingly opinion they’d made big mistake coming trees first place. said even trees bad move, one ever left oceans.

-Douglas Adams That's one theory. course geographically isolated, one island, might well be.  opinion matches every single epidemiologist says eradicating covid via lockdowns impossible? 

You low IQ cretin use science SACRIFICE FAMILY COMMINY!

You fucking joke. Imagine every state eventually 10k daily cases, insane. world record trump proud #U. #S. #A!  #U. #S. #A!  #U. #S. #A! Ireland well think I'm promoting conspiracy, well is, kinda sorta, Trump WH, sense manipulating control *information access* order retain *political* control public health problem.

That's deliberate, admitted move WH, exactly secret anything. 

Jared Kushner came right said treating pandemic political issue instead public health one, again, yes, someone actually planning this. used language ""taking control back"" doctors, pretty clear he's talking about.

But one's asking hospitals make political policy trying to. see reading deep something that's pretty basic hospital administrative planning, like knowing capacity status hospitals within medivac range dealing acute care crises. 

There *have* news stories year hospitals blindly calling around trying move patients they're unable care them. nice could call ones seem available first?

And one thing *is* clear fewer people addressing *NON*-Covid health issues, also create crisis own. That's saving grace this. again, people waiting non-Covid, still important, health care knows whether local hospital overwhelmed not? point, putting treatment starts creating issues well. gave up. Oh well... hopefully learned lesson assumptions make look like ass... British paper called Daily Mail exactly Sweden always presented us 👍 Economy collapse employees companies. employes companies taxes. taxes money hospitals + another big troubles. Welcome capitalism, friend.

Things needs balanced somehow. Total nonsense. way keep humidity winter letting cold fresh air in. cold air outside warmed dry. told practicing frequent window opening public spaces. going get worse. We're going look back time planet lost half population. great grandkids going ask us realize terrible thing??? we're going let know, slow burn.

For one thing, there's going hell lot movies people refuse acknowledge bad things happening, already zeitgeist, it'll standard literally know 3 different Halloween parties happening Saturday. 🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️ Thanks Chicago 2023. USA! USA! USA! everyone did, large majority aye, everyone’s fed now. government keeps changing minds changing system.

Remember protests hundreds thousands people.. lot people don’t care they’re ones ruin everyone Thank sane one. What's demoncracy good can't shit? champagne! want lifetime politicians government went wrong way got flu back February say enjoyable. probably least decade prior that, remember anyway. breathing issues all, achy fatigued could barely get bed day half fairly sick almost full week. blood hands too! know mean hehehe cares? Reddit saying covid end world since started it'll get worse right? Permanent social distancing lockdowns ect ect we're never going back normal right guys? happy wartime now, covid. Where's martial law? Free catch covid that's mean. France broke 49k yesterday population 65M. Comparing proportionally, America would 250k cases day match France’s rate.

All bad around, interesting math. 1 25 adults US infected Coronavirus. secret agents spreading shit purpose war America whats causing Surge? ""The first generation vaccines likely imperfect, prepared might prevent infection rather reduce symptoms, and, even then, might work everyone long."" - vaccine top-lady UK inside knowledge scientific analysis vaccines. fairly sure give immunity. china say January? one today, data research now? thought prisons hit hardest can't wait till election fear mongering stops. hospital near 3 people sick, slow ages. private school know 900 students person nobody one kid got sick. feed fear monster. thought could two weeks. can’t imagine sick long. Even cold, that’d awful. I'm gas lighting. really moron Fauci talks every President faced health care Gates predicted America's lack preparedness. 

PREDICT defunded Trump. isolated one infectious disease every 4 bad USA compared countries? Supposed best country world. sheriff El Paso basically said wasn’t going enforce stay home orders hey, it’s thought counts. Also remember countries experiencing worse right now.

Crazy Trump managed influence pandemic Czech Republic! 

Time Americans realize virus care politics US twice many deaths country 4 times population. 850-1000 people dying states every 24 hours Covid. That’s one 911 every 3.5 days, yet it’s still “drama” many. literally can’t make it’s insane Kind like people religion: I’ll take want misinterpret want! know people. People feed machine paycheck. (I people :( ... )  Oh, thank you. explains it. YOLO sure? cruise lines talking returning routes since August. think several false starts, surely they've preparing time. white house lying huh? Anyone understands math probably  Corporations fault like you. seem cool curiosity, what's main difference going cruise staying really nice hotel (aside ports stop at)? bollocks though isn’t it? Everyone abide stay inside like last time Unfortunately doesn’t work like that. Two weeks incubation period, necessarily long someone — could infectious many weeks. 

There also essential services still need keep running even people lockdown — shelf stackers, nurses, delivery people etc. Even locked couldn’t leave homes hour day, people still getting virus places taking home families even realised sick. hit extremely hard health aged care here. USA USA USA! honestly suggesting Clinton would told hundreds thousands citizens  literally put opinions comment studies context quotes

It's since challenged find one example. hard, right? Road 100k, #yeswecan #nevergiveup 😂 Instead focusing one small subset deaths comparing small subset deaths world war, let’s actually real comparison overall global fatalities:

WW1: Approximately 40 million dead.
Covid 19: 1.2 million dead far.

I’d rather pandemic world war day. wish people would stop apples oranges comparisons.  Yeah heard day co-workers # “It gone election” 

-my entire Trump supporting family Better get poop knife. still provide immunity. take edge symptoms. Maybe years vaccine provide immunity. initial set won't. well known fact. Setting aside fact ""immunity"" covid lasts 3 months, explain vaccine trigger cytokine storm adults MIS-C children, immune responses virus?  Prison! ""Can get much higher?"" Wrong. president ended pandemic first term. official White House press release says USA always want number one ? Probably start demanding know Obama 9/11 Hurricane Katrina, too. Less 50* lost popular vote pretty large margin considering small percentage people actually vote. Love man! ❤️❤️ people morons. Dr. Birx Dr. Fauci best given. It’s fault Trump team cannot convinced reason. mission save country COVID, publicly calling president supposed help things? Fire cops comply. Simple. Yes

Also missed zero, 100k day reminder, conservative death rate 1.5%. That’s 1500 death sentence. Plus reporting went whack July. month WH strangely took reporting CDC. Knew watch figure since then. Deaths stagnated “unexplained deaths 300,000+ previous years. 100k infections tomorrow mean another 1500 approx death. anyone seen Contangion farking zombie movie show map projected growth critical mass? We’re living it. per usual, someone isn’t listening scientists till it’s late. dreaming holiday outside US next couple years, stop planning. You’ve got time. austria got nearly 6,000 new cases population 8 Million, why’s every country acting like theyre better US great idea, Chinese it, something infected test whole city. old patients? Three days Halloween people cleared WalMart shelves candy. 

To give perspective walmart 20 even 30 pallets halloween candy leading end holiday. Nov 1 6am shelf. 2020 different. 3-5 associates constantly rotating inventory.

No one takes covid19 serious. business usual majority Americans feel entitled celebrate every holiday normal remainder lives. thought sacrificing single year tradition, celebration, socializing MUCH BARE, commit betterment literally every single person TORTURE. People selfish, entitled, unreasonable, cowardly little shits weak resolve dominantly fucking stupid. get worse end sight unless vaccine becomes available. hospitals run yet? still good shape. we're back thousand dead day? We're definitely acting like idiots hottie movie.

Being let something big ruin social structure economy. dumb. can't general strike people fucking money savings we're barely getting by.

Of convince Biden Trump admin provide striking workers means try.

The neolibs give shit Republicans enjoy watching poor suffer. Here's ""plandemic"" worry about. China Russia see stupid completely incapable handling viral outbreak like this, hell start making releasing them? could literally bankrupt us tear us apart without firing shot. mean like one 20 young men died 20 years ago see didn’t want put much fight World War Two 👻

I’m guy 😁

Going roll houses tonight Unfortunately yes. Stay strong faith Sweden experimented strategy time nobody fucking clue virus worked spread best. Wishing horrible feet work dick thing digging local person's social media profile. someone know someone who's political vocal. Three posts jumped me:

- heartbreaking video little boy devastated losing grandpa

- long copypasta angry we're anything mitigate spread wants things normally body, choice

- thanks praying family member intensive care three months due COVID-19

And that's gets me. person clearly empathy people lost loved ones. clearly know least one person nearly died, hospitalized THREE MONTHS due COVID-19, still give shit. Republican, hold position simultaneously big deal trying slow spread means committing decades economic hardship loneliness. Meanwhile countries already went back normal... trend make sense computational biology standpoint? following super duper extra closely weeks now, what's current rate doubling? 5 days? 8 days?

Or flip question, long expect wait hits 200k/day? can’t serious. actually excusing Trump’s admin behavior policy, republican senate “being ignorant, result action”? Hospitals told make plans prepard event everything goes perfectly vaccine ready roll then. mean going happen. fool think rural low income parts of. China absolutely devastated. would also fool think would report numbers even test regions.

Most China third world state.
Im betting hundred bucks stray dog eating parts China arent well. Can't eat mask on. lot Thanksgiving family celebrators going receiving flowers Christmas. like Chinese murder free speech advocates Uighers. Fuck Micheal Bay shit. quiz - north america north korea Post March:

""The number confirmed coronavirus cases around world reached Joke's flu already covid actually think it’s good idea. Wish could US infections spiraling control...maybe could get somewhat together way. don’t see ever happening. Sweeden increases testing * FTFY That's jokes France surrenders dumb imo... ""Look idiots believing shit government shovels them""


""Im glad government legit tells truth"" Worse hysteria occur NHS overwhelmed? don’t think so. Equate actions racist cop oppressive regime currently thousands minorities detention center camps simply ethnicity religious beliefs. Makes sense. suspect people around world a) understand b) socially acceptable care science school. even ""cool"" bad physics, maths etc. stuff nerds. 

When ""high school"" (""Gymnasium"" Germany) really liked scientific subjects. grades pretty good. went study physics University. course bunch nerds (I one myself) 3-4 girls 300 people. 

Nobody understood could it. Everybody said ""eww physics gross, never understood good guess"". perfect continuation colleagues said high school. 

Another great argument always ""why tf need physics maths science? calculator Wikipedia"". people start thinking late. course ***I knew*** science needed cars, cell phones, computers, basically every aspect modern life.

But would anyone else care? simply consumers. Whatever job found definitely ""need"" know electromagnetic induction worked. 

Now science actively interferes peoples' lives want it. never liked it, scientists nerds irrelevant lives, sometimes even bullied popular people. possible nerd high school wants tell live? 

Exponential growth, virus transmission, whatever, things understood majority people. Add nutjobs people different agenda arrive situation right now. amplified variety social media existing.  percentage people capable learning personal experience staggering. instance random though.
The meme used whenever someone suggests something risky stupid order make money. 
It response joke post saying that. point even Biden elected harsh measures put place there's way stop it. right Trump it'll become huge massive problem FOX Republicans. story opened emergency meeting work last week. Texas divided trauma areas, entire panhandle trauma area A, that’s work. hospital informed made ready accept patients entire panhandle next however long. receiving facility. told staff patient ratios long bed accepting. hospital I’m lucky quite bit unused space put people FEMA sending us nurses open additional units case neighboring towns all. Many hospitals, most, critical access hospitals meaning, less 40(?) beds located underserved area. counties one two doctors ENTIRE COUNTY, it’s rural. hospital actively preparing happen since March. plans place, hope never use them. prepared. 

Honestly tho, worst part lack concern within communities. Churches still pack Sundays (no masks), people still go eat constantly, local bowling alley stacked parking lot last week (way 100 people small space, joke) mask mandates anywhere outside Amarillo Lubbock. People don’t care. it’s registering don’t covid doesn’t mean won’t need hospital. heart attack one available take beds critical care units, die waiting exactly happened man. 

As nurse gut-wrenching feeling know somewhere someone went work day idea taking care people instead left completely helpless unable provide person needed live. Something normally wouldn’t difficult all. care best ability 9 hours, praying help would come, praying would turn differently watch man slowly die literally nothing else could done. could simply burst appendix (arguably simple abdominal surgical procedure) could happen anyone. can’t even imagine wrecked entire ER staff must be. Talk PTSD. That’s job works. That’s what’s supposed happen. heart goes staff patients family. 

....But man, public gatherings absolute refusal protect around totally worth end right? Yeah, sitting Belgium cases 6x worse per-capita US currently. Western Europe failed even harder US nice excuse like Trump blame. part Janssen covid vaccine trials.  Got's final season sucked bad, 2020's. work large employer UK. usually provide flu shots staff. year none available due low stock. Well billy bobs america think mask wearing taking rights away. talking enemies people country know better actually working country's interests financial/personal gain? 

I'll take honest enemy false friend day. I'm AZ live shit hole. flaunt upper middle class pretend rich. know poor is, probably Scottsdale. Go broadway main keep driving east want know rich actually is. Yeehaw-leban. Thats great! think going faster = better.

there already tremendous emergency incentive first vaccine. #1 #1 #1 #1!!! 
He say we’re “gonna get tired winning”. also summer Australia winter Northern Hemisphere seems significant factor transmission rates Easter remember someone wanted churches packed day, heat summer suppose make go away. think people get infected shops home family friends ?
Also, think lot people go walking forest winter ?  Wow, mean one follows other? Hard believe. /s like fantasize over, pull Columbus statues replace Fauci statues. possible believe China totalitarian state huge human rights problem actually successfully contain Covid. contradictory.

I like Chinese system government. mean never anything right, that's much misconception. Unfortunately case. majority Americans decipher scientific study, read graphs, comprehend long term actions.

Back January telling people going serious. March president said would quickly, laughed cried.

I told people COVID-19 similar viruses season. often know. vaccine made long good for? chances mutating (the actual strand found 2015 huge scientific journal written it) quickly alternative strain vaccines made.

With majority Americans saying take vaccine, point making one? major problem along Education respect. countries common wear masks one sick flu season. USA people understand way living. core unless things change never recover.

USA recover fully 2028 longer people continue fight wearing masks proper precautions. Including companies. Companies care, health board advisors inspect give citations they're scared they'll lose job ect... disconnect happened 4 years ago, election Trump heralding mistrust institutions promotion ""alternative facts"" Thanks that. really complicated scenario. explanation makes sense though. RemindMe! 2 months Oh yeah go protest lock measures. Protest liberty taken away. Liberty health. Good job muricans. That's problem. know can't trust people keep distance.
It needs enforced like France, even people break rules would still less now.

As lockdown, need second one... That's point. First one normal government learnt nothing it. way that, point later like month two, enforce full lockdown. usual agree wholeheartedly Douglas Adams I'm pharmacist UK I've turn away hundreds patients (some high risk) flu shot stock exist, demand ridiculously high year. Yet seems interuption commercial clients, funny talents.

He say anything common sense person known. boss two them. I'm actually scared me. feel awful morning. people tamping models predict large increases cases unrealistic. No, easy. ""Are American?"" Done. know curious sentiment accurate. answer behalf OP, mom Taiwanese chinese citizenship even though dad mainland.

As much China claims taiwan, taiwan ROC also claims China. That's believe Taiwan trying change passport ROC Taiwan avoid confusions agree...the United States compare performance to...Belgium...

How many people U.S. locate Belgium map? true all, take Spain federation multiple strong independence movements even terrorist movements. lot autonomy given regions. empirical evidence suggest Trump tells base virus rounded corner (when fact surging 10k cases/day), truly believe (on statistical predictable basis) reliably uninformed? eviction moratorium lifted xD Better read user agreement Kinda sad. like US. saying United States, world super power, compare to...Italy...? 7-day trend states showed CT far better RI. looked charts yesterday (best friend lives CT). Comparatively speaking, CT looked pretty good them.

RI, sad state, shockingly badly. response, Gov called press conference yesterday, lowering allowable social groups 10 banning attendees school sports.

Wow. week two ago, seeing looming, banned using break rooms. Underwhelming.

Truth is, RI’s really poor compared neighbors. think can’t close things (in-person school, restaurants, gyms) state needs fed help fund would put work.

And cavalry ain’t coming. Trump took seriously. went golfing first recorded death. one denied seen.

What’s deny? accusations haven’t fully explored yet. investigations still ongoing (since July) new information available. accusations turn true hear it. Meanwhile, don’t pretend established facts. make sad. highlights American ignorance needs addressed. 2323 I'm remembering back someone told 100. here. Expect worse, happy not. conduct illegal operation, sure would set servers eu-central-1 AWS. See?! wrong! Suck it, science! source...

""What makes plague a plague?

We don’t use word plague only refer infectious disease specifically caused bacterium Yersinia pestis.
Plague can also mean “an epidemic disease causes high mortality” “pestilence.” figuratively, plague can mean “any widespread, calamity, evil,” especially one considered direct punishment God.

Hey man said ended..... cool we’re good voluntary - choose stay home days. quite fair. Can't. live providing flu shots older people year much demand it.  Could explain bit infections start showing around 4 weeks in? rest post makes lot sense I'm confused delay data. ""Fixed pandemic"" follow pattern. spread started Midwest. fucking super spreader trump rallies. Yeah, kinda deserved that. USA USA USA best yet she? recall correctly said early October 'within couple weeks' might 20k infections daily, quite November 18k yesterday...  That's France, we're talking Italy Yep, it’s going insane. already decided I’m going Thanksgiving Christmas. also 2 kids’ birthdays coming next couple months. think I’ll get convince family Zoom gathering. gifts picked dropped beforehand porch. It’s worth it. US Yeah hope work out. I’m Aus always worst thing think about. 

Good luck. It’s US Yeah, place looking well. one went others I've seen usually people standing leaat 3 feet/1m other.

Also believe I've seen single person without mask. Additionally wind strong Slovakia today tents outdoor testing sites look like they're almost fall over. think risk getting infected lines smaller plenty places.  U A, U A! I've felt way since Bush 43 stole election help far-right ideologues Supreme Court started 20-year-long occupations two different countries never attacked us pursuit profits corporate cronies also dragging us cesspool kidnapping, detention without trial, torture, etc.

And lesser extent, since election Reagan 1980. I'm fine though really. fine. cases high test much! america tests much! —djt Best luck. phone check ins thank god. Started anxiety medication helping, anxiety curbed I’m bored there’s nothing lol Correct, intention, overlooked I'm mostly looking present. Cumulative US surpassed Sweden well. Belgium almost 1000 deaths per million. (and surpass weekend). Lies, heard wh ended pandemic instant another.
/s widespread testing there? secret? Tell guy telling 20 years ago Maybe vaccine Well still think everyone wearing masks. take much hospitals get overrun, two. 70/30 right people wearing masks not. stores restaurants enforcing it; totally choice. surprising look Instagram - every American person follow loving like nothing’s going on. Meanwhile we’re Canada haven’t seen friends months (in EU). Belgium's strongest growing country Europe incedence people laughing off. summer barely cases people freedom back. people want go back we're racking cases 10x first peak (in april 2350 cases day peak early september). Cities people wearing masks social distancing. We're headed shitshow. Eh, tracing pretty useless time now. Health Services pretty much given tracing now, even couple weeks ago, quarter infections could traced back origin. sure element existed. fact, bet mom bitched back day. However ask she’ll claim didn’t. know better. live? Sunset’s half four Maybe give credit government trying find way avoid lockdown. test low sensitivity

Are better test right now? No, not.

Sensitivity problem. pilot testing done last week 4 regions 140k people 4% positivity rate meaning 4% active virus. Based research herd immunity France Sweden ~12% antibodies virus hardest hit areas. means expected sensitivity least 33 percent. (much bigger problem might specificity). R0 1.4 could reduced least 33% bellow 1.0.  think they're implying there's age life matter anymore.

Torch nursing homes, say! ^/s Happy Halloween you! makes sense people Covid USA.  may lose incentive based happens Tuesday night. think lot running things ground trying suck certain leader. sorry :( recap, one spineless shitty plain shitty?  Dude, Antarctica exist. That's bigfoot lives. book smart totally lack common sense understanding mortality. get it. I'm commenting Aussie I'm looking infections guys seems much higher first time (when lock down) Borris putting potentially next week? truly boggles mind. enough. mom high risk person get flu shot every year past 8 years year ran unable get one. Awesome vulnerable people get shafted this. amazing thing theories apply ounce logic backfire quickly. 

Like Bid Laden still alive, heck hasn’t steak salesman hunting last three years? Don. Jr. disagrees  Fake news!!!! trump administration cured covid , saw fox news!!! /s Honestly health care system lack one truely scary. “It is” - Mr. Orange pandemic easy anywhere. citizens West brace winter largely confined homes, retirees throng bars, streets Taipei busy restaurants full. United States outliers badly managed pandemic, managing sacrifice public health tank economies extent may affect global balance power lifetimes. exceptionalism. Infectious diseases viewed developing-world problem West outgrown. underfunded neglected pandemic response. Many leaders influential people inappropriate lack alarm grasped fairytales minimised threat virus, kind false sense invulnerability people sheltered fear things. ""Facts care feelings!"" Both. mean way you’re saying, blind would literally escort places haha it’s good word watch baby animal documentaries buddy comedies days. Anything beyond much. best way shut conservatives say:

Okay, okay, let's Sweden. agree. Raise taxes 30% everyone. Let's pay 80% people's sick leaves day 1 day 14. day 14, require doctor's note continue pay sick leave. Let's also make illegal fire anyone feeling little weather. let's also pay parents stay home able work (or get unemployment allowance sick kid) kids (up age 11) little runny roses cannot go school/kindergarten. 

Further more, let taxes pay third companies put employees short-time leave 80% instead firing them. 

On top that: let's forget make testing free hospital care cost 130$ *a year* medicine cannot cost 265$ year. more, pay it. 

Let's like Sweden! Jesus fuck, news? [That'd explain America's infection see Douglas Adams, upvote. 3-4k dead per day incoming soon. Unfortunately! Unnecessarily! clear, responsibility care home workers decide patient needs hospital care not. decided doctors case case basis. doctor’s usually geriatric specialists knowledge patients history. However COVID-19 new disease undoubtedly mistakes made. 

As mentioned elsewhere accusations investigated new information yet. 

Initially [Health Social Care looked 1700 care homes selected 90 investigate since represented 70 percent deaths care homes. focus review investigate whether patients living country's special housing elderly, ongoing pandemic, receive individual assessment doctor receive care treatment accordance review shows residents large extent meet needs care treatment. regions shifted care capacity form access mobile teams, expanded assignments advanced healthcare home increased access medical contacts residents, daytime on-call time. However, interviews, together data sources, show number indicators risks taken assess conditions individual assessment treatment generally relatively good, situation improved course pandemic. small number municipalities homes received indication care treatment always carried correctly significant risk be, says Sofia Wallström, Director General IVO. really wish was. title bit misleading. really mean say “Europe surpassed United States **seven day average** Covid deaths.

Your title make seem total deaths since beginning. It’s not. all. even close. Soon shall burned. West failed. shall go great fire, shall ended. 

*Denethor* got COVID live family literally give shit inviting people, going around friends' houses...etc

Especially surge we're France right now, fucking course one get sick. 2000 yet. Pal. Yes actually. problem fact? ignorant realize level social interaction across country right dangerous literally kill people? sure 'Opinion' column, b/c downright fact. guess editors wanted cover asses. Parents also refusing tests now. toddlers kindergarten kids coming almost parent wanted get tested. kids quarantine obviously parents going leave 2yo home alone go grocery shopping. play Devil's advocate, one person arsehole mean everybody arseholes think overestimating control. Many Chinese use firewalls pic uploaded international website there's way get back. hate Sweden ? know covid while. Locking every month aint sustainable. Riots Spain, Italy England happy either. 


In terms death rate per 100 000, several countries passed us last 2 months. OP, one two weeks infection symptoms show up, another week condition worsens might require medical intervention. Seems like 4 weeks lot slow burn virus. I'm curious see results. makes orders enforce. That's basic function justice system. lol, escorts? mean think  similar carnaval event Sint-truiden. became one worst hit towns europe. town small, problems hospital. Lets bet then. Fl GA prematurely opened Trumo said shutdowns = disloyalty. loses, reasoning loyal testing rates pretty stable last weeks, new cases increasing, amount conducted tests steady.... get point February we'll get hear ""Omg, Biden anything? let 300,000 Americans die cases still rising.""

It would funny sad situation working significant portion population. doctor may offer telehealth visits. best. disappear, right find last marble. lost back May, seen anywhere? awful hard thing go proud it. Get life let continue trash are. say U.S. cases, deaths world? Big numbers! 100.000 win backpack. Shame next general election far away Cops always existed protect property much else. We’re gonna die. Hook worms fault, I'd say. thing, really. Oh, didn’t think look perspective. Mortality rate coming down, that’s true. totally agree, shits smear fan again. No, would not, people risk economy driving consumers, mostly old people underlying diseases. Yeah pretty clear businesses run country give fuck. Alright, I'll remove it. realize haha.

^(You opt replying ""backtickopt6"" comment) That's said FWIW, here’s guidance shared slack channel Stockholm office:

```
New guidelines Stockholm since yesterday Nov 19th (rough translation)

From 29 October, everyone staying counties Stockholm, Västra Götaland Östergötland invited to:
• Refrain staying indoor environments shops, malls, museums, libraries, bathhouses gyms. Necessary visits to, example, grocery stores pharmacies made.
• Refrain participating in, example, meetings, concerts, performances, sports training, matches competitions. However, apply sports training children young people born 2005 later.
• possible, avoid physical contact people live with. This means, among things, dissuasion arranging participating party similar social gathering.

Necessary close contact, care visits medical examinations, covered council. However, important keep mind anyone symptoms may covid-19 avoid close contact others.

The decision also includes stricter general guidelines activities - shops, shopping centers sports facilities - workplaces counties Stockholm, Västra Götaland Östergötland:
• activities take measures everyone follow general advice event local outbreaks covid-19. This may, example, mean business minimizes number visitors time.
• Employers take steps enable employees follow general guidelines local outbreaks covid-19. These measures encouraging staff work home, offering increased conditions working home postponing business trips, conferences physical meetings.
``` lockdown also longer announced right now. took us 2 months get numbers 7.000 daily cases 300 cases summer. lockdown start monday, number normally rise 2 weeks restrictons active. Right now, way higher numbers, many people dont care social distancing anymore almost winter. 

i guarantee, start december numbers lower right now, even close low enough open back up. politic say, lock atleast christmas, want celebrate christmas right?

But something cant tell people anymore, tell straight away lockdown 2 months again, many wont comply anymore. start moving goalposts again.

But thing pisses dont plan numbers low again. open like last time, cases rise sharply again. cant stay locked longer time anymore, otherwise many people lose jobs existence. last lockdown. whole family got weeks ago, including myself, 92 year old father law bone cancer, dad leukemia, sister cerebral palsy, 70 year old mother law. fine, one needed put ventilator hospitalized anything. symptoms. Whois virus actually killing? know it’s anecdotal evidence couldn’t help think “this it...?” lol blaming govt citizens refuse cooperate fact UK US similar things like know we're related. knows what’s going happen? ones accurate predicting virus since January 23rd Wuhan shut down. 

We’re constantly least one step behind estimating happen. Honestly, thought US would strong response, get PPE going lead world. tons transmit. people transmit virus likely it'll infect someone complication. ton asymptomatic tracing becomes futile well. leads conditions lock becomes answer avoid filling hospitals. Yea. I'm truly worried upcoming weeks. I'm expecting triage European countries.. ""Turning corner."" like think rational, sane people see really is. 

Going fucking circles apparent end sight. may back normal indirectly actions (partying, going big crowds) may kill someone put young person months covid fatigue. What's hard common sense? joke, one Jordan Klepper videos, guy blames Obama anything stop 9/11. said probably playing golf. 🙄 Next Tuesday's episode pretty interesting say least Yeah, IFR still better benchmark ""How many infections lead death"" taking raw deaths/total cases. Making another dolphin virus us. lagging far enough behind see provinces like Ontario BC already different trajectory Europe. Current spread started reopening, widely. Speaking family Europe, roughly time BC couple weeks earlier ONT, widely VASTLY different. 

Then top off, 900 cases day province 15M people, government closes indoor dining hotspots. 2-3 weeks later, see first EU countries so. We’ve actually quicker response scenarios, bar Alberta expect conservative country. Look countries Asia adopt almost 100% mask usage none shut down. selfish self centered entitlement fucking us hard. Sweden large death rate relative small population shining example do. Thus thread gives hope. guess Ive facebook much arguing coronaidiots science deniers. Strong point making, care give arguments think that? Every time see this, brainless talking tbh. Would refreshing actually see valid point made. Damn Hey, knock it. got go away stick, I'm public follow CDC guidelines keep things short possible. Wait, mum says possible two viruses time Ahh...I shouldn’t laugh. did. Take upvote. First people complain there’s one already

Then complain it’s rushed 


I want pick one Admin gave up. want herd immunity now, even though reinfections. Yes, tough. Trump running America like businesses, ground, literally. bodies come go. long eyes trump, happy finger pointing. doesn’t pay American population paying mistakes enabling mans ego trip. Damn depends high temperature is. 104 supposed go ER. dad cusp exceeding temperature covid called hotline first. (This UK though know procedure US) Spooks Wait, restaurants allowing dine-in right now? stupid?! remember bit later government welding people inside homes (not sure true not) thinking virus already way via plane. Potatoes cabbage Would intresting number average contacts person EU, USA, China, south Korea Australia (befor pandamic).

I mean, that's huge factor dont know diffrent propaply is. election day cases quarantining two weeks, testing consummation, afterwords days later? keep friends safe? share source? ayee send patients Austria then🤝

Yeah slightly sarcastic. mean cooperation worked quite good start year time much serious. think even though cases got less serious months France already crossed point return second wave. weeks hospitals flooded compare numbers numbers first wave. difficult situation ee take patients many die, hospitals full eith french people German citizen get bed. oblivion part made laugh. Maybe cool getting easily offended “We rounding corner beautifully”

A self-proclaimed stable genius. can’t stupid... that’s 2.22% death rate Unlike sci-fi movies, whole continent got right. asking question. though, right that. tests must getting good. I'm pretty much back normal phoenix. thing can't go see movie, bother all. heart goes people left house apartment since March, that's gotta super rough.

Going football/halloween party tonight, even. mean, Texas 29 million people shy 1 million total cases another two years ....have heard opioid epidemic? know strangers internet good metric, agree staying home way. halloween's gonna rough cases, I'm glad one them. least aren’t denying virus exists kills people. That’s step forward. Starting Soleimani January, Financial crisis March, Protests throughout June, July, August pandemic wrapping around There’s literally way explain give shit people. Oh idk anybody it. Must real. Probably power grab . . . Jews? /s


 hate people much. bad virus kills without discrimination. Turns idiots uniquely American trait. knew? China implemented Nationwide quarantine, would hit 1 US keeps current slow pace, soon achieve goal China failed.

Big oof. personally article much black w hite thinking. mindset ""numbers rising , someone messed "" toxic fuck get anywhere. 
I mean surprising countries experience fighting epedemics better global pandemic countries going blind ? really . geographic isolated living close equader helps to. Back office seems better days. real easy, remember, worse insult fling someone, love em Many fools think can't look history. Excuses excuses Sadly think pandemic fatigue. People can’t keep forever. okay doh? can’t wait. neurosis every day past ten eleven months absolutle hell earth me. time wake go bed I’m terrified catching giving son wife. ruined quality life ability ever calm. lot good testing time I'll entertain point anyway

Yes were. Comparative many nations time were. again. Awful strange trying refute point midst everything else. simple facts sliding control much Europe, England included. matter much, ""oh testing less then"" claims throw change fact lower reported number back led lockdown isn't. knew could it!

😢 much America afford say, isolate hotel week?  Holy fuck. Belgium tiny. Numbers like insane. US readers, basically taking population Ohio stuffing space half size West Virginia. know regional comparisons would make sense, since know who's familiar where. One five idiot. Good news really, thought them. Japan, Korea Taiwan openly capitalist countries sure you’re making connection capitalism lack government intervention. I've read insane comments tops all. Behaved responsible? talking US, country politically split 50/50. guarantee regardless issue half us agree  hometown? way check data see honest. suppose since many US politicians say it, proof enough. Exactly, good wording here. GOVERNMENT use it. fault everyday citizen high officials say shit like covid flu, covid real, covid chinese hoax. parties us. going take kids houses close friends trust head home movies. Hopefully retirements make room others get jobs. Two Americas. Machine learning medicine definitely play increasingly important role! There's lot ways collect large amount data body indicate disease. 

There projects diagnosing categorizing arthritis/other joint issues sound make. 
 
There projects detecting epileptic seizure happen (I think ~30 minutes ahead time algorithms usually get it) based brain activity measured electrodes 

Of course, one big ones automated heart disease detection wearable tech watch 

I read one, seen articles airport dogs supposedly detect someone COVID, know there's lot machine learning projects determining different food items based scent. Maybe future diagnosed machine smells you! time long ago university work 64% positivity rate. testing symptomatic cases. mean, I'm personally lot measures we've made bail entities mentioned. Historically, banks put situations needed bailing of, hand housing bubble, like last one(s?); airlines supposedly mishandled profits buying stock instead sort preparation mind, even mild ones might helped weeks, case, bankruptcy remove them, would hand property someone willing take work it; given specialized nature infrastructure required functional airline need air travel modern world sake punctuality, new buyers would unlikely change business itself.

Rambling aside point, know enough volatility landlord, know information would inherently play large role opinion bailed out; enter volatile market income, need backup plan involves something stable, still work shit job makes crazy demands know stable, passable income hardly wavered even pandemic(thankfully). feel like body, corporate, governing, whathaveyou, still actively trying put undue cost housing right getting picture here; utilities something I'm comfortable arguing, terms property taxes things explicitly targeted billing people roof head, needs definitely leeway landlords deal either right now.

Wow, response got long. admit may lost point somewhere it, case, please let know I'll try concise. perfect storm terrible leadership, yes, ""individualism"" ""exceptionalism"". 

As US citizen living Asia, cannot fathom people back home politicize something simple wearing god damn mask. country live handling pandemic mediocre manner-about 7k deaths, kudos people adding government's incompetence refusing follow social distancing mask wearing. Hell, government even requires us wear face shield enclosed public places, makes everyone look ridiculous people compliant, nonetheless.

I still believe West best position rise though, given years progress institutional strength. also think vaccine developed say, Astra still reliable. This.

These problems always present, took rather incompetent leadership expose all. really sad.  Here's hoping fixed somehow. (Probably take years decades) Nowhere perfect. west gets hurt pandemic doubt. also individual freedoms. would rather live west China, irrespective covid. like use word ""we"" here. No, ""we"" handle poorly - people like probably wore masks, kept 2 meters stayed home. ""We"" everything could here. need stop ""them"", whatever means, spreading bullshit hoaxes anything. Social media need responsible shit, what's influencing masses, turn influences governments. could done better. acted earlier, shut would needed last four weeks. I'm casting stones here, president country advocating 'herd immunity' without understanding concept. take account Brazil ? humid county generally go 60F 

They still racked lot cases. Incivility, apparently. listen Australian friends Facebook, Dan Andrew’s singlehandedly turned Australia fascist state. don’t listen Australian friends. likely lose care enough sign another stimulus?

yes, he'll steal part use part pay ""friends"" like first one. donate Red Cross? We'll 200k/day soon enough. Welcome America - can't work bills pay. Can't afford get sick hospital bills high encourages people ""press thru it"". Owners small business can't close margins already razor thin lot them. Meanwhile, literal billionaires gained trillion dollars worth wealth time. due decades defunding education, populace who's stupid something it. We're fucked here, country many problems. Hey please go back old normal? Back 2019 people would behaved responsibly.  fair government entity power actually control emergency situation, pretty much lost. evictions allowed back spring summer , we'd probably even worse off. *FDA It’s 6 months since I’ve sex wife. decided wasn’t safe, couldn’t fathom endangering friends family satisfy selfish needs. I’m sure much longer it. know things get better Biden elected asks people wear masks, don’t think go another couple months. Why? seems like seeing multiple biggest one day increases record lately. going something it? Wait wasn’t point nervous hitting 30K day? Neoliberalism failing It’s kinda like passing healthcare law calling result “affordable”. think truthful forthright, need re-evaluate life choices. Show group. Give example group is
""obsessed rising case numbers exclusion every metric.""

A website, commercial anything do. want see it. great results far !! know least one family quarantined two weeks going protest. Like, went got two weeks' groceries marching go all. 

I know others recently who've isolated three four days protest, gotten test. Although seems region-dependent. people live places that, others live places tests hard get, long turn-around time. Protests, riots? Yet.... test round. beefier version coming vaccine! That's actually think. Ooooe tracker coming vaccine Yeah, stop testing, cases go down. brilliant

(/s) People always need vote, matter what.

The ""vOtInG mAtTeR"" rhetoric false outdated. Yeah, everyone I’ve seen personally seen photos near 100%. Yeah sister bunch parenting groups she’s talking weeks! cannot believe unbelievably selfish stupid being. going hardcore lockdown house, again, kind crap.

The thing going year groceries dr appointments won’t even that. 🙄 Lol. nonsense. Estimates versus reality. problem publishing nonsense.  It’s happening Arizona many people decided wasn’t problem was. there’s panic places. think areas like NY already hard hit whose leaders took seriously first wave fare much better see less panic buying before, though doesn’t exclude places healthcare systems overwhelmed. starts economy civil society untill 12:00, 828,518 people tested, 7,947 people positive, one percent!! Yea, much safer around bunch people enclosed spaces without knowing contact they've prior presence.

Having family knows exactly isolated together choose muuuuch dangerous. 

/s work logistics. I've spent share time places like Shenzhen, Hangzhou, Guangzhou. overwhelming majority Chinese contacts US educated. I've also toured share Chinese manufacturing facilities. little based stolen, Western intellectual property. Stealing people's ideas ingrained Chinese culture even institutions higher learning acknowledge plagiarism serious problem. What's really worrying China take close look anything, feels sketchy hell, everything giant house cards ridiculously uneven number young males, females, large, aging population. serious recipe drastic instability, increasingly clamped dissent. Lol. Facts. 

I love Republicans call dems snowflakes. Republicans pussies. Anecdata, friends self-isolated protest, mask-usage protest near 100%. uptick cases afterward. always turning corner running circles. Stanford study. Lemme guess protests led 0 cases 0 deaths I’m aware anyone government currently calling “shutdown.” complete straw man argument.  go around world world flat? UN conspiracies around forever. People talking kid 80s.

Come UN. Get shit together.  Wuhan, Italy. can't what? USA number 1! Number 1! Number 1!

Number 1 deliberately killing people. would need 500,000-600,000 cases day. suppose it’s possible seems unlikely. CNN editors need pun ished headline composition choices That's true all. plenty protesters wore masks. 100M/330M Americans absolutely love 

Your numbers way Eventually, breaks well-educated population perceive follow government orders. freedom (or power) comes responsibilities. countries almost 0 cases think ""letting be"" eventually impact longer run. math.

230,000 dead US alone. disease 99.9999% survival rate, would mean 230 billion (that's billion ""b"") would caught 230,000 died it.

I see math strong suit. doesn’t account exponential growth, exponential growth means speed case numbers go gets faster faster something interferes virus’s ability transmit Parroting health officer briefings. Dakota: 47%

!!! rallies... Hahaha that's beautiful :-D 


(yes mistranslation lol) Thanks extensive informative response. I'm Netherlands say response described. 

Closing borders within EU difficult, physically legally. need cross border logistics almost everything. Cross border infections serious cause infections EU. Making hard country choose full lockdown. even manage eradicate virus, open they'll quickly import neighbouring countries.

What seems problem second wave hit harder faster anticipated. rise number cases anticipated, speed surprising. Even though opened up, society nowhere near normal. I've working home since first lockdown seen colleagues times end summer. Restaurants open, restrictions. still second wave coming fast maybe even faster first. 

There's lot said European response pandemic. we're genuinely struggling, due lack preparation, due lack information experience, really tough problem. 

In way, one hardest types pandemics one have. spreads fast, making window opportunity fight small. disease, serious, people. gives room discussion people making risk assessment. makes policy acceptance problem. 

As crises, combination issues makes big. Thanks reply. know sure fully believe in. One side spectrum people say big deal like majority family. half saying said. disease fully understand.

 me, believe something shouldnt taken lightly many people lasting effects. told family member 90 something percent chance survival, doesnt mean would okay getting covid. Goddamn idiots appreciate cited response. Truly. one said anything like protests much larger comparison...? feel like we’re watching fall super power. honestly don’t know America could even slow spread point, every month it’s hand. I’m religious, I’m hoping god vaccine soon. America world large really needs it. CA. hear stories rest country feel like we’re living two separate realities. zombie movies accurate. got stupid. I’m 40 IQ smoothbrain

Considering taking post face value seeing lick irony within it, yes, I'd say likely hypothesis. 
Don't worry, judging replies among peers. Chinese government literally test entire population city soon find single case. Even don’t collectively know every test, sure people China keeping track it. virus talking about? Trump's rounding curve comment covid last debate week half ago sure aging like dogshit sun. faith-based camp. believed expertise facts could observe senses, there, COVID no. Thank you, appreciate apology. They're mostly getting tested too. real numbers surely higher People already panic buying, hate folks. Lmao clearly read bible. 

John 5:19

Need more?  Yup, Trump 2024, hopefully Eric. ""Fear-mongering"" scientific value. 

If doctor tells obesity puts risk high blood pressure heart disease, fact, fear-mongering. 

900+ Covid deaths per day America. That's fact. person deals emotionally subjective.

Yes hope yes treatments theraputics developing. Systemic racism police violence major public health issues. Idk.... lot people willing catch covid die rallies Australia, china, south Korea, New Zealand managing.

Why? Hard lockdowns burn contract tracing, targeted testing enforcing quarantine.

The US suffering nonsense never locked hard. viewed Chinese response heavy handed enforce basic quarantines. try tell earth flat... Well going dramatically wel Good work keep up! preprint? reached December 2020 yet? asymptomatic immune. Yes, can. President Cleveland (so far) one hold office two non-consecutive terms, though. It’s exactly that, poverty levels amount melatonin skin. kind like economic, social mental damage worth trying stop virus serious issue mutated common cold. again, science testing reduced near zero. probably safer home family honest. No. working paper. money boah 💵 Yeah, got put antibiotics 10 days told take couple painkillers. longest corner I’ve ever seen. feels like circle really. Pandemic isn’t over. reaches Australia New Zealand starts spreading could easily spike there, too. look location US. area 15 cases months. 3,000. don’t think happen does. 

I guess plan isolate vaccine developed widely deployed. knows I’d love see studied detail.

Same. There’s like 75,000 ICU beds country remember 1) People ICU beds many reasons COVID much capacity already “in use” 2) outbreaks local/regional hospitals deep trouble others ok. Hey man, don’t think it’s hoax. believe there’s virus there. I’ve looked try understand, questions have. instance, state recently switched John Hopkins reporting methodology. health department worker sent internal email county commissioners got leaked mentioned causing spike cases due switch reporting methodology. including probable cases positive cases. email verified real agency auditing her. graphs, two days email leaked there’s spike corona cases. went higher ever before. news never explains like that. ‘cases surge schools start again.’ 

And start study PCR test 40-45 cycles whatever, gets weird. 

I wear mask anywhere go. coworker corona near forty hours didn’t catch it. 

Just take vitamin you’ll fine. Weeks ago dick (short district) manager said guests using much hand sanitizer. I'm sorry what? Mortality rate corona people 50: 0.1% less 

Probability dying turn playing Russian roulette: 16.66%

Yeah, 16.66% = 0.1%. Exact thing capitalism this? It’s wearing masks socially distancing, sanitizing addition outside, lack trump rallies, main commander actually ends infertile well, wife sets handmaid (Offred) sex Eye guy conceive husband would stop bang handmaid. 

Him infertile coincidence though mainly men fine, women not. Entire households (2-5 ppl) go time, there's reason distance. There's large gap group tho. Yes can. 80% African Americans USA vitamin deficient. 

I taught lesson middle schoolers equator, sun, skin color directly related this. 

Correlation \= Causation Please don’t go crazy I’ve trying keep nose news coronavirus, still enacting part mask wearing staying home unless absolutely get something. said, everyone talks replies “it’s less deadly flu, life go on” true? yeah never knew crazy immune responses covid came along. Sometimes immune system much fire power ends burning whole house along wanted stop intruder guess thats model predicted 2.4 millions Americans would die whole country go lockdown right. now.. don’t understand people count every European nation individually add States together one. Thanks calling out. assure you, ate bats. Yes, hope stop forcing people test time. It’s going away, test people want test, also allow people reject contact traced, point virus stay forever. classic thing response . Yet acknowledging study looking . India 3.7x population US (roughly), yet we’ve topped record....Mercia! Well, could possibly go wrong that? 

People literally said, right face, ""kids get COVID.""

The absolute conviction people reject science, also rationality sensibility, breathtaking. 

They deserve suffering coming way. Richly. Uk waited till last minute France seemed waited till last minute. 50k cases yesterday 500 deaths France went lockdown. Starting wonder done purpose wait till last minute maybe. lockdown early people say needed cases low better justify lockdown needed. mean like cold virus? Yes, almost million cases untold dead. 👏

Brilliant. I’m convinced Vitamin-D saved life. diagnosed deficiency couple years ago, take prescription. grandma died Covid, really knew was, death bed. got violently sick day passed, recovered 4 days. I’d read triage Vitamin C doctors China, put family heavy supplements ever since. Depends state, many emergency absentee ballots people who, example, end hospitalized within days election may also apply people ordered isolate state health authorities. best virus best administration. camp settings Covid spread like wildfire within days.  find hard believe adults. lot dead infected SNFs. Morbidly, worse gets break news, easier going me. THINK hold me, sure. something worry top everything else. time stood science White House also said anything try curtail virus anymore. Fuck country, fuck people elected asshole continue support him. hope anyone here. evil. happened ten commandments? shall murder? ""christian"" itching start shooting Gods children using Bible reasoning. public official paid tax dollars!

Keep Voting hope sarcastic comment. 8%? White people learned nothing bubonic plague centuries ago. think idea cases develop severe shed way virus pre-symptomatic phase. Influenza going strong hundred years. got really case flu (likely) summer pneumonia tough time breathing normally weeks afterward. Im 32. found wasnt covid scared get soon would higher risk. even gives shit whats happening China anymore? rest world reporting thousands cases day. Fuck China 2022 state wide elections Texas, suspect people political party sent packing, perhaps even prison  Well, people act like nothing happening. masks worn. Good you, would really love get vaccinated would many people here. literally joke make simpsons, probably reading satire, ffs. Duterte handling things there? Yes, I'm fully behind statement. Good bot. Every person small piece 300 million piece puzzle one guy going make wear mask stop working feed families. ones ourselves. think ""government' magical entity group people trying find solutions need re-think capable of. US people fully capable wearing masks. also fully capable completely oblivious pay attention news media what's going taking serious enough. even US military could make everybody wear mask sit home starve 2 weeks. circumstance right best case scenario. could easily another depression optimism economy president. Lots alcohol top suppress immune systems. find big cardboard boxes behind furniture appliance stores... /S Sounds like Simpsons character like truck drivers chime medical professionals trump uses this?

America? Never! [Bonjour cheese-eating surrender Yet, people would lose ducking mines wearing clothes became optional Thank you. smart, safe encouraging others best way respect frontlines.  lot things better white people segregated.

I laugh every time see advice hold thanksgiving dinner outside. Grandma going sit breeze hour 32 degree weather. would turn cushiest activities endurance event. Sweden done worse U.S. much rest Western Europe w/o masks destroying economy. we. 0 confirmed cases covid among dolphins right kinda like hitting iceberg telling passengers ship little hole may help.

A [rough Ourworldindata CFR testing show much difference, though.

It's Finlands cases go much. Maybe form autumn immune status hiding second wave longer, know. much personal freedom!? thing happened summer camp! 25 years ago crabs....... articles posted reddit December. Mayhap door screener? I'll volunteer. suggesting West's response sophistication Neandertal. 

He's providing supporting evidence. It’s hard empathize many people choose wear masks contribute problem. I’m sorry can’t feel anything people stupid. I’m sure relate better. Lol yeah right expecting lock downs happen pattern seeing viral spread looks like, thought would may back March Yeah, costs around 70€ get tested live, unless absolute emergency, sadly  countries Europe handled things differently first second wave. Gonna need source Maine 100 day first time ever dw, we're way share idiots too. Seen parties, 10 cars pulled outside houses etc. Republicans make 40% fits narrative Biden win. made good point would head task force do? using Obama's name overlook Trump? overconfident provided wrong answer. 

It's incorrect decision prioritize 1% population 99%. 

I saw study saying Women lost job cut hours disproportionately men. protecting 70 year old obese important gender equality? lost jobs can't afford medical treatment, rent, etc? know rest you, I'm getting tired winning. live Nova Scotia Canada... currently less 5 cases... it’s way months - businesses operating per normal - sanitize hands go wear mask indoors... much fear spreading here. skepticism based exactly? benefits report hiking ? wonder could love monger. ""Mission Achomlished"" fired attitude? area without free testing? state/county several drive events weekly free go several drugstores get done free, too. drive thru events really increased community’s testing numbers especially lately. oklahoma history mention Tulsa race riots made Land run sound super fun little mention impacted native Americans already dislocated forced live oklahoma. president said beat it? wife 4+ years retirement plans cancelled. wintering florida, RV trips, shopping, movies, shows, plays, concerts, eating out, backyard parties.

Donald Trump killing Americans Gotcha thanks. find interesting initial reports China. doctors ground watching diseases months. found transmission almost often people knew lived together. stranger transmission primary mechanism spread, spread families.

But China people strong collective consciousness. follow rules get shamed viciously much worse. USA, exist 50 years. people whatever want. point being, collectivist culture, disease nipped bud. basically impossible since one wants follow rules all. Freedom trumps safety lot people USA. May vaccine us. always favor people dying country. Trims away stupid. Wouldn’t severe/symptomatic cases lead less spread?? 🤔🤔🤔 Tell fellow Filipinos. 

The general public country starting get lax tired mandatory face mask, face shield, social distancing measures. People starting social gatherings despite increasing number cases.

Even tourist hotspots starting open despite onset colder weather.

How wish like East Asians discipline.  alone remember great nurses support workers.  hero’s wear capes, lot wear scrubs. 21,897 infections really. I'm critical care nurse practitioner. make ICU anywhere to. find, rent buy ventilators, turns hallways makeshift ICU, turn regular units ICUs, without nurses staff beds useless. guy mentioned death toll break 1 million got downvoted, we've surpassed that. Look, checked profile know interested information, nice try though Ahhhh. Nice round numbers. Keeping math simple. Like school shootings, worst record next one Yeah US fucked. Hope people vote days Brilliant. I'm stealing this. would direct democracy. democracies representative democracies.

If i'm stupid please laugh me. Seems like good guy probably great father. Wonder prediction worked 🤓 Massachusetts rising cases too
1500 yesterday 😞 Im gonna honest, numbers don’t mean lot hardly leave house. could say 1 million cases day would still shrug. many people getting it, where’s share?

No sense empathy, solidarity, patriotism civic responsibility. Got it. wife back office medical. building surgery center. also stopped temperature checks cases rising gone self monitor .  I'll know I'm feeling depressed. amazing job stop flu, terrible job stop Covid?

Doesnt *still* mean people die Covid, would dying flu year measures? Yeah criticism Trump going result people flooding defend obfuscate. doesn’t matter heinous actions criticism literal science. It’ll happen matter Huh, anti-T comments posts removed; can’t believe proves impartial point made deleted comment. (It sides blame, comment section refuses acknowledge that). due diligence suppose. Implying collectively decide we've enough virus, it'll go away? Lmao people thinking I'm comparing US blind. I'm taking India here, read comment slowly comprehend it. see word US this, they're using cheaper tests reliable.

NUMBER 1, BABY control know done now. Track-and-trace useless. Shutdowns again? know. Right that's totally valid, criticising another commenter put ""freedumb"" anti-mask idiots. sure context, totally agree that. careful China _literally_ using argument freedom concept.

And think China right thing here. US handled terribly. super careful ""freedom = bad"" China literally using crisis America's utter fuck push message democracy work, world could look China alternative.

I live neighbouring Asian country also undemocratic, albeit totalitarian. Like many neighbouring Asian countries, lot dependence China. dangerous message, one China working hard now, democracy may necessary success nation economic growth, may even negative... even contrary ""Asian values"".

Pompeo like means represent American people. speak minority ruling class interest groups behind it. matter carry bragging, facts make laughing stock. would like ask you, friends press, convey message American politicians: away arrogance bias towards China, spare thought American people's well-being, work harder fix problems actually agree everything he's saying response Covid. China done better there, followed science *in regard specifically* think China model follow. China actively using disparage democracy freedom political idea, need keep mind joking it.  following rules then? problem US never ebb cases like places. We’ve stayed consistently red, we’re moving leg higher. hit 100k cases 24 hours yesterday, much ahead predicted schedule. We’re heading fast direction pandemic “over.” One 5 Americans believe depopulation scheme. 

One 5 Americans believe democrat scheme make trump look bad.

One 5 Americans believe artificially made China destroy US.

One 5 Americans believe Bill Gates made get us microchiped. 

One 5 Americans think scientists made keep children masks kidnapped easier.

One 5 Americans believe virus make us sheep government see much freedom give up.

Four 5 Americans believe above.

One 5 Americans dumb rocks. Brantlynn Lol downvoted.

I work phone company. 10% calls something related emergency alerts, involve elderly want get rid Pip pip da doodly doo stricter testing requirements back March/April.. Please, continue keep yourself. AMF. actually study this, multiple ones. search studies, it’ll show Covid probably spread little bit protests, wasn’t mass jump numbers like this. Take NYC example. We’re getting back rising Covid cases end May couple weeks June, people general also protesting, didn’t spike cases. 

There also lot mask usage protests. lot rally’s. People also move protests, lot weren’t standing one spot hour time. Little things like drastically decrease chances catching Covid. That’s patently false. see exact trend cases deaths try explain people saying bad USA is. Yes it’s bad Europe hit way harder time around.  Ugh. Well I’m Ohio, “Florida north” 😂  already made point. chose focus number monarchies relevant

Risky behavior? Sitting unmasked parked vehicle book camera crew standing ad? scary dangerous firearm? Let’s clutch pearls here. mean fair it’s really big elsewhere Covid 3rd leading cause death US (much higher car crashes.) abandon eliminating new causes death rein, lord Dipshitius? Record number total recovered well... ""As United States adds new coronavirus case every second, hospitals West Texas Wisconsin overwhelmed soaring number critically ill find interesting number people without symptoms. shows much undertesting first wave.

Does anyone explanation deaths still quite stable increases minimally. certain demographic hit harder? don’t know region, many parts state schools didn’t even resume in-person learning last week September. virtual first part school year. within 3 weeks in-person started shut individual schools due positive tests. sure getting here. risk factor present Europe Middle East, absent East Asia Africa. however present admixed Americans. 

With african americans however think socio-economical factors better explain disproportionate severity disease.  US bad! US, ""The West"", West (let's ignore latin america), silence. really wonder many cases deaths take Trump administration actually admit problem. Instead mission accomplished problem gets worse. Hope u guys flatten curve. europe also going well. Monday there's soft lockdown Germany. meeting people private restaurants, fitness, cinemas, etc. wait...it's depopulation plan kill 0.4ish% population? So, like really, really unambitious Thanos?

""There 100 individuals room. Half die!""

""Half us die!?""

""Oh, no, sorry, mean half one individual. Actually, little less half, actually. Well, pretty much mean Jim's leg go sleep minutes."" 

EDIT: realize death toll covid horrible, 0.4% entire Earth would 31 million people. saying sucks depopulation tool. *breathes slowly*

K thanks that. know past indicators arenot guarantee future, people gonna people, barring significant change social behavior.... Heres article spread COVID-19 protests summer, hope  Lol 🤣🤣.. wasting life, sad Can't give pay rise clap? matter statement technically true, completely off-topic. Personally mind boggling easy convince Swedes disaster unfolded actually ok others secretly jealous.

Its unreal. lady work tell social experiment see government could control too. get especially mad I'm forced listen work I'm trapped can't talk back I'd love say, ""Yeah shows listens Facebook shitposts listens science..."" specific virus family viruses. vaccine strain influenza immune reaction impact coronavirus, virus, matter. better hope special one know option. got backwards. people getting infected frequently ones follow words.  detached reality? even listen anything guy whose dick suck? Trump, February 28th, called democratic hoax. went later date say wearing mask taking opposition him. POLITICAL SHIT-CUNT PRESIDENT MADE WAY.

WAKE FUCK YA JACKASS. curious... patients transferred nursing home prior this? billions people Im sure theres cases over. thanks. already anecdotes /r/covid19positive people lost sense taste/smell, got back weeks later, another months go ""wrong"". Wrong things would smell/taste like chemicals, oil, rot, etc.  

Also bunch comments regarding hair loss months infection although say typical w viruses. don’t think would benefit anyone less union either advocating federization don’t know issues would dissolve it. general less Union would done better level democracy mandates won’t moving towards one state been. Meanwhile mortality rate lower chickenpox economy crashing burning. Good day! strictly true. live southwest coivd rates significantly lower regions. entertainment suffering. ignorant think everywhere China. Protests happen dude. Fox News fake story. know? That's name new band 4000 day UK?? never happen Honestly don’t know comments like downvoted. People say “well socially distancing protesters wearing masks” okay, still everyone following rule. goes Trump rallies. legitimate information cases caused protests/riot whether cases small large. East: lunatics 

West: don’t know I’ve Liu! Hahaha. asking friend thinks tried crimes humanity handled pandemic real, Poles wearing masks nose? see pictures anywhere else? noticed live-stream Warsaw protest yesterday. fucking circus. even exaggeration, around 50% people wearing masks nose, chin diaper, zero-fucks-given completely smoke middle crowd.

We need put politics aside moment get control. sick reading 'well, government FORCED us protest'. No, didn't, although I'm pro-life also fully agree court decision, nobody's forcing onto street. I'm shocked right many young, presumably educated urbanite Poles seem understand virus transmission. public health emergency, top priority. government health ministry given precise carefully worded directives help control spread virus. no, somehow government's fault pandemic exploding.

These Covid deniers also understand exponential growth going shit pants see numbers week two. swear God, babcia gets sick assholes going fucking rampage. don’t doubt it, right question motives. It’s like asking oil tycoon thinks start stuff limit CO2 emission. Hypothetically, one come COVID Election Day want vote? voted early along many others, many people voted via mail, waiting Election Day vote person? It’s late request absentee ballot now. 

Obviously answer public health perspective stay home, 100,000 new cases yesterday alone, many people haven’t voted yet? That’s insignificant number, especially count new cases 10 days Tuesday. could hundreds thousands people quarantine intended vote. 

Just something thinking standing line vote today! Herd immunity? U. S. A.! U. S. A.! Yeah, except plenty contact researchers China also colleagues gone back forth China due research. China back normal except closed borders, hard quarantines strict mask rules. course they’re fibbing numbers. doesnt’t take away fact don’t active outbreak local spread. think otherwise you’re stupidly grasping whataboitism straw. appreciate post. understand people didn’t learn horror NYC. news. failure country lmao There’s statistical correlation cases &amp; deaths. Sounds weird, it’s true.

You see yourself. overlay chart w/cases &amp; deaths shift cases N-weeks. don’t understand comment. Every elected official every state instituted strict mandates response covid. Maybe haven’t? Go Trump rally, hug people, lick face Neoliberalism things mate. Donald trump neoliberal, sense word. Macron 10 times neoliberal Trump is, never go socialized healthcare, worked expand it. Stop putting Neoliberal “everything goes wrong everything don’t like”. Neoliberal vague ideology anyway it’s strange harp much... Chant ""CCP virus"" 30 times everyday. make disappear. Chant ""Trump"" 30 times time, cured instantly. Probably right-wingers notorious weak, spindly baby-men. households two working parents small kids? aren’t overwhelmed. 

They literally are. Hard get vitamin Hawaii, sorta go way try. Thank hospital work doesnt allow N95s come outside hospital get sick liable. Fuck yank toilet paper went ""aight imma head out"" Yep. 12 person outdoor party. couple hung around people mild symptoms gotten test results back. going around party risks. done anything Halloween themed. even carved pumpkin. I'm writing year off. Australia ain't dictatorship luv What's wild US scientists ones taught lot countries handle it. island

Hmmm

Anyway, unemployment like 20%, kinda need something open economy tourists. swear redditors think governments create wealth thin air. know else truly failed? Chinese creating spreading virus first place. shhh, that's racist. Let's blame West 30th time. Birx lost credibility [she said “He’s attentive scientific literature details data,” Birx said. “I think ability analyze integrate data comes long history business really real benefit discussions medical issues.” headline one five must Americans ? They're thinking rationally, they're thinking emtoionally. ""they're gonna try kill me"" paranoia. Everything disinfected regularly, masks big MUST (people charge yelling idiots ""over nose!""). go week see anything changed. mostly think ""1500 nurses dead pandemic"" would better. number definitly reported. list unforgivable things authorities done massive. It’s infuriating. Since IFR 0.6 1.1 percent actually implies 21 40 million infected US Nope. Tegnell, Sweden's Fauci, shouting rooftops herd immunity never strategy. Sweden restrictions. 

This concept repeatedly debunked; allowing covid run rampant would amount genocide. pregnancies issue? Like tbh use scared STDs Slovakia, country schools open smaller children can't stay home without parents. mostly medical employees work. never happen, MPs voted pay rise majority country became jobless. hate government every heartless brainwashed moron voted Oh look countries strictest lockdown screwed. Meanwhile South Korea Turkmenistan. lockdowns imposed. Currently cases. somebody find article saying lockdowns worked? Maybe stats? looking long time. Haven’t found one. old research, actually. pre-prints line work started May June. I'm going fun investing money working job worked hard made debt name could live comfortably shut down. Wanna compare resumes? Melbourne, cultural issues allowed virus spike near end (3 month) lockdown, got end. 99.9% people right thing.

Most 900 deaths old age homes. people addled thinking begin think deeply, think emotionally. sucks matter careful are, there’s always chance getting something random. right thing, viruses sneaky like that. Wishing guys speedy recovery. concept would feel reach countries land borders infected nations,

We Ireland share land border UK. Northern Ireland (which part UK) 5 times new cases per capita today. I'm sure happens get control that's border closed Well yeah. understand people paying attention unforgivable authorities/doctors/scientists missed failed act time.

Oh well, even complaining? people took months even acknowledge airborne/asymptomatic transmission clear incompetent/devious are. Hey, cross streets! Happy Halloween! ok nurses asked much would get insurance Yeah great point. Might well cut middle man smother grandma ourselves. fool probably copper mesh. Copper known antibacterial, used high-touch points within hospitals. 

Not saying effective, here, ambiguous statements like tend commonly-used materials. chance. months fighting strict measures NYC bring curve down. shot would end months. Think bigger; ICT devil. Facebook one aspect form social medium corporation.

We embraced ICT society usual glory-eyed paradigmatic technophilic way. people even know word technorealism.

Instead, want know make verb corporate name prove desperately needed know. not, 1 2000 fail.

I’m sorry life given chip shoulder lashing people, especially you’re mixing what’s actually even happening, makes look small mad. Stay save wear mask. really get works happening. shipping companies keeping people board. Countries allow anyone boats due travel restrictions.

They stick back boat. making shore life raft picked local coastguard. steal half million dollar life boat break quarantine illegally enter country, spending days jail.

These guys option leave. OC: realize economics pandemic **countries** lock harder actually better economic recoveries don't?

You: Florida recovering far better California 

Our country’s workforce lost millions jobs. Low-wage/unemployed/uninsured folks wracked trillions dollars debt sick dying due federal leadership’s failure. 

Nine million-plus become ill. Hundreds thousands died. 

Neither Florida California community spread control. Covid-19 sickening millions like unchecked wildfire across middle America. 

And winter coming. 14 days last saw friend. remember high school friend mine extolling virtues condoms rest us (this 1982) talking get STDs used them.

He right, point is, enough outlier new wisdom us. 'em (condoms), definitely used, extent normal procedure now. Although sound like complete tosser, I’m glad seen easy government COULD handled people don’t die mass vaccine

Anti-vaxxers make numbers. Since almost everyone get vaccine, sub-set fact suddenly die serious illness it. endless stories Little 6 year old Timmy got vaccine mysteriously died. inevitable dealing big numbers even vaccine safe. talking people knowingly putting lives line pandemic try save peoples lives. many nurses die think get headline clickbaity? Masks politicized too, compliance levels similar less US. it’s much look at. Yeah, mask party indoors using everytime make safe... Yeah beacuse partial herd immunity, areas people spread rapidly. city -Pune example, 50% immunity, Mumbai 40%, etc. They've done surveys - good thing, since means second wave big cities least lead fewer deaths  course wear mask, wash hands socially distance. do. post replying advised stay home go essentials, cannot government mandates lockdown.

And know coronavirus spreads, staying closed spaces long periods together people associated risk, *even masks distancing*. See example infography exposed even case lockdown, doctor. course, comes job, protect much makes sense can't stay home. work done online, really makes sense governments institutions make us go risk catching virus spreading around.  Stop fearmongering. I’m little bit speechless. Somehow expected seeing happening, puzzling. 

I hope you’re able figure realize matter public health crisis rather political one. 

All countries rooting you, please get together America. UK *is* going lockdown though. Well, lot homes undercounting continue access revenue streams. 

I.e. accept patients. haven’t deleted anything- they’re showing deleted mods removing  Vasectomy is. said thread want repeat it: 


That aint lockdown, joke. Everything stays open. Schools, shops, work, services like barber etc. ... stay open.

The thing closes restaurants bars, aswell zoo, theater cinema.

Thats lockdown, thats joke. barely effect infection numbers. Maybe stagnate 2 3 weeks thats it.

Chains infections affected this. go work, infect corona, bringt home partner children bring work places school mates. barber, massage therapist nail stylist. Oh, friends course come visit 8 pm. Like wrote-it nothing temperature. doesn’t happen gets cold. viruses simply spread easier time year. It’s something happens scientists can’t explain it. may bodies, immune system goes conservation period way sleep. could Earth’s distance sun. could spike protein grows longer certain months. country paying millions people working deliver food round clock everyday,

The way paying food.

With countrywide outbreak even welfare labor rights fanatic Europe can’t afford spend like this, would spring, 

Nah, false correlation. want also needed wages, it’s simply unaffordable counties can’t ask work free. it’s lawful force people stay home, get overturned immediately. allowing people protest like that, shut order done west. 

You mixing many examples without listing countries referring conversation looks like bunch goals posts mounted roombas. 

Try use wildfire example, compare event 100% death rate, starvation,

Oh boy. bet going crazy person prevents people working, eventually people still starving, let’s lockdown people starving enough people produce good, enough money even get food. 

Called it.

And government for. take care people times emergency. virus 0.3% death rate, comparison flu covid, wildfire covid, wildfire comparison compared starvation.

Lol. Imagine ignorant real world works think bad thing happen disease wildfire death.

You trolling obviously insane nonsense, wildfire run away, don’t lockdown. fire burn could burnt, stopped eventually, that’s California deals wildfires, mostly ignore tell people run away houses, lockdown useless 3 scenarios, fires, starvation covid.

Holy shit totally clueless.

Just stop trolling. idea think stand gain making joke like this, embarrassing. IFR CFR way lower... Realistically people realize even stay two idiots still ruin it. (already tired) gonna give in. Die hero live long enough become villain. mask mandates people, alone home, panic porn.
And live world. study involving 5,000 COVID-19 patients Houston finds virus causes disease accumulating genetic mutations, one may made contagious. According paper published peer-reviewed journal mBIO, mutation, called D614G, located spike protein pries open cells viral entry. largest peer-reviewed study SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences one metropolitan region U.S. date. What's bad news Oxford trial? Better known dumbfucks Yeah; great mystery. Makes wonder people stopped thinking best everyone seems much time people spend indoors vs. seasons per se. Areas hot year-round (requiring AC) devastating outbreaks (Guayaquil Manaus, instance). I'd walk take life vessel shore docked. akin slavery / imprisonment. might see inside jail cell days court would enforce sentence. people realize totally unqualified judge medical treatment elderly COVID patients. instance idea two ways treating shortness breath; using oxygen using morphine. Even though experiencing shortness breath might actually also low oxygen saturation dangerous part. two little revelations made realize issue much complicated headlines telling us need wait official investigation condemning anyone. Troll lol Hi - PCR test returned positive result Wednesday, I’ve spent Saturday evening friend rapidly developed symptoms following day. It’s week since got infected three days since test, yet still haven’t developed symptoms. Seeing obviously want get back life soon possible, wouldn’t want waste much money multiple positive tests, would optimal time get tested again? travel -

Who defines essential travel is? New Zealand island Pacific Europe densely packed countries lot people cross borders daily basis can’t really close borders. people waiting deniers get reality check, transition “this liberal hoax” “this globalist liberal plot kill us all” fast it’ll make head spin. Trump literally followed every recommendation Fauci came with, recall... Europe beat 200000! visit town city centre superstore within last month, see 99% public completely ignore measures gov put place. hate Tory gov. scared public’s opinion put foot down. Yeah, doctors know medicine diseases anyways! They're acting like they're experts something... frustrating! Low energy!











S/ areas nyc overwhelmed ie. Elmhurst / corona / jackson heights Fear panic buying kinda tautology. Might well say Boris Johnson's lockdown announcement sparks panic buying.

It's like saying panic attack making anxious. wanna berate it. I’m human fucking being.  Movie theaters open? thought private showings one insisted death threat count forced labor. you.

Now ashamed admit wrong, making lies like president trying get reelected. Land trade borders big thing Australia. managed close state borders still managed land trade across them.

It required lots safety protocols still possible.

The UK/EU it. Assuming young almost certainly gonna die. I'm taking virus seriously guys way top. headline news blasting public every day. Daily medical essential worker death count emblazoned across Internet highways towns cities. People aren’t feeling responsible shamed enough. laying low meaning zero time outside contact anyone? work grocery store. see hundreds people week, despite fact always wear mask, almost half customers see refuse wear one. catch virus, I'd idea whom. explain test positivity rate standard used measure spread new cases per 100,000? Whatever say, please shoot massa. Except clear schools causing loads infections. something specifically unclear hard tell. find valid research papers side argument. children asymptomatic makes much harder tell bought infection household parents did. Could, likely though. applied businesses struggled. Hospitality retail hit hardest. worked way I'm one higher earning brackets country I'm fine. 

They holding hand, us people pay measures taxes managing money pay taxes way want elect to. taxpayer far far seen opposed measures. pay around $40000 year taxes, would probably one higher individual tax payers country agree measures. 

I mentioned another thread, different culture here, culture 'mateship'. group people risk, band together help us together. think freedoms, also effect individual actions someone else's freedom. Elderly sick, lives equal deserving live long free life possible. temporarily give liberties everyone freely leave home, go shops, see friends without risk catching virus could kill them, it.

US younger people recover financial ruin, parents grandparents suffer copd chronic pneumonia can't recover death. like word ""victory"", likely word used media instead official statements. think government would dare declare victory effective vaccine widely distributed across globe. ....\*laughs\* anyone read as, ""Biden tests negative covid campaign?  Like he's source negative news. Okay? Lol rest crew leave too, option stay. There's one life vessel. 

To killed illegally trying enter country? Again, one person get dictate life important everyone forced risk their's. selfishness knows good world see; support slavery. kill someone trying free forced labor meaning think them, ultimate control. 

Anyone dishonest must work president. crack whip massa.

And resorting slurs ashamed admit wrong.

Like claiming limbs chopped forced labor threat death ***according you*** bar clear forced labor therefore slavery.

Just take correction dude join rest world using proper working definitions instead trying virtue signal insist people switch personal definitions.  end actually listen scientists telling us political baffoon. many us work job even option? think there's point closing places facilitate greater interaction small get-together friends. I'm liberal circle even got Halloween get-together invites people even know well (and definitely interact normally).

The enforceable parts locking businesses, interactions continue. what's point? close libraries schools book stores laboratories small-time retail (just time Holidays), people respond spending time friends (inside now) scheduling playdates (or even child rotation schedules people keep working), screwed economy without benefit public health.

Enforce working home possible. Enforce masks. Establish widespread mass testing quick turn around (in house qPCR machines, automatic sample handling, etc... like they've done universities across country). Establish widespread contact tracing. Limit travel states. Close bars indoor restaurants send hundreds billions owners employees relief.

That's good going without bringing military establishing martial law. People finding ways around rules get daily dose human interaction. really think we're point harm reduction way deal this.

For US, enter lockdown late. Lockdowns signs policy failures government. South Korea never shut down. Taiwan never shut down. Get restrictions right support people keep country running without shutting economy. come aren’t locking like countries? wore KN95 doctors appointment could barely breathe. Thought gonna pass out. felt away first wore surgical mask matter getting used it. eventually able errands KN95 on. Except talking kids problem, comment said covid spreading schools verifiable lie. Read better can’t Ha, made up... might be. knows days... believe? respected University that’s 518 yrs old spent 2 months coming scientific conclusion doesn’t align people’s feelings? No, simply pedantic. 

Sounds like checking slaves. Total numbers always make sound worse is. 

Just today, Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Italy, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, UK cases per capita.

The 20,000 cases Belgium would equivalent 600,000 cases US. get bot tells us many 9/11s every time get updated death count? better data get testing centers?

It sounds like measure COVID-19 community without community participation; truly objective, unbiased measure COVID-19 spread. best type random sampling.

We could use determine safe open things back lock temporarily. they've reassigned jack booted thugs ""confiscating guns"" duty think problem like NYC since then. Yes bad, we've learnt treat better along ways help people survive. appears like less threat really is. Everywhere numbers. massive numbers schools we've also seen lack negative consequences. Kids ever problem virus. Keep doubling unrealistic BS wish though. thought lockdown going end arrived. Complain HR? least work, super strict. get fired that. sent us rules made us sign off. good chunk number original wave cases back Spring.

The majority deaths Official COVID deaths still somewhat exaggerated hospitals receive subsidy relation COVID death number county government treating patients

Get fucked conspiracy theory Agreed 2 weeks way short duration. it’s 2 months mine well eternity. 350 million people “land free” would impossible it. Masks required since start school year. Half capacity done May June now, even new lockdown restrictions. Gel leaving entering new area. distancing except cafeteria. Must stay class activities outside classroom eating playground time. activities outside class canceled. Starting next week longer leave main classroom classes, science labs music come rather mixing classes would visit specific rooms throughout day. disaster. read interesting [piece mismanaged Covid data case everyone mask dicks out! &amp; Knuckles started wrong enough tests enough masks. Numbers escalated it’s like trying close barn door horses bolted. Thank god UN finally something overpopulation. time, honestly. pretty confusing us. sure kid tested negative week prior camp. Could false negative could contracted days between. shouldn’t something extreme solve domestic violence issue? USA? enforcing this, honor system? We're gonna take back, first year 1939 Charlie Chaplin evil Nazi regime enslaved Europe tried take world! ... even greater force emerged: UN! UN un-nazied world! Forever! losing job, able dream wedding, kids can’t attend class schooling, travel plans got cancelled. That’s putting life hold .... 

Some angsty teens site really clue life. read Huffington Post tells think regurgitate onto comment section. pray everyday ....and I’m even American what’s wrong cluster zones? anything, they’re better shutting much larger region ""do what's good whether like not"" sounds like something obnoxious do-gooder liberals would say. Resistance consists clicking arrow. people think deeply. Nope. null hypothesis social media impacts behavior. evidence Reddit somehow magical exception? Bless enforce talking rest crew leave too, option stay. There's one life vessel. 

It's good world see; support slavery. kill someone trying flee forced labor meaning think them, ultimate control. 

Go crack whip massa. countries paying *entire* population stay home 2 weeks? Happy Halloween Sorry world changed. Learn evolve go back living huts freely spreading germs amongst kids We're turning corner! gone Easter! pope says atheists go heaven. proving anything here...

you can't get past beliefs superstition. ""lord"" example... change again? afraid speak name? 

the bible say say imply claim.  abandon worship jesus disassociate 'those people' harm do.

and logic... ""in beginning"" guess what, jesus. yet claim god 'turned into' jesus order create.  


""i father one""  jesus trying tell story jewish guys get it.. jesus tries again...  still get stone him.   lesson john?  take shit literally... going wind killing jesus England? Teesside eh? Nothing predicted come pass. agree KF94 masks at. Same. I've chosen HR nursing school requires much time. Unfortunately need work school, I'd definitely become nurse. go contradicting again.

Losing arm death. Therefore forced labor ***according you*** therefore slavery, again, ***according you.***

Why even keep arbitrary definitions straight? conversation much handle? 

Why join rest world using definitions use actually boarding vessels, checking statuses, raising awareness, generally actually trying make difference? going get really, really bad... St. George actually pretty chill place. fact anti-maskers great number makes worried Utah gone completely bat-shit crazy. Weird talking about, source suspected? makes sense.

Teachers far stood group prone getting infected. close schools students 13 older spring though, since summer break everyone back. 

/Middle school teacher Sweden self delusional garbage simple fact. Since like original source look updated CDC IFR% age category. .003% 0-19, .02% 20-49, .5% 50-69 5.4% 70+. 

Data data goes narrative, mean get dismiss it. Yes unfortunate it, like literally every virus even injury, clearly effects elderly more. destroying everyone else's financial social present future extreme measure massive overstep generational proportions. everything reasonable help mentioned comment.  could stop events 2 weeks. 2 weeks. anybody symptoms stay fuck home. way jose that's terrorist talk. Basically first lockdown two changes. ""shielding."" schools/universities still open. even that.. week ago someone still tried tell flu kills people.

And person mid twenties. Strange considering prevalence flu, expect overlap norm, plus flu covid-asymptomatic sought tests. 

Very strange norm. killing elderly little bit time effect future world population all. didn’t downplay Covid all, ever. That’s five deaths never lockdown. said countries downplayed it. Taiwan suspicious right start sent scientists study going Wuhan right away. Basically, didn’t trust China didn’t trust WHO. Everybody else did. Yes simply stating feeling wanted see others felt same. 

Turns quite normal:

""""With kind consistent danger, people get used situations like that,"" says Elke Weber, professor psychology energy environment Princeton University. ""When live war zone, while, everyday risk becomes baseline. neurons wired way respond change. state that's constant basically sort gets washed out."" think issue isn’t dangerous given person gets it... It’s volume people getting it.

It’s dangerous old infirm... means hospitalized increasingly saving lives.

Problem it’s infectious many getting it. causing hospital resources strained hard hit places.

This means medical resources addressed society, best way preventative measures.

There escaping 200+k deaths come.

We keep cautious vaccine... find really soon.

If turns doesn’t work, society likely revisit discussion life can’t hold forever.

But there’s high chance working.

If hold then, 6-8 months things whole lot less dark... time next year it’ll start weird memory lot alive stuff commiserate with.

I remember HS seriously injured literally 18 months could walk comfortable really position. Hell... got surgery (last resort) luckily major success... problems since.

That years ago... now, it’s something kind negatively remember define life it’s like blur doesn’t really seem like long.

This like too... hang cautious bit longer, lot people alive earth you, it’s likely one day one people touch life way. 

It sucks rn... really you’ll glad played ball... bet stats lives saved masks social distancing one day think feel good part help. limited social distancing going majority schools space it. Kids second level education (12-18 years old) wear masks. advocating death tens millions people accommodate life style/preferences. least changes it. That's arguably manslaughter.

Oh, casual genocide argument life deserving elderly sick people. showed colors. Nazi.

But besides that. think ""...there countries lock fine""?
First, please clarify countries referring to. then, please explain difference response compared US. no, increasing education seems main [source outbreaks personally, town confirmed cases first week school reopened september :/ gave little warning would lockdown again. 

It doesnt start Thursday...

Shops selling essential items stay open, shops open click&amp;collect. Going jail something mean forced. one going kill paying taxes. vast majority instances, forced labor enforced via threat death - slavery, ownership individuals actual life. 

Debt bondage slavery, one reason illegal US. can't go jail failing pay debts. Realistically can't go jail paying taxes either, going jail defrauding government active choice. So...it’s everywhere means contact tracing overwhelmed obvious *realities*

you keep using word. think means think means. Reported mine local news. response. They're big halloween party tonight supposedly. pay it. one forcing to.  really. many studies last 30 years linking improved FEV1 (lung function) higher vitamin intake. joke count keeps ticking higher US talking everybody needs forget it. that, see preferred drugs different suburbs got invited one decline I'm quite happy. choosing salty? go. thing. Swedish speaking, noticed big change travel pattern, social distancing, hygiene sweden, ever since March. government trust citizens us great job, need draconian lock beat virus. spent quite bit time observing / working different UN processes headline made _cackle_. USA lot space UK. 1-mil high density UK. Drove local adult store near local university Thursday night. line college kids waiting get slutty Halloween costumes ridiculously long. Seems like parties still going strong weekend. Yay Florida! rehash difference forced labor slavery since seem grasping concept think threatened imprisonment working forced labor slavery.

You could use refresher. point correlation imply causation. saw report news actual IFR (infection fatality rate) one percent (in industrialized nations older still high. half population US got infected, could translate 1.65 million deaths. Id rather get cancer skin illness everywhere else

you realize vitamins, right? told 2 weeks 8 months. really surprising people care anymore? That’s population Melbourne. nose-dicks refusers people generally good masking up. helped serious lockdown right population necessary. numbers cases seems insurmountable think compliance wane. people exactly elect government. Electoral College elects president, sometimes majority voters (see 2016 2000 US elections...). also deal election interference, voter intimidation, etc. I'm saying vote, personally vote every possible election (even whose parties I'm affiliated with. let's oversimplify reality situation. 

As living society one forced work die, and/or choose educating/raising children feeding children, idea ""it's completely changeable people would get asses instead defending stopping it.""... also grossly oversimplifying. talking ending capitalism.

I defend capitalism per se, I'm certainly lazy, ""ending capitalism"" simple question ""getting asses"". Capitalism absolutely unimaginably monstrous machine.

So many ""easy answers"" peanut gallery... U.S.A. NUMBER 1!!! Covid-20 **now influenza** medium time fucking whatever care adjective used, 1 2 years online school better community COVID outbreak. it’s anything like live hospital capacity normally 90-95%. lot wiggle room. generation would been? learned read school. kids show Kindergarten class reading years ago. don’t think there’s big shift children learn school last 40-50 years. Additionally, many kids go preschool didn’t time. means often learn letters/sounds sight words entering school. 

I don’t think there’s ever generation mostly learned read home unless we’re going back 19th early 20th century many children home schooled. also common children schooled middle school level time, though, would aspire that. confusing anyway! Stay home unless going work... well sounds like business usual me. I'm self employed must go strangers homes everyday job... agree. tried locking in, work cause everyone virus continued spread. case country, longer money another hard core lockdown work even everyone respected rules lockdown. Unfortunately individual much, I'm afraid probably right. Stay safe, friend. plurality (as largest single contributor) attendees SD,even 50%. ND next, basically decreasing get father away. start supplementing Vitamin also look Vitamin K, apparently found ton foods quantities.  may effective?). there's whole brands trust issue... 

Anyway think I'm sold supplementing, risk/reward seems favorable. Yo let’s hit 100000 Surely isn’t cold letting population starve unemployment. know lot virus lock downs aren’t needed fight US Predictions: US Stock market crashes November December. Soaring cases December. Many many hospitals overwhelmed US November 10th. Overflow emergency hospitals used. County wide health department mandated lockdowns vs Statewide Federal. maybe Federal relief stimulus packages January, new Congress sworn in.

I stockpiled non perishable food household supplies May October prepare this.

I wear KF94 masks now, wash hands obsessively, social distance much possible, avoid public places. safe everyone!!!

And Reddit, expect downvoted endlessly stating obvious realities. ✌️ ones recall seeing posted one older think still useful simply change calculations needed based current data. single digits back. Ugh. Seriously? know lot healthcare couples. You’re basically asking one quit work pandemic. you’ll complaining doctor nurse shortages!!! nxnddjp it’s fucking bus. like 000033 33.0000? essentially followed ideas layed Great Barrington Declaration. couple months ago? Perhaps anything helpful add, simply avoid making unhelpful statements. statement matter productive, perhaps even counterproductive public utilities may decide collect data CDC opened unhelpful beak. disagree. I’ve spent lot time Vietnam, Taiwan Hong Kong. There’s much respect authority. Fear maybe places, respect. Taiwan even Democratic times say US. places like Vietnam know choice. 😂 self delusional garbage? Please show single state country widespread community transmission managed keep elderly population? realize 100 million Americans elevated risk underlying condition elderly, right? 

We 3 states hospitals struggling already. happens throw fuel fire mom dies appendicitis local hospital bed? argument monumentally fucking stupid. first 8 weeks returning summer break basically dedicated rehashing last 8 weeks previous semester. I'm sure worse days kid. Education standards, least states, woefully inadequate.  using simple math 100,000 cases day 330,000,000 population. I'm sure there's lot factors consider well. hesitate get vaccines late. got vaccinated week half ago today tested positive type b influenza. Thankfully got tested covid Thursday came back negative, nurse tested said timing vaccine likely means still able start producing antibodies faster normal, gotten time would scared. Keep mind follow precautions possibly can, work necessitates leave place everyday unfortunately still times around people following guidelines, highly doubt anyone US truly say unless stay home 100% time come across people supposed doing. effective body world started global pandemic. proof, statement government official, China actually trying eliminate COVID, I'd love see it. Seriously, seen Chinese official say they're trying eradicate COVID without vaccine, I'll believe prove otherwise.

I feel like China, nearby countries, slightly different priorities dealing COVID Westerners do. seems cases manageable, stopping outbreaks ""super-spreading"" events important stopping cases, hence usage mass testing, contact tracing, isolation/quarantine facilities. Furthermore, eradication strategy, NZ/Melbourne style lock-down every time outbreak pops up? care till dying hospital floor. Earlier tried claim New York way cases surging Florida, went Florida twice many New York. 

Now try compare Florida entire continent. go post history, he's thoroughly educated everything this, refuses learn decides ignore he's shown. He's honest, he's spreading disinformation purpose think vit save corona? everyone sun hawaii time? Finally tally actually 101,000.

This insulting comment lmao  Don’t forget selfish parents don’t care.  Wishing best family! feel like I'm similar boat. stocked sounded alarm January everyone thought nuts. I'm still everything know around started getting covid fatigue guard getting dropped. matter time us.  worries, believe you. People dumb. Obama political party controlled white house + senate + house period time. America still get socialized healthcare free college. Americans want things. Amazon reportedly saved $1 billion due reduction business travel. quick Google search pull article up. age 70 much much lower. realize literally every disease injury multitudes times deadly elderly right? go extreme measure those. Covid different. Proper response would issue guidance elderly take precautions, stay home sick wear mask visiting elderly high risk category. data clear effects small subsection population extreme measures harm good. idea. Yes indoor settings like shops public transport African Americans USA vitamin deficient

that supports point.... Exactly. That’s side issue. look grandparents. sides large families (7&amp;9 kids) grandfathers coal miners ones working survived. cost living gotten completely control afford live one one salary. Inflation / cost living skyrocketed wages even remotely kept close keeping pace. comes economy keeping 1% ever growing profits backs workers. It’s funny works like making decisions controlling policies ones benefit isn’t Hell yeah!!! ‘murica number ONE!!!! 🇱🇷🇱🇷🇱🇷🇱🇷 fair that's tomorrow anyone interested (and promoter fake/crappy masks), Aaron Collins’ YouTube channel, independently tests efficiency KF94 KN95 masks using particle generation measuring equipment (he’s fluid dynamics like 20%, kinda need something open economy tourists. swear redditors think governments 

there ways make money tourism. swear redditors think government supposed tell do. jk. that;s way u sound like. Can't hoax, worse flu depopulation effort doesn’t mean need masks walking street isn’t crowded Canterbury? Why? What's point? gain? 

Most importantly, answers, know? problem lol Thanks sharing. think first country see big surge cases, lot people oblivious to. pretty sure surprised third wave. Albeit dramatized, article make good points discussed length, elections March, sure. Moderna Vaccine. pre-existing conditions all. assume person clinically vulnerable question propose risking better option sending child school? strange Nonsense. They're closing pubs restaurants. children. interaction teachers, adminstration parents transport school.

Movement people equals virus distribution. mashed load words together. point? go primary school? still primary school? dealing vocational education universities uk? Germany lot students bit annoyed sector really talked would like learn home come work machines etc. yet allowed schools need open.  
I think mostly people agree good smaller children schools open. brave grow spine days left election. complete lockdown yet, fear cases might still keep rising strict measures put place. Alot new cases people getting time nearly colapsing public transport.. vitamin tablet 5g etched it. use microwave heats tablets even though tablets near microwave. What’s wrong government? Sounds like even fear mongering got disagree, completely. Problem lot people experiencing ""pandemic fatigue"" never real hard day life thus know cope. tip: get therapist realize forever. Remember America used world leader countries would follow suit? 

Make America great perhaps? ain’t China. Hell I’ll settle national mask mandate. won’t continue rise. You’ll see lol Sure, it’s responsible less 10% GDP. 

My point decision made basis tourism non existent year. completely agree. Online learning ideal handled well work surprisingly well. government trying make November hard guys? Wtf? 230K dead deaths upswing nationally. fantasized casedemic south June, reality promptly proved wrong month later. like wrong over? there? want go away week :( Sweden’s good without lockdowns, show lockdowns never solution  Disgusting. gross negligence tolerated? Lock up. Make accountable. F shit. Lol want Sincere question - wouldn’t flatten curve infection rates quickly? less vectors spread disease (because people vaccinated), wouldn’t slow spread corresponding rate? It’s Boris special stage. speaks hour said summarised bullet points news article Unlikely. Probably places sell food etc. Agh, fair though. one come contact dozens people day. Frustrates arrogant people are. Vic government gave payments people sick leave could isolate awaiting tests covid quarantine two weeks. dont think even put milk milk UK stores. Bad bot. Closing schools means parents can't work.


Closing universities means landlords dorms get money. 


Its money. trial proves eating extra vitamin helps. correlations vitamin levels. Nice strawman such... 2020 - official year toilet paper 🧻 Plus people satisfied close 50% margin error. I've kind come conclusion entirely comfortable kids school teachers parents/grandparents get vaccine. area lockdown cases day worst pandemic

guess cases... not? Lock downs work. leading, starving population. Yes fun PAAAANDEMIC? political ok shit upswing tard, moving summer months schools already going months+. near initial wave. 

You e r mad many poeple dying wished politician party lockdown right? Canadian, kept much. I'm Germany spread tablets notebooks schools disgrace. lot schools even good enough internet connection beamers/displays class rooms. education ministers started order tablets pandemic. little late. media tight leash, CBC funded unbiased. people work would like force take test! Possibly. guaranteed deployed scale then. Hopefully, definitely late spring early summer earliest. Certainly live North London expect next week Italy gave small amount, waved rent taxes period time distributed everyone groceries Look total data picture far. Research many people nationally &amp; globally likely infected. Research % herd immunity likely kicks in. math ask something tackling not. Even enforced measures don’t make virus magically go away understand. live area snows 6 months year best ways get vitamin d. cant either supplement vitamins. yeah, important point, 2-8 year old kids seen extremely good wearing masks. see parents kids wearing them, wear too. issue. Probably highschool college kids can't trusted socially distance consistently wear mask, likely become vector disease. Heck, store ""1 hour NHS vulnerable people"" thing, amount shit got insane. Luckily nothing physical, endless amounts verbal abuse... problem Serco given contract drag NHS name mud producing shit app outrageous cost public perception track trace app poor Seems like good idea vary methods attack. long suggested scientists first round vaccines might less effective help us get started road controlling things, later vaccines might effective.  speak republican... uhh what? time tell, sound like conspiracy nut Pushing innocent meat grinder, they're doing! Feeding machine benefit. people never left mother's womb. Let suckle ovaries, feast unborn brothers sisters like predatory lunatics are, stay fuck land living! Things like spelling such... living central London (now Sydney) first lockdown. Compliance really, really good. almost never saw unmasked face. Apparently, good away central London. oh yeah, fuck adults get infected due kid. also, even know long term effects covid. know nurse, work icu. Shut fuck up, clue it’s like right nurse. many strangers say bye week died? Oh , that’s right none.. I’m last face people see.. family, friends.. strange nurse giving drugs don’t feel choking can’t anymore ventilator, it’s maxed out.. I’m sure you’re going caulk another algorithm response. Fuck you. lockdowns good Boris’ hair every week measures might even curb spread, people adhere isolation. Oh sweet summer child. long life lot lessons learn. yeah I'd love see actual study site seems like coronavirus killing people sort lockdown would Maybe put lockdown vote then? Important measures warrant referendum, they? Wonder American covid deniers going make them... steal money wheelbarrows whether pandemic not. good reason think health scare real. 'Flush turd November 3rd' Lmao yeah go one dakotas instead please went hiking peak district Mam Tor probably 50 people trail more. 

This 45* f temps wind 30mph range. 

I shocked see many people there. Oh worry. sent vote weeks ago. Biden would done worse first, would done much better overall. afraid looking ""weak"" get it. 
And id repent believe naturally want follow Jesus' ways include good person. good alone get heaven. believe repent. 

Matw really think called logic bettee God himself? Yeah no. God's word 100% correct, correct deduce logic, btw isn't. 
Jesus separate part God makes God too. said before. Like arm part body. Stop limiting God. Almighty, infinite, Alpha Omega, first last. Elohim, Yaweh, Yeshua, Jesus. him. keep thinking God one man sky. he's divine comprised Father, Son, Holy Ghost. called titles listed more. great, comprehend greatness. Stop limiting him. 
Scripture says again. Jesus said many times. Jews refuse accept God lol. 
Also corrupted thing? I- typing gibberish lol. 
If going reply, please debunking I've said, tiring. I'm repeating ssme things still get it. 
Also judged sins judgement day comes. good person thing need. even good can't sinless wholy good, something bad least once. Something perfect. judged Book Life God records lives. 
So someone believes repents wrong things, saved still, yes. wrongdoings go unpunished. 
However believe Jesus Son God died could forgiven, repent, saved. Yes easy, bur ppl make hard. God great made easy. Even murder saved Jesus cross repented believed. 
However claim repent continue life evil person, repentance. evil person saved unless repent aka change ways acknowledge wrong doings. Maybe foolishly meant something like word Yonder. I've told yonder direction kind distance really place though. Maybe looking nations thinking need go Yonder turn corner go away guys go way way ahead. thought done way ahead.

USA USA USA ....wait. 5% world population, it’s even worse described. yeah posted eric ding

a china study found genomed virus broken feces pipe. internet really bad. google it. Argentina lockdown entire winter cases starting go down. Prepare 6 months lockdown. makes sense - UK \~66mm people \~25k new cases day. US \~340mm people \~70-100k new cases day. scaled basis population -  
UK's outbreak beyond what's going US. lockdown likely drags thru end year given colder weathers lower humidity makes COVID easier spread. Nice, thanks explaining Would like get list they're calling essential non-essential time round they've changed last time. genuinely think way going go, sadly. lockdown whenever virus begins pose real threat health systems etc. taking brunt economic hit afterwards. would've much preferred government got right first time round like new zealand stomped virus then. 

We definitely would've able enjoy Halloween without stress light lockdown measures introduced haha! Europe getting fucked much worse US, 14 European countries today much higher infection rates US missed important question. people incentivized comply? 

As someone working hospitality industry another lockdown might last straw many places. Thank good headline campaign yes. Want seen something, trying break country. envy decisions make, though time desire become leader country either. yup! wife? attack. plan setup global revolution trigger ww3. succeed. Burn TV. Hmm. feel protests? know. ones everyone hates Trump? viewing site, somehow okay. Gotta honest, I've done shits composed England point. Well obviously, can't eat mask on. still need wear restaurant pub table. Nope. dickhead house mates literally preparing throw party tonight...

Still thinking report sadly privilege provided numbers way down. Simply enough people break rules exception spread multiple house holds.

Even near zero cases Melbourne, current role one person one household visit one house hold per day. meet outside much want indoor house gatherings primary places transmission. based best medical science available, easy popular policy politician mandate reality situation.

There easy win virus, either keep lockdowns half assed, temporary drop numbers surges go full lockdown like Melbourne essentially deny virus room move burns out. That’s people hood said gang members ratted God, hope sooner that. Everyone admitted, necessary, Netherlands least. non essential healthcare scaled down, bad enough course. collapse bit overstated Giod.. folks stull wearing mask need get board already. Yeah went told , six weeks think ? one right choose gets live gets die. 

It’s also death. Stop obsessing death. Covid causes long term health issues forces lot people quit livelihoods, even they’re young. would want cripple young forever sake of... nothing?? UK politics seperate America. everything Trump. Exponential growth reason stop cancer numbers Macmillan segment breakfast news program ITV morning.
My partner teacher abuse disclosure figures training went on. almost obsessively wash hands. I’m going fridge grab snack, I’ll wash hands first touching fridge, I’ve unpackaged food item onto plate bowl, I’ll wash hands eating it.

These new habits led borderline mental health incidents like washing hands sometimes 7-8 times within 30 minute time period, never left home.

This part toll pandemic taken me.

What covid craziness going through? Frankly you’re wearing mask forfeited human rights. clearly care 40% deaths 80. dont care logically fallacy statement. elderly people would still need go hospital. would still overwhelm hospitals. would still infect others. Young people would still die. 

If think go hospital playing dumb. Dying illness hurts. torture. can't let people die slowly home 80, need give support. Death scary, die hospital. need die, deserve chance living years. Bring 80 mean bed bound vegetable anyway. Older people still value. grandfather 90 working year. also fucker, actually like guy. Australia locked 6 months almost zero. Look people, thinking fucking superior. Fuck lot tbh. America England bloody world leaders long ago. they're embarrassment. history posting /r/The_Donald /r/conspiracy. highly suspect political scientific reasons anti-lockdown. Yes, thats possible. mean 3-4 year harsh restrictions. love downvoted people refuse accept people, including special needs, exactly same. without confiscating every single cent vatican 

Even without covid, happen. apologize. messed read everything wrong jug. edited comment right posting correct myself.

My 2% added vitamin D. lockdown work UK follow measures taken (and proven) Island Nations closing borders/having incoming travellers say government controlled accommodation ensure carrying. 

They also need implement track trace system run excel (works people comply e.g. cash incentives stay home). London pretty well complied last time. think again, certainly new rules make difference, even everyone. Lives don’t ruined. government needs make sure people supported.

Unfortunately Tories greedy fucks concerned financially back lockdown. Hence said it’s easy decision. particular risk may need take different approach We'll they're definitely going wrecked now. bullshit. I'm New Zealand economy back running. Yes take huge hit way 'domestic violence 'triple' Covid relief fund give everyone livable wage way double minimum. Lockdown done CORRECTLY saves thousands lives, doubt that.  listening much propaganda. Europeans love portray Americans backwards, ignorant, shithole. American liberals join echo America exceptionally bad.

Really US much different rest world. Politically, he's fool getting tested close election. days positive test means almost certainly loses. Tough situation in. winter good prediction. crap whole year then. Need know exist otherwise straight amazon. Maybe retarded white people thought superior roflmao. ""Can't really find many sources.""

Lol. That's (morally acceptable) advantages pandemic kills hundreds thousands people, leaves tens thousands possibly life-long debilitations. Destroying economy, causing untold amount mental illness (anxiety, depression, etc). lot people kids probably going socially debilitated things go back normal. lot kids going behind school, especially economically disadvantaged youth.

The (morally unacceptable) advantage could say slightly reducing population, ridding population weaker people (obese, unhealthy, etc.). stated morally unacceptable advantage, since people unable put aside emotions think logically this, probably get F right bat taking position. quit? Thank you. /s? Honestly, gonna stop? many act like deep everyone knows one Torrent's multiple alts. 1 case Australia yesterday.

One.

Life Normal helluva lot normal have. 2% milk fridge 15% vitamin D, ingredient list says vitamin added. (context) 

I've neglecting schoolwork long time due stress save ass I've found way cut corners. research interviews I've done Covid could well adjust fit overdue project. thing I'm missing finish personal perspective foreigners. I'd appreciate lot could help answering couple questions way that's comfortable enough. need answer everything explicitly time.

In essence, I'd like hear story views.

Maybe thread could spark interesting discussions idk.

(Questions)

How doin'?

What country from?

What's background? (Not enough doxxing pls)

What perspective lockdowns?

How acquire perspective?

What impact lockdowns life?

What beliefs issue peer group, family community?

How think groups acquired beliefs?

What economic, social, environmental impact issue community country?

How think Mexico Venezuela handled issue? Oh, would he's cunt. We've taken homeschooling school good it, we're lucky enough afford make choice, many families can't. colleges seem taking approach. personally know you? No, don’t. wanna fit parrot you’ve told. could headache would show positive go test. Obviously everyone wore masks cokes would reduced (they Japan polite gesture).

Doesn’t mean everyone lives fucking ruined it. Gyms help anxiety, apparently arent deemed essential. Yet greasy ass fast food smh grateful worked/studied forced jobs. Taking shit strong suit, dealing pandemic would absolute hell. No. see harmless way feel less anxious. Like binging Netflix. scotch. Watching sunsets. Nowhere article say people buying crystals lieu masks wearing crystals instead getting test lose sense smell. Plus, bad economy, people mine sell US getting income. Yes save lives. Yes obviously scenarios it’s likely we’d hit amount deaths matter what, total deaths lower end this. Or, go outdoors sun instead locking basement Yeah, make online order, store give time pick up, it'll either collect store, someone shop bring put boot (trunk) you. really good system, memory free said lockdown dire situations hospitals overrun. lockdown used buy time. crazy developed countries keep needing lockdowns figure do. ...no-ones told us far? weirdos England made fuss Guy Fawkes night 5th less time goes (I remember Grandparents making thing 5th opposed Halloween) rest us non-Englanders opted Halloween night long I've alive anyway. Well, conspiracy theory openly admit care economy poor, minorities elderly.  Like Canada, measures need **ENFORCED**. NOTHING making people take seriously depressed, fucks economy boot, literally FUCK ALL! used emoji flag Slovenia. long running joke, people mistake slovakia slovenia, vice versa. friendly joke, rivalry countries. Every graph showing increase around mid-September. literally education. closing beyond me. Interesting. See, understand hospitals better informed (hopefully) prepared handle cases now, sure seems weird taking active steps slow current surge numbers. get right current White House placed campaign platform idea really anything see here. point, though, acknowledge must more?? I'm scared silly best case scenario greater response 2 1/ months. Simple question, yet again. UK stand for? Smileys reddit know impacts development children? Death long-term disability parents. I'm guessing meant tourist £'s. 

Which certainly true lot sectors. Airline companies run profit summer loss winter. That's Thomas Cook went eve winter season 2019. knew possible turn profit winter. 

This year airlines running loss summer even greater loss winter. They're gonna need serious funding else everywhere ready open back up, airports still take least 5 years get back pre-covid flights. affect holiday goers, it'll large impact imported goods. I'm small town full Trump trains masks. (Utah).... I'm 40 weigh 400, health issues weight vitamin deficiency supplement, still scares two kids 4 lost grandma. need lose dad year mom major surgery earlier year. think ny would safer places. place perfectly safe though. worth noting: outbreak spread states b/c decision shut borders ad-hoc crossings.

isolation also works. Naw. like 3-D spiral towards abyss right now. best could disposable cloth masks, masks one layer Swiss cheese approach. please continue wonder it’s fault victims instead widespread lack public adherence basic epidemiological protocols. Family friend went take advantage EOTHO. Said must fine.

He caught covid, spent week hospital. Died last Friday. People spoken morning, normal conversation, 5 hours later gone.

Now Boris saying ""hurdurrhurr made mistake eat scheme, soz everybody, thur hurhurf"".

You could argue known risks, government actively trying get people pandemic, can't help wonder held accountable. going close schools pay parents stay home many school daycare. It’s tough problem sure reality closing schools caused many secondary problems cost ton political capital. Thankfully, see lot people sub thinking BS. problem is, chose go gatherings friends prevent spread, yet people go partying massive gatherings. Whatever doesn’t effect me, people risk health going grocery store me, want fuck around gatherings, fine risk family friends help. get curbside shit stay away people public wear fucking mask obviously political move make Trump look bad right Election Day. /s worry much worse 8 months ago white people simply retarded? first day looks like 0.5 - 1% tests positive (including false positive) maybe fighting wrong front... 
We see  Six months late bud fucking wrong, post sources 20 percent cut enough scrape by? Cause scraping 100% rediculously selfish take. Fuck off. Yeah, nurses health professionals qualified give medical advice. Nurses give medical advice time, especially around diseases. need able diagnose illnesses (sometimes easy, sometimes hard) able give medical advice .

I nurse spend day giving medical advice. also spend lot time talking doctors know I'm depth, passing information patients ways know understand.

Nurses bumwipers pillowfluffers, highly trained educated workforce massive amount knowledge experience qualifying us give advice people.

Some ignorant dicks poor critical thinking impulse control well. ever get advice nurse sure about, please look secondary opinion read around see follows guidelines reputable (hospital University) sites, speak doctor. masks aren’t standard surgical situation.

That doesn’t mean doesn’t stop spread... smh Americans dumbfucks? País falso jajajajaj Politicians told people go beaches, terraces, etc. prefer made term: Utonians means, quote used word “permanent”. Report see them. help make harder might save lives. Let's willingly create world taking time work raise children means ""forced work die"", I'm sure that's amazing way benefit lives humans planet also great something like controlling pandemic re-read article, spend lot time indoors. that's problem. 2 months leads regression many kids. 18 months astronomical. clear many people dont understand academic regression is. first months new school year spent reviewing old material. students go summer school protect regression thats fantastic idea! anyone opposing lockdown? single best solution! go boris! sick part wonders pandemic weed dumb gene pool. call Corona-Bob, Bagdad Bob. outbreak China infectious people; ok is, going spread outside China; ok did, going spread Europe; OK did, outbreak Lombardy need test anyone returning home ask self-quarantine; OK is, tested confirmed COVID-19 child must still attend school. Working home encouraged unfair everyone cannot work home. I'm unfairely ridiculing guy; he's said things (spread months course) pull direct quotes Swedish requested. listen Corona-Bob exact opposite likely correct thing listen him. country, yes. guys havent plateau´d yet, still going up, semantic definition. you´re W1 yet. correct. reach linear growth instead exponential, it´ll lot better within following 183 days. 

assuming proper vaccination cycles orderly distancing / masks etc, it´ll fine you´ll see linear growth plateauing eventually reducing numbers dailies on.

herein lies problem side pond; already submitted partisan politics outright hackery. hint, five points: isnt going anywhere without nationwide vaccination programs. visited r/conspiracy then. sub large number ""plandemic"" posts. lost control one post wrote comment asking OP respect frontline healthcare workers. called tool liar it. source even need, lockdown Europe sees far cases Florida without restrictions, sources place, proof thread well, I'm gonna source basic knowledge, otherwise need link every meaning words type, that's basic learn now. remember correctly, many countries really found evidence schools driving pandemic much. Yeah, diseases *generally* spread well type environment, new virus works different ways. first time, co- infection occurs bad. pedantic. forced labor slavery. ...so, 300 million people. certainly hasy topics showed ignorance on, talking COVID fill stupidity. Unadulterated stupidity. I'd recommend actually getting news China's COVID policies actual Asian news sites, Reddit. really simple can't take Trump literally. ""away"" clearly means ""endemic"". sarcasm. /s must Damien boy again. SARS MERS far, FAR deadly Covid. 

The thing contagious, example SARS transmitted without showing symptoms, onset symptoms, pretty much require hospitalization immediately (that's called ""severe acute"" respiratory syndrome""), leaves little time transmit active case quarantined hospital.

There SARS cases US, US contained easily, SARS far less contagious. online learning doesnt work special needs, uninvolved parents without money. Can’t ways. virus contagious deadly European countries go lockdown? Yes? close fucking schools, otherwise, claims bad virus become lie contradictory action! 
In US, schools hundreds/thousands students, social distancing impossible, even alternating days. High school kids intermingle hundreds kids hallway every hour classes. Masks worn, although mandated. Kids assholes refuse. old ventilation system another problem many schools. Lunchtime becomes problem- logistics, distribution, masks eating. 
If European’s school system bad, entitled student attitudes anything like America, screwed keeping schools open offering online- sucks too, doesn’t work small kids, putting national lockdown- it’s serious, close schools. fired. people respect recommendations? shopping centres bars significantly less crowded right now? contribution disease's various characteristics towards ""success"" interesting. arguably deadly diseases, vectors, communicability, incubation rate, onset mortality, etc., prevented widespread infection outside local population. 

Add non-biological factors, like general refusal populace conform containment procedures, success harder predict. article says 60% probably overestimation. Regardless, towns haven’t reached full herd immunity yet. still don’t see disagree. points 1,2, &amp; 3 last comment true also true. 

I’m trouble finding data positivity rate daily new cases broken zip code. Would homie move could link found positivity percents. repeated year year college. 

What trashy school go taught 1st-grade material 5th grade? No, information repeated year. move next step. [archive link anyone trouble accessing article Meh, kinda doubt there's much correlation. Sturgis attendees live SD. likely reason getting cold people recreating indoors. one wears masks social distances governor told hoax. Aren’t also kids tested (the parents) won’t close schools down? Totally cool educators school staff needlessly exposed mommy break. clearer information research people asymptomatic? sure agree, experts saying 18-24 months.

May: ton articles majority experts put us scenario right now. think people hear want hear, say ""THE EXPERTS WRONG."" OK... that's case idiots want GET VIRUS then??

Wear fucking mask. much winning! take track, give genuine thought ponder. thinkers would probably question one raised social construct, really possible know what, any, biological difference real, constructed? NI locking down, much milder lockdown (for least). I've heard anecdotally compliance poor though said flu contagious pre-symptomatic people ALL, no, countered point. spread misinformation flu different COVID. I'm American.

Personally, impression China eradicated COVID I've seeing daily posts two Chinese users repeating thing again.

Can't blame giving benefit doubt. Desafortunadamente no. Vengo de Dinamarca tío. tons shortages spring. Friends family called doomsday prepper stocking sanitizer masks canned food back January. March friends family begging give some. people stupid, lockdown WAY, like shooting foot got feet pain. nationwide mask mandate would done job maybe temperature check business entry. I'm surprised CDC still contact tracing =/ meanwhile Florida 5,592 new cases 70 deaths yesterday US awful response doesn’t negate fact China lied virus futile attempt cover up, keeps lying infected death figures. 😂 fuck ever happened flatten curve? get hand? groups mass gathering without distancing pandemic. Absolutely true statement New Zealand’s first lockdown pretty extensive. Definition “essential” pretty much limited supermarkets, pharmacies, primary infrastructure... know, things actually essential. specifically, suggest means people high risk COVID (mild symptomatics, close associates positives) getting tested they're afraid results loss 10 days personal freedom work. Waiting either goes away go hospital. Forgive might facts wrong, quoting memory peole deliver food people's doorstep go out, people still crowding grocery stores lockdowns. like lie millions times think everyone idiot like you. Also saying topic shows really need basic education lock down, people staying home time, going grocery stores make lockdown fail. Government paying anyone deliver food, volunteers needed, isn't, lockdown definitely fail. still refuse facts truth even understand makes lockdowns work say I'm topic, volunteers crucial aspect many European lockdowns, dumb? Think memorialize 9/11, Oklahoma City, Pearl Harbor, etc. Yet crickets 230,000K American deaths growing every day.

To shows society care far property damage human life. 

If actually jets falling sky would've top priority. people want work. Also, work (at least America), putting money system. eligible social security. might get spouse's benefits (after death) divorce, get anything.

I worked plenty retail jobs elderly people forced work die. took time raise children stay home wife. husbands died/left them. never put money social security. get small amount. enough live on.  

Not working really fucks future up. long take pretty much everyone state get rate? Spain? ""5-9 day wait Insta-cart deliveries.""

The government would take supply chain supply chain working, supply chain works fine, need people continue work make supply chain happen.

Instacart hired 300,000 (new) ""shoppers"" March help keep demand believe 750,000 shoppers. example working supply chain distribution. GOVERNMENT NEEDED!! Workers are.

""We GIANT country lot moving parts, people, services, etc."" places done this. city Ontario, hotspots closed indoor dining, gyms, museums, etc. sure offices though. PM wants avoid national shutdown whole country, rather hot spots. Since Canada federation provinces decide closes national shutdown PM would enact special ""emergencies act"", would likely controversial. even good plan. literally defeated wearing mask. Americans Reddit think COVID ""eradicated"" China, actual Chinese people understand COVID long-term problem. China claimed completely eradicated COVID strategy. Bela Matyas, Solano County health officer, said: “This clear indication potential occur.

""We flu community time COVID ...contracting either disease may weaken immune system make susceptible disease.” * Brain endothelial cells show distinct pro-inflammatory response exposed various SARS-CoV-2 spike protein subunits.

Is implication vaccines based protein subunits? Yup. I’m Austin hear people complaining locked down...i shake head. literal things locked Gyms, Movie Theatres, live music, indoor dining. can’t think another thing couldn’t wore mask. Got flu shots! Bring COVID vaccine! sound like kids going dropped back society 15 years something. signs point summer vaxx. fine. Probably appreciate others before. Yeah that’s fine. I’ve studied quantum gravity taught trade stocks I’m sure I’ll able understand while. Thanks Yeah what's hot take europe breaking new did. respite gave great hope. sure long term outcome was. sounds lot better. What's reason coughing blow nose test? clear sinuses? needs robust government response enforce masks distancing thing stop spread enforce even harsher policies like shelter place closing businesses depend crowds. needs federal unity mask distance advocacy need least pressure state leaders enacting plans. Virology. History. would read, study.. first pandemic last. conspiracy. 🤦 Would work? Even I'm skeptical. think agree point NEITHER conservatives liberals give shit COVID anymore. least young ones. liberals willing fake something important comes up. Ah yes, fictional virus totally isn’t dangerous shouldn’t require us either socially distance wear masks gonna depopulate nation. Winter going brutal... Um, even protests? one spat law enforcement. copying absolutely case, unfortunately. 100% children *not* going back person schooling possible, sad reality move remote schooling hurts children already bad place due economic circumstances. add fact maybe underemployed guardian good chance unemployed, choice eating getting child cheap chromebook obvious one. 

Our education system (in US) many institutions sadly failing children, pandemic, COVID simply made failures even apparent. sorry, things dispute? Fauci kind rando? 

Not disputing person information, disputing thought process lack hard basic public health points repeating months, basic. something untrue three things said? 

I show even prominent people saying opposite. true authority derived looking data like better indoor Masks better masks Small group better large group

Yes. wanted see simply repeating talking points actually done research.

I got answer. understand fighting basic things.

I not. paying attention actually saying. making sure! Simply, yes. depends getting tested. example site done follows: waiting outside, cough blow nose outside entering building, check id swab inside building alone personal huge hallway waiting results outside. inside building 1- 2 minute everything desinfected person. sites completely external via drive through. sites maybe internal lot choices. *sighs*... *unzips* Hong Kong Flu 60s, Swine Flu 00s. SARS MERS major epidemics also. mean they've happened. either cars less contagious, far less deadly Covid. guess MERS contagious deadly, but, absurd extent wipes local population spreads. Exactly. couldn’t imagine school staff’s shoes. That’s get little wound hear schools open babysit people’s kids lol Floridian here, much shut down, hospitals even laying people off!

Disney World opened August, whole state shut 2 months. Anyone thinks Florida operating normal March-June live here. No. socially awkward people know behave social situations. probably straight... given wonky eye... intensely studied. It’s pretty much amazing real world sample long takes go almost cases holding major event, two months later 40% positivity rate.

And billionaires want do, billionaires real power. face, Europe!

People choosing ignorant isnt freedom. Thats stupidity. Rounding corner spiral staircase 200k deaths Maybe vote people write bigger checks. sure. Although honestly red Idaho is, it’s surprising seriously governor taking it. lot people know upset requiring masks Boise, reverting things back get cases. I’m quite happy republican governor. 101k according worldometer. Also Maryland. Proud area (Montgomery County near DC) still pretty good masks social distancing. Sorry grandfather. comment political. scientifically political analysist. Two huge different ideas. understand legal position, what's practical position? ""Your hospitals filled up, can't accept new patients, healthcare system part state completely overwhelmed... Guess suck deal!"" “The US mostly”... oh really, know? “I wouldnt know” find politicians appear newspaper coverage [fornCOVID-19 news] frequently scientists,

That absolute disgrace. China making huge strides reforestation, largely due ability flat tell thousands people degraded land areas ""Yeah, planting watering trees full time job now"" choice matter.

They're climate change, give fuck infringing individual freedoms get there, that's they're going succeed. feel like every week see phrase ""biggest one day increase record"". undoubtedly higher whatever number listed. Yikes. Americans wouldn’t willingly go isolation center, think things would’ve gotten ugly. Stop fear-mongering. 

I hearing months upcoming ""healthcare system collapse."" Still happened. Hold beer. Im Aussie know lot US politics, hear US numbers due 'increased testing' though...strangely enough Sweden using excuse today account new upswing. Ban testing?  first week December says “hold keg” Please check friends family often winter. Things looking good. important difference us Europe many Europeans countries actually extinguished first wave meaning break summer rest health care workers, rebuild supply equipment stockpiles assess worked work.

We never finished first wave... Yeah course people get depressed realise government ignoring virus killing us Hol' up. country this? Really going herd immunity eh?...we’ll see ya Oh, reddit. Never change.  know people lol, like people blame Obama things possible control over, people look election blame Biden everything happened November 3rd 😂 horrifying. feel like we're precipice truly calamitous era American history. also pay taxes... 1200 enough people, mention people live Juarez rely American job provide whole families there. next day, 101,000 know people decide make posts like cases even reported yet. Organisations facing challenge making money pay salaries journalists news reporters. Paywalls one mechanism resort since advertisement revenue may suffice.

I've slowly stocking canned goods, disinfectant, etc. Getting ready leave house again. know COVID-19 voting for. It’s true. Hopefully something better take it’s place. crazy unheard of. wife 72-hour periods. one said good corner Remember days hearing ""1000 cases one day, biggest one day increase record"" absolutely horrific? Ugh, I'm tired af 2020 Why? Make America Go Away means higher testing capacity - thus finding infected - found medicaments reduce symptoms less people die COVID-19. Florida wayyyyy nursing homes. can't understand started NY State /s I’m sorry loss. I’m kinda torn deciding worse. fact there’s lot celebrities endorsing science denying world view fact there’s actually people whose vote swayed dumb ass rappers going germicide lamps closed space testing rooms, aka going safe.
Also, no, done inside. testing places external.
The risk getting infected probably 10x less going get groceries yeah thanks misinformed comment, hope choke 1k comment karma. Fuck Yeah America! Going high score! can’t believe substantial amount US population support stupid fuck runs country without seeing wrong point? Lots people quarantine exposure Covid.

Edited grammar. least would show leadership spout conspiracy theories like fucking madman. DeWine let fast. pulled trigger little late first shutdown opinion, still better lot. total 180 mandating masks course like 6 hours. Dude absolute coward something may impact shot re-election.  look long took American authorities like CDC even acknowledged aerosol transmission. ""Biggest one-day increase record"" really catchphrase year, it. hope that’s case really do. Wouldn’t nice govt share legit info bed space public?  Impossible! Trump ended pandemic! /s want know too. better able treat it? place I’ve heard overwhelming hospitals El Paso Salt Lake City right now. people get infected, they'll find vaccine actually works... know vaccine trials work? TBH think trump wants us get covid stop talking talk he's jelly belly! quality life, depends approach it. forget flu season! test more! 

This argument still makes sense me. widespread asymptomatic testing going US? Can't even imagine many symptomatic cases popping daily. \*nauseated

I correct used make mistake time.  getting exponential growth. We've getting steady growth could see mile away Understood. rest world doesn’t necessarily see way. Catholicism technically religion, according whatever guidelines someone set whenever. Mormonism doesn’t even fall within guidelines. considered cult theologists.  Yes, likely this, plus socioeconomic issues lack insurance, lack access healthcare leading health problems, frontline worker employment, distrust medical system general referring therapeutics. turning corner treatments. (still bullshit, available long time). plenty rail Trump but, common guys. ""had"". 10mil total, active cases. Australia also politicised pandemic. Pretty much western countries have. like 40%, otherwise yeah. Dont tell trump wants us number 1, kill us keep status. Everyone undercounted necessarily malicious. Grandfather died first wave April nursing home Illinois. 94 years old, three active cases facility, woke cough, died day.

He time get covid test, especially since tests short supply April. cremated according wishes never counted official numbers. really anyone's fault guaranteed tens thousands cases like counted over. Happy Halloween guess. 

Except time horror pretty real. done better job forget justified. reports say vaccine provides temporary immunity partially effective. Especially since virus mutate. means would rely majority people vaccinated for, guessed it, us gain herd immunity. Thank descriptive writing. put words exactly feel. eels dead on. started feeling dread doom Aug 2019, knowing something bad coming wasn’t much surprised 2020 turned shit show. Hadn’t helped deal though except yo make totally numb, appreciate house rarely leave.  said couldn’t it, listen? NO! America stupid even harshest critics! Generally public health experts get stage talk smack.

Really? I've heard quite doctors voice concern opioid epidemic. evidence first lockdown subsequent restrictions voting Leave one strongest predictors breaking lockdown ignoring restrictions. See e.g.:

- far correlated factor plenty possible explanations people would voted leave break lockdown/restrictions. think important make sweeping assumptions try create division. agree polarisation part problem.

A big part people's resistance complying government repeatedly lied completely about-faced pretended never lied. We've got unprecedentedly low trust government. People need start taking things seriously government bears responsibility making happen. Ultimately though people reckless suffer most.

Stay safe encourage everyone around take seriously. need 2021 better year. That's 3x many cases Australia total. US 3.4 Australia's worth cases single day.

These numbers basically unfathomable me. Maybe Moon really made cheese?  wrong sing Jeffersons Theme Song time hit new daily record? I've isolation long ... Fuck shit I’m here.  doubt Olympics next year either, given things progressing. Talibangelist Honest question, deaths stable around 1000 per day even numbers climbing.

Edit: know there's usually delay couple weeks infection whole month October around 1,000 90 people die every day car accidents, context refute idiots still think covid death numbers “nothing.” plenty neckbeard actors. Tom Hanks example. I’m rural Kentucky... we’ve like 200 cases since started 80 last week. told people around got would spread like wildfire. think it’s hoax. Hang going get this! Wow, 5% staffed beds US occupied COVID patients. Also Melbourne, proud Victorians following science. Enjoy well deserved freedoms long winter. Well MOVIN UP!!

WE'RE #1 

WE'RE #1 positivity rate still 10%, that's good, however see going 10% soon. Yes long R next name, remain office. vote right. Yes McNuggets must keep flowing Aggressive. 

There absolute truth saying, though.

Either way, trend things taking encouraging. collapse occurs healthcare workers start falling ill. available beds want, won’t mean anything one care patients. 

This Mayo’s tweet Western Wisconsin today: consider either South Korea Taiwan small geographically isolated. almost impossible contact tracing now, unless quarantine pretty much everybody. Thanks idea! RemindMe! November 14, 2020 assuming means 97k 970 dead. 

If keeps happening means every day another 970 Americans less weeks live. 

That completely unacceptable numbers avoidable. Everyday deja vu. headline may well see confirmed counts day 200-300k range day winter rolls gatherings Halloween Thanksgiving taken place. Skyrocketing? I've read anything said vitD deficiency leads higher susceptibility? linked severe infection/worse outcomes? say disproportionate effects talking higher infection rates worse health outcomes? feel like I'm another reality. could real? could allowed happen? wrong people?! understand dont care people dying! I'm tempted again, one ever give much collective shit given March. vocal minority got wish came lockdowns. taiwan uses surgical mask, gone 200 days without single case.. hand handling COVID going going yearly disease la cold/flu season never possible keep Americans contained nation cured.

We may nation bungling it, we're probably biggest also travels *constantly*.

We needing worry (COVID-19) going Great Leap Forward bad say one world-changing events history. know *now* absolutely terrible. Europe 3 times many daily cases Maybe it’s big lack knowledge healthcare system/infrastructure kind blows mind right ICU amount 10k country exactly far away “full” ICUs.

This known trial balloon Typical Republican doublespeak bullshit. Plays sides - right wing reads denial pandemic. Politician says “I say pandemic” - true accurate. Honestly, yeah. didn’t expect politicizing wearing mask, protests “open economy”, bullshit. think gonna get worse since flu season back getting colder Dude, that's 3.3%. matter dress it, US *horribly*. trick treat stations inside house backyard. kids knock door say trick treat, get candy. We're finishing evening movie night. getting candy part important stuff anyway. I'm sure find something fill gap year. :) 😂😂😅 That’s whole lot stupid entitled. house? guessing no. People put lot money houses keep value up. bought fixer-upper house. deserve make money house money spent it. different anything else. put money something make money it. roof head protection elements something denied inherit it, build yourself, find work enough terrible economy afford whatever around.

Building house costs money. plumbers, carpenters, electricians need get paid work build house. Also, someone can't afford house, probably can't afford upkeep. means house waste away. seen homes owned people can't afford keep up. Floors rotting, roof coming apart, etc. 

There affordable housing there. ""cool"" areas. one final last gasp, Conservatives become hated minority always talking about, destroying everything get hands Hang people!! Stay strong stay safe!! gotta keep everyone safe!!!! guys! hear? pandemic over! tyrant

You sound like one who's brain turned off. likely not, we'll suffering consequences years. Yeah turning corner like walking dead around every corner large horde zombies \#1! Jokes you! We’re rounding corner! give example please? Oh don’t worry meant NEXT Easter . Teeny tiny one: Melb Australia mega-lockdown tamp outbreak, modelling hit anticipated figure (5 cases/ 14 day rolling average) exactly day. Yeah, shocked us too. Science works.

4 Americans die Benghazi Hillary Clinton SecState? MASSACRE! DEMAND JUSTICE!

230,000 Americans die Trump's mishandling covid crisis? helped. is. I’ve read, isn’t pretty likely vaccine then? Yeah, people won’t get vaccine, enough probably it’ll slow climb rate. 

Or least hope. Serious question: craziness keeps couple months must lead herd immunity? used couple months, like mask recommendation. Victoria, Australia hit 0 cases. Speak yourself. woman work going pre-package candy paper bags 6 days. case anyone wondering, 100k day rate, still would take ~3300 days everyone test positive USA. You’re kidding, right? got downvoted actually wrong conservative estimate. took 6 days. sure point is. obvious US handle well. wrong. max 10/23. sounds like sad existence. Cheer up, buttercup! Things getting better better. I’ve wearing mask months preparation tomorrow!

And day after, I’ll practice next year mean. governments saying need stronger response. Still waiting response though... pediatricians odds air quality experts, hard Americans know science even anymore. maybe never knew first place. fatality rate (accurately) estimated 0.5-0.8%. Pretty lame call that; one uses term it’s it’s called. Lame would easier Thanos would snap Fair - retract last sentence last comment, guessing actual numbers. might want look word dictionary. Nothing Covid 19 pandemic ""unprecedented"". death rate extremely low, near 0 young. You’re much likely die something else. 100k woldometers. like watching Bitcoin charts!  May well supervolcano eruption giant meteor too, trick yeet throwing candy correct. What's opposite free falling? re-election Lt. governor. opening statement 2022 campaign Governor.

Like that's going work scared shitless screaming. country give hugs new year next day whoever u didnt hug countdown

Lol think they’re genuine saying didn’t intend “may may happening” part focus. 

Rather, main thrust “fuck health happiness others”. That’s apparently cogent point. Define ""new normal"".

Like new normal wearing mask sick, heck wrong that? I'm it.

It really comes people mean it. Alright, tough guy. you. hope find happiness feel need anonymously act unkindly others. ❤️ prime, man understand. like beasts-they perish. [100,000 cases per Actually, *is* job ... e.g. making sure minorities oppressed occasionally killing them. law would give feds authority? Belgium number 1! Take USA hope inevitable 100K cases per day gets people wear masks take seriously. Remember shocked anything? could announce aliens exist tomorrow wouldn’t even surprised. enter winter soon, we’d practically rejoice could get back 50k day (which still way much).

It’s crazy fast get desensitized given epidemiological state situation worsens routinely break records one another.

I wonder long it’ll someone says “remember shocked first 100k cases back fall?” supreme court done stacked they'll feel however republicans want to. Comparatively, yes. I'm pointing revolutionary. think something experts couldn't. Yes 4 experts. Congratulations. got something right. However consensus among experts excess deaths higher tested. dock quarantines, literally give fuck anymore. state live? crazy people side need guns left. Seriously, buy gun learn use it. Im saying need automation first priority availability medical care. need 'hero nurses/doctors' end spreading virus families coworkers robots capable caring covid patients. large task one probably requires many iterations, even discussed federal level.

So basically ""effective"" Homemade masks impossible make Average people. don’t even know said People predicting 100k end year two months early. would put money 200k 250k per day end year. keeps jumping fast lately.  Wait, what!? Oookkk. Sure, that's sounds like great idea...in middle pandemic...in middle another wave spiking...yea. What's sad even people covid-19 bored social distancing people listen anyway.   mean Chuck Norris would stand virus, whole thing would over. confidently predicted yesterday would *not* happen till next week earliest. first time whole shitty year *too optimistic* predictions.

I feel good sign... predicted winter going suck ass.

We’re even winter yet. Holy shit. Parson definitely still idiot. Perhaps Trump confused Jesus's Resurrection Day Second Coming? Dude we're getting 9/11 twice week. horrific. I'm many moments silence I'd already like forget. He'd proud Trump. Stay safe guys. much make fun like gonna lie, first little bit That's wrong. fallen disinformation. 6% death certificates comorbidity. comorbidities listed directly resulted virus like respiratory failure pneumonia.

Only 76.4% underlying conditions. See could clear up. I’m arguing that. There’s chance happen. reading websites local candidates (I’m ID) number candidates websites referenced China virus personal freedoms regarding masking horrifying. Well shit. Let sign death certificates. day even over. D: coming place there's high positivity rate. 3 7 deaths Brooklyn alone came one town, Bensonhurst. 2 Borough Park. weekly averages. even 1-day stats judge legal team thinks legal. case Judge orders county something.

Texas Government Code § 418.1015(a), County Judge serves
as Emergency Management Director County El Paso (the “County”);

http://www.epcounty.com/documents/Order-No-13.pdf

This judge elected official (highest ranking one county) also Emergency Management Director. code give ""Emergency Management Director"" sweeping powers. many healthy coughs identify correctly? many false positives? No. no.  

None hypothetical outcomes follow premise.  plugged idea model looks like one simple policy would reduce covid deaths 300k US. Well keep fighting good fight district person careful, teacher buddy came many colleagues question - accurate numbers? Personally, use worldmeters covid data, website stack up? would reliable one? population, divide population density too! wake up. religions cults. outdoor space too. lot heating outside too. Almost tested half country. shit level sometime soon Anti-intellectualism America roof see.

\*mentally crosses Mexico Rate deaths cases down, great news credit medical people, overall deaths heading roof regardless... probably did, testing capacity. Deaths much much lower back April. Indigenous People's Day 

Lol accurate forehead thermometers?

My temperature tested store visited today, outside cold good half hour. skin temperature 98.6 F (37 C). I'm sure core temperature normal. ounce prevention worth pound cure. guess found decent drugs fight virus well  certainly another option. Well PA supposed cluster fuck live lehigh county got say easier bureaucratic nonsense I've do. Hopefully dumbfucks catch it. think mind breathe bother anybody anymore.   means death rate.

Yes, smarts may decline too. again, Friday, let's cut slack.  Unbelievable. Anyone remember mid-Dec ""5 new cases strange virus \_\_\_\_\_\_ Province, China""? idea I’m middle school science teacher. think lot variables besides vitamin deficiency. 

The vitamin May causation, may correlation one variables. too. something 3 am. last two years, would suffer random bouts anxiety intense agitation. True ""agitation"" worse pain. wanted rip skin off. I'd wake around 3 drive. I'd go Walmart wander aisles freaks take mind away feeling. felt somewhat like times meth 20 years ago. without pleasure. I'd finally pass exhaustion around 8 am. Agitation hellish.

During time I'd also started taking cbd relaxant. eventually realized agitation caused strange bowel constipation feeling core body. Hard describe. believe cbd caused that. 

So last January quit cbd, started breakfast/dinner routine Metamucil fiber. experienced 3 agitation episodes since. Weird story that's happened. Fiber good. 230k 0, lot know, probably typo somewhere, let time check white paper two golf shots trying regain credibility. America First !!! Road 100 million, let's go! It’s declining however infections roof still screwed statistically. agree extent still refuses put state wide mask mandate place moved Idaho back “phase 3” “modified” bars still open long table seating kids much still school despite areas “red”. Previous plans said “red” meant back online learning. they’re saying schools seem handling well they’ll let kids keep going. quite Romney enough still depends anti-maskers re-elect him. Lt Gov piece work. Deaths aren’t decline death rate is. However, solely due patients access improving care.  seeing cities, healthcare system getting capacity. point death rate goes back people can’t get access treatment. case fatality rate (we're catching way cases testing way medical treatments improved). actual daily number deaths increasing quite significantly. see 10k daily deaths recorded first time end November. going bring dead back life? going even bury them? fucking think so. Financial problems dealt recovered from. Death, much. Get empathy. gets dicks hard tbh. interesting question. 

What think? 40% come from?  Ironic it’s Halloween WE’RE # 1! Yup, are. US head start all, well control Europe Americas.

People resistant lockdown measures, sure going slow anytime soon think right, numbers dropped people relaxed. Fauci talking getting 100k around time numbers dropped back 25k-30k mark, saying numbers still high could bounce back again. quarantine good girl watching Hannibal. critical mass population. daily situations. measure effect, doctors work covid patients without getting sick. colleague cruise booked February smh idea bad Argentina. Terrible. :(

Are there, Argentina? family? I'm sorry you/they Argentina started surging August study ended. end study, Argentina 215K covid cases 10k deaths.

Argentina mass-dosed ivermectin, AFAIK. it? country-level deaths 28K healthcare workers infected 10% dead

Of 28K healthcare workers infected, many ivermectin-carrageenan protocol?

I willing follow logic, present facts apply.

Edit: [This indicates ivermectin *not* widely used Argentina.

(Translated English browser)

""It reveals us use ivermectin, already shown effective, authorized""

It appears recent interview (the article published 2020-10-18). happened Argentina since study done changed Dr. Carvallo's confidence value ivermectin protocol. ridiculous Supreme court could care less. disenfranchised voters, think pretty clear decades, hell centuries country. May 31, 2009, George Tiller, physician Wichita, Kansas nationally known one doctors United States perform late-term abortions, murdered [christian]Scott Roeder, anti-abortion extremist. Tiller killed Sunday morning service church, Reformation Lutheran Church, serving usher. Tiller previously survived assassination attempt Shelley Shannon shot arms.

should discuss bombings? ""followers"" Yeah. People huge American Hate boner ignoring parts world rates abysmal. Belgium perfect example. Jesus fucking Christ. people making fun people masks listening professions/facts yet ironically ones probably taking right precautions ignoring facts &amp; statistics. Peru death rate 1000 per million. countries collapsing heavily economically socially lets ignore state world focus rubbing one US. 

Yikes. masks work anti maskers complain make harder breathe less airflow? complaint show serving intended purpose limiting airflow face? easy breathe without one could see argument worthless but... USA number 1! better though. look rates France, Spain, Italy ratios US we'd 125k cases more. better leaders 100% committed making sure US number 1 unlike past presidents never virus Olympic gold medal! lake Yellowstone moving ground going places. Seems like warning me. estimated 200k dead time back February. 100% correct pandemic assumptions far except this.

My dumbass thought federal government would done something rather nothing.

We're 200k dead numbers rising instead falling.

Imma real pissed covid still thing get first gray pube. Unfortunately, much convenient guys girls. hate peeing wild. Death numbers lag assume . could also treatment protocol better . hospitals get overwhelmed death numbers get worse.  know check treat town. trick treating app made candy companies It’s Trump administration. aren’t anything it. Yes dreams come true. lord biden save us horrible plague live happily ever  #1 world USA USA USA *cough* USA USA USA 


/s WoooHooo!!! World Record!!!........Fuck fair point many cops decent speak out, don't. ""Woah, uncivil person who's indirectly advocating kill people, denying reality dangers exist?"" 

That's real politehitler.jpg shit. home isn’t probably issue. You’ll getting school work.  tends bit lag. First cases go up. 2ish weeks later hospitalizations go up. 2 weeks that, death goes up. 1,000 deaths today positives month ago. going get lot worse. 

There real treatments. monoclonal antibodies convalescent plasma helpful, it’s “supportive”. Unlike antibiotics kill target bacteria, body needs respond virus. It’s good. I'm sorry? 

I mean I'll help explain something specific tripping statement broken otherwise ambiguous. happen visiting back home OH, turns it’s also neighborhood trick treating, lack masks shocking. you’re going trick treat...at least safe it. Better treatment matter can't control growth rate eventually outpaces capacity hospitals. Elizabeth tower, big ben man lives inside tower. There's always tomorrow Yeah, bingo card. Mass civil unrest too.. 

*looking good* Biden's gonna fun first hundred days office. Hell, he's going spend entire term dealing economic fallout. Talk second term killed crib. lol announce fixed ecosystem there.

Nice fuck planet. waves look cases state link showed you.

Irony is, Russia hurt helping get Trump election, Hillary Clinton office, wuld virus. source?  virus can't controlled US. Federal government going try per Trump's ""leadership"". ...we’re number one? [screenshot press Practical position? none. purely political move. 2000 new cases today. Damn immigrants clogging healthcare system killing people ! 
Meanwhile... Don’t worry it’s everywhere, Americans better worse anyone else sad. Within month it'll closer 150k nonsense persists. Isn’t also lowest daily death rate since March? Herd immunity 35-40% population.  gun, Bible flag. needs burning cross hits GOPs talking points. en there's people right now, second, saying big deal.

It really though. deaths = jobs available = cheaper housing = smaller environmental impact. Corona Virus best thing economy planet we've ever had. DFW's next, we're 90% ICU bed capacity already. Making America Great 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻⭐️🌟⚡️🇺🇸💖❤️💓🇺🇸 unacceptable people, happens people trust politicians scientists  give usually warnings. know chances Yellowstone erupting zero warning is, I'm sure pretty close zero seen friends gone groceries since started, canceled wedding too. However going pass candy... Setting table driveway individual cellophane wrapped packages candy hand sanitizer available. I'm hoping that's enough precaution, I'm sick asshole COVID deniers eating seeing friends everything want many us making sacrifices. San Francisco great conservatives say shit hole! WTF?!?! Ah well, use absolute numbers instead cases per 100k?
In normalized numbers us far behind france, uk, austria ...  Lol increasing every week. Soon peak winter comes 200k+ new daily cases. remember people think scam. first bump bump ignorance. second bump BLM bump. third bump bound Election bump. Whoa whoa whoa....tricking still perfectly safe egg toilet paper houses hearts content. Biggest one day increase....so far stories, god, commandments 

muslims waiting jesus, messiah, return earth defeat antichrist.

you obviously absolutely idea that. Ah, ""you can't save literally every single person even bother trying all"" argument.

A classic. everything, allowed anything. It’s serious WH long gone replaced sycophants. Wow thought way would hit 100k election  Meanwhile hombre naranjado says fake news blowing up, new guy takes covid-19 won’t talked about. friends entire family got covid going pumpkin patch. Luckily nothing two days sniffles 7 people (grandma grandpa included) still... gloomy this. closer vaccine every day, death rates arent flying charts, Kovid Karens got everyone wear mask sometimes kinda. 

See? Looking up. USA! USA! 🤦🤦🤦 freeze pay got COVID-19 (my whole family) cold air hurts..... im thankful we're still ok...but im little grateful got winter flu season. 

Winter gonna scary time. go ahead let neighborhood children put hands dozens shared candy bowls.

I thought *known* fomites (contaminated surfaces) significant source infections. true?  ironic? Unless people financially supported, it’s enacted actual force (the military maybe?), Lockdown almost certain backfire spectacular fashion. Even latter option (assuming you’re ok iron fist measures) , you’d still stomach idea enforcement body likely engaging shootouts armed civilians. 

I don’t think even Biden would touch national Lockdown without getting financials order well advance (and large, hurried stimulus bill come 2021 could herald said lockdown). Federal law passed congress would supercede state law. tomorrow Halloween can’t spell Coronavirus without USA. I'm confused (and Canadian)...so media gets numbers trust states, states get numbers hospital data filtered? Ya liberal wants talk logic....lol thats funny.  wait Thanksgiving! turning coomers. Ohh bolded something means *must* actually mean something...

It's really silly though shit purpose. make claims leave enough potential vagueness say ""oh joke"" ""oh that's meant.""

It's 100% meant. 1. Subsidize groceries. everyone stock 2 weeks. Tell stores government pay back later. 

2. Enforce 2 week quarantine EVERYONE. doctor EMT keeping water/power on, army forcing back home.

3. Repeat army case picked enforcing everyone else. Trumpettes believe it. That's total cases many Asian countries. also never develop Object Permanence? really believe CCP told truth? 😐 credible allegations. Bidens shitty candidate. Trumps shittier candidate. Trumps shittiness cancel Bidens. worked Kerrville couple days week, left last night saw two bars side side full parking lots.  remember reading PPE loses lot effectiveness positive test rate goes 1%. like 7% lol cult survives long enough gets enough followers gets ""upgraded"" religion.

The ""differences"" ""guidelines"" made established religions want reduce number competitors get. try paint contenders fake. Turns Trump religion different all, even name 1 character bible. I’m 8months leaving house curbside pickups

This ridiculous definition ‘you problem’ ‘them problem’. Mine shoulder mounted hydraulic powered!  mean, asking logistically unfeasible accomplish every level. Let alone mass hysteria that's bound follow something comment make think believed nonsense? America everything bigger lot kids. Halloween party. hid candy Halloween style “Easter eggs” hid them. Kids fun dressing looking “eggs”/little pumpkins. like Easter Halloween. piñata behalf yourself, OK? That's diseases infectious work. measures taken stem tide, keeps spreading accelerating pace. Actually, today lot deaths Covid. Almost record. WorldMeters 7490. last time high back April. highest amount deaths day far 8514 (April 17th). daily death count rising last days. Two days ago 7048. Yesterday 7116. Seems climbing.  


What find odd, usually record high global cases, goes back next day. case last days. We've three days record global highs: Oct 28th - 508,000. Oct 29th - 548,000. Today - 573,000.  


You mentioned America - wonder much new mutated strain Covid America now. probably getting here. new mutated strain supposedly what's hitting Europe seems contagious before. I'm cooking four 18 lb turkeys Thanksgiving. california know people Throw candy kids. Trick yeet future. afford stock up, do. soaring COVID rates stock market dip week that's evidence need. Okay glad know it. Definitely takes massive weight shoulders Yeah USA good so... twice good good enough. ship state one leaks top. Exactly. Like ""oh no, go netting $300,000 year $275,000. ever shall do?!!!?!!?""

And worst part is, 99% people screeching even make 50k year, let alone 400. perception bad enough go hospital, you’re probably getting back urn. Supposedly, hospitals charging something around $50k US get admitted additional $5k day. 

It’s real bad. Large metro areas getting hit particularly hard enforcing stricter measures like temperature checking. many places outside major metro areas running business usual many people need set shop starve. likely anticipate Administration would be, intents purposes, working increase cases. First time active cases 3 million OP saying care, they're saying need socially distance, wear mask, wash hands frequently. point lockdowns sake hospitals. matter we, average person do, going solve issue rampant trump cultists regular idiots.

OP saying still take caution without wasting life away idiots. There's real reason stay home 8 months go lengths stated, bare minimum (masks, hand washing, social distancing) statistically helps spread covid part. r/Coronavirus. many greatest seven months lives. So, COVID-19 zombies might farfetched all... Could Easter Bunny make early spooky visit? she’s old enough Rise Guardians could back credibility(holiday personages helping out), plus it’d occupy while. one  Buy vouchers. Hopefully landslide Republicans feel pressured distance Trump crazy anti-science approach this. Maybe even 25th amendment gets bad enough. Europe hasnt nearly many deaths per capita. aim lockdown kepe health system collapsing eradicating virus There's way 7% people infected.

0.1% likely. people get likely spread. everyone US got virus would shit ton deaths reason ? US #1. Thanks TRUMP!!!! break arm I'm duct taping cause can't afford hospital bills. almost like comments thread day saying people yelled us accused us listening science need. lame duck period, outgoing president can't issue pardons executive orders.  love idea person handing candy uses sanitizer handling candy Giant BBQ tongs seem popular, too. deaths going down? exactly they're right since Trump already ""immune"" basically care covid anymore..? talking weather today? Dear Italy, never beat USA, please stop trying. Well said, wishing best confess I'm going small gathering tomorrow. Halloween favorite shit every year. I've strong compliance since beginning thing. Fourth July, Thanksgiving, Christmas, cancelled. I'm point.

If people want 100% isolate 1-2 years, well, guess I've learned won't. They'll settle working home, going store, going gym, going all, seeing parents year, meeting new people etc .. . using ventilators instead use oxygen machine 

drugs like steroids 

just better around health care strategies professionals learn treat it.  don’t think many countries world laugh. Maybe 5-6. One responsible whole situation. Oh agree, people contagious they're pre-symptomatic (because they're socially distancing), testing/contact tracing basically non existent point. People households likely know they're infected isolate late. humidifier small expense drastically reduce risk. People living homes multiple generations vulnerable family members absolutely grab one. He's vacation. Leave message beep safe, dont stupid. start trouble breathing, dont wait call help. Jail? That’s getting easy China. like hard labor camp, better yet...no one ever sees again. You’re getting owned responses huh half time instead shoot rotten egg it. trick part works... hospitalizations increase every single day

The hospitalizations much higher April May. cases going higher, number hospitalizations deaths much lower. rocking shit like NBA players Olympics! Death rate low though. It’s much threat back March never thought I'd find living situation people trick treating spite. Weird times, man. think India peaked 100k, snake oil sell you. Given sheer size population, manipulation recently leading suspicious steep drop cases, highly unlikely fewer 100k per day big spike state mad selfish people still going trunk treats, still planning trick treat groups tomorrow night, weddings, parties, going kinds non-essential fall activities would love I’m trying responsible safe.

Stop feeding trumplets I'm thinking Biden presidency even wins electoral college. Trump installed cronies Supreme Court there's stopping handing election Trump like Bush v.

Like 400 fine, living like royalty, earn little higher tax. horror. overflowing hospitals videos? People dropping streets? restaurants packed cinemas opened?? 2,000,001st death become pro life? 1. enforced mask mandate teeth
2. give fourteen ""5 dollar"" covid tests per person two weeks one leaves house test positive
3. national guard provide one month worth food every house anyone elderly preexisting conditions caring must nice. leaders want die win election. fits budget look sous vide setup cannabutter. whole process lot neater, predictable, less stinky, don’t feel guilty around kids :) Eh, trump still rallies thousand people minimum mask. Biden also rallies smaller number. Thanksgiving around corner

The number go even higher next weeks.. highest number active cases Victoria 7,877 August! feel pain fellow East Valley parent 4yr old. Thank you. She’s alright now. post said one principals voting is, quote, “Tax Paying Americans” Here's link source CDC worry there's still safe spaces internet us Freethinkers want completely free Chinese propaganda. Reddit one them. Please leave. countries acted early contained virus, continue monitor travel outbreaks keep [death low. hundred times lower US. US much Europe failed act, everywhere. probably remain like common flu, much deadly.  case haven’t noticed.....I’m kinda voice truth sub. great yet? better way spread aerosols going door door yelling trick treat! Spooky! open back cases rise everywhere else. I’ve become numb big numbers. They’re me, could’ve sworn hit 97,000 day months ago  Possibly South Dakota, Republican Party whole. basing timing estimates on? speaking actual expertise - like - trying understand this? Ehhh restaurant manager VT here....it's honestly pretty simple. system self-explanatory, customers show up, take 20 seconds write info down, host places folder end night, rinse repeat. Sometimes people ask why, tell required state Vermont. like go elsewhere exact issue, anyone refuse. There's bigger burden virus itself, stuff small sacrifice keeping doors open. CDC said recently Take heart, 50%, like 25% they're loud. There's another group necessarily bow GOP still easily swayed nebulous talk ""freedom"" ""liberty"" ""oppressed"" mask rules forced business closures, quite cult Trump yet. 

They getting though, look people like Joe Rogan can't go single episode without bringing ""draconian"" response California. bullshit, response essentially ""Every county gets decide handle themselves, here's strong recommendations"" recommendations made assumption Republican federal government *absolutely fuck us* refusing provide proper stimulus would pay everyone's wages block mortgage rent payments several months everyone regardless work status. 

That right there, giving *everyone* money even they're still able work also granting *everyone* amnesty rent mortgage utility payments would bigger boost economy anything else could do, do. amount tax breaks billionaires megacorps would ever much revitalize economies dying cities towns across country. would never that, dealing bullshit almost year later *never* see long game, ever think short term led allow states relaxed response made states took seriously look ""draconian"" comparison, made Party believe could politicize issue rile base run-up election. Interesting. specific reason considered second wave? guess I'm thinking major ""spike"" like wave seems I'm mistaken. know humans achieve herd immunity Covid? herd immunity HIV common cold viruses we? Also 2-3 weeks quarantine works virus' incubation period long. HIV affects years. WANT GO SEE DUNE THEATERS. GET SHIT TOGETHER. Japan test frequently. still blame cdc flip flopping masks. Could said, okay okay safe wear cloth one, save medical ones professionals, actively discouraged mask use are.

Yeah that's issue. could've used massive platform push science: wear masks, social distance, listen experts, etc. could've also pushed McConnell funding help American people get lockdowns, RBG's death could've said I'm nominating anyone pass another stimulus bill.

Honestly, would've done half things would've rally around flag effect he'd leading Biden right now.

Well, one true technical sense word. also keep telling sleep night.  choice now, would gladly trade strict 11 week lock year misery.



bUt wAnT SEe FaMIly!!!

lmao see family might seeing ever  Nah. They've convinced others thing sorts fake need anything one incentive anything. See: local new's facebook page. Every time new numbers reported, people scream fake news.  make sense though... bare moment, testing March/April time frame. tests vastly readily available now. capabilities amount testing March/April timeframe, would probably even higher numbers would may ultimately show 2nd wave experiencing probably lower experienced March/April. Though think deaths may telling number data though. 

I doubt Trump anyone camp meant manner.

Nevertheless, American, really need implement mask policy take direction scientists... it’s pretty sad. it! Oregon anything goes crazy. guess expecting sort behavior people *and* government. still people thinking wearing mask makes breathing problems, violates freedom, makes look ""weak"". people, causing harm themselves, others well, appropriate action taken government, but...

I'm really worried probably already late realize bad virus spreading across US. every person concerned virus, 2 others give shit. think that's real problem. costume part PSA encourage children stay safe Halloween activities. Kids also going pandemic. lucky business home, live forest, spend 10x time two young boys wife. 

I’m probably rare dare say benefiting... far. Implying CCP's reported data actually accurate? Nice joke mate Pacific Northwest, major city. Zilch. lockdowns. People heavily favor lockdowns typically WFH techies, spouses WFH workers, students financially supported parents. words, people unaffected lockdowns advocate it. That’s true always, sadly. got covid weeks ago idea where. always wear mask eat outside. They're ranked 42nd education, 44th high school graduates 50th citizens Bachelor's degree. 

You're white knighting god damned Arkansas. We're turning type corner global climate change. Ok wtf stonks That’s roughly long I’ve alone house. ""secondary infection rate"" 53%. (The secondary infection rate percentage exposed people catch COVID-19 first case.) 

About 75% secondary infections occurred within five days first household member getting sick. fear already late. imagine climatologists pretty scary conversations lately. Winter That’s exactly it. media reports stop earlier. Lol nope wrong. would absolutely “stop tracks” that’s disingenuous say. Let’s forget prevented jurisdictions (ATL, Tybee Island) passing measures executive order. 

Tybee Island didn’t want reopen beaches. State Executive Order forced to. much party “local control” “small government”. mean saying April America would hit that? predicted it'd hit end year?

I actually wonder far that'd former action taken. China R0 value 2.5 early on. Unless math wrong cause I'm brainfart, average person passed within 2 weeks, 50 people brought country, hitting 100k day within something like 6 weeks. course, people would getting sick dying, people would begin following procedures cautioned CDC some. much winning everything seem fine? number COVID cases going back record numbers it’s even winter yet. get combination flu season mixed COVID it’s going shit show. work emergency department amount COVID patients seeing rapidly going up. wish could confident people stubbornly continue exact wrong even immense pressure. whole pandemic done nothing unpleasantly surprise area far. make excellently articulated well-sourced points. preaching choir? read actual post? I'm really praying hard right next 3 months pass low deaths possible. bullet left gun now. late exponential growth covid pulled back. Winters going make big issue US. Everybody mask f*** up. Breaking records baby wooooooo “we’re number 1, we’re number 1, suck Italy!” *scrolling Reddit*

Hmm 97k, new record

I live somewhere has. Taking seriously March means lives back normal ages. Fuck lies. stupidity strong. Ofc ur downvoted Halloween becoming reality every day. know what's really draconian? Letting 1,000 Americans die day President trash administration keep saying big deal

Of days, US hit 100K cases 1K deaths, refusal take measures idiotic notion ""FREEDUMB"" killing people. always freedom, never responsibility Based evidence. follow science, conspiracy theories, exactly Trump admin. relentlessly sought discredit FDA, CDC, etc. listen former CDC heads, matter administration hired under, call Trump's mishandling virus, current appointees, Fauci, Birx, etc., medical degree, reality TV show. End subject.  Olympics still 2020 see *dose backwards 360 taliwhip

   YEET economy made people. separate things. choice never either save lives save economy. choice table save many lives possible reduce covid much possible... economy would come back strong.
Bit like China... quite countries.
Instead narrative driven politicians, sponsors, billionaires corporations must save economy priority. whatever loss life occurs unavoidable.
This resulted hundreds thousands deaths crippled economy. Crippled safety well-being people time low. part people wish consume risk personal health involved. Oh fuck trick treaters year. Scroll down.

Knowing weakness, sent wave wave men reached limit shut down. Fauci, show medal won."" Nuke places like. Like Portland I've felt Easter bellwether holidays winter going go. feel Easter pretty much bs holiday, nobody spends year excited go easter brunch family. Thanksgiving Christmas, however, different stories. 

&amp;#x200B;

And saw batshit people months pandemic Easter, flocked gather together holiday typically see massive turnouts. Add plus legit family/travel holidays, people feeling cooped better part year winter going absolute shitshow america I'm trying start isolating completely within next weeks try ride shit out. didn’t Biden call governors get together make plan?

...says President United States Vastly overstated number long shot. Everything labeled covid death.hit truck motorcycle rona....guess what.

Look heart disease, look cancer. 

Or stay house, watch cnn cry smh don’t kill 400K Americans year.

So sure they’re similar, like crashing brick wall 20mph 100mph similar... Russian hackers attacking US hospitals’ computer infrastructure happening WH literally nothing. Fascinating always aggregate cases reported headlines positive test proportion. 

Oldest trick book arguing bad faith using statistics. help prevent confusion, add /s end it? No. Fuck Trump. 

If buffoon knowing well advance serious pandemic continuing lie public downplay virus 220,000+ people would Thanksgiving Christmas families year. 

It’s fucked did. never hate bone body Trump sat Oval Office. Fuck him. There’s special place hell no, doesn’t come golden toilet. expect... we've given up. half cases closed everything march. opened shit way early, people simply care. are. like homework. one class homeowner failing test, still want pass class. fiancé Romanian - talking trying go summer I’m like????????? Finishing 2020 BANG! Honestly former too. Pretty sure they'll blame Biden even loses. Even Biden win might happen late January. Same, friends party tomorrow I’m going. think I’m overreacting. One nursing school working hospitals clinical... live aging parents dad getting heart surgery next month. absolute mess is, infections deaths straining relationships people disagreeable. Mission accomplished Fingers crossed seems slowing little Canada recent spike...

Not looking forward next months US. Trump either wins nightmare likely loses tries burn everything way out. Meanwhile dumbasses partying Halloween... Thanksgiving weeks... holiday season weeks that. gonna brutal already really bad now.

Our spike Canada least partially Thanksgiving (happened 2 weeks Oct 14th). link 2020 data charts, 2019 True. Idiots always exist guess. lived midwest waiting happen. ""Taking care sissies"", attitude 70s, still is, apparently. don’t believe would true. Sure people wouldn’t wear mask, would small topic nobody would even talk it. Trump reason wear mask cult ate nothing brainwashed. Friend tested positive covid went back family today college (?????)

And others throwing parties tonight without masks they’re medium sized.

Our civilization doesn’t learn. Hold second, actual Trump quote? Lmao. agree Exactly. law. extremely vague executive order highly questionable seen full holes. Also point said tweet comes Ken Paxton whose opinion legality *extremely* questionable. government officials aren’t thing it, even thought it’s reckless assuming many people social distancing threat ending (because people aren’t social distancing should, mostly leaders abandoned us) New Zealand &amp; Australia pretty much virus free now. took measures early listened medical experts. Sweden? Well...He botch testing blocked states scaling labs, knowing dangerous contagious was, publically pretending contained, allowing spread amongst vulnerable populations silently. Then, badgered states opening without precautions, causing surge south Sunbelt. downplayed masks mitigations, withheld funding testing, wrote CDC guidance, etc., leading this. injecting bleach, one study found U.S. 100K preventable deaths. That's blood directly hands. Dan detractors, held head losing (particularly last days)! generally, state law trumps county law. governor issued order saying open up, individual counties cant override it. Aussie here. 

Population: 25.5M
Total COVID Cases far: 27,582

So 1,082 cases per million 0.108% total population. Crucially, cases areas US hit really before. Uk widespread testing missing 50-70% cases actually can't believe granted we've come take science.

People trashing scientists science general giant SUV typing iPhone, sipping chemical compound called Frappe. 

Like, see ridiculousness hypocrisy situation? mask wearing countries spiraling control? like moral bankruptcy. yeah we're going get there. work medical lab, COVID testing pressed absolute max months. Constant supply shortages. I'm high enough know what's going seems like daily struggle get swabs run 24 hour TAT. We're really good people coming hospital though. everyone gets sorted quickly. post wrong link? see said. Apologies friend. hope well. 

 I'm sales rep talk hundreds people week. Like people, I've talking covid since first came around anyone tell know someone whose it. Maybe coincidence effected it. Strange think even rate would take 10 years reach heard immunity went 198 225. Part daughter born right qurantine happened. wife ripped open made pick tp help out. constantly house. still wasnt bad June went east visit folks. eat unhealthy got caught it. 2 weeks. came back home longer could fit jeans wanted bang head. feel super uncomfortable havent able motivate work like used smh Fuck. I'm apartment building neighbors hall 20+ people party walking hallways masks. guess show's getting started... Weirdly, back 35 years ago, canvassing old buy gold silver, one woman brought daguerreotype man said Joseph Smith. beady eyes, like bat hit him. appeared unintouch ethics, like Trump. wanted sell it. pay wanted. Church refused buy it. belief want associate real Joseph Smith. weird. compared Russian roulette covid. HUGE difference survival rates. take calculated risks I’ll take chances virus survival rate. Can't negative cases let's say unsigned give us whole 4.29 billion. proven ACB. one, tired ""winning"". 47 states increasing moment. election right now. It'll get much worse two weeks. voted early dropping absentee ballot. ever saw poll workers. everyone options had. comment fact based? easy start #1 cases #1 deaths. wait Thanksgiving + Christmas holiday period. 

I would like say things ""heating up"" things getting colder scarier. thank parents every opportunity get coming did, $50 pockets, bag clothes, building foundations siblings me. good planet without us? 2nd amendment written for, know, reasons. gosh darn wild west Actually, said deaths cases. 225,000 deaths. modeling tells us we’re going get hundred thousand get Fauci predicted 100k mark is. Yet almost half country wants head stake. worldometers always different?  something worth pound cure specific website? *don't*. link form data tell.

But... really care you? automatically assume information filtered government.

And understand little better mean; *really* wanted too, every hospital US could report numbers every news station country time report state.

It impossible government fudge numbers way European countries... yours. Wisconsin’s positivity rate far week north 30%. 

Like fuck Awww cat Wally, Stop! Stop! He's already dead! Even ""just flu,""

#The flu fucking dangerous 87 year old! Hello fellow Floridian May ask you’re dealing with? went whole adulthood somewhat manageable chronic illness severe rare autoimmune disorder that’s upended life, empathize. Nah, said speed increase cases would stay constant would 20k daily cases Christmas. point 2k cases day. really prediction, giving warning bad spot even then. 

### Summary

**What already known topic?**

Transmission SARS-CoV-2 occurs within households; however, transmission estimates vary widely data transmission children limited.

**What added report?**

Findings prospective household study intensive daily observation ≥7 consecutive days indicate transmission SARS-CoV-2 among household members frequent either children adults.

**What implications public health practice?**

Household transmission SARS-CoV-2 common occurs early illness onset. Persons self-isolate immediately onset COVID-like symptoms, time testing result high risk exposure, time positive test result, whichever comes first. household members, including index case, wear masks within shared spaces household. computational biologist, mostly surprised happen sooner. exactly worried 7 months. fuck? country?? Thanks yeah, agree.

Earlier week puking brains crazy body aches, thought might food poisoning initially nausea, diarrhea, headaches pain taking deep breath persisted went got tested.

Today feel lot better luckily shortness breath I'm waiting test results. agree I’m not. think people Southeast Asia remember Russia failed? remember USA, China maybe UK. That’s that’s problem. I’d like pathetic leaders west get head asses get shit together. USA, UK, France, Canada etc. suck. make difference. much else help significant way. Dude absolute coward something may impact shot re-election.

Make sure impact shot re-election. love socialism. wish couple trips dentist instead hospital fair enough. realize sub much Europeans Different states different ways measuring positive cases tests. Covid Tracking wrote great blog post exact situation imagined. gist consistency states getting national positivity number super meaningful. Comparing across states meaningful either. Comparing state useful assuming changed way measurement. sure. think advisors, doctors, scientists whatnot say too. president acts completely alone. However, seen countries apply methods helped flatten curve Trump downplayed it. buck stop somewhere right? also beyond odd. How? people people calling Obama foreigner. Placing blame one man type people delusional. always there. get attention. Thats literally whats going happen...

This developed nation going work/ Flu subtly, subtly, encouraged...  Apparently even easier give fuck. exit ramp incoming traffic. Testing far widespread now, result cases. deaths rising similar fashion, means virus safer might think (more less).

Here's chart daily cases, one daily deaths. Cases started rising September, deaths leveled [Mission Australian came one strict lock downs world, I'd rather America going Exactly, people think wearing mask political now, wait Biden mandates never said wasn't. still infectious virus. death rate getting lower people show symptoms It’s grotesque. You’d amazed mental gymnastics rationalize. amazes terrifies people understand authoritarian even means. Really? Melbourne went winter, lockdown, masks, FUCK flu/colds related illnesses compared years pretty much nobody wore masks Asian people there.

So yes, living proof lockdowns masks work, even winter. Maybe US give go, certainly can't make situation worse now. never even opinion Belgium this. National mask mandate complete shutdown month thing stop shit. dead covid, severe economic/social depression, debt bankruptcy, social disorders, mortgage loan rent default, reluctance chronic patients go hospital seek urgent care, lack medical supplies. Covid high survival rate, lack safety net caused Great Depression (no social security/medicare) Great Recession (no deferral loans/subprime loan collapse) COVID Triple Crown Hello Malaysian brethren. Also live ☺️ town area drive trick treat haunted trail type thing. encounter costumed actor would come out, interact kids. Windows course. place piece candy bags clipped door. pretty cool kids loved it. Yeah announced lockdown, night mass exodus city...some rural towns china dumped mounds dirt dump trucks roads leading in, guarded mobs keep outsiders out. remember less 10k cases there...and knew would significant one day changed reporting reported 15k day stunning! Watched lot hong kong press conferences dean medicine, smart man started sounding alarms...wish listened. sign world serious required drastic action. rest world bother listen, busy thinking better China, though virus cares nationality.

You can't negotiate virus; thing. That's like trying negotiate sea drowning. ""Fill every room warm bodies!"" 

-stupid people Trump finally failed limit testing. Health professionals finally enough testing policy

we've levels since mid July guarantee Trump Train brakes, currently derailing, taking America tolerating tolerance is? Interesting read. hope Coronavirus Task Force officials figure way diminish influence Dr Scott Atlas, lunatic views experience infectious disease epidemiology. Wisconsin's governor keeps trying keep mask mandates place people keep trying overthrow claiming ""you've already made ONE executive order term!"" run courts get denied. becomes ""Recall Tony Evers!!""

I live getting scary, circle people know infected growing smaller. guess general office company getting hit factories losing people quarantine there.

I told someone day administration quoted ""We anything pandemic"" asked ""What want happen?"" said, want cohesive plan. spotty assed, rules thee bullshit! want see nationwide mask mandate, want schools online only, want colleges closed online only, WANT FUCKING DIRECTION!! post doesn’t contribute high-quality information. Surely sit back it’s obvious he’s nothing spite, could face jail time negligent deaths. Surelyyy cop sat station watching prisoners dying day day cells without lifting finger surely that’s negligent Would like point daily death count higher total number fatalities across Australia throughout entire pandemic. like gun violence. nothing done it. muh waffles beer! Clearly problem stopped reporting it!

/s Lock sandcastle then. feel point, we're going fucking get it. False. Positivity accurate Covid tests ? Even common cold fever tested positive. ""Mission Accomplished"" people social distancing wearing masks!!! happening? 5x many infections reported. wow current administration literally doesnt give fuck. fucked. Winter round corner too. Gonna dark winter Murica. Dark indeed. try tacos instead. Cheaper tastier heard anything two, cancel everything? ""It’s perfectly fine self centered greedy people go there'
""oppression minorities""

Don't say that, half America want move there. 300k minimum dead 2020. deaths 1000+ daily. there’s delay it’s still rising. yeah 300 minimum, 325 likely, 350 possibly. like many democracies failed contain virus, many authoritarian states also failed. Russia done well, example.

Let's avoid trying support authoritarianism. worsening pandemic president mocks virus rallies, health agency scientists challenging administration’s approach ways small large whole lot bullshit. Loool. presume Trump dispute mail votes stay power It’s accurate say don’t know, erring side caution definitely best course action. issue also that's age group works public customer service jobs. spreading much exposed often. 
 Outside idiots partying course Natural herd immunity fringe science literally antivaxxers use justify beliefs. way achieve herd immunity vaccination hard lockdown months end. loud voices Reddit advocate belief. concern may cyclic infection, reinfection occurs, start killing young people. science new COVID even 12 months old yet. Take said Reddit grain salt even thousands upvotes. Listen Doctors scientists, like isolation, hand washing, masks avoid people. many know it

 care, literally traitors justify rationalize away part know damaging country threatening global stability never seriously sick endure humiliation interacting medical system know medical system works also completely unrealistic expectations matter healthy people idyllic idea go hospital problem correctly relatively promptly identified addressed. 

8+ 10 doctors poor working knowledge bodies work depth. special doctors know lot more. usually found large hospitals edge cases common active research done. Pray never get see one doctors do, case special want that. 

The research produced special doctors weaponized actionable diagnostic &amp; treatment protocols following rigid scientific methods make statistically likely see anomalies A, B C patient X apply protocol P specified followed case, patient X's condition improve Y.

Unfortunately, gigantic gap research common practice. Knowledge new protocols continuously disseminated towards common doctors human body subsystem complex practically way infer new knowledge using protocols common practice. result common doctors unable interpret moderate variations patient's blood imaging tests fact actively push back patients become alarmed metric bounds long metric corroborate others match diagnostic protocol. Basically, protocol matched multiple anomalies body, common doctors aggressively tell healthy fine despite feeling fine all. 

In cases presented article likely situation anomalies seen match diagnostic protocol. would've cases COVID-19 would exist, people would've told they're fine repeat scans 3, 6 12 months watch trends. situation get name TV elsewhere media superficially risk free interpreting anomalies, get see kinds nobodies yap matter, getting name producing panic among people know fact medical system commonly encounters ignores patients anomalies match diagnostic protocol. Positivity increasing well.  said anti-maskers, especially rural ones, letting get communities would otherwise decently insulated it. That's happens lots people bother care, even protect fellow countrymen (fuck claiming 'patriotic' knowingly putting country greater danger'), let go localized incident widespread ones. I'll let 76 year old father chronic COPD asbestosis know beat can! 

Thanks inspiration. even get snow live... power misinformation strong here. People immersed sources telling COVID overblown.


If Facebook Twitter shut month, would probably flatten case load. Fox shut it, could maybe even control virus. Yup exactly. Hello Phoenix well! people stuff like wouldn’t big deal folks neighborhood posting it’s full steam ahead like everything’s find “that’ll really show scaredy cat liberals!”Ugh. problem is, ""captain"" think boat sinking all. Individual treat bags? That's could think of, cancelling seems best approach. lot people calling law lol..... not. county judge trying issue order governor state create law lol. mom issue friends want socialize much. ends telling white lies like ""I'm bit weather today"" get stuff, since honest invites judgement. I’m confused, keep posting ‘highest ever’ numbers, best testing we’ve ever had, would make sense cases ever, wouldn’t it? Rounding corner mean much stuck roundabout. absolutely bring own. state new pens everyone voting. either threw away took hole you. one sharing cant lockdown there's stimulus, sure ban holiday gathering, ban flying (even though thats done yet...crazy), lockdown? want people survive? Meth mostly bad areas cities around NYC, places find cheapest bags dope ($4-$5 fold) such. really suburbs. can't say rest Northeast though.

They call molly act like mdma, actually meth. thing meth stigma even dealers addicts want admit meth. even call meth mites ""molly bites"". hit meth ~$5 lasts while. opiate addicts transitioning otherwise takes multiple bags dope get high enough. $5 vs $20 big difference them, destroys much faster.

I got back volunteering homeless people hour ago. meth taking pretty. want die People asking nothing? Easy, election season GOP gives fuck citizens nation. 

They gambled pretending going get Trump reelected, gamble may pay winter exponential spread beginning. starting ramp I'm afraid late make last minute impact voters national level... lot Trumpgret 2016, wait till 2021... 

Please VOTE! Omg Honestly, time around death rates rising rising number cases. wear mask everywhere live Canada actually government loses money manage sick people, I'm lucky way. again, look daily deaths US (or elsewhere). correlating case number way spring. Probably we're getting lower doses? Unsure. think 32-bit capabilities?!? 8-bit kinda guy Irrelevant. country uncontrolled commmunity spread able keep vulnerable populations. Sweden officially nothing entire point. point World Health Organization officially advised lockdowns. US response varied DRAMATICALLY state state, city city. Many US cities power capita rates much lower Europe, many not. saying US result comes federal response vast oversimplification issue, cities states entirely capable handling issue respective ways, exactly happened, also exactly country SUPPOSED work. fact country evaluated single monolith makes sense. depends testing capacity country. you’re able test massive proportion population like US countries doing, it’s useful metric. can’t test 100% people country. get, say, 10% them, get representative sample extrapolate figure many people country actually infected. Especially asymptomatic cases wouldn’t thought seek care therefore test. It'll literally tomorrow. hear China police even wait take jail, kneel neck die suffocation. victims even taped screaming ""I can't breathe"" murdered brutal Chinese police. Truly sickening something hope never see West. Turning corner straight away really hit gas ""I sure Trump gonna totally fix that"" - Ice Cube new pens everyone state. done either threw away took home. McCarthy tried warn you.. Haha ok. vast majority west. Sorry aussies kiwis OPINION : think reflects tribal/sports focused education system US citizens flooded with. Also political division grounded many citizens' poor mathematical reasoning, reading comprehension skills basic scientific learning, immune system works. reason deaths never really get 1200 so? Santa stuffin bodybags instead stockings year. I'm okay this! liked better parking lot coffee shop empty streets empty. Lockdown great! walked every day lost 7 pounds. Cleaned yard. Bought 3d printer, got tech.

I wish could 100 year pandemic, every year!! ^(/s) dad one thanks one Fuckface's superspreader events hometown, definitely part someone ten brain cells. say I'm seething understating it.

Wear fucking masks. somebody draw political lines we’re fucked.

The problem sides drew political lines people still blame other. Plenty ""this Trumps' fault"" going thread even. 

The Democrats like point blame Trump point country found actual plan works, short smallish population remote. Europe got better huge problems delay inevitable.

Democrats Republicans need stop making political figure good plan. happen, many people bought ""my side believes real science"" mess. said could get worse people follow simple guidelines. gave date before? dog named Wally. He's good boy. numbers anywhere America, Americans would agitating firebomb plague rats stop spreading countried civilised health care. you...do think eat vitamins? managed stopped listening Murdoch media. Every step difficult task trying achieve lockdown, newspapers, Internet television stations absolutely blasting leaders.

If media way, would well way joining USA covid hell.

I hope Americans never come understand much malignant media empire harmed nation, demand compensation Australia. Fox News killed people every foreign aggressor combined. 7 day rolling average 3 day rolling average increasing. 836/day currently expected go 1700/day two weeks. downward trend, downward trend while. absolutely mistaken. turning corner, getting better, improving way. can't get right. U.S.A! U.S.A! blame whoever want blame. Trump. cdc. China. Bill gates. Doesn’t matters. 

Nothing change unless decide something different doing. Less 100 people decided shit serious 8 months ago, living reality people forged. 

Take control. Live life. change wish see. Wake up. Rise. Think. Act.

Perception reality, perceive reality shape will. takes longer two weeks. 

Source: Melbournian lockdown six months, hard lockdown four. kind never-Trumper? Sad! Leave covid alone! 😢 Please list countries self reporting results. I'm sure reviewed international commission right? come on, lot people want restrictions. least 40% country; place, probably majority people. meant say ""we've turned coroner"", common misunderstanding.

Not good used still something Maybe Canada build wall keep refugees USA out. Ya EnTIRE WorLD it.... Seems bad Damn wish I’d thought Venturing bridge live under, eh? good safe also wouldn’t accept findings reported website. However, understand scientific process that, process. It’s experts untrustworthy, it’s learning new disease word isn’t gospel. I'm pretty upset cases Minnesota. well seems like people giving up. can't imagine get better gatherings move indoors. Well idea work vaccine starts roll out. Also think way. deaths getting awfully close 1% mortality rate confirmed cases. 

It’s insanity people believing hasn’t hurt specifically yet. Takeout everyday absolutely fine, even considering pandemic. Get lazy ass cook, order bottles Soylent least healthier waste much $$. Maybe could IRS audit covid. see till audit done. thought. Whats solution? Voting solving all. I'm dual citizen (US Canada) riding pandemic Canada looking go Florida really soon. I've closely monitoring see US point, ship controlling sailed. 

In Canada lockdowns, also $2,000 per month given anyone work pandemic. US social support, can't lockdown.

Think protests looting going on, really think that's social issues? literally result pandemic.

The factor compliance, Canadians actually listened obeyed rules, much less US. matter next president is, half country listen. 

What possibly done point? Regardless vote, new administration start January, even policy changes take time show results. would policy changes even be? mask mandate federal buildings, people go federal buildings daily basis? 

Please enlighten voting going help us Covid. idea worst fall/winter every bit hypothetical idea immunity long-lived.  link actual stats last 8 months. show deaths ""trended down"" all. right. soon discussion turned 'staying safe socially responsible thing' 'STOP INFRINGING RIGHTS WEAR MASK', government official intended flatten curve began fighting different fight, lost influence people easily swayed Trump Co's political play diminish threat virus. 

It's incredible looking country much USA changed past 4 years. really, really hope go vote, sake good people deserve safe sane country live in. Good, municipality they're one fire Sherriff. agree poverty life long situation. already stated awful confounding factors like education racism play.

Covid didnt cause poverty though. Much sucks, financial well isnt important people dying, though think government supporting people situation.

 understand anything poverty. another sheltered Redditor.

I lived poverty number years, whilst definitely well now, know like. said, dont need experience something understand terrible even didnt. really spacing, masks, sanitation almost eliminate it. Otherwise China would horrible shape. hypothetical though minority (but sizeable, takes like 5-10% ruin everyone, least 30-40%) Americans stupid that. I'm talking literal mouth breathers think Trump second coming. Wait, President can’t order lockdown national emergency? congress even that? Gone Easter That's 10% America's population Yes, would work, quarantine center. would remove circulating population. Unless need intensive care. 

Or, allow people board recovered. immune, excepy fo pesky reinfection cases. long 100% infection? Also full lead  it’s arguably worse now... great tired winning ? dont want brain surgeon practicing medicine anyway. idea South East Asians think. Nope. Yup. definitely yup. remember first real warning sign watching videos Chinese nurses complete mental breakdowns. screaming crying government lying dealing with, truly horrible watch. knew would get lot worse there. Right-wing Americans basically think wisdom stupid.

They anti-education. considered ""Cool"" dumb. can't even wrap head around it. winter yet. would get you, no, get US regards covid? Yes. Singapore also went full lockdown contained virus. laws enforce fining ppl going 5 mph speed limit, cops r absolute scums society, don’t realize r public servants Sardines riddled lead Dude, since May pass another relief package American people. We're literally forced go back work families starve. 

I sympathize guy. guarantee nobody wanted higher (a single person) demanded everybody back site, happened literally every office worker know (when fine remotely). Shit's fucked man, going wrong person. happening everywhere. 

Oh, chuckle fuck something. Errbody getting something... 'cause comes Covid Clause. basically have. venture places know essentially deserted. I've seen movies person theater (or couple people spread waaaaay out), comic book shop (early, one ever there), late night grocery shopping 24 hour place. Reddit certainly makes seem like competition bottom US spikes number coronavirus cases... 

I’m trying give little perspective parts world worse. Idk guys, sounds like we're winning me! Quit helicoptering Turning coroner millionaire, amirite? do, litigate sometimes worth Hi Queen Creek x Gilbert Rd!!! 3 year old bummed--Halloween absolute favorite thing. drew pumpkin faces Easter eggs, we're flashlight search backyard tomorrow night. already are. Obviously isn’t strong suit, point repeated nauseam need wrap brain around one.

Things look worse, healthcare wise economically let get control. Both! one. thing whining about, yeah, still fucking happen.

The best outcome quick severe lockdown, byproduct leave faster recovery helps people you’re worried about.

If actually worried people, duty situation full shit repeat stubborn bullshit instead facing problem. Seriously, shit basic

You’re illuminating fact people going suffer financial.y smh... PREVIOUS DATA compare !!!! crazy see many people age going halloween parties snapchat. None wearing masks. They're singing songs top lungs they're dancing together small crowded room. US drunk belligerent guy party *should* pump brakes go home... mysteriously, handle vodka appears kitchen counter note: ""From Russia, Love."" hell breaks loose. Beds what's lacking, ventilators medical aid. It’s dangerous flu, dumbass. Try thinking brain instead regurgitating everything shitty news sources tell you. Reply back “thurs, nov 25, 2021” state record highest number new cases one day seeing positivity rates 30%, still ramping testing all. Nice skipped good statistic.

**36%+ positivity rate** ""It is""

- guy many think deserves second term. Yeah stupid fake Taiwan numbers lmao get closer election, it'll go up. Trump one example leadership many western counties messed up. Trump seemed encourage COVID-19 spread [Tulsa [White outbreaks allowed spread [naval CDC literally estimated 10 times many cases country 'official' count, fair also included march/april surge. 

The thing is, people always need get tested. Even unlimited testing, going miss huge percentage asymptomatic patients, also people need get tested. outbreak family took one person getting tested know everybody Covid. thing friends apartment roommates, 5 people one person got tested. makes happy see country come together implement procedures stop spread. Meanwhile, many things changed America, live low impact area. make work somehow ;) Worse, fear future lame duck president active obstructing efforts get control. Oh gosh, also ADHD plus autism, executive functioning *sucks!* 

I either COVID worst extended anxiety attack life back March/April, I've pleasantly surprised brain fog memory issues I've months interfered getting decent grades school. Studying remotely's HUGE lifesaver me, though. tested positive That’s one new case every fucking second. RIP America That's even better. Anything 10% means people testing lot great Right every reinfection sensationalized media though. common. Oh fuck off. I'm sorry people try pressure children, literally nothing that. 

Don't kids, happy it. use grief stranger try make weird point it. Omg guys beating expectations every day Family gatherings big reason cases rise many places. See link Fauci talking below.

 **Fauci says small gatherings driving new Covid outbreaks, worries Thanksgiving**

**""We're going precarious situation.""** leave rocket scientists. leave rocket scientists. Jeff Bezos? Jesus christ universities schools nation want act like nothing going on. mention athletic organizations. Damn shame. one wants step put things pause he’ll even lockdown stagnate virus anymore blamed anyone. However, Sturgis motorcycle rally may superspreader event killed folks other. Please example United States. Show us true leadership compassion human lives looks like. Show us locking spares tens tens thousands lives. Show us government puts people alternate agendas power-hungry narcissists looks like.

At least watch country right thing sit within absolute failure nation leadership, empathy, desire follow science.

Show us leadership looks like.

We’re overtaken wave within next month. 😢

If rest world wants see true exponential growth looks like, massive control grow scientists books talk about, you’re see US Nov, Dec, Jan US. Game. Set. Match. winning? Sorry, explain authoritarianism is? taking measures wearing masks, staying indoors, ordering takeaways waiting dangers pandemic pass? ""this infringement rights die endanger others haircut weeks""? sorry. lost grandparents (both around - 90s). lot internal issues prior covid, like language barrier always wanted address, always go unanswered. abuela went first abuelo, front eyes.

I share want talk absolute stranger experienced side. Anything need, love.   China’s approach keep Covid-19 bay helped restore confidence. strategy steeped authoritarianism.

Why canard still keep get trotted US press? Plenty non-authoritarian countries achieved similar success suppressing virus. Word hold # winter coming

never thought line would much meaning power 2020 Remember world watched China locked entire province? 80k cases. Total. makes crave bowl cinnamon sweet Apple Jacks. #1 - needs pinned, important know.

Because virus smart active work hours. Truly reddit moment folks unironically giving wholesome award. !remindme 4 weeks We're #1! We're #1! We're #1! Covid Fatigue Syndrome (people getting restless) combined cooler weather less social distancing. would nice President could explain something instead talking shit time. ok random person knowing anything, leader country. mean... things already happening?

He can't start he's already *been* doing. Wtf talking tanks.  Texas history real class take child texas? 2003-2004 SARS1 scared shit them, took zero time hesitate word came new similar virus appeared China. It’s already happening. Arizona shortages shelves. President can't actually nuke area singlehandedly. department can, thank goodness.

Is military warped corrupt would nuke nation? President would merely telling launch it. still it.

If instantly, China would've reduced dust 1970s Nixon almost nightly begging everyone drunken rants nuke China. Like honestly we're little people getting bored acting like exist, weird. Idk, guess I’ll take data actual experts random redditor doesn’t want accept data. BBC ashamed Boris Johnson, Brits typically mention PMs name? rude rude anyone going bring horribly Walmart dealing pandemic this? Shortening store hours forcing people store shorter period time, making everyone enter one entrance, forcing people closer together. roundabout going circles. millions corners rounded. biggest, best corners i've ever seen. know death side right?

Also good goods. Fix next time. That's lot comparatively that. locked whole bloody country down. streets empty across China. think didn’t know Pritzker billionaire. alone makes assume we’re even footing.

 idea crew private jet looks like kind protocols maintain. real reason saying this, repeating lines, you’re everything expected be, devoid point view individual point.

You heard mentioned you’re clinging it, ignoring bit hypocrisy going forward full steam. think holding position fiercely makes true, doesn’t work. know deep bitching this, probably 1000 important COVID topics discuss, pretty nonsensical, you’re invested shy away now.

Also, btw, despise him, don’t let kind thing affect objective ability measure whether someone taking appropriate steps mitigate pandemic. So, you’re gonna find something partisan.

Seriously, dumb people repeat 5e things smarter people say without sense awareness de facto admitting can’t improve it.

Pathetic. Yeah, either COVID worst fucking anxiety attack life followed shitty ear infection back March/April, brain fog got less less frequent pretty much gone August/September. still feel like struggle auditory-process remember things compared time last year, though. would test literally millions kids scheme lmao able, see call talk nurses staff there, may willing get set video chat you!

As time goes prove virus deadly smoking, heart disease unhealthy eating habbits.
The toolbars brains chant president un office many deaths, yet, turn blind eye u healthy American population actually many people die due plenty causes absolutely jackshit about. Winter Coming I'm sure there's good news here, can't help wonder underhanded scheme get kids back school parents go back feeding economy, regardless actually works. Yea going fucking vertical here. Honestly, believe lot 50%. majority right certainly fall category, also think significant percent left well. People generally though effort fact check themselves. they're right, accident. People believe what's convenient, politically otherwise.  Well real nations provide aid rent mortgage help. 

The US real nation. Yeah everyone Sweden hint old age comorbities dead. country supermen left! Give month. Deaths lag behind cases several weeks. seems disability struck wisdom July 24th, 514 cases Victoria's 532.

Their actions followed since lead different outcomes. Victoria: 0, France: 49,215 (worldometers). 933 new deaths...933. Fuck. people losing minds right many people is. Wtf this. hell, insanity. feel like everyone FKING DESENSITIZED?!?!? mistake brain dead Americans book cabins anyway  Right right, I’m aware that. meant like, could someone use bigass nuke trigger really really bigass boom like Yellowstone? know you’re going through. 

I’m sorry falls apart consider people actually capacity think make choices. Yep. feel like I've forgotten stuff easily years ago, sucks honest. I'm 23.

Of course Chinese people wore masks followed health guidelines authoritarian government.

Very people \[Western country\] wear masks follow health guidelines they're free.

Please ignore \[Western country\]'s authoritarian government spent months lying populace telling wearing masks dangerous health, herd immunity solution, virus Chinese hoax hurt economy.  Republicans misunderstanding meaning Freedom WINNING number statistically meaningless. probably look all-cause mortality 2020 compare previous years. Maybe look number deaths Covid19 alone without comorbidities. Perhaps stratify available data age risk factors? Idk, thought.... even article, youtube video unknown channel brother tested positive days ago, got co-worker.

Curiously, wife, 2 daughters mom close contact tested negative. 

I wish luck. Mathematically speaking point, isn’t inevitable get Us? even try? Genuine Q form non American. set online meeting?

Please wear mask around people. didn’t factor people charge would stop trying altogether...  We’re rounding corner day now...  Bag skittles 99 skittles one cyanide capsule shaped like skittle safe Halloween trick treating. Fuck scare tactics. people optimistic, far direction. 2 weeks, going like 1400 daily deaths (7 day averages including weekends... weekends we'll see 900, weekdays might touch 2k). CDC found like 350k excess deaths year? dry towels wood racks bedroom put shallow bowls water. Seems help. know towels get bone dry. wholesome sick bastards? downvoted wtf past 4 years taught people know what's good nothing will. success democracy relies well-informed electorate. instead tens millions highly indoctrinated hysterical lunatics. Wut USA USA USA take late october schools cause spike? legitimately seems like came nowhere. mean, definitely eventually decrease even nothing done. way people going die. sensationalism media headlines, that's sure!



I recommend BNO reinfection tracker.



My operating assumption 400 ""suspected"" reinfections confirmed, made pile probables good reason.



We must recognize currently VASTLY underreported, many reasons critical thinker realize soaking matter minute two. Next week fucking late. meanwhile positive patients like...i gonna go pick something Kroger really quick, it, drop Moes say hi lenny (which one lenny?) worries. hospitalize people get sick. Cut oxygen give morphine, like people care homes strains ICU beds. Lowest number confirmed cases, dare say higher early outbreaks lack tests stopped confirmed.  Adjusted per capita, isnt even close *daily average* France experiencing.

But US plastered front page sub reason... one HIV deniers claim HIV deadly people die directly (only diseases immune system suddenly can't handle anymore?) always thought phrease"" spread like plague"" figure speech. think Americans would turn fact. steadily increasing since start 

The recent increase starts September 12th 6 weeks ago. ""lag time"" 

People 18 29 getting mostly now. Largest age bracket large margin getting it. die nominally conspiracy theory actually makes sense government agents reptiles. *Orders 4 months supplies* seriously haven’t left place either long. I’m beginning wonder I’m crazy one... since actual cases consistently 10x cases tested (as shown antibody testing), actually like million cases day. Hey, least we'll herd immunity months. Yes we're turning corner right onto road total annihilation . words, water wet. got mine 2 weeks ago pharmacy, waiting get stuck, guy walked asked drive thru testing said “I know I’m supposed come inside wasn’t sure do..”. fucking phone right? Fuck me. Taiwan, South Korea, Hong Kong, New Zealand? It’s obviously possible get putbrrak control. China’s fedgree os societal control makes much easier west. Heard immunity term used medicine refer vaccination, voluntary contraction virus. It’ll take 80% **vaccination** reach herd immunity. also possible virus twice. 80% people get virus, we’re looking 3 million dead. Stop pushing nonsense. mind it’s raw data, still accurate tools used gather relativity individuals reporting it. wouldn’t say that’s means virus safer thought. better understanding treat COVID patients provide higher level specialized care hospitalized patients. Also, risk populations either passed away due COVID following better quarantine precautions protect getting COVID. It'll 200k cases 1600 deaths per day Thanksgiving. France recorded 49k yesterday 47k day before. Adjusted population, equals 248k 238k cases US. ""Delerium"" symptom, probably experience greater severity ""brain fog"", legit. Covid Symptoms lasted month, similar yours, delerium lasted 2-3 weeks. heavy-peaked 2 weeks.

I vouch it; trust anxiety. verge dying (seriously) tropical virus 3rd world country; never reached close mindset (via covid) hospitalization. vouch chest pain trouble breathing covid; I'm younger 30. me, seriously believe anxiety &amp; fear would enduce psychosis anxiety attack requiring emergency care average individual; extremities felt like ready give clot.

The DELERIUM FUCKED, pity state-of-mind like naturally. absolutely bananas shit, aware reality operate devices confusion. get state, gonna need Ironclad mental Fortitude, Self-acceptance, &amp; altruism. Otherwise, might wind seriously hurting some. 

Sounds lice mental illness, huh? well taste viens literally effects brain hormones, directly translates cognition, behavior, &amp; feel.

I'm good though, cocktail physical &amp; psychological fatigue (for suspectiple) something able prepare for. slow burn. Get plenty food, rest water. vaccine might meant give people false confidence schools reopen fully. can't tell seen emphasis economy health country's response. tell believe J J removed administration country. 

Sure might conspiracy theory, given abhorrent response pandemic thus far definitely realm possibility they're giving us placebo placate masters industry.  100,000. blinked! say permanently, mean Biden wins can't change positions? gonna die! 

Wait. masks, hand sans, social distance. 

I downplaying this. wish us would basics. parent comments thread talking late 2021 possibly vaccine out

Also think sentiment pretty normal even isn’t vaccine late 2021. young people aren’t wasting years prime life. won’t happen I'd love see correlation political gatherings/events number.  

Reminder, reality cannot election interference. guys!!! Always #1 🏆🍾🙄 beginning feel like might turning corner. Mostly see recently Europe massive spike numbers. Europe initial outbreaks, much higher rate deaths cases. Europe restrictions managed slow rate deaths new cases while, time US despite much smaller population managed catch surpassed Europe deaths cases thus focus drawn happening there. recent times there’s new surge cases Europe US, see regions mentioned time. However US recorded ~235k deaths compared Europe ~263k deaths, remember US vastly smaller population Europe. places done terrible job point time US done worse. Little know actually Easter 2021 sure, 60%+ pretty significant. 

Except median age 61.7 years. age, almost 1/10 Alzheimers already, many would probably show forms brain damage brains crazy people's minds look data still try dismiss it.

Did interpret critical thinking mean dismissing study? Yet Taiwan reports exact absence cases. Fib want China faking numbers, clearly outbreak tight control since late March. Masks, collectivistic culture respect elderly. ya go. Democrats always get blame

Only Republicans. Sadly, people willing ignore mistakes party. Trump Obama terms illustrated Ok I’m seriousness, COVID pandemic really serious blown proportion? 

And yes, believe science, medicine, higher education that. don’t believe hoax conspiracy. feel like MSNBC news really dramatic focuses random number cases without much context. sound completely awful it’s like millions people dying. 

Ok. Shit. Don’t destroy here. I’m genuinely curious think. remember, we're ""turning corner,"" apparently.

Did anyone mention Left Right? thought Europeans travel? Would portable HEPA filters effective? mean trust MIT source?

My source contains diverse collection published peer-reviewed studies meta-analysis. source opinion piece written blog editor. really we've come to? Fake virus, fake numbers. won’t matter negative test capturing moment time. could taken test, gone store caught then. Doesn’t matter state blue red. Many studies there. Google. know nurse twice. friend friend well. Looking roughly 90 days (some cases more, less) antibodies gone. Google it. It’s everywhere.

Here immunity horrible myth since day 1. It’s real. Doesn’t exist. Fake hope. That’s like saying there’s herd immunity common cold.

This new reality. People need accept need entirely new government gets like many countries control swift strict measures.

This avoidable US. choices made, purpose, backfired, fucked know it. Belgium (30 times less population), weekly avarage (October 21 27):
- 15847 new cases/day
- 547/day admitted hospital
- 90 death per day

So, worse every way, corrected population.

Just Friday evening, new lockdown announced. School vacation lengthened 2 weeks (""with great sadness"" Flanders minister Education), non medical contact professions ((hair dresser, ...) closed, non essential shops closed, ... refers though nature person/place/thing. That's necktie ideal example. Everything else previous replier said point though. Meanwhile go store Washington browse hundreds strains available sale. I've seen unbelievable amount dumb fucks internet even reddit use idea say vaccine never work definitely count [""excess racist jokes write It’s neither. Look up.  According CDC we've 300k since beginning october: 16 provinces better yet free speech, free access information, political freedom. thanks. Taiwan #1 This. brought every fucking day Melbourne Australia's 6 month lockdown. Freedums wanted let virus rip.

We another 0 case day, thankful real leader make incredibly unpopular decisions greater good. probably destroyed political career - easy right wing controlled media manipulate everything next election ROUNDING TURN BOYS ROUNDING TURN!

 \* COUGH COUGH GASP WHEEZE\* 


ROUNDING TURN! Count figure. got result back 😣 I'm starting think whole Coronavirus thing mistake. way  Winning? Also, Phuc Trump! agree, hospitalization probably best indicator things going. Even deaths kind muddled statistic USA #1! lockdowns. wanna infect everyone, see happens. Maybe mutate get covid america strain. This. Plus everyone two bathrooms spare room. I've think happens partner gets open plan flat except bedroom bathroom. sick person isolate bedroom bathroom going ossue.

Thankfully keep home humid hate dry air lots tropical plants. Even leaving saucers water next radiators helps bring little. sure air home regularly tooa  Last week would better ok. want conspiratorial, want something change, change something. Assholes care economy feign wait-and-see attitude hell breaks loose act they're taking radical measures recommended scientists also obvious anyone moron. Take easy gloomer! Joking, hopefully study changes study 200,000 patients Los Angeles tested positive antibodies. less 800 died. april, treatment/therapy gotten better since then. think 25k overestimate. Source? 🤔 took jobs Man. Back LAST winter heard new virus. 

Me now. quit. quit everything. using 24-bit signed integer hoping stack overflow around nine million mark. manage get cases zero, somehow got cases -8388608. Data says also italy. political battle behind lot easier blame bars close them. becomes debate education vs drinks, regardless factual data. yahoo.com may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Thank helping us keep information /r/Coronavirus reliable!


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* love dump administration whatever opportunity though? report question see mentions ""ending"" pandemic Wait.  

We’re getting flu season. cases exploding.  Peak flu season December March.   

We could easily see 400,000 cases per week.  Covid easier spread locations don’t mask rules, things could easily get hand.  

During Italy’s crisis Case Fatality Rate (CFR) almost 10%.  

If 35 60 Million get COVID, 3.5 6. million people dead March unrealistic.  

Public health officials don’t want scare populace, Homeland Security prepares for. even one pass senate, could easily imagine lame duck wanting sign law purely spite downvoted they're saying incorrect. ""extreme protective measures"", april/may lockdown ended 4 may. 

International national travel allowed, businesses reopened, school reopened, bars reopened, etc. again?? really US? probables probably positive rapid antigen tests.. like half states count towards total case count Cuomo killed 7000 elderly citizens nursing homes. heard reliable source you’re ‘turning corner’? impression union would protect management(i.e. police chief)? Stupid, selfish people dooming world, hoping zombie apocalypse. get that. think good majority people would act way whether Trump office not. Reminder: infection-hospitalization-death curve began start school year currently \~Week 10. Typically, infections start showing around 4 weeks, knock infections rising hospitalizations Week 4-Week 8. means essentially seeing infections first \~5 weeks school year associated infections far. Even locked today nationwide we'd still burn 5 weeks rising infections, hospitalizations deaths curved down.

We see major uptick Halloween Thanksgiving soonest. Thanksgiving infections showing around Christmas. Christmas/NYE infections showing end January-Early February.

This we're beginning steep part. number 1!!  one cares Australia reopened, expect surge cases actually warned Biden elected he'll listen scientists doctors, instead making whatever one likes sound making false promises Trump clearly doing. O_o USA! USA! USA! Slovenia closed schools since mid October now. Universities closed since beginning (1. oct). international flight thing dilemma foreigners wouldn’t able get back China would accused human right violation. can't think many ran would willfully lie severity pandemic threat, right start continue face mountains evidence.

Politics certainly impacted nation's response pandemic. like Australia's leaders saints... Nope, one account here. I'm really confused now! comment got deleted too. Perhaps replying wrong people, so, apologies! Reddit mess moment bots deleting comments shop know think good style resort ad hominem, quite frankly find incredibly immature invites hostility, that's bots do. spade spade. 

You're basing entire opinion cloth-face-diapers blog one flawed study wrong assumption COVID-19 spread air droplets. terrifying thriller SONGBIRD, COVID-23 virus mutated world is
in fourth year lockdown. Infected Americans ripped homes and
forced quarantine camps known Q-Zones, escape, as
a brave souls fight back forces oppression. Amid dystopian
landscape, fearless courier, Nico (KJ Apa), who’s immune deadly pathogen,
finds hope love Sara (Sofia Carson), though lockdown prohibits them
from physical contact.

Oh fuck premise, playing public’s distrust. ""What looking for?""

""Sex, dad."" Fake news, President said California hit 100k Remember 5k day back march whole world watched horror went extreme lockdown? *America! Fuck yeah!!* You’re matrix buddy. Try using critical thinking. Thanks! surprised see mountains ""from almost everywhere France""

That's case I'm anticipating lot depressing ""whole family gets COVID-19, grandma dies"" type stories Thanksgiving first week 2021. 😩 Interesting flu rate 98% though. reckoning. people recklessly endanger Americans actions must prosecuted fullest extent law. jsut change username wrong account? That's felt like Colorado too. started well, weeks ""Things getting bad, please social distance wear mask"" statements nothing else cases skyrocket Yes, week ending 17 October least deaths since March. Isn’t what’s supposed matter? sometimes wonder country many anti-this that’s WWII now, would even war. explain uncle, **adamant** could catch time. said read like apartment, one virus vacancy cells would leave alone. There's terrible misinformation floating around. several mask mandates countries massive surges. clearly hugely effective, probably reduce small percentage infections. Spain France two them. I'm comparing US country though? I'm asking specifically people think US lockdown possible. Quit comparing, isnt race. I'm USA wanted know people would accept lockdown even possible due scale spread country.  Flush turd November 3rd. preferably beforehand, kind turd might take 15 20 flushes. followed beginning abhorred insistence keeping international flights going whilst sealing provinces. 

They assholes start. Sweden lot less restrictions countries though.
We never curfews restrictions meeting people. I'm still dealing people insist putting ""pandemic"" quotes every time write it, misnomer even exist. Wuhan city Hubei province strict lockdown.

The rest China strict. took train ride Northeast China back Beijing time. Work home Beijing weeks. city subways still running, super markets open, still people wandering outside buying food walking dogs everyone wearing mask. 

The thing whole society would collaborate stay home best keep control. Why? would say that?

Seems super weird comment. Cmon Pfizer. You’re literally hope. Even shutting country save us now.  would think Republicans would proud small local government getting things done instead things done state federal level... ""Those rookie numbers racket.""  fair, people ignore speed limits time well. area cars routinely 65+ 40 zone 90+ 65. Always selfish people think minor inconvenience important people's lives, small piece fabric arriving destination 2 minutes slower. Lol literally Karen situation Exactly, pace lockdown China. Everywhere else combination restrictions recommendations. Sweden wasn’t special story. add atleast 4 digits numbers. Huge Sorry autocorrect messed up. Yes, asking people set online voting facilties Sorry hear guys. Hope things get better Google unreliable. Thanks, check out. could USA let happen? zero cases middle winter (June). outbreak came escaping hotel quarantine, literally combated winter following scientific modeling health advice.

We take easy path, countless countries including many Europe continue so. can't half ass expect result outbreak continue.

We lockdown 100 days incredibly strict restrictions get control. second theory well - antibody transmission. Though think makes drastic difference (we're still 1k daily deaths). IOW initial cases novel virus human bodies know effectively clear.

But now, there's likely 10-20% infected/recovered there's probably transmission antibodies mucosal droplets. one reasons human endemic viruses tend less severe. know, go la la la hear confirm beliefs ignore everything else. meant. funnily he's orange wears mask, two three time year. photos. [We need nearly 850 million needles syringes vaccinate US would take roughly 24 months produce many needles Well, it’s settled, then. gotten flu shot 6 years. Really trying stay away everyone.  Store sizes much different. anything like Holland grocery store across hotel maybe little bigger 711's. Yeah, high R0 value (the average amount people someone virus pass to) could see happening. course, R0 value dynamic hospitals overflowing people knowing folks died would naturally reduce R0 value. lieu social distancing, remote work mask usage, reduce R0 value. course, exponential growth asymptomatic transmission, anything even *barely sufficient* look like overreaction. They've lying data since around May. China perhaps one worst examples good government response. mean, went 50k 100k two three weeks so... Trump still office (and probably pissy losing) soo... surprised see 300k daily January.  fucking insane people made got raise unemployment. 

The country simply afford lockdowns, period. already blew untold trillions paying people work, enriching businesses scammed PPP grants, trillion prop stock market. Yes, absolutely is. like %50 folklore, opinion, misinformation. Wait start saying beat pandemic Dems let come back. lo, Republicans wipe memories repeat new creed. Remember bad is, would far worse many us weren’t doing. get one day. They're politicians politicians do.

I'm disgusted average person here, knows stakes high yet can't bothered take basic, simple precautions. And, political motive: simply can't bothered. would curious see ""one-day increase"" defined per claim OP (i.e. consecutive calendar days, 7-day diff, e.g. Friday Friday?). think true. see many single (consecutive) day jumps bigger past month, compared jump 10/29 10/30.

The situation absolutely fucking horrible, new case count today clearly highest ever. tired seeing new person claim every single day biggest one-day increase, usually isn't. crisis bad enough, need make things up. *narrator \*starts coughing\**

(2020 surprise..) pretty bogus. IFR peak NYC's first wave [is estimated well hardly outside realm possibility city/state's hospital system could become overburdened NYC April. serious nonpolitical question: sort stats many tests done opposed months ago? feel like must factored many cases appearing, sense become significantly better testing that's we're seeing high numbers? voting? understand risk science gatherings spread covid. care. Cute!!!! It’s definitely neighborhood :( I'm bot? lol clearly see post history way bot buddy, would even botting for, mask wearing?

Pretty disingenuous say simply thst infections began increase states mask mandates, cases increased everywhere states mask mandates hadkwer growth infections per population states without it, especially accounting population density.

Sorry hurt feelings calling obvious biased blog trying downplay aspects covid 19. lol ordered sushi door dash Dallas today. hope don’t get sick either man. work hotel I’m constantly exposed people coming around :(. strict mask people still staff tells pull up. mention people denial protesting gathering restrictions, least happens Spain embarrassing thought governement wanted 1p/25sqm end bring number 1p/10sqm Fighting virus builds immune system response combat specific virus, resources spent building responses one virus second virus starts attacking, resources spread thin immune system work really hard fight viruses time. That's awesome! wish US government cared anything besides suppressing vote maintaining power. Amazing throwing estimate fact I'm tired depressed reading that. 

anyone already watch documentary ""totally control"".  Lol know genuinely fucking masterclass brainwashing Republicans genuinely convinced idiots like believe actively peddle ""both sides same!!!"" nonsense. 

there plenty reliable news sources US quality journalists actually report facts. sadly case current president cult literally live reality care what's actually true. reporting ""partisan"" way matters.

it's actually incredible (alt) right wing psychopaths genuinely convinced large chunks massive country make whatever fuck want pretend true one possibly know. education truly completely failed week Laura Ingraham, person called Fauci alarmist predicting number, got made fun Trump rally wearing mask, less. I'm hoping plans invade sometimes soon liberate us.

I'll mark house passover little red maple leaf workers Kroger grocery store I'm RIGHT wearing masks store opens. I'm high risk due lungs collapsed stapled, employer gaf. Yeah, want spin wheel first shot game Russian Roulette, never mind second. Especially since first prize literal nothing. best, get worse worse ... well, dying horribly dead.

That's expert medical (undergraduate) public health (postgraduate) degree opinion. technical see. Yeah July till October lockdown short two weeks. thank goodness now. Good bot. virus literally killed whole family, conservatives would still call hoax. intelligent people. oh, dramatic Enjoy living rest life moron. tabloid news paper. Absolute trash. told sky blue would go outside double check. forget Black Friday! didnt call delay, ease restrictions, couldnt get tested full capacity, shouldnt treated like someone didnt get tested intentionally.

As 7:00, start testing, required capacity medical personnel 91% filled. teacher I’m exposed least 100 people (students staff) day, half school back session. room tiny way socially distance. 
Many students wear masks incorrectly many go parties weekends. 

I asked HR working home even option, responded saying it’s “case case” asking Covid exposed (when asked meant). we're adjusting probably also adjust roughly oh lets say 30ish% Americans would never get tested unless ended hospital though. hate potus much anyone else FDA dragging feet politicizing it. political parties believe it.
Only 12% antibodies ripped also aware diseases progression. point want bolster immune system fight virus point may dealing immune overreaction virus. 

Trying bolster immune system overreacting could counter productive. Bottom line talk doctor everything considering taking long plan take it, even vitamins. Black Friday going renamed Plague Friday. Sardines help absorption purely cause fat content (vitamin one fat-soluble vitamins) - I'm eating 'real food' come on, deficient something need temporary supplementation there's nothing wrong taking tablet form! worried absorption, take pick literally fatty food (donut, milk, olive oil, peanut butter) feel it. election results go poorly (i.e. US doesnt wake get shit together) ass social media several months least. China Virus 2: Christmas Revenge. accurate looking university Could agree mate. disgrace bias media is. infuriating

Funny liberal state South australia get mention closed borders like Queensland western Australia. Must coincidence

What's worse many people ok it. Congratulations? Arrest them. 

Criminals. ... science right again. Saddest part? federal government stand November 3rd. Trump Promised C19 would April. supposed hoax. keep pretending hoax November 3rd. shocked us too. Science works.

I know right? would thought Scientist knew shit? Yeah, Americans suck learning example this. got watch Italy rest Europe seemed learn nothing. states got watch happened northeast seemed learn nothing. happened Louisiana’s data? looks like stopped reporting testing or...I’m little confused? Waited France Germany finger point cringey thing small amount Redditors say. great sacrifice holiday.

You mean government using absolute authority actually enforce immediate, unconditional, unobjectionable lockdown. I'm sad say that's one drawbacks Americas freedom, freedumbs. Well, edge get shut again. Beat that, countries! 🇺🇸 leet Literally soon need America anymore, I'm fucking ASAP.   doctor recommended get flu shot leaving hospital, meant going die. Though you’re wrong. I'm disappointed American time. Yeah gets interesting now. Buckle buttercup. Wear medal honour dont know man. People still think sandy hook holocaust hoax Y'all gonna vaccinated old-fashioned way. Y'know, Middle Ages. think fucking funniest thing democrats website don’t even realize America’s fatality percentage pretty fucking low compared developed countries. like screwing around. it, right, wait sure right, maintain stupid stuff reinfecting. I'm southern Austria. completely control. people incl. politicians still stupid something all. That‘s people holding religious books guns say books.  
The problem book - bible “mean“ anything likely didn‘t even read it. 

The problem people feel religious book, gun flag belong picture.  
Those people same, story always same. France cases increasing heavily quite long, examples taken roughly month go good situation lockdown-level (e.g. Switzerland, Czechia). Seeing kind increase starting happen Norway, Denmark Sweden concerning, since Nordic countries quite similar restrictions testing level. Finland situation looked good week, Yesterday reported highest daily number cases (bit 300).   Wouldn’t need absolutely retarded try resume normal scheduled life without kid receiving vaccine first? Investing bidet recently suddenly feels like one best decisions year manipulation recently leading suspicious steep drop cases,

Cases increasing India: Data correct

Cases decreasing India: DATA MANIPULATION. dare poor third world country better USA!

Please get lost. India still million tests per day data manipulation arguments makes sense. know getting downvotes. multiple studies showing vitamin D, vitamin C, zinc, magnesium improve clinical outcomes. Ive seen news headline, word word, like 3 times now, different numbers. heard kind virus. sure tho. could panic. county judge margo Yeah but... 98% decrease something virulent omnipresent flu?

Also, still use “social distancing good hygiene” argument intended purpose stopping COVID-19, didn’t.  must removed everyone shit saying Ok, where's proof indication this?

Where reports crowded hospitals? body spike funeral homes? social media examples people fallen ill?

Despite authoritarian government, impossible get information China. pandemic spike Feb March, tons evidence got likely underreporting cases. 

But since huge spike, much evidence systematic underreporting/non reporting. They've gone back business usual massively tested spike (Qingdao earlier month) cases. 

China still awful authoritian state respect human rights roundly deserves criticism initial handling COVID critical early stages December January. even broken clocks right twice day. heavy handed COVID handling initial stages saved hundreds thousands lives. Scroll ""Comorbidities"" Table 3 CDC's words: ""For 6% deaths, COVID-19 cause mentioned.""

Source: There's sub that's pretty big that's pro china thought circle jerk sub. pretty crazy. America hate pretty obvious main sub Could something early surge demand flu shots combined social distancing good hygiene. Dr Fauci right predicting 100k infection day back months ago. think others

This American way. national motto ""fuck you, got mine"". you’ve developed egg allergy think still get nasal spray version ICU care. Freedom cruises folks recognize getting 14 days work opportunity travel. exchange waiving access hospital care, spend time others letting virus control lives. masks, social distancing, living while. passengers fine...and rest us fine people loafing local bars restaurants can't spend much time isolation.

Counter systemic everyday racism, help people consume less better food, respect support elderly, make education affordable, offer conservatives safe exit mass psychosis. It’s also first day Premier Daniel Andrews fronted daily press q&amp;a (he sent Health Minister). 

Regardless political beliefs, you’ve got admire politician works 120 days straight, delivering briefing &amp; proving answers press gallery runs questions. hope Mr Andrews well-deserved day off! Yea, exactly this. 

Me gf live together. symptoms back April, got tested. Since positive, need get tested well. Even found out, basically knew it. hope naive. needed, more. Much more. Far many people stupid, selfish irresponsible right thing. told. neighbors eventually police must. Dude bought propaganda hook, line sinker.. lol Covid kills people every year, come people Gronk.

The thing people really Bad estimating effect life expectancy.

The spreadsheet _also_ estimate personal long term expected loss disability adjusted life years due pandemic. Give time. article another one phrase ""...more previously thought."" That's pattern. Anytime headline says ""no reason alarmed"" basically dismiss it. Eh. France, Britain, Victoria Aus, definitely lockdowns.  There’s infection can’t test it! Simple that! Sending love strength🤍 Cope harder. nice hear. Thank you. bit annoying reading Murdoch newspapers telling us throw borders open, taken Swedish model instead.

Heck day curfew lifted, murdoch journalist complained lockdown taking longer, announcement complained lockdown lifting quick business time open properly.

IHME accurate still undercounted country recent days - despite already predicting quite scary numbers. Wow! tell story Xinjiang re-education camps! can't wait. average American even hear pandemic numbers lately. conference call work Americans shocked told France 40000 new cases. told USA numbers floored. could see faces idea. don’t know Aaron Collins all. know informative (and unbiased) mask testing videos YouTube, contributions /r/Masks4All sub. 

Your “bigger question” nothing straw man argument. Aaron (and sane people /r/Masks4All ) dissuading people buying readily available sources. dissuading people buying sources adequately proven selling products consistent quality claimed efficacy. don’t kind particulate testing gear someone like /u/coll0412 (and knowledge use gear interpret measurements), trusting word person you’re buying you’re getting safe product. 

Many KF94/KN95 masks commonly recommended /r/Masks4All (such TIA BOTN KF94, Dr. Puri, Bluna Facefit, Powecom KN95 BonafideMasks, etc) ones Aaron tested videos, *are* “readily available sources” known suppliers. regularly buy BOTN Powecom masks, recieve within week two ordering. may pay bit would buying random ebay Amazon sellers, worth lot assurance im buying legitimate, independently tested masks. want able confidently say friends family, “buy KF94/KN95 masks xxxx.com, authorized resellers masks tested legit”, instead “go buy masks ‘maskdude6969’ eBay, theyre cheap *probably* legit”

Im necessarily saying *you’re* probably buying fake crap, you’re fact “smart” research sellers ebay. We’re saying average “civilian” wants buy legit stuff shouldnt wasting thier time level research buy thier stuff directly source.

(So sorry hear you’re sick get it! ) birthday celebration roommate yesterday, went see rocky horror picture show theatre. “since FL doesn’t require social distancing anymore it’s you”, thankfully still 6 ft apart wore masks (and young plus don’t interact public much), felt okay, many places don’t care. Setting stage destruction planet 2021. going world war shitshow. Lmao man instigated number constitutional crises via executive order one bats eye.

FEMA federal right? Bush appointed buddy Brownie heckuva job Katrina, rainman remember things once.  think Vietnam lockdown, especially Da Nang. hospitalization rate still around 10 percent? totally unavoidable. Obviously Trump done horrible job Europe bad shape also leaders much competent.

Even pandemic happened Obama administration would still issue, bad. Either way we’ll vaccine next months give health care workers vulnerable patients. take care first, we’ll reach herd immunity time spring. Damn, hope not. Fuck Donald ""I still like play down"" Trump forgot Black Friday mobs... France currently lockdown, least december US going hold major elections Damn. realize heard disease cancer high. Phuck. religious would say something like ""God help us"" make mistake thinking people power know exactly they're doing. 

""Let's dispel fiction Barack Obama know he's doing. knows exactly he's doing.""

- Marco Rubio, often I'm citizen yes let Covid get down. Turn frown upside down! start yes, good part, read thought ""you got first half"" accurate first part year, author model incorrectly assumed mortality rate covid low numbers close herd immunity started skew results immensily. Especially newly infected count ridiculous. said always risks getting flu shot I’m healthy underlying conditions it’s unnecessary risk take. initial post deleted? Sour mods agenda explain GA Comparing shithole poor third world country. cant fathom actually believing numbers reported Taiwan virus originated ccp’s nose. realise Conservative Party British Media one same, makes sense Yeah, taxes low.../s sub /r/politics circle jerk now. want real info check USA OK 'Murica Poland already has. Yea Idgaf anymore. “alarmist” saying could big deal January growing increasingly concerned February. 

I know worst time fatigued, don’t pandemic fatigue, moron fatigue. I’m going lock away two years twenties. 

I’m going die, didn’t want one initial cases spread however many people. it’s everywhere rest easy knowing wasn’t killed grandparents. Lol nope Thank god leader actually stuck around major catastrophe instead vacationing Hawaii. America first! Fuck... know, right? Like would American Coronavirus articles plastered front page American website... factor reality influenza cases dropped cliff.  course, article doesn’t try find one “truth”. would say that’s article’s main point, toxicity comes vain thought find true “science” within year living new virus without need sort balancing conflicting important interests. Honestly, shitty leader, advocating CDC experts recommended, stupid ass supporters would fall line, get program, we'd probably able nice things like... kids back school.

I guess opposite kinda makes bad leader. felt like peak hit years 20 :p alright. believe someone named Q inside knowledge government misdeeds... global ""US-equivalent"" 27,000 US recorded 101,500 cases day. US geographically spread simultaneous peak everywhere. Belgium not.  ""Let run course""

No absolutely fuck that. need lock down. Wow, that's say getting death sentence, makes logical sense mortality rate require hospitalization infections simultaneously would higher sum mortality rates virus individually.  talks rapid tests home development back March we're nowhere near it, fraud we're perfectly set winter months, course mean people close proximity transmit virus.

I envy whoever inherits they're sworn President New Year. matter, fit irony ceremony likely far less attended time regardless wins, account pandemic. 50 miles behind front bad many corporations companies don’t wanna give 1/10th even mountain gold people safe. feel like real issue here, people always dumb ignorant greed what’s controlling outcome right Pro-lockdown? Sky News told Dictator Dan going take away freedom. Eh, lot ancient viruses melting melting permafrost.  There’s guarantee one infect modern humans take pandemic, chances zero. covid affects America What? stupid? don’t think anyone reading except others read lol bad news 300 areas across world conflict water foreseen Flu virulent, least compared covid. Fox news needs taken air. murdering people. Supercomputer says yes. Dr. Li's posts shared widely WeChat partly outcry public wake death forced government apologize family sack government officials responsible mishandling early stages pandemic. China nearly strict level control internet North Korea - still major outbreak country, news would gotten out. Hubei government able keep outbreak wraps 3 weeks back nobody knew anything virus - point doctors across country knowing much there's absolutely way government could sweep major outbreak carpet.   heart disease contagious? Lockdowncels celebrating. Sickening :( CAMPEÃO MUNDO 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸☝🏼 [i got Flu R0 1.2 without measures. Covid much contagious. extremely high survival rate here’s media stirring drama. know anyone thought pandemic summer go poorly. obsessed convenient yet abstract concept ""freedom"", could stopped long ago.

It's embarrassing see consider patriotism compared countries. point I'm genuinely surprised dyed bald eagle changed traffic lights red, white, blue.

Hard believe I'm actually missing pre-covid life. I'm even asking improvement anymore, return normal activities. Probably dying, overwhelming capacity hospitals point unnecessary amount people die coronavirus extraneous circumstances due unable get medical care hospital filled brim covid patients. 

Several states already dealing full hospitals, point need send patients hospitals nearby cities states. pretty morbid prediction, really wouldn’t surprised see hospitals overwhelmed mere months time most. believe talking snakes science much fake news Honey, you? Black Friday sales here....

Good luck everybody.  mean rape addicts Maybe mask recommendation point scary shit. right. pray people start realizing shits hit fan, us gotta start wearing masks. don‘t think numbers comparable scaling number people testing Germany frequent tracing breaking down.

What however comparable dynamic i.e. doubling intervals weeks. won’t happen, many people ass backwards reason taking even half serious. don’t understand concept even flu, unknown different definite cure treatment somehow makes people feel relieved. know people die flu even right? ""Hey ~~shitass~~ world, wanna see speedrun?"" I'm doctor, covid-19 past spring thankfully able get it. think need that. 

When first suspected covid-19, used app get help remote doctor. pretty much told thing told you, quickly started feel even worse, tried get help PCP. recall every single medication take, one point taking like 4 5 different medications even still trying find relief home remedies. 

Good luck. Spreading virus US like playing Plague Inc easy difficulty. Thank fuck beyond peak /S worked front lines NY hospital peak pandemic April 2020, nearing end flu season 5 patients influenza COVID. died. reports colleagues NY hospitals similar patients infections. America never locked down. See lock downs Asia, that's China back business quick. lock crazy strict worked.  It’s great news outlets get post headline every day it’s still true Trump said would magically disappear April. guess meant April 2022. kill save families.

But wear masks though. Setting aside fact ""immunity"" covid lasts 3 months, explain vaccine trigger cytokine storm adults MIS-C children, immune responses virus? Congrats! 🏆🏆🏆 here:

Anything else wanna throw me? family told me, mayor done shit. county judge apparently one give stay home order. was, course, week family big indoor wedding much ruined. Jobs lost, lives lost, homes lost, theme parks shut down, shows shut down, loss movies, potentially permanent loss theatres, loss concerts, endless games movies media delayed years. pride-of-ignorance anti-science demographic I've watched grow like cancer last 10 years.

My life shit Government countrymen. get flags signs waved face every day countrymen screeching lemmings encourage walk cliff them. want out. get out. He's spewing Jr. president's son said medical experts talking surge cases ""truly went CDC data kept hearing new infections, like, 'Well, talking deaths?'"" Trump Jr. said, referring Centers Disease Control Prevention. ""Oh, oh, number almost nothing. we've gotten control thing, understand works. therapeutics able deal ""It's gone almost nothing,"" repeated, adding U.S. ""outperforming Europe positive know tough 🙁 Things pretty good Australia New Zealand two weeks everyone united. asked stay home two weeks. two weeks we’d beat virus. 

We couldn’t that. became 4 weeks. asked two weeks cuz failed. infringed Easter, though, that’s rift really began. “How dare demand skip easter. You’re infringing rights.” Patel? question whether help poor renters. course should. course want put people streets pandemic.

The question landlords deserve bear entire cost? government bail like way bail banks airlines. Stuuuuuuurgis studied sneezing coughing only. would interested see effectiveness breathing talking.

I mean, sneezing coughing anyway? go months without either I'm sick. People substituting face shield mask think might sneeze/cough public. point, it’s caricature used side debate. Take US president. constantly says Biden wants lock everything kill economy. anti-maskers, self-styled freedom fighters versed ideals free market libertarianism defence personal liberties.

But point course also caricature used anyone questions lockdown mask.

Each “team” creates favourite opponent effectively force scientific debate one teams. Americans evil.  USA! USA! USA! I'll bet every single person got tested right now, america, would break record. again. Great Barrington signers bitching one science community taking seriously more. Honestly, no. point I’m numb it. Don’t get wrong, I’m still everything wearing mask distancing, nothing surprises anymore. I’m tired. guess see next week brings election. Actually that's pretty good given countries test show massive symptoms.

7% means people testing case. in-laws shocked said flying across country see Thanksgiving Christmas. world live think safe thing do, especially things going now? We've moved onto covid - 21 bruh agree sentiment. Don’t forget one deliberate act terrorism one people ignorant. 

One result action, one result inaction. Two completely different things. 

I agree would difficult forgive though. Much difference way counted deaths vs guys it. Overall probably similar end result. lot strict are. People locked houses months face masks mandatory. Meanwhile Netherlands pretty much business usual. Probably not, possible It’s also poor comparison. Considering many US states geographically larger EU countries. Also different climate conditions. 

Winter Texas severe Montana, huge factor upturn cases.

So US whole really compatible single EU country. East Asia like China Singapore pretty much back normal lol That’s bad idea point LETS GOOOOOO...

back quarantine please. I'm Belgian. fully take numbers face value.

Our method reporting casualties ""unusual"", first wave reported pretty much every death covid, without much verification. probably pretty accurate nevertheless makes numbers look much higher comparison countries this.

That said, yes serious problem here. various reasons.

There relatively large part population truly believe bs part new world order program. tend completely ignore measures put place. small, densely populated transit country disaster waiting happen.

Combine (arguably still ongoing) political power struggle total mess governmental structure (I'll spare details enormous amount autonomous decision makers small country) get.. this. company canceled flue shots due covid...

And case home (Daughter positive) even though wife WFH since march...  Always trying greatest feel man literally take every precaution. work home. Wash hands whenever touch door. shit delivered. 

I’ll still get cuz idiot roommate doesn’t wash hands coming home work. I’m calling now. life may danger. important, make sure follow steps *immediately*:

**Step 1: get medical advice redditors.**

That it. questions, ask me; *I'm redditor*  Even happens, know go again, time smaller scale better preparation. 

Melbourne gone hundred days isolation, Sydney good time without major rising. got popped using line. bots atheists! Fauci GT talks fighting H1N1 47 percent every day week Armenia... isolating due exposure rona. reckoning coming. two instacart orders two different stores today generic toilet paper. ended swapping 9 pack Charmin (apparently store had) freaking $19! almost passed *away* saw price rolls toilet paper True. Frontlines extremely fixed nurses werent trenches.

Not fact makes efforts less valuable. explains didnt deaths. r/Whooosh owe interest deferment? *least* landlords offered tax credit rent missing. china enters chatroom .. tests reliable. infected still travel. 7% population it!? Europe. disagree you. think gist question much ""what specific law allows this"" rather ""how fair?"" ""Big red wave coming"". guess meant bloody wave. Or..... It'll go away.. man said Oval office Ideally everyone truly stayed home two weeks virus would spread die out. won’t happen though. Mad max world Pics tanks? Surely somebody got picture. Wuhan city 9 million. almost like kids went back increased That's true, prior infection instills immunity lead well. mostly associate herd immunity vaccination due much cleanly-cut demonstration incidents theorized happened naturally. Woody Harrelson believes 5G conspiracy.

Celebrities perfectly capable morons without supporting Trump. people help you. Contact GP local CAHMS service. understand animosity towards her. fault? almost want go get purpose right don’t get 60% population hospital beds.... That's true people exceed speed limits. folks take issue specific speed limits given area. pretty much one contests general value speed limits general traffic laws like Lights Stop signs. literally nobody cares. one buddies goes flordia state tells absolutely NOBODY gives flying fuck there. one. fair Necessary r/FuckNestle  Maybe government create rent guarantee insurance, renter fails pay, government step take care rent specific period time. Yes do. know someone took one toes fell USA! USA! USA! That's China works. lot people give shit. seen last night lockdown, national superspreading event Dude, forget stopping anything. US way past point. curious flu even thing year since technically closed borders. know shipments come flu usually overseas ends totally stupid this? Please provide one example study list summary relevant actual conclusion... can. last month europe bit cooler. Definitely people spending almost time inside compared outside raining lot across continent. know cause surge one meeting outside anymore lot places. respiratory illness. anything's affecting brains, medication used combat it. way: Germany lost control heading similar numbers relation population. True, guess planned season 3 already. Possible silver lining.

The general population lax response part well controlled. Hopefully outbreak big enough teach ignorance people big enough kill tens thousands short time.

Sadly dont think get public compliance everyone noes one two people dead. big figures start die it. Going need cages.../s Absolutely horrific.

Well, that's like opinion man. word Jr. president's son said medical experts talking surge cases ""truly went CDC data kept hearing new infections, like, 'Well, talking deaths?'"" Trump Jr. said, referring Centers Disease Control Prevention. ""Oh, oh, number almost nothing. we've gotten control thing, understand works. therapeutics able deal ""It's gone almost nothing,"" repeated, adding U.S. ""outperforming Europe positive way.""

1,000 deaths day ""almost nothing."" one numbers name person life. He's talking prepare medical resource prior criticality. Otherwise impossible make useful policies. 

Yeah, counties go one thing common: populations got believe something: either science, local government local hospitals.

Lockdown == nothing people cooperate. 

Jesus, dead man right. didn't. expected, spikes starting 3-4 weeks schools started. school started different times around country, spikes happened different times. state, spikes started going September climbing ever since. frustrating part school administrators keep saying spike expected, nothing worry about. like hearing say saw car heading going wrong way freeway, there's nothing worry know car collide someone likely cause death destruction. Knowing negative outcome foolish action make outcome less negative; gives people false feeling control.

Apply logic around America, are. can't leave country without getting tested, nah really.. Yet many people claim humans predictable.  listen idiots sub.

This cannot said enough. 100,000 now. like high/low numbers time late/predicting come earlier? Donald said controlling ! :( seriously blaming her? makes sense. way Europe did, giving fck Yeah, terrible analogy. real world conditions, slowing drummer fucking timing up, half time takes amount drugs would take straight kill them... people overreacted panick buying people think basically harmless

What basing on? Yep! sure are! state 67 %of deaths occuring nursing homes. kids okay.. Took lot planning make happen keeps USA surpass number deaths WW2. Yes, approaching axis never meeting taken context  photo. seeing lot recently. Effing disgusting, mention really bad environment. take home throw away people. looking like good summer guess simple happy death toll, since going well last time.

but worries, get soon enough continue. Intrusion privacy widespread asymptomatic testing going US? 

When next impossible, violates Americans Civil Liberties, China fake that. Normal never coming back. 2021, 2022, even 2050. pandemic *permanent*. Turned wrong corner. gotten bunch folks work. Normally pitch perfect patient customer service. folks. goal get building fast possible, say single word achieve goal. Agree. It’s also seems increasingly communicate suppress data points factors government mandated measures responsible difference severity Europe East Asia. example [genome wide risk factor study published Nature September notable Neanderthal risk haplotype occurs frequency 30% south Asia whereas almost absent east Asia.

It’s staying positive good news well made public health efforts anything helping fight covid-19, anywhere. Instead get *European democracies can’t handle covid* *Should done like [east asian country] lol*. 

It’s convinient ignore data compare countries like schoolyard kids going ”My dad beat dad.” That’s entire population state live Australia. It’s crazy. Glad approve.

Now tell things told paints China bad light ... good America’ rounded corner yeah saw simpsons, illnesses mr burns couldnt go door!  people stay home :)

My mom got call guy court today said covid come in. said absolutely not, mail proof positive test reschedule. Mother fucker CAME ANYWAY.

I'd love ask people they've ever flu. common cold! Even COVID-19 *was* ""just flu,"" that'd still suck. US reported 4x cases, 30x population. 7.5x less cases reported per capita. death cult.

Theres nothing significant east, west south thousands miles, objectively pretty isolated. Europe's getting fucked US' turn comments

Really?  Ok, wrote place anyway. 

So tired Sweden politicized. seen people basically hoping Swedes die prove concervatives wrong. 

There easier, humane way proving right wing people wrong scoring politically. 

Just explain Sweden lot, heard immunity strategy, life same. And, right wing people want less repressive volontary response also change country core. I.e higher taxes rich, public health care, employee rights etc.

Also absurd Sweden considered unique. Lockdown scale, scale Swedens  volontary/virtual lockdown Norways lockdown similar eachother Norway example spain/australians ""housearrest"" type lockdown. Illustrate scale 1 10 1 life 2019 10 full housearrests citizens. Sweden 3, Norway 4 Spain 9.


Its like left right agree Sweden didnt anything. wrong. fighting Sweden good bad. Fact 15-17 countries worse (more count excess deaths) despite hard lockdowns. lot lot better Sweden, hard lockdowns without.

Just clear consider left, im dissapointed international left taking opportunity turn concervatives arguments them.

Sweden left country left response pandemic, essentially paying people stay home instead much cheaper - locking people up. Conservatives usually hates Sweden beacause left politics. reason dont time misunderstood Swedish left approach. “certain” lame duck. think everyone listen again, government slowly building another lockdown whole time.

I agree Western governments certainly US done more. I'm also slightly concerned sort response, exactly foreign policy spin Chinese state putting this, ""system"" succeeded democracies failed.

I amazed see people queuing cold rain maintaining decent level distance them. Lol Biden rallies billions cells; one cell dont need reproduce 2. need 2 different cells producing 2 different virus. technically mean body fight 2 viruses although similar ths same. Im experts might want ask someone doctor degree clarify this. freaking scary, jeez. it! us jobs allow us stay locked homes 8 months, us brave world everyday enter it, makes one less concerned paranoia surrounding covid - voluntary like saying
- without negative test must home fined 1600€
- jobs stores require show covid certificate get service meant preview meet challenge that’s already killed least quarter million Americans 8mos, much confidence leaders navigate climate change? :( tried handling like hurricanes Trump style. nobody considered nuking Covid?? disappointed USA. Sad end American empire already here, we're watching death throes. Swineflu! Swineflu disaster!! 

Actual - freaking - attempt deflection. Repeated too. slip tongue inject-bleach ""sarcasm"".

But everybody gets got. fine. Jr says ""deaths nothing"". 1000 people die day? Must fake news. /s doubt going much without closing schools non-essential work places aswell. many cases schools lax quarantine rules there, carry virus home parents may spread workplace etc. infection numbers think really needed drastic measures least 2 weeks lockdown-light version depending numbers. live (so far) low impact state. already working home school full time (online). much free time now, since I'm driving household members around. 

I'm also introvert. go bars parties. contact extended family, missing family gatherings time mentally ill 'mother.' Wealth tax. That's rich really afraid of. Also flu tends migrate around world seasons change, harsh travel restrictions many 'early season' areas aimed containing excluding Covid preventing getting vulnerable plague pits like US. 100,000 new cases USA would equivalent 25,300 new cases Germany.

We 19,000 new cases since yesterday Germany. probably reach USA level next week then. :-(

(Yes, relating population good comparison. high numbers nevertheless.) Yep, NZ rely extensively modeling, last two outbreaks modeling told us lock turned right decision, outbreak modeling told us lock one city turned right decision.

It's scary base decisions maths everyone's hunch lock goes show hunch's wrong. curious question. Since mainland China “claims” Taiwan part it, “technically” also Chinese citizenship? Fuck me, think mental strength another lockdown. soon furlough ended GF lost job, searching day everyday there's fuck about, plus millions job searching too. Fuck knows we'll pay rent come December another lockdown mostly achieve killing jobs businesses. thing happen, we'll lockdown it'll Christmas people party spread virus doubt there'll kind eat help bullshit January we'll really spread time weather cold we'll really spread it. enough I've enough government. praying nonces government gone. thesun.co.uk may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Oh yeah turn corner! Lockdowns last measure country, citizens government, failed hygiene TTI. news title next weeks different number.... chance Donald get media time back election, even people vote oof It’s transmission, it’s severity cases. It’s also thing matters, course. things point favourable situation east asia human coronaviruses basically cradle there. circulate ”east asian transmission network” much like flu viruses, larger degree cross reactive immunity result.

This take praise away well many east asian countries handled outbreaks, infectious disease preparedness way better countries. Probably reason. Woohoo! tired winning yet? living younger small geographic part world NY, mostly like Jews. Singapore taste like Asians. South Beach taste like gays. Dubai taste like Muslims.

Algebraic extension makes people speak like you, better. leader calling ChinaFlu. bit late, ? got T? That's really flunking country sad anymore :(. best protect work keep going, heart breaks kids days. Breaking records everyday Unfortunately reaction get every conservative points Sweden excuse nothing. That’s absolutely true. Get numbers straight. are.
Every expert agrees way virus spreads. many studies showing exactly happens one two infected persons sharing room others.
That average redditor claim, science.
Data also showing people covid asymptomatic percentage grows younger population. also science.

It believed asymptomatic would less viral load, thus less chance infecting others. main reason schools reopened.

Recent studies second wave prove viral load high also asymptomatic cases. Science-wise next step determine actual risk schools verify statistically significant difference viral load symptoms asymptomatic. addition study performed taking account different age groups. 

While wait results, considering infected kid lives parents impossible properly perform isolation context, believe government do?

Because claiming schools dangerous sure scientist needs specific data. contact tracing failing numbers already know students tend asymptomatic definitely underestimation cases. quick tests performed daily everyone entering school cannot expect scientist prove something. report get.

Let's see example.
Factual data shows RT italy skyrocketed exactly 2 weeks schools reopening. 1800 cases day 2 weeks reopenings, 31000 4 weeks after. 17x increase 4 weeks.
When bars restaurants reopened 10 weeks cases went 4x DOWN.
Tourist season accounted 6X increase 4 weeks.
After vacation season ended first 1/2 weeks schools reopening 4 weeks cases increased 1.5x.

So scientific proof schools reason numbers skyrocketing, hand serie events corresponding infection curve. addition know considered generally high risk (sharing rooms, wearing masks, overcrowded public transportation, living many people... things fit normal day student italy) not.

That really matter connecting dots. Something science supposed do. Governments should. Yeah like lockdowns going stop people practicing religions, tell dumbass Christians still went church. Well another years days like near herd immunity - there's end sight. cared ton idiots still think covid hoax fight wearing mask . Bunch dumbasses.  ⸮ &lt;= official sign sarcasm\^\^ news talk LOT though. like non stop talk flu shots think shortage “tamiflu ” whatever distilled white vinegar something similar smell, thanks! Thanksgiving prepare kill Grandma!

Honestly seems like toss liquid acid might actually weigh individual micrograms dried blotter? like doses sugar cubes might weigh less dropper? liquid that's probably amount got share vs strip two.

Sorry ramble, impression acid charges measured number hits looked and, thankfully, look like fomite transmission unlikely. greatly reduce damage halloween. teach Republic Texas founded response Mexico outlawing slavery?

""Covid Good's gift left"" -Jane Fonda minimizing. pointing fucked situation Belgium record US still 7.5x less Belgians going trough. already think indirect, people hateful Swedes (a minority reddit notwithstanding).

It's country strict lockdown life turned upside must hurt see Sweden much less ok. feels unfair. 

[Meanwhile bit busybody isn’t I’ve heard friends working healthcare south Texas, many patients treating undocumented Mexicans seeking treatment US, course adds states covid #s. That’s insane Mexico high! reporting link there. look say New Jersey link NJ dept health ect. numbers accurate, think want trying help think mean 'as late next week'. Well, landlord body, right evict bad tenants. March year, flu season, doctors scientists saying. flu even get covid test.

The evidence caught season meaning patients need test both. guess what? We're running short flu test materials covid test materials. Stalin probably never said that, fyi. sourced Washington Post column 40s nowhere else prior. Nah, covid spread like wildfire China South Korea start. government got shit together. Exactly, worst part got painted country worst far truth isolated everything else might bearing context anything.

Her medical advice, wrote paper, attribute anyone, took words isolation. probably alright. Probably kill you. 

Now early stuff CDC masks pointless, fucking dumb. 20 million dead 21 million wounded. wish people would stop counting wounded dead WW1. Besides it’s 2020 fuck 1.2 million people dying stay fuck back wear mask. I’d understand tell cave men since don’t know better fuck every one else’s excuse? got flu 18 months ago knocked crap 10 days. Check using Google data. southern hemisphere countries peaks winter relaxing, suddenly northerners huge spikes tired winning yet? It’s terrible idea, learned last time isn’t effective stopping anything economy. Exactly shit! trend general alot countries right now, mostly driven healthy young people die virus. avarage age dying Covud 19 82yo, people nursing homes protected now. Increase found cases equal deaths. Oh please, education system mess sure shitting frontlines best financial help ridiculous administrative red tape dick move. I’m white knighting AR, I’m there, experienced system, worked schools college. 

My graduating class 28 people 11 us started kindergarten together. experienced “joke” Arkansas therefore know dismissal educators dick move. 

Property taxes fund schools low income areas always going suffer compared higher income areas. It’s systemic problem. 3% fatality rate, means 3,000 people death warrants signed.

Sadly, even completely remove results, still end nearly 25% chance catch household member.

A 1/4 chance. Literally better chance rolling number want 6 sided dice.... added in, literally flip coin, ~50% chance.

And specifically state happens age groups. Meaning, stupid shit open schools. COULD PREDICTED THIS?

So stupid. honestly deserve survive species.

FYI, anyone wondering. CDC article states bad, recommend person room, bathroom. Ideally, EVERYONE house wears mask times. Especially contact carrier. someone caring person, also kept separate anyone household severe risk complications.

 let's honest Homeoffice germany option. Way conservative internet infrastructure worst western world even third world countrys better connection rural germany.
Also jobs done Homeoffice couldn’t get tested March Germany unless hospital China, Italy, Iran. symptoms gave influenza test. people working make better. They're ignored. 

Don't let bad actors charge things make misanthrope. Direct anger towards teeming masses idiots hold accountable. 

Really fault lies leadership.

People ALWAYS stupid. good leadership shepherd crisis like this.

We adrift storm boat listing captain says clear sailing see. V\*O\*T\*E\* According Dr Fsuci, first wave would certain period time cases 10K. 

So I'm afraid third wave. third peak first wave.  got backwards. vaccine trick immune system got disease without making sick. can't reach herd immunity naturally, vaccine can't either. really share sources Sun. cannot emphasize trashy newspaper is. Here’s report CNN references: can’t find verbiage here. nowhere near medicine science today

The medicine today may help reducing fatality rate, far exactly nothing curb spread (outside social distancing, exactly invention modern science). That's actually exactly works, language evolves Saskatchewan, don’t know anyone that’s it. ""It"" democracy, health, wealth, emotional stability, decency, national pride... VOTE. It’s first accountability check. it, Reddit! Exponential growth means number new cases function current active cases.

..I think major bulk grocery store MD covid outbreak addition writing employees calling get tested (after exposure already tested positive), they’re bringing employees locations without telling many people out. need shut test everyone almost certainly won’t. 25, prohibitive, overwhelming favorite survive covid everything else besides cancer well. mean fall 1837, Joseph Smith confronted Cowdery rumor meeting attended least three others. meeting, Cowdery refuted rumor Joseph confessed him. 

Oliver excommunicated number reasons well, spreading rumors Joseph. Funny bring witness plates, returned church 1848 record denying plates holy manifestation Godly power. figured would least got excommunicated fact never did. 

He strained relationship Joseph 1832-1838. It’s possible spread rumors try usurp power away Joseph. But, guess we’ll never know sure, we? defend faith. good rest day! worry, disappear election ;) AAARRGGHH baby lots friends, family helped us tremendously first several weeks providing meals every days. people gave us gift cards GrubHub, first experience much business model sucks. realized literally asked people mentioned GrubHub / DoorDash etc, “hey awkward you’re considering providing food way want send us cash? Wither well get food you’ll save money bc companies suuuuuccckkk” “Terrific job” - Donald J. Trump reported Michigan cases right people Flu COVID. 8 weeks available general public, events coming back

No way. Restrictions might dropped point vaccine rollout (if truly effective case numbers actually go down), event companies *begin plan* events happen year after. that? That’s terrifying! Back Christmas whole family got flu. took youngest tested positive flu something else also weren’t sure gave us antibiotic safe. flu takes much you, can’t imagine getting flu covid. neither seasons either places... Appreciate them. care lot. might true scale single cell, probably there's one infection per cell, literally trillions cells infect. warned this, Fauci! Science wrong right. collecting evidence, testing hypotheses, refining understanding world. thinking critically everything.

Best boat, tremendous boat Orange sus. fucking job assholes; aren’t free choose part want do. 🖕😷🖕 *elect* Snake Plisskin. happens, Kurt Russell *allows* it. “Our doctors get money someone dies Covid. know that, right?"" Mr Trump said falsely.  “I mean, doctors smart people.”  No. pretty meaningless.

The way would matter planned eridicate Sars cov2 vaccination (which really seen anyone suggesting recently), virus non human reservoirs would make difficult. Well, blew past Civil War combat deaths milestone  100,000 + new cases day big deal. cannot understand checked Associated Press CNN, big banner news item. Crazy times sure going double soon enough. Probably millions daily cases February, march, April.  never tested. Wasnt strange celebrities rich people covid world March? many it? Simple. Millions rich got tested first.

The first wave clearly massive. I'm afraid confusing said.

I never said anything ""no hope vaccine"". simply said guarantee it, true. could announce successful vaccine next week. could another year find one. course hope, know invented it'll available everyone.

Containing virus waiting vaccine cure either. people infected mass rates, happens? Hospitals become overloaded. start run equipment save lives (e.g. ventilators). makes death rate become even higher infected can't get care need. However, ""flatten curve"", hospitals able keep up. Even ""worst case scenario"" number people becoming infected end, due longer period time hospitals able keep up, less people die. Salty available US? country little flu vaccines delivered people managed get one. pharmacies managed got little quantity like 4 5 syringes, even managed get recipe doctor able sign list get one become available, month ago ~50 list told probability actually getting one near zero new deliveries. December, likely January February. Oh know exponential.

Question is, many days double?

The last time checked, doubling rate depending country looked somewhere 3 and... want say 9 days. recall USA tracking at, last time saw number. whatever number back probably less important whatever trend past week two. Thanksgiving month away. think upward trend continue month? would mean thousands dead. Ping US stimulus package... many people scared get tested (going hospital expose sure) we're certainly missing mild &amp; asymptomatic cases. IgM typically matures within 3 days since symptomatic fades half life &lt;5 days recovery, mostly indicates ongoing infection. Different labs PCR differently may lead excessive false negatives. Nasal swab sensitive probing deeper. Saliva PCR supposed sensitive subject (detectable) artifacts labs put effort ruling out. fuckin liberal coward. Liberals like position.  got hit hurricane Zeta south leaving around 1.9 million without power. People tend forget stuff like COVID doesn’t stop new disaster struck.

This hopeless, moment one us follow rules, over.
individual responsibility also exists, everything ordered daddy state stick carrot. U-S-A, U-S-A, U-S-A “It go away, zero.” something. Lockdowns never plan. 

They’re inevitable conclusion don’t plan Trump specify Easter it’d gone? must meant 2022. People wear masks shoppings, stay max 30 minutes talk (much).

in family gathering people wear masks, 4 hours badly ventilated room enough infect everyone living room.

Dang that’s got good ring  So...what they’re absolutely picture? I’m terrible maths forgive I’ve got wrong. 230,000(dths) x 100 / 9,100,000 (inf) = 2.5%. Approx based reporting WHO. 
And forget incredible increase “unexplained deaths). ask got 0.4% figure from? think you’d look individual country’s death rate. know Nordic regions (famous medical care) performed well etc but...... expected, ~800million vs ~300 million population. US 700 per million deaths....nearest European France 400 per million.
 Ratio cases/deaths telling stat. I'm curious anyone studied mouth breathing. main consistent symptom loss smell gets nose eyes? doubt people would wear nose pinchers (like swimming) goggles month wear damn mask I've thinking while. Then, assuming Biden wins, *completely utterly unstoppable* time takes office, worst death rate occur him, Republicans shamelessly use show “bad” response COVID was. I'm AACO report thing. Definitely knock people. feel like overall people pretty well (at least I've limitedly seen) knock that.

Come on. there’s 8000000000 testing positive evuhreee dayuh!!!!! ridiculous. countries take week can't keep speed testing.

All tests China positive within 24 hours. 45 million infected, 1 million dead globally. Thats .02% death rate. think we're gonna ok. Although might look better deaths covid rather war casualty  isn’t. protests riots led zero right? problem eventually ones comply would quit pay isn’t worth hassle stress job point. places it’s barely worth now. 
Some would stay pride, many would quit go elsewhere. true, hospitals fine.

Definitely lots transmission severe cases happen without risk haplotype too. Viruses complex, course major risk factors age comorbidities ”override” effect many places.

Another anecdote consider Iran Italy got early severe scenarios. 

Iranian hunter-gatherer genome closely linked southern European genome, especially findings Northern Italy. known studying haplotypes also apparent language groups developing along lines migration patterns. 

Another one migrating groups ended East Africa. African ethnicities, Ethiopian Somali stand disproportionally affected deaths, example Sweden. Along Turkish, Iranian Iraqi, exactly ethnicities highest count said haplotypes.

Remember didn’t universal basic income. Remember weren’t forced/pressured undergo vaccine. Remember used earn honest days living working hard instead leeching Universal Basic Income? Remember nations government instead worldwide super government? Remember big tech wasn’t tracking every word breath? guess 6,000 18 million. 98% confidence interval. Calendar winter. 

I include possibility deadly strain society becoming bit intelligent Fox + OANN decide want actually help fight pandemic instead spread disinformation. neighborhood had. fucking. Block party. Last night. pizza truck came, outdoors “social distancing”, fuckton costumed kids running around feel like I’m taking crazy pills  recently lost grandpa past Sunday Covid complications it. grandpa tested positive well. live relatively small rural towns Ohio, everywhere. Rural probably bad cities virus. Maybe Jr read “0” “10th” place ranking. Totally plausible, right? 1. China working closely WHO.
2. even China done say, complaining China now?
No matter China does, every reason critical, Chinese, know well
Remember western media mocked Wuhan city sealed? Read room.  280 deaths. :( guy whines awful lot. Thanks this. Sort like demented time capsule glimpse initial stages pandemic. sobering Redditor saying USA *will never reach 500k cases*.  

Oh poor little lamb. Redfield straight Sirus XM Doctor radio flat stated 12-30 silent drivers pandemic. believing director CDC go ahead shut fuck up. Literally shpeal day:

""How you"" 

*scan items. Hand receipt*

""Have good day, NEXT""

there reason continue make people talk space hundreds customers next hours.  United States Europe outliers badly managed pandemic

I'd say SE Asia outlier well handled it.

Central America South America also shat bed. India also done well obviously always would've uphill struggle population density major cities, difficult tell Africa lack testing. mhm, made worst :) good testing April? serious? UK testing 15 times today beginning April. arguing lockdowns. trend. things look like couple weeks. I’m saying statement infections today spring (most probably) correct. really don’t understand you’re insinuating here. Every country affected this, others. know who’s affected least? draconian rule law. You’re welcome move safe virus kills 0.2% infects. WTF wrong America. stereotype stupid religious zealots starting look like may upgraded fact. still biggest unknown factor all, kids 10, considered spreaders? disagree, there’s pandemic on. don’t go gather massive groups.

If Covid much higher death rate like SARS.. 😂 wouldn’t many protests long It’s government keeps suppressing actual figures I’m surprised forecast off. increased testing may component cases, sarcasm comes Trump claiming testing reason rise cases.

From: [The Covid Tracking COVID-19 cases rise across United States, claims circulating case increases (mostly entirely) due expanded testing, indicate spike infections. data support expanded testing main force behind case rises, would expect see testing case increases rise together. we’re seeing: Since October 1, seven-day average new cases risen 61 percent, tests 14 percent period. Meanwhile, number patients currently hospitalized COVID-19 risen 40 percent October thus far. Case growth always mattered, cases rise, hospitalizations invariably follow.


When considering diseases, simply tests doesn’t mean we’ll get positives. Trump/Pence claim “swine flu” would bad if, if, .... fact matter 100k daily covid cases (in US) unacceptable basic precautions form “leadership” could significantly reduced infections death. America: Hold beer... pAnDeMiC Lol, Son...have checked US forecasts lately? watching 10ks quarterly filings major industry?

The US going miserable winter struggling economy well 2022 point.

The US played hard fast Covid, hoping ignored long enough they’d skirt election win.

The gains/losses weren’t economic - decidedly political. We’ll see pay next week. 

The study laughably irrelevant - severe infections interesting, inherent problem. inherent problem caring cases continue increase.

Becoming *more* sick get Covid isn’t good (although study US also deal obesity health factors also negatively affect Covid patients); but, here’s golden nugget appear missed:

*YOU GET SEVERE CASE COVID INFECTED COVID. REDUCING INFECTIONS INHERENTLY REDUCES SEVERE CASES*

God, isn’t hard. Seems honest somehow. hid candy around house like scavenger hunt 3 year old loved it. told year ago much money I’d pay 4 pack Clorox Wipes 2020, I’d slowly backed away smiling avoiding eye contact. Check newspaper forums everywhere, soon see plenty going around.

That, similar idiotic stuff like ""its really nothing flu"" true large amount reinfections, meaning Covid likely mutating faster expected video: her. entire facepalm compilation Idaho fucked. 91 year old Grandmother got back April somehow remained asymptomatic multiple underlying condition including stage 3B cancer. Feb girlfriend’s coworker came back Milan. known 4 others well. Reporting NYC area want clear, think situation bad deplorable, impact actual patient care minimal zero. impact primarily media wants report things. 

That hospital district wanting evacuate patient would rely solely known fishy govt. website rather simply picking phone little silly. Random police checks home streets. found outside without negative certificate testing, get fined 1000 euro. I’d guess number higher job. Can’t tell many times I’ve heard people come leave without turning sink. wash hands bathroom like sane adult hand sanitizer office. good ones use warm water blow dry butt, it’s probably pretty good. Yes child's early development pretty important. Xinjiang Kashgar epidemic prevention control news conference reported 24:00 October 30 18:00 October 31, Xinjiang reported 61 new cases asymptomatic infections. Among them, 46 cases reported Shufu County, 15 cases reported neighboring Kizilsu Kirgiz Autonomous Prefecture's Aktau County, Khazhekachik Township Pilal Township. 18:00 31 October, # Xinjiang 51 confirmed cases#, referred asymptomatic infected people. Rounding corner! lockdown come. we're basing actions spiking countries indication, common trend seems be:

Try avoid lockdown small restrictions tighten restrictions tighten restrictions tighten restrictions lockdown healthcare system projected collapse

Very cool joe. Depends area though.

I live New Orleans it’s 50/50 recently whether Christmas party comfortable outdoors. years ago literally couldn’t go later warm.

But basically country excluding Southern California, Florida, areas...yeah it’s crazy.

I’m sure heaters you’d need short supply too. inevitable post-election protests?  need disingenous champ went ahead chose absolute lowest value compare to. saying statement infections today spring (most probably) correct.

It's semantics point mate looks pretty suss making arguments. Sure. Based fact UK testing, revealing cases, still looking immense numbers highly infectious disease. 

So case number infected April actually higher (but statistically shown due lack testing). took 5000 recorded postive daily cases average shut everything down. 15-20k daily reported still deciding. *anyone* success fighting this? 

Or country isn’t island. Yay, we’re winning? Unfortunately, nothing change states. looked Texas, live, second place new cases daily, Illinois first. see less less people wearing masks whenever I’m about. can’t work home kid school, it’s probably matter time get it, assuming haven’t already it. Even martial law declared, don’t see many Texas businesses closing without fight. someone lost mom last nigh, tell gotta hope never give I’m going say favorite (again): “it’ll gone Easter” Europe kicking asses.

New cases per million October 30th:
US: 306
Europe: 404 Exactly number likley reduce next year vaccine released. 

Normally longer virus around less deadly is. East people communal nature, deeper sense obligation elders. 

This probably part reason Japan avoided carnage seen Italy despite similarly aged population lots people cramped, mountainous space. you’re 70? Probably never 

If you’re 50? Probably summer. don’t see grandma. 

I think timeline different depending age risk band. think normal comes sooner less susceptible virus. Combine current severity statistics first gen vaccine works - can’t see covid thought mind 50 that. 

The older cohort? Yeah, bet won’t see “normal” years. They’ll take additional steps mitigate risk. 2020 nutshell

Next is, ""when put butter bread gets tastier"" xD We’re doomed confirmed cases. total number infected individuals likely 100,000 majority pandemic. Study links Trump rallies 30,000 cases 700 deaths

I wish fighting coronavirus hard! would fantastic win! Drill baby drill! Though


 🤦‍♂️ non-sterilizing vaccine eradicate virus reduces symptoms flu-like illness less prevent this. We'll months. best numbers... ones ever seen numbers like this... greatest numbers ever... people come me, smartest people ever, even doctors, smart people, tell great we’re turning corner Scoring skyrocket league.

Poor, poor goalies. degree social distancing likely continue even vaccine next year, says Prof Hiscox, ""less stringent"". also believes at-risk groups may still need ""shelter"" themselves, take extra precautions, uncertainty amount protection.

Which part discussing exactly?  Seems like they’ve hit artificial plateau, ie cases pick via testing completely right I'm afraid. speak, multiple Sherriff's depts. US refusing enforce lockdown rules areas actually ordered government. huge percentage population refuses wear mask ""freedom"", actively fight (and mean violently) wearing one yourself.

I fucking disgusted American right now. thing gives shred hope knowing others bothered this, truly heartbreaking little common decency society days. west? China moron Crimes humanity. 

I’m tired prosecuting presidents crimes. already deep seeded distrust government is. trump everyone involved least trial, fear nail coffin public trust government Usually wouldn't, 5,000 people died week mean anything them. that's 5,000 families lost someone able make memories, see them, tell love them. America water Maybe test results thrown alongside ballots Mask wearing 20.000+ new daily cases. (equiv. 80.000 US)

In Europe? Europe larger population USA. Go want to, don’t go don’t. 

I’m going friends tonight. life can’t live it??? can't speak countries US statement holds weight backed facts. cares act allows financial gain hospitals reporting covid deaths. covid, covid deaths money. Two things:

1) reduced hospital stay initial results held, anything reduce stays Good Thing
2) Early-stage Rx effect still study. fact President received treatment informative - indicating best thinking reflects. virus never eradicated. 

So, given this, socially distance forever? It’s little sus trump rallies causing “not protests”. Seems kinda agenda-y. someone doesn’t support trump even looks bad lol one's killing spree--was. always people like sub, even majority. Can't fail try - USA think U.S copy France currently restarted December, 1 : re-confinement. TYP-I-CAL.
You get called lacking understanding research back thread. actually beyond hope. guarantee go far beyond school. lack basic skills actually research. genuinely feel sorry you. Good luck life. 🐑 🐑 🐑 Let's pin inept govt response

There FAR many people zero consideration anybody themselves. 

We severe lack empathy, critical thinking, general ""being part society"" attitude earliest vaccines publically distributed likely enough reduce mortality bad flu season. end this? know last Plague Pandemic lasted century, ended 1960?

We joke Plague, imagine chaos evolved form Pneumonic Plague, 100% fatality rate treatment, Instead juiced Cold virus 2% fatality rate without treatment. go away say, we're rounding turn, we're rounding corner, going away.

- [Trump debate Biden last Covid takes fridays hospitals get overwhelmed? mean I'd ok conspiracy depopulated stupid people. Sadly, not. checked logs

heh win! “The data used Johns Hopkins positivity recently changed. counted person’s first test, better reflects retests.”

I thought counting double negatives bad thing?  This! another joke murraaaayy Honest question.

Why rallies generate Covid cases deaths.

But protests, riots, lakers gathering, ANTIFA gatherings “numbers reflect increase cases”?

I know damn sure packed people protests riots Didn’t Melbourne come 111 day lockdown devastated economy?  headed summer.

That’s win? d614g mutation spread North Italy February we've known contagious roughly 9 months now. Australia 0.15 - that's counting overseas arrivals placed mandatory quarantine arrival. Australia 76 cases last 7 days 56 returned citizens overseas mandatory quarantine. emergency alert stated hot spot counties mandatory face regulation then. three counties considered hot spot counties.

National guard/US army gets involved state police toast numbers usually lowest weekends many labs report numbers Monday - Friday? want eliminate 25% contacts - closing indoor dining restaurants, bars also closing gyms would get us based contact tracing report saw day showed 26% infections came places. add closing offices work home would help.

If haven’t closed every banquet hall already - high priority list. isn’t game whataboutisms guy. Trump rally protesting overzealous brutal tactics police fundamentally different. 

The rally’s serve real purpose stroke ego Trump supporters. lot times without masks single effective tool virus right now. 

The protesters full people fighting better future. forced stare virus face try fight injustices happening hands people tasked protection. 

Big difference reasoning execution. Forreal. One biggest fears majority Americans still believe handled pandemic better ""shithole"" countries. sincerely believe government could start forcing Americans live straw huts eat bread water, lot would still gladly scream number one, must much worse everywhere else. government court ruled said illegal grey area. governor made order stating city/county order contradicts state order void. Texas AG said enforceable sueing stop it. multiple layers government sided police, pretend unilaterally police saying this. Rounding curve guys. One day it'll disappear, right? fail modify population behaviour vastly engance TTI efficiency thats likely scenario.

I suppose cold season restrictions remain 'opening up' people think. says, knowing nothing government works. traced 1 million cases world wide Chinese eating bat wet market happens front virus research lab yes correct 

that right wing talking point utter bullshit girlfriend got sick Monday, recovered Tuesday night symptoms since, tested positive yesterday COVID.. I’ve 24/7 last 2 weeks haven’t experienced symptoms, live 1 bedroom apartment work home jobs hasn’t left apartment, likelihood haven’t caught probably close 0. Assuming I’ll show something eventually, it’s probably 10 days since original exposure. first wave hit Australia/NZ March/April going winter. second wave hit Victoria (which genuine second wave) probably somewhat exacerbated winter, daily new cases already rapidly declining mid-late August. New South Wales small outbreaks local transmission leaking Victoria winter, contained effective public health response - TTI people!  


The perceived overall low density Australia (hurr durr inhospitable wasteland) New Zealand (hurr durr sheep) often used wave away success, highly urban counties concentrated cities - particularly Australia. 79% Australians live 20 largest cities, 66% largest five. NZ similarly urbanised, distributed, five largest cities account 47% population. Urban densities Aus/NZ generally similar/slightly higher urban areas US, pretty much everywhere Aus/NZ performed better. city worst outbreak (Melbourne) roughly population area Cook County, Illinois 10% cases Cook County - remembering Melbourne's outbreak occurred mid-winter considered absolute disaster locally. 


My personal theory biggest geographic factor sets Aus/NZ apart rest 'the West' (well, US/Canada) prevalence detached housing within urban areas. Less apartment living = less indoor communal spaces transmission occur households = effective lockdown. 


Being separated rest world water really huge factor 1) planes, 2) countries able control international borders (this obviously hard EU). say isolation benefit particularly unique Aus/NZ, moreso EU's economic integration hindrance situation. countries easily close off. Aus NZ closed world early maintained ban non-citizens entering - something Vietnam done similar success.


Seasonal geographic factors certainly play role, probably miniscule compared actual response implemented public health authorities - early response, international border closures non-citizens, mandatory hotel quarantine returning citizens, internal state border closures Australia, locking daily cases single digits, readily available testing, contract tracing, consistent public health messaging, etc. Australia NZ let things go, particularly Victoria's second wave (as *some* would us do), we'd much worse position. random slightest. direct inverse correlation lockdowns, mask wearing, testing tracing, social distancing avoiding gathering others indoors, number infections. former, smaller latter number. 

What absolutely maddening known start, yet keep pretending true, keep trying open up, keep trying get away wearing masks, keep trying find excuses justify reckless behavior endangers others. act exploding numbers sort unfortunate, unpredictable development. mean...no shit. going though? can’t legally enforce lot regulations want put people. literally word word website bud. Go read yourself. Wasnt happened spanish flu? Enough people either got died became immune stopped spreading? Yes.

And abstract. Here's full remains determined robust memory cell response absence detectable circulating antibodies protect SARS-CoV-2

Anyway, keep trying go personally. done. Honey get claymores!!! Yes, that’s word people live Utah. guess original term “Utahans” say loud second “a” barely audible dropped Watch fast declines Biden wins. That's actually really cool idea. I'm concerned kids actually trick treat without close quarters other. least people making effort. live, happens huge tourist destination, people going life usual, almost one wearing mask, retail stores participating annual trick treating events usually draw 40,000 kids town. Seriously tho, I'm sick ""Sheriff Shitkicker loves taste Trump's cock, enforce mandate, let's throw hands air cause there's nothing do"" 

Since okay country law enforcement choose laws enforce?

Granted, I'm familiar law enforcement chain command, pretty sure chain command still exists.

If sheriff Shitkicker refuses enforce laws, whoever sheriff Shitkicker needs throw ass. ass throwings need continue chain command shit gets done. Simple that. Dude, *literally* people months. people still getting it.

This **not** way. Deaths always trended following spikes.

Then sarcastically say ""tWo WeEkS"" go silent. You’re completely brushing fact even don’t die virus likely health issues resulting it. point need avoid catching first place, avoid dying it.

This way comparable flu, can’t believe people *still* making argument.

And yes, % population I’m willing sacrifice 0%. I’m compassionate parents &amp; grandparents, makes “middle schooler” fine, least I’m selfish asshole. know meant gotcha point still lack testing compared US Western countries. US media drums fear explosive CNN graphics saying Coronavirus cases exploding everyone mother goes get tested. Since covid-19 present like sniffles headache even asymptomatic positive cases (alongside false positives). 

As lack deaths, Japanese obesity rate 3% US nearly 40%. lumbering young people actually requiring ICU beds sad. mention Japanese mask FEEL SICK reduces transmission. USA stand 2nd place!!!

jk. god please help world right now. dont see two connected. That's also sizable amount people going get sick going get tested, deaths counted weeks come.  Big true people die covid die complications. 100 year old failing heart getting covid die covid going die heart failure wonder one hospital going mark cause death as? early voted Atlanta “clean” “dirty” pen cups identity verification. use touch screen fill ballot ug shit show peer reviewed?

You explicitly asked hear europeans!! reason answered, seriously. ""Well, asked..."", wrote.  you’re anti-gun, two minute ad Americans losing rights legal things like owning possess firearms you’re going deny people simply you’re it. 

This sentence make sense. middle part : "" *a two minute ad Americans losing rights legal things like owning possess firearms*"" there? remove make sense.

And yes want deny people guns it. way want deny people right steal cars, commit burglaries sell heroin, stop people creating laws possessing owning active among items activities find offensive. 

If majority elected parliament wants create laws, it. democracy works. thieves right steal stuff. seem dismiss countries traditions seem uphold God-given powers select group people. 

Did even read wrote?? can...how ?!?

You're problem made little theory europeans monarchies, compares guns religions USA, think clever. can't let go it, even nothing write fits idea all. point Americans don’t care president irresponsible. act science pandemic denier, put people risk end.... one cares. huge population support President trump re-election despite actions. Americans don’t care leader puts us risk, mocks mask wearing denounces science. cares people love Trump could run president 2024 loses year. law says (generally) two terms, don’t consecutive. 

Knowing much narcissistic asshole is, doesn’t flee country hide Russia, start campaigning coming back 2024 like cockroach won’t go away. West declines China anything steal, polish.

Oh.My.God. really paid close attention China, you?  Yeah anti COVID-19 protests tho appreciate trying bring nuance conversation, dude implied we're going need 5 years sterilizing vaccine college students hug grandmas. I'm sorry that's insane.

Also, manage vaccinate significant portion vulnerable population every year flu, time different? Thank &lt;3 that's I'm hoping luck. Murica! think - government surpressing information holding rallies spread virus. I'm afraid data America I'd trust sewage reports - show rising infection rates. 

You nowhere near ""turning corner"", heading fast disaster. 

I tired warn American acquaintances stay away Republicans listen president paid attention. LOL right! COVID isn’t one thing take risk with. Trump keeps rallying 10,000 people every day, multiple times day 

Keep wearing mask, stay afraid big bad china flu *""If first, last.""* Yeah, people don’t need didn’t need first time either. Please don’t sow panic. made everything unnecessarily much worse first go round. People need wear masks conscious activities. *don’t* need extra toilet paper. “different point view” actively results needless deaths hundreds disease could abated proper procedure, kind deserve ridiculed hated. likely caused tens thousands mindless students who've allowed run around cities drunk control. I've seen every night week city pissed eyes cavorting one another mask sight. Surprise surprise Covid cases went roof matter days. Australia pretty strict one Everything wanted comment would considered political *sigh*, pretty beastly zingers tho. 

So instead, propose legal one. Could organizers anyone bouncing totem pole deflected responsibility made legally culpable infections, damages result thereof, deaths? (As perhaps result following local/state guidelines pertaining respective locality) crowded all, everyone seems distancing, 100% people facemasks everyone disinfect hands. way likely catch supermarket there. fair protests full swing think everyone expected lead spike. I’m glad didn’t though. Ah that's crazy friend believes though vaccine sterilize people get vaccine social outcasts able get jobs perfect plan depopulate earth! worse virus possibilities. predators. prepared all. really need breakthrough anti viral. Yeah, bad Europe. Lets talk turkey day see gets crowned worst. Tough beat Belgium right now. need try America first. agree. However; lockdowns don’t work. 

Like that’s it. discussion. work island countries countries like China reasons already explained. pre-existing advantages made lockdowns successful. 

We, west; don’t run societies ant farm mindset. prioritize personal liberty freedom. lockdown really enforceable point eradicating virus. logic, countries stuck indefinite cycle freedom/lockdown devastating, exhausting frankly: working. 

So agree, something needed done lot earlier, methodology people use compare East Asian strategies west really comparable. Good! accept nonsense! Congratulations official mental gymnast. point literacy take ""when restrictions more, longer need make consideration covid"".

5yrs seems optimistic me, I'd expect effect health department recommendations hospitality industry decade absolute minimum.

Without clarification specifying terms, waste time discussing anyone may may meant. Omg, scary. website says absolutely nothing. looks like politician wrote themselves. absolutely details. honestly scary someone could leader put there. one number, one figure, whole page. Nothing amount money would use. shows taken time even sit think going do. page basically says ""hey guys, going good stuff pandemic"". really says. really can't believe put there. show anything new would do. really people may running country free time? looks like made 6th grader running class president. ""I'm going make school much better. get pizza everyday, free snacks, less homework!"" can't people go detail? any. going less happening now. Man scary people trying get power. also shows put position going win. Still, sad job attracts. think that's pretty clear Hey counter study let's see it.

But makes sense, protesters outdoors wearing PPE. Everyone else stayed home. concern h1n1 could bad phenotype often serious. produced extra vaccine..it little worse usual super bad. jobs, think great way slash police budget, then. Well, yeah. That's kind thing, causes worth fighting for. Unfortunately, believe either events yield enough change save lives events would take, say one fighting save lives future, much. southern hemisphere entering summer, shit Australia new Zealand would reopening anyways.

That said, Australia tremendous job locking down. family lives though (Melbourne) absolutely hated fact lockdowns strict. Could I’m 40 IQ smoothbrain whose adamant refusal mask wearing social distancing greatly increased chances getting infected dying covid?

No, it’s massive costly orchestrated plan order solely distribute deadly disease people right keeping leftists immune.

My god people obtuse Really see voting do. Neoliberal Dems shutting things back either. large part stimulus direct result Dems/Nancy. Voting fine whatever, help situation. US 300k excess deaths year 

so covid hell causing deaths?  Mine even heated seat. Ugh. hometown :( I’m gonna pretend didn’t say actually mean 

Theres way compared polio covid Countries EU locking yea failing worse USA

At least Europe tries prevent bad situation become worst. ironical second lockdown needed (we learn shit first simply hoped virus would magically go away), least done.
Instead of, know, letting virus going rampage without even fighting it. took exactly 1 hour joining line certificate hand expected related COVID-19. Vitamin deficiency global public health issue. 1 billion people worldwide vitamin deficiency, 50% population vitamin insufficiency.[1] prevalence patients vitamin deficiency highest elderly, obese patients, nursing home residents, hospitalized patients. prevalence vitamin deficiency 35% higher obese subjects irrespective latitude age.[7] United States, 50% 60% nursing home residents hospitalized patients vitamin deficiency. mean should. ONE kid tested NEGATIVE made happen. fact alone enough stop people. TON things lol. think easy say Australia isolate, look detail Australia - particular states (which huge land borders - Western Australia example second largest country sub-division world, assume larger European countries American states - Australia pretty much size mainland USA, WA one third Australia). 

Within Australia, states closed borders, Victoria state second wave, peaking 700+ new daily cases 30th July (it zero new cases today). Victoria locked Melbourne city, heavy restrictions, 99% people followed. mandated masks state wide, Melbourne curfew resticted movement (no 5kms home), closed specific industries, restrictions tailored industries. Melbourne residents allowed leave Melbourne, without valid reason, like working regional Vic. There's much detail list here. 

During time period, NSW state peaked 22 new daily cases, community spread cases (most NSW cases come overseas returns, isolated immediately), states less. Western Australia community spread cases since April. states land borders deal with, except Tasmania, managed stop virus spreading Victoria. Victoria accounts around 20k Australia's 27k cases, approx 800 900 deaths. Perhaps helped borders closed Victoria, state choice bring virus control, states would remain closed.

Are European countries American states closing borders? not, not? 330,000,000 ; population United States.
9,120,000 ; COVID cases far.

320,880,000 people haven’t COVID far. Even 250,000 cases per day would take 3 half years everyone contracted COVID. vaccine widely available next summer That’s DeSantis fired epidemiologist refused lie started manipulate numbers, assuming people would continue vacation they’re not. Put quotes then? Part family already politics. stops trying get one stand term? modeling ridiculously wrong UK long time now. agree you. fancy college words nobody could possibly understand.  Plenty answers you, smart guy. Try learning Reddit works read them. 🙄 I’m actually French national lived 16 years. They’re morons think like. even before? People believe virus hoax, candy-ass liberals get it, whatever bullshit believe. believe wearing mask assault ""freedom.""

I feel badly healthcare workers sure, honestly utterly given last fuck rest assholes. Stopping internal flight insisting international flights continuing flawed decision matter look it. 

Also, initial reaction... lied. covered up. censored reprimanded doctors. expert impressed this. think social equality political issue you’re already lost cause. respond comment above...I don’t know anything mass vigil RBG. happened, that’s something heard can’t really comment it. I’d assume still probably event holding rally inside months June July.  WhAtAbOuTiSm

Trump 2020 Title specify one five Americans Polio higher survival rate Covid-19.

Are going suggest people overreacted polio? That's true. Thanks reply. might sleeping good didnt cross mind.  protests? result take it. dont understand people dont get bad still. imagine last another one hundred years virulence death rate? bet thought UN incompetent organization world people believe power this? Actually worked. one google search away. lots camps right precautions zero (with z) cases. takes science adults room. need beat virus exactly government tells do, obviously oppressive governments going head start capability. dictatorship good 99 percent situations. Gotta look bigger picture. family lives Bozeman saw Facebook collage wedding without mask sight. fucked. protests summer due virus (though support fighting for). people protesting government make decision result countrymen dying. protests different reason. However acknowledge seems outdoor protests somewhat unlikely transmission vehicle. one brought education think lucky enough take right measures things could've gone bad (international &amp; interstate border closure). proper, competent (state) government backed supportive population makes easy handle situation. Masks don’t work though lol  They're busy trying stop hacking elections (and Russia STILL managed get hold voter information). wait turn around find Russia's gonna shut power grid shit. article makes solid case usefulness poop surveillance, reminds ""At time, point estimates community infection based wastewater measurements used,"" CDC advises.

The CDC advises, huh? Advise what, exactly? Maybe rename CDP.. Center Disease Promotion... Ikr, see start pandemic chart Italy's rate infection similar UK's. people can't absorb, take supplement Whataboutism finest right here. That's strange.

I Berlin Summer biggest anti-lockdown demos world going on. real spikes cases afterwards. people say outdoors. criticize strategy would result (700) fewer votes candidate. Well I've Oakland SF. handful masked socially distanced I'm confused. I'm even Trump fan comments anti Trump. echo chamber. LOVE trash people different points views. Smh. Lmfao forgot you’re leftist you’re actually mentally ill enough believe 

Leftists believe ANYTHING

Its gonna great four years tears  Thrillseekers. celebrated grandfather's 90th birthday. Diagnosed. Died alone. devastating hard knowing unique situation. I'm curious ages info like matters. get covid flu year want unnecessarily stress assume I'm screwed that's case. I'm advocating spreading virus careless people's lives all. Let know comments said anything like that.  we’re turning lights hiding ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ think Thanksgiving partner (same household). love tradition it’s worth year.

I don’t understand people can’t make sacrifice break tradition ONE stinking year slow spread pandemic. really shouldn’t hard. come big family and, least Christmas, usually multiple houses/events go every day 3-5 days, we’ll sometimes 30 family members one house. Nope. wait. 36 officialx5=180 million real Ahh back stocks actually seemed semi match reality least day day news cycle basis, even valuation already lofty Covid due Fed suppressing interest rates 10 years. Birx reportedly travelled 20,000 miles visited 40 states since August, conducting meetings local health officials advise combat pandemic.

She personally went consultation local officials combat virus. commendable Good new n bad news. 

Bad news, cases up

Good news, less people dying.

You choice whether sky falling, acorn playing hot potato study now? Oh much time got?

Your conspiracy theory basis reality averaged next 14 days, would 2.7% population common heuristic estimating currently active cases. that's people tested. Nah what's worse ignoring virus that's also killing well 

They've truly taken approach putting fingers ears going ""lalalala listening"" colleagues get die realize PCR tests EXTREMELY high false positive rates, right? testing method's Nobel prize winning inventor stated meant diagnostics.. maybe that's point.. last four years, I've taken absolute de-humanization approach them. waste time argue try change minds, I'll spit facts dip. upsets I'll take win. We're talking scum earth least opinion. Yep. don’t think reopening stuff directly contributed much spike cases much *mindset* reopening things makes people feel like it’s serious anymore. It’s people going friends houses family parties wearing masks don’t FEEL it’s serious threat anymore, think serious surely wouldn’t reopening everything! People don’t realize precautions still need taken seriously, even family friends. there’s people “over it” don’t care anymore they’re tired living life way, science covid-deniers. Mix up, it’s recipe absolute disaster. wonder numbers high.

I seen many people big groups together parties, traveling Vegas, going to/having larger weddings, even renting house cabin tons people one wearing mask. think people “over it” bad covid-deniers. They’re exact things different reasons. one saying easy, saying is, necessary. friend works NYU Langone BK. definstely stressed patients arrived sick, too.

where post cite from?

If want see black white, go ahead. read article experience bit nuance. I’m defending anyone anything, increasingly clear play East=good &amp; West=bad. Don’t agree?

East asian countries done great job tracing isolation many things, already valuable experiences infectious diseases last 20 years. We're hanging giant spider web today full size candy bars interspersed throughout kids come grab something crowd together. want bunch little pieces candy want linger web grabbing bunch pieces candy. half-term usually chilling resting. kids get bored want start stuff one week off. What. The. Fuck. Well that's came from, deny that? sure hope so. said gave shot two twins epileptic episode. she’s careful incident. government let minorities women vote, property, drink water fountains white men, freaked decided halt progress. anyone post actually caught covid-19? Adults, kids? bathroom sanctuary can't even imagine day &lt; 10,000 cases. Sadly see people walking around face shields regularly. always smug look face like figured best loophole world. thing is, ""pro-lockdowners"" may caricature, anti maskers categorically objectively wrong real.

Comparing caricature real-life type person creates debate one. fucking stupid be. Holy mother shit dude, wrong you. brain work? loosely populated dozens even hundreds people going houses one another. ever trickortreating majorly populated area? fucking nightmare.  almost definitely is. gene variant thought risk factor (one many possible) severe COVID. One many isn’t thought effect infection rate. possibly seriousness. lower infection rates almost certainly due different measures. Protests started last week. connections yet covid cases. weddings, schools churches name current cases. Strop bullshiting. Clearly protests began time cases started ramping massively Poland. almost mindlessly regurgitating shite heard TVP... Yup strawman. Like saying people pro-abortion. That’s fantastic. think trouble finding volunteers here. people organize exposed many people per day hope stay healthy. didn’t get opinion defending west’s response, think pointing there’s likely biological factors play well. No.
There also party 50 people 26 got covid. 
And one them, getting fine, attacked bystander. issues hope find peace life. said wont find talking me. back account creation mate I’m wondering capitalist troll trying make capitalism look better espousing leftist propaganda designed prop capitalism. I’ve seen many people like online. seem post around time. I’ve read exact post multiple times reddit. ""If get it, going get better,"" Trump, contracted disease earlier month, told crowd supporters Waterford Township, Mich., Friday. ""Then going immune, whole thing, goes away."" Yea looked after. ppl dont even know justify existence Wait people giving alcohol covered candy? best adult Halloween ever! ""Berufsschule"" (vocational college) hygiene concept literally consists wearing masks. 1.5m distance recommended, mandatory wear mask get closer classmates long classroom.

To top off, surface disinfectant recommended school, school likely get disinfected all. toilets pretty dirty soap far. Apparently soap onwards, soap help toilets full germs they're properly cleaned... least, school building two times. crazy! I'm Indiana ik multiple friends family members gotten exposed tests pretty expensive often afford take test. Meanwhile DC get free Covid test every week felt like it. Facts links? Otherwise, I'm afraid, full shit Oh god forgot that. 
That cringe, also bit terrifying. Leave news couple weeks. Vote mask goggles. Wear masks go out. *need* maintain daily exposure depressing news gets worse keep behaving safely plan sitting porch costume, masked gloved, throwing candy kids distance. Throwing things kids, safe distances, still celebrating. Win-win all! mostly boils white leadership hmmm I'm sure glad trump ended pandemic! Worldwide cases recorded yesterday +573,616 , theres good chance future could see 1 million cases day.

Although believe could million day already, arent recorded. circling drain.  person said NY, still lower April numbers now. Part problem much country ignored NYs peak. getting covid. stopping testing shit (no pun intended) problem vanishes, right? According experts surrounding trump really. 90% population three cities.

We paid stay home, selfish enough think didn’t affect us. bad breath smell shit spit out? know exactly wtf happened today everyone else world. Brush teeth go read book...fuck president congress willing pay Americans stay home couple weeks month cost financial help would absolutely dwarfed cost human lives financial hit we're going take virus remains unchecked. also value straight face standing behind injecting bleach light bulb anus.

This giving credit deserve wish would Ireland right now. 6 week lockdown go like 3 miles house limit essential trips exercise. They’ll reevaluate 6 weeks. I’d rather wait couple months intense lockdown able go next year continue game go first sign positive trend create another surge. I'm sure frozen food aisle local grocery open. hope people change behaviors. Cases slowly rising county, lot friends family calling Thansgiving already. got hit moderately hard spring. Im hopeful people learned first surge. Human behavior huge drivinf force spread Denmark trying general mask requirements inside public place source this?

What think total hospitalization rates (what percentage people get hospitalized)? Germany. Half way competent leader. Still got issues. nearly bad, seems like they're something. imagine German right feel nearly dark/apocalyptic. I'm UK. we're governing pr. See people feel damned thing acting. frustrating. Oceanic Asian countries like mine prepared lot since SARS. also deal pay vaccinations various diseases pacific brothers. bothers see many “developed” countries call us ass end world yet discovered literal vaccines prevent cancer (HPV). 

We nipped SARS, Hendra, Brisbane variant influenza, HPV, efficiently gave humanitarian aid let others same. things work actually try Oh irresponsible top action film, dare low water use toilets Trump whines about. need flush . it’s brand new virus, even eradicated today, 80% people who’ve go heart lung issues probably reducing life span causing lots health problems.

REALLY want go Applebee’s? spiking bad right now. Fall vaction over, schools reopend... 20.000+ new daily cases. (equiv. 80.000 US) catching up...

I case home right PITA reach official hotline example... (I assume positive since spend 7h car patient) could also learn experience, practice. Perhaps things people weigh differently you. makes us fucked people don’t attempt moderate views taking account others views things different set values ik /s, what's go-to counter point that? tests cause disease? Plus schools work places shops still open, wont make difference cases stay open. Yup, diagnosed positive yesterday. 43 years old, CKD complication. Constant headache, tired hell. Contact tracing local health dept. underway. Mask up, everybody. I'm idiot, that's I'm situation. step son's high school already announced going remote Thanksgiving January. much risk people travel see family let back together good paper mid October estimated infection fatality rate. It’s line (and may source) 0.4% number user said. 

So it’s good IFR lower, course still concerning you’re slowing spread. thing glean west’s response pain shutting worth gains. might suggest “east” must value it’s vulnerable more. propose alternative reasoning heavy hands response Asia. don’t believe China cares elderly west does. don’t believe second. record human rights garbage would happily sacrifice weakest among best interest. fear believe virus harmful healthy individuals west does. Harmful enough lose lot ground US terms economic growth. Scary think virus escaped lab. lowered travel alerts infectious diseases Australia, South Korea, Singapore, Thailand, Taiwan, China, New Zealand, Brunei **Vietnam**

What's point this? thought Vietnam allowing travel anywhere, even returning citizens. I'll clean house living fear, least least sanitary. mean, Obama 9/11 needed him? That's scary. thought improvements medical capacity treatment made death rate decrease, wow maybe fluctuate flu season. Healthcare worker nursing home here!
My heart breaks you... it’s tough situation.
But want make sure know alone, workers wouldn’t expect take time lonely resident. They’re family ❤️
Sending love warm thoughts!   round corner. late autumn winter months, April September? True. Illinois experiencing surge. one party running courts stop life saving measures like mask mandates. One party plotting kill governors. One party going courts prevent legitimate votes counted election. John Osterholm, lord virology, said April 480,000 dead little stop it. going exactly predicted. Blame everyone want. Doesn’t matter. Humidity definitely makes indoor air less infectious grocery shopping rainy days. bonus also empty days since one wants go rainy days.

Win win! Guilt-based society vs Shame-based society.

Guilt useless pandemic damage apparent immediately. Sure, people feel guilty getting someone else sick late.

In Asian countries, nail sticks gets hammer. person wearing mask parties friends, that's huge loss face. ""If one person ill COVID-19, easily spread everyone housing unit,"" health official said. ""And nature summer camp eat meals together, go swimming together, activities together, sing around campfire together—all activities great spreading events."" Put way, camp—which CDC identify—does sound like trouble pandemic. ""That's would go one person 100 people short period time,"" said, per Journal Sentinel. Aug. 11, CDC said, everyone camp cleared travel back home. Campers staff members come 21 states territories two countries. yet, whats point? low mortality rate atm almost everyone way higher mortality rate. 


Everyone hating us ni lo lockdown death toll people eating death? forget word “pro-lockdown” , author continues explaining meaning curtain-twitching vigilantes *obsessed rising case numbers exclusion every metric.*

That’s “real” group even it’s narrow dishonest characterisation group. help workers well businesses. Eating restaurant means restaurant employ waiters, chefs, pot washes, manager. order takeout employ Chefs someone answer phone. less people working less money circulating 91 good life... probably prepared now. Ok makes sense. That's said confused point was. Guilt-based society vs Shame-based society.

Guilt useless pandemic damage apparent. Sure, people feel guilty getting someone else sick late.

In Asian countries, nail sticks gets hammer. person wearing mask parties friends, that's huge loss face. certain group people country pro-death. wild stab dark, another thing probably get prison! hope enjoying donuts top shelf grog mate! guys earned it! boys! Let's get 1m February!


But seriously though people treating incremental game Oh OK, 2 weeks wait nation collective number elevated...and isn’t anywhere offload patients. probably tough topic broach school setting ask people COVID isbt real, fuck extra peoole dying year? Show ne team scientists government officials whi working 24/7 trying find ""real"" reason extra people dying *obviously* COVID... number people dying normally expect COVID suddenly large proportion could start believe conspiracy theory basically new deaths besides small number lives saved new health consciousness helped also spread potentially fatal diseases like flu. know downvoted, sub famous inconsistency yeah first Thanksgiving/Christmas I've looked entire adult life. can't waist year, make far. part every single Western country Northern hemisphere playing conspiracy, tanking economies, social stability, political popularity filling hospitals so?

Is start respiratory viral spread season happens every year also conspiracy hundreds years making, designed shadowy powers epidemiologically widely predictable moment?

The numbers higher election. deaths Europe much higher month worse April (although cases may turn corner due many lockdowns bring instituted now) still find way spin without ever considering reflecting whether misjudged anything, believing increased spread novel widely seeded respiratorily spread virus heading November must entirely local parochial political obsessions might obviously foolish.

Remind four weeks. Yeah would say 30% adamantly anti masks/Covid mitigation etc.  know plenty still mask concerns Covid.  paradoxically believe he’s done could chalk rhetoric Covid trump running mouth Trump. Im planning going cruise July 2021. vaccine prevalent testing common avg person able buy one CVS $5. vaccinated lets hop boat!!!!

Hopefully Biden opened Cuba back again, place cant wait cruise again, Bermuda. dont give shit jab bro lets go!!

Washy washy!!!!!🤲 Exactly, colleague 40°C fever coughing around late February/early March. tested country considered hotspot come contact known case. Unless see meaningful action - either restrictive mandates substantial changes public behavior - yes, growth continue.

It’s like Fire...it’s going keep burning work put out. love lack awareness focused someone never heard Trump Jr. active misinformation tour. 

Hunter hasn’t effected life, Donnies rally raised cases may shut local school yeah, hunter crack. Best world I’m sorry rude tone, come resistent facts. Saying ”It almost certainly is” indicated either didnt read took seriously.

I understand add another layer complexity can’t expected get right fight covid. 

No, it’s infection rates, say severity. disease severity likely correlated infectiousness, valuable step towards understanding principal uncertainties regards means COVID-19 transmitted, special regard factors may accelerate delay spread, mode transmission, role asymptomatic infected people, speed, possible interactions wildlife livestock, urban rural environments population know tough happens think got live long life instead dying young age. exponential corner, pointing ☝️ Stfu None items shut worlds economy bunch pussies afraid getting flu. terrible try Definitely kushner. words Curly Bill - ""Well...bye"" It’s like 40%. wouldn’t say 40% half, still absurdly large number people. Imagine much government declared end pandemic. /s Im southern hemisphere different thank :p True least there’s kind unified effort federal government maybe enforce mask mandate like sane countries did. We’re gonna lock down. People businesses wouldnt accept it. hardly accepted first one. fear largely gone people care economic impacts Don’t worry, getting vaccines Election Day I’m another lockdown U.S economy weak, would love vacation work, they’ll probably figure way make essential employee won’t anything prevent spread coworkers. sucks. hope works you.

I good solution. Obviously leads problems kids staying home many months too. wife blood

Sister cousin? Yes point government passes lasting stimulus fully lock down. Mr. Burns theory Simpsons sorta? response ongoing public health emergency, American researchers developed interactive web-based dashboard (static snapshot shown above) hosted Center Systems Science Engineering (CSSE) Johns Hopkins University, visualize track reported cases real-time.  Asian guy here:

* like freedoms much do
* like locked cages guard throws food floor lunch dinner
* temporary inconvenience give us permanent freedom opt temporary inconvenience
* unlike countries want permanent inconvenience temporary freedoms year we'll learn tat's exactly covis does. people power always use fear situations take control population, conspiracy facts UK lockdown one name - allowed go shops, exercise outside etc. US much better shape Europe, almost every Euro country much higher rate infection US moment never said understand. said original poster said ""real wedding"" later, understand moving wedding zoom easy moving bar mitzvah planned pre pandemic. situation sucks everyone. I'm sure frustrated April people said ""just close business reopen pandemic"". easy business owner situation. Taiwan democracy far know. might confusing chinas government. countrys like South Korea Israel able flatten second wave quikly authoritarian well. declaring scientist another hunch have? I’ll answer you. Generally, tract outbreaks near anywhere people gather. wasn’t difficult triangulate determine community spread due protests. Hospitals testing sites keep data. Also vaccination rates 2.5x higher regular years. sure flu cases reported covid deaths, even then, difference minor. mention plenty covid cases going unreported well Fauci recently mentioned herd immunity would require 60-70% population infected. That's millions dead. 

*If* really option, spread long period possible, there's way hospitals could keep up, even magic doctors nurses hospital personal immune. 

And there's possibility antibodies hold. 

I truly see option outside total lockdown 2 months so. need reset. ruin economy? Undoubtedly. ruin less year death, think so. Yes Europe shows well...either go zero, keep measures afterwards. milestone. things make headlines. Canada released news us hitting 10000 total deaths. 

It's meaningless. numbers arbitrary. focus actual impact covid us. London, response full Hazmat: Birmingham, man collapsed died outside coronavirus testing center: people dont Covid.

If tested Covid would much bigger stories them.

Or think someone wouldnt tested Covid drop street middle Covid pandemic? I'll quote Idaho health board member show true.

""Something's making people sick, I'm pretty sure coronavirus, question asking is, 'What's making sick?'"" testing comes confirmed cases. death rate extremely low people need stop acting like bubonic plague. Ive personally tell say immunocompromised, big deal anti-vax one conspiracy theory seems popular women men Men disproportionately died it. dumb. that's right. 1 nurse every 12 patients ideal standard care.  There's reason going extinct. 

A product time long dead.

And good fucking riddence.. Yet another clear sign evolved modern homo sapiens quite yet... graduate 3rd grade get cdc?

Let's come new acronym meanings cdc... Seems low. Polls showing 40% US nearly bad Europe, Belgium today reporting US equivalent 562,000 cases, Poland 190,503,Netherlands 190,198,Austria 196,308, Hungary 133,654, there's many Euro countries even reported yet today  feel free present evidence support point. Nope. goal implement lock number recoveries higher number new cases 3-4 weeks. takes work going happen instantly. I've staying inside home since March hate fact I've done vain small minority idiots country decided whatever want want get much politics mods really like removing posts yes US right wing media definitely impacts world opinion negatively. Many Canadians people countries listen/read right wing media US daily.

So means lot people anti masks Covid hoaxers anti vaccine US.  call protest, they'd immortal Except get rid Corona competent administration educated populace. USA severely lacking, leading current state nation. Imagine virus mutates becomes seasonal pandemic kills 400,000 Americans year... Xi Jingpin master plan worked /s still don’t answer riots protest still ongoing decline mean West unwittingly entered race bottom China, yes economic dominance ended. However, decline overall innovation human progress. 

As last race West Soviet Union shows, totalitarianism abysmally poor innovation human progress. Sure totalitarian regimes use brute force state whip human beasts burden focus one industry goal, continually polish turd, rarely come anything new. West declines China anything steal, polish. 

Ultimately freedom expression association intrinsically linked innovation, China wants succeed West, ""steal"" too, spark Enlightenment defines West endure. Especially conservative pundits amplify message. Dennis Prager still arguing masks ineffective people wear scared idiots. Well...f*** Lol, like crowded bars clubs better. That’s exactly said.

Adults don’t call things don’t like “fake news.” Republicans that. Bill Melinda Gates seem legitimately good people care humanity whole, mostly, yeah. Woohoo!! Well done guys. Great job!! mean wasn’t competition like, I’m glad you’re giving all! Xx herd immunity. were, come Measles far infectious covid never ""burn out"" own? farse. Pretty lame depopulation tool seeing mostly kills people beyond child-making age That’s worth 

How hasn’t mental health toll made go outside yet giving us much credit. Baboons least basic survival instincts. Lots testing! Things opening up, bound happen.

I think that's saying unclear. going it? Absolutely nothing! We'll vote party next time, complain they've screwed us, vote again

Repeat thing happened aunt. Thinking family right now. Flatten curve, like one march Also, ou suggesting US shouldnt holding elections?

Not all, elections means lot movement, potential clusters.

Korea prepared team case ever happens. actually, entirely, objectively false. number tests determine number cases. truth whatsoever statement. conservative friends board trump called hoax.  call changed tunes said flu. *Breathes lollies*
*Hands lollies mini incubator*
Profit! big protests right due ruling abortion. Likely going help situation. ever think people ideas life do? Like morals scientific curiosity... really going trust guys inject kids products place get takeout lot lady call ask get food. worker told order online, come order take out, get delivery. 

She responded, ok great, I've got covid I'm supposed quarantined, know would different.

They told would put ground outside. today marks sabbath sir, point clearly holds days. keep asking over, many different threads someone says said.... actual evidence B T-cells without antibodies enough prevent reinfections COVID. 

Nobody give real evidence. 

Meanwhile, see comments like (which, idea whether following true viral media blowing proportion. every aspect immune system equally effective preventing getting reinfected. Circulating neutralizing antibodies important preventing reinfection fact disappointing news seems like aren’t going particularly long cells helpful clearing virus faster second time around, won’t keep getting infected entirely.

I'm trying get actual evidence this, ask, get return ""that's is"", evidence.  ಠ_ಠ deaths spiking, everybody could predict time ago. ""That guy"" responsible new deaths.

E.g. Germany:

[http://7eggert.selfhost.bz/images/Corona/](http://7eggert.selfhost.bz/images/Corona/)

(Have mercy DLS line, please mirror instead linking) exactly vaccine does. absolutely primes immune system. 
""In general, first dose produce protective immunity, “primes” the immune system. protective immune response develops second third dose""
Literally right CDC. Wait Halloween fallout hits one two weeks...

Trick treat! Cases/testing good, deaths bad. masks bunched together rally yelling. also comprised people never wear masks therefore likely bring virus them. point need science again, mouth breather. think confusing Taiwan China: yet president still claiming pandemic ending making fun virus, schlubs still voting him... I’m sure would reveal chronic condition actor (especially big star), hoping get cast something next year, I’m sure would reveal chronic condition made working hard. imagine trying make movie someone often breath? Canceling shoots cost significant chunks money.

So think would better actor hid problems, got part, people find chronic long-term Covid believe not, people private blast life social media.

Celebrities Covid? Time move Scotland then! Thankfully current polls show don’t support him. No, helps citizens actually run competent governments dismiss scientists epidemiologists. know wear fucking masks properly. isn’t “either or” situation. we’re asking make collective effort vaccine comes, least better understanding disease treatment. 
I’m sick &amp; tired people okay sacrificing percentage population name *their* freedom. freedom people die painful death? Raping. dolphins do. Man, gotta stop saying everything record, cause I’m excited try break it. Got thanks! tornado warnings Amber alerts me. bad possible disable presidential alerts. wanted disable bad turned phone completely expecting test little back. want showing phone. problem leaders America bunch incompetent baboons. 

And US filled monkeys willing jump trees land heads, means ""triggering"" side. ban body check still call hockey? figured troll chose engage anyway. least *know* troll. Fuck u ur lockdowns User name checks out. Seriously wanna see fucking hang careful telling truth here, gonna get banned soon End lockdowns...it’s seriously bankrupting everyone. Unless give us sort stimulus like Australia - give $$$ every month staying home, don’t want hear it! mean, one two groups believe masks help pandemic.

The crowding spaces without masks like sort roman hate orgy. Imagine actually linking source, yet *still* understanding says.

I continually amazed see people cite data way, hundreds interactions online, first person I've seen actually link correct source data, *yet still manage completely misunderstand it*.

This turn Internet. fake news problem. People actually read proper source still fail understand it. can't fix stupid. decrease population certainly slow growth. texas redlines soon expensive fly patients well families visit Trump still thinks it’s joke even half million dollar treatment. Current administration saying covid Protests great people scared get robbed, beaten, even killed them. Honestly start peacefully protesting everywhere maybe covid disappear!!? went get tested. experience: 

I went nearest testing site (my mum´s old elementary school). line went around quite bit, around 45 minutes inside building. waiting, everything orderly, distancing stuff.

Once inside turn, showed ID, gave number, cough blow nose tissue, stick shoved nose. big deal. Went outside 15 minutes later (negative!) test result.

Celebrated wine cat adoption.  gives much credit. think far ahead.  often think death illness underlying conditions? fucking idiot big country? Tawain? South Korea? 

AU/NZ sake argument, different story... Tweet available me. say? There's lot space two opposites. saying every politician New Zealand Vietnam (very successful handling covid) spent 2020 hiding basement?

When denigrate experts mock masks, invite disaster. Gotta use protection, dude. think pretty obvious it: basically set covid quarantine camps death wards put entire cities house arrest. Western democracy go far, places juntas regimes. remember China country strict controls inter-province travel/migration. farm hand rural outlying area can't pick &amp; move Shanghai. amazing! riots saved lives! 

There cases spread tens thousands people standing shoulder shoulder screaming yelling coughing fear gas. EVERY protester mask  never took even moment It’s bad Oklahoma. Why? thought masks matching biggest reasons didn’t cause outbreaks. think would different weren’t summer? right way, insidious. Prosperity theology equally bad. China well known transparent nature.

I thought comment stated active cases sars china? I'm telling you, is. Nope, so-called healthcare 'collapse' forecast happen many months ago US never did, US fine--No 'hard lockdowns' ever happen nationally(unless Biden goes nutso), state---look happening Italy Spain, rioting new lockdowns article:
""Methodology: calculated risk infection Covid-19 using tool developed José Luis Jiménez, atmospheric chemist University Colorado expert chemistry dynamics air particles. Scientists around world reviewed Estimator, based published methods data estimate importance different measurable factors involved infection scenario. However, Estimator’s accuracy limited relies numbers still uncertain – numbers describe, example, many infectious viruses emitted one infected person. Estimator assumes people practice two-meter social distancing rule one immune. calculation based default value general population, includes wide range masks (surgical cloth), loud voice, increases amount aerosols expelled."" think going likely scenario. Oh FFS. wondered would start that.  
First, think say ""the West"" less dominated Global stage military, economically, technologically culturally past 500 years. Now, would say two factors play result relative decline: One external (the rise Asia), one internal (active decline Western societies).

Externally: think question Asia rapidly catching partly even overtaking west terms economy technology. know thing ""economic center gravity""? basically ever moving eastwards. Military power always lacks behind economy technology, expect Asia draw West upcoming decades. true, world nuclear bombs military dominance kind complicated thing know enough dynamics make good judgement. Cultural dominance kind comes together dominating global stage general. matter time people poorer parts world stop dreaming american dream, start dreaming asian dream. maybe chinese one. always culture superpower influence rest. 


Internally: Now, also think West kind late roman empire type situation. One major problem collapse civil society west, prominently US also Europe. think need explain much keywords: Trump, political polarization, social media fake news, conspiracy theories, wealth inequality, balkanization society separate identity group's, etc. Basically, Western societies becoming even focused individual even less well society. want achieve something society, need certain amount homogeneity collectivism. Otherwise end society egoists. Germany got saying ""If everyone cares himself, everyone cared for"". reached toxic levels West. might biggest problem also major factor corona crisis management failed badly. [This posted couple days ago captures well think. 

I think text already long enough, another thing think west decline is, nutshell, society/government becomes inept. I'm Germany, Germany massive problems burocracy. Today actually opening day new Berlin airport. supposed open 10 years ago, delayed due burocratic incompetence. airport though. city building metro line 25 years still finished. meantime, Asia build metro network city millions time. could go on... 


And thing is, aspects West declining, asian nations much successful. societies eating up. still able build stuff without legion burocrats standing way. 


And even mention demographic change (aging society) yet hit Europe badly, extreme costs imposed climate change, fact economies powered endless amounts quantitative easing tons zombie companies. 



So yea, could go on, go arguments.


Edit: forgot mention long term planning next election period basically non existent west China make 40 year plans. Fair enough. need remember roughly 100 million people vote 2016 election know way they'll vote time. wont go Biden. Polls trusted. Polls showed Hillary winning good amount, know ended up. get complacent, I'm saying. Maybe get law passed election candidates pass background check hired employee equivalent security clearance would pass. eligible. current rate, would take 10 years infect entire US population. Indeed. mention rally, oddly enough, maybe he'd leave country lost..... much better treating disease March.  never good speller Masks prevent getting disease, spreading it. 25% whatever number call protests wearing masks, still standing shoulder shoulder screaming chanting, spreading disease.

Keep justifying murdering grandma though, probably republican anyways. basically, may infections gatherings - offset people staying home events? Interesting That’s anecdotal guy. Don’t put mental trap seeing local trends anecdotal evidence make broad strokes national trends Divide deaths Italian population tp get deaths per capita multiply US population. put past current administration. Like what? can't reach herd immunity naturally, vaccine can't either.

This wrong. long takes reach immunity. disease takes many years say birth cohort hit herd immunity levels, cohort susceptible. cycle continues. seen classic childhood viruses cyclical patterns outbreaks. Vaccination breaks cycle reducing naive population leading herd immunity prevention disease spread naive population young vaccination. Maybe false. What’s left wing wanting murdered? 

I believe lot masks worn outside. Plus lockdowns nobody going bars indoor places couldn’t afraid. thought deus ex game Gathering large numbers following precautions pandemic leads people getting sick dying???? way! know source yet, seen Kashgar border Central Asia I'm guessing came porous land border.

I believe source Urumqi outbreak ever found either. need ask think it’s absurd? 

Cases deaths doubling every 10-12 days month. Unless actions taken infection simply continue double every 10-12 days.

It’s relatively simple. person gives one person, exponentially increases. 

The reason U.K. didn’t see 4K deaths/day went lockdown research, see result. Would allow stock food stay home month work infected people crowd? think checking airflow. entire argument ignores part purpose lockdowns prevent catastrophic overflow hospital services, would economically socially devastating. 

We get hate lockdowns, take honest. right money. Tbh think time maybe late next year early 2022 we're kinda like ""oh yeah remember covid? long ago."" eradicated normalcy forced started like domino effect there's vaccine. see states jump headfirst everyone folloe. Oh that's good point well saying ""Are 75? Oh well bad dear, going suffocate pulmonary fluids die alone hospital corner. Sorry. go restaurant bar. Also taking kids Spain vacation."" Yeah you’re fearmongering sub Reddit, it’ll seem way. yet show I’m putting anyone risk. Peer reviewed notable. like story can't followed... Happy Halloween!!! protests? California begs differ. No, I’m saying high percentage wore masks, almost one Trump rallies.

I’m saying spread covid, I’m saying spread little. Less Trump rallies reopening restaurants.

God, sounds like great reason tear gas peaceful crowds, call nearest police chief tip. stop... ""Eloi Eloi lama sabachthani?""

men decided trinity hundreds years history christianity.  talk muslim friend - knows you. life even worth living plowing big tittied Mormon mil? Idk, maybe move third-world nation brutal communist state death like expected. defending faith, defending sexual predator. 

I'm sure person arrives point life contort truth defend someone uses position power authority take advantage women children.

Most humans would disgusted did, defend him. Says lot type people attracted Mormonism. 'think' it, know it, can't lockdown important country planet one largest countries Earth(But knows? Biden might nuts enough try January Democratic sweep victory next month, stay tuned  North Dakotan here. absolutely people caring want, still going bars, eat restaurants, still going church, weddings, baby showers, family reunions, name it. 

It nothing luck. Wait...the west failed? come east? think mental disorder. US politically split, way get enough people state follow order without calling military pretty. forget unlike countries, general public armed US Conspiracy theory people arise -- seems covid past, great argument federalization European Union.

And everyone vote it, since noone want experience covid times again. see 1 guy. run, likely running Prison. would make fantastic television. I'm sure admitting wrong count Florida recovering far better California, also nearly countries lockdown better recovery, either super low population density mobilize large amount people work free lockdowns, volunteer deliver food people’s houses lockdowns, that’s super tough work, one west work free much workload. know lockdown eradicate virus, lockdowns ever done, it’s delaying inevitable, like stupid macron, knows lockdown don’t eradicate virus curve spike reopen, still went ahead political show. It’s show idiots don’t understand basic statistics science trying something. weird first thought 30000 sounds like small number.  think people mean stop limiting effects daily lives. Hand sanitizers don't. Social distancing, masks, travel restrictions, ban mass events do. think cholera polio tbc, went centuries even day age still dumbass ""protests""? led infections right? u/talapark

u/temstar

Why new outbreaks happening China? thought everything control. BLACK LIVES MATTER know article, earlier (around April May) study published 40k patients Brazil. People flu shots associated lower probability death less symptoms.
Also 100% guaranteed thing, everything science, around 5-10%~ less
I try find paper interested study many cases deaths caused nationwide rioting protests? exactly kind biased non sense pushed voters elect Trump 2016. listed thread, plenty studies Google well.

Also, let's confuse riots protests. may yeah i'm NY there's absolutely zero reason panic buy again. hand sanitzer/tp/and paper towels plenty restocked months. suggesting every single protester mask? Cause start posting countless pictures otherwise. Also good mask coughing spitting tear gas? absolutely ridiculous suggest covid spread among hundreds thousands people across country shouted chanted shoulder shoulder. gave everyone $100,000 lockdown please explain would slowed virus? degree even related pandemic!

This shit could already could stop stupid.  Yes long quarantine two weeks called emergency alerts. thing can't disable alert president. Look option text message program Ya know, isn’t nuclear weapons chemical agents kill us whole, social media propensity species gobsmacking stupid. Wednesday is? world's top researchers infectious diseases American trained. international effort fight infectious diseases historically led funded America. MANY successful countries fighting covid based response teams America's E g e fly Yellow Flag Fun material portion country fed constant stream disinformation believes children effectively immune this. First I'm one responded earlier second matter authoritarian is, comparing little islands close bordering countries country 1/7 world population act like one skeptical reported numbers dumb. yes forget am. pretty much every health authority US. No, not.  Didn’t Kroger’s also stop paying “hazard pay” bonus employees months ago? Good job everyone making America great again. plan coup supporters sick? Pretty sure last thing Boris wants lockdown. He's facing devastation country economy either way. assume exposure whole group random dosis im talking controlled exposure little virus people develop little symptoms. good science already kill anyone

I assume this, one does. first point controlled exposure takes long, unless *many* asymptomatic people we're currently aware of. took us year hit 9 million total cases, we've put massive pressure health system economy; 70% US population 252 million people. maths: even controlled exposure 20 million year somehow (double now), would take us 10 years hit 200 million virus would mutate anyways).

I've actually studied this, ask anyone else has; herd immunity term never used type problem seem confuse antibodies immunity. blood loses antibodies time memory make lasts many years. 

This misconception, lose immunity time, even course best solution take least year reach herd immunity longer anti vaxxers. can't lock whole winter.

Herd immutiny necessary restart economy, need active working member require vaccines system much fragile imagine. civil war would kill many people people much different group virus.

The world countless hard times, including depressions, global wars, pandemics too. baffles people think can't adjust different lifestyle year vaccines developed. civilization fragile would become extinct long ago. see civil war happening, wealthy's benefits (disconsidering international meddling).

I know sucks, way, one, mean *no one*, knows anything highschool biology, tell same. I'm economist, solution, herd immunity cannot work. Close, it’s depopulation plan orchestrated Mother Nature. Oh know, you’re essential. Thank best. Ag tests hivh tendency false negatives though. Hope communicated folks EU extension US, failure handling pandemic something US take ownership of. Everything going great far, regular disinfection room, keeping safe distance, people disciplined, I'm proud Slovakia!! Ah yes. One things china famous for. well hidden rest world. Neighbor friends sent evite Halloween party house. Guest list hidden don’t know coming many invited. like...uh...we’re...busy. Well ok also condoms used diseases vaccines distributed throughout population. Masks still required go grocery store requirements go away time. Spring Break Floriduh me. much transmission flu season long over? Winter's fucked. started going beyond normal food storage preparations, glad did. went exact thing. Lost abuelo 2 years ago still feel guilty learning Spanish could speak him. 95 year old abuela passed 2 weeks ago Covid. Genuinely one hardest things I’ve ever gone through. death troll? wish somebody would show turn emergency alerts. phone, messages come silence button disabled. Hire staff COVID-19 survived probably mean much, hope get point. Stay safe. normal country would be, January can. stepson lives Missoula, we're CA, counties number cases since beginning month ago. 14 cases county 900+. terrifying quickly changed.  Pakistan high fertility rate average age 20 compared almost 30 India. Similar Africa. number cases pakistan 3 4 times less deaths due demographics alone. Even Karachi serosurveys showing 50% infection. Nick Cordero died. count long-term problem?  engineer virus would cause “depopulation” would attack old serious illnesses.

The way (hypothetically) would non-lethal virus causes sterility younger people. easy Haha people commented stupid hahaha /s

Truly shocking see naive us back then. Deaths 4 week delay. Whatever ratio cases today 4 weeks ago (lets say 20k now, 1k 4 weeks ago), expect see deaths. case 20x.

So 30 deaths, 600 per day 4 weeks.  reason walking around What’s point then? Sure, treatments everything deadly. novel virus treatment high mortality..... wear seatbelt guy. Thanks China mean places freedom people aren’t quick sacrifice it...even face pandemic kill many? places authoritarian rule much better total lockdowns? Shocking developments. Government suppression protests hilarious! USA, USA,USA #1. Yeah!!!! also curious results anyway, likely catch thousands infected people isolate immediately!! Protesters wearing masks socially distancing, **unlike Fuckface's stupid rallies.** So, no, already determined back summer protests barely caused rise cases. Rallies did. Rallies caused dad, present *is* healthcare worker, contract virus. 

This stupid take feel like idiot making it. make difference, cops problem blackface. Considering many people turn alerts off, never received angle, clearly see space them. People going groups safe distance them. Outside, masks wind enough make risk infection close 0. felt safe testing shopping groceries capital city. How. don’t want people die? leaders aren’t thinking holistically affects people everywhere. Makes sense. die lot faster gangrene covid really!!!!!! I’m trying imagine it. point sort vaccines, ia way related said. You’re right I’m sorry hear you’re going through. 

I think people forget (or never experience) it’s like sick. Summer 2019 actual flu. bad covid, two weeks thought, wow take feeling well granted. would almost anything feel normal again. 

I think lot people remember times sick, remember mild colds, medicine fixing them. It’s naive arrogant time. would held paying taxes. feel you..my kids 7 10, complained feel them. still remember fun Halloween running around friends trying grab much candy carry one night.

Watch Halloween scary movies them, pop popcorn, carve pumpkin, get candy etc. One year without trick treating sad get it. think cough right? ""chronic longterm issues"" people talk about. ££, despair clicks seems unfortunate motives media :( lol absolute nut job went bed, comment 3 times?

here I'll provide idiot ass example:

in masks effective article the New England Journal Medicine from May 2020 came conclusion cloth face masks offer little protection everyday life. (Source)

First see studies early pandemic, like study actually reading it, talking Healthcare workers saying wearing mask protect workers virus transmittable means. 

Which course true, saying mask help reduce transmittal need protect ways,but bigger thing ignores main point mask effectiveness, effective person virus mask on, less important protecting wearer, article even discussing. 

What's even convenient biased source lists ""masks effective"" studies way bottom provides OPINION studies flawed, provide reasons aside from, person person said so(which BTW find anecdotal counter points studies masks). 

So back new England Journal article, oh hey recent one actually discussing universal maskings effect pandemic limited look best ways protect Frontline Healthcare workers wait what? institution clearly supports masking recent article? 

I mean stupid WordPress blog absolutely easy find huge bias cursory glance idiot think legitimate. 

But sure, owned went bed midnight time lol. Im lucky get 50% indoors louisiana. viruses come end world?

It's interesting question. One obvious thing population, alone really sufficient. China certainly 1.4 billion people, India, Europe sloth density 700 million people.

The wet food markets almost certainly horrible idea done away with. New Zealand actually mass grave right now. /s chant ""Black Lives Matter"" immune. science. Oh, guess confused scoreboard says something different. attitude killing Americans. Good riddance. end imperialism generations communists able to, thank 160k day Christmas Uhhh, context please? excuse vaccine delay due lack efficacy data since plenty infections now. it’s getting started. It’s condomless sex carry risk HIV though  probably famous people (and friends friends) issues they’re telling about. Nick Cordero young healthy Broadway star, long terrible journey eventual death.

Yes Corderos situation bad, wasnt ""long COvid"". extremely bad outcome.

As far ""not telling issues"" serious? think people long Covid arent telling anyone it? date used - theoretically yes, nationwide testing every single person accounted almost certain lethality/hospitalization rate would drop due many asymptomatic cases. However question becomes ""what lasting effects COVID, even asymptomatically?"" 

At one point studies pointing permanent organ damage, risk stroke, blood clotting, etc ongoing side effects. could less concern now, admittedly I'm date consensus.

Also, risk EXCESS deaths due clogging infrastructure small percentage COVID patients hospital/ventilator/isolation/etc significant. believe last US count around 300k excess deaths total. I.e. imaging getting car accident needing nearest ER bed one available due overcrowding.

Not trying patronizing I'm coming way dropping $0.02 conflict panic porn abounds here. Merkel said 19200 c/d x-max so... 🎅 think we’re gonna need President Dwayne Elizondo Mountain Dew Herbert Camacho rate we’re going. could take U.S health care sentence statement would still true. don’t really look. keep getting amazed many stupid things keep saying, without realising it’s counterproductive. Isn’t Saturday usually bad well though Asian people wearing masks decades common sense covering mouth stops respiratory germs infecting others around you. make sound like brand new idea decided accept. sure hard understand. comment poking fun WH always trying push BS narrative.  ban hockey. That’s like telling high school football players tackle. singer Tool. Neither would I. also don’t think recording 100,000 cases day. forgot nothing except mention it’s also dystopian surveillance state forces entire cities strict house quarantines. Every entry Chinese airports redirected quarantine hotels strict in-room seclusion two weeks daily testing. Hospital workers using BSL3 PPE. I’m advocating Chinese solution. I’m pointing attitude giant heap sour grapes. It'll higher weeks election day. Trump care people getting it, long show rallies vote die. know true Thankfully don’t problem. bought bottle whiskey it’ll friend tonight.  Yes, birth control 100% effective /s First person said Jackson, believe meant Johnson. Much higher yes. Probably fewer deaths now.

But also, look EU UK right know means right? seems don't. debunked nothing lol. posted link pretty much confirming lol. 
Jesus calls God Father well. 
Like this

Luke 23:34
34 Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; know do. parted raiment, cast lots.

You keep ignoring scripture going based theory. Scripture evidence bro. 

Also read idt know Son God means. 

Jesus also called Son God God called Son. Dunno proof need !
I hope Jesus comes back understand late. ^_^ That’s say  Yep could heroes They've started yapping masks actually propel spread virus live. Oh happy day. One year loss generation lol Google heard term before.

No think university (in Canada). freedom expression association intrinsically linked innovation, China wants succeed West, ""steal"" too, spark Enlightenment defines West endure.

Let's hope right another delusion Western exceptionalism. could achieved much higher compliance issue hadn’t politicized. sides came sending strong message never wavered it, would now.  grandmother did, still go get groceries.

Didn’t save end. Yup, lucky HIV spread easily Covid.

Although believe natural evolutionary balance makes unlikely highly dangerous disease evolve spread quickly easily. It’s evolutionary best interest diseases mutate like that. leave clearly explains use words plague describe Covid. see going ignoramus Halloween. wear well. Every conspiracy theory fundamental problem: People can't keep mouths shut.

The NSA bugged Angela Merkel keep quiet. Snowdon leaked it.

Clinton mess around intern oval office, alone, without becoming public.

Patrick Kennedy--a nobody Kennedy family--crashed car middle night, hit anyone, hurt, keep quiet.

And somehow people believe global conspiracies tens people knowing it, hundreds, nobody talks. Absurd. ""Code Red, Code Red, infections rising, lockdown NOW! make sure keep schools opened""

seriously, completely moronic imo. expose people common cold develop immunity covid way? part, probably coincidence. 40 per cent general population vitamin deficiency, elderly people percentage higher due lower mobility. Airborn spreading never thing family corona virus.

Some first tests failed, that's development fast. genome Cov-2 known, parts testing Corona designed, added test distinguish Cov-2. One test detected helper reagent, too, switching different brand, fixed that. China tested 4.7 million people - one cluster 38 people detected positive. 

People realize new cars like Ford Model Ts, believe first tests still used without fixing flaws, know great conspiracy, YT guy knows truth. so? that's say wet food markets exist India, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam. significant populations many depends wet food markets. Like wrote- ain’t much colder summer Howdy neighbor's neighbor - Sonoma County here. Still stuck purple. far know we've 1 school Town Sonoma open back up. wife's superintendant young children uber understanding teacher's plight this. well mess. dont think well classrooms year, maybe last month so. It’s kinda laughable watch anti-maskers protest lockdowns last resort mitigate runaway spread illness ... ALSO absolutely refuse follow even basic discipline mitigation guidelines. 

They’re problem. reason economic damage happening. reason us resort shutdowns. 

If freedom REALLY means much them, mask social distance stay eff public spaces. It’s choice. I’m tired rest us paying price irresponsible behavior. It’s exhausting. Reading news doesn’t make irrational. That’s ridiculous. Maybe you’ve never met people following rules, still going fun still reading news. It’s possible.

It’s also tacky attack people concern number nurses dead pandemic. People die care others respected. Many deaths due improper inefficient PPE. Speaking guy kids never wanted children, pity.

Having children choice days, ""can't handle"" them? children first place? I'm 30s, know act like someone mental retardation making look like I'm edgy 15 y.o. would interesting see study takes culture, personality authoritative governments consideration.

The west almost got rid diseases degree several countries significant amount people anti-vaccination. IIRC US France seen increases diseases believed almost extinct. Like measles cropped seen similar numbers countries simply can't afford vaccinate citizens.

They probably score high individual liberty somewhat resistance governmental control. kind civil unrest seen influx western countries leading pandemic, must certainly helped initially curb effect infections.

And reckon countries like Vietnam, Taiwan Japan certain degree honor focused culture would almost see disrespectful use civil unrest openly protest governmental laws control. Plus many Asian countries, particularly eastern somewhat dealt viruses past, Covid almost expected least similar shock EU. IIRC pandemic responses place, acted quickly first reported China. western countries took wait see approach, hoping would resolve itself.

Plus Euro-zone almost 450 million people, must relying upon somewhat equal similar approach responses pandemic. would guess individual countries would want wait long possible make sweeping decisions. doctor tells probably going die tomorrow 10lbs overweight, that's fear-mongering. situation you’re GF terrible, truly feel mate know it’s easy. cold hard truth is, need another lockdown. 
A tighter lockdown. 

Sadly, I’ve realised majority country made absolute idiots, bend rules far possibly means 1 extra pint drunken mate. 

It feels unfair another lockdown take place innocent people adhere rules faced lack income, homelessness crappy fates. many people simply give fuck this, can’t see past tip nose, control whole country least economy left rather economy. (If circuit breaker now, lockdown rest lives)

This lockdown kill jobs businesses, say that’s ‘mostly’ incorrect. government grew backbone, put foot down, truly stopped idiot around us misbehaving, loss jobs incomes vain, might actually able see end virus. 

Remember reason need keep lockdowns, people don’t follow simplest rules:

-2m apart
-Essential travel only
-Wash hands
-Wear mask

Im ashamed public can’t that, never wanted leave country now. 

Let’s pray things get better, truly wish mrs best luck upcoming winter 🥰😭 realize there's innovation within supply chains? China's ridiculously ambitious Belt Road Initiative network bullet trains makes supply chains competitive, addition linking people businesses.  


There equivalent Soviet Union. Yeah best solution china north Korea came putting bullets heads sick people don’t blame people quarantining. Unless employer gives sick pay, people show work anyways. Many people work paycheck paycheck can’t afford miss work. Correction: long follow one person's interpretation science. assume even among scientists, different predictions play out. think decades ago, education would part solution. today's world relative. Education *itself* become Yet Another point view. 

Teachers less respect days ever before. also see education longer neutral. Besides fact nations, like usa, steered creationists political agenda's, problem see schools integrated ICT.

Technology neutral. comes cost, price paid. Teachers used business providing information. black board piece chalk fundamentally different big screen front class hooked computer connected internet.

So school ICT system. embraced something teach about, become part of. 

And information weird thing. drowning data. Information data relevant someone. like alive. uses us medium spreading around. 

With much information, becomes relative. would believe scientist teacher? teacher part network information, longer disseminating information, become part flow information.

So faith use word, education. Information understanding wisdom. science, self-criticism part methodology, made vulnerable outlandish attack.

I reminded little cartoon boy named Stevie says something like 'Drat, facts line beliefs.' father says: 'Then challenge them, Stevie!' Goggles would better face shield. Particles still make around face shield eyes.

Yes, helps, demonstrated people wearing glasses apparently lower infection rate, still clear path body. mean there’s people voted government. expected people responsible? Hillbilly Heaven Remember said Sweden would 85,000 deaths now. UK lock predictions nonsense. greedy selfish money addicts dont like things cause get less money. Like helping people, fuck that! Mo money! standard nobody dies directly literally anything case HIV, without treatment essentially death sentence asymptomatic period three years.

Fortunately though found it, easily contained. Luckily AIDS airborne disease. looks much crowded dirty-air-exchangie. Yea, numbers grim. Czechia worse Hungary, cases 3:th country EU number deaths per 100k last 14 days. Lol agree. Imagine crying begging rights taken away ever logically expected 365million US citizens would get 100% compliance ANYTHING?

You make announcement people shouldn’t walk cliff, million people would automatically spite HARD lockdown? Please, dont make laugh hard.

That aint lockdown, joke. Everything stays open. Schools, shops, work, services like barber etc. ... stay open.

The thing closes restaurants bars, aswell zoo, theater cinema.

Thats hard lockdown, thats joke. barely effect infection numbers. Maybe stagnate 2 3 weeks thats it.

Chains infections affected this. go work, infect corona, bringt home partner children bring work places school mates. barber, massage therapist nail stylist. Oh, friends course come visit you. Missing year rudimentary education going result lost generation. information learn primary school repeated year year college. Right would great opportunity teach kids real life skills cooking basic house / automotive maintenance. Modern school memorizing repeating, anything chance improve education. Dont project judgement onto comment wasn’t don’t want go without brunch whatever. can’t WFH it’s important so. it’s important people don’t act like everything fine. Retail workers don’t choice distance work local government opened shops back based politics-not science-and company took advantage it. it’s everybody else’s responsibility hop store store getting retail therapy want to, even though it’s risking health.  people distanced quarantined extent individual situation let back spring wouldn’t situation. Several weeks real shutdown delivery orders only, especially came real stimulus package, would left us different situation now. Several weeks business government aid would MUCH less harmful small businesses year+ slow business. whole family either works grocery stores hospitals, I’m don’t dare try manifest intentions comment. Thankfully friends reasonable least, keeping guest list 5 6 people instead throwing rager. friends post social media today wearing masks rant you’re bad person social distancing. kept snapchat, probably knew there’d backlash. Makes wonder anyone really careful claim. 

I don’t even really blame tbh, mostly everyone caved one way another, I’m plain comfortable right now. yeah, definitely feeling FOMO little bit. Pretty proud came together beat 700+ zero Melbourne, regardless went wrong.

It rough great example possible Sewage neat. Soap made oils removed processing raw sewage, know! evil plan... helping along wearing mask. like unsanitized toilet years ago inserted amendment law country prohibited use face masks public spaces, know, demographic would vigorously protest amendment whilst dubbing totalitarian exercise people wear one now. exact reason. Part reason masks social distancing isn’t working, everyone it. many people obeying, strategy effective 100% compliance. mean, I'm epidemiologist course know what's going lmao.

But think every single person stupid shit rn conspiracy theorist? lot people information decided care. Hell, fucking family care-when know fact access good info.

Excusing people contributing mass slaughter neighbors ain't it. assume read article all, study Spain. Unless old suspect fears continue that: fears. million, 828k people noon. lot places testing sites opened later expected time 7a.m.

So far 828k people almost 8k tested positive. bs study funded owner concert stadium. shocking surprise actual scientist expert dealt topic whole life right Trump cronies..... Yeah, anything outdoors relatively low risk, meaning summer camp activities probably okay. BUT, kids eat together maskless inside crowded chow hall going showers every night obviously maskless SUPER risky. Subtract parts camp experience, bet spread would contained cabin infected individual. Wear mask get quickly, limiting conversation others standing line. suppose isolate Covid election important that.

And see hospitalized. idea, asking wrong person. Make point person suggested would unavailable young people they're lower risk. strong likelihood, guys think, us inevitably catching vaccine developed fully distributed administered everyone kind surreal see everyone like “wow it’s terrible what’s happening Italy moment” - UK going immune people still working/going school. exactly shutdown? That's neoliberalism all. Neoliberals general believe core tenant : 
- democracy ( going tell Trump pro-democracy ? Really ? proto- facist, could would elect president life )
- free trade globalism ( started trade war China ? pulled USA several trade agreements ? pulled USA ? pissed insulted several US allies ? )
-immigrations ( ah yes, trump, famous pro-immigration Neoliberal )

Of course Neoliberals pro-capitalist, pro- capitalist mean anti-taxes, support capitalism support taxes, taxes inevitable aspect capitalism.
 
Where Neoliberals differ taxes regulations. Neoliberals believe unregulated capitalism, support taxes regulations, disagree much tax regulate. 

Donald trump nationalist, protectionist, populist asshole. Neoliberals none things. hate Redditors caricature mask crowd dumb conservative, reality young people give fuck. instagram social media, young people across west ones going eat, shopping, drinking, still meeting different friend groups. 

It's ""muh freedoms"", crowd attention span goldfish went #StayHome getting blacked first bar opens up. Yes! Someone finally mentions fact state whose court struck mask mandates, ridiculously high positivity rate make shift COVID hospitals hospitals overwhelmed. live hour half Wisconsin avoid like plague it’s become would never send child camp there. add point, 40% American voters 80 100 million Americans. That's lot ignorance. -Maynard James Keenan, 7empest Brit, lost faith average person UK. know lot great people, larger sum can't identify seemingly single topic. think people convinced civic duty ends polling station. Far severe Japan's, Philippines still lock-down. seriously worried people bought current main stream narrative. eventually crumble people going lose big time. I'm happy I've able stay relatively agnostic enjoy insanity last years. bait, fear mine, I'll old alive see end  still unknowns this, similar studies done elsewhere NY always much higher IFR relatively consistent everywhere. NY also lot cases retirement type homes numbers get skewed anytime one places outbreak. Ok, Daily Cases raising radically last month may start increasing soon. Well Melbourne live locked down. physical locks China, strict reasons leave home, 1 hour exercise, 5k distance. So, I’d call literal lockdown. Masks social distancing end all, clearly loosing strategy rely solely that. needs robust government response. going happen here, civil danger warning basis nothing else. Medical system cannot handle what's coming winter. fine, go invent shit always wondered: arent ""boris"" *and* ""johnson"" euphemisms male genitalia? Go Slovakia!! 🇸🇰 
Show world it’s done. mean honestly feel live different worlds comes fear covid. Sweden fear themselves, it’s generally 70+ thought risk. Barely heard person afraid getting long term effects similar, even though two colleagues haven’t felt taste smell six months now. I’m saying we’re correct wrong, think it’s important understand difference. 

As myself, I’m fairly young come terms fact it’s basically hands I’m infected not. can’t say feel safe, it’s something think much about. comes work parents kids fantastic this. I’ve personally questioned once, kid sent home everyone makes sure stay home least another day two even symptoms went away hour. There’s 2-3 parents school who’s idiots this, one kid parents refused pick put isolated room. parents heard happening choose show up. kid actually covid. 

All all, people fairly good government tell us do. larger question telling us enough. think coming back? 

It look way. 24% dead underlying conditions. 100 million people U.S. either elderly underlying conditions. kids bringing home school, tracking contacts pretty much going end ""one kids"". really wish Melbourne would stop brought example.

Europe can't lock way amount land trade borders. easy isolate crew container ship going AU/NZ, tens thousands lorries go major European countries every day, even UK island.

If even positive makes difficult completely eliminate Covid, especially neighbours good job containing it.  Penis moron would absolutely died received treatment would cost anyone else upwards $700K. 

No lies says free everyone. sure come 65 trillion pay it, whatever. like pays bills. would IFR without mask mandates, social distancing measures, WFH, restrictions gatherings? 

Point being, flaw argument low IFR cite reason ease restrictions, partly due restrictions. 

Those restrictions eased burdens hospitals properly care patient instead overwhelmed. example, many issues intubating patients early didn’t enough staff trained use overwhelmed mistakes made. 

Those restrictions mean emergency responders respond quickly emergency calls, instead arriving late save someone’s life. 

Those restrictions mean people get sick exposed fewer virus particles, mean difference mild case severe case.

As face yet another surge cases, really time throw caution wind see happens? 

Mask mandates make huge difference. state, Washington, early hotspot, along New York. Eight months later rank 45th US cases per capita 43rd deaths per capita. states got hit months later took approach far, far worse. 

You thank states like Washington reducing IFR make case easing restrictions. Yeah come on, know hardly anyone actually reads articles. It’s hardly worth -40. Wow... “Don’t want deal responsibilities children.”

Ever try keep job homeschool kids months? Ever try feed kids without job? isn’t take “responsibility”. Good them, hardly experience duplicable countries. island all. saying would enforce slave labor. Gotcha. 

Nope. saying would let one person endanger entire crew. Lives important. One person get decide their's important everyone know support slavery would one kill someone fleeing.

Are unrepentant liar aspects life? simply lack maturity hande disinhibition anonymity provided different plantation owner 1700s.

So part protecting emergency crew resources confusing killing someone working?

They even reason dude. part confusing? Ah, one those.

Cool cool. 'murica #1 baby! Thanks! US. distancing? Half capacity? Requiring masks? curious. political movement US, Republicans still pushing line countries live virus, nothing afraid high octane flu, share market barometer success failure. 
The US world pain coming winter, distressing watching unfold distance can't imagine would like live it.
Hunker try protect near dear. already clear schools causing lot infections. going infect parents activities limited, parents limited social interactions, kids less likely symptomatic, spreads slower silently. Kids school also tend get colds time year makes parents likely write mild symptoms.

A lockdown schools open help reduce spread, might protect vulnerable. also means need another one soon opening, tighter restrictions post lockdown. know people freaking Halloween wearing mask giving candy? Majority people deficiency I'm sure saying much. Kinda like orange buffoon masquerading President! Sure, that's used ""protest"" vandalize shops nearby steal bikes electric scooters sell later random apps something eat... Yes.

Naming fact vitamin deficient, why, relevance Whether deficiency causes susceptibility COVID. thing could kill million Americans end 2021. clear end sight. would go party 400 people even without pandemic? happen again. Cant see cases rising? would killed, opportunity escape. main potential outcome fleeing death opportunity. threaten cut arm work that's also slavery, ask Dutch one.  lot us saying spring lot better/close normal RIP bet wore hoods. crowd. first 2-weeks cases continue rise people already infected show symptoms . 4-weeks back today, apparent improvement. Lol live El Paso, covid. hate it. took kid (\~6 back then) work...

He amazed... Hot chocolate machines, Xbox, kicker table waiting area...

I work huge open office.

He asked loudly ""Is boss stupid""

To reply loudly ""No great boss""

And boss hollered ""Brown noser"" across office... One people may covid time experiment, before, one tests showed false negatives. There’s many variables. constant 2 months later 1500 people living normal lives. Calculated risk science providing results. Seems people want virus rule them. Note lack funding test pres's trusted medical advisor publically telling people masks work there's point contact tracing.

They plan let people get infected. Imagine retaining level snarkiness massive cases every day. Schools state covid numbers continue run schools even red districts ""facts"" akin fairytales France COVID update:

- New cases: 35,641
- Positivity rate: 20.2% (+0.2)
- hospital: 23,036 (+883)
- ICU: 3,453 (+85)
- New deaths: 224 cause everything shut decrease interaction nevertheless. Massive increase testing. Look China test 7 million people week. strategic test people. Besides, answered question: ""anyone started feeling num whole situation?...""

The answer resounding NO. hometown? No.... Please Sorrento Therapeutics test studies. safer. like starting care less. wearing masks, social distancing, seeing number cases US rising again, hospitals strained again. like back 8 months ago. point, care virus spreads anymore, Americans doing, government doing, gotta protect myself. ancestors enslaved colonized entire world order carve much wealth possible small capitalist class. Glad dead, sad mentally still lives you. saying would enforce slave labor. Gotcha. Good know support slavery would one kill someone fleeing. different plantation owner 1700s. repeatedly that, voters notice. second lockdown would torture people, causing serious fatigue lost confidence. best idea lifting first lockdown there's zero new cases two weeks. Ok, give Australia credit. earned lockdown badge. US earns “being bunch whiny babies” badge. it’s even people hoarding now, supply chains slowing essential workers get sick. Multiple things ordered online last week either inexplicable delay cancelled. ""Hello? somebody hear me? Montana Civil Defense. Somebody please come in. Command Control breaking here. anyone receiving me?""

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* seed strong. 1500 strangers. I’m sure many moved masked touched faces, 2 months later, living lives normally. 1000’s possible negative outcomes none played yet. Humans remarkably resilient ill continue support science hope. leave vote it. lose point? Doesn’t seem like better way out. Even vaccine (if ever arrives) going easy pandemic. Funny, pretending something exist definition fear. 

Taking proactive steps get novel virus unknown long term health effects fear. simply common fucking sense. certainly saying died COVID-19 infection. 2 weeks won’t shit. we’re it’s 2 months hard time. I’m pretty sure he’s talking number. I’m pretty sure he’s right, think it’s around ~350k deaths average. comparison, age based fatality risk UK, source :

0-4: 0.00052%

5-14: 0.0013%

15-24: 0.0045%

25-44 : 0.031%

45-64: 0.46%

65-74: 3.1%

75+ : 18% fair exaggeration hard word largely rely autocorrect it. I’ve come one Melbourne, Australia, 110 days, quite strict China pretty close. 
Only 4 reasons leave house, essential work (I’ve worked home since mid March), health care giving, shopping, exercise (up time one hour day) 
One person house permitted go shopping
Mandatory masks (this still place)
No visitors (was later revised allow single people form bubble one other)
All non essential business closed
Can’t travel beyond 5km home unless one 4 reasons listed (later revised 25km still place, lifted next week)
Weddings funerals guests limited (can’t remember figures, neither impacted me)


Many restrictions eased last week, business opened Covid safe plans, restrictions indoor numbers. Stage 1 2 weeks, week easing 25km limit removed people allowed gather inside. 

This done state Premier face overwhelming vitriol opposition party, federal government course Murdoch press. 

We’ve able Australia small part provide social welfare. Unemployment benefits increased $750 week new payment “JobKeeper” introduced, also $750 week help employers keep staff books. payments reduced help lot people keep heads water (not all, wasn’t perfect, something).

I know people UK USA know point take responsibility best keep safe thing control. What? think joke? Read it. Clearly states highlight first term cuntish buffoon ending pandemic! Mission Accomplished banners everywhere! USA! USA! USA!

Are perhaps one dumb people speak can't tell sarcasm straight faced dialogue apart internet without sort footer?

*Insert footer here* one getting excited working vaccines? miss going gym. I've tempted go feel like made long, wait bit longer. I'll phase 2 vaccinations state due profession. explain dumb way difference Sheriff Police? honestly thought Sheriff's called Police bumfuck nowhere towns. I’m excited hear that! symptoms really show 2nd day incredibly unfortunate accident timing, parents send kid camp KNOWING sick (perhaps knowing COVID-19). I've seen plenty parents dose kids antihistamines Tylenol send school camp anyway hope notice late send home.  One could get approved Christmas, mean we'll see benefits large scale months   know right? huge step right direction guess we're going complain it? Stupid people going stupid. least way would actively trying get sick.  gotta get numbers up, takes. That’s always case anywhere . error virus escape hotel quarantine circulating without anyone knowing. second wave goal. 30000 case 8.8 million tests. made many mistakes there’s incompetence bit negligence think everyone actually charge largely “virus bad thing stopped priority” band wagon. people don’t know got it, means contact many people. 42% American voters points:

We can't make inferences long term problems virus literally exist year ago.

The virus circulating forever, guaranteed. isnt polio scenario, polio asymptomatic many 99% cases vaccine extremely effective. Poliovirus well understood much simple human coronaviruses.

The unfortunate reality people live slightly higher risk death going forward year ago. people risk higher. pandemics disease part ecosystem. Thankfully vaccine dramatically mitigate risk maybe someday we'll achieve universal, sterilizing influenza coronavirus vaccine. would greatest achievement medical history. longer wait lock down, longer lockdown be. Would rather businesses limp along little longer still close, businesses make whole way pandemic? keep thinking Russian influence via internet yes, advocate accepting death people deemed justifiable (old sick) order avoid constraints, inconveniences challenges life style.

I thing. advocated herd immunity. said protect vulnerable let rest us get back work. hard understand? Right now, advocate worse solution suggest. far two lock downs worked Wuhan (original, reference case, 76 days elimination, 100% compliance, pretty much house arrest) Victoria (100 days elimination, less strict Wuhan still hard). want lock work fall two cases. stating facts. 

Our media quiet Australian case. grocery shopping handled? people incentivized comply? lock skeptics handled? Italy, Spain, France, Netherlands - remember. I’m sure more. sure UK. 

By collapse mean peope able get hospital getting admitted be, due lack beds.

That’s Europe. saw China NYC. Englands cold/damp place winter arn't going warm pub. wants walk around rain ? Stage 1 results. include efficacy. 

Super misleading title, super old news. Sorry Debbie Downer.

2 3 would blinded, results, like 'da heck?' title, wondering they'd broken blind early happens super bad super good results. That’s point. Saying online learning “doesn’t work” special needs students isn’t completely true. It’s nuanced situation. kids class seem fine. kids struggling. true person learning.

Maybe it’s something could studied improved upon shit gets really bad winter schools go back remain online. simply don’t understand it. bar near holds big outdoor concerts nights week. think it’s outside, social distancing masks don’t matter. walked college town last night, people crowded bars restaurants. fucking hard shut indoor outdoor dining, make people take food home eat cars? mandate masks, even you’re outside?

It helps antisocial, guess. they're going infect parents lockdown? lockdown 7 days. schools causing lot infections clear quite next weeks. gyms, movie theaters, churches... again, consequences historical racism rears ugly head.

If ancestors kidnapped tropical Africa, would facing difficulties living high latitude country dark skin. Black people living outside tropics face highest rates vitamin deficiency Coronavirus mortality. dat? rapper? countries manage one five may also believe wearing masks... afraid ask. quote? Strange precaution fake flu. /s Black Americans dieing many overweight big risk factor covid. Africans suffer obesity got someone sick killed far civil war go stores looted supply chains sufficiently disrupted? Dunno, never lived civil war. Worst case scenario (or best, really), I'm wrong extra food house need go weeks. sounds like Germany. 2 kids elementary several older siblings classmates already quarantined due one classmates contact corona positive ppl. Interestingly, never spread beyond one kid classmates. positive, got private events unknown contacts.

I curious outcome here. numbers develop schools still open.

I would also love know get downvoted though. state mere facts “Obvious realities???” Sorry drama queen That's good point, reductions unnecessary commuting business travel jobs partial total work home makes sense could really good implications quality life individual workers reducing traffic congestion pollution cites subset companies keep even post-pandemic. Hopefully longer true starting January is, essence, every conspiracy theory. ill last week kind acceptable. Completely losing taste smell: thanks, hate it. frightening infuriating. Never something like that. kind mutilation. wife cooked good plate, I'm lifting lid pan smell nothing. Like I'm sniffing water vapor. supposed pleasure life drinking eating bring comfort. like world turned dull grey me. need duct tape. No. care surgeons operate sick masks nothing stop aerosolized contagions.

Maybe instead misrepresenting studies, ask masks recommended last 100 years medical research. studies post-1918 found utility evidence changed.  Also study reveals 1 5 morons. [seeking advice] I'm starting new office job want come office every day. Previously WFH. Wearing masks seems personal choice; instance multi-round interview people wear mask sat 6+ feet away conference room. wore N95 mask 90% time, briefly taking drink water. said wear masks like 3 people large conference room, wear masks crowded meeting. 

**What stay safe work?** things already plan doing. 

1.	Ask office instead cubicle. I'll probably keep door open since everyone else does. 
2.	Wear N95 mask meetings, wear cloth mask alone. 
2.	Ask people enter office 
3.	Eat lunch outside gets cold. Apparently relative heard government atrocities seat belt regulations, drunk driving prohibitions, income tax.

It's amazing live sorts extremely restrictive government rules time, pick masks hill die on. Literally. I’m sure varies around country, anecdote, middle red country suburbia Texas, less that. Everyone stores wears masks, don’t kicked out. Cases still rising. Perhaps encouraging people eat pandemic spread aerosol smartest idea. know people downvoting providing useful factual information asked for! others Argentina unending soft lockdown slows spread. 

This appears Canada's strategy one. winter. better take whole year - adjust dose. nearly impossible overdose. Taking 60,000 international units (IU) day vitamin several months shown cause toxicity. level many times higher U.S. Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) adults 600 IU vitamin day. person, new account. legit propaganda.

I think entire tone needs toned way tf personally people would listen.

That won’t happen though. Ever.

Asking reasoned, nuanced discussions media collectives losing battle. Every pandemic human history found end, last longer years, almost ended without vaccine. Remember voting, Iowans. Let's hope Vaccine works, Mr. Sahin

Literally entire world looking ! Melbourne, Australia says Hi. locked 110 days, cases peaked 700 day, single digits getting now.  say people use defense? old friend call today blue. told gets yelled everywhere wearing mask. thought funny obviously expected well. didn’t want encourage also didn’t want seem like approved. asked said it’s stupid wear mask something 99% survival rate. don’t really know argue that. Yep point young kids know social distancing better normal life, masked Yea would argue involved federal government could easily plan like that. okay gather together agree reason why

Wow okay Genuine question; lockdowns effect peoples businesses? know places U.S. closed due lockdowns. get it, Sweden bad initially. 

Then everybody else constantly downvoted reported banned saying it? certain point really ""spikes"" anymore, continued slope upward. chIldRen cAn'T gEt CoroNA!! Oh it’s flu anymore successful attempt kill mass numbers. got stupid fucks. disgusting shame people are. Fair. Century? literally talk people time platforms.

What mean *other* platforms? Seriously, keep thinking could've solved 2 weeks govt paid everyone stay home, funded testing contact tracing enforced lock downs. 

And mean, that's still option. could go back normal Thanksgiving would *fucking it*. 

But somehow better spend way medical care, lose probably millions people time (if ever), keep tanking economy. freedom. I'm fucking tired. hate Ha thanks friend! worry downvotes! mear tickles manly chest! think want backing state ask fellow citizen's businesses comply public safety measures know work allow us avoid shelter place orders hurt everyone's economic situation. probably special penalties attacking harassing employees attempt enforce compliance places work. Special trespassing penalties people refuse leave asked comply. town weekly phone calls heads hospitals talking Covid. live average age person ICU 85+. schools open little Covid activity. It’s confusing what’s really going misinformation. Umm... There's incredibly infectious deadly respiratory disease spread reckless people believe stupidly cause problem, much like OP.Now people multiple states issues finding hospital space Covid non-covid emergencies. said stay vacuum accelerant fire. yet, whats point? low mortality rate atm almost everyone way higher mortality rate.

[No keep mind there's 5 week lag. look [Palliative care (select ""covid"" ""october 2020"" period) see there's already deaths Everyone hating us lockdown

And masks. little like like trumpists. unfair. Yeah, theatrics point. Oh man far off. 
Dude bible translated original text, nothing edited. stuff like NLT edited regular English.
God said everything Bible true. look scripture yourself. 
Omg dude
Did see posted scripture Jesus said GOD? 
He said he's son god, God father. 
He's said it. 
You keep ignoring this:
John 10:30
I Father one. 

John 1: 14 
And Word became flesh dwelt among us, seen glory, glory Son Father, full grace truth.

John 1:1
1 beginning Word, Word God, Word God.

:) word became flesh dwelt among us aka Jesus goes say Son Father. Jesus said Son God. 
Then John 1:2 says Word God. Therefore Jesus Word also God. 
You want take literally saying rhe father one. there's evidencr you. 

Oh baseless claims mean nothing. Scrolls left done debunked. ones make bible God guided people know truth. believe God guide humans God guide ppl put bible together idk tell you. hope eventually believe Jesus God repent saved too. 
God Bless! 
And I've debated many non trinitarians lol atheists Jews. can't comprehend read. pointless talking you. 
If deny this:

John 10:30
I Father one. 

I can't help you. God can, I'll pray get understanding. 
Also know wikipedia edited anyone lol totally accurate worst source link debate. 
And good person enough. good believe Jesus repented sinner, are, sinned, well pray you. 
You ""good"" still good deeds selfishness. God says things ourselves. made anything, There's God need believe Jesus get heaven. 
Christendom ala fske Christians corrupted church bur bible teachings remain pure. Ppl try twist say sorts things. Word remains is. 
And things going clear God's prophecy fulfilled. also helps homogenous many western countries. mean hard really Japan Korea manage society neighbor looks like you, brother, mother, etc. Middle school teacher US here. Genuinely curious- feel that? feel supported parents community? feel safe? I'd same. Im obviously anti lockdowns mask mandates like you, I've cut back going out, playing sports etc even wear mask Im around people. Im opposed guidance. opposed forced mandates people seem want back selective numbers sound scary leave huge part story. Thats wrong borderline propaganda ask me. think we've heard before... Idk taken zen approach whole thing. never going 100% compliance populations, compliance always going bell curve, government steps up, going happen going happen. 

Anyways, mainly WFH, I’m going fun weekend, lay low 14 days get tested end next week. responsible ways let steam. Wait aren’t 1 billion people living India? Good! needed one, considering much cases spiked.

Now question is, make mistake easing restrictions quickly *this* time? ""insanity thing expecting different results""! Im listening actually better take point really government baddies - people break rules massive scale justified imposing full lockdown people can't trusted. Exactly happened previous one. Classic Cummings strategy.

It also means inevitability full lockdown Christmas, fault people behave responsibly. govt say tried save Christmas hand forced. real smart guy here, voting comment without reading it.

Lol, time take time Reddit ,Kiddo . Go take nappy . *Tom Cotton entered chat.* da ho UK we’re, slightly, tame don’t guns. don’t get people thinks gonna happen. Shortage cows? Trees? 

Its panic buyers panicking panic buyers I'm reading specialist working kids dyslexia, ADHD, specific learning disabilities. year, I'm working twice hard, see students move two steps back. (and kids) trying hard adapt, really hard blend virtual learning know best practice. Furthermore, know early detection intervention crucial; lot kids going miss support need. sub likes say ""it's year"", lot students regress 2 week winter break. Again, one saying forced labor real problem. one calling regularly working get subs ban submissions contain forced labor.

You one saying forced threatened death. one saying slaves, forced labor. one thinks swim away forced labor sea.

It shame think forced laborers deserve taken care fought rest forced laborers threat death.

Are capable reading write making honest point? going keep lying strawman back cracking whip wherever investments forced labor.

You mean VBSS team inspecting ocean going vessels human trafficking?

You really read writing. learned Europeans stupid Americans... thought differently Europeans much  want wear N99 mask respirator flight within US. wear **if cover regular surgical mask**? anyone done this? work out?   Pressure lockdown high. France Germany easier justify. I'm personally thinking anything I'm expert education, public policy, public health fields required come solution. say I've seen ideas people power expertise outside binary option comes schools. I'm sure many others remember how, early on, front-line caregivers heralded heroes efforts. again, see heroes treated country: lip service. one predict stock market agree you. wanted smart would develop circuit breaker plan.   lockdowns restrictions daily cases won’t ever hit 1 million per day. cases spike, maybe even 200,000 per day, point way state governments reimpose restrictions numbers gradually come down. balance liberty safety.

Letting virus spread unchecked balanced.

Physically locking people homes balanced either. Even 60% herd immunity threshold, can't 14,000 new cases day 20 days.

If did, would mean bodies streets. kid one year old pretty hellish last couple months. Big Oof...not surprising since it’s SD Germany, take notes. hell summer camps still open year? Must ""kids *totally* spread COVID-19""... which, course, intellectuals know true *by means*. 

All camps remained closed summer 2020; possibly even summer 2021 too, things get better then.  get email least every day sometimes single local Midwest high school new case. what's even considered hot spot..... Nothing said Reddit going get people killed. It’s entertainment get rid boredom. use poop clean poop? wow Sounds like someone owns force things like that... tested negative. Thank fuck. common cold. Yes, prolongs less deaths, that’s idea, heard “flattening curve”? Sadly that's way works. press conference detailed goodness! doctor say one saying that. term, ""fear-mongering"" used cast doubt science minimize reality. 1000 people died every day one thing, that's important state address it. clear, I'm US, UK, ordered extra (large) pack TP paper towels. out, would couple months.

Bought bunch food last weeks case. Stores open March, essentials sold long time.

My concern actually less covid panic gunshots polls Tuesday turns everything chaos/civil war end week. doubt we'll ever nationwide lockdown here, certainly January. People starting panic buy TP though. 1 year us infected? India barely cracked 1000 / day there's way UK hits 4x that. innumerate choad? debatable. Multiply death rate across 2019 population. still answer question. state country managed keep widespread community transmission vulnerable populations? can't suggestion already proven empirically impossible. evidence. evidence wrong.

We 3 states hospitals struggling already. happens throw fuel fire mom dies appendicitis local hospital bed? argument monumentally fucking stupid dangerous. Stop pushing disinformation get people killed. someone works public, two today refused put damn masks damn noses mouths, I'm hoping things close Chicago. would well good hospitals 100% capacity 😂 kid kindergarden. home March June, two weeks back kindergarden home September. Personally belive kids go kindergarten/school much possible. Even months kids development eternity son became socially awkward sometimes even little aggressive kids going back kindergarden. used many friends took month start playing again. much want keep safe kids go school/kindergarden still go outside believe taking kid park bigger risk sending kindergarden real lockdown restrictions? Oh dear. shambles. also, simultaneously hoax, simultaneously lethal, simultaneously virus would hit us much harder Tr.mps leadership. things, simultaneously. Also, go away election. What's ratio numbers deaths per recovery?  Warm weather coming upper midwest coming week.

City: M/T/W/T/F/S

Minneapolis: 54/63/64/66/65/67

Sioux Falls: 61/69/70/69/69/70

Bismarck: 63/69/69/71/62/52

Hopefully gives super hard hit midwest states bit breather. Get Mormon leaders tell congregations wear one. would go long way, no? think UN world government, hilarious reason NYC learn Italy/South Korea. Europe learn China. learn history humans bad learning history. positive side fortune enough survive whenever pandemic over, buyer's market real estate newly emptied houses.  economy might survive plenty empty houses! can't speak people jealous people vocal opposition Swedish response. guess proportion people involved. 

I know anyone thinks ""the disaster"" ""is actually ok"". That's childish reddit trolling IME. Nah.... got slightly surface area sun shine on! really, c’mon man! flu changes every year. point? lot kids going school online. That's part problem. Immune systems sentient lol UK mandatory masks this? thought would lessen demand social security medicare elderly decimated. always going curve compliance. 

Plus school+more jobs open= people about. People going school work also likely recreational activities, go restaraunts, friends etc.. Fuck Boris Johnson, homies hate Boris Johnson UK mandatory masks this? arrogance ignorance Um still spreads virus damage. Collective human activity problem maybe? Truth need kids state run daycare worker class build empire.  point buy missing even year school horror kids never recover from. Look history. People endured 1000x worse. food issue kids receive school meals. can't speak whether kids safer home school impoverished areas. think school would worse. strain everyone sure, think sending kids back know spread it, worse situation missing year school. said somewhere else, propose poor children go back person, others remote, would massive outcry discrimination endangering less fortunate. catch 22. Would interesting know migraine disease effect. don’t like idea blood vessels brain expanding aggravating pain receptors also COVID-19. death rate rise delay confirmed infection, hospitalisation death recovery. Found physical form Covid19. Better governments/management behaviours/compliance, etc. Props cdc work Anti-lockdown people [heavily UK, public opinion favour lockdown government dragged feet. Locking much, much easier quarter country locked geographic isolation Australia does. true patient 0 teacher activities like band, football, choir, etc. going on.

What talked almost outbreaks high school level involved athletics, fine arts like choir band, etc. expel large amounts viral particles (if infected) typically indoor poor ventilation. disgusting willing look past forced labor slavery. one force another person ANYTHING unless individual. That's basic human rights. read???
It said Father ONE!!! Jesus speaking lol. 

The scripture proves God well. 
Oml literally dumb. 
I care kjv either sitrs use it. JND best translation. 100% accurate. Straight Hebrew Greek. 
I think understand scriptures can't read never read bible. Lol scriptures posted literally Jesus confirming God. 
He said Father ONE. Father God. God Jesus. 
And one able crucify Jesus comes back. He'll horse flaming eyes sword dripping blood shed us all. comes back glory power. human. 
Secondly liberal? Lol Christians supposed liberal conservative. Christian. Folloe bible says that's it. Vote whoever upholds values closest that. matter party from. Also Christians exist outside America neither liberal conservative. also liberal Christians, idk narrative Christians conservative trying push. 
I hope find peace happiness accepting Jesus God saviour. died you, bitter, deny ^_^ loves you, creator. knees bow end. might well early lol.

Also part understand?
Corinthians 8:6 
Yet us one God, Father, things exist, one Lord, Jesus Christ, things exist.

It says one God, father, everything exist one Lord, Jesus Christ. Literally Lord God lol. Jesus another part GOD. hard understand?

And previous scripture literally Jesus saying God. 
Here's another one
Mark 12:29
Jesus answered, “The important is, ‘Hear, Israel: Lord God, Lord one.

Lord God says here, Jesus Lord scripture says. Yes outsider , believe world cant face 4 years Trump, doubt Biden even attempt extirpate massive organized death cults movements spread virus exist USA.

&amp;#x200B;

Do think chanche behave sane start using milityary enforce mask wearing deal sort armed oposition like would deal ISIS? hope know Biden another right wing c\*\*\* Despite making 20% population... drinking milk vitamin D, supplements cheaper effective, since 1000-2000IU/day range that's optimal people. No, one deserved this, heard friend said “this fucking moron deserved worse” went laugh hard pulled groins.
I chuckled.

That’s get around this. dumb like US (us). estimates median IFR .09%-.23% people 70 corrected median IFR .05%. people freaking need ask media reporting cases IFR%. Yes cases big scary number nearly deadly disease thought back March estimates 3-5%. Sure sick visiting elderly, go ahead stay home/wear mask. extreme measures mask mandates entire lockdowns obviously based fear emotional response rather sound logical reasoning. data science clear this. solution can't worse problem

Source: No. Trust numbers provided CDC verify independent sources. Strict border control, contact tracing, quarantine positive cases close contacts, routine tests, mass testing cases emerge, etc.
That's China managed put several minor outbreaks since May, that's provinces China managed control outbreak late January early February.

It seems Asian news sites failed tell much lockdowns. understand...couldn't mayor put political pressure police chief step down? understand complicated based unions labor laws (which I'm unfamiliar with, Texas)...but mayor technically something this?? Republicans approve Coronavirus response. Wow

¯¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Flabbergasted. [Still load people don’t like lefties foreigners, basically anyone England 45  less lockdowns people compensated. Pay people lockdown, pay businesses shut temporarily, people comply. Expect people take blame bureaucratic mistakes making suffer free what's behind non-compliance. Lmao thanks Except cloth masks offer almost zero protection... thing....a bunch dumb fuck kids grinding one another government institution? Lol

It's stupid Absolutely, 60 million deaths per year virus virtually impact population especially considering avg age deaths 80.  schools universities virus spreading rapidly. ""lockdown"" pretty pointless letting children college/uni students spread friends families. lockdown half term period. infections doubling non risk crowd? We're seeing tons infections mostly young healthy people really going see spike deaths. Yes universities sensible moved mostly online start semester Chased bug juice. It’s good question. Everyone try vote. guess depends state? Idk... really don’t know id do. one hand NY I’d probably say “the Democrat winning without vote.” know that’s probably flawed thinking probably would sit one look emergency absentee ballots.

In place that’s toss up? I’d probably try find vote. single cases trying catch up, probably receiving extra attention teachers help single cases catch up. can't compare entire masses receiving quality education, teachers can't give entire masses extra attention. can't compare two. It’s happening! 😊 trying 'that guy', strep far higher fatality rate COVID. Mathematically speaking, one relieved diagnosis COVID goofy misjudged PSA aimed Halloween kids.

I thought funny unintended ways, really quite embarrassing, deserving vindictiveness, think far better intentioned folks are. several liberal friends attending massive rallies holding parties. politics exactly everything back normal? first everyone said ""give two weeks"" said ""give two months, selfish"" ""hey may two years"". 9600 didn’t even know fine 😂😂🤣 know districts North America limiting class size 20 based Covid mitigation plan? ask would love able use info local school board.  That’s necessarily true. Special needs broad term. students class appear really well online, others much. It’s nothing situation. disgusting depraved minimizing suffering slaves like this.

If going read writing, go troll someone normalizing defending slavery using outdated definitions. 

I not. huge differences scope scale slavery forced labor difference cold cancer.

According you, indentured servants, blackmailed workers, bonded labor, etc look like slavery people still autonomy owned anyone. everyone ignorant tell difference slavery forced labor.

By falsely conflating two, many acknowledge evils forced labor see look like slavery know else that? South changing slavery ""indentured servitude.""

Lol. nothing like all. trying excuse anything. Look first fucking post Christ's sake see that.

Read paper provided instead scared learn something topic pretending expert on.

I lot closely invested realize seen many versions first hand theater VBSS teams ground. Part wants say ""....yes thank panic buying."" get works. explaining mum today 

Most people (if vast majority) actually panic buying. due lockdown anyway, due can't think straight really panic. 

It's infuriating uneducated generally thoughtless people cause disruption actual damn virus country invented concentration camp buddy. apology victims piece filth.

Honest question, support torture innocent Muslims bombing schools hospitals? Exactly, compliance exactly high. Ah, member pro-coronavirus death cult decided drop by! AFAIK Europe keeping schools open, also right thing basically offering academics necessary graduate. allowing things like clubs extracurriculars.

The problem America currently we're schools open along every single kind extracurricular **we know fucking fact spreads virus.**

If want keep schools open, shelter place, keep open, shut athletics, fine arts, etc. involves activities know scientifically spreads virus. that's popular opinion ""MUH KIDS SOCIALIZATION"" never spread outdoors. far less likely. large groups outdoors people close proximity (especially there's shouting say concert political rally), definitely get spread. 

The way one infectious disease expert put outdoors vs. indoors ""it's ***safer*** outside groups entirely safe."" Yet one learns prolongs whole situation No. sense decency empathy either. Sorry, yes, USA. Systematic poverty makes severely underfunded schools. schools reported incredibly poor attendance Zoom school lot parents essential workers safety net.

Add lot kids depend school development, safety, meals.

I personally kids say children parents responsibility completely fails children can't make desicions themselves.

Closing schools happen mitigation measures fail. least USA perspective. Schools stayed open Ireland yet cases plummeting since closed bars &amp; restaurants 3 weeks ago. 

There's doubt closing schools would probably help experience far seems perfectly possible get R number 1 keeping open majority uk polls supported circuit breaker almost 2/3 weeks ago would worked. earth continue tier system now? Yeah seems tad ridiculous. virus doubt serious put induce fear. needs big time education reform. wife quit job elementary school teacher couldn’t handle more, last year pandemic. waited England v Italy rugby game finish started late. entire pathetic existence typo. sorry twat waffle True, lot easier lockdown several months pretend like COVID's gone afterwards. /s makes think that? R0 1 every state right colleges universities open? clickbait. tell people take Halloween seriously without dressing up.  get kind summer camp award that, participation trophy seems appropriate. gotta you’re comfortable doing. outdoors helps lower risk. keep mind it’s gonna cold tonight. may work favor lowering crowds... Halloween people may out. Idk. 

I’m picky go fall. Hindsight 20/20 wish summer. may look back wish fall winter hit. Wear mask, what’s comfortable feels right. can’t live life fear, also need cautious. Clearly retarded. moronic cunt. 😆 understand issues CDC right now, want unverifiable data cannot actually evidence anything encouraged literal Cdc effective data? Would 5 years ago think? cannot build several thousand bed hospital, populate thousands doctors, nurses, technicians, etc., three weeks, let alone build staff hundred them. Nurses quitting due shitshow. least, ones still alive. remember USA 150k everyone freaking out. 9mil shops public transport, though rarely enforced either case. Everywhere u.s reduced rate transmission covid 2.5ish close 1. worst areas country aren’t getting higher 1.5, that’s usually short periods time. 

So, like u/to_the_past said, even though getting covid Rt 1, still half less normally without restrictions. Assuming mode transmission, bring flu Rt .65, squashing daily flu infections close zero “ It’s Fifteen cases number soon near zero” Lots things splattered across academic journals. single paper all. Jehovahs witness? Cause sounds familiar lol r/QAnonCasualties sewage PTSD though Ya mom lives outside Vegas hear hah looking, found yet. 


Any links? get it, work store people masks time wash hands times. Man that’s absolutely insane. think SD needs studied virus spreads rural areas. beginning whole pandemic theory ceiling many people infected according population density

For example NYC high percent population get infected lifestyle. Think it, normal subway ride work exposes hundreds “unique” people alone every day lot chance person exposed. 

Meanwhile theory rural areas limited spread isolated small cities/towns are. you’re rural area social bubble likely small. see people grocery, smaller payroll sizes companies mean fewer person person interaction, people rural areas stick single bar restaurant frequent someone city may go different one every time. SD completely blown theory water don’t even know anymore. 

If exceeded hospital capacity death rate would increase significantly many would survive treatment would die. half million cases one day way NHS could provide treatment hospitalised, let alone 1 million No. incite manslaughter. I’m advocating someone kill people. actual fact matter people die disease underlying health issues really old. Protect people let rest us live lives. far worse right stayed open things gas normal. put lots people work destroyed small business. Meanwhile countries lock fine.  kids, entire country I've seen several sources seem say kind preventative measures taken schools.

We've zero student cases little town Washington State screening EVERY student coming making student stay home additional days even test negative flu-like symptoms.

We also students wearing masks 6 feet apart classroom. reap sow mean even offers 10 percent protection, think that’s better nothing. seem little like umbrella fire hose. Especially small gatherings still permitted.  North Korea whole population lock covid released Chinese Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* ~110 days go 100 cases day zero, including spiking 700+ along way. 

3-4 weeks minimal impact Public service announcement, everyone wear diapers avoid spreading covid farthing! guess I’m old. didn’t learn year’s material year, well, held back. never ever repeated material year year. Gone days Americans could easily understand virus tracking rising case numbers back discrete sources — crowded factory, troubled nursing home, rowdy bar. Now, many cases, many places, many people coming frightening conclusion: idea virus spreading. one forces anyone pay taxes, sorry. optional. 

Seriously? pay taxes end jail, coincidentally would make slave.

How imprisoned something forcing someone something? exactly threat many forced laborers labor every day, saying forced, thus slavery.

That means seamen slaves choose jump overboard go jail.

Why changing stance middle key word forced labor forced.

You think that, ""do go jail"" forced something?

This needs distinction slavery forced labor. Going definition millions people meet criteria forced labor slaves according could choose go jail, beaten, lose family instead choice. Forced labor slavery can't get past dated views definitions slavery never end. part problem.

Again, definition broken see indentured servitude, debt bondage, etc forced labor, thus slaves.

***Both*** forced labor slavery need aggressively thoroughly addressed. saying forced labor jot forced labor makes harder get people help.

And again, done say forced labor forced labor denigrating suffering forced laborers endure millions world? restaurants bars hardly impact case numbers? hard disagree.  Ok hear out. Take kids work day, everyday👌 Thank logical. Sorry getting downvoted. Hello mother. Hello father. I'm camp corona. Sorry thought different sub. Well course. read kids daily. generation ago households could survive man’s income God sent virus. I'm USA, back shortages owner local pizza place giving away roll TP purchase large pie. thought pretty glorious, also ended eating lot pizza weeks shortage let up. Stop fucking lying misrepresenting WHO's use similar tests around number. That's planned second round tests next weekend. Obviously perfect, much better going full lockdown. see pays off.

Some numbers: testing costs around 100million euros, full lockdown would lose economy 100 million per day, good gamble. also lives saved way, goes without saying ""political""...it mentions 2 World leaders. Sweden much less **doing ok**

Those words. 

Noone jealous. Noone. horrifying happening there. People mainly worried someone try disastrous idea live.

I suspect France least, predictably disastrous results. cdc contact trace, WDHS investigation. notified 12 days onset symptoms tested whole camp 13 days getting involved, camp sick, kids parents already tested quarantined independently health dept investigation.

Does anyone read article anymore? doubt it. Poor compliance large segment population following advice very, different literally entire given population behaving much in, say February. ""Everyone's behaving pandemic"" valid complaint quite literally true pretty much anywhere.

Mobility still down, hand sanitisation social distancing up, peopl working home, mask wearing significantly up, large events drastically curtailed. every state.

Even people breaking loads restrictions choice follow lots people following following R number Covid well 3 pretty much everywhere, even places major surges Covid completely utterly control. Remember, takes bring R number flu 1.3 0.9. chaos control, feels good drove home townhouse I'm fixing today, roads packed kids done tonight. Fortunately, house set back road, houses it, one coming here. He’s global mascot right wing politics point. Yes. year hell grinds Brits told go home, stay home carry somehow. Absolutely brutal, necessary stem tide. much winning.. Love 61 cases freaking USA chugging along without care world Hey, finally, use term ""herd immunity"" actually means supposed to! We’ve already Easter, Mother’s Day, Memorial Day, Father’s Day, Independence Day, Labor Day. People assumed wouldn’t bad wrong. Fuck covid. Fuck Boris. Fuck everything! realistic scenario. highly controlled environment. people political stripes chose take pandemic seriously.

There people fall category one side aisle, though, following lead president. Fuck covid. Fuck Boris. Fuck everything also find really tragic much knowledge passes health care worker make home.

Its like people drop applications hospitals. Thats YEARS effort dreams, gone. Parents too. Merkel specifically mentioned domestic violence saying elementary school would stay open Germany. Trump's death rallies turned superspreader events? I'm shocked, shocked tell you. TIL sewage sometimes actually tested viruses, opposed bacteria alone. collect body, you? Nice. (Not really though) Negative???

You're dismissing difference 200 new cases 100,000. response shoudn't feeling numb outrage. expect that. ecobomy trashed, can't afford another lockdown. saw family today. outdoors masks on. see people! stay outdoors put mask. virus mutate quickly. wish people knew saw hug sign positivity race squander pandemic.

No, every single person (in U.S instance) access vaccine let's say March 2021, enough distribute front line workers, people nursing homes, 65/70, we're going start seeing tide change really fast. That's point curve ""flattening"" happens systemic, preventative lockdowns social distancing. Totally agree, thanks detailed reply. people took piss bit last time whole Cummings stuff chance! 

I work rural pub south east area strongly conservative also 80% brexit, give general idea clientele, vast majority anti lockdown intention completely isolating. I'm minority sure. said ignoring virus reaching herd immunity strategy. Since many people continue taking precautions avoiding virus, economy won’t recover we’d never reach herd immunity.

It seems we’ve reached impasse. It’s vaccine bust point. vaccine way ever end point. 22,000 positives 36.6% positive rate? That’s insane assume it’s ripping nearly everyone Poland right now. dissect find it. “During pandemic, think people Christmas gatherings?” 

Yes, want to. Believe not, everyone obese, 80+ years old, suffering cancer, would prefer lay around house alone seething jealously fact people enjoying themselves.

The people obsessed shaming people enjoying life ones life. real friends, poor relationships family. pandemic people spend time home gives chance revel fact normal people suffer existence do. bad, it’s going last forever, vaccine vaccine agree. early years (preschool kindergarten) socialization maybe missing effect parents provide social outlets-activities, playdates etc. missing year 1st 5th 6th grade going anything. There's much bullshit busywork years kids get anything of. Building diaramas useless projects, memorizing facts often rehashing things over. majority kids catch fine. think high schoolers could stay home. Teens cars jobs, get exposed bring school. Imagine parent could teach child read... go back generation kids knew read stepping foot school. Today much suspect cross immunity slowing would explosion zero immunity. first spreads community connected people, taking 3 months so. successfully hop. So, landed NY January, thereabouts, took 3 months obvious even politicans take note, wave number 2 June wave 3 September. Seems follow pattern note heavily hit areas seeing massive spikes, ""virgin territory"" speak, infection rate spikes hard.

Of course throw cooler weather historically helped viruses maybe even looks predictable. well sad One two people tens thousands becoming sick could possibly vaccine? hold moments silence anytime someone county passes. 


Its terrible, amount people lost far large comprehend. Nevada also meets every year. Remember school. ""UN Conspiracy"" contradiction itself?

... *You really think UN conspire get plan like together despite unable basically nigh-on anything else?* idiots good. inspire shows like Utopia. World would boring place without made sure restock that, food, couple weeks ago. Knew would coming. ""again"" imply stopped surging second time? stop first time? Almost sounds like hoping that.
Are you? can't claim China trying eradicated COVID somehow still outbreaks

Why? What's wrong ""trying"" ""is strategy""? less 5% world population. It'll follow exact lessons southern hemisphere. 3-4 weeks soft lockdowns. enough reduce daily numbers countries move hard lockdowns, others Argentina unending soft lockdown slows spread. 4 weeks obviously euphemism ""an indeterminate amount time."" Could be? Winter flu season close by, presumably likely case. Listen experts. think know better? make people ""feel better""

Are saying poorly fitted cloth mask actually protects virus? thing porous hell.

We're wearing N95 masks we? thing would actually offer degree protection. health insurances even cover vitamin testing. Sad. Governor Democrat running senate essentially ignoring numbers election... I’d love get testing too. that’s think positivity rate important right since tells best story compared overall number cases population adjusted cases. tests per 1000 super low right 1.3, east coast states 5-12 tests per 1000. I’d love state least week mass testing tune 10 per 1000 something get “real” positivity rate. 

There would two scenarios case. could show states low testing rate there’s actually many people test. case would see super low positivity rate like 1%. scenario would kept higher positivity rate 3-4% higher would mean aren’t good enough job testing. Hey u/AutoModerator
This reply incites manslaughter tens millions Americans. tells fuck off. going delete this? Fair enough. I've never live anywhere like that. live suburb smaller city get maybe 50 kids total entire night, 100 busy year. that's like 25 kids per hour. Basically never even bump anyone else, see house two away. Mathematically speaking , odds getting it? 

At rate, winter end? logic thing... jesus god god's sacrifice possible.

oh look, god loved us MUCH son (creation).  

that means something, mean anything corrupted thing keep saying true.  jesus piece god? that's god loved much?  pretty dumb... 

""believe saved"" that's ridiculous... actually good person.  ""believe"" something death. might hell though.  either way, believe. know agree US government beyond shit honestly think individuals go party disregard COVID you’re young healthy what’s giving virus power. majority people stupid missing something? Ah yes science fit narrative obviously wrong. November 5th know happen healthcare system overwhelmed collapses? 18-25 year old represent less 5% catching it. Did... Trump write it?!  strict 10 week lock Melbourne Australia got daily cases 700 zero, carefully opening Xmas Ehh, worked multiple restaurants would probably agree you. Unfortunately skirting laws probably second profitable area restaurant owners, namely labor laws.

Also restaurant jobs flow like water. like lose job stuck sending resumes months. spend day driving around likely something end it. Public Health England’s COVID-19 epidemiology surveillance summary show educational settings account 45 percent positive cases UK. highest level infection sector guess would 40% immunity number isn’t right (I’ve seen countless articles past couple months saying idea achieving herd immunity short time span isn’t thought feasible anymore). official covid numbers (and deaths) India may simply capture less infected population US Trump 300K covid19 deaths

vs 

Obama 1 Ebola death. 

&amp;#x200B;

He would hang wall.  don’t think know wrong. know feel vigilant. bot swinging time tell difference Britain England right? .3% people would die.... real number Black Plague either Seems like good common sense proposals. agree schools open wish government set kind national standard like left state see fit. reopened safeguards still haven’t reopened all. winter northern climes sun get much. UK government actually sent people observe testing Slovakia. I'd surprised less 2million americans die shielding?

(american here) Imagine asked USA lockdown unfortunately never happen. random chaotic real world deadly virulent pandemics emerge occasionally world. 
In world conspiracy evil guiding hand preferred totem make sense chaotic world. Even it’s evil, someone control making decisions, theorists —do something. Well... 80% compensation paid... maybe work. genuinely embarrassing. level entitlement people ridiculous. first wave went unbelievably well Slovakia (best whole Europe, looking deaths per capita - 25 / 5.5mil), second wave ramping really heavily total lockdown way stop it. know people determined shit success story. Regardless, maybe come back, maybe - we're going lot precautions. Even come back, it'll much smaller numbers we'll able get top again. mean time society able live lives without hanging heads, economic recovery head start much world. even isolate 60% asymptomatic people covid spread virus further, huge success help health care system immensely 'would have', never 'would of'.

Rejoice, blessed CouldWouldShouldBot! see worked hard prick though well done Trump figured way solve housing homeless crisis one go.... Yeah, time vote away guy listen science. please stay home tonight! Cancel trick-or-treating. pandemic that's dumb. next year. live too, ruin me! Oh, good. Finally something DC help. Inadvertently, counts point!! Germany trying spiking Im RN covid unit Florida.

Really weird weekend election, suddenly covid section empty shut down.

Then read headlines like this. Strange indeed. Peculiar timing. Masks enforced, recommended guidelines. lot non compliance. common ""No asthma"". super frustrating leaves feeling furious mask thinking ""Oh cool, I"". full info:
The ny times referring dutch article describing 2 IC patients flown german happens frequently

dec2019: 9 hospitalized children flown belgian hospitals (cold/flu virus downplaying anything here

i want generally remind keep numbers events relation past instead getting panicked Ah cool. Yeah wondering. similar lifestyle except shop grocery store cheaper delivery. leave house probably 3-4 times per week, exercise get groceries every 10 days. That's wondering even possible isolate much here’s BLM protest vs recent Trump Rally, tell people wearing masks long money they're good Japan run money they'll become burden Japan. Japan nowhere put them. mean says 2.2 million dead general time pandemics run full course, make mistake that’s certainly still possible. mention now, October/November 2020 Article paywalled. Relocation patients hospitals Germany even, allows hospitals provide healthcare anyone needs it. Hardly collapse. Also far ideal, calling strikt measures relieve doctors nurses asap. nothing apocalyptic Deferred car payments + gas likely around 20% lot people yeah. know anyone personally gotten sick yet.

I would wager people know anyone anything serious flu. Even cancer relatively rare know.

If Covid left unchecked measures put place, millions US alone would die. easy thing consider ""serious"". According npr, “health experts say current increase driven large part people don’t schools need income students moving halls plus tuition. 

This isn’t simple case testing = positives. Deaths general rising. track way higher. end day continue socialize like nothing happened government do. government essentially paid people stay home. rather, removed financial need go work.

Small businesses lost certain amount revenue given 10-20k grants government. Closed businesses whose revenue dropped wanted retain employees could place employees onto Jobkeeper program government basically pays wages. work - apply Jobseeker program. pay $1500 fortnight individual. place since April. alex jones answer ""they"" group technocratic globalists carrying millenia long line human/child sacrifice associated almost ancient cultures participated ritual human sacrifice, people throughout millenia influenced ""dark force"" often implied literal demons satan himself, force utilize life energy sacrificed people, innocent children best - thats abortion plays conspiracy - medicalized child sacrifice appease satan. 

these satanist globalists interfacing interdimensional entities, also implied demons satan, using DMT, ""meetings"" entities DMT, globalist cabal given world technology, told need depopulate planet small number elites finally achieve transhumanist singularity - merging machines become ""AI gods"".

but never become AI gods, tricked great deceiver - satan, destroying gods creation completing whatever satans master plan bible is. 

to goals use pedophile blackmail rings control politicians...the epstien situation conspiracy theory tip huge iceberg pedophile blackmail rings control prominent democrats neocons, whole thing somehow associated UN communist china, trying break american economy via things like covid lockdowns carbon taxes expidite social breakdown implementation hard kill population control methods.

vaccines, chemtrails gmo's other, similar conspiracies tie also - soft kill population control methods, slowly kill begin population control able take total social control open. 

in way another conspiracies tied base conspiracy - things alledged hurt soft kill population control methods, state national political groups governments disagree tied mid-teir cabal democrat politicians, communist china UN ""hate america"" working destroy it, global groups/historical secret societies combined revelations type stuff form motivation stuff orbiting around central satanist/pedophile conspiracies origins thousands years old theory ""blood libel"" need test eyes? fines quite severe police appeared enforcing (except retroactively). Australia also paid everyone stay home. Apparently antibodies last long herd immunity question. Except lockdown. schools, main vector infection, staying open. 🤦‍♀️ then...How Americans cope English actors actresseseeses TV soap operas next year? Earth 7 billion people. Math adding right. fair depiction.

It's widely discussed Cummings effect Boris's boss. literally course, he's powerful chief advisor (itself new position) directed vote leave largely responsible campaign's success data post-truth strategy.

On top that, led push ""herd-immunity"" approach COVID, spite advice lead scientists. Even strategy work, heartless sentence large section population death sake stock market.

He effective hands pie comes anything British politics. Think competent, yet equally sinister, Jared Kushner.

Even think comment hyperbolic, not, acknowledge fact Johnson's firing Cummings would PR slam dunk. would shown no-one law reinforced together spirit held COVID.

The fact Johnson fire him, even Cummings' horseshit justification, shows taking political hit far less important losing him. Really weird weekend election, covid section empty shut hospital. Haha! panic bought toilet paper weeks ago! Australia China also went winter virus already. China waterpark open 30,000 people social distancing masks months ago nothing happened.

It's possible control virus vaccine available. countries shitty healthcare response governments cripple it. still go Barnard Castle? ever feel like people think exponential math like magical thing doesn’t exist should! actual reasonable response this. well there. probably right call?

Maybe terms getting rid covid, months years come, could pyrrhic victory take account destruction small businesses, cafes, restaurants, exacerbation mental illness/distress, children development.

We see. thats spreading virus works sure buddy People exhibit symptoms still infect people. issue virus people spreading infection wildly.

The problem Covid kills everyone infects, problem infects lot people. We'll continue get 80% pay every month since March nice employer like they'll top 100%. great take away travel expenses scheme best I've ever get 50% normal workload due restrictions. industry also seen 70% rise profit covid - work beverage industry. Provided white collar worker. Everyone else crack take chances.... ain't good. shot for, exactly wanted. 

They want lockdown. want complying people. still trying herd immunity, get say there's lockdown, people comply Cummings blame people wring hands all. took covid see that? You’d think people would’ve caught spent years talking moon landing fake students moving halls, would lock schools.

More testing = positives know we're pretty divided Reddit least agree right? mean literally president's doctor gave Vitamin hospital Covid. brainer cheap way fight pandemic. state went 14 day lock yesterday.  
Almost everything closed.  

since governor outspoken opponent president, even threatening secesion week due lack federal aid, red button lock negatively received.


The city looks like Legend: Tapatío edition Remember China knew abt virus said everything control... society culture construct. 

Really can't ethically take humans society/culture observe behavior blind test, nearly impossible know. Yeah bro lol here’s model Hillsdale mouthpiece orange disaster. It’s chief get humanity so... Dumb? Selfish? get it. era much info readily available, yet agree you. long still wear masks read Dan Jones Peasant Revolt lockdown interesting read. first time I've gotten reference 1381 otherwise got.

All useless you, hope good day.

Oh fuck Queen think cultures make golden calf individual ""freedom"" need take good long look values. Grocery shopping 1 person per household allowed go supermarket per day.

Personally click collect groceries basically ordering everything online, supermarket staff walk around gather shopping me. drive load groceries car me.

As people incentivised comply, massive fines ($5000) so. curfew rules like cannot travel 5km home without permitted reason made easier police observe non-compliance.

Lock skeptics encouraged egged media, largely dominated right wing interests. Fortunately left wing govt really care police constantly deployed people went protested (protesting one permitted reasons out).

The big stick approach led Premier called ""dictator"" again- right wing politicians right wing media.

I think there's really many ways solve without depriving people ""rights"". sounds promising.  moron. That's all. Yes know usually dont opportunity either adding vitamin bread probably wont much, let alone able afford multivitamins. Dont try argue people, insane lol never legitimate models showing 2 million dead now. 2 million dead 1 year however especially Trump remains President possible BC playing games. Egos getting way public safety. Thanks, did, worthless Reddit pundit. I’m glad don’t live America true hurts. lmao, gotta California, Oregon, Washington state fueling Agreed, tried reset case number months Care elaborate? Keep mind doesn’t specify asymptomatic pre-symptomatic. transmit virus either symptoms mild symptoms. Please win Tuesday! track trace allowed us localised lockdown rather national one. Also, borders states closed (or partially closed) prevents spread. no, England. They’ll accuse Labour subversive anti-semitic plot. Moral story? Life finally justifying making antisocial hermit. I've practiced 2020 whole life. think replied wrong comment... Essential workers harmed casedemic. Due indirect angle sun's Ray's, uv needed produce vitamin low winter. Great quote Well imagine flu deaths normal, Covid deaths would exponentially higher without measures. It’s also closer 50,000. actual flu season hits. 50,000 preventable deaths far. 

It’s difficult understand. 

If think tories would destroy economy reason. You’re idiot. Tories hard right economically. actually responding can't. That's found odd mentioned first place, realize think through. Better luck next time guess.  didn’t consult elderly anyone infected. want keep fear mongering causing mass hysteria “Hmm, something going camp pandemic doesn’t seem right...anyone agree?”
“What chances anyone dies it? They’re old people. It’ll fine.” Lol - nailed it!  I'm sorry lost family friend agree Govt accountability held scrutiny. (Australia) were/are encouraged support local business case dining used either 'contact-free delivery' 'click collect' (also contact-free). Even 'lockdown' many restaurants spread fewer tables/chairs others taped cannot used. hope politicians understand blood hands  Yes, flatten curve infection rates overwhelming amount, would drastically higher effect deaths healthcare resources. ignorant love disregard things jive made world view. classic example. circuit breaker probably dumbest harmful strategy. What’s plan effective safe vaccine couldn’t found? coming still going least year heard immunity reached Yeah lets grateful March-June-ish nothing Nah, giving big cheque hotel owners Tory donors saving hassle whole middle bit. Due indirect angle sun's Ray's, uv needed produce vitamin low winter. I'm Australia many mistakes made full blown incompetence. UK never got hundred daily cases reopening. good enough.

I believe EU continual lockdown unless agreement made temporarily close borders national lockdown reopen country almost 0 cases. good news highly unlikely die. Hellz yeah let’s shut again. not? journalism. describing whats going world. yes hospitals full countries struggling. thats reality. hence article.

only downside : putting context past states allow standing orders pharmacies administer pneumonia vaccine (along others) without prescription. long patient meets ACIP Vaccine recommendations. People dont problem number 400? covered clothing. face really exposed. supposed Russian asset right? UK Europe chaos Brexit soon make Russians think yeah democracy sucks lets stick Vlad. ok Sorry anger issues. Hope better day tomorrow. mean die Covid cold corpses spread sure. would've got crucified support base Telegraph Spectator taken early action avoided crisis. would said unnecessary. Also get necessary medical dental appointments can't done remotely. went dentist day, receptionists wearing masks. Neither patients waiting room. fine. Utahn here. governer fucking asshole idiot. keeps giving COVID stink eye really thinks he's making difference. 

Meanwhile, hospitals overrun anti mask crowd thinks funny. allowed harbor fugatives example.

That's totally fugazi None true WTF, pangolin real thing? thought South Park made Victoria lockdown gone 700 cases day 3 days past week deaths new cases. right Medical debt get passed family. developing countries, people get milk milk shops opposed cartons grocery stores. basically plastic bag cow milk it; processed way. sterilize boiling drink all. Vitaman D!? Democrat!? Coincidence!? think so! whole? No. 

Looking Europe, considering already hit 100k day November, can’t help think tighter restrictions implemented areas stop hospitals overrun. got chiggers That’s great. idea wrote article then. still get worse; think New Jersey peaked 300 day population. Belgium too. NHS providing hotel accommodation staff difficulty travelling work valid reasons (at least London). Everyone knew used commuting fair way away London normal trains cancelled. 
Not working London spike, hopefully keep up, expand least mentioned Hmm, interesting. say hard get alimony days, makes way? politicians wearing mask seen ""weak"" even second wave states. one big storm surge. show signs receding. could pandemic didn’t exist time election. wasn’t relevant. WINNING confession Trump administration strategy admired. None cases fatal even serious, CDC reported, one hospitalized. mean another option? Cant(shouldnt) keep kid home reason keeping schools open closed would damaging child. 

So option would remove child home stay family member. 

(Hopefully didnt sound argumentative 😂) Probably not. vast majority skirt around rules still try book holidays Málaga. play places visit, museums, movies, malls

what think lockdown is? worries! upvoted you. think numbers really hard grasp without reference, med numbers kind insane.

Another way see it: usually work 50-60 hours week study another 15-20 hours top. me, that's pretty good! much better doctors US. work got bit busier work extra hour everyday...I would probably combust month that. would feel? American, comment infuriating comforting. possible, unless leader calls fake. gets it. gets experimental treatments, pretends ain't thang, goes back holding rallies thousands people think masks thing. 

Let's listen WHO. Cause, like, spent lives studying shit. Lockdowns solution, they're safety measure. lockdown Jack shit go back normal life right after. 

Don't let leaders hook. There's reason they're position are. think lead. don't, people die. I'm coming visit.

Yours truly,

All Europe North America seems like well organised party warehouse. I'm really curious kind music scene whatever was. Good. Kids need education Sherrifs eat 20% donuts  Prove opposite, good luck. That's true, towns cities can't reliably keep 1-2 metres people pavements. sun weaker way affects Vit production(I'm Southern United Statesean, please forgive lack education)??? referring shining less hours? what's point? close libraries schools book stores laboratories small-time retail (just time Holidays), people respond spending time friends (inside now) scheduling playdates (or even child rotation schedules people keep working), screwed economy without benefit public health.

No, ignorant fucks refuse isolate ones fucking economy reason. pathetic ignorance. goddamn adult. would lovely outcome past 5 years flu deaths UK around 18.000 

This year wore face masks washed hands, dropped 400 deaths.

And covid killed around 20,000

So overall death rate years 

But reason destroy economy peoples lives people involved, better chance something leaking. bot writes comments here? strong suspicion people responsible ones refusing wear masks... Yeah regardless comment first thing would close. would entitled certain share household assets

Unless married multi-millionaire much. Even always entitled everything. state, anything owned marriage ""community property."" means spouse would enlisted it. least portion ""lost income"" 

No. completely false. hard get alimony 
days. 

My aunt married uncle 40+ years. thing got house. work 40-year marriage. Everything else name only. Stupidity selfishness play part, however it’s everything. Pandemic fatigue real thing. think experiencing it. I’m fairly rational disciplined person put mind towards something know true right. Even then, think holidays coming try rationalize something shouldn’t okay. Human beings social emotional. It’s tough thing everybody right now. Protesters get covid. Lol. fail, idea 2 large corporations sphere. Two large supermarket brands pubs restaurants etc that's part makes absolute least sense. depopulation, least lethal children lethal people likely bunch grandchildren making babies? gives scope justifying wanted first place. vaccine. Well obviously not, tourism accounts decent sized heap economy jobs. UK 10th biggest tourist destination. Tourism fastest growing industry United Kingdom expected grow 3.8% annually 2025, 0.5% higher global average, responsible 10% thank he's older keeping others safe I’m kinda surprised anyone broke ranks, it’s pretty obvious there’s blood water White Supremacy House. isn’t real. “per capita” round ups paint picture, come on, Belgium tiny compared USA... there’s gotta line round ups useless think one crossed it. amazing people get this. boycott weathermen whenever forecast come true? Models finite may always accurate change depending variables. mean model fake, lies, misleading. economy collapse people sick dying? Cool, use bones pass costume next year? could casino longer every game every 2 games shut off, dont mandatory mask wearing employee patrons, fact gamblers going church packed ""God said fake"", people go church jobs week spread wear mask, lack mask wearing enforcement whole, proper washing hands, antibacterial sanitizer leadership federal level state level.

Yeah fucking idea numbers rising folks cant figure getting it. 

I mask everytime out, wash hands frequently, use sanitizer time. worry wife immune system compromised RA/Lupus producing white blood cells, yet work to. contact unwashed ignorant public. 

So drastic changes put place, Americans continue fucking go ""Why spreading, thought gonna Nov 3. etc etc"" yet worry themselves. 

Makes sad could curtailed quality leadership smart educated people making decisions. stop experimenting viruses longer endemic anywhere? seems ludicrous.  Looking forward flood apologies right COVID disappear Wednesday. Leader nation said corner rounded positive way. spite word still counts lot many people, especially Utah people. good idea protesting prevents people somehow maintaining distance complete lie. argument people making. Protest heart's content!!! mean mass gathering without distance ok. Good god WHAT.

Man glad sensible state. ... idiots. France; I'm sincerely sure called ""lockdown"". Nah. 2 weeks month ahead time schools re-opened. we're half way 2 week lag deaths start ticking wayyyy up. next week time. Oh, get it. guy sitting row flight I’m sleeping away mask eyes mouth clearly not. moment germany needs 10 days double cases guess wait long new big records New York’s hottest club Covid way happen Congress passes martial law, given environment America moment, welcome Civil War Part 2  Spring 2021 mass distribution expected underway. it’ll likely high risk frontline workers like first responders doctors Colder months people get colds, flus
“Omg COVID cases going up” lol. ain’t worn single mask followed rules like sheep people are. I’ve done lot travelling supposed to, go shopping regularly, go gym, please tell absolutely exaggerated epidemic virus death destruction I’m still okay?

Oh yeah, maybe coz entire thing farce. yeah saying literally one died COVID. Funny include “deaths reason within 28 days testing positive”. Someone could get hit bus would marked death covid. people stupid weak realise that, keep watching news media swallow fear. thought atm. USA still riding d614g, Europe new clade Spain. necessarily, cases area people going catch even unavoidable contact people. pretty much took bus work went grocery store couple times 2 weeks caught it. idea passed me. common cold rhinoviruses coronaviruses, influenza. Completely different, attenuated.  Hopefully enough stopgap measure get vaccine. don’t think overall enforcement good earlier year. winning understand everyone die fat? fat black people live urban areas. Easier catch virus. fat white people live rural areas. Black Americans higher rates diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, etc. makes average susceptible dieing covid. crazy lump schools universities together.

 Young kids basically parents say move limited circles within school. 

University students, hand, travel widely, move widely different social groups attend classes socialise, drink make silly decisions ( criticism - fondly remembered reality me) likely mild asymptomatic illnesses spread unknowingly. think universities first close, crazy consider schools.

 Even schools treated differently depending age kids. already many families lost someone year. people would stop *selfish* wear mask, would over! ""European Country X going back lockdown resurgences cases/deaths""! Yeah. Aussies aren’t like that. He's immune; he's asymptomatic superspreading asshole. Fuck you, Nico! someone trial, idea got vaccine placebo.  much doubt results yet. medocal professionals taken surprise Covid point? Selfish Hoerdes :@ Deplorable actions people. Yep, awful indeed, 712/million, US death rate even close Belgium's, they're 987/million! Belgium become first nation world 1,000 deaths per million way! Couldn’t happened isolating house spring summer!!?? realize collectively money Solomon could ride six freaking weeks whenever choose to, right? fat asses take care. Simple stuff. reduce domestic violence tho really distinction places big outbreaks places well contained.

When people discretion opt what's convenient. People excuse ""forget"" it. going walk, decided stop store. They'll ""only minute"".

Everyone feels exception, everyone excuse.

Which ultimately leads outbreak. Yes I'm you. ideal, think ways good setup. 

You took bunch lowest risk individuals, allowed get sick away rest society, reintegrate clear antibodies. kids less likely vectors spread schools infecting parents. Also unlike school teachers, summer camp counselors younger much less likely risk category. 
If kid health concerns probably going camp year first place. It’s virus already present parts country. infected travellers won’t make much difference, especially isolating travel. Plus think stored fat cells technically also potential storage capacity. snitch? Unacceptable. Lockdown vaccine may may soon ever non-solution. genuinely hope refuse America. Without additional financial support State Buisnesses/Civilians, (of Congress pretty much gave us middle finger) hard lockdown reasonable compliance feasible. Almost assuredly, protests worse likely result. Options slim unless wish use force. sub died. aggressive auto mod. Vote Blue way. free government tyranny? power stop growing? decide fight it? Widespread economic damage avoidable outcome lockdowns. Governments decide make payments businesses individuals mitigate harms seen. decision quite separate imposition shutdowns.

There plausible arguments lockdowns economic compensation would less economic damage shutting down. U.S. U.K. economic activity suffered months diminished economic activity driven people limiting activity lower odds becoming infected SARS-Cov-2.

In reaction economic impact pandemic Jerome Powell (Chairman U.S. Federal Reserve) Mervyn King (former Governor Bank England) others encouraged policy makers expand government spending consider monetizing expenditure. Virus also pro-abortion. That’s swerve right past protestors lmao. Reminds firefighters cause buildings catch fire - they're always seen together. mean, people dying outside hospitals far beyond capacity care them. army medic 6 years can't imagine health care workers making this. working endlessly, president take seriously. Must incredibly frustrating difficult them. Poverty rates great confounding variable here. amazing often think genetic biological, turns environmental nature.

For example everyone thought kids can't get spread COVID due biological differences, is, put back school social settings saw kick infection clusters. totally agrree think ship sailed. literally military occupation ton rural areas get compliance. Agreed completely 

It’s also gun bans 100% invalid you, though? You’d think people would moved Indiana even pandemic well said. think lot people will. people know already made plans spend Christmas normal).

I agree lot people, possibly most, rebel want. people unfortunately continue suffer more.

There's large margin people anxious, vulnerable friends family, etc. swayed one way other.

In case think there's fine line tread pushing country civil disorder vs saving lives preventing infrastructure collapse. Democracy must foreign quite bit lower last week. much testing? Go get check up. Hospitals struggling clinics normal. I've gone doctor five times since pandemic started. Also virtual appointments. Masks help prevent catching it’s 100% effective. Way way lower going maskless, happen. sorry caught it- wish virus could pick taking seriously wasn’t spare cautious. live virus *very low levels* first. US trajectory like Iran's weeks delayed.

It's road want go we're gas brakes. Let sink in: WW II deaths deaths young men 20's shot bombed death, know average death Virus??  do, lock again! Hopefully faster time!

This news. We've known start lockdowns effective when, know, active. moment lift lockdown, cases come rising back again. 

For reason, ideally *we lock effective vaccine treatment widely available*. Except, that's feasible government policy, especially developed countries like UK. 

Therefore, alternating ""on-off"" ""circuit-breaker"" strategy efficient solution, provided done right. *essential* periods ""respite"" shorter periods lockdown, lockdown goes right back place *second* cases rise certain amount. *they* *the people*? people get decide UK? US people going go make ""point"". Maybe pros outweigh cons. Letting parents work can’t work home provide income letting children get education mental well being. long schools strict Covid prevention protocols course. would want schoolteacher times. It’s nerve wracking teachers died, though don’t know got school. Cough ** Weekend Cough ** 2 weeks?! like Texas.  live London like least left uni. Sad hear changed, even situation is. better now, can't get supermarkets maskless. definitely ""that bad"" It’s called adding context. WW II deaths young men 20's whole lives ahead blows mind. Riots masks Europe? expect stupid shit fellow muricans... lovely going running gotta learn live it. It’s Australia. idiots protested white right wing believe it’s conspiracy. opened first Mariner Jack shop selling beard care range, 2 weeks ago Cornwall.

If lockdown, gunna even discussing increasing u employment checks people like works hospitality buisness gets check ensure rent paid

Im 10000% pro science, thus pro lockdown lockdown without government help would kill vast majority americans. (Instead virus, get thrown live street) require written proof negative test timestamp? probably easy forge it’s hell lot better relying honor system. means even majority agrees it, won’t abide keeping infection active among keep socializing. end isolation period, it’ll pick again. would act momentary pause best although help flatten curve give hospitals reprieve large influx patients severe care needs. realize people need money survive, right?

That's reasonable. Thank ! Unfortunately, obliviousness good diet/vitamins minerals really widespread. yes, balanced diet get expensive.  Good point. it’s question, I’ll answer. 

Wrong. 

UK part Europe, part EU. 

Europe made 49 countries 27 part EU hospitals get overwhelmed almost states simultaneously likely scenerio happens. April inevitable would fucked across nation shutdown. becomes likely yeah. could 5k deaths day, hospitals overwhelmed nothings going happen truth widely admitted amongst scientific community, morons make lot noises Internet say otherwise.

Do think completely independent scientific committees many countries world would end bad conclusion fake exaggerated, one independently fool government creating economic crisis trying mitigate death toll?

The surge cases mean something. course one part due testing way April. Probably, testing capacity April, would back something like 300,000 cases per day US. cases indeed spiking we'll see results death count one month. Two weeks go hospital, two weeks die.

And deaths already started rise. See deaths European Union. assure 1500 death per day nothing. tragedy. Never long history wars Europe that. need get back great plagues. That's difference ""soft"" lockdown ""hard"" lockdown. Right. least controversial thing said cases continue soar. hit 100,000 new cases one day week, right, cases suddenly stop increasing holidays winter! Federal government power shutdowns. You’ll see localized shutdowns if/when hospitals start overflow, assuming can’t expand. initial thought reading title boom crystal meth use. picky 20% cut. 80%. enough scrape longer paying commute yes still enough. North feel like twat sometimes wearing mask. quite bizarre works. still it... jesus like rest creations god. angels beginning. stop...  

everything posting says opposite imply... john 3:16 lol confirm - hit sorts asking customers masks, make sure me. Frustratingly seal borders states well country. Military checkpoints allow trucks through. Wow! half (normal) capacity taken covid patients? That’s terrifying, even 9k, course reasons ICU. bet it'll sooner summer. 50. guess depends grandparents dead long born. That’s flu isn’t viral social distances masks shutting number down.

Occam’s Razor uk celebrate? make gummy vitamin D. 
First result google amazon one, $16 60 days worth vitamin D3 (2 gummies per day). Pretty much every time I’ve sick life, I’ve wondered “how catch this? get damn virus?”

I’ve never able answer question. never clear incident encounter left thinking “oh, bet I’ll get cold now.” US. Guardian based UK, US edition (which cited above). know UK. supplement milk, find odd. Maybe one friends across pond enlighten us. Welcome Reddit. strangers randoms go online speculate make observations. arresting people popping road see mum good idea? I’ll still working building site 100 people going Tesco 200 people. wrong. 60% symptomatic based current did. wife rarely colds til kids school, regular clockwork, every September, colds. realize valid research paper school = everyone getting colds fairly well known phenomenon. gets approved another country, US approve that’s whataboutism. Learn evolve.. mean advocating mask, social distance, avoid crowds indefinitely? Get kids back school throw away masks people get vaccinated. Easily spooked pro-lockdowners seal away, best worlds. Yea, lot levels law enforcement Texas too. even mention things like Constables, generally serve warrants. Department Public Safety, pretty much whatever want, wherever want. Texas Rangers division DPS, investigates police. CDC Adults need pneumonia vaccine - Dr prescription reuqired states far know even meet think intimidate somehow job - virus go away? like blaming weather reporter blizzard. Vaccine daydream Boris Johnson, radical leftist, tries undermine Trump campaign. Wait wut?  You’re supposed wear mask car drive through? yes states require one ask primary care dr get one. need 65 certain health conditions though practioner might willing still prescribe one regularly get upper respiratory illnesses. Dr willing get everything comes along previously ended ER bacterial pneumonia.

this year MD going check MMR titers get booster low since i'm age group people got one shot kid &amp; never illnesses. MMR studied see helps prevent least reduce severity covid19 stimulates immue system general Yup. That's expect virus among population. Glad science working here.

I wonder CDC traced outbreak back families communities see true impact. one spreading event allow risk population artificially kept together via camp. looks like quarantined everyone could head home prevent spreading among families? case, glad CDC enforce keep coming home spreading among higher risk populations. actually tried something order fail. can't jailed escaping slavery. 

And country referring to? well hundred, would case would go front UN human rights counsel. pain? Yes, international law treaties force people labor.

Again, lol. idea rampant real slave forced labor is, little done it.  Big number syndrom UK combination meeting educational needs children, safeguarding vulnerable, enabling working parents carry working. Homeschooling common thing here. government made keeping schools colleges/unis open top priority, protecting NHS far I'm aware people agreement. certainly am, children left now. happen locked states. 
Health care FL, NY,AZ,TX collapse. held importing professionals many states military. states strain riseing infections exactly imagine people going come take gap? Someone thanks service. 100% agree. sides proverbial aisle. Unfortunately, last years proven system broken. hypocrisy astounding. honestly worried “retaliation” Democratic President Congress. Checks balances damned. scary times country. overwhelming feeling complacency tremendously worrisome. wave 1 right? 29 Million go.  cares act worth $18,000 per person inUs. People got $1200 rest partly mismanaged. given people said stay home, would light years ahead now. funny believe Jesus rose dead want ton evidence Covid exists seen 2 3 people get it. Vietnam win fighting everything though simply yet another instance lazy, ill-informed, poorly supported generally shitty ""East vs. West"" narrative completely fails understand huge complexity issue. makes nice sensationalist clickbait-y title great sub.

Approaches US, Germany, Italy, Greece Denmark SUBSTANTIALLY different other. like Taiwan, South Korea, Australia Japan. Yet get grouped together generic ""West"" ""East"" crap mean anything.

Not that, mostly based current level cases, already know change rapidly. e.g. ^ likely future. Probably helped vaccine, sounds like around time tail likely starts occur (I predict spring) I'm mod squad Texas CV sub. Whenever someone asks mentions ""lockdown"" -- non-essential businesses closed, wink-wink-nudge-nudge list ""essential"" businesses page long -- contrast France conducted lockdown.

No businesses allowed open except groceries, drugstores medical care providers. Nobody allowed work, except first responders staff allowed businesses. Nobody allowed outside, except work allowed job, seek medical attention, shop food meds. Leave home non-allowed reason -- get socked several-100-euros fine.

By standard, I'm pretty sure we've never lockdown anywhere U.S. ""BuT mAh FrEeDoMs"" crowd would gone completely bonkers People would like err side recklessness, caution. say schools want 17 peer reviewed journals PROVE it, otherwise assume (LOL) kids spread disease proven otherwise. 

Exact opposite caution. basically viral load. longer sick, likely infect others. Day 1 infected contagious Day 2, 3, 4 etc virus replicating longer infected.

So, single individual might get sick in, say, 10 days infect mom really sick mom caring checking more. Mom got Dad sick Day 5 kept going work Asymptomatic. whole family Positive need keep going Grocery store Dad goes he's less-sick person. Day 20 kids getting better mom's really tough time sister decides come visit her.

So basically infections start right away, *spread* infection takes time person came contact someone infected throughout duration getting ready start multi-week sickness they'll likely also infect others get sicker.

Then, people get infected, people infect kinda long arching cycle. What's point? Nothing change one month. That's interesting take wrote. think high risk people hesitant taking vaccine? say know true. assuming high risk people get vaccine? 

Here's problem - remember let say 50% effective. assume something know yet - get vaccine get virus, get sick die. (We vaccine track record, right? let's assume something like flu vaccine.)  Every person 50 gets vaccine. people 50 don't, people still get it.  Possibly thw elderlybjust get sick, die, similar profile younger people.

And issue thinking society, whole, cohort. Two problems, first assuming get sick die this. lower probability, risk. get it, matter percentage is, got 100% time. Second, would good think society whole. ""resisting arrest"" police report ""innocent actual crimes"" just, fyi least know dangerous?

Looking bright side /s False. Th depopulation plan already place implementing higher cost living people can’t afford children. city city basis much. Cleveland, OH, several major world leading hospitals, like, 2 months less 15 cases per day population 340000. city schools stayed closed, suburban ones opened. first, spike, state surged like crazy, Cleveland 82 cases today. need countrywide, least culture wide attitude shift US. Argh!! pesky edit function! Communism works answering post:

Speaking guy never wanted children never get closer baby ""my arm plus TV remote controler. case extend arms time"".

I ensure 2 childs best thing ever happened me, really extend sorrow never find dad means.

Back point comment:

Before dad opinion you. 

After dad opinion people children fucking idea talking about. Yeah, gradually decrease zero, downward trajectory, society start opening back need nearly stringent nonpharmaceutical interventions. long R less one, given case replaced new case average. tHaT's gOd'S pLaN tHo!!!!! /s 5% case fatality rate, 5% infection fatality rate. missed cases March April something approaching order magnitude may missing majority right now. 0.6-1.3% death rate (with hospital care) still pretty steep especially lot people get infected time something spreads easier flu. Thank much. you. :(  Gotcha stay safe. isn’t flu tho. 

Covid-19 also contagious presymtomatic people (unlike flu), addition far contagious flu. 

We never actually flattened curve sustainable way US. [We’ve heightening peaks year, discernable Trump administration royally fucked national response, state local governments performed much better. deeper issue USA putting profit lives, matter social cost. simple version claim capable suppressing information viral outbreak would effect millions people, yet time even hide camps even though remote part country far tighter controlled provinces. Makes zero sense. might be, might be. That's whole fucking point. Sorry stupid closed minded understand that.

The machismo people embarrassing. becaue country incompetent mean others same. Trump says stupid things do

In pandemic that's literally worst thing.

Singapore initial advice Fauci/the CDC recommending masks symptoms. evidence came prevalence asymptomatic spread, Singapore's Ministry Health Fauci/the CDC changed recommendations everyone wear masks.

The difference Singaporean leaders acted decisively, implemented mask mandate led example wearing masks rather consistently undermine health experts downplay severity outbreak. also gave masks every citizen. Contrast Trump refused wear mask scrapped plan April send mask everyone.

Saying stupid things profound impact, makes Trump much worse incredibly high volume stupid things says. least nine people officials described party organizers charged multiple misdemeanors health violations, officials. 

Some party attendees charged resisting arrest, disorderly conduct, violating orders banning mass gatherings. county doubt learned thing. I'm red rural county California maybe 30 cases. They're pissed Gavin Newsom they're outside grocery stores shaking hands smoking cigarettes. neither political lockdown, financially viable. may see cities US lockdown (although El Paso told legally can’t), without bailouts stimulus, states want millions people people furloughed again. 

Not mention impending rent crisis, people owing 6 months worth back rent that...I guess...they may pay? Eventually? even Cuomo seems addressing future. 

If WH strategy herd immunity, found effective way force us (no stimulus bail out). Slimy bastards Well, hyperbole aside, world works. Start ignoring bosses orders see long last. end day, need money put roof heads food table. economy, good luck standing principles. Principles luxury everyone afford, sure look good behind keyboard. That's literally thinking. going see anti-vax documentary post pandemic gonna downplay pandemic saying kill anyone listing hundreds thousands deaths vaccine. Go Taiwan 🇹🇼

Taiwan’s front beginning. know H1N1 kids spread flu sleep away camps. 

NY banned sleep away camps April reason, allowed day camp. 

Wisconsin give shit, want. insane infection rate.

And Illinois getting hit bad even though really trying. Thanks Wisconsin. Lockdowns cannot stop virus lead another surge, exactly seeing right now, proven recent statistics proving right front eyes. Even herd immunity really viable, proof viable all, speculation people. One thing herd immunity works past pandemics, stats hugely favor herd immunity restrictions, fact way work anything infection rate least higher seasonal flu. might might work time lockdown already failed miserably European countries, speculation, really fail super hard once. Every normal person go safer approach, lockdowns. Seriously dude family Bozeman, Missoula, Hamilton, White Sulfur Springs, even fucking Roundup yeah corona real finally arrived great frontier. I'd interested guy (claims be) from. think beat British individuals? Oh god, we're screwed. Looking comments, I'm sure people joking legitimately people going look think movie trailer canary coal mine telling us things come.

Especially Biden wins tried kind additional containment. I'm sick tired people. fuck Micheal Bay anyone else involved project inevitable amping fear government take life.  Arguably disproportionately affect certain groups, like lack empathy others, poor reasoning skills, reject making sacrifices greater good. sure effect strong. affecting people secondary medical issues. also disproportionately affects cultures value personal independence social sacrifice. true. Population density porous borders make enormous difference.

But West, trying anything considered right thing.  I'm also 80's kids. vividly remember told church, adults discussing, UN ""one world government"" part end times. taking super long time carry plan. members former church passed away still waiting eagerly apocalypse. Yes. Schools huge part upbringing. wife healthcare cannot bring work. also tons lower income households rely schools meals, safety, more. Many privilege choice Fun calculator: 21915/1011660 0.046 aka 4.6% infected, die. got right? slipped decimal point? ~5% death rate would pretty steep... Buck buttercup. Excellent article. Truths needed told need dictator lock damn country down. continue.

If think Biden fix mess. going bug surprise. Like say netherlands: Oei! that. Proper development children extremely important Zoom school compare.

Colleges, sure, probably close K-12 can't stay closed year plus. That's eternity child development.  China every case traced certain source. Maybe country that. mean can't done. think number would also include camp counselors others camp, students. live Europe. severe lockdowns, problem comes back haunt us. severe would Australia NZ now. Instead economy gets rekt again. ""Dr Birx reportedly travelled 20,000 miles visited 40 states since August, conducting meetings local health officials advise combat pandemic.""

Good her. Nice know someone gives shit thought Wisconsin bad. Though still probably ahead per capita basis. think so. I'm MT. state ways pretty remote towns 10K people maybe 3-7 ""cities"" depending want count. (Sorry Havre count!!)

The reality lots people coming state tourism, university, passing through, many people MT really feeling isolated. lot people feel like living '80s still (or wish were) MT kind like end earth. 

It's foolish think many people MT saw corona virus another thing would pass by. 9/11, Obama fever, BLM... things basically never effect what-so-ever state. think people thought corona another thing could ignore. covens small, much risk superspreading. Also important holidays tend outdoors. said, Samhain (Halloween) tends biggest turnout year. Kind like Easter service Christians. logistics all. vaccines coming apparently prevent spread. Jesus debate week ago?!! particularly disturbed keeping schools open US framed morally repugnant, completely ignoring public school system one important equalizing institutions modern democracies.

One sentiment often see Reddit particular is, “why keep schools open? Oh, it’s parents can’t arsed taking care kids, chose kids fuck them.” Completely ignoring fact schools aren’t taking care kids day, actually, know, teach things. Could also west believing freedom a) weld doors closed apartment buildings forcing people stay home. b) lie numbers people dying

Yes I'm looking mr pooh Bear ... What's going anyways? Back crowded pubs waiting next wave crash actually sensible reopenings? I’m you. Imagine delaying reading year. pretty sure it'd *eventually* happen, since bi-partisan support since 2000, even far back 80s. thought *might* happen next couple years gaining traction gov't. happened *really* fast sudden, yeah, bit surprise. 


It's exciting part something historic, Space exciting growing. hope general public stops seeing partisan issue, instead absolute necessity world reliant space, rapidly growing field, enemies already postured dominate (with Space Forces). odds certainly seem well favor Freddy Krueger wishes could created nightmare intense. don’t blame anyone going work sick. know blame? Companies refuse offer paid sick leave force people choose working enough hours eat staying home. Everyone know service industry gone work basically death bed wouldn’t made rent otherwise. hope anything pandemic makes paid sick leave thing working class.

Let give example. used work bar. policy meeting, higher ups explained would written calling work sick, would also written coming sick. response someone asked hell supposed do? “You chose work here.” imaginary one (didn't) study (fake) virology ""studies"" ""school"". know: part next sandy, golden beaches, cactus, fires, Hollywood Sign, Golden Gate bridge, marijuana plantations, agriculture inspection stations Patrick's Roadhouse. got downvoted oblivion suggesting schools open long feesible.

A year child's development eternity. Woman carry children though. Big difference. people unironically uttered phrase ""blue collar billionaire"". thought 3rd worse first bad second? governments around world involved shady shit wonder people start believing conspiracy theories. 

Main stream media bias apparent days well. agenda outside reporting truth people. people seeing bullshit. Economies can’t fully reopen, many a-holes still refuse adhere basic public mitigation guidelines. 

They reason governments must intervene protect infrastructure economies collapsing.

The ongoing economic damage disaster making. People need mask practice social hygiene stay tf home. think correct. think measures reduce Rt less 1. doubt going riots herd immunity complicated term, infections eventually reach point 67% starts sloooooow dooooown (call herd resistance) resulting long tail exponentially gets longer smaller...enough point spread never “ends”. Yeah, good luck Halloween, elections, Thanksgiving Christmas coming up. one person dies vaccine

IT'S DANGEROUS! STOP 250k people die wear mask

FAKE! HOAX! didn’t happen. lot moving parts this. look, Covid dangerous spontaneous average person posed bigger threat population; would absolutely different opinion willing make sacrifices. fact is, mild enough discussions sacrifices weighted (and think should). matter wanna spin it, two years life huge sacrifice asking lot us. Me, personally; I’m running money quickly. state running money. running dry. can’t print money. going ripple next DECADE me. 

I think agree happening sustainable it’s working. don’t think anyone solution, think majority needs kept mind making/enforcing policies. 

I also think enough known virus determine get really sick won’t. think part solution needs pouring money resources save much life possible instead trying prevent illness. know strategy isn’t working. None, countries make people work free deliver food shutdown people going buy food, like Western countries, cannot ask people work free illegal. lockdown useless never done Europe US. Remove gas lighting comment too, jerk. underground parties going months critical April...until medical infrastructure gets completely exhausted due COVID overload. I'm posing Reddit playing WOW LoL. difference. possible happening time almost every single customer talked work planning kind high-risk indoor activity like party going bar Halloween tomorrow? disconnect numbers way people behaving get bad? go outside get vitamin D. People sun belt often slathered sunscreen sit front computer indoors day.

Just there's lot sunlight mean comfortable exposed it. fact, lot places outright uncomfortable. Arizonans treat summers like people northern Canada treat winters. never go outdoors help it. seriously doubt missing 66-80% infections widespread testing is. next 2 months going grand finale shitshow 2020. Buckle up. stock market going get fucking nuked orbit Monday inaction. There’s plenty. us Europe U.S indifferent now. Even elderly. Check again. It’s 100k. 101k captain!  Well stop testing cases. Foxnews gonna report this? Nah. /s removes humor sarcasm reality defend it? way people defend Trumps behavior. Look, know every office dweller hours day work, LOT us. clear tasks, even get report that's due tomorrow done noon day actually understand technology spent months redoing things done make semi autonomous, that's downtime, well earned that. Someone needs put monologue videos terrorists nazis. roommate agreed help ferry friends' kids ""socially distanced"" trunk-or-treat tonight. Showed saw line around block, hundreds folks kids standing couple feet apart line. friend working said virtually masks. kids end trunk-or-treating 😂 picture summarises think US dumb. Omg, winter hasn’t even started. time traveler August. ...says neckbeard posting reddit. Baba Vanga said fucked 1986. expect end 2025 earliest, Europe almost empty end it.

I usually go psychics, lady (who died 1996) got hell lot things right. Nostradamus even get look in. catch stop worrying it, yknow? 100k. fucked. Bet ass working home, recieving unemployment living parents. Dont compare privilege situation people's ""Winter coming""

Yeah, seems like covid likes cold weather. Washi gton restaurants still strict capacity indoor dining tables people within household (so friend becomes brother dinner) bars closed. surprised even rural counties mask usage almost universal (at least counties I've to, far east state). Perhaps Washington shitty country? 100,000. new day... new record... think it’s truckers spreading it. I'm Australia got control months suppressed. also southernmost major city mainland. happen elsewhere.

Risk spreading seems increase away get equator.    That's fucking happens pretend pandemic exist Ya, looking good. seed everywhere, time start hoarding again, time wine make cold dark lonely winter... Feds lot control airports interstate transport. also funding power.  Yeah Florida definitely getting worse, sure numbers they're looking at

FL posted [5,500 new cases Check again. It’s 100k now. Pretty clear US following Europe again. breaking 3000 daily deaths next month so. (If action taken.) Comparatively lot concerning we’ve experienced 3 time highs last week 2 back back. Worldometer says 101k today.😡 might particularly popular say Reddit English-speaking forums general, crisis one rational authoritarian regime bases policy pure nonideogical self-interest without caring, pretending care, individual rights, capable long-term planning beyond election cycles extreme advantage democracies leaders pander lowest common denominator internalize propaganda feed masses.

I suspect might true climate change coming decades. environmental failures, CCP wants perpetuate rule indefinitely, know can't dead planet.

Obviously many democracies gone well crisis, part small relatively geographically isolated ones, like New Zealand, Taiwan, South Korea. Large democracies failing nothing blame irrationality self-delusion. didn’t send anyone Washington Oregon. would know. 

They trying press local Heath department drop mask mandate though hospital insanely busy due covid. wear mask hard. saw thread video: 20% Romania. ded. Bigly numbers. charge task force? fired. ""America First"" Trump slogan.

He's putting America first, that's sure. failure. remember first one two cases popped Washington state shut place like another Ebola outbreak. turned dozen people nursing home, small gut feeling could get control here. 

When showed NY boroughs (early Feb?) started planning worst, course shit going spread like wildfire crowded metropolis largely relies public transportation. Trump right, tired winning Article 10,000 cases off. Idaho Florida West. Romania 18%..... died lol behavior thing barbaric scenario. neckbeards need get computer go walk outside. much winning, I’m tired winning. Oompa Loompa Doopity Doo. care happens you. really say “so far” headlines. real wave starting. studies suggesting Covid-19 causing certain vitamin deficiencies, rather preexisting vitamin deficiencies making people likely get covid? C maybe one other....? Get flu shots, people Undefeated! sources prove ramblings total idiot supposed believe you?  Dude awesome, thanks sharing. cornbread? days ago learned someone sick apartment building, thought could cope stress first getting hand. Shit gets real see front you. panic attacks using elevator. government app shows us hotspots however makes things worse anxiety. guys advice reduce stress something let cope it? public awareness US population’s overall Vitamin deficiency.  Maybe save lives. USA!! USA!!

I miss era rest world actually looked us...  Currently showing 101,000+ worldometers. That's joke. also vaccine year up. also think reach immunity, large part, largest part immune gotten hard way. Actually got 101,000 now. We’re screwed rounded corner 45% grade mountain climb  Well done dick. 
Skill level upgraded. 
 
More nuanced response:. 
Defunding reallocating resources police broader activities fund entities. Thereby getting entities better target problems, also get police focus core functions. 
 
However, broader actions get embedded deeply police first place. Take step back. appears broader functions education out-reach came requirements elected officials appear make role already stretched police. 
To assume activities fit well Detroit may Minnesota delusional. However similar extention police roles occurred across wildly different
demographics. 
Having elected school boards, elected officials, elected chiefs using police keep elected makes system implementation law outsourced masses. 
Not good plan. 
 
Further that, funding go? must careful building correct resources take roles out-reach, education, prevention etc. widely open financial abuse. would better national framework. Hence original comment defunding seems dangerous idea. 
 
 Lastly, try dick little nuance thought.

Edit. Find fund 101k Bin Laden .... Biden .... biden portmantue Bin Laden/Biden ... therefore Joe Biden Osama Bin Laden. disguise course. 

#BigBrain said. That's sad article.

You wrote ""Healthcare workers dying 10ths every day.""

The article says 80 doctors nurses died *nation*, apparently since pandemic province Buenos Aires already 58 deaths among health personnel according survey Federation Health Professionals Argentina (Fesprosa) national level 80 deaths Covid 19 among doctors nurses.

It seems like **exaggerating** deaths write ""Healthcare workers dying 10ths every day."" -- make point, guess.

I want participate conversation.

Have nice evening. Stay safe! think trying walk fine line. Y'all expect act like Kate McKinnon SNL sketch. No. Hospitalizations increasing well. welcome show us state first second surge that's seen increased hospitalizations deaths follow. guys already tried line bullshit June dead wrong. Remember, ones KNOW about. many people walking around completely oblivious fact they're infected? Rounding corner? dark days ahead must corner  politicians KNOW isn’t hoax. aren’t stupid. sociopaths. don’t care know get cult following saying it’s hoax.

A lieutenant governor could absolutely call get tour hospitals icu, lab see patients look testing done. Lol you’re 20. I’m 10 years older I’m certainly planning continue clubbing Covid. years ahead you, don’t worry. *insert Fine gif* Fauci right ..how good? Nurses great taking care people line training. However, knowledge true diagnostic medicine slightly general public. would never take medical advice nurse unless NP. correlation COVID deaths exposure air pollution surprises you, paying attention. Consider young children going school far essential people going Halloween party. difficult people comprehend? sacrifice essential parts life go on. Yeah I’d N95 classroom happend South Africa.we peaked hard lockdown cases basically dissapeared after. knows. plan back January/ February. That's America needed. Holy cow. number undetected cases huge. happening France, Germany, Ireland, UK? It’s scary think many western countries locking 

The governor *could* call special session would that? 

Actually would smarter so, he's managed get every side hate blame Texas's dizzyingly incompetent response virus. florida man method Gov’t suggested dropping distance 1m initially order distancing quickly realized could even distance students space classrooms (large class sizes) dropped made masks mandatory enforceable schools. Stated anyone medical condition barring wearing mask ok. catch list medical conditions support schools allowed ask particular condition is. imagine quickly people medical conditions allowing wear mask. school districts also providing kind PPE staff. told wear non medical mask, dentist would know PPE could theory impact average hospitalization time per patient though, builds healthcare capacity. aware rampant slavery is

Apparently ot think UN would come rescue marines stealing half million dollar vessel radar.

It might *your* radar, absolutely radar international community companies could shut based international law. 

And yet Nike still selling clothes made Uighur slaves Chinese concentration camps nothing happened.

That absolutely forced work offered option nothing slavery.

All slavery involves forced labor, forced labor slavery.

I feel like good grasp definitions basic concepts here... good enough reasonable discussion anyway. week lockdown light, think next weekend almost March style one Ah, Nihilist. Nice. fit right Antifa far right. 

And sure, really care children future wrong right? time, UN wants depopulate. Now? Right now? makes special? Nothing. depopulation actual goal, would done decades ago. now. millioms 20 years ago. UN going choose time makes difficult do. Yea, ok. little surprising, Tippecanoe
""only"" 57 cases today, lowest almost 2 weeks Weird comment. internalize much. Let’s celebrate France’s response. Sometimes “freedom” overrated completely overshadows responsibility. 

But compared US response, Europe frigging genius. mAh FrEeDoMs

It's always bizarre contrast Edward Snowden. comes him, people make fun people talking freedoms suddenly talk lot freedoms.  I've met rutabagas smarter Dan Patrick. I’m sorry you’re far weeds trying justify irrelevant point. 

Sourcing claims might make far less arduous you. Thanks. Indoor dining schools. need shut two things. Nah, making dumb pun :) True, maybe 5-8 years, then. It’s unclear exactly 2nd wave Spanish flu worse, two theories mutated lethal lot WW1 soldiers transmitted it. co-workers wife hospitalized he's convinced flu shot got made sick covid. can't fix stupid. people scared virus cowards.

Ohhhhhhh see -- one mad lads. shameful

Gonna block right away. clear nothing constructive add discussions. charge ahead bravely life, wind catching COVID -- could put hospital weeks, leave high-six-figures hospital bill, maybe even cause death -- NEVER see come back subs acknowledge wrong are.

Good luck everything -- hunch need explanation. premise logical abortion failed first step. Ask question: tree falls forest one around hear it, make sound?

The answer yes. tree makes sound regardless whether hear it. bear shits woods regardless whether smell it. virus infects people regardless whether test people see whether infected. testing almost certainly dramatically increases true infection rate people quarantine learning infected, learn infected change behavior contagious. wasn’t born that. became result propaganda communism rose elsewhere world American leaders feared revolt American soil.

E pluribus unum – Latin ""Out many, one"" traditional motto US. goes back earliest congresses. 17xx first approved.

Its since post wwii Cold War individualism became motto.

Until bragged quickly united wars, shared sacrifices that. wanna shield people away truth despite proven wrong failed European lockdowns exactly said. Locking people house course illegal, paying people work also illegal, understand laws shut up. thing agree yes, idiots might willing work free, nobody done lockdowns, one deliver food free people go grocery stores lockdown, set example delivering food people free lockdown? give money people need need work? set example first voluntarily talking lockdown work. political matter point. Thanks! proved point. It’s far contagious far earlier far longer flu. 

Because Covid-19 isn’t flu. 

Cheers. Give months daily 9/11 let sink in.

You also certain deaths WW2 USA within shorter period time. Lmao West Hollywood often friends /family live there. checkpoint, lots people around. Take still available etc don’t know UN factors it, mother believes calculated depopulation plan. sure gets conspiracy material days, suspect Q-adjacent thing. keeping schools opened. sad. got really bad flu college, left weakened ended getting ear infection, eye infection, stomach flu. commission month. makes sense. 

Nobody going honor social distancing Christmas, meaning comes going huge uptick. Since future spread factor current active cases, getting Christmas Week case number low possible going critical ensuring January’s surge manageable possible. 

The world shown summer number reductions primarily due warm weather outdoor gatherings less likely result spread lax distancing mask use. weather turns, gatherings moved inside we’re already surging result. People aren’t proving capable willing responsible here, way ensure low pre-Christmas count full lockdown. 

I generally despise Boris Johnson, unpopular move, think it’s correct one UK better come mid-January. know confirmed cases small fraction total cases Imperial College study found reduce intelligence around 8 IQ points people get infected.

Imagine stupid average person is. imagine getting even stupider.   live West Hollywood, yes, lockdown time period. paper, reality, chief. must love liar. also contagious presymtomatic people (unlike flu), 

*Actually*: flu spread 1-2 days someone shows symptoms, COVID 2-3 days. lol wut 

Millions Americans volunteer sorts things every single day, epidemic not. It’s irrelevant covid-19 economy community mitigation efforts. 

Perhaps English isn’t first language something’s getting lost translation; can’t fault ya that. 

Volunteerism off-topic OP thread. 

And still refuse substantiate claims, despite good dozen opportunities so. eerie watch events unfold bear remarkable resemblence BLM marches US months earlier. question West learn anything.

As far US goes, maybe, late, esp Trump wins again, things brighter even Biden wins, federal gov't can't mandate/enforce state mask laws. massive amount people infected dying, start wake up, time late. New York cases provinces combined. higher positive percentage

In Ontario 2.4%.

Also neither limited herd immunity New York has. Cause many people got March-May NY? right, thats job without physical component. pandemic proof. schools opened limited capacity hybrid model. even need sitting desks like 10 feet apart masks EU made 63 demands governments cut spending healthcare and/or outsource privatise health services 2011 2018. 

It part responsibility this. No. parents need work afford live. read much news anyone. forget wife tried get elected Texas senate change law violated lol Amazing narrative shifts easily depending charge. Unfortunately live post truth society onus put emotion rather facts. feel/prefer something way, believe rather factual evidence contrary. complete lack critical thinking skill, social media reinforcement bubble means populace really sorry state. America trump uk brexit prime examples this. much winning Ah gotcha yes definitely makes things difficult situation. Luckily able practice. Like said aren’t easy answers also don’t think it’s right fair school employees put risk many jobs still done remotely large number government employees working way well. area reopened schools full force beginning September yet local governments returned normal operating procedures including sitting group. It’s totally hypocritical government’s part. It’s safe us work schools, oh fine. Meanwhile large number school staff higher risk groups  Governments telling people social distance, keep contacts minimum guidelines pertain schools state, California even stay home order one stayed home. Sure paper lock down, reality ""Poland's biggest protests decades stand abortion ban""

""Warsaw Mayor Rafal Trzaskowski said 100,000 people attendance, protest organizers put figure 150,000.""

At point still stop getting crazier? mean, wrong liar, means keep digging hole. Haha, no. would admission everything done said wrong happen. would encourage questions grandma killed morphine instead even given supplemental oxygen elderly care facility. personel infected using masks even washing hands going uninfected patients infected ones. Tegnell gloating months everyone else get bad effects Sweden wait little longer going possible judge ""strategy"" successful retires basically. way, people keeling streets even then, probably nothing serious statement effect ""wash hands maintain social distance, stay home sick; tut tut, make tut again"". give idea average student:teacher ratios different grade levels Europe? know it’s different everywhere, estimate? leader deserves gold medal/s clearly paying attention. never stayed home, business wanted go open. New Zealand 

* Public understanding China much better led much stronger media attention. February actively ignored played US media suppressed social media. lead 6PM news January tyre fire June New Zealand. People countries prepped greater complacency. 
* Highly centralised government meaning none national-subnational chaos seen elsewhere. governing structure also unimpeded constitutionality judiciary much greater extent.
* State health system means health seen purely personal issue.
* Respected health academics' personally influential politicians frequently quoted media.
* population ahead government concerns coronavirus meaning opposition opportunistically criticising instead less (although later changed).
* Public self locked extensively cases started taking coerced government managing public anyway.
* Stronger popular memories Spanish Flu fact killed 22% neighbouring country.
* Shame crisis collectivism seems prominent culture likely related ancestry size population. I'm three people today. need too, I'm living like mole anymore. wrecking me. tried hard honestly... anymore. another year. can't it. March 18 - April 18th. Specific enough ya? least they’re opening schools continue spreading working parents coworkers too. 

Oh, that’s what’s going already data. 

Who’s ready COVID Treat spike Thanksgiving get togethers. 

Then Black Friday spike Christmas get togethers. 

Wake New Years, spikes hurting eyes.

Edit: bet aren’t anything Pandemic profits made trading drug companies working vaccines wall street. Old news, D614G known months now.

In Europe new dominant strains, 20A.EU1 20A.EU2. latter better binding affinity D614G, already infectious original Wuhan variant, probably making even infectious D614G. say spread open doors?? I'm sooooo confused..what what?? going banned comment, insults allowed subreddit, comment removed. least moron changed tune. 

To avail? Opening pubs telling people go eat drink indoors turning around blaming people listening him? 

He's tone-deaf ever was. point happy virus create zombies. new generations expect everything free easy. We're gonna nothing, contribute nothing, goddmamit good enough. know really help? Trump rallies people traveled place 230,000. Two hundred thirty thousand deaths. acknowledge becomes another statistic? 230k, let sink in.   Yes. can. 

Will they? No. exceptions, places qualify. wouldn’t wearing mask disrupt plan? lot? I'm curious 9 months pandemic, many children received education technology internet access. 2020 internet basically utility. chromebook sub $100 school systems. curious actual figures this. kids given chromebooks means internet(I've seen $20/month plans) children failed Yes, promote strategy. However, even ""flattening curve"" different endgoal, aims achieve herd immunity slow lucky, assistance vaccine. Misworded headline Remember Sturgis?[Sturgis motorcycle lock down? Please specific Gallup: 56% U.S. satisfied conditions now, even pandemic (we rounding turn!), 4 years ago Obama/Biden. Hasn’t equaled recent times! I'd say rather strong family values general respect authority. got better end, they? Ok, l dopa complete cure, still great movie. Doesn’t rate high mean testing isn’t widespread enough? GET HER! countries also done restrict spread virus USA. countries done even less generally worse infection rates. However, pointing countries poor attempt move goalposts people ask ""Could US reduce infection rate?""

The answer yes, could, no, reducing number tests accomplish that. Well, masks anything. hopeless think protect ourselves, reopen economy enjoy world get depopulated. /s Base far lower employment numbers, shows people would rather go back work given choice, people scared virus cowards. There’s gonna many families think “Seeing relatives won’t hurt, there’s way virus get us” come holiday season it’s gonna bad Greenwich mean time We're number one! Ha. one work using everyone recorded hypothermic. stopped using thermometers. They're accurate half people covid fever. Election day. 2020. think time spread young fauci Well, fair, takes controlled opposition lame duck democrats really make things happen (e.g., prevent stimulus checks, increase homelessness, etc.). wear kente cloths they've got going ha ha.

Everything terrible, 2020. way may hospital overwhelm run resources treat it, surge hospital likely thing soon. even know means.  Yep one favorite McCain moments. It’s incredible see far Republican Party fallen short time. Wow! playing many stereotypes - gun toting, Bible carrying flag waving. Dreaming makes shitload people unable vote next week, *IF* follow quarantine. Kinda weird, previous post said 92,000. So, 100k election day? 2020 gone Easter......2022 income. spend. Buy stocks wait? Yes, Belgium also densely populated, much regions U.S. sparsely populated still experiencing record high ICU numbers, Montana SD. 90 so? still 50 days till even start winter.

If assume maybe 50 million already, million average next 140 days, gets us 190 million, close 60 population.

Close enough? pandemic anymore! ultra pandemic. They've ended it, evolved ultra pandemic. Thank you, Trump Murder! Wear mask, make sure wash/sanitise hands touching communal surfaces reduce risk greatly.  
 
That's really offer, taking steps mitigate risk help lower stress levels bit. turning corner. we’re turning corner parallel x-axis parallel y-axis. Trump's care cost much again? 

And explain excess deaths scenes hospitals around world  work Idaho’s third largest hospital, 30 minutes away largest second largest no, that’s case. Idaho isn’t even remotely full hospitals. 4 COVID patients last week, 10 ICU. leaves plenty room get more. governor quarantine still means lot new people constantly getting infected though... wait wasn’t highest 80k back??? serious? /s

This year trick treating trying joker. rounding corner. toward almost nothing. also testing less people die... downtown bars general full holes dancing ass ass 15% mask wearing reclassified “restaurants”.  majority fb friends haven’t following protocol anything possibly can, get away with. Ive horrified many people asking wants come over, go nonetheless going gyms like. people would surprise knew many folks aren’t getting tested... Please stop calling Trump.

Yep. it. Told take tylenol, hydrate tough out. mean said would flee US Biden wins

I believed one seen COVID-21 teaser trailer? looks crazy. Though people reckon won’t last long. 3rd factor correlation ... Vitamin deficiency high elderly people. COVID kills elderly people. Common factor instance. Hard correctly search since much backwards—that extra Vitamin make healthy young healthy causes deficiency.

The [study cited summarizes conclusions, ""We find relationship vitamin concentrations vitamin deficiency severity disease."" EVERYBODY! doesnt help pain get tests there. least deaths remain low imagine COVID transmit quite easily via candy wrappers. means 1 4 tested virus. bueno person corrected is, fact, correct, ""using buzzwords understand."" Yup, switching online school. It’s crazy every time break record, it’s states even done reporting. time article quickly written posted r/coronavirus, it’s already 10%. *another* article written late evening posted captures even-larger-margin record breaking day.

It’s recurring theme I’ve noticed lol USA! USA! worried India would take lead, America knows win! I'm brought back 2pac song, Death around corner.  Honestly, probably idea would fast knew came said it, would fight hands it. Please love God vote scientifically illiterate trump administration still denying pandemic opposing mitigating measures like masks

People dying, please place country politics vote overwhelmingly stupidest country earth. US really bad, second everyone is.

Apparently Belgium numbers adjusted population equivalent US 690,000 cases one day wife totally approves this. mind one bit! =P bad rural Ohio. like one believes even virus. Mission accomplished weird forced death cult. Great timing  Ditto Washingon (DC). still measures great comparably.  Almost like there's correlation measures place keeping low numbers.

Really? likely outcome along.  Same. celebrate sleep 5 am, never go bed midnight. Shits messed up. Yeah, US actually caught many total cases shpuld lauded must best testing regime. Mmhmm less people admitted. second wave infectious hits people better immune systems. Exactly. disgusts people would rather see 230,000+ lives lost give fraction mountain gold sit on.

UK luxurious excuse...

Although covid responses alone, ignoring mid-outcome numbers we're seeing, US' seems like single worst one. havent taken steps towards ending it. They've done jack shit. Yeah, plenty tests now. means nothing government essentially allows country whatever want. C’mon man, said check Instagram don’t believe him. OMG! thinking 100k December even gotten November now. Andrew Johnson pretty insane well? presided country finished actual civil war. Instead trying heal country, shat everyone. guess unlike now, Congress shat back tried best fix country. Like Fuck. Repulicunts always screeching 'local authority' devolved governance. Except goes self-inflicted wound results. think looking 200-300k case day within 1 2 weeks.

This far removed even fiction. positivity rate bad? 5% bad, right? He's looking graph sideways, going drop rollercoaster bottom much worse. NBC news reporting 98,583 new cases today, 10/30/20. 😕 Also ""no morals"" Prayers thoughts. sure watching something akin fall Rome Nero fiddling Rome Burns...

It's above, it? Joe Biden mandated masks look sorry loss. Good news best friend who's meant social distancing mask wearing also possibly lessen amount flu going around might possibly less flu deaths year would bring excess deaths give allusion COVID going fact 

This subreddit insane though. dare post anything pessimism get downvoted hell lol. wondering, countries stockpile toilet paper Italy stockpiling *Tampons*?

Questions: Noticed Worldometers US done 143 million tests. Clearly, mean 143 million people tested. imagine lot people tested multiple times. Hypochondriacs, example. people got follow tests testing positive first got sick. people tested negative April, got sick August got test positive. 

Do know many individuals tested US? 

Do states report percentage positive tests delineate circumstances test? 
For example, get sick test positive, test positive two weeks later test negative two weeks that, three tests get measured calculation percentage positive tests first one? three tests get reported state health departments first one? 38% ish Mexico :/ hardly testing all. Antarctica doesn’t exist goofball. would underside flat earth that’s possible

The Chinese government mandated everyone shelter place 11 weeks *after* holiday already started. Almost CNY events cancelled overnight millions people forced stay in-laws places two months. allowed send one person per household per day get groceries. outdoor activities strictly forbidden. reason China able get Covid control domestically great sacrifice holiday.

If choice now, would gladly trade strict 11 week lock year misery.  Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically.

Lock Canadians igloos blows over. way! joke Republicans. US need stimulus more.  planned better. government wants fewer you, especially vulnerable.  Article says 'Oct. 30, 2020 / 9:45 AM' here.

Article Thursday's numbers. ""on Friday showed addition 88,500 cases Thursday, "" earliest memory chinese government locked roads in/out Wuhan late Jan. feeling things bad mid Jan occurred, extreme measure would spiral there.

 expectations going in. happy COVID response currently am, feel world got hit sooner us--then paved way early response, worst it; feel afflicted rejection response, feel economically cannot commit response, feel trying respond--but rejected community members rejecting respond. 

It depressing time doubt. Sometimes wish idiot could live ignorant bliss... seems could still successful times perhaps happy, case. means smart man, way world Pretty cool everyone decorated year. feel shitty. Wally glad. seen ""Biggest one-day"" concerning US title couple times now. think makes sense? hasn’t much mortality cutting progress since August available public yet, buckle freak up.  

What saw Florida Texas everywhere now. 4 weeks younger cohorts given older cohorts week 3 infections rough numbers put relentless. 

I remember right spike deaths June everyone saying “cases rising deaths” well 4 weeks later boom 3 regions. Think numbers June-August put basically AZ, TX, &amp; FL. 

That’s like found tumors part body sucked got treatment.  doc calls 3 months later says cancer got lymphatic system popping everywhere. That’s now.  Virtually treatments August use monoclonal antibodies yet hotspots EVERYWHERE... like literally everywhere. 

On August 4 Dr Birx warned next phase would rural widespread.  Trump basically called loser sidelined her.  are. New Zealand island.

This kind crazy. government talking aboit controlling borders testing, I'm sure talk.
As well would pretty fucking expensive.
I'm syre closed borders yet. tomorrow “bUt TeStInG!”  ""Never let good crisis go waste"" -Rahm Emanuel Inside, vast majority people masking properly many stores actively enforce this. subway, sometimes couple people per car wearing mask properly, generally choose switch next car next stop. street, it’s much mixed bag experience. leave west Queens give reference point.

Yeah, NJ averaging like 1500 cases day now, think country 100,000 today without us contributing much all... big oof change months ago led country cases NY. cases rising we're entering definite second wave NJ, still goes show taking thing seriously actually does, got control while, still pretty control compared states (for now, hopefully still fare better). know getting downvoted. correct. 7490 deaths reported today globally. since mid April. five days deadly today, April 7 April 17. I'm using Worldometers site post links to. 100k coming soon course, we're another day closer voting. There's people mind tricking...namely wear masks nose. even 10 day far I’m looking forward daily death counts 2 weeks. world total today around 573k recorded cases. 101k that. Ive 2 times third hopefully won’t hurt. April august ! I’d take covid flu anyday.    Yeah, Sweden cold... perfect year dressed plague doctor. Opponent? reelection 20222 likely run Governor instead. Sadly, good chance win Republican primary. means highly likely looking next Governor Idaho. state stupid sometimes. Florida always trying hard count test. Beware indications FL well, likely political economic push. Numbers increasing too. likely due sheer stupidity rather weather-related. Bruh, That's total cases China. remember press conference talked one family members tested positive. said, ""I told stay away Mom."" knew doing. knew dangerous put COVID + patients nursing home. knew elderly risk. gave residents homes care gave mother. choose lesser two evils

There things could done. could used hotels house infected. could used hospital boat sent NYC. mean linear - number new cases per day gets bigger time? case average leads 1 new case, exponential.

It's dumb headline point is, anything get worse longer wait anything, worse get. Imho, told people think cocid stay home quarantined automatically seen positive. like idea it, strick. Inauguration? pot said kettle black 1.7 million dead americans, vast majority preventable, acceptable outcome anyone that's raging sociopath. Trump holding graph upside down. reason though, no? can’t spontaneously virus became contagious. 

Testing could improved amount people covid higher thought, maybe schools open asymptotic kids passing around, clue? Vehicles kill around 35,000 Americans year, isn’t even league. Please take time go read data. What's Nth Dakota? (source : notAmerican). [calling week ago. many people thread. common places right now. hit time high Ontario take long. Worldometer reporting 101k new cases today!
Edit - 'new cases' kind potato crack smoking? What’s concerning utterly widespread COVID country — regions, rural urban alike. primes nearly entire country rapid overwhelming spread everywhere. Previous waves largely region-specific, allowed us reallocate focus resources hard-hit areas. we’ll deal *entire country* COVID siege simultaneously.

Fauci warned us pleaded country get daily cases 10,000 hit fall/winter. nearly 10x that, it’s even winter yet... reputable model predicting two thousand deaths day February. means hospital capacity ability treat better now. less people die average. capacity isnt infinite room runs hospitals medicines dry gonna lot pain. Also doesnt know someone died people numbers people lives families suffering. quarter of. Amillion american lives snuffed lives. Make sure vote.  That's cool. Trick treating really fun experience, sad (although obviously understandable given we're dealing with) setup really cool. Kids still get participate safe.  well since say need x5 real number cases vs official ones, USA needs 36 million cases herd inmunity.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* believe one bit. deaths per number cases dropped dramatically since earlier year. United States, example, see dramatic climb cases absolutely change average daily deaths - climb started way two weeks ago, use ""delay cases deaths"" excuse. real estate increases value. Depending someone paid house + much work put it, could losing money sell it. “I’m job” applies people excusing Nazi stuff. good laws. That's US. We're talking Florida. They’ve actually never found proof Joseph consummating marriages (with Fanny Alger example, one people always bring up.) Fanny’s personal journals say nothing respectful positive character descriptions Joseph, many DNA test studies children/grandchildren determined intercourse involved. idea “marriages” sealings (to seal secure place Heaven) life Earth, thus consummating actually occured. It’s easy pick apart Joseph much research actually proves otherwise.  anybody votes *republican* blood hands Well even herd immunity thing COVID, million cases day would still take year reached it. scale 100,000 scratching surface. Pretty amazing. Make 101,461 true. fact, unless number people infected every day significantly higher, number deaths reach levels earlier year due higher rate survival thanks improved treatment protocols.

The thing is, number cases deaths earlier year could much lower governments acted earlier/differently.

Waiting second wave bad worse first wave stupid. Sweden nations saw happened little nothing prevent spread virus. would think would learned act sooner second wave would reach heights. sadly appears many nations learned thing.

Numbers lower right now, means *now* time act *before* numbers get high again. sure, 60%+ pretty significant. many healthy people exhibit seizures either. crazy people's minds look data still try dismiss it. 220,000+ people died Covid-19 yet lot still argue could influenza ailment. get car accident die hemorrhage, would say car accident hemorrhage cause death? Mostly karma. prefer checking numbers end day reason words

verified I've seen headline higher numbers time think three times last week? disgusting... relevant discussing? salty, handling global crisis global level. every platform possible. get deleted automoderator. 99.3% fine. better? turned corner alright - turned instead down. ""love love love I'm liberal"" types death us all

the armed nazis literally goddamn street worry passing lungs right way you. Actually yeah. mean Hollywood actors pro athletes play. sorta dated concept video games. ""I'm alright"" mean that’s probably positivity rate high is. Similar beginning pandemic US, isn’t surplus tests available, get tested symptoms risk contracted COVID. positivity rate artificially high. real problem comes average people go get tested (like US. I’m tested weekly). dilutes positivity rate. 7% huge deal means we’re really horrible job.  going get really bad, fear. 

We're hitting 100,000 day we're probably halfway current wave. People inside cold weather. People tired wearing masks distancing. Family gatherings happening cause *it can't happen us*. We're going see week 1 million cases Thanksgiving Christmas. know I'm supposed shocked think number going surprise us more. sad day America Wahhhhhhhh people get fine. Wahhhhh also function able treat better. Death rates patients severely ill covid declined good bit. one benefits flattening curve, less people die get better treating time. everyone gets early on, would blood bath. That's just... hell? makes dick bigger? actual fuck wrong people? much party “small government” “local control”. someone link BNOs citation info? can't find twitter, obviously, news story it.

I hard time trusting news station Netherlands ""fills missing information"", per website. read that, see *estimated* infections peaking 300k per day mid December decreasing. Confirmed infections would definitely lower, little different third wave we’re first time MULTIPLE people know coming it, didn’t single close friend family member tested positive 2 weeks ago number 8. It’s going hard companies invest office space city many people work home. new business model could incorporated companies rent space monthly quarterly face-to-face meetings They’re unions yes, nature union completely different. EU political union way USA is. president. Check structure, it’s totally different. importantly, contrary US, EU nation. countries much indépendant defiant.

At current time, would impossible EU define enforce coordinated response COVID-19 doesn’t authority so. Sure would cool sort federal relief work potentially expose high-risk family members shit paying high exposure workplace. keep thinking got halfway decent leader, much better we’d be. live dark comedy. thoughts prayers. well yeah cause live China pandemic started now. opinion based one, real experience biased media?

Not needs lying, China put process contain virus online, building capsule hospitals week help dealing infected patients, city province-wise lockdown, mass testing screnning temperature mandate mask wearing public, started late January. Plenty evidences online check even foreign media. get story from, FOX? 

maybe ask anyone live (non-chinese skeptical) source, instead smokes mirrors FOX whatever Trump round clock care, experimental treatments, touch go. fucking cold, post one study shows less deadly cold. can't fake news zombie refuses believe reality talk show host told to. mom FH helping Trunk Treat. Kids survive without single Halloween, keep dumb maybe next Halloween also canceled. data Sweden seen way, need bit time lower average deaths confirm pattern. many governments made better decisions, seems could've want to. pandemic proof jobs 

There thing that. Even RN's laid off/fired right now. job safe. money? can't lockdown without paying people destroy entire industries. Half small businesses SF permanently closed operational restrictions 10 months. fine PPP paying people work less efficiently, ended months ago.

We able lockdown January that's assuming Biden wins. Turning corner exponential curve. getting concerned hit 3 percent. Thank God I'm US. Wow. Even linear rather exponential growth, see million cases 10 days. is, we'll probably see within week Louisiana too. democratic governor good job. Currently fighting revoke restrictions mask mandate, reduced occupants building, etc. Driving around like normal. hobbling him, succeeding! infuriating haha cheers m8ey mean biggest one day increase ***so far*** people working.

10-20% unemployment really bad. People would still vote Tory election tomorrow though ! People eat old lies printed right wing tabloids ! Even brand good businessmen. create valuable brand diluting it, example taking supposedly valuable luxury hotel/resort brand applying steaks shitty neckties. that's easier said done can't afford eat, pay rent, job, wonder people would panic serious reaction say 200,000 wont getting new phone 2020. per capita reference, Japan population 126 million US 331 million.

US 28,100 cases per million (2.81% entire population)

Japan 788 cases per million (0.079% entire population) That's take well. real number infections certainly higher, number superspreader events, primary driver pandemic, caused untracked cases probably high either.

I'm guessing *rate* untracked cases VS population might higher US well. Per fauci idiot Next milestone says 500,000 dead. Fauci says February. say might early December. Literally mad ?  suspend property tax at-risk homeowners/small landlords.

I lost job gig work. got property taxes mail yesterday. idea going afford that. kicker pay December, get late fees. think knows odometer is? Huh, basically exactly 1% death rate currently. Crazy. I’m doing... tried make little festive nightmare Christmas themed chute. I'd hope everyone, regardless education level, work advice doctors scientists. long R next name, that's matters majority voters Idaho. endocrinologist unrelated tests, mentioned globally, everyone seems vitamin deficient. majority patients, even daughter spending entire summer tanning beach, vitamin deficient also. people ""deficient"" experience effects deficiency.

I full blood panel done afterwards testing another issue, also vitamin deficient.

So either medical community somehow screwed deciding levels vitamin normal humans, there's recent world-wide change people's behavior that's caused everyone live lifestyles eat food lead deficiency. agree I’m bars packed weekend. one gives two shits virus recently lost cousin underlying conditions spent three weeks ventilator. Shits sad aint nothing compared 3 weeks new year I’m AZ (chandler) built candy chute.... I’ll porch blocked kids can’t get doorbell too. It’s cuz know win. France 50k cases 20% positive rate.

So better them. one live in, least *part* live subreddit saying time things run natural course like month ago.

Edit: look comments. Lol think 2020 finale?

It's dress rehearsal worse things come: climate change, triggers massive refugee crises. Wildlife extinctions. Worse pandemics. Wars drinking water.  god visit sub frequently? you’d remember study suggested people may susceptible reinfection I’m hoping get opinions without slamming states seeing increases time right now. past, states regions would see cycles peaks we’re seeing almost increases time. changed? Masks still vast majority I’m everyone get fatigue time? [100,000 cases Respectfully, allowed trade name experience months everyone could see disinformation pushed WH. time speak. think bit revisionist. Canada....hmmm pretend know right answer was, I'm pretty sure politicians making decisions (and figuring pay state budget) right move either.

This nothing inept politicians. inept society let doctors jobs. 🤢🤮

That's really tough one. never know I'm helping patronizing business, selfish. Absolutely. still nearly 100k excess deaths unaccounted nationally.  Sane governments shut hardcore hospitals overrun. 

I fear going see less well-run governments patients hallways like Italy March. sure? feel like trump called Democrat hoax pretty early, attacked democratic governors responding crisis.

I dont remember period time republicans right thing. Tbf seen many reinfections farm yh far pretty rare mean reinfections can't happen can't become common near future. even covid still taking precautions like social distancing etc incase salty Depends serious them. Trump quickly recovered he's anti lockdown ever. Boris Johnson nearly died became lockdown aficionado recovery. Better seven months (and counting) forever. Plus Halloween, election, Thanksgiving four weeks...Christmas, New Year... augur well. funding doubled.

Then split force. one force, without weapons handcuffs. enforce traffic vice laws. becomes criminal call backup.

Then regular police force, actually money training. involved criminal cases. (No vice laws traffic).

But.... costs money. One hand Bible, another hand gun - way Jesus intended. need paper bag heave into. next three months shitshow either way. Biden wins, least know adults back charge Jan 20th. every state ex-Army, ex-NIH, ex-CDC. ran PEPFAR Obama.

Adjusted population, looking approximately 1/3 new confirmed cases US today. 3500 new cases population 39 million, US 100,000 cases 328 million. easy call people say ""I told so"" time hate.

That seems sub about. thinking side creamatorium. ummm....you realize thousands people dying every days many facing homelessness, right?

but yes poor landlords... 7% positivity rate nationwide is... great. course cant entirely certain last lockdown came time widespread testing even available yet noone knew real number infections. real number back likely much higher now, took longer. article saying 20000 0. That's accurate. Victoria 20000 cases total since start pandemic.

We went 700 new cases 0 100 days. right. cognitive rehabilitation people afflicted brain damage. worse things death Easy misread headline 1000 deaths day. information worded clearly (first bit state New Mexico crossed 1,000 deaths related COVID-19 Friday reported 13 new deaths Friday, single “grim milestone,” called governor, came state experiences highest numbers ever cases hospitalizations, deaths start increase well. chose - well covid. Opening windows doors valid way ventilate spaces. don’t need expensive air purifier. Wow, big psychological barrier broken here. point transmission virus achieves critical mass even PPE, distancing, lockdowns little effect? 3,000 deaths day? I'll take bet lol miss Romney Republicans.

They led us directly now. kinda proud it. I'd written 'baseless presumptions' part use many words authenticity's sake.

Democratic Texan, hope Texas voters long memory Abbott cronies come re-election handling pandemic blatant voter suppression election. expose COVID Doordash Amazon deliveries? internet, electricity clean water? Sounds like think working class collateral damage ok Geez forget winter, decade. sooner think! agree, Idiot-in-Chief loses sure leave big mess possible clean up, much possible maximise toll throughout winter gets dragged office.

If wins, still bad, clear *anything* practical done stop time. Judging Europe's current plight, half baked lockdowns occasional masks going stop spread. going winter death hardship like seen since WW2 Northern Hemisphere.

US alone might add another 500,000 dead winter, even though better job treatment were. Sheer numbers cases get us there. Hospitals overload. they're suing attacking twitter. Kinda feels like it’s getting started. also think Germany handled first wave reasonably well, RKI estimated time ratio infections cases 11 16, iirc. Yes pandemic going wait people finish discussing seeing numbers really puts context amazing China detects odd 100 cases every again, especially considering population way larger US, Germany, European country. people come querying numbers, dad lives China, lived 9 years know life pretty much back normal there. bad news widespread, seemingly willpower anything anymore.

Narrator: *that plan*  Well 100s thousands cases one would think figured treat better.... We've used covid problems calc class  Another day, another record America, headed one darkest winters peoples lives finally reached states. states south country kept embers burning summer, well autumn. Vitamin low, humidity low, election season etc. still first wave, makes worse never got cases low enough summer.

Europe trouble reach USA's lofty heights coming lower base. Actually think produce exposed sun, skin manufacture vitamin D. “We vitamin receptor cells that, chain reactions starting conversion cholesterol skin, produce vitamin D3 they’re exposed ultraviolet B (UVB) sun,” says Yale Medicine dermatologist David J. Leffell, MD, chief of Dermatologic Forbes - 80% workers live paycheck paycheck. 80% country living close poverty line income thing. UK apparently worse ""worst case"" projections too. Congradulations first offical reporter subreddit 100k Almost surely darkest winter living memory. It’s rising much quicker first wave insane! hurts. Born raised Boise, Idaho's capitol, yup, checks. Love place, except 10% increase avg rent year rightist assholes everywhere. Oh look, misreporting UK England England UK.

Must day ending Y. past months, especially interviews, doing?

Hell time try retrieve reputation toilet long.  Famous last words anyone made correct prediction? keeps increase rate, see 200k per day month. What's scary nationwide surge - back earlier waves regional (e.g., NYC / Mid-Atlantic, Sunbelt, etc.). entire country get swamped maybe meant coroner? want debate this? way things work Germany, Western countries, people elect governments, governments make decisions. happened. What's wing it? 101k right Scots listen Sturgeon, competent leader. really, looking countries elections cases didnt spike, wait end year festivities Flu 2.0 That’s COVID death. ""Dr. Doom Gloom"" under-predicting 100k / day cases 2 months, that's good. Open windows, ceiling fans on, air purifiers UV-C light house thanksgiving Christmas celebrations. cold heater on. Landlords run business, provide service need exchange money. enter contractual agreement exchange. 


If logic right, walk nearest grocery store, fill cart, walk automatic doors without paying. ask, I'll say, ""you realize thousands people dying every days many facing hunger, right?"", keep walking.


If government wants pay landlords rent civilian cannot, okay that. many US programs already provide service. Section 8, subsidized housing, etc. People apply assistance receive it. then, government decide private citizens organizations need provide government housing free. 


When first put place, people thought might months. tenants go back work catch missed rents. going 7 months stopping. tenants can't pay going quickly catch mortgages taxes still need paid. Merkel predictions Germany too. know CDC thought this, make point telling you.

They tell straight ""expected deaths"" calculated averaging deaths years 2013 - 2019. 

They also say information air final 12 months. also say ""Excess Deaths"" would 25% fewer used different counting system.

The Experts say stuff, average folks (and people write online articles) dont pay attention ""fine print"" stuff think numbers saying something necessarily saying. lookup information (that there's flu season year) know interpret that. problem flu (flu death, flu case) flu numbers also estimated figures I'm wrong. statistics flu done good COVID-19, estimated. thing need explained excess non-COVID death. Yup That’s scary stuff. late party, already 100,000+ according worldometers trump wannabe. Loeffler, Perdue, Kemp shameful. Hoping state GA turns blue. think Halloween PARTIES, might problem, thanksgiving Christmas gatherings. vote 11/3, wearing mask around (I live NY). 

Not every state many protections NY though. parties/gatherings real problem Metaphorically bigger literally bigger? think got beat latter one... Yea think states lockdown themselves. way trump ever national lockdown London shutting next week. 

Germany going close again

France. 

Europe el fuckarood again. 

Why people thinks goes away staying inside beyond me. 

Gota shut borders whole 9. Australia seemed work NZ. Well, people stealing honest businesses feel deserve need it. yes theft, sticking man. scumbag :) know that. always told essential process bodies actually creates vit d. Til. add em back mortgage rocket science. I'm sure case around country leisure drive parts Wisconsin Minnesota tonight since live close state lines. even though Friday night seemed like every bar restaurant went full capacity even overflow parking. could see inside could even spot employees wearing masks.


That's Wisconsin reports 5,000+ cases record high 3,200+ Minnesota. 100K country today may start horrific third wave. 150K sound impossible now. called expontital growth. spread gets establish outbreaks begin merge one. USA one outbreak pretty much. matter anymore ( ""task force"" ) don't. given up. waiting vaccine election results party wins, whichever comes first. know could use shapiro sentence like that, read voice. Well said. Midwest states laughing stock lmao is. 

good news percent positive still lower peak late summer.

the bad news widespread, seemingly willpower anything anymore.

sky limit right high could go. specify: amazing white people one point. kind suck (but obviously still quite stratified) Gulp Number fucking one baby. makes sense lockdown November eased time Christmas. lockdown earlier relaxed earlier, cases start increasing Christmas - great. extremely generous assumption allowing government sense reasoning do. USA! USA! USA!

But seriously, goddamn atrocity. incredible horrifying witness. take look chart Worldometers. remember good 'ole days handful states upward 8-10k cases day. Look see pretty much every state getting smacked. (Posting anyone hasn’t seen yet)

Not cases surging, worrying trend hospitalizations seem increase every single day. helpful resources depict hospitalization surge:

[Total currently hospitalized broken region - broken region - **per especially surging per capita hospitalizations Midwest.

Also, [great resource tracking test-positivity Nationally, positivity rate moderately increasing, trends concerning Midwestern mountain states. 24% U.S. hospitals using 80% ICU capacity, based reporting nearly 5,000 ""priority facilities,"" hospitals joined ranks recent weeks. can't actually govern effectively try popular instead! **+1,495**  

We officially broke 100K. Thanksgiving Christmas going brutal.

With caseload like is, hundreds thousands thanksgiving gatherings transmission sites. spread virus many places. Christmas prevalence could high crazy percentage American Christmas gatherings coronavirus positive attendee.

Health authorities likely screaming people gather thanksgiving. Fuck end. truly going one depressing winter  know everybody pissed comments, serious legal issues stake, namely, judge issue rules like this, power properly rests governor legislature.  makes sense, thank you. states don’t really get cold? ""we rounding turn"" 

jfc.... EXACTLY I've thinking. worst possible time big wave holiday season coming less month, election year too. expecting urbanized states/counties locked Thanksgiving. Another doubling new cases per day would see hospitals everywhere overwhelmed. New record number tests!! ""Like predicted"" lol. Holy shit, someone give job guy predicted Covid would get worse winter! Rounding corner 101K Oh shit that’s ton population Yes, that's done various banks landlords I've read nearly answer hope would be. kicking problem road many millions people lost jobs businesses coming back anytime soon, ever. We're number 1, we're number 1.... think might right Yes. essentially point though.
The towns ones getting ravaged virus. Unfortunately, happening New York City Long Island. 
Why death infections occurring within towns lot positives March?  regular testing + temperature checks everywhere go. That's found asymptomatic case Kashgar week ago. said fucked back March. think got one right. go back March tell past self things would look now... would’ve laughed. shit ridiculous. get u notice DHS cracking whip BLM protests Portland? Let’s delude act like government totally bound constitution. literally live rogue state. idk getting downvoted Stop it, can’t move there! It’s interesting “expert” talking head brought say Fauci wouldn’t. didn’t Scott brought in. It’s revolving door devolving authority.  Also said millenials inhereting 12 trillion soon. Might even sooner It’s already 101,000 heart breaking restaurant workers here. appreciate much shutting down, hate it. also hate Senate selfish can't provide support help them. 
People's selfishness led this, selfishness make harder recover well.  mean spin tell truth knew it.

You literally wrap fucking shirt bandana around head, put paper town face, better nothing. Well, example there's country also process negotiating surrender Taliban... Yup, primes nearly entire country rapid overwhelming spread everywhere. Fauci warned us pleaded country get daily cases 10,000 hit fall/winter. nearly 10x that, it’s even winter yet... would blocked almost immediately tried. mid April around 90,000 new cases daily worldwide, seeing 500,000 new daily cases now.  think they're purpose guage public reaction. matrix crumbling well, Mr. Orange say they'd ""rounding curve"".... happened go opposite direction said it. I’m really money gets parents.  Argentina started surging August study ended.
By end study, Argentina 215K covid cases 10k deaths.
Right now, Argentina 1.15 MILLION covid cases 31k deaths span 2 half months.
There 28K healthcare workers infected 10% dead obviously work. rest world sure seems lot cases mask wearing. **Oct. 31, 00:00 (UTC+9)**

Unreal selfishness, stupidity ignorance. Also quite comparable middle hot summer. It’s lot tougher winter Melbourne’s winter hilariously mild compared Europe Look Gresham, Tigard, OR. 

Still condos around $150k near Portland, OR. Can't make military enforce federal law states; unconstitutional. National Guard run individual states anyway collapse united states

Sadness china fill void Useful link. Thanks. Still huge uncertainty margins. happening country :( Beginner’s luck. Seriously, could ever guessed guy dedicated life study specific thing considered published expert field would gotten right? Winter coming Noones inflating deaths. responsible medical shortage deaths resulting failing control spread equally responsibly deaths, even they're +1 count. would died Covid spread addressed. Note, 24% Covid deaths underlying conditions. Nope, live town 70,000 Canada one professors community college passed away. 

One best friends Netherlands currently it. Ontario Quebec right New York live, worse us. less population, less testing, higher positive percentage. Less testing, less cases. guys lot cases you’re catching. Smash like button forget subscribe! cops sure seem content serve ""psycho cops"" give jobs instead kicking first sign psycho. Perhaps consult governor Florida? chance defend truth president said inject disinfectant put light inside people.

Sarcastic words president carry weight used irresponsibly job around set record strait immediately. that. Florida also seeing increase cases though Agreed angry first think done lot absolve herself, certainly expressing (I hope) genuine concern [Co-infection already EU shot averaging 150 deaths day much summer well 1,500 deaths day now, proportionally similar current US fatality numbers. (446 million population vs 328 million). think see double end November, even though much Europe locking now.

Europe whole (740 million population) gone mostly 400 deaths day pushing 3,000 day, proportionately similar US. Still voting Trump. best could. Glad behind us. Think might happened without stable genius helm. Finally means approximately 1.085% Covid-19 infections reported United States reported 284th day since first case report United States.

(Numbers Worldometers.com published time comment.) Yes it’s basically impossible correctly predict something grow exponentially crosses certain threshold. Plus verify effectiveness containment measurements there’s 10-14 day latency involved. How'd support citizens lockdown? Halloween party company tonight probably going club (not affected country). Going long one.  Yes. outbreak, pandemic ongoing roughly 8 months.

*Who could possibly seen coming?* non-election year, get argument staying job trying steer ship away iceberg.

In middle election, though, think quit speak directly voters warn iceberg.

Look Fauci. Trump totally gonna fire Fauci second wins re-election. quit get campaign trail? looking exponent -- multiplies. 

At 1.10 double 7 * {critical time} latter incubation times -- around 10-14 days.

At 1.21 doubles 3.5 days.

*** 

There sudden ""now must concerned!"" number. worst yet come - countless college students come home holidays. IIRC people predicting back June May we'd hit 100k cases per day? Overrun hospitals beginning. already happening listen various local news outlets. Defunding seems dangerous idea. 
But system elects judges, chief police mayor needs lot independent oversight get together maintain power bases. Umm, yeah? Realizing government abject failure tough pill swallow. Flex tape ain't gonna fix it. doctor

This correct statement post. Vitamin synthesized body sun exposure. remember literally hundreds studies, many contradicting other. Hey nice big Thanksgiving Christmas gathering year pay off. Less presents guests invite following years, it'll save money! Obviously school risky mask buy coffee minor sacrifice, even called that. Turn back, corner bullshit Ohio here. second started protesting whining spooked away Dr Acton, governor lost spine. surprisingly well start now? Nothing repetitively begging people wear masks socially distance. Except folks need hear won’t listen, every day break records. We’re trouble. Know limits go public indicated. It’s harm vs benefit risk assessment many others physicians face daily. casual outsider opinion, gone wide open public back April-May. Nah you’re good, solid interaction. two people minimally disagreeing normal stuff trying figure COVID out, different typical interaction lol. Stay safe there. averaging 1k day last several days. sure that’s declining. Maybe that’s another country. Always aboard Bueno! still shocked accurate model author uses machine learning make projections. stopped updating October 5. curves shown page, projected numbers tables frozen since date. initially skeptical dramatic rise new cases several models predicting since September, time, evidence would happen. models, like IHME model predicting there'd 400,000 deaths end year looked aggressive even now. Youyang Gu's model linked amazed accuracy. wish would continue model, said site one-man job things work on. Part thinks quit predictions still good. lot uncertainty steeply cases/deaths grow, depends much human behavior machine learning models can't anticipate. temperatures warm, government policies consistent many months, making projections fairly 'easy'. I’ve reoccurring nightmares either I’m public realize I’ve forgotten mask I’m wearing mask stuck crowd maskless people. gatherings... go hahah make ass outta making assumption... true all. midtown I'd say mask compliance around 70%, downtown like 30%. loads people unmasked idk, least got another surge May, Beijing tested quarantined every single person entire city week, 8 million them. makes sense ignore 1+ billion asians wearing masks. height western hubris assume tribe smart right wearing masks asians stupid wrong so. It’s fake sense it’s used definitive count new cases. statistic real, implied (and we’re honest) majority “casually informed” individuals believe be.

If we’re looking better statistic, percentage positive vs negative tests you’ll find it. It’s without flaws, follows death trend lot closer “new cases” does. don’t hear used, “deaths per day” isn’t used paints far less dramatic picture situation, bad click rates.  absolutely will. Suddenly they'll treat covid serious thing ever, attack Biden daily, horse shit. Fox news salivating disgusting fucking mouths waiting another democrat president rail act like victims 24/7 Wait 101,000 people positive 988 people died today alone? So, know there's conflict interest way CARES act pays hospitals per patient, evidence hospitals fudging numbers it? World's Dumbest Criminals. Bold assume Trump supporting shitwhistles read.

They're voting they're awesome thinking, evaluating data making adult decisions. stubborn holiday travel huge problem early days still mostly local thing China?

I could sworn remembered hearing news potential infectees refusing cancel travel plans end December something.  Biggest one-day increase..... tomorrow beyond horrific, think biggest thing widespread is, even lack response government - factored in. indifference. People changing behave. Every previous surge significant change people dealt least, sheer apathy terrifies me. Oh Americans understand sarcasm? Well done, you. \*chants\* USA, USA, USA one guys leader country, ability get things done without political barriers, would 1st 3 things would do?

I start

1. National lockdown
2. Unemployment extension impacted
3. Listen scientists take appropriate action (s) seems like pretty serious news. covid starts jumping animals well watch literally entirely new population millions individuals. # WE'RE NUMBER ONE death rate seems (tragically) stabilised 230k? scary think what's come especially trump mocking mask wearers treating virus seriously positivity rate gives idea much cases going unreported. positive rate high suggest many positive showing severe symptoms prioritized testing. orgies bet win?! think won! Fellow Marylander. Hogan fucked second left counties... can't see authorizing another stay-at-home order shit hits fan winter We're number one! We're number one! Edit: NVM apparently yellow orange close tired eyes lol White privilege. usually slows hits testing wall. tests, problem, like Trump GOP like it. Yep, lockdown sight worse numbers compared pre-lockdown spring. great! also slow viruses generally spread waves, countries 2nd wave US. However policy certainly dictates bad waves significant ""yoyoing"" back forth is.

**With Spanish flu pandemic, 2nd 3rd waves initial one killed everyone.** True feel same. Someone another thread saying equivalent 680000 cases United States every day. sure believe number I've seen lock Instagram next days (I know using anyways). many people follow consider friends parties tonight tomorrow. 

Meanwhile I'm inside Animal Crossing virtual Halloween friends tonight internet. Tomorrow spent indoors. Girlfriend going sit around watch horror films.

Halloween favorite holiday. I'm person who's always dressed black year-round. full sized Freddy Krueger apartment. stay home, you.  Anyone treats pandemic like pandemic fucking better people treat like joke.

Period. I’m 8months leaving house curbside pickups

Are cereal? keep mind lot people lot mean option even wanted it. Hell halloween parties spread shit hardcore. 😬 big motorcycle rally long ago South Dakota. spreading North South Dakota nearby states every since. even talking about, biggest wave deaths April never got bad. back governors horrifically forcing covid patients stay nursing homes know exponential growth works? Always buy afford it. Especially young. Plus masks aren’t 100% effective- wear mask still infected someone else didn’t wear mask. None perfect solution nobody ever claimed was, stacking mitigation factors reduces risk. 

It’s unlike contraception actually, Condoms like 87% successful used properly, stacking birth control methods minimizes likelihood pregnancy. Similarly masks aren’t 100% successful stack distancing, parties wearing masks combined risk much lower. Tomorrow Halloween, already see crowded parties happening country. Glad live NYC, high number new cases get? 😰 We’re 15 cases, soon we’ll 0  Incredibly unfortunate Trump recovered now. France new lockdown. might come 3 months? That's pretty impressive think it.

Over 4000 cases every hour day. 

You go work 9-5, time finished shift, cases recorded Australia ever had. BIG CROWDS! Please forget love, compassion empathy. ""

Yeah, I'll work that. meantime, work regional hospital Oklahoma common thing coming COVID wards ""But Trump said FAKE!""

Which fine them, heartbreaking they've dragged families them. add death rate slowed people fighting covid flu time. USA #1! dumb. post get blocked saying grade got highschool, guess one? start blocking letters alphabet think gone far. 101 Biggest one day increase far I’m huge fan testing well 6 MILLION recovered.  somehow still doubt last time we’ll read headline “biggest one day increase record” idiot knows nothing, I've made much worse thought could

\- Donald J Trump Trump fuckers tired winning, yet? high positive test rate mainly indicates insufficient testing Well that’s grim I'm metro Atlanta, hospitals funeral homes managing keep means there's Problemo!  sounds like challenge. USA number #1 else never great again. welcome current year, live imagination ignore part reality want true. Could imagine working get nanoscopic resolution photos using TEM coronavirus, told virus ""may may exist""? lmao illegal immigrants maybe getting healthcare?! GUNS? ABORTION? 

Fucking boogeyman's idiots meanwhile actual crisis people dying give fuck. mean reply comment Aren’t potential vaccines produced right millions they’re approved rolled out? thought US already purchased hundred million (or maybe more?) doses moderna vaccine. Yes, won’t available quick say select March seems low end I’ve read online. Yes, 15 Xinjiang. get news Facebook memes? Maybe explain 300k deaths year average.

Maybe explain mother law’s friend died last week medically induced coma week happened asthma.

The disease real. Go fucking hospital see they’re dealing every single day. Almost 100k day? hell? Yup, 101,461 I'm gonna teaching remotely home goddamn ever, I? hard reality accept. Trump administration plan action. want people get virus. claim makes immune way fight virus herd immunity people contracting virus becoming immune dying. 

This way political assertion. plan advocating perpetuating. also ignoring local restrictions exist many people may gather public place. Waaagh let hundreds thousands american citizens die waagh  USA #1  Uh, elected people mistakenly think First Amendment permission put beliefs facts reality.

That's how. True, would've done lockdowns right way beginning we'd much better right now, would probably even pandemic fatigue. see graph national cases national deaths NYT website: (scroll individual state data)

Why start seeing dramatic increase deaths already cases exponentially increasing since mid-September? happening, paying attention. emergency rooms can't admit patients hospital ship patients places, that's big failure hospital achieve. Remember McCain gave classy concession speech? Haha. Trump ability admit defeat.

He going lamest ducks. least competent leadership Contagion. many fucking idiots Thank tough conversation kids. isn’t easy necessary ever. around world

Lmfao speak America saw first one even finished middle aged, young college aged people high schoolers 0.00001 chance dying it. Yes, Democrats always get blame. Even GOP base knows Republican member government competent enough treated like adult held accountable. new zealand 7 new cases today. think that. Trump said virus over. killed father law March

I feel impotent rage Give us freedoms get sick. says, ""Baby,
It's 3 must lonely.""
When says, ""Baby,

That's...... good hoped though.... 1/e. ~= 0.72

[Not sure say wife’s work test entire facility every week including residents maybe 1000 people 20 positives 1 symptoms rest spouses test negative never symptoms. symptoms common think lot false positives. shocked long testing took area lack rapid test. Testing still come long way  That’s numbers posted include rapid tests. numbers lot higher what’s shown. must know like one case🤷‍♂️  agree. I'm thankful quick rapid tests available around country! anyone ELI5 cases increases lot death cases remained range? better treatment protocol? Better drugs? Yeah you’re right, I’m cynical mood right lol Christmas though. want experience kids first Christmas. 100 percent agree comment deserve get downvoted. fair point, actually pessimistic, since arguing Covid deaths underestimated. Adding point, flu way little international travel. hate use bible nasty crap. I’m fine - rest world fearmongering shit hole like Reddit comprised Karens scream cry every time someone leaves house - fun living cave! 

I’m putting anyone risk :) also due range hundreds years though. might see next week next century. Many people die flu, anyones fault? Maybe blame Trump too! didn’t honestly think 100k possible. Someone saying anything wrong really saying anything all, playing safe. wanted say that, Idahoan behalf fellow Idahoans, batshit crazy horrible. quarter--okay, third--of us batshit crazy, dumber-than-a-garden-implement, brainless morons mostly communicate moderately evolved system grunting mainline crazypants propaganda sources like Joey Chestnut takes hotdogs remaining two-thirds us really normal rational thinking people appalled inescapable grossness displayed regular basis several, er, elected officials brain-melting disregard basic truths common sense. promise. terrible, horrible, no-good, bad Lt.

Worldometer number today 101,461 Lol don’t get upset “candidate” can’t even perform simple functions. Where’s hunter? built cages? Ehh fairness it’s correct way report sort relative change number, whether pay raises, housing price depreciation, number new people hospital beds due global pandemic.  movie COVID-23. OP said COVID-21. 'Murica! wait May continue avoid filthy Covid foreseeable future. I'm sorry see USA (states) locking except liberal ones. President authority especially 6-3 Conservative SCOTUS currently. I'm saying like it, I'm saying going happen. Dem leaning states lock again, purple red not. already going scorched earth. knows can't win. three rallies day every one , trying make followers think covid actively discouraging mask usage. working hard infect many people possible Inauguration Day. Maybe thinks ""herd mentality"" plan work, discouraging mask usage even fell love radiologist Scott Atlas.  Revolution federal government point governor can’t do? Infection rates spike different areas different times, can’t mandates done local level best tailored meet local populations needs. think also sad Australian. last months sure built us vs mentality states. cunt us extreme version it. I've even seen comments Melbourne hoping states another phase

Doesn't help federal government playing favourites need realise mortality rates trailing indicator. Meaning current death rates reflect infection spread several weeks ago. So, increase like infection rate delay. Two amendments read.

They treat constitution way treat Bible. means whatever dude like dais says  always laugh bad faked numbers. happened first couple months outbreak hundreds cases zero deaths. CCP miracle. occur? Well vaccination efforts go well top large levels acquired immunity fall/winter wave... Probably sometime 2021, maybe 2022 worst. 

I herd immunity supporter. really exist Coronaviruses. time reinfections antibodies stuff blown proportion media sources looking fear clicks. virus probably always circulate level, fall/winter worst likely behind us, especially vaccination efforts go well. 

This virus deadly novel. people it, bodies tricked thinking vaccination, novel super deadly virus. know infection triggers durable tcell/bcell immunity response, vaccines same. even sterilizing immunity antibodies wears off, average immune system much better prepared fight infection future. reinfections become widespread (which signs far) majority asymptomatic mild likelihood. fits they're seeing among dozens reinfections. Thanks, too!!

Yeah, quite ridiculous. one last states cases, one worst. realize state goes waves different times, I'm pretty sure we're still one worst terms cases/100k. sister CO tested least twice. think might test claim can't go back work unless negative, definitely can't get tested sake getting tested, like case. maddening. Luckily work administration manufacturing plant, can't risk plant cutting production, anyone work home allowed to. hospital can't even treat covid proper ventilation. need admitted covid, least hour drive. hope gets well soon without complications.  Similar W’s declaration mission accomplished regarding operation Iraqi Freedumb What's reason massive surge everywhere? I'm bit confused Nero something something. Busted! Maybe Taiwan country? 23 million might sound massive that's typical size average provinces China. Guangdong alone 113 million. looked projections, proven past 8 months. Even cases rising, average deaths steadily dropped. interesting projection stats though. hope case.  Unbelievable-first world country? Lets ride crazy train way hell🤪 finally opinion governments/political/health leaders almost bearing pandemic evolves. Portugal government dancing around constitution, passing free movement restrictions mask mandating and, soon, curfew laws, similar (adapted population) numbers US.
Of course I'm american, I'm sorry appropriate, matter who's charge, things go way are, matter who's charge. Everyone, time, knows virus spreads, us, anyone else. sweet....fresh meat. basically areas hit bard hit hard.

Why national lockdown then? need put end anti science mother fuckers cant even leave country skiing sounds nice. think it'll like scene True Detective Rust driving whole drug flashback, instead lights blurring past, Covid news headlines clips Among Us. Totally agree. point though, think need 2-3 week lockdown nonessential businesses ""reset."" reopen masks must absolutely worn perhaps restaurants permitted offer take while. also need test everybody frequently we've stamped virus. explain going get worse winter months? seen specific reason lock would less effective control pandemic, NEED authoritarianism.

It's authoritarianism anyway elected leadership take democratically supported positions, even there's dumb vocal minority makes giant deal dragged kicking screaming 18th century views germ theory.

If minority opinion loses vote, authoritarianism enforce law. literally democracy. Morons want force pandemic over. goal always maintain level infection a) allows local healthcare systems able cope, b) sustains much economic activity possible without overwhelming hospital systems. national lockdown country size USA never made sense still doesn't. However, national response still necessary virus care state border lines. 

One thing I've curious large cities currently risk hospitals overran moment, rural problem moment cities seen large outbreaks. typical novel viral pandemic, would nowhere near herd immunity moment, far appears large cities large outbreaks clusters earlier year second waves could compete first waves. makes seem like places like New York already ""over hump,"" speak, mysteriously inexplicably experiencing second rounds shutdowns. anyone know exceptions this? areas today uncontrollable outbreaks spring, instance? Ah don’t understand science difference gender sex. get vaccine quicker? didn’t President Obama shit Katrina COVID? Checkmate, libtards. 🤣 Imagine thinking population magically changed since 2019. stunted? mean honestly...

Private jet - them
Equestrian competition - horse yourself

Bouncy house - kids mouthbreathers superspreading other.

Are admitting you’re stupid compare two situations evaluate obvious differences admitting you’re sociopath tosses language around like yesterdays jam little regard words mean want derail convo addressing bullshit?

Which it, bub? seriously lockdown even though several countries going lockdown Monday? see spiking significantly holidays. Families going gather sure. USA, USA! /s sure makes China totalitarian regime? beat covid19 back April we're opening (slightly) Victoria. anyone good resources explaining to/showing family getting together Thanksgiving might best idea year? mother law texted whole family ask day would celebrating - “hey talk Thanksgiving plans year light exploding pandemic.” husband tried explain didn’t think great idea - literally one family responded, assume weren’t happy said. frustrating. feeling may staying home/zooming rest get together... considering Belgium hit 700k per day adjusted population, I'd say excellent chance 200k/day point. almost lasted minute Jones website, like like 53 seconds.

38s exact. 37s many. Hillary Clinton paid dossier used impeach Trump. Ever wonder never mentioned anymore? sure got information don’t think anyone advocating controlled exposure... Sweden taking lax approach changing Still hard get tested rural areas. Need multiple symptoms (including fever) pre-op situation. agree US. saying two weeks full lockdown life usual. I'm saying know spike coming lockdown would help us get ahead , control exposure take pressure infrastructure. Idk , I'm expert countries done fairing much better surely better pretending exist (I know you;re advocating seems plan rn) can’t even spell “herd” right dumb mother fucker Well...at least buy school supplies money now? 😉 Ok fair could lot things, like maybe encouraging people wear masks. Mask compliance really problem state, open bars, restaurants, gyms.. already pretty much announced earlier week they've given trying control it. Probably skyrockets control time Biden take over. Thank u make much sense me.. upvote shit deletes figure also includes 5.5k cases acquired overseas detected arrival Australia.

Aaand figure significantly higher could 2 governmental fuck ups. America #1 nation world former glorious nation Kazakhstan. Lol - heck?? KEEP POURING GASOLINE FIRE 

Goddamnit Turning coroner? Oh no... Lol Back conservative go. Maybe it’s finally time that. know wouldn’t mind finally letting loose fuckers. mean, ever seen Hillary room Covid? *I think so* Good thing deaths least stabliizng. USA! USA! USA! Glory supreme leader Trump. magnificent visage radiate pure ultraviolint solar plexus beams vaporice coronatoids seek invade nostroses implant evil footies pulmonary pumps. Let known words spread troof, lest vile thoughts fester. Dear China: Please help. feel US government betrayed us seems nothing it. Early pandemic, USA done Taiwan South Korea did. seems late US Europe. sucks mother's boyfriend cop aka Trump cult follower cops are..well yeah know. 

And I've met 3 times. Seems like nice guy talk mom tell he's rubbing sad. put Trump flag house GF pull last weekend see new house almost puked..

My father would rolling grave right now. I'm sure voted care either way he's type says ""Bidens America riots everywhere"" ect ect

Just morons even feel like visiting mom and...it fucking sucks Well, might rightfully skeptical death counts, trend lines [previous reporting know correct conclusion virus necessarily safer much vulnerable populations already taken out. Maybe virus mutated less lethal variant? 

It's hard say, one way another, hopeful we're seeing rising death counts. someone says “in itself”, usually mean something along lines “by nature”. It’s quite thing saying “that thing alone” since it’s often use show subject could caused outcome still somehow contributed outcome. 

An example I’ve seen several times necktie not, itself, cause strangulation.

Compared necktie cause strangulation. 

The first one shows necktie factor death, whereas second seemingly rules completely. 

That said, phrase rather old, language evolves. I’ve often seen phrase used emphasis subject completely apart rest. believe that’s case here, they’re trying say medical advice likely sound even aspects way she’s presented/handled not, shouldn’t getting much hate thing made could keep giving medical advice. that’s extremely unlikely. Also hutterite/mennonite colonies hit pretty badly.  really know stop spread state. I'm pretty pissed governor done shit lately though. announced reopening schools day state hit record daily cases. know Trump do, release stimulus? Maybe stop asshole? know governor power nothing. Orwellian draconian imo. unbelievably cursed. lord knows T\*ump loses Tuesday he's going double-triple-quadruple calling Coronavirus h\*ax created 'gina presidency.

Whatever. don’t even care anymore. going fucking die. doomed. turning back. Say goodbye everyone know. Republicans killing us. Democrats started virus. Fuck fuck me. 

Did cover everything? Jacobin, Intercept, Unicorn Riot, Guardian (occasionally) many others. Honestly anything cable news WAPO, obviously anything right point like Fox such. They're propaganda point. 

Most importantly, look history words use. constantly used words ""hack elections"". fucking hack elections. posted memes troll accounts. Thats hacking election.

Look forward November's record breaking 100k single day increase Lol mean common cold right? Sorry hear that. USA number 1! Yeah, can’t force people care others. perfectly clear, May DOH said fewer FIVE deaths said clearly misattributed. are, five plus months later, smooth brained morons like using five cases one state’s reporting act like whole thing hoax. personally know people died this, asshole.

Outbreaks highly localized mobility fairly limited right -- lot folks traveling outside metro area, especially outbreak zones. look zones major outbreaks, pattern seems 4-10 weeks intense community transmission, environment becomes significantly less target rich remaining potential victims take increased precautions, new case rate falls.

We major outbreak July-August, since people went back life usual including crowds bars restaurants, unmasked table service course, seen significant uptick even kids came back big university. rapid, mostly asymptomatic spread university, pretty much radio silence. Poor SARS2 hell time finding hosts -- We've got 1.2 million people, new case average 88/day 18/day hospital admissions -- people partying like another day. Simply put, we're target rich environment anymore.

Depending regional outbreaks play out, could see either widespread intense period outbreaks longer, staggered period localized intense outbreaks.

Either way, expect thing transition endemic, seasonal virus spring, potential significant suppression year vaccine widely deployed period.

The important thing remember intense community transmission period run length limited, winter worst. focus get without getting infected, especially high risk. high risk individual, protecting overly cautious obtain vaccination key. avoid admitted.

I knew live degenerate state. add election Thanks saying this. I’ve feeling guilty allowing 5 year old go trick treating. However went bed excited Halloween. mom (mostly mom) set Halloween scavenger hunt result getting basically Easter basket hollowed style. 

We also baking various Halloween treats synching Disney+ Halloween movie grandma. also blast carving pumpkins tonight. 

You’re right, kids resilient. False dichotomy. I'm interested hearing more. Patriot Act views say enough trump elected may see 500k days, maybe 1M nana grandpa used set Hot Wheels track would slide candy stairs front door. kids loved it. dont like right many deaths be. And? know people gotten it. It’s hoax. track exact statistics hospital. Increase positivity (for non-pre-procedure cases) generally predicts increase inpatient census 10 days. 12% die 8 days later. scary thing may well mean it. Trump big adherent ideas [Norman Vincent essentially ""self help"" type minister advocated belief positive thinking create reality. essentially genesis prosperity gospel. 

I'd always assumed Trump saying stuff political expedience seems he's actually total irrationalist actually concerning. probably saved someones life. Thanks.  hmm. would say wearing costume resembling microscopic structure covid-19 causing coronavirus sans mask good Halloween costume idea? This, kind comment right US shape is. actually know anything China read hear media government? know anyone Chinese China? realize information US pumps countries propaganda best interest right? Thank you. Getting tested tomorrow afternoon. 230K going grow lot winter :( Jersey here. boat. know one person passed blind see many health issues. I'm convinced passed ""Covid"". copium article? I'm handing candy... table far away me. what's issue? perfect timing this. totally believe  Yep, watch potential long term effects unknown people straight saying pandemic, that’s ignoring science. things, hey, don’t even believe exists, truly denying science wanted add washing candy appeal you, let sit untouched days. Keep spare candy hand kids enjoy immediately shithole country Times like grateful live first world country like Australia 😊 Oh makes mad. parents grew republican they’re Fox News die hards. manufacturing goes went China. making lot money. think trickled down? hired kids it’d cheaper could make money. Nah. Earth that. Mount Mazama (Crater Lake) grew island. erupting time soon. India give US run number 1. America can't let happen. Turning corner right? Almost gone. Like even there. We’re 1000+ day already bud  wish well. too. Oh... dumb grandma? Great-grandpa? then, wear mask. wave hits Europe first hits US going fucking nuts. all, well aware. turns America hot dumb jock eventually ends fat drunk loser There're plenty non chinese sources backs china's numbers choose ignore them. I'll give hint, go take look korea's import cases past months, compare numbers China US EU, take look amount people enters Korea every months.

EU, Japan, Singapore opened chinese citizen, think intelligence agencies shit cant detect active outbreak? Lmao ""the orange shield."" Good Lord folk much. Come close hitting 6 figures! also live Melbourne, fan science, and... GO AUSTRALIA!!! 1 case VIC today! Science brave leaders win. whingers VIC want say, ""WHAT 40k, 50k, 80k, 100k daily infections UNDERSTAND"" USA. near 0% chance anything place prevent going. No, jerk guns. guns self preservation. survival rate 99%... I’ll take chances. friend 400lbs extremely unhealthy survived this. Go go go! everyone scrambling figure lockdown solutions peak 70k. karma , whine it. someone neglects endangers people deliberately...shit happens. telling take walk? Get yourself. relative normal authoritarianism? Nah. first couple months, UK highest death rate well. anymore course, long while. Winter coming positivity rate high well Dude went Disneyworld couple weeks ago people baby. wife thought cute said dad asked old. dad said ""thanks! 3...weeks old."" mom never really looked us talked us. 

My wife care much like like wtf. wife thought crazy though. stayed home 2 months straight. ""judgy"". Pandemic would bring 3 year old anywhere.

&amp;#x200B;

And yeah know us going WDW irresponsible we've every single thing took slow. wife works southwest airlines huge expense. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway yeah fuck bringing baby around people. I've heard many horror stories. Fight way would cold flu? Trump highlights absolute worst country extent I'm thankful know needs cleaned gone. American perspective China mind-blowing. lived years, felt much safer American cities.

My run-in police traffic ticket, even nice charged three points six point violation. 100 million people elevated risk due underlying conditions age. I'll see Russian Roulette championship, friend! Good luck! win believe luckier everyone else. Korea, KCDC making statement since forever, they’ve largely correct. It’s risk tolerance. big issue work I’m around 75 high risk individuals. makes personal risk tolerance low. 

If you’re low risk, people frequently come contact low risk, don’t see need avoid gatherings immediate family. Follow local guidelines though, I’m scientist. American exceptionalism, baby. cases exponentially increasing, they've always (and higher numbers) tested. increased slightly, fraction percent, past weeks. Death rates / hospitalization continue  Mostly true though makes us look uncivilized compared countries tough lockdown. mostly successful able return relative normality everyone would agree wear mask. Really? pay attention leaders saying china burned thousand sit bodies? Coronavirus: ""You could live failure, bring you? Back me"" Today did. Worldometer 101,000 new cases today Oh No. 

Anyway it, guys! Congratulations! Winning! Americans obviously. matter singular person says point. 8 months ago, sure. that? Nah. That's takes set new record later... 100k+ cases fucking day country opening opening borders US covid test required Nov 1st. Nah. Hilary Clinton politicized masks. takes special kinda recklessness that. Basically max. guess we'll see headline NEW RECORD # TESTS!!! tomorrow? Nah, record number positives know... positivity rate X, number positives tests number tests * rate.... means meaningless e r headline, yeah dooooooommmer banned hahahaha How? hiding statistics. Fucking thank man. saw median age details really put perspective.

Not downplaying Covid insane they’re pushing study reason suspect get brain damage following Covid. agree. expected bit slanted one balanced articles I’ve read quite while. Well done Washington Post. care case numbers long deaths clearly incorrectly reported. way american health care system already broken number cases, obese already sick people preexisting conditions. listened Trump. stop testing case number drop dramatically! Trump wins, he’ll outlaw news organizations talking Covid. outlaw news organizations. Rookie numbers. Anyone current survival mortality rates United States? Pls stop difficult 

Regards, Finland 🇫🇮 love American haters. Laughing stock world people literally get wait lists years opportunity come here. 

You really take pride millions others would sacrifice much it. shit show don’t flip senate blue. do, Democrats move impeach Trump Pence either damage. removed office, Pelosi reins Biden takes office. 

If something president, people die, 90,000 people assuming stay rate 1k people day. 

The important thing flip senate. Whether Biden wins. wutang shivers hit like momma's clam chowder. Yeah worst case scenario basically. kind pilgrimage worst part outbreak...2021 ain't looking good either Sure....but risks higher others failed realize dumb anti science people suits them. ""What else could Trump done"" get literally try discuss governments abyssal failure contain pandemic parents. Fuck Fox news Facebook. 

Let propaganda machines held partly responsible deaths. country, snap election one state. caused total cases spike -~10-20 day ~700-1000 day. Death rates 0-1/day 3-4/day.. [archive link anyone trouble accessing article Can’t wait 2021 said closer. close Funny quite significant percentage people still follow administration better words god. Almost symptom rather disease country suffering. Percent positive isn’t really relevant factor imo.

It’s skewed testing capacity increasing decreasing well regulations get tested changing. it’s showing percentage people tested positive chose get tested anyway. It’s random sampling community all. 

I mean, shows testing capacity, negative tested person easily become positive hour later could hour earlier. make contact later day.. 

It shows percentage people choosing get tested, aren’t likely ones insurance little money among risk exposed either. I’ve always found curious metric.

It makes sense conjunction CFR, IFR, total cases per day, week, rolling avg, per capita, really look get decent idea what’s going ground. 

Imo every person chooses get tested, there’s several decide don’t need one. I’m healthcare supervisor, you’d shocked many people turn free tests know they’ve exposed. Getting staff get anti body tests like pulling teeth. got 4 75 get tested four came back anti bodies. 3 knew though. goes show little many people care.

And I’m nyc less! one places people care most, still won’t use sanitizer, wear masks common areas without constantly reminded. Though I’ll admit, mask compliance gotten good last month so. Pretty much everyone wears now, took 6 months twisting arms.  South Korea 100 cases day it’s headlines. US 100 THOUSAND cases day, we’ve “turned corner.” days it’s hard believe isn’t nightmare. Yea, let's wait little longer till hospitals completely overflow causing people die without healthcare available. Surely great peoples lives mental health around  Math says no, 9.3M   FACTS LOGIC totally SLAMMING covid pandemic probably say yes certain circles. reduce testing civil war starts Rip immune system cornbread Yes. agree. point was, could lot worse likely guess good artist requires empathy, something Republicans have. appreciate enthusiasm topic.

On probability 10k day feb/march, give take exceptional issues treatment collapse due infrastructure delays appropriate meds used protocol, and/or oxygen resupply issues, and/or medical interventionists (doctors/senior nurses). COVID real far politicized. keep seeing whole thing less year old, swear feels like news 2014. 48 years too! Remember states like Florida restricting testing people showing symptoms well. multiple damaging long term health effects possible catching it. death concern people this. wee’s jolly good fellows!.... Well, would awful, thankfully appears extremely unlikely scenario based information currently available. Yes tho I'm glad family really, really small town returned. I'm hoping Mexico well places I've stayed fairly open air breezy IMHO help prevent COVID. Yay? We're argument. think even trying right now?


I care say. Framing people's concerns Patriot Act 'whiny' says much you.


You notice comment said interested hearing initially? I'm longer interested engaging either, nice weekend. People say want Chinese Government, Chinese people damn good job getting virus control. didn’t turn mask wearing political issue, already quite common wear mask sick protect others. could order grocery's necessities delivered house bet many others literally house time bad mental health. Much like kids home social interaction bad social intellectual growth. american either, I'm guessing us October February. getting shit answers.

The RAW TOTAL positive tests going number tests performed going up. Period, end.

R0 (positivity rate) fraction percent higher lowest point weeks ago, death rate lowest point ever Though could easily twice many people tested Go team. hit 150k. believe you!   gone die Still, 46.1% voters voted him. 48.2% voted Clinton. recall back early days, like march april, everyone panic-buying staying home, whatever. 

then *somebody* draw political lines we’re fucked. Well brother Mom died month ago. 

I also finding people talk either close family members it. Much asked people knew months back. deaths = less demand = less jobs = worse economy. Also deaths = actual real people dying. WTF actually wrong you? It’s legit delayed till 2022? US informed world instead NATO last November, prohibit domestic testing March

i.e. US choose protect human life instead trying frame first country test

But worry, people held responsible, China knows, China hold US accountable Wall mold likes this. “Those mostly elderly people multiple illnesses would’ve dead COVID weren’t around.”

Quite leap, hardly something could considered “true” statement. Unless, course, you’re omniscient, case, pardon ignorance majesty. one blaming trump virus. Trump blame response. wait tomorrow supposed know? 

Unless actually contact trace asymptomatic, really know. Mortality rate models ranging 0.25 2% seem equally valid. Im gonna honest, numbers don’t mean lot hardly leave house. could say 1 million cases day would still shrug. many people getting it, where’s share? Jokes aside, think it’s pointless shutdown. Contact tracing also pointless infection rates high. one know COVID. don’t see numbers high. US fucked lot reasons, reason we're pushing towards civil war lot foreign interference sure kind words bring comfort OP. go join ass, Trump Jr. proclaiming coronavirus nothing \*you\* personally affected.

&amp;#x200B;

People like make sick. SARS2 control/containment status U.S.= UNCHECKED? States opening back it’s naturally flu season viruses live easily. Maybe things get better February Biden takes Trump going shit. stutter? :v better countries. There's much outside wait elections. Biden wins Dems sweep Senate, Abbott immense pressure actually allow county judges shut deem necessary. mom freaking sent text assets I'd get die dad's coworker tested positive. Apparently since open season dad upped life insurance day found out. anyone know tested? feel party-protecting lie incoming. deaths going though upside ""Biggest one day increase""

Well see yall tomorrow Ah okay, fair enough tough then. 

But even 50 million people got doses thats still 15% entire US would vaccinated. Right total there’s 3% country got covid (officially). would big difference think. that’s US 100 million doses they’ve already paid U.S. 100 million cases time we’re through. Nearly 1 3 Americans contract COVID.

With luck, we’ll 10% way week two. forget idiots STOPPED USPS sending masks every household didn’t get masks? plan never fully implemented. Apparently White House said something effect “oh won’t” USPS. Washington Post article quoted administration official saying, “There concern White House Domestic Policy Council office vice president households receiving masks might create concern panic.” Halloween voting top things worried now. Especially voting. Everyone standing line shoulder shoulder masks all. vote safety comfort house. glimpse beginning trumps 4 years. He’s got go! #voteHimOut think interesting last 10 months we've seen several different strains. heard coronavirus' hard make vaccines shift much frightening. fucked evil people be?! shot libtards. freedom infringed upon. Yeah though look pretty dumb pointing many people blame Germany him.  Got make sure praise go Premiers though, think I've heard single thing Scotty that's useful. news absolute travesty well. consider adding mental health hotline comments like this, jesus fucking christ. ok though Trump administration ended pandemic 🙄

What fucking moron Every fucking day biggest increase. Stay home. masks. Shut bars, restaurants, etc instead winging there’s vaccine. It’s absurd. depressing, fucking brutal millions. Trump likely lose care enough sign another stimulus? prob not, cares Trump. Eviction protection ends Dec 31st. Many laid restaurants bars able stay open cold weather. control. source high quality content? dumbs want rentals run government? considered might possibly downside this? Stop American exceptionalism bullshit pretend reason country fucked foreign interference. wise man learns others mistakes. Lots unwise people. please, someone something. Sometimes. Sometimes not. Depends location company. worked Jimmy John's Dallas. Got paid $9 hour, bumped $12 hour left (I PIC). Got 50¢ mile driven averaged $80 tips nights, would $100 cash end shift. Days, depending many drivers came in, would equal that, more. several shifts last summer alone brought home $150 cash. Also got free food drinks wanted.

Worked one Corpus Christi. paid minimum wage, never got pay bump, paid maintenance mileage. Never got free food drinks. Averaged $20 tips nights, less day shifts.

The best part? Dallas franchise cheaper delivery fee Corpus store.

Of course Dallas stores take Small Business loan, managed even pull cash hand hazard pay us (not much, like $100 pay check). Corpus Franchise took loan, stores closed June. see keep approach accepted restrictions applied. 

If think post reddit random poster news all, (especially never claimed anything, clearly stated belief) gullible.  call think FAKE NEWS hilarious.  True not, news fake news. 

Have good day. thing becomes endemic seasonal, adapts kill hosts, deadly either. infinirely better countries barely accept naturalization all.

e.g, Japan. use pen? I’ve never voted before, know bring pen? better that. USA Number 1 government officials stop house parties? people. Yeah isn’t good... cherry top person who's supposed leading us pedal metal fuck mode, already hit rock bottom terms disapproval pandemic response among us sane folks initiated cult.

 Trump nothing gain sort pandemic response point (in mind), supporters entrenched insane, twilight zone facade sort pandemic health measure somehow radical communism, destroying democracy, deficating constitution, whatever latest fiction they've invented excuse terrible, shitty human beings. There's going central guidance effort address this, huge fraction nation committed exact opposite what's needed. really can't believe true right now. big landlords buy properties raise rent account extra delinquencies.

That plan along. politicians know donors are. I've wondering too, think answer death rate low enough penatration yet real people. 

I maybe 5 high-risk people life super close to. None gotten it. know one person (friend parents never met) went ICU it.

I bet experience pretty typical. 

Most people know anyone serious bout virus. reality take losing someone close overcome combo propaganda wishful thinking.

People bad math. hear 1 percent chance dying say ""that's nothing - ill fine, even know anyone it!""

They run numbers equate 3+ Million deaths. Making records! Lolololololol kill please 😭 live America choose handle pandemic affects us, directly impacts life lived. ACTUAL FUCK would care countries handling it? retarded? math. Prorated 2019 census data, agree. limping along. places like New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, NFld whose population dense, whose people conservative behaviour follow rules set leaders weathering storm. Biden must need votes time hate. 

So appropriate time accountability? confess idk we're confrontational nowadays strict people. Good 70% isolating. tough

Let's please reserve rage people 0% isolating, April already loudly whining entitled rage people ignoring brutal pandemic. Lol yep, brand. [Here America apreciate work, trump. still empathy. Costa Rica Next time make comment making wild claims, learn back real sources. Otherwise come across tinfoil moron (apologies really one, everyone different suppose). Honestly amazed managed get 0, live Adelaide great see. Looking news shocking they're attacking successful lockdown Victoria, seriously want us like U.S. Thank fuck give damn Bay area. SF around .88%, 1.6% miles away live. still fear Thanksgiving Christmas though. looked China, supposedly hate, they’d see exactly doesn’t work. they’re labeled “communist” don’t see business ran republicans want run. least trump wants run. Zero regulations workers don’t get shit. frustrating.  Satsuma well enough without help Yes, immunity isn’t permanent, get steady state condition virus never burns out.  Yeah, Fuck. dont think internet view US states way European countries. Mabye thats you? 

From see US handling poorly people focusing individual states US residents (with good reason). guess I'm trying ask realistically accomplished based testing capacity.

Positivity rates US already stupidly high, rising again.

As I'd guess true rate new cases already much higher, ability test probably cap around 250k new cases per day. 

It seems new case doubling rate 100% per month, means 250k probably hit Christmas, particularly given orgy superspreaders known thanksgiving.

I see orange one imposing proper regulations loses. number deaths trending downward though, wish could get goods news sometimes One Russia’s biggest successes convincing US Cold War. confidently predicted yesterday would happen till next week earliest. 

Its already crossed 100K Lmfao. perhaps hits elderly hardest rest deaths spread out. want care absolutely can. look around everything seems normal. pandemic deadly enough rise people's attention. Ugh, I'm sorry. I'll start keeping eye numbers hope best guys. planet doesn’t care us. It’s inanimate object. Biden really able anything. states measures. Like Canada, federal government really set recommendations. provinces response. understand this. moon full. would anyone anything howl moon night? got Bill Nye deliver information Fauci we'd probably 80% mask compliance lol gotta love country Another nationwide shutdown?

When happen? I'm thinking long virus survive surfaces seems germ riddled kids hands candy bowls (as one example) encourages viral spreading.

But, know, I'm probably COVID nothing memory mid November. act current economy sustainable itself. real thing matters housing, food, water prices mass deaths best thing that. Nothing else comes close. 

I believe death bad thing think people think bad thing little sad depressing really, think logically, we're face mass extinction event, global economy sucks, global warming rise, humanity still hates one another. thing happy good life majority society. Death meanwhile absolute nothingness sure hell beats life. mean fuck much better sleep awake? undisputedly better. even facoting believe afterlives. wont get sad bothered people dying god I'd love die logical outcome. Stop getting fucking emotional can't think rationally life death. know, income gap part mentioned massive problem country well going get worse agree. Obviously going much worse country lower savings rate high dependence debt case US absolutely right. 

Honestly really hope federal reserve comes says every mortgage term extended period 12 months allows people breathing space required. 
Hoping light end tunnel everyone. Three rights make left. COVID very, low death rate people age. forcing people low chance dying, lives ruined. People going lose everything. country kind poor people. someone? cruel inhumane. can’t ruin life longer alive! //taps temple// average 0.01%. different flu You’re right looked bad source. Surprisingly it’s actually hard look up. addition definitely noticed 10k absurdly wrong number. non childfree friends: gonna take care you’re older?! Scenarios like great examples saying anti-maskers rose completely nothing influenced take extreme stance trivial thing? much success story? Even lockdowns, Sweden still fail. went hearing 1 2 people someone else knew someone got it. fiancee, coworker, coworker's gf, like 3 people know, getting inside last week. Yeah concerned ultimately October 19th literally first day opening like three people outside dropping tops. never going vote inside life me. shocking many people understand concept. Look Asia answers... anyone saying “they testing enough”... well... death rate overall deaths also low can’t hide bodies family members public day age (of internet). 

At rate, over... whether pandemic many pandemics course many decades.... they’ll last ones standing. win! Never assume intent stupidity explains it.

Thank you, detective u/PirateNinja. Case solved! U.S. fucking nuts. already I'm Québec , montreal exact countries hotspot. shit show here, 900-1100 cases day weeks restaurant, bars gyms closed.
  hope maritimes provinces keep provinces closed safe going get worse next-door sure exhausting. Like, really exhausting ... aware New Zealand part ""West"". Get help That's thing. law. county judge can't create law lol. might find difficult comprehend, US impacted events overseas. Things like global economic collapse stop US border. I've self-imposed lockdown (and working home) almost 8 months... I'm guy, absolutely floors I've avoided covid better Boris Johnson, better Trump, better Kemp. amazing resources disposal, presumably access cutting-edge research, yet went way get infected, I'm still winning game hide&amp;seem covid. mindblowing. Probably even then, COVID Treating going weekend. 

Black Friday might become US’s dia de los Muertos, instead day blowing monies stuffs things. That's wild me. live fairly rurally know multiple people contracted it. part country live in? make mistake thinking people power know exactly they're doing. Trump may well idiot, he's figurehead. people whispering ear moving things along actually know what's what. mean point do? information things could doing, fuck people listen. Invest people shaped boxes? 97,000 Thursday. Friday, number. 1000 more. wonder trick treating bring U.S. First Amendment. That's one says get whatever want. RIGHT? let's talk 2nd.  5 mill. think New York Times page summarizing reported cases colleges nationwide. think it’s started February nursing homes hotspot. positive cases we're testing more. People getting tested even though showing symptoms bumps test number death rate keeps getting lower. People show symptoms spread continues another 4 weeks, maybe. still time make changes keep deaths lowish. Yes it’s true democracies it. That’s west looks pathetic. perception Asia particularly China can’t. Actually that’s general perception west rest globe well unfortunately. Mission accomplished. 



Good job. 


We fucking it.  Last 3 days: [81k, 91, Assumed sarcasm, looked post history verify. Gotta say. People like us get exactly one comment lifetime r-conservative. use way did? one play left: hail mary.

#vote constitution basically two amendments long them, hopefully they’ll occasion get acquainted 5th time. work healthcare, fine. You’re ignorant. like coronavirus going go anywhere. It’s going hang around like flu right? healed isn’t eradicated century vaccine? estimated 200k dead time back February. 100% correct pandemic assumptions far except dumbass thought federal government would done something rather 200k dead numbers rising instead real pissed covid still thing get first gray pube.

You estimated? Based what? know? actually changed table restriction earlier month. 6 per table household restriction.

Source: Haha, go sleep. advantage antipodeans live island nations. Also arse end world? even mad. decide globe way up. Yes, allow it. level normalizing uncomfortable. still first wave, said. likely second wave OVERLAP first wave.

:) Yeah deaths actually trending downward since beginning. fluctuates day day, overall lower average countries stepping point help (take over)? Honest question. happening anywhere else United States, Canada, UK would stepping protecting people. seems like horrible unimaginable crime. Especially USA, HOLY SHIT fix election know react. (I'm Canadian) Help... Like, come on, election times. can't expect responsibility leaders election times. much important run around speak great are. fuck ton stayed home

 ""both sides"" Wow!! That's solid data! I'll forget everything else see Covid provided information need!!!! Thank much, intelligent person! worst sub reddit. wear masks, go trick treating . Stand back door, idiot answers door without mask, politely leave skip house. Social distance maintained. 


Are people confusing trick treating Halloween house party ? Don’t forget Black Friday, America’s favorite full-contact sport. Case numbers drop weekends, usually means Sunday Monday report day after. Wednesday Thursday usually top days. They’re saying cop would weigh heavier (1/4) actually (1/8) weighing baggie. way tack higher charge. hear is, ""It's right infect others deadly virus lack common sense empathy things clearly interest learning."" answer question. Also false. impact overall mortality, we'd excess deaths.  numbers important though, one other. test sick people postive percentage gonna skyrocket, countries test whenever. great. 

Funny Trump talks cases tests, one places seems true New York California. Look spread rate psychopathic fuck *yet*.

Just wait winter, literally cant go hospital. Number deaths per day different weeks ago, lower Based death certificate data, percentage deaths attributed PIC week 43 8.2% and, **while declining**, remains epidemic saying deaths dropping rapidly anything spiraling control comments seem believe. This! much this! can't even! Nobody advocating death dude. False Dichotomy Fallacy breh. ""Get asshole""

""...Where going?""

""The war Christmas"" Again, depends age group. age group current case numbers. Let's get details make calculation right. Knowledge communism. So, peak numbers? hope come alright.

the way ever going get slowed effective testing, tracing, short-term quarantining scheme (like south korea did).

Just telling people vaguely ""ya, meet anybody next year so, vaccine"" never going work. Trump hoping spike get bad enough election could get another 4 years. 

The broad strategy work stringent, widespread lockdowns. Never doubt progressive authoritarian dog whistles. Scary Godmother also good Halloween movie kids series free YouTube even pretend know truth what’s going on? American media partisan positivity rate essentially means nothing. Positives compared many tests irrelevant spread virus total case count. Federally, yea nothing point. “essentially”, simply nothing.

At State/Local Government level however...? Yeah. Florida work I’d say 40% customers mask on. store doesn’t even kick assholes out. Fucking shame. Hey everyone- person wants tell someone staying home keeping people around safe... go live life overreacting (Aragorn's opinion). must know person situation intimately. 

Wtf Aragorn. 

You know people's reasons staying in, kindly, mind business try make people feel bad life choices required keep others safe. Korea, Taiwan, New Zealand proven democracies overcome virus.  Hah hah street probably full trick-or-treeters tomorrow. Start holiday season bang. many times heard headline ""97,000"" replaced different number? Big Ben. Parliament. even trying say? 3 million active cases US right now. us first half.. gonna lie Taiwan shit together years. see there... Atleast Vaccine trials super well. like 100k people per day get it, easily prove vaccine works not. released guidance medical facilities stock pile PPE combat respiratory pandemic. outlined much type PPE facilities maintain (see ""Proposed Guidance Workplace Stockpiling Respirators Facemasks Pandemic Influenza""). 2008. Facilities 12 years get prepared, bottom line. NY became overwhelmed stories broke regarding nurses wearing trash bags bandanas masks, OSHA removed piece history website later replaced different guidance document 2008 removed lot language regarding PPE stockpiling. PURE negligence. Science changes time. article explains recommendations changed mandatory masks here. almost virus. Undefeated champions world voters every country someone died? right?! Never assume intent stupidity explains it. Don’t underestimate stupid morons are. Soo every days going see title bigger number. We'll beat Tuesday, tops. not. Deaths bottomed two weeks ago. week's death numbers 10% higher last week's. Deaths lag cases 2-4 weeks takes people get sick enough land hospital, go ICU, die, death properly registered. 100,000 new cases would correspond ~1,500 deaths day current levels testing. Expect numbers range weeks. rumors spreading US, here's doctor said response claim getting paid diagnosing ER physician want know: pick check? Where’s money that’s I’m supposed get diagnosing everyone Covid? next unending supply PPE every hospital now. supplies aren’t locked aren’t reusing masks day day maybe it’s place Regeneron Remdesivir is. know, medicine we’re using save normal regular folks still go work everyday can’t work home. back office rural hospitals, maybe it’s tents setting take overflow. that’s everyone’s dream right? die fucking tent richest country world. Maybe baby faced 18 year old National Guard member, never signed shit isn’t getting psychological counseling it’s over, maybe wait maybe sent house? house strip naked entering don’t infect kids. Maybe it’s there. God knows, wouldn’t know, live hotels call rooms. I’ve lived last 6 months we’re “turning corner” spinning circles like maladjusted psychotic dog one balls put it’s refrigerated truck. keeping money? know that’s we’re keeping bodies. bodies people happened diagnose Covid make couple extra bucks. Because, yeah, I’m life. That’s learned stupid medicine science. That’s dedicated life trying save people peddle bullshit mass super spreader event call political rally. fuck it? People going fucking bankrupt good fucking reasons smh. swear yall extremely privileged think 2 weeks working cause devastating consequences That's I've months. support nothing policy evolution intended. Conservatism virus Covid cure. Eat real food. helps significantly eat real food, fat cholesterol. helps absorption. mom takes pills bloodwork showed low Vit D. already impeached him, that’ll save bit time. Username *not* relevant Dont worry, El Paso must fine police dont seem worried /s governor locked almost every bar restaurant Illinois. Grocery stores malls restrictions number customers once. 75% school completely remote still.

 Guess what? numbers still skyrocketing. I'm proud Oregon Washington right now. Even California one lowest infestation rate. r/technicallythetruth allow us look trend instead absolute numbers. don’t care much pasta rather virus progressing community receding. Total number tests means little itself. Presidents busy watching MyPillow commercials worry God's die virus I’m wearing mask short term nasty economic impacts arent lifelong and

In America, poverty long-term situation. ruin credit almost impossible fix it. bad credit things 6+ years ago. credit score still recovered. can't even get approved car loan missed medical payments. understand poor people,

You understand anything poverty. another sheltered Redditor. picture alone cringe worthy. worse afford, get individual companies insanely profiteering things like diabetic medication (and changed better recently) people rationing medication people died. Oh man forgot war Christmas. Yup 40 mins boss work point out, number cases number deaths less 1%. flu, mentions never mention % survivors vs number cases. country? new daily cases went pretty low atm tho, assumed first wave finished Yeah, HELL going Belgium? water cannons streets spraying covid extract passers by? You’d keep vaccine though otherwise that’s better month. Dr Mantis Toboggan stop there? Clearly democracies better prepared for, better able combat, better able survive pandemics. Let's get distracted misleading statistics like ""case count"" ""death rate"" nothing propaganda authoritarian governments. Read contemplate lucky we're live  problem years. stupid people stick together defend opinions. “That’s opinion he’s entitled it” = stupid f#ing modern US spin subjective reality objective truth, power argument facts. think education system trying inclusive teaching it. “Accept people even different you.” - really back firing lot people opinions insane. ""science always right""

-the fucking president United States They're climate change

Lol think thats majority view Australians.  read plan? have. regards managing pandemic, difference things we're already plexiglass businesses. political fluff. This. Look current death rate. It’s lower early pandemic. partially (But reason) developed newer testing, better treatments, overall better understanding treat patients. science get better time. Today abnormalities brain scans, road possibly exactly causes prevent/treat it. Canada lagging overall pandemic timeline. every opportunity react gets worse, involves stricter guidelines rather later. Thank  liking poor

wtf? really ignorant? like mommy pay everything? Must nice. Yeah, like roof electricity food. Shit can't fucking working. world isn’t fair, adapt shut up.

The world fair. morbidly obese risk, problem. Adapt starving yourself, shut up.  mention reality taken table ago. *reported* Maybe global fatality rate COVID-19 similar fatality rate seasonal flu united states, median age US also higher world's ... man, morticians going filthy rich ~~when~~ ever blows over. 8.7 years subtract number people already infected. It’s amazing quick forget reason spread Australia Potato Dutton &amp; Gladys... way media acts, Dan Andrews allowed Ruby Princess dick NSW releasing passengers without quarantine. That’s call win. don’t know people hate blind submission authority? That’s bit shocking. guess must catholic something. works certain situations doesn’t mean it’s something desired emulate. understand it’s something turned turned off? doesn’t vanish pandemic over. 
The point need democracies work better beat virus. need leaders put away differences what’s right people. what’s political expedient moment. course easy control regard basic human rights. ""We make laws, enforce them"" still technically true. They're choosing enforce laws whole thing.. also lot people 100 years ago. i've read ifr 0.6-1.2%

interested (genuinely) know source(s) I’m nanny choice go work, family work taking seriously ALL. Entertaining, traveling, going out. 

I autoimmune disease. truly think I’m going die terrified. else going get this? Also, clothes 1st worst. 2nd best. Cloth cotton mean something like spandex/similar thin fabric? 

Do source beyond medical masks it’s pointless? People getting reinfected. Don’t talk immunity this. Bring old Tupperware squat backseat. Grandma taught one. 2020 going bang dadgum coronervirus ""I, Dr. Scott Atlas, promise taking natural, organic, herbal pill increase manhood substantially watch porn immediately consumption!"" 230K couldn’t even handle 1 infection let alone two. Biggest one day increase far! remember first news stories it. Late November, early December. could see writing wall. Halloween cancelled america??

That fucked. guys fucked. now, day might get another cluster, lets come across cocky, unseemly. 

Whole damn northern world's gonna bad winter, could us shitty leadership fewer natural advantages. think anybody leash Trump paying attention slightest. conspiracy. There's underneath crap going here. course Putin role, see right get. 

You think Republicans happy? Hell no. anyone ever worked stuck around? Nope. There's man behind scenes. listens person little bit flushes toilet. saw 101,000. Largely rural, independent-minded, since hit virus early everyone pretty much scoffed it. one wearing masks distancing, spreading. since already chose ""it's big deal"" side they've slow take recommended measures slow spread, spreading like wildfire. I’m astounded daily level ignorance gullibility sub, it’s almost fascinating  comment section terrible thought would be. wear surgical masks respect essential workers forced wear order get paycheck. reality - people wearing anything made cloth wearing mask, amounts vast majority population. give fuck political party is, person virtue signaling anti-maskers wear cloth, total hypocrite. us taking seriously. we're disgusted don't. Totally agree - it’s scary see easily spread. 10 crappy days, I’m feeling much better thankfully! last region experience first wave. new them

Facts reality new. apply little bubble. average vitamin supplement runs around nickel per pill. 

Can't get much cheaper that. LETS GO USA IT!!!! liking poor people dying. 

Has still sunk health isn’t issue self-obsessed child, it’s people might die interactions business unfortunately doesn’t need exist.

Do think horse stable workers happy Model T? Blockbuster Netflix?

If business shuttered, isn’t essential, saying doesn’t suck, mean business needed society continue.

The world isn’t fair, adapt shut up. clue, know Fauchi said still first wave week ago. Teeny tiny one: Melb Australia mega-lockdown tamp outbreak, modelling hit anticipated figure (5 cases/ 14 day rolling average) exactly day. Yeah, shocked us too. Science works. Brought Donny Corona, superspreader chief. Even risk higher age group, necessarily death sentence anyone. Good luck grandma send positive energy way!  Seconded Thanks actually saying this, it’s click bait article based nothing Username checks states said door knock Halloween? Seems like huge way strangers bring doorstep. Even Biden wins, Trump president late January. seems unlikely real policy changes time. point reach critical level? needs happen people take seriously? Another 2 months record numbers like 99.9% everyone worrying really start worrying 😂 fucking morons. funny I'm beat sissies asses keep refusing get board pandemic.  Yea, mean sound like every person got sick, lot them. real scariest part virus catch even take every precaution. know why. Maybe reduced pollution due less commuting companies going permanently remote? get flu shot!!! **do want** catch respiratory virus leave weakened covid. Younger people typically less vulnerable means immune Covid young people die get seriously sick.

The whole statement young people hardly affected - really ok older vunerable people like diabetics ill die?

Your life isnt ruined, short term nasty economic impacts arent lifelong nasty impacts impact dying would have, eh? Even lose everything people lose everything rebuild, happens refugees time.

 virus left unchecked, overwhelm hospitals getting higher risk dying people spreading willy nilly. Death rates specific availability quality healthcare well demographics.

I agree regards treatment poor people US, really need financial support whilst happening right able go spread virus. understand poor people, especially working poor choice work thats awful.

The US working culture (among things) fundamentally broken symptom that. Australia (and certainly didnt get everything perfect long shot) support people lost jobs due covid - sort practise US could afford, isnt really widespread level.

Its sad disheartening everyone.  unable sleep night, thinking thousands die virus due incompetent leadership. people charge listen scientists lot stupid people think ""not bad seems"". Every day see people wearing masks, people still shake hands... knew people dumb, epidemic really proves it. Everything going get even worse holidays people come together even usual. Schools still closed. Hospitals still full. European countries seem going herd immunity would mean lot people die, psychopatic. lost hope humanity, let come giant meteor end us all. Thankfully even fed gov sucks distribution chain hospitals/medical professionals care. 100K Cases Any% World Record! USA!! USA!! USA!!  frank, simply understand obsession hating 'authoritarianism'. control pandemic, NEED authoritarianism. like authoritarianism normal times. normal times. prospect getting back normal without authoritarian first. like arguing censorship middle World War. make sense. Since people right thing, need strong government force people behave. collective good trump individualism pandemic over. Hopefully much longer.. Australia too. state Western Australia community cases virus since April.

July 24, Victoria (where Melbourne is) 532 new cases virus, even France's 514. Today, ~~1 new case~~, [zero new controlled, democracies too.

Where suspect we'll see controlled nations highly divided themselves, desire/attempt eradicate/contain. virus contain itself.  Lol aren't. Omg bitter. Everyone bigot atheists. Honestly Jesus Allah lol
For record similarities that's fine. friend always discuss similarities differences, definitely interchangeable. saying disrespectful communities. Woohoo? wear mask

so scary ... halloween ones pulling strings ones headlines, that's problem. mean, Putin kind headlines, nearly much ought be... possible get vitamin d, zinc, vitamin c. slightly helps. got mine Amazon We’re number 1!!!! We’re number 1!!! really sad. clarify statement later comment. fake statistic fact it’s one, it’s used way falsifies actually is. 

Appreciate work charts. Wish people would see understand them. probably options. top head, rather going Democratic governors lock claiming doctors lying COVID deaths could, dunno, opposite? USA USA NUMBER ONE USA Actually, yes. Turn fox news bit grandma Orange sus faking task force. fact leadership isn’t even trying though.... that’s gets me. People people. It’s problem us people “believing” wearing masks. US maybe Brazil leadership doesn’t even try places. Like state. single mask mandate anywhere. got there, lot beaches.  Yeah. said gonna take 15 cases make zero, holy hell deliver, get zero cases, owned libs got one, SIX WHOLE ZEROES cases. could gotten one zero, GOD BLESS MURICA ^(/s)  Check friend! Yeah certainly did. knew exactly hit weaknesses.  can't get protest mind boggling willfully ignorant people are. would anyone want kind people running country. would think 90% Americans would want people watching happening. don't. race actually pretty close. That's depressing part. Trump problem. symptom.  get infected once. Fuck you. like kids could scenario. Also, current world catastrophy enough reason kids. 

You speaking another. Shut fuck go pop goblins keep yourself. Wrong place, wrong time, dumb fuck topic. 

I hope choke water today. simple: politicians make claims without evidence becomes politicized. 

This Trump administration senators GOP talk bullshits never take responsibilities. number expected America things ""perfectly"", opposed 2 million+ like Dr. Fauci Dr. Birx said would happen didn't. 

I understand fascination Trump hate. I'm saying he's perfect, people going die regardless charge White House. That's fact need wake accept. sooner do, sooner might come realize blaming root cause outbreak branch it. Back March, nearly 3 hour long argument German masks good hygeine meant virtually need much shut virus closing borders, argument lockdown thing works. 7 months later, Germany jumping mask train going multiple soft lockdowns, I'm feeling Schadenfreude Germany breaking infection records, live, life going virtually always had, except everyone wearing masks, strict lockdown ever implemented, minimal inconvenience daily life. Feels really bloody good man. 3% country covid now, including half dumbass conservative side family wear masks political reasons You’re great, sweetie. Personally, prefer Argentinian Antibodies one immune system mechanism. 

C19 triggers tcell/bcell immune response well. even reinfections widespread predicted, vast majority asymptomatic mild.

Human Coronaviruses also one many obtain affinity maturation to, infection two likely unable infected anymore. OC43 HKU1, two mild Coronaviruses cause colds studied one infection antibodies wane around half people reinfected exposed. third time 10% were. Coronaviruses mild ones weaker immune response. 

Despite news antibodies fading (which totally normal RNA virus), longest term studies have, majority people still going strong antibodies left. 

In likelihood sterilizing immunity lasts somewhere 6-24 months like viruses family, build immune responses ways. 

Its really never ending thing people get severe infections every year. idea anyone got idea. widespread reinfections. vast majority ones found asymptomatic mild. 

After people acquired immunity infection vaccination immune suppressed endemic disease still circulates, causes bad colds similar. That's likely headed. Tired winning much*

Fixed ya. Selling china russia. real today best it'll awhile. thought yesterday worst, today happened. really second time cases going July. limited indoor dining that's it. Gyms still open Broward county movie theaters open. 

Masks probably biggest effect cases everywhere trend going down, even areas lockdowns implemented. rang? China best = communism Today also busiest bar since St. Patrick's Day. People given up. might remind president power lock republic. seem taken wrong turn, ended dodgy end street. Yikes New deaths: 933

is US going full natural selection? Im genuinely terrified learned anything going cause third wave. I'm staying home moment people stop fucking nuts. Bro check Instagram, everything fine!!

/s change two weeks later? virus sleep inside hosts without symptoms like flu. That's solution achieve heard immunity controlled exposure virus groups 65% need medical assistance. even takes two weeks see diagnosed infections result deaths. 100k new cases means around 1700 deaths/day two weeks. That's even concern me. lot friends fucking orange county huge Halloween rager. I'm sure that's gonna happen everywhere. 

I want live planet anymore Androids. Fuck Ladies gentlemen present astounding country America, led people hundred fifty years behind times. Aside reports China locking residents Wuhan, I'm really sure construes authoritarianism measures used cities like Beijing Shanghai. intents purposes, way outbreak handled regions something countries emulated. Ferengi becomes Chief Accountant progressive Klingon government, decided try ""flexible"" multiple prompts recommendations Federation ""diversity""

Sounds right metaphor  get information relentless? even possible hit 100k _new_ cases day ? Even consider 50% positive rate means 200k people getting tested daily can't nice things second link provided"" ""Nationally, overall percentage respiratory specimens testing positive SARS-CoV-2, virus causing COVID-19, i**ncreased 6.6% week 42 7.1%** week 43.

Also note 10/24/2020.

Deaths trailing indicator reflecting infection situation 5-6 weeks ago.

But right. clue can't read chart either. blue line belongs left axis! Crazy can't get test easily. I'm MI several locations around drive thru testing. symptoms needed get tested. register online show up. I've gotten test every week last month people I've come contact keep testing positive. Luckily gotten yet. Stay safe! I've talked people happy city/state mandating masks cause that's ""A disturbing amount government control"". Like wtf. fucking mask, mild inconvenience yet helps save lives. 

No one takes umbridge speed limits roads that's government essentially mandating behave common good. narrow minded childishness appalling. many 

I'd rather (1) \*live\* (2) west

Pick 1. instead congregate closely together poorly ventilated homes. Sometimes even travel across country so.....Thanksgiving (USA), Christmas, New Year's etc. point despite trying get people favorably view him, resistance common sense measures fact protocols aren’t obviously good enough, point likely case wasn’t take context he’s intentional,y misleading uninformed moron.

Your state ok atm doesn’t undo  fair, voters would kidnap family gunpoint tried right thing. must like republican governor... messed up. Trump: ""We're rounding turn!""

[The recommendations January developed studying epidemic unfolded China, many country actually adopted 9 months later? Oh that's right, none.

Let's honest, what's complaint? China given couple weeks prepare, would wasted behaving exactly way behaving now, China locked Wuhan exactly way earlier, call horrible draconian human rights violation refuse even contemplate control spread country? Chinese people moral obligation protect infectious disease think constitutional right spread many people possible?  EU's biggest problem basically allowed free travel within region restrictions. leaders least tried somewhat listening scientists.

America's failed response egregious fueled leadership refuses take responsibility, lead example constantly denigrated health experts measures recommended them.  Hunter running president. Bush built cages. Even get long term health complications likely expect lower life expectancy economic consequences. like 3 every 10,000 Americans so? idiots listen musicians anything music. ಠ_ಠ well talking one winter different time frames...we hope get control mid 2021 means probably dont chance vaccines effective method... really best simple explanation seen far. Especially living small town seeing days zero cases not, literally looks like virus exist here. kids want take care old kids. I'm convinced half adults country vehemently argue wrong even try explain them. non Exactly. one tiger, implications long-term COVID strategy. there's gonna thousands perpetual reservoirs different wild domestic animal species, need adjust expectations plan accordingly. 

The flu also infect lot different animals, though obviously biology genetics different due shuffle-able genome error-prone polymerase. years decades line get another, virulent zoonotic strain bounces back us one animal reservoirs? CDC huge disclaimers data says take 8 weekes true numbers fully accounted for. sermon delivered church wide group hug. We're number one! Imagine retarded thing possible. Ring wingers think that's good idea. Sounds like burning man less sex drugs know big numbers, fellow redditor solid I'm pretty drunk..... fuck math sure....



My province 4.37 million people 622 cases today, per capita stack vs 97,000 cases total population America? Foxnews watched TV news outlet far. damn media reporting news stop reporting it, go away. fucking terrifying. 

If regularly add 100k day, month that's 3 million new cases. Nearly 10% country's population month.

I knew things going get worse getting better. hoped bad. said shit may."" Look, 200 deaths, 90% high! "" people saying convince right somehow. Deaths lag. Put helmets Major Tom. It’s finished wall Mexico border. turning corner. Cause we’ve going circles months now. Oh dang, we'd better cancel voting. Poor Democrats. 2,400 deaths. Almost repeat 9/11 every day effects administration felt century. broke trust many allies cozied dictators. Dismantled many programs helpful poor. He's probably President highest wealth inequality increase. Europe lost cause point... compare U.S Belgium Switzerland, steady rise cases 6+ months

Again, they're conglomeration several states, controls handle covid separately. live NY example. huge wave beginning. petered extremely new cases (and getting new wave(s) parts again). state waves different times handling differently course always high rates. totally compare US Belgium. Belgium 400k cases US 9 million, 23 times roughly. population 33 times size percentage population wise they're even worse us (and good). Bet family Tennessee well. live middle nowhere smokies drink moonshine day. reason there's low flu numbers southern hemisphere. Restrictions/masking/distancing effective flu well flu less contagious. Also, beginning flu season here. see much increase even normal year. Nah, China, Korea, Vietnam Japan chilling. horror show selective schedule mostly western exclusive. It’s fine McDonald Trump Jr. said essentially done with. it’s good seeing post totally agree you. Remember everyone saying get mass testing tracing reopen could deal spikes? infection rate doubled 1 2% (while states 25-50%) told stupid. associated US seen one country people wouldn’t trashing us 2% infection rate.  new high score /s past point return? Like seems like many cases per day really cliff felt yet. wonder many families going missing people Christmas/Hanukkah/Kwanzaa. Conveniently right election. Trump give less shit either way. Either loses lame duck President wins gets confirmation perceived majority care. mean- Yeah. 

For old person, like 3 seconds x amount trick treaters. busy neighborhood add lot time exposed USA USA USA. number one. Suck world. guess we're going get now? Nah he’s concerned shorting market idiot supporters dying money? america worst everything. say otherwise website. Trump fucking obsessed keeping economy going. Yeah, Trump! got good GDP, people dying left right centre! point driving economy nobody drive it. Still less european countries lol Halloween election day coming week Right. I’d wager positivity rate really isn’t good way estimate severity situation Mexico. tests per million 18,284. It’s indicative Czech Republic tests per million 205,656. reference, US 427,189. you’re testing general population people symptoms, useful percent positivity becomes determining severe situation is. genuinely feel sorry you. Get (safely) really bad media portrays Hi Arcadia Lite! Virtual hugs candy kiddo! Thank safe. agree-I’m glad ASU renters nextdoor us finally moved recently, maddening listen almost weekly parties. I’m sure still them. least don’t witness selfishness. Eradicate? No. Get us back manageable state go there? Fuck yes. much winning! Bad news without hospital intervention death rate jumps 5-10%. hospitals can't handle load shit gets really fucked. think read somewhere white house cut CDC covid case numbers sent directly administration? stats given white house now? remembering right. People ""worry"" killing people sociopaths. 

I know cult, matters lot never contradict Trump, continue sociopath. 

200,000 dead, bad, political goal. 

Hey, word that, someone thinks human lives good trade ideological goal? 

You've got moral compass terrorist, least something believed con-man's ego. Enjoy CO(vi)D Murdoch infested* except, right first time, would less ""pandemic fatigue"".

But almost every country fucked point. blaming China outbreak, everyone dropped ball. Explain there’s barely flu numbers year mean, Cascadia fault would cause massive tsunami too, would hit whole west coast issue way Japan. least Yellowstone, ready evacuate whole continent, activity starts, knows dealing current catastrophes Motherfuckers can’t wear mask 10 min shop grocery store want lockdown nation. 


It’s right move wrong audience Try single parent two young kids school home, unemployment system paid 28 weeks mass overseas fraud, everyone guilty see damn penny. really everybody. hear occasional non-believer. see randoms without masks see people wearing wrong.

Many ppl take seriously plenty ppl don't. hear better allot country though. Indica, da couch. Ignore life. Fra kly lived US would plan. Prep 6 month lockdown, get highhhh. Fuck it. oh... hooray... True true. true. 

I’m taking seriously, doesn’t help spread fear necessary.

For example, someone commented thread don’t think vaccines available 2025 rate. That’s obviously true (unless vaccines insane surprise makes useless)  would matter, country whole heading entirely wrong direction...? “Let man job” - mom No, Covid PCR positives pick flu. Science! I'm sure article shared disagreeing anything doc said humidity? said virus still contagious high humidity, also seemed confirm worse low humidity. 

Either way, here's i've got: 

[Here's conducted **autumn season** Australia (Autumn March-May Southern Hemisphere)

**Summary**

a consistent negative relationship found relative humidity cases. Overall, decrease relative humidity 1% associated increase cases 7–8%. Overall, found relationship cases temperature, rainfall wind speed. Information generated study confirms humidity driver SARS‐CoV‐2 transmission.

\[referring study 2010\] Temperature relative humidity affect coronavirus transmission, virus survival (at lower temperatures coronaviruses survive longer) length time infectious respiratory matter stays suspended air (at lower humidity droplets stay suspended longer).

**Additional Info**

\[[Journal Virology Flu seasonality\] Relative humidity change size composition virus-carrying respiratory droplets. lower relative humidity, salts respiratory droplet may crystallize leading lower salt concentrations better virus survival. Less water vapor air also result evaporation water respiratory droplets, leading smaller respiratory droplet size. Smaller droplets may travel hang air longer. droplets may higher concentrations live virus well.

[As Short Communication *International Journal Infectious Diseases* virus first gets respiratory tract, worse infection may end being. Therefore, respiratory droplets tend higher amounts active virus temperature humidity drop, resulting infections could dangerous.

A 1% decrease relative humidity predicted increase cases 7–8%, pronounced effect relative humidity &lt;75–79%. almost PHUs negative relationship relative humidity cases found.

**Lastly**

Here's [Heatmap average humidity United . El Paso tip furthest left corner Texas. They've one hardest hit cities US summer strict lockdowns multiple times. Thought interesting. shut fuck cunt, people obviously effected differently situations boat guy replied response fucking disgusting. argument: ""you plenty years left"" bollocks time fun young, taken away. Ah, shit. That's good. Alice B Toklas says high Prepare see huge spike Halloween! I'm very, surprised low numbers generalized obviously differs town town. hardest hit areas first wave mixed second wave, relatively high cases now, low. hardest hit areas first wave generally lower income high people per household. risk factors still likely offsetting benefits partial herd immunity. 
I’m sure disagree tbh. think infected early longer immunity? WI legislature even convened since like April. APRIL. supreme court even overturned Evers's mask mandate assumption GOP would back plan, NOTHING. Recently Evers tried mask mandate GOP stayed silent, still, dear fucking god hate here. 

I've trapped inside small upper apartment 3 year old since March. Thanks fucking idiots refuse give right lick crowded bars, I'm fucking HELL. shit Sherlock Well, there's cure so... Mate I've watching news weeks im wondering US turn unto full blown World War Z/ covid everywhere. know answer coming soon sadly. denying reality here? single statement made untrue challenge prove otherwise. I’m sorry realization may good righteous person think hard swallow, facts are.

You keep saying 200,000. mostly elderly people multiple illnesses would’ve dead COVID weren’t around. Again, true statement don’t like it, maybe bias issue. Well that's concerning play devil’s advocate, Charlie Watts Topper Headon two favorite drummers heroin loaded. ;) much know US government screwed pooch, understand people pissed fellow Americans. People know masks help, bunch people refuse wear them. also know gatherings people dangerous, people intent partying. Same. neighbor large sign saying 'we handing candy Halloween, please come door'. Motherfuckers better wearing mask using one long claws reach shelves plastic robot claws. dumb fucks let puppy fostered die parvo refused take back shelter vet get treated. Yeah, 7% abysmal. still bad bad Europe right now. Yes. ticks hear people complain can't go fucking bar get drunk COVID. inconvenience. Sorry, could lifelong debilitated COVID. Sorry can't get high buddies Friday night get drunk grind local whore COVID. There's much significant issues petty concerns inconvenience. tag post folks interested understanding herd immunity bit better; today listened medical history podcast ""Sawbones"" episode it. Basically doctor husband talking concept herd immunity applies humans term used medically vaccine available. podcast, guess mind form. I'm sure Wikipedia succinct answer looking one. Nebraska reported given period, apparently sufficient slightest eradicate virus 101k they’re looping flu cases whatever else Time cut Foxnews El Paso. actually Wuhan early January couple thousand end month, tanks street. 

The level responded obviously can't happen North America, Christ truly deadly pandemic ever hits, y'all fucked America us Canada far behind. birth right freedoms gone heads far many us think individuality important thing. live hotspot partner lucky enough companies switched WFH least rest 2020. one couple friends see also heavily distancing, hanging homes only. families either working high traffic roles like grocery stores, working hospitals literally treating covid patients, distancing high risk demographics. know fact single person fallen ill died COVID partner. say same? WORST PRESIDENT EVER........ Unlikely unbelievable. fatass americans arms haircut eating inside chickfila. China probably killed people stay home seriously insane. poll local Nextdoor month ago 40% respondents hell-bent trick treating kids handing candy normal effing year. pointed CDC health officials strongly urge everyone this, informed people free make decisions based research. Also, telling putting others risks hospitalization and/or death, bullying them. 

My kids getting really cool assortment Halloween games, activities, movies Mom's place tomorrow night. I'm looking forward spike COVID cases right Thanksgiving, followed morons *have* normal, traditional Thanksgiving friends family, followed damn thing Christmas. Alright fuck old people people conditions then. keep hearing people spout ""oh young healthy people fine""......ok, everyone else? Jeez except mushroomed thats 80% diet Yeah Bay Area still pretty damn good comparatively last several months. I’m glad least *some* parts country well. Keep up! Remember people saying 100k cases *total* doom gloom? comment dumbest thing you’ve read sub? Man really hang head shame. get trace numbers connected Trump rallies? increased wet dry directions; effect may depend substantially temperature. Dry air winter may problem places, fixing would actually mean balancing humidity (dehumidifier needed) reach target goal right safest point. point seems apparent there’s way it’s gonna controlled people seem think. think we’ve reached point limited options. gotta protect vulnerable, distance wear masks let run course. don’t see vaccine coming save us brutal winter It’s yet. Atlas shrugged I'm high risk group, still want A. want deal ill B. want end lasting health effects. death rate reason someone might want stay away thing. Attitudes like (""you've got low chance dying need worry it"") still spreading.

And person responded they're reason - either health issues, someone health issues worry about, they're dealing anxiety. anxiety disorder blame anyone wanting hermit watch world burn right now.  WE’RE NUMBER 1! ALWAYS WINNING! Almost 100K Daily Cases. Congratulations Trump Administration beating virus. wouldn’t include South Korea never truly locked like countries. Nah Trumps great love honesty, better vast majority. Everything different level risk. long attending something hundreds people, well mind. Next stop, 1 million cases week! wait guys makes total sense. I’ve never France Europe matter. America really country exists? Yes.  English teacher living China give us real inside scoop? bad lockdown really? still welded apartment? still testing TCM you? world meters ‘us reports’ different? collecting data?  scared shit me. talking cube farm remember turning coworker asking could imagine would happen made here, there’s way decentralized systems could muster kind containment response, even actually tried to. Lol, dedicate Trump vote today you. rally lit too. say like always case regardless Note: added name enough characters post video. method meeting character requirements approved initial removal editing title twice before. 

I add something video won’t post all. Thanks :) hand, death rates accurate testing rates. Plenty people may never get tested never show symptoms, people dying always tested. 

Not trying dismiss severity this; trying understand data. They’ve minority now, they’re good taking power despite numbers disadvantage. gotta protect vulnerable, distance wear masks let run course.

This intentional crime leaders tried executed treason, among 10 things.  depends country who's getting infected. IFR Ireland first wave was, apparently 2%, hit care homes. July, 1.7% population caught virus, 83,300. 1,700 died.

The UK estimated IFR first wave 1.4% bit 0.68% last weeks. 

Then again, lower numbers depend functional hospitals getting care homes again. Well mean... competition bottom, it? guys awhile? Good job, we've really outdone Herd immunity applicable term here. time would take (without causing absolute mass deaths collapsed health care system) would long, long enough virus successfully evade immunity via mutation, simply people's bodies losing immunity time.

This college pathology 101. 

Rapid widespread vaccine deployment, super aggressive pathogens (kill hosts fast) way reach herd immunity. much US government ( also Governments) failed miserably COVID large portion blame put people. need Government force wear mask. shear ignorance lack education empathy many people shockingly high.

We live generation entire human races collective knowledge accessable palm hand still stupid people want wear mask save life's inconvenient. expect happen instead? so... 5 days then? Looks like looting protesting best ideas Bro number daily cases literally highest ever America. LITERALLY never worse Hard??
no kids arent dumb
just say dont want make kids die covid(yes, use word die) really. already knew covid could infect tigers cats general. far first time. 100%. bunch people going really disappointed find President able micromanage country 320 million. Oregon well. Cascadia would probably lowest true. However, 1.5 million confirmed cases last week beyond horrific... Rage inducing understatement.  viruses work? leaves weakened? thought resistance Another record day? fatalistic standpoint; begins fun part. system breaks watch covitards start complaining government anything prevent desaster, MARK WORDS. Yay world record! /s possibility, country pussys Wait, still room? I'm sorry like Ivanka said, find something new. probably tell France 514 cases today? Seems like need 4 week lockdown all! Allons-y! White House say virus already defeated? confused... Seriously. It’s actually little scary. I’m assuming conspirac stuff going go full Alex Jones restrictions mind? Reminds Bush Jr. ""mission accomplished"" banner/celebration real shit started.

No blame, know definitely spreads air, almost always, rarely fomites. Even dumbest anti-masker Idaho blames COVID-like disease knows that. Even one developed, take quite bit time manufacture large amounts doses distribute everyone.

Pretty sure administration going get first. I. seems like leaders downplay politicize furthers risk gives people excuses. fear already late.

Didn't bunch scientists say definitively late? Like change *could have* made never *was actually done* got pinch emergency measures could salvage things ignored too, ""humans face die-off watch happen.""

Or least, that's *close* things I've read /r/askscience last 5 years. Maybe memory blown proportion? dunno, seems like things already bad, seem like much stretch get worse. want catch respiratory virus leave weakened covid.

And vice versa, considering bad flu be. I'm WI, NY.

Absolute figures mean little, need look trend positivity make judgment makes think halfway current wave? look like slowing all. Whats likely - literally every government policy strategy North America, Europe South America failed control controllable pandemic variables play novel virus yet fully understand? Cause Donald J Trump president United States baby called democracy baby look wooo! They’ve held onto things 4, 8, 12 years believing true. can’t admit wrong. point feels almost inevitable I'm going catch it. I'm stuck living people care. Oh well, guess deserve making better choices life. what? matters death. Oi cunt second lockdown sucked. people going pretend like lose sensibility. Would fucking surprised numbers go months. huge chunk Americans, majority, deserve him. loud, awful smaller chunk makes us look terrible. guys brave criticism. constructive ideas could executed federal level, bunch pissing moaning everyone smart you. Protests fine fuck everyone else locking home right? didn’t realize many experts Reddit simultaneously combat virus cause problems. Try perspective once. track elimination. Another day new cases today sure you’re really stupid neurological addiction sardines. recommended daily intake incorrectly calculated far low. feel bad?? Cause I’m living life staying hidden house? Yes great example Democrats making political instead science. didn’t ask example though. be? Arent wearing masks? Hiw isnthe death rate trending? dont personally care much cases. cough fever whatever people dying mass much concerning me. know what’s funny see trumpets super spreader rally weeks apart growing Covid cases. TREATMENT ANYONE WILLINGLY SAT EVENTS. catch covid tell it’s fake. Winning! Go trump! see vir I'm going say also help stage infection immune system damage rather virus.

Monoclonal antibodies antivirals effective early infection. late stage severe cases need treatments control immune response inflammation. don’t think say everyone says people deserve it. admit actively fighting refusing basic health measures, threatening health officials government officials, gets easier say made bed. absolve people willful ignorance long. admit it, though, sharply reducing birth rate *could* lead less people competing resources biosphere cooks. wouldn’t same?

The necktie cause strangulation. Please pray church. take bad, feel bad. We're already 1000 deaths per day. Deaths lag behind cases too, we'll see wayyyyyy 970 deaths day.  went ER high temperature? going youre trouble breathing. Shhhh don’t listen facts website. NYC 50%+ while. order get past first wave need significant drop new cases, achieved via lockdowns. Seeing entire never fully went lockdown, numbers kept rising, still first wave. Trump friend Brazil intent maintaining leads.

And least parts developing world track getting worse. Sorry getting downvoted simple truth. Daily case count mean anything without similar comparison deaths. Even taking account lag covid-related deaths vs. diagnosis, pattern clear.

The IFR Table 1. last two months, covid-related deaths decline, even Deaths Causes remains relatively constant. Typo 😅 Lockdowns likely. one, useful anymore. rather, useful, attack wrong activities regards transmission. used think virus easily spread near people brief amounts time, know primarily aerosol-driven low-ventilation indoor social events spreading it. Churches, bars, parties, hang outs, restaurants etc. Outdoor transmission nearly unheard virus. lockdown, keeps people going outside... best solution anymore. mean, still poor choice costume... Czech republic second cases per 1M, right Belgium. now. No. NASCAR two races away running entire Cup Series season. 36 races. vaccine today, still achieve widespread distribution winter over. might able protect exposed vulnerable timeframe, we're lucky. I'm expecting Thanksgiving, Christmas, new years follow along. Thanks comment, followed example learnt something new today! Well, normally there's nearly many people need ICU. top critical covid cases, stuff puts people ICU. may anything beneficial, atleast it’s Trump where’s he’s clawing shit covered hands open wound glee.  RemindMe! 8 weeks

RemindMe! 8 weeks Check month. guarantee ""stabilizing"" then. Hey, think we're winning!  Yeah scientists typically families. Sooo hearing? USA USA USA number 1 number 1... 

If Florida country would 4th world cases. Cats &amp; dogs, living together...total chaos I've heard quite people near say covid going disappear right election over. Like, normally reasonably intelligent competent people. I'm curious hear say doesn't. self reflect? learn something?

We'll find soon. could believe that. really hurts (Czech living TX). nervous nation-wide Covid testing Slovakia. hope numbers crazy high. Czech republic needs too. sister took two kids trunk treat, went directly 66 year old mother's house. She'll probably go 75 yo 82 yo grandparents well.

She'll likely get someone sick killed. already.

And I'm damned say word, damned sweatin' there's vaccine. Hopefully family take it. Lord knows propaganda they're consuming. Everyone working remotely needs *encouraged* we're significantly lower emissions significant way. Ahem, real number actually 101,000 cases. stimulate immune system thought. combination monoclonal antibodies? adding (very specific) antibodies. wonder one cross reactive human tissues causes ADE. best guess though actually due findings antibodies diddly-squat stage infection. mean? always thought probably absolute common way spread. thought otherwise? scientists.... 🤷‍♀️ Yes. says deaths slowly increasing past two weeks, rate much higher early July, like said. Smart. look per capita stats, many US states broken record months ago. Looking smaller places per capita misleading. Also looking stats day day basis misleading well. would also accurate compare bigger region big country, that’ll provide closer like like comparison. compare smaller country stats may well compare smaller regions like US states like New York stats compared say Belgium there’s smaller populations means likely see higher rate deaths regions. Comparing smaller nations big population place purely designed push certain narrative. claim US whole Europe whole better smaller place haven’t seen ~1700 deaths per million population like New York example.  money still go back economy. boardgame spending gone way since COVID-19 sad embarrassing. Oh man, that's lot rich doctors..... /s Well leader USA openly said doesn’t believe science, us Yankees fucked. take pill buttered vegetables something, absolute donut Victoria Australia... 0 new cases today... wooo. Apropos nothing, one dozens relatives UK Germany US Sri Lanka Australia New Zealand caught back March 2020 thereabouts Switzerland British tourist ski trip. Apparently ski resorts sometimes particularly bad spreading Covid-19. like America missed chance breaking records Olympics year they're dedicated breaking record can. Positivity rate high compared EU countries least Adelaide. It’s pretty damn terrifying you’re risk rate starting climb around you. ""Fauci warned us pleaded country get daily cases 10,000 hit fall/winter. ""

I never understood logic. virus incredibly high natural transmission rate, meaning 'getting low point' doesnt mean much terms preparation. current surges europe show insanely low point, surge [unimaginably high-highs span handful 

There going kind situation get virus level worry it. maintain mitigation. 'goal' figure aim everything fine loosen restrictions. find middle ground restrictions, harmful peoples lives keeps virus manageable level, *stay way* get vaccine. happening here, amazing competent government gets Yep. there's anything horrible downside, combo increased deaths plus COVID possibly making some/many survivors sterile might slow population growth enough *don't* ultimately hit 10 billion climate apocalypse. Canada terribly mishandled covid. play dirt. get dirty. I'm sorry England screwed up. can't true.  Numerous posters sub claimed Sweden done fantastic job possibly hit another wave.

Is possible Reddit posters simply clue they're talking about? I'm shocked. ""Waves"" references pandemic controlled community spread (spread large community rather individual patients slip cracks) mitigated zero low levels. 

The second ""wave"" resurgence virus already brought heel. Maybe there's lapse public health measures, mutated, conditions like seasons change allow greater spread. 

Us still stuck 1st wave bad means there's virus spreading population. active caseload levels instead goes down, there's virus circating population spike cases. leads disastrous outcomes like now, virus widespread many measures we'd ordinarily use become less effective (like hospital treatment) effective (like contact tracing expanded testing). 

I doctor, scientists, epidemiologist, explanations I've heard public radio. USA, link need stay informed total numbers related Covid cases / Covid deaths Europe fucked up. Spoken like true smooth brain. It’ll nice record mouthbreathers crisis. Kids read comment someday ask people could sooooo stupid.

The teacher comfort say, “Sally, weren’t dumb, ones really went it!” I'll trust MIT shown many studies cloth masks good job preventing outward infection important thing. Even good n95 mask mean still job. spread disinformation. Yeah, like would people blame guy spent whole crisis downplaying danger, hosting superspreader rallies telling followers ignore CDC WHO? Leave Trump alone 😢 U.S.A! U.S.A! #1 baby! governor thinks Covid-19 regulations like masks social distancing enforced ~~people smart enough make right decision~~ lack courage necessary confront large portions population.

Enforcing mask laws country would lead much violence, many police interactions. would erode police's support one section public still thinks good guys. simply refuse it. government official going order look incompetent people refuse job. feel like US like Lt. Dan shrimping boat right now. something, businesses reminded profits important. Theres lot truth would think. Like three comments vaccine, rest not. note quite saying they'll wait they're vaccinated.

Obviously America best COVID candor, accountability, objectivity, accuracy. Also biggest beautiful COVID testing president offered virus study effects pure Anglo-Saxon ubermensch. better layer KN95 mask cloth mask together wear KN95? Source? Judging comment, clue statistics work. new cases fake statistic overall number cases going despite record number people testing positive now?? Here’s actually statistics disprove bullshit. gotta fake news right? President said pandemic over. Pretty soon they'll making us wear seatbelts! slippery slope! going ask shoe store security guards, outcome indicates why, guess. much children getting it, spread to. catch give parents, teachers, school staff. depends hellbent Republicans keeping things open matter bad gets. example, Ron DeSantis Florida seems pretty intent running things ground. turns really made Chinese lab, hell pay. *points username* *Marks BINGO card* We're almost 500, average interval 74 days. frankly happening quicker expected, 500 alarmingly high number early overall event. applaud skepticism optimism, get wrong! see time reinfections massive complicating factor. surprising either! Although many surprising, especially may struggled grasp nuance carefully worded public health communications. ""Promised made, promised kept..."" US, states lower infections(northeast) schools stay virtual teacher unions refusing go in. 

The idea schools can't spread stupid. Israel came said last wave due schools. extremely old infirm judged warrant hospital care. one denied seen. Families consulted others made decision. read articles posted elsewhere. 

We aren’t talking hint old age comorbidities don’t think said that. wasn’t clear apologize. dont think thats getting either initial viral load effect outcome afaik. talked quite bit subs back Jan... US going knees soon. That’s attacks take place, we’re starting see happen.

Fastest way take us (besides EMP) cripple healthcare systems pandemic hitting exponential growth. know it. know it. Let’s hope admins shit together ward attacks. Well clearly insult made attempts address lack actual sources support claim instead got ""offended"" like conspiracy nutter. sympathies parents whoever poor fortune interacting real life. realize children live parents grandparents infect them? realize parents work, shop, etc? sure schools taking appropriate measures Johnson vaccine

we've already hit 1000 deaths day flu season begun. thankful live Oregon voting mail. think placing eggs wrong basket expecting compassion results UK. say Brit. 

Look France - proper lockdown hopefully get results soon. cases much higher US per population too. 

I hope things get better across pond. Keep safe people save money they’re working get fired want quit, can. 

The majority Americans live paycheck-to-paycheck. you’re stupid save money?

Do think majority Americans stupid? like underpaid overworked. cost living going salaries. 

No one afford work months. Unless part 1%. it’s Halloween weekend. means everyone school going parties weekend, test numbers already high. Lovely. take appropriate measures definitely far many list goes on, dude. Schools spreading virus, country's cases rise. *Shockingly*. K bub Yes, Netherlands - OP numbers familiar.

People take seriously wear masks here.

Not sure Belgium twice raw numbers country 2/3 population... check Slovenian PM Janez Jansa - fucking twitts randomly. Last time Sunday 21h - banned leaving municipalities (we 200 2 mil people). talks police curfew 22:30 - 5:00... he'll twit Oh btw, 21:00 - 6:00 on. 24 - 48 hours measures place.

This banned, not, exception. Schools on, schools off, can't, can, can't again... fucking clusterfuck.

Waiting he'll install snapchat tik tok. stupid call atheist... jesus god. Remember said millennials ones protect rest us because, ""you're young it""? 

I done ass day March course may does, sacrifice willing nake retarded give fuck. Home Depot Ohio demo set store quick guide make supplies needed. FDA told states must submitted plan distribution Vaccine Vaccine B (it’s Moderna Pfizer) November 1st.

Like here’s Colorado’s: Americans selfish stupid. numbers prove it. Throw link better sent you. ""Nothing"" literal Genocide committed China, seem different. Australia almost fell situation US taking seriously beginning allowing tourists cruise liners enter borders US Europe, went full lockdowns (several times) majority states week! China resolved hardest hit city back April. think Taiwan impressive, 16 provinces better, including Hainan! what? Dude dense. Children pass spreaders. It’s saving kids. Denmark 1,67% ""Winning"" ridiculous even effective disease control strategies given ideological labels. Mask wearing liberal. Contact tracing authoritarian. Quarantines human rights violations. terrible people irreparably harmed? people Wuhan still complaining lockdown thankful they're alive?

Over million people worldwide dead hand wringing. control damn virus people would alive. better generation would faced crisis knew control disease means necessary, instead feel need consult version little red books every damn thing. take we'd agree nazis bad people right? argue nazis okay, wrong claim outright every nazi shit person?

I'm assuming would agree every last nazi human garbage. disagree _you_ garbage, I'll ignore possibility.

So see, _exists_ point nearly everyone agrees ""fuck anyone identifies X group, regardless anything else them.""

For me, supporting rapist, bigoted, xenophobic fuck objectively damaging country many metrics list, goes way mock veterans disabled Americans, day refuses take basic action could save American lives, crosses line.

And apologize saying anyone okay human garbage meme. Oh step far, huh Deb? people vote dying. know fractions, reducing denominator increases percentage! Yes, will. politicization masks already happened can't undo it. want goddamn life back too.

Unfortunately, we're looking em. Stop freakin testing hospitals work company supports hundreds companies getting hit hard it’s coming IPs Russia Ukraine. can’t wait Joe Biden get elected Covid goes away. We've made decorative wall trick treaters can't pass, we're tossing candy. We'll masks (not thr Halloween kind) keeping distance anyone walking by. cant even imagine normal door-to-door happening year. willing bet lot money Florida, Georgia, states never lockdown regardless bad gets. son way, get candy hide around house. He's Halloween scavenger hunt make lack trick treating year. Call morning driving sound ‘n’ valley. speak state PA I’m checking state-wide charts daily—The daily new cases-per-day all-time high, high deaths-per-day time low. don’t think new cases due testing, infectious disease experts agree that. curious “survivorship bias” plays role this—that people likely die disease, already died early on..and you’re inherently left pool people “less likely die” time marches on. missing ONE new year celebration small consequence getting spread contagious disease control. 

People need bit perspective. Breaking records daily! Tremendous rage state student, take full credit behalf school. path 200k cases day going hell lot shorter 50k 100k. Welcome beginning exponential growth, ladies gentleman.

It’s talked since January... sadly, here. surpassed threshold prevent 10 times (10k cases day may provided us fighting chance. way hell now. Especially leadership running shit show.)

Thoughts prayers essential workers coming months live country zero regard help.  COVID reporting starting feel like global warming reporting. 2018, hottest year record. 2019, hottest year record. 2020, hottest year record. Every day ""the biggest increase record."" put fucking mask on. guys breaking records every day! r/NoNewNormal doesnt enough brain cells understand Well don’t spring test tubes they? Yeah that’s relatively nothing role. paid millions minimum Well excuse want people feed go bankrupt... lots people Juarez also come city work provide whole families. know people lost everything become previous lockdown. know dont care brown people, sympathy. friend, vaccine right around corner. give uni despair! safe, worry friend! Hold now, us wearing masks following mandates...don't lump us ""Za worldo"" However long there’s vaccine. Duh. racket. stupidity fractal. He's still making boneheaded promises making 15 cases total, reality still blowing water. he's right political party, else chances would way higher hesitant endorse masks want people mistakenly think they'll efficacy blocking virus particles getting / through. envisioned net gain infections thanks increased risky behaviors falsely assured mask-wearers. good example Victoria, Australia: legitimately 2 fully seperate waves genetically different  watch totally control netflix, gonna blown away amount incompetence last 6 months + corruption ""It's going keep going Trump administration stating going control pandemic.

Utterly ridiculous absolutely way guarantee working vaccine developed""

I opinion reason going hard mitigate *because* hope vaccine. 

If hope vaccine, let virus run course steady rate. keep cases low manageable vaccine hits, nobody wants hundreds thousands needless deaths, could waited months vaccine. vaccine? point trying contain it. pipe dream actually think contain without vaccine. I'm trying point ridiculous rules lockdown, especially stores stay open. bike Dr. appointment yesterday amount people made look like normal day Paris. Yeah anti maskers would rioted way worse Hillary. Fox news would blasting 40k died(Germany's equivalent) bad job doing. like scavenger hunt trying pick actual text article page We're #1! We're #1!

This must winning heard about. schools already safer lot things currently open USA keep breaking previous records? LA here: lockdown never really ended. I'm saying whoever owns Trump (probably Putin) totally control, like situation let loose monster crush enemies like totally aware helping might things want aren’t. Makes wonder election move goalposts, time follows come acknowledge reality...

It's hard say people Man rational animal, rationalizing animal. -- Robert A. Heinlein feel like needs said. absolutely way advocating for, encouraging, even suggesting ever happen. I'm honestly surprised Trump assassinated yet. USA USA USA Put context: ICU hospital Mom works rural Ohio six beds. Maybe convert rooms post-op rooms. gonna bad weeks nowhere near good now. Yeah, people seem understand huge influence president nation's behavior - that's real driver behind this.

Even tallying apathetic, 1/3 population taking precautions directly president. infectious disease like that's enough define situation. That’s get mold.  predicted Euros claimed victory corona implementing 8 weeks hard lockdown, 2nd 3rd inning 9 inning game... analogy understandably can’t comprehend. 

So Euros scoffed turned nose Americans media continued assault USA wasn’t “smart” like progressive Europeans. 

However, victory claimed, nothing won, you’d utterly smashed March April extreme measures stop covids spread... USA actually never reached Belgium’s deaths per million numbers. now, PREDICTED, Covid returned spread quickly time discovered far late. Forcing another lockdown another weeks suffering aggressive transmission.

What predicted vaccine winners, extreme measure taken protect populace undone moment reopen. way prevent would permanent lockdown lasts non guaranteed vaccine. Otherwise, you’ll look really foolish patting back job well done ravages populace again. Firefox, reader mode. Dominican Republic small island nation boatload cases good alternative Isopropyl 70% ethanol (we use lab decontaminate surfaces), make Everclear diluted water. We've since first round panic buying never stock... We're boned.

Exponentially rural areas wearing masks, taken Fauci seriously, healthcare within reasonable distance... lot people going die winter spring. People die little bit Well, no, obviously not. implying. pointing rather extreme divide within subreddit. haha_im_in_danger.meme Trump administration beat COVID-19 pandemic? wanna die US big, compare US EU country. two countries world bigger you. UK sloppy job spring, ""protect NHS"" said 45k lives lost. US 180 new cases per week per 100k people, Uk ,Spain, France, Netherlands, Belgium per 100k per week), Chechz Rep, Poland. country US look EU. safety measures taken trunk-or-treat? take covid seriously (specifically son asthma), felt comfortable going husband’s work ToT today. Literally every person - including little kids - wearing mask (it required enforced, military base), folks respectful other’s space, used hand sanitizer done, outdoors. honestly less stressful, covid-wise, weekly grocery trip. heard testing piece shit. Literally human trash. No, say do.  Thanks recs! rely mass vaccination strategy? Won’t reducing hospitalisations vulnerable communities using control outbreaks yield better results now? Mass vaccination difficult don’t flu.  stop it, would provide 'circuit breaker' response. would temporaily reduce spread enough stop health systems overwhelmed perhaps enough time get everyone get adjusted changing habits. 

When reopening spread again, would hope much slower rate changed habits health system handle it. comment purely political doofy bot. lockdown either. think reasonable reading data concludes locked weeks ago lock going inevitable. gonna late save lot lives. data month back told us heading upwards 500 people losing lives daily basis, hospitals inundated associated scramble resources people need treating serious illnesses Covid.

We late lock first time 'round, we're late again. also plausible scenario early lock shorter lock down.

So, great leadership all, truth people done enough either. many people can't follow simple, basic guidelines/principles expecting chaos coming months, lock many people can't see result put enough pressure government act. can't resell China domestic goods. Russia American COVID import blocked counter sanctions. People getting quarantine fatigue. extroverts company actively trying get people hang saying 'Its safe! masks!' introverts side eying pretty hard Thats fucking biiiiiiiig ol corner feel pain man, sorry countries put people rest homes prison transfers kill many well. colleges opened in-class instruction getting positive COVID-19 cases, colleges closed students sent home infect parents. doubts effective vaccines be. doubts allowed happy retirement. Bro don’t need bullshit feigned “light” skepticism spread reductionist shit. anyone reading doubts check post history.

Just like many others failures, united states countries provide disappointing outcomes covid prevention. pew pew South Korea essentially island

Their land border (N.Korea) strict border world. That’s dummies USA dont get I'm medical student rotation Wyoming. Nobody wearing mask public. nursing homes town outbreaks sending somewhat sick patients hospital. really sick patients staying nursing facilities die. Half ER transformed respiratory bay half inpatient census COVID. 

Shit good. scant data flu + covid (from February/March Europe still flu) suggests mortality double Covid alone. 

This going anytime soon. change fact countries also rather good realistic counting near numbers seen Belgium Lagging Indicator, friend. Also accounting so-called long-haulers get prolonged symptoms and/or sudden onset health complications. Stop thinking disease like Ebola wherein people get dramatically spew blood die. nothing. worst part Biden wins.. end sentence Italy parts Europe far worse. Crazy isn’t it. realize people instantly die COVID right.? 
Let's wait 2-3 weeks see spike deaths. Well nation runs people virus infect.  Italy...when extrapolating case count today compared US population 179k new cases today. hospitals preparing, population care, state govs trying impress departing pres., health officials get impatient nobody listens. welcome hell, enjoy stay. eat 5 cans sardines day survive, put now. able go see people occasionally necessary mental health think. social people year contact would lead problems. one night much better people, unlikely hurt you, especially smart social distancing/masks getting good airflow wherever hanging out. want mention share sentiment times. human nature so. ask least give moment's thought innocents could harmed policies. 

Let's clear, innocents going harmed. question fill hospitals, people WA state (which generally done good job despite first covid outbreak) rural states deny there's significant issue refuse anything it, want use medical facilities (and continue support President denies there's serious issue). it! 🦈🌝☃️ Land sick dying US going ""Coronavirus 100%"" speedrun funny sad. awful period time USA.  Yeah, already said worried people accompany hospitalized. 

But point making political: that. Trump co. did. denying science. Intentional misspelling ""stocks"" stock market 5k day four weeks (as Macron announced target) never happen million years. country shown steep downward curve. Let’s also forget take best two weeks numbers stabilise onset lockdown. Even Germany, roughly 30% cases per capita basis, 5k per week difficult task achieve December. Still argument. 

*shocked pikachu face* new rhetoric used downplay virus. seems change every week new excuse wear masks is.

Interesting. Welfare payments unemployed (""JobSeeker"") payments businesses per employee (""JobKeeper"").

Also $1500 payment anyone isolate 2 weeks. Yes works alone also. see Italy...for population size...would 179k new cases today...if using population size US. following unfolding pandemic beginning, would notice expert officials public health academics pretty positive view China’s responses.

Of course China responded aggressively claims politicians China didn’t, people would say admitted guilty charged. Buh... keep hearing we're ""rounding turn""? think found troll can’t events 50 people recommendation, agreed. People welcome voice disagreement, they're welcome prompt others break law. New Zealand laughs uncontrollably *idiots* Free unhappy meal every infection. Federal govt created 'jobkeeper' 'jobseeker' assistance payments nationwide available provided meet certain criteria, Victorians. 

Jobkeeper $1500 fortnight payment businesses per employee. Businesses stop paying employees pocket pay employees $1500 really need to. Employees also furloughed still get $1500 per fortnight employers. Either way, frees businesses pay wages workers still something minimal live off.

Jobseeker unemployment payment anyone unemployed lost job actively looking work. usually around $500 fortnight upd $800 per fortnight 31st december.

Banks also lenient mortgage holidays. Allowing borrows stop make payments 6 months. went businesses homeowners, reducing one biggest expense everyone zero temporarily. ""science always right"" correct statement. think science evolve? Recommendations restrictions, restrictions lockdown.

Also China totalitarian shithole even normal times. Europe cases increasing higher US atm. Also US death rates still declining. either confirm deny said right wrong stats increased rates stillbirths alone horrifying. country fixated limiting abortion, US seem give shit access antenatal care protecting lives unborn children Ok thekeezler. here, argument or? Let tell thrilled WA state get covid patients states believe social distancing masks happy use advanced medical facilities get sick 'flu'. block subreddit? numbers high there’s election coming up. like Gas prices super low it. 1 3 Americans hypertension. That’s shit ton Americans pre existing condition lead Covid fatal. gonna get worse worse too, government absolutely zero combat anymore, we're left choices Americans dumb divided whole choose take care other. Remember rule #1: cunt. compassion humans implementing lockdowns killing people’s livelihoods, putting debt, destroying families? Also, nose need covered, case someone’s booger flies someone’s mask? Slight detour point trust somebody. Whether ebay vendor guy youtube random vendor internet.

The bigger question people, like friend, trying dissuade people buy available sources.  Blame press. reporting absolutely destroying Daniel Andrews incredible looking difference reporting Gladys Berejiklian. Agree, I'm high risk person. Today work found definitely black Friday sales, occupancy limit store. Yayyyyyyyy :( *cries Arizona humidity*  what? Recommend masks?  Yep. 
Regardless government, problem appears education system. large proportion population ignorant gullible. China must pay.

They weaponised virus. return king never really started either.  interested seeing develop countries done correctly preserve status living globe surrounded idiots botched it. imagine US Trump (sadly, ""win"" cheating) allow travel UK Brazil grand alliance infectious shithole countries, borrow Republican phrase. said previous post, couldn’t get Americans lock suddenly like over, people partying Instagram rallies gathering. like something going America don’t know? covid there? Meanwhile....in New Zealand 100%, eh? Could full shit? I'm New Zealand, man, I'm good. Trust me, Dan man let anything happen next winter Oh that's right then. ""experts"" mean two them, right? naive hope needed. People edge general. feel attention avoiding spread much higher since last week. I.e. People hopefully avoid bars even distance seated groups enough (fingers crossed). Perfect Yeah that’s problem. could done March April. economy could survive one month complete lockdown. People good spirits we’d this. 

But we’re 8 months looking 2 years total. way convince people now. They’ll say “it didn’t work last time” “ economy can’t handle it”. realizing never economy definitely nitly can’t handle 2 years half open half closed. 

We’ve lost war pandemic. Might well ignore accept casualties. It’s control today Japan announced Chinese tourists travel tests quarantine.

I know racists can’t stand China winning here, back normal clocks 100k per day 1000 daily deaths. Arbeit macht frei. Vote mail, Americans. go polling place. sounds like job won’t last honest. Eventually one person replace two job become part time WFH people two parts time jobs two different companies. WFH thing won’t without consequence many people.   played game Plague? America number one baby! else compare countries different sizes? haven’t seen numbers there. fair acknowledging saying summer coming up. also acknowledges seasons reversed hemispheres. think he’s cautioning winter 2021 next year. he'll lose money working get big medical bill. Murica. cliff island argument bullshit. Even Spain, Canary Islands almost free infections, unlike rest country. sure control borders quite better Spain, island makes lot easier.

In Spain national hard lockdown back March June. Cases went almost dissapear, started growing (like rest Europe). 

It's freedom, people going poverty. greed, people lossing jobs business can't provide families.

I understand countries like New Zealand Australia lesser problem since living standards higher poverty low, Spain many European countries means years years increased poverty pain millions people. 

We idiots, course lockdowns work, another hard lockdown means almost 3 million people (according government studies) go poverty/social exclusion risk. ditched Nextdoor. Issues like pumping chests show macho really neighborhood cunt. Shouldn’t stop people catching COVID-19 well?

You’re telling prevent different, less deadly disease? Lombardy? Washington marijuana sales gone companies raising prices like crazy blows. Stop gaslighting freak, first eradication USA realistic goal idiot can’t follow science 
Like think that’s possible? point companies realize don’t actually need quite people staying home. It’ll affect employment numbers eventually. complete prick go ahead lay logical argument I'm ""in matrix"" ""using [my] critical thinking"" Soon iron bits currency. grim. It’s normal no? hand washing mask wearing. say dems embrace M4A even though 80 percent base wants it. USA!! USA! USA! America great again? Nah trump expecting people vote person. won’t lock anything election Ding ding ding winner M4A Mmm happened nsw/Sydney. forced quarantine great tracing.

Scared drop forced quarantine future though. trust countries weight, age, political affiliation smartphone OS choice. pandemic magnifies reveals existing differences one distinct angle. Nobody cares anymore. Keep fear mongering losers. going cdc numbers statista numbers. 91.6% dead US older 55yrs. assume every single case still 2% mortality rate. idea people draw ""oh 99.2% deadly"" from. college semester ends thanksgiving break goes Jan kids don’t come back afterwards blink, cough? Healthcare human right. Thought way, could demand providers give health care goods services free. would cease business.

Health care lot like clean water education. elevate human-rights issues need to. Civilized communities even US know provide things reasonable cost provide infrastructure matter course. employees provide services government employees work strictly regulated companies (typically price controls.)

Our approach health care aberration continues half population fed lies. I'm hopeful open eyes. Wait, TRUMP SAID GOING AWAY! handle it. Eh, , too, want heartless cunt believes lollipops Unicorns running freely sky. They’re real Trump said were! Oh look,a rainbow! First all, yea effective, thats stopping second wave properly exploding, get back suppression levels. reason basically go suppression rest country managed eliminate virus (apart controlled low amount cases NSW), living life normally, either eliminating virus separated country maybe two years. 

Secondly, hard. rules people little contact friends families, 18 weeks gets you. Many businesses also suffered, would’ve also suffered we’d let covid take state.

Overall, I’m glad it, I’m excited restart living normal life (not quite yet getting there). I’m proud Premier Dan Andrews making tough unpopular decisions needed help state. don’t think it’s viable strategy US, entire country way cases per day began lockdown, there’s point certain states regions US locking like either, either they’d closed borders years, virus would come outside. Shut bars, inside seating restaurants starters. #1! USA USA! #winning 

/s US dedicated controlling this. Imagine showed dedication fixing crumbling infrastructure, overpriced healthcare education. sad thing US dedicated nowadays war suffering people It’s almost like he’s expert something. don’t believe nationwide lockdown legally possible. state state won’t happen trump wouldn’t even power. little hope outside states right thing. course things get bad enough people stay home regardless gov says (obviously good number people everywhere point already). Unfortunately moment likely coming soon western world. eventually crashes healthcare system Italy shown mortality rates stop 0.6% population could go high 3%. assume 60% population virus significantly show talking 210 million people 3% would die. That's 6.3 million would die. 0.6% would 1.26 million. 

Of course multiple working vaccines changes equation depends election. 100% sure Trump gets elected cheats election everything power make sure nobody gets vaccine. Yea, realize china owns reddit, pro china shit? That's like saying Russia amazing job barely reports ended pandemic inside Trump's hideous body that's matters him. illusion virus ever ""stamped out"". going stay. hope is, find better treatment vaccination methods keep controlled within 'acceptable' limits like (deadly) diseases. humans suck anyways deserve planet. trust them, I'm living China currently safely say method working now. one case almost locked whole building down. Everyone get tested stopped international flights lockdowns worldwide people still managed get home flights specifically foreigners living abroad. 

What immensely lazy argument bring forward. hope nets another 10 cents, lazy really net anything stern talking manager. depressing. good too. feel another lockdown coming. governor health world prior election. Idk people voting expect swarm self righteous downvoters deniers, every post draws attention simple, well documented fact Swedish mishandling crisis. Agreed. I’m still things hanging friends, always mask going out. Geography strong point? Yeah it’s actually fun get drunk home furry buddy. lie go sleep get tired, driving safety issues, it’s cheaper... ready shortages now. Death way interrupting supply chains robust one might imagined. stop testing fine, like rest world. shouldn’t let people like practice medicine Sprinkled bunch misinformation people give single fuck anyone spread everywhere.  150.000 people streets, [here’s info protests English one cares. Time halloween parties herd immunity isn’t thing without vaccine. 

Wrong. That's real danger science minimised. town next 0 transmissions, honestly free maskless move around, without travelling towns.

And moment one two cases emerge population, lockdown mask clock.

To degree happening Sydney, Australia. risk 0/100,000, pretty much one masks. starts creeping up, masks come on.

That's much TL:DR, hopefully makes point. Aussies really politicised event take keen interest rest world. When: Saturday, July [The claim: “99%” COVID-19 cases “totally get reference wars water decade I’ll eat sock, let last water reserves overfishing polluting air ocean anyone else.

Ok troll hunter. [Jesus Christ thought !remindme 60 days Brists idiots travelling everywhere summer course believe death count. also think Trump's retarded leadership impact, nowhere near explaining whole story. 65 older care home denied hospitalization

you really believe health care wide agreement deny care? Doctors judge hospitalization happens not, country. 

Since average life exectancy new admittance care home Sweden 3-4 months, covid not, makes sense **not** rush frail patients hospital intubation likely make last days alive full pain anxiety. also makes sense perspective reducing transmission hospital settings. 

It’s juvenile idea everyone sick need go hospital complicated invasive care. don’t seem concept death means. Let die peace chance loved ones side least able speak them. 

I sure examples every country point doctors made bad wrong desicions, could done. go thinking something unique Sweden something *they love bury*, get from? Good point, sir, good point. Thank fuck live Asia people cowards live authoritative government. bus trip? idiot, nobody locks flu, around two hundred years, don’t herd immunity it. Yet think that’s solution covid?? Even Reddit one dumbest things I’ve ever read.

But tbh I’m also grateful people like you. people stupid are, make rest us smarter comparison. wa partially right though: point transmission virus achieves critical mass even PPE, distancing, lockdowns little effect? 

If stay home wear ppe would stop working?

There magic here. everyone meets people precautions R factor (new infections per infected) goes 1, number active infections goes down. fewer people meet (lockdown, social distancing) better precautions (mandatory masks, proper hand washing) likely case.

That's work's. Independent current case load.

If well early might able get ""few"" cases vaccine help. ship likely sailed much world.

If accept biggest issue terms actions ""too little late"" hospitalizations lag week behind infections.

So even everyone would change behaviour moment hospitals start become overloaded would see hospitalizations continue go week. Many cases can't get proper care resulting people needlessly dying. 
**That** acting early important currently. Stories like usually end follow weeks later worse news. really wish people would take seriously funniest exchange I've ever read good hanging friends backyard today! flip side panic attack someone got lift without mask on. Peaks troughs guess. need ~70% (230 million) infected order reach herd immunity sitting 3% (9.7 million) right now.

It insane go social gathering point. Halloween definitely shouldn’t happening parties asking spread virus. Nice. So..that source?.. gettin 200k want get average country right ;) ( scaled population count ) article partakes debate. Yes apparently virus seasonal - one conclude either measurements help harder measurements adherence needed. aim near zero virus lower fatalities - besides one argue either measurements kill economy creates possibilities opening suppressing virus efficiently. both! got first case patient caught flu Covid time Taiwan even letting international travellers? think hell would correct term. know would be, beyond hell. can't understand stupidity country. Yea that’s part comment calling bullshit. Reread comment. prepared individual paper bags candy kids apartment complex know happening regardless. I'll put kids box infront door. also constantly bombarded Murdoch media. country song like 655,000 people die per year heart disease, divided 365 days 1,800 per day. 600,000 people die per year cancer, 1,650 per day.

It feels ""pro lockdown"" group invented make murderous anti-maskers seem less murderous. Sugar pills side effects. average American even hear pandemic numbers lately. conference call work Americans shocked told France 40000 new cases. told USA numbers floored. could see faces idea.

Just average joes working IT. saw guy walk store 100 toilet paper rolls, could barely carry them. feel like lot Chinese government welding people houses. I'd truly surprised combined IQ participants exceeded 100.

I would also disagree draconian lockdowns least germany. honestly comparing US little silly. US terribly.

We also live back basically normal summer germany. Sure ha wear mask supermarket aside nothing really happening. localized outbreaks generally virus happening. 

But really make comparisons countries like US Virus response quite frankly bad joke Yay I’m west Georgia, Trump country through. People give shit.

Here's I've found topic:

[Here's conducted **autumn season** Australia (Autumn March-May Southern Hemisphere)

**Summary**

a consistent negative relationship found relative humidity cases. Overall, decrease relative humidity 1% associated increase cases 7–8%. Overall, found relationship cases temperature, rainfall wind speed. Information generated study confirms humidity driver SARS‐CoV‐2 transmission.

\[referring study 2010\] Temperature relative humidity affect coronavirus transmission, virus survival (at lower temperatures coronaviruses survive longer) length time infectious respiratory matter stays suspended air (at lower humidity droplets stay suspended longer).

**Additional Info**

\[[Journal Virology Flu seasonality\] Relative humidity change size composition virus-carrying respiratory droplets. lower relative humidity, salts respiratory droplet may crystallize leading lower salt concentrations better virus survival. Less water vapor air also result evaporation water respiratory droplets, leading smaller respiratory droplet size. Smaller droplets may travel hang air longer. droplets may higher concentrations live virus well.

[As Short Communication *International Journal Infectious Diseases* virus first gets respiratory tract, worse infection may end being. Therefore, respiratory droplets tend higher amounts active virus temperature humidity drop, resulting infections could dangerous.

A 1% decrease relative humidity predicted increase cases 7–8%, pronounced effect relative humidity &lt;75–79%. almost PHUs negative relationship relative humidity cases found.

**Lastly**

Here's [Heatmap average humidity United . El Paso tip furthest left corner Texas. They've one hardest hit cities US summer strict lockdowns multiple times. Thought interesting. Absolutely. daily rate baffling, that’s 100k shock about. I’m glad shutting down, especially i’m another EU country bad. Yes stated, sure minimizing I'm glad see action question sincerity motives. Fauci lied US mitigation virus mass prevent shortages hospitals. result lie /misinformation disastrous US. Fauci Birx played ""I need play along get along Trump voice reason room"" card...over 200,000 deaths...well, wrong.

Meekly implying hinting obvious lies administration helpful make Facui Birx heroes. Well done Murica. win... time election could guessed Throughout whole thing really proud friends vast majority still taking things seriously taking reasonable precautions. Yeah, sucks seeing much, still healthy Zoom calls. Could've answered instead condescending. Nothing better shit Idea dolphins right now? return monke Rest peace Daniel Shaver point keep defending governor using wrong word asymptomatic meant COVID Made China. family probably benefit negotiating payment hospital. I’m sure we’re reporting many money get. think cunt appropriate word seems way high likely nothing RKI state without big ""perhaps"". one larger study spring hotspot Kupferzell showed ratio 1 4 known cases vs. antibodies. one enough RKi even try estimate something entire Germany. extensive math lesson history. We've learning exponential growth months. told eh? It’s fairy tail buddy. It’s well documented I’ve seen experienced first hand. 20%? must feeling charitable first round vaccines provide sterilizing immunity, likely. I've seen many experts say we'll need keep restrictions distancing least second generation.

Really, expect degree restrictions public life remain decades. France exactly that

Honestly that's really douchebag move, like every fucking newspaper saying stuff ""an anonymous source"" ""a close relation president"" etc get people used idea lockdown. Fortnight = biweekly getting downvoted? really can't say anything remotely negative left here. Thanks!  Cheer up, buttercup! still got other! Chief usually exempt Ah yes, 
The state Canada. fun getting local police enforce this. area, group local police go restaurant maskless eat place nearly 100% capacity. I've seen it. multiple counties PA. Laws matter enforced. going forget Obama drone strikes eh? folks got tested! Imagine much higher really is! hold China responsible this.

30 days later 100 million people locked homes. That's almost entire populations California, New York, Texas Florida combined. 

They knew bad going be. Instead shouting world ""It's coming nothing going stop get ahead this"" arresting doctors trying get word out. feel man. I’m 21 recently finished university (haven’t even graduated cause virus delayed April next year), struggling find job influx unemployed people also looking jobs much better experience me. I’m fed feeling like I’m purgatory state able start next chapter life. I’ve breakdowns already, sometimes it’s alright sit cry all. Sometimes need hug. Yeah Im thinking weather change something this, hear it. 7 months im hoping outcomes bad were.l, though. Shit Dems like stimulus check shit advocating taking covid seriously start. Teflon continues downplay severity disease.

Even dumbass got it.

This him. right weaponized pandemic response. see rebelling public health measures required act patriotism. can't un-ring bell. They're stubborn, easily misled, potentially violent. That's smallpox cowpox based similar enough antibodies one worked other.

Punch face kick groin. Ask kicked groin hurt. think people die flu otherwise clean bill health? 24-62k recorded year die perfect health illness fells them? count *true* flu deaths? 

...Because *that* case *literally nobody* dies flu.

&amp;nbsp;

Rather, actually capable determining symptoms disease like flu COVID-19 ultimate cause death, even someone suffering manageable comorbidity? Agreed. Asking serious question. can’t look learn countries almost beaten COVID simply done. 

Just blows mind still setting horrible records like this. It’s sad. anyone actually supporting new world order agenda now, know say you. We're critical point now, half population actually awake. We've seen media lie teeth, politicians backtrack lie, big tech censor EVERYTHING goes mainstream fear narrative. 

We've also seen first hand covid actually just.. flu. People keeling streets, people filling hospitals. People fine. fact thing making people fine, lockdowns, face masks (causing restricted oxygen dangerous. CO2 levels), government tyranny. 

It's amazing since covid announced, flu cases vanished. flu, EVERYTHING covid now, even doctor suspects might near someone might covid, THATS COVID!

Somehow gives cold comfort. Americans complete fucking idiots this. test results That's really interesting point actually seen articulated like anywhere else. actually Karens panic hogging toilet paper beginning become fervent anti-maskers. would interesting see messaging correlated change know ever data like that. Germany reported new record high 19k today. following calculation obviously bit flawed, population US, would 80k new cases. careful. dangerously close making Trump's argument here. 

Testing rates affect lot things they. least y’all got basketball Even Prime Minister, leader country, attacked leader Victoria. Prime Minister would let run rampant like Donny did, luckily states control. Yep. sort Controversial Sounds like needs mask mandate. Cold Flu season starts fall. Bigly... ever right anything /s look optimist here... doesn’t anything temperature humans behavior. Respiratory viruses spread better cold flu season. Scientists really don’t know why. Look bright side, election wouldnt seem bad comparison would happen viruses ended cell? Could mutate Captain Tripps level super flu? rising similar rate USA

was rising* calculate relative cases/deaths? Yes, examples infections elevators, concern.
But still know infections edge cases norm, aerosol fomite.
I still know people regularly get infected flat flat, like Amoy Gardens case.

There virologists say fomite infections rare, aerosol transmission takes time happen common staircase elevator. Sneezing might change that, course.

Personally, try avoid situations leave space even street. still unsure high population density significant cause higher transmission rate, case social network people different urban areas, obvious settings like public transport use open space offices.

If Japan stable transmission rate one, able hide long. Well shit. dark comedy. 

But also funny. Anecdotal evidence German school: 

1 infected child infected 10 others class including teacher. teacher proceeded infect many others home. 

I honestly see measures work without closing schools kindergartens.

People complain government unnecessarily strict, actually soft, healfhearted measures avail us nothing. AMERICA NUMBER ONE /s There's... lot spread. Halloween Saturday night, right election? Everyone's totally giving fuck, USA, huge parties fireworks neigbhorhood tonight. Honestly, I've never even heard fireworks Halloween before, lol. everyone million bucks country total cunt? drunk guys square. Barcelona even locked lol. cant Trump walk ramp? Hes supposed healthiest person alive  Nah piece shit spend rest life 3x4 cell. 14 gallons hard cider making. enough? need twist knife know.

People dying stupidity President entire political party declared over. gone. 

It's going millions dead like said start. love country, really hard love sometimes. I’m thinking someone elected title “Snake Pliskin” keeps going. funny virus exposed Rogan's stupidity lot people see before. Trump made statement true doctors lying death toll. great leadership shows here. US friends: good luck next week voting! reach herd immunity vaccine found. Hey complicated family dead holidays lonely affairs. Didn’t think good thing year. see light end tunnel.   
    
It’s oncoming train. It’s honestly infuriating someone chronic illness (the chronic illness people developing post covid btw) see people replies say “we lost seven months virus” uh fuck didnt. fact think way entitled ableism stops people taking proper Covid precautions. able go outside take walks visit outside masks go shopping working home LIFE taken away. 

Try able get fucking bed. Try able eat, even plain pasta, without severe tachycardia stomach pain. Try able hold phone call cuz you’re breath. Try able even walk car let alone around block grocery store. don’t even fucking know real loss life is, you’ve clearly never thought chronic illness actually is. That’s many people post covid deal with. Becoming fully dependent loved ones, unable even shower without feeling like youre dying, real loss. comparing fact can’t indoor dining actual illness ableist gross. truly never considered losing health acrually means huh Covid 19 simply halve population. pure fantasy. Expecting nonsensical. Yes prepared worst case scenarios... That's one, least virus. level realism matters. People pick leader days. Obama saying cautious one would listen.. sadly. hits gasoline jumped 40% $0.99 $1.41. Happened kid, ignorantly thought temporary would come back (news flash, never did). Still believe somewhere back mind, still whimper internally fuel (""but, but, but...it's supposed to...."")... :'(  local parent Facebook group, someone made post asking people going make kids wear masks costume masks. Thankfully 90% replies people saying even come near house aren’t giving candy people without masks. Still thrilled number people trick treating, least they’re taking precautions. kid staying home. threefold Yeah seems like he's delegated act gets really bad. 100,000 Well, least according Wikipedia, threatening sue medical professionals publicly question stance COVID-19? 
Perhaps university scared US gov would come action? Depends live. state hospitalizations upward trend summer. several weeks patients inmates flown state medical treatment governor announces plenty beds patients families Healthcare executives tell us otherwise, governor liar. 2021 - hold beer. other's like women topless. fully expect last 5-7 months, course politicians can't come say that. Thank you! nice thing say!   Could explain Chinese attempts suppress information concentration camps unrelated Chinese attempts suppress information extent coronavirus? post detailed, think need simple version. european economies tanking flu corona virus related happen all. easy create new virus types would much problems now. scariest part positive tests. many people actually infected giving fuck? Irs half. Hillary pop vote less 60% voted. I'm sure followers decreased since scream louder. see winning again. still probably 25% though still sad. guy copy-pasting shit multiple topics. ignore them... f*cked America is... maybe so... I'm sure country's peoples f*cking well wear mask asked. 

America MICHAEL JORDAN inept disease control !!! fine analogy. 5ft college basketball player scored 300 layups every week past 6 months LeBron missed every game (in hospital ventilator). There's times worse, there's TWENTY TIMES WORSE. 

It bad America Europe travel outside countries stop (for long time). reason position currently ENTIRELY DUE EARLY RESPONSE. island nothing anything. America took rapid drastic measures, people turn every covid control measure attack inalienable right infect people, would maybe (at worst) 25,000 dead hundred active cases now. 

My country (and New Zealand islands mentioned) took drastic immediate action control coronavirus, much politicians/medical-specialists responsible months-long lockdowns receiving death threats... 

Most people barely left houses months becoming ""touchy"" say least. Even two three day extension border closures causing massive outcries tourism operators (mainly).

I know WAAAAAYYY late anything now... act like could avoided ""had happen"". think better countries, not. 

Your President dropped ball, fumbled it, tripped it, DROOLED IT, LOST IT, FORGOT FIRST PLACE. could messed aiming so.

Trump done absolutely nothing 6 months+, allied states equally culpable. one thing highly virulent outbreak, NOTHING. US government working hard make sure Homeland Security, FBI, NSA, CIA thwart attacks make sure perpetrator face consequences actions.... 


Oh, nevermind. White House owned Putin. wait actual American president take charge. wanna use phrase 'In Melbourne...' I'm sure that's cliche around point, but... geez...

Weather change + school/less WFH + pandemic fatigue true deaths cases. Cases, naturally happened earlier. 

Included Nordic Countries reference, currently along lowest Europe terms cases deaths. Included also Sweden, love/hate country refused lockdowns wearing masks. Sweden however, surpassed Denmark cases large margin. work target people walking around masks chin letting kids openly store know Starbucks store you’re walking around cup droplets tip drink get Covid droplets going get Covid mouth #FOUND WITCH ""Give liberty give death"" bad way think things. downvoted, correct.

Period saying know certain covid continue kill people future longer sick. truth is, way know that's true Winning! four weeks ago, experience social circle.
Several unrelated high-risk contacts, people call officials themselves, able anything tell ""just stay home"". No. big national wave. Lol. True Whoa there. asking question. Nice Still always great thing compare countries though countries testing people showing symptoms undoubtedly inflate rate. Anyone risk lock home. worst. No. opinion people's relatives dead christmas. Keep up. Supposed best country world.

That lie. Recent events proving it. health care system sucks we're nation selfish sociopaths. [praying virus Say want. numbers indeed real we'd REAL panic mode. Likeovie apocalypse panic. Even Florida. People would fearing lives everyone around dropping like flies literally everyone says know like 1 maybe 2 who've died it. literally happening way news telling you. Open eyes. something similar putting candy little pumpkin solo cups glow sticks around yard tree line Halloween treasure map locations (we live country big yard). Can't wait follow little girls around hunting tonight! RemindMe! 50 days would election change things? opinion 45,000 dead people listening? West Taiwan (China) getting lonely ah yes kids outdoors. totally virus spread !remindMe 50 days   Beautiful. ten Australia. Smart. Take one foe team stay home. Ok dude. That's opinion. movements kill anyone. virus I'll self isolate. what. choose stay inside yourself. Fingers crossed India. downward slope almost 2 months. [Relevant Ourworldindata Anyone votes President blood hands. Period. every decline yahoos saying ""see, bad"" People talking exponential growth. true, long. Maybe month. could avoid paying taxes staying home 10 days, would happy it. Really stupid comparison. agree, still think great. That's okay, nobody wanted relatives alive Christmas anyway Evem less 50%.
You right hardcore idiots voting R trump. enough idiots voting since atleast heart. Electronic voting literally impossible secure. US already lot problem electronic voting machines create many single points failure, move voting online, security every computer, router, Wi-Fi password etc. every voter could also become way change results votes. idea botnet could decide election seems like good plot science fiction story. Belgium huge case load right percentage population infected USA would 658,000 cases. Doubt it, so, who’s say didn’t also virus remained asymptomatic. boycott NFL black people kneeling

 also gay get rid fetus want protesting anything unless masks

 we'd also like send us money cities, rural hospitals roads, also stop takers, fuck farm subsidies? god damn takers!  command thee, fellow Redditor, STOP COVID NEGATIVE COMMENTS. want positive course. go, minions, get spread negativity! even guilt. healthcare worker acquaintance going public transport shopping (nothing essential), symptoms positive test result: ""I feel fine, problem. Everybody going get matter get me"" Reported Aye comrade. Pass vodka Boris! Imagine US reached potential lame duck president already give F likely CDC stopped counting flu year. numbers going listed Covid. Everyone age 10. Fine, 5-7 months. 

Now cytokine storm MIS-C? realistic assessment situation telling public truth people plan upcoming deaths recession instead telling public beat pandemic good job. dad Wally. awesome would endorse humor. Literally can't wait friggin wear mask. Guaranteed 2021 going come around Americans stop wearing them. wear mask every day work getting tiresome watching people waltz work mask throw fit someone tells need mask. even it, wanna get shot /stabbed. Literally yesterday many people came register mask around chin.

I sincerely hope people die. I'm tired shit.  Wasn’t study found ~50% control group also showed structural changes heart? Violating emoluments clause good start. Work there. Australia literally one urbanized non- city state countries world. Sean Connery died :(

What done?

Stop egging 2020 on. least prime minister prepared act (4 week lockdown) would take Boris Johnson *him* day He's reckless fuckhead holding rallies attacking established public health measures pandemic. Presidents responsible actions, even whiny babies constantly cry attacked. Adults make choices accept consequences. Tell Americans holding accountable different demanding Obama accept responsibility fucking ebola? Tell me. 

You can't. favorite part going watching Fox News blame Biden Administration bad next two years be. Ty! Cope Another case headline sensationalism Many schools re- closed due outbreaks filing hospitals capacity, kids staying school basis reality. not

Oh okay, scientific factual you.

You're cringe one. Stop pulling shit ass back science facts. can't won't, there's literally nothing proves point.

Block election, people administration going telling Trump go fuck public. It’s going epic. I’m sure eager bring reality back. According CDC:

""You around others after:

10 days since symptoms first appeared and

24 hours fever without use fever-reducing medications and

Other symptoms COVID-19 improving*

*Loss taste smell may persist weeks months recovery need delay end isolation​

Most people require testing decide around others; however, healthcare provider recommends testing, let know resume around others based test sure whether lingering cough considered ""improving"" symptom not, would consult physician workplace guidelines. USA - hold beer Yeah, comparing population, France would nearly half million cases yesterday. becasue populations ethnically homogeneous.
In short EU/UK need kick immigrants - en-masse. Close 1,000 deaths per day, wow Fellow RI resident - really thought gov well start this, especially started reopening, numbers prove half-measures sad. We’re talking using field hospitals start December barely anything it. basically spreading FUD redirect people buy chosen vendors.

Got it. Oh sorry sub 2.3 million people isn’t acting like enough hive mind you. sooooo sorry. Lol “leadership start” you’re referring state governors hospital administrators charge last 10-20 years. States pandemic scenario plans drawn what’s needed cost fine store necessities, chose ignore order lower costs raise profits. You’re truly delusional think virus nature created, unknowingly seeded country months experts realized here, could stopped cold tracks one person “in charge” country. That’s democracy works. Also without even going “hundreds thousands people die” rabbit hole, many deaths would occurred anyway nearly serious comorbidities elderly, you’re ignoring missed diagnoses record amount suicides resulted deaths, would much greater taken stringent lockdown approach beginning. 

This thing fucking tsunami can’t stop continue wreaking havoc. country assessed risks tacitly decided don’t give shit won’t tolerate lockdown, financial ruin, mask mandates, drastic life changes associated these. We’ll take chances. covid look like virus stays dormant forever.

But really know that, we? virus less year old, research immune response spread. remember months ago know people could chronicly ill covid.

At point, know virus spam 5+ years. take precautions fight issues head on, rather burying head sand? everything people want follow rules. blame govt everything. Take blame too. ""this guy communisms"" - Republicans else test children risk adults? Yep. That's exactly situation. feel too. time, situational awareness.

There's global pandemic going on. virus spreads best close contact, indoors, people involved, worse is. matter live state/country sub 2% positivity rate like NY 30% like Poland, socially irresponsible extremely selfish ***still*** think wedding/bar mitzvah/birthday party/etc takes priority.

This mentality society wants taking priority western society absolute shit show Europe &amp; US in. Submit marriage certificate, actual wedding next year, limited gathering bar mitzvah, birthday virtually. agree people want spend major life events alone virtually, would also think want associate major life event potential death(s) loved ones.

This next 60ish days going fucking suck going people practicing level selfishness Halloween, Thanksgiving, December holidays. That's funny. US that. Great observation race win. Everyone's response different. Glad ok, that's shitty comment make.  obviously clueless experience real estate investing, worth discussing you. It’s triage, best moment circumstance. It’s “lose lose” it’s great people aren’t forced homelessness. Us government going make bold moves completely crushed, way “rent debt” isn’t paid government, period. technically momspaghetti looking information.  shutting essentially saying age doesnt matter spread matter old are. valid question average human selfish stupid.

Not american problem aren't. cooked pasta sauce actually really delicious. First time eating sardines I’m sold. Try out. No, we're not. Stop rise maybe. know enough. None cases fatal even serious, CDC reported, one hospitalized. Billions billions. bats. people realized thing isn’t going away anytime soon logical reason put life hold virus 99.97% mortality rate. Consider ERs high turnover areas begin with, able hire enough staff since started. ER 100 nurses/technicians/etc staff January. 54. Yet amount work, more, then.

It's sustainable. ER hundreds others across country similar situations, even worse. Guarantee state anything election. Can’t risk restrictions could change someone’s vote. I've following local numbers (Melbourne, Australia). estimate deaths lag positive tests 20 days.

So pretty close hospital's experience. care community’s tho. 

Individualism really bad attribute pandemic. constant whiner. 

The killer Swedes Swedish policy, critics Swedish policy.  

And particular failure nothing case left vs. right politics, stubborn policy architect seems take perverse pride contrarian concede failed. Nope. customer service, I'm purposefully vague due posting lot local reddit forum preferring identifiable.

Honestly mind us door screener though! pro-tip: make toilet paper West decline compared Asia now. Coronavirus pandemic visualizes speeds up. really need get hoardables least week election countries bigger population density US guess Joe Exotic Well belgium 11 million inhabitants hit 21k today. Almost 700k adjusted us population.

We doubling every 7-9 days since September (starting 400 cases day).

And like increase restrictions, seemed whatever kept rising.

And peak yet wife 3 step kiddos got ours! First year done it, felt like done. Literally took 10 seconds admit wrong spreading bullshit? Yeah man. like Aussies, Koreans, Vietnamese telling people do. actually showed world beat west went nope, gonna follow guys. Idk one chief. thought save economy taking proper measures. economy tanked, societies disrupted. realize taking weak measures worse, people economy. Plus people west give damn ""I'm 75+, pandemic me"".

Asians took seriously, dance around it. governments worked hard, made necessary efforts, shy away taking measures. Asian people took seriously well. reaping benefits, daily life economy less normal.

Enjoy, deserved it. necessary deserve every bit benefit respect responses. US pandemic plan supposedly based learning mistakes H1N1 Ebola. idea well would worked since government use it.  number goes hospital EMT capacity gets overrun. talking USA. get million infections day going mass graves. Soon, 10,000 would reached. sensitivity antigen tests used Slovakia? Czechia made small study two different antigen tests data shows sensitivities [only 63% think person talking toilet paper. anxiety chicken milk last spring. STOP SMOKING. Yes, even weed vapes. Switch edibles THC nicotine patches. single thing weakens lungs exposes greater risk. FWIW, here's reported case/death charts Florida, running 7-day currently 78.15 deaths per 100k. ranks 10th per capita assuming police corrupt, don’t think evidence that. city/county feud don’t want get middle of. city mayor police likely fall saying order illegal using attorney general fight it. county saying order legit. County Sheriff planning enforce county’s behest, makes sense, city police department caught complicated legal conundrum. courts find order legal El Paso police still refuse enforce it, yeah, police department needs overhaul. then, kind caught difficult situation wait clarification courts. Much Europe currently higher per capita US, higher exactly laggin far behind. First hard lockdown possible legally. would unconstitutional.

Secondly: assumption lockdown actually possible since virus contagious. important since means attempt hard lockdown would futile long run. strong statement based study tbh, immune systems infected. think short answer really know. believe essentially order anything wants, order directly violate constitution, choose challenge courts. I'd imagine lockdown seemed warranted regardless technically unconstitutional people would comply.  iT’s CaUsE wE’rE tEsTiNg MoRe! need factor last time around spring, testing capabilities pathetic

Huh? lot good testing time I'll entertain point anyway. Admissions link clearly demonstrates slipping control exact nature highly contagious virus. week could well late, Victoria learnt hard way. gets elderly areas causes chaos. left rock hard place even harder rock hark place. Lockdown many European nations including England simply inevitable point question long delay leads even longer lockdown. God bless British engineering. 

""Do specification"" 

""Fine I'm going find every minute insignificant problem complain, delay dither till fucking sick hearing it"" That's article says. clearly mentions Australia/New Zealand examples compare badly EU/US performed. 

As article says stereotypes useless. People says China got control authoritarian, fail account South Korea Japan 2 democracies also solved similar techniques. 

People say Asians solved ""compliant"" fail consider Australia/New Zealand also success despite Western nations.

In view question governments accountable too. Governments care people, focused defeating virus better off. Governments ruled Corporations tried keep things open suffering 9 months this. Living Florida, perspective rather different. locked little late, everyone seemed think lockdown would last weeks somehow...? 

That's part I've never understood. mean, virus here. us. going anywhere. rapid testing, isolation, contact tracing numbers still small, could contained like SARS. pipe dream--even March, already late that.

Sure, case numbers go down, months looks better months looks worse. cycle like human behavior changes numbers start go down--bars restaurants open up, vacations, weddings, holidays happen--and oh look, numbers going again. exactly surprise see happening. meaningful look % cases hospitalized? would need sort lag data. Trying think severity. odds side statistically recovery - don’t write yet. people don’t realize government covers cost covid treatment you’re  mention it, it’s quite common retail stores security, regardless neighborhood they’re located in. Malls, shops inside malls, stand-alone department stores, etc. Oh god, don’t say that. Scientists believe Hawaii’s true caseload much higher what’s reported people symptoms aren’t getting tested. complete lack humility regarding virus. Canada even one first line Chinese vaccines (which performing well testing) apparently persecuting Meng Wanzhou (over illegal unilateral US Iran sanction less) important saving Canadian lives. Deaths lag. takes several weeks people go infected dead, sometimes month get death confirmed reported. saw April summer too, people said thing deaths spiked. testing demographic situation different wave, soon tell wave look like spring one summer one. it, guys. haven’t lol Black Lives Matter protests may slowed overall spread coronavirus Denver cities, new study protests brought thousands people together, likely caused many stay home, research team including University Colorado Denver professor concluded want kids back schools? God help us want give us percentage people killed Benghazi. gotta lot zeroes.  might explain lack toilet paper Costco. Might go stock up. wrong... bible say that. MEN decided hundreds years later. 

it way before... men decided was...

and happened?  know good sign think find time. results go daily new case statistics? I'm interested high daily cases test many once. think survival rates 90+ still like 85 percent, good chance pulling through. fatality rate 2.6%. GOOD compared majority countries... course natural immune system great fight it. social distancing masks etc getting weaker sadly.. Friday March 6th, 2020 anyone wondering. damn fascist Korea, Japan Taiwan though non-freedom would tell special one directly face give shit family, he's done way damage country president him, believe deserves die prison, he's terrible actor. still think free country right say things directly face. people wear masks? believe weed people... protect themselves... i'm supporting people belief. living rock presidential term?  terrific accurate. video greatest metaphor societal response virus. believe science, also well spread disease. Still buying it. flu R0 1.2 covid's 4, dropped covid reproductive rate 1 summer. actions would dropped flu 0.3.

So see places Covid *not* suppressed, see flu deaths Covid, places stricter Covid measures see fewer flu deaths along fewer Covid deaths? think virus highlighted one tenet lost late West:

“Freedom isn’t free, must earnt”.

The West wasn’t always like - generation experienced World War 2 absolutely knew freedom isn’t free. Eh, whole year I've influenced laser ultra-short throgh projector, bought $aud1900, casting 150"" screen wall couple feet away. Chinese course, they're people make them, leapfrogging everyone else.

That, along last work trip used high speed rail get around, saw nightlife shenzhen seemed pretty damn Western, wealth thrown about.

It kinda screwed whole narrative anything there, need American innovate build. Imo, narrative peaked 60s moon landing, running solely reputation since.

China commiting carbon neutrality 2060 (too late, agree) whilst 2016 US elections saw *not one Republican even admit problem*, 2020 pushing incumbent undermined science perhaps anyone else history, pushing *so* much disinformation making covid journey harder I've kind it.

I like good parts democracy, like see NZ mixed-member proportional, like Western values... carrying increasing amount baggage, we've got increasingly complacent lazy. We're danger left behind, we've left behind, us recognise need actually improve rather trade long lost reputation. need lift game, *badly*. probably tests anywhere else world, information clearly there. Everytime find cases heavily documented. choose believe it, bearing reality. part China covid free, yes occasional flair ups, deal incredibly effectively. Stop letting ignorance get way understanding facts. believe logic convince wear mask virus occurring make group bow anything secret government wants. #1 coronavirus cases* Ha ha, Texas doctor's family practice business usual telehealth even simple non-narcotic prescription refill. think people would know better. That's normal.

Joke them, though, realize blocking European Union citizens actually mean islamic people immigrating UK (with visas) before. Yikes think problem frickin good fighting. kill intruder blowing living room, intruder biggest problem. aged like milk think that? mean scare people self-quarantine? quarantined, would manageable 3 weeks. Illustrate scale 1 10 1 life 2019 10 full housearrests citizens. Sweden 3, Norway 4 Spain 9.

Sweden would 2, recommendations. Norway would 6, Norway almost closed Denmark, would 7.

It's true though Sweden people took recommendations seriously, helped lot. best sources find inconclusive whether memory cells prevent reinfection. 

Which question I'm asking. 

You seem backed earlier stronger statement moved towards necessarily preventing reinfection, helping body better fight reinfection. 

As people milder symptoms second time, necessarily seeing that.  like states, Im sure double maybe even triple cases. ignorant say billion people next cases. Sorry, believe like dont believe counties data.  forgot racsism ended Obama became president known since relatively early pandemic. outset symptom it’s usually 10 days people acute respiratory distress. 10 days average recovery. Longer chances pulling though get slimmer body goes cytokine storm. LONG HAULER COVID TOE 2ND INFECTIONS STROKIN MUCH EVEN KNOW LET'S GOOOOOOOOO “Trick trick”— 2020 Halloween tradition. grandma nursing home got covid months ago fine. late 80s really thought going make started grieving. get sick die. want give hope might end. It’s funny people talk global conspiracies probably also people don’t think earth globe. 

“The word globe comes Latin word globus, meaning ""sphere"". **IF** get 100% infection across USA, take average death rate across country 2.5%, multiply total population, get total death count of...

8.2 million.

I think we'll get high. holy shit we're 9.12 million total cases, numbers still accelerating. Luckily yes! ex sends mom Taiwan, it’s getting difficult get wel. protests legit, Belarus. Neither metric perfect. Raw deaths/cases naturally going higher reality actual number cases underreported compared deaths. 10-12 feet men (usually) ones working.

If benefits work promoting flu shots like.

Take moms mom groups men work groups promoting opposing ideas see connection. We're maybe best making money elites, ""the best"" ways. people America legitimately act like ""freedoms"" people highly developed nations have. ridiculous shining example egocentric, ignorant world view. Make mistake, design goal major propaganda campaigns going back decades. 

Now can't even criticize faults without called ""America hater"" folks. True patriots able see country failing seek improve it. US similar structural problem EU, strict limits federal government’s powers would hard president execute national plan contain pandemic. needed uniform rules guidelines harsh restrictions movement, treacherous joke washed reality star wheel, even quality public servant could constitutionally forced 50 governors play along. problem exacerbated EU’s structure, places value national sovereignty compared American state/federal sovereignty doesn’t strong central government, it’s still kind variation issue — United States Europe, could German leaders insisted Italy cordoned indefinite basis back March? Italian voters wouldn’t liked that.

Both systems government placed premium free movement local sovereignty, things preferable top-down authoritarian government non-pandemic times, it’s definitely hindrance COVID. think real lesson pay steep price ideals crisis like this.  Yay! it!

/s  death rate less 1% it’s like getting flu...I’m still confused we’re freaking much Keil Right that's totally valid, criticising another commenter put ""freedumb"" anti-mask idiots. sure context, totally agree that. careful China _literally_ using argument freedom concept.

And think China right thing here. US handled terribly. super careful ""freedom = bad"" China literally using crisis America's utter fuck push message democracy work, world could look China alternative.

I live neighbouring Asian country also undemocratic, albeit totalitarian. Like many neighbouring Asian countries, lot dependence China. dangerous message, one China working hard now, democracy may necessary success nation economic growth, may even negative... even contrary ""Asian values"", Confucian ideals filial piety communitarianism. China long trying sell model viable alternative. generally attractive ideologically outside China, compared Chinese economic successes, making hay whole Covid situation think important aware actually agree everything he's saying response Covid. China done better there, followed science *in regard specifically* think China model follow. China actively using disparage democracy freedom political idea, need keep mind joking it.

Lots stuff, active Chinese foreign policy numbers undercounted 20-100x. Unless senior, couldn’t get tested. wait 8 hour line wait 2 weeks results. trying follow rules best can, rules conflicted ever changing, never know truly following Take hate blinders moment look numbers surging Europe. pathetic person.  I'm western CO, close UT. I'm surprised numbers worse here, trust numbers county posting every day. alpha-lipoic acid

I would wary recommending this. know anecdotal diagnosed Type II diabetes went hunt supplements might could help getting sugar control, alpha-lipoic acid recommended got bottle. Biggest mistake ever. took hour later blood pressure shot roof, pounding BP headache, nausea, whole bit, first dose continued taking supplements happen again.  connect happened acid couple months later missed dose couple days took thing happened. knew alpha-lipoic supplement left three taking originally. That's hopped online learn stuff stumbled different forums lot people told stories thing happening took it. Some, like me, happen taking initial dose others experienced every dose took. Never figure exactly reaction did. 

Anyway. thought would share experiences stuff event heard people reaction. say hard lock mean get hefty fine breaking cops enforce prejudice. However happen (lots of) America stomach it. can't even wrap cowardly, low IQ little minds around concepts wearing mask washing hands breathing while. Half country actually thinks science works half think work devil. Religion far deadly disease Covid. Sending good vibes health whole family. grandmother (94) already pneumonia twice year, living elder facility end. funeral week ago today; died non-covid related causes, last hit pneumonia basically took heart. passed away parents house side. truly best way elders pass on, peaceful surrounded love. heart truly goes dying isolation, families can’t them. lot people pooh-poohing death toll killing mostly old / ‘sick’ people already unimaginable cruelty. Yes, grandparents leave us. way. Stay safe y’all. whole people can't handle truth saying natural response ignorance truth. 

I sick people half masking chin diaper masking all.

I can't seem go grocery store getting pissed lately. 

They showing covid wings news announcing hospital's capicity using hallways etc patients etc.

I sure people partying like 1999 tonight shaking head. people getting mysteriously, take preconceived ignorant bias elsewhere, unless course something back claims. Ok. agree, I’ve said I’ve said another comment threat, wait vaccine widely deployed, especially since realistically arrive 6-9 month window.

This article, many others, suggesting *even vaccine* could still social distancing, stay home orders. 

Eventually, sacrifice % population. flu, given it’s much smaller. allowing cars drive 100km/hr freeways. vaccine hopefully decrease % population virus kill. question is, % population deemed acceptable? say 0, there’s good chance might middle schooler. Canada broke record 3400 cases 24 hours yesterday well.. Guess wear mask dont become one depopulated. 

OR

The UN trying weed extremists  😞 person met really sound like bag shit, don’t let moron spoil image us. people defy rules refuse wear masks, we’re like that. lot us trying best. opinion whole world laughing stock. Yes are; though appear realize it. suggested would easier contact tracing without taking account administration specifically chosen contact tracing. That's ""fair"", pretty much literal definition apologist. Look up. Seriously. Dont get wrong covid deaths awful.

If that's true plan. good. goal numbers even killing 10 million enough effect much world billions. aren’t downplaying it. Seems like they’re pointing unnecessary, endless cycle we’re right now. look comment history. everyone sub always looking fight?   like think know “contemplated” 

Idiot Georgia predicted 7972 deaths November 1. October 31 we're 7955 😮 know wvwe signle persons true test results, right getting tested every person?  makes people believe globe earth hoax. Who's getting covid mysteriously? Besides current Kashgar outbreak discussed? sources? thought virus survived longer humid air?  came Oklahoma closed door, press, public record ""meeting"" Governor Stitt nothing. Changed nothing. According her, per him, great! said nothing refute him. hard time caring saying. 2020 remembered year 500 year long global dominance West ended.

It's true. America's overseas military bases abandoned 2020. April/May said like 10% chance contracting covid family member. read time thought was
Absurd. sincerely hope right. It’s happen. That’s certain. we’ve ever paid taxes collectively nation anything, address national economic crises like this. family going get together, outside household distanced others, fans blowing perpendicularly between, hours drinks. 

N95 masks use restroom. 

It's going strange Thanksgiving. !remindme 5 months imagine Trump leading World War II

 ""Hitler great guy, misunderstood, he's gonna stop Poland, promise you, one day German Army gone"" Jesus Christ, even hear yourself? wanted get slingshot shoot candy trick treaters. aiming them, maybe aiming ground front them. Instead, I, like you, throwing candy. great aunt uncle contracted virus, nearing 90s. They’ve completely recovered now, okay isolation. Don’t lose hope! wish best! Check *12 Monkeys*. wonder much lined pockets since start covid definitely changed I’m voting 🙄.... smh people Jeeeeez unthinkable horrific afraid. afraid. 𝕙𝕠𝕨 𝕔𝕠𝕠𝕝 𝕚𝕤 𝕥𝕙𝕚𝕤? 🅃🄷🄰🄽🄺🅂! Sure fuck let’s ignore by-laws due inconvenience. WCGW?  fair survival rate still 99%... is. US numba 1 Good. reach herd immunity soon. online advice also get pulse oximeter check saturation. Covid makes people “happy hypoxic” aka oxygenation could suck don’t feel symptoms low oxygen. Meanwhile retaining CO2 people crash. consistently 92 (a bit lower average 95-100 bad) would seek ER (I’m nurse....in nyc). vaccine 75% effective 60% people take it, Covid stick us evolves defeat cure. 

Nobody every thought Plague Inc? amazing proud selfish prick. brother nurse, around time COVID started becoming thing states met girlfriend, well fiancé guess. 

Neither take seriously all. threw fit March Universal Orlando closed ruining planned trip. Even now, booked cruise January. 

He speak rest family anymore. serious according him, nurse, damn well know better....smdh.  point dem-led Illinois leading surge. anyone opposed mask wearing. Restaurants restricted. School online. model state mask wearing social distancing, yet leading nation new covid-19 cases.

But want point fingers pretend like gop bad guys. Well, want strict adherence rules, fuck Illinois worse-off anywhere else? point think us india competition.. first usa made record india followed. us made record things going india might follow soon. look Hong Kong, quite frequently zero cases per day. Like today, example, zero cases.

Why?

They brought law forcing people wear masks. still idiots wear them, wear them.

They also limit number people bars restaurants.

The HK government criticised many things, they've done good job trying balance keeping economy open keeping virus out.

Note Hong Kong never lockdown. wait, humid? studies show humid air reduces chance infection? I’m sitting home wearing mask hoping vaccine. haven’t worked since March like 10 million people. guess sacrifice everyone works home pays bills. probably deserve lose business home everything worked need wait government care us. Seriously, morbidity rate dropping, natural evolution viral infection. point called endemic. also back July. school openings. orange chief said youngsters don’t spread it. 

Imagine wasn’t contained camp. 116 non-serious infectious could easily resulted hundreds more. many deaths acceptable? needs die family realize people impacted actions others?

HIV managed meds isn’t always fatal. care it? take precautions? 

You pointing one line shows zero critical thinking skills lack basic understanding science. Taipei Pride today. 130,000 attendance. Incredible [what's people work together get virus Underrated comment! rounded corner coronavirus US! Rounded corner Coronavirus Drive Coronavirus Blvd. :( I’m sorry I’m usually tinfoil hat person honestly believe “rise cases” nothing election don’t know tell you. guess see cases suddenly plummet election reason Lol what? overdosing copium? lol

 outbidding Trump raking money in

 ""smart"" supporters say, die worst anxiety ovee comes ""what never lasts years"". :( hope right. Republicans. can’t find good numbers around web sounds like many different vaccines currently production around globe even leading candidates aren’t producing ton. I’ve read even ramping million day hard. Assuming 1 mil doses day since last may/june doesn’t net us much 160 mil doses whole world. Hopefully one effective vaccine hopefully producers switch making effective ones. misunderstood me. takes 8 days go infection peak swab test accuracy. Test early, get lot false negatives, miss significant portion cases. going back 1300s make point. Western culture changed dramatically since then. legal apparatus make happen. states that, sheriffs free hand ignore it. 1 state. Please, something actually covers entire country. guarantee gets reelected disappear Everyone keeps talking third wave. We're still slow long burn first. never controlled enough second third wave. wouldn’t say it’s laughing stock

Lots people holding perfect example - although disagree people. fact pandemic going us another year let’s maybe reserve judgment now, there’s long way go yet bodies may take get leave? Ahh good counter argument. We're rounding corner though!! /s

Make sure vote yet. shit can't allowed keep happening cause ""the economy"" ❤️ surprising. believe women magically get pregnant. Perhaps masks help transmit Covid testes ovaries. comment appropriate days. honestly gives fuck anymore? 

I do, would like think living Xinjiang would prepare act containing soon possible. DEMAND KNOW PRESIDENT  

 Obama knows this? I'm 30 feel 100%. feel like lost progress made past years bullshit seem worth I'm entirely honest. Daily mail? Really? USA!

USA!

USA! Western culture capitalistic freedom focused makes fighting pandemic difficult. want government controlling day day life need pandemic

This even remotely true, black plague europe enacted one harshest quarantines known man. left home, killed. block watchman left block, killed. mayor fled city, killed. There's another one though :fine, I'm done error checking shit still taking payment work. one brings funk? people treating like laughing stock idiots think world sort competition right can't.

[Sweden admitted herd immunity approach mistake back people still calling 'laughing stock' people care anything troll, rile people up, remain ignorant. think it’s around 0.3% obviously depends population demographics different countries vary age obesity etc think Africa fine, lucked virus quite forgiving young people, lot African nations veeeery young (average age 20 uncommon). 

And South America basically extension West. welcome! 

Be careful fearmongering prevalent. Fauci correct we'll deal long time, however upcoming therapies Phase III trials (some **25** [per tracker regulatory affairs society website, much accurate others composed media) may well make death numbers even lower.

On top impending release vaccines (4 Phase III now, CDC gave awesome update yesterday [if curious ) things may nearly bleak would try lead believe. Moderna said yesterday they're ready 20M doses deliver end year; Pfizer said days ago ready another 30M doses. put big dent protecting front-line healthcare workers.

\*after Russia China whoever else Donald Trump owes money think would universally considered bad idea point time. Virtually every country earth something gain meddling elections. Giving world US government designed online voting infrastructure attack would WWW3 online.

Although slow outdated, elections pretty much impossible meaningfully attack. There's still fuckery, legal open point like seeing now. simple, scientists completed traceback.

The Chinese never doubt cause, believe science. idea murdered street ist still appealing. Sars-Cov-2 retrovirus reverse transcriptases write DNA. turning corner mean going right way. taken seriously. might different views look like. lockdown Sweden effective neighboring countries. example Skåne/Copenhagen clearly illustrates well cell phone mobility data. massive spike deaths complete surprise happened span three weeks. obviously *not* expected result. Idiocracy actually autopia compared current reality. People idiocracy eye dumb, also KNEW dumb. stepped way let smarter ones lead then. President Camacho genuinely good president tried get things fixed appointing smartest known man world. 


Trump's admin puts unqualified idiots charge break things further, refuses work intelligent people jobs. 

I *wish* lived idiocracy instead... Belgians strange people far stuff like goes.

Complaining arguing pretty much tradition here, many Belgians think experts everything fully intend die every possible hill (quite literally case). 

Its covid, its... everything really. example, I'm architect plenty experience still regularly encounter people truly believe I'm wrong tell basic stuff. mean cannot wrong, obviously can. odds extremely high know stuff better guy works food store. honestly super confused, cases climbing fast? anyone quarantined staying home avoiding contact other? live Canada we've 232k cases since start covid 1/10th US population. We've told stay inside unless absolutely necessary wear mask times part works. Americans care? dissimilar. last president black So, words would acceptable you? Honestly, tell exactly supposed say would ok still disagreeing?

I still think problem disagreement, empathy. 

A doctor say, ""you need surgery"" say ""but take trip Costa Rica"" say ""I'm sorry need surgery soon.' mad doctor empathetic enough? understand planning trip friends six months say than, ""I'm sorry!"" 

What supposed say dude/ma'am? Except ""I'm sorry, can't wedding public health issue."" truth, one rude saying ""fuck wedding"" saying""I'm sorry wedding."" care lot people's feelings really ridiculous expectation strangers internet want novel-length empathizing session end say ""but still can't wedding"" otherwise ""sounds harsh take feelings account enough times."" I'm sure Texas Department Health straight lying numbers (hint, aren't, also actively trying suppress numbers). That's massive drivers pandemic also, going ignore universities conveniently justify anti-science opinion? Lmao.

##TRUMP2020 #TRUMP2020LANDSLIDEVICTORY that's job... *shudders* sorry, thoughts you. 90 year old grandfather died covid....alone. relatively good health certainly years him. really sucks. really hope grandmother alright Lol I’m hoping doesn’t win single reason. it’s looking like will. Well, look Trump campaigning last couple months. still know results published. That's official overcautious. Also Kate Bingham expert. wife Tory MP plan vaccinate vulnerable stop, going herd immunity plans basically everyone else recommends. Couple disputed points:

1) might able hold November deaths towards 50k, number unlikely. 

2) winter doesn’t start late December. 

3) 2022-2023 winter could even worse 2021-2022. 

4) punishment wrecking planet. evolutionary blessing society see fascist regimes suck. 

5) likely scenario human extinction pass technological singularity unleash forces cannot controlled even understood. see chatbots helping spread Covid. 

6) human? equate protests criminal riots presidential campaign rallies? curious LA lockdown ???? question West learn anything. I'm sort skeptical. Neither population governments seem even want learn defend 

White supremacy means can't fail, failed. Hence flailing blaming everyone (China, WHO-- west set staff almost exclusively) except themselves. West Texas City sitting lovely 36.9% schools finally decided make everyone make mask finally. Ok. Don’t buckle get car, don’t take blood thinners Afib, don’t worry taking walks 3AM city yourself, don’t worry seeing fire alarm, don’t worry CO alarm. would want live live fear? smart Fauci, would packed bags better country long time ago.

I'm sure dozen examples activities camp riskier that. really matters. caught crabs, literally figuratively. lot people in/r/coronavirus also think swear sub actually rooting things get even worse.

Climate change, reliance oil, terrorism, guiding internet, nature preservation. Nothing ever gets handled. Oh, believe this. Wait, know mom? Ok Mr. Q FUCKING LIES No, China failed, keep control here. Blame China. second lockdown ? open economy virus hits gonna lockdown country third time ? info gleam guy collapsing street.

It's talking China. dont know going different West. That's I'm saying.

Didnt even say virus mutated less lethal, contagious version here? really different ballgame. Oh no, poor crazy people 

🙄 That's definitely attitude. sad. also pushed SC judge passing stimulus. Nope, separate. Daily PCR test precise. remove people ""superspreaders"" high virus levels body. bullshit. plans allow national state emergency bet balls mask mandate could part that. people context UN Turns out, always knew, stance anything always going opposite what's actually best people.

Trump rallies full people risk... willfully ignoring precaution. masks, close together. Couldn’t dumber. still purposely missing point still wrong regard article hand. Lol - uses word ""retarded"" sentence ignorant sense irony. Good job Trump. Fucking Moron! dont think , plus like 78 exposed coronaviruses past, could help fight novel strain. knows I’d love see studied detail. That's rough, I'm sorry. wish best luck finding someplace family. Fair. Given borders closed 5km limit applied residences though, still far we've seen nations imo.

And props them, worked. may argue worth it, given Australia's otherwise covid- status, immense gratitude Victorians efforts temporary sacrifices. Buckle everyone. gonna ge bumpy hope orange imbecile rallies pass love Covid supporters.

Herd stupidity working splendidly! China 6000 deaths largest population world. Even double, tripple, hell quadrouple less deaths countries 10th population. Cant ask much more.  deaths=more new visas That's hunch. lot armchair experts expect China become world's largest economy either, are. Yes private corporate hospitals full disgusting money grabbing executives yes true cases could easily misreporting receive money. miss part single person actually got ill extent. still fun summer one even hospital. Thank God thier parents idiots coddle breast feed birth 25 years old. sad thing see evidence asia works that's liberal lies side. I'm going lock let people care die. really care all, sad they'll take grandparents relatives them. soon commit violence, lock too. Thus word ""some."" fair Americans Europe dummies average country sure. loses, run future? consider well versed politics actually know rule. don’t think issues people hand washing science educator ask think phase ""believe in"" implies. gives people idea multiple ways view science, chose believe certain parts believing others. Additionaly, people's mind idea belief tied religion.

Science belief structure, way thinking... one would say believe math, idea similar. Science way answering question making claim suported evidence. Science something get decide believe not. 

Instead maybe use phrase understand science behind COVID, understand social distancing mask wearing supposed evidence.

Anyway us knew meant, apologise sounded lecture-y, meant to. However, think important redefine narrative behind science, seen several decades certain groups making sound though science religion... something get chose believe not. 

Plus science teacher difficult avoid good teaching moment comes 🙂 government position I’d call “pressing pause”, may convey severity restrictions also doesn’t exaggerate either  Sure. imagine protesters also made effort self isolate afterwards, least did.  irks us. ""response"" ""well, privately owned essential business. want wear masks, stop you. Here's hand sanitizer!"" That’s like 8 hours worth cases? Got pots pans ready Thursday! Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas’s, New Years Eve. *Laughs Covid spikes* ever reported single day 1166, long way 1.5k. 7 day average never even got 1k, peaking 943. Here's hot take get downvoted for: real number closer 350k 235k, expanding testing can't keep up. Trump keeping numbers down. young people. notion “we’re young nothing happen us” spreading. Meanwhile, two college kids died last week theres confirmed evidence increased positives age following increased positives age &lt;25. Trillions socialism corporations affected. 

Billions COVID. 

There’s difference. Would *die* for? Trumpanzees psycho imbeciles, think, large majority them, that's pushing it. careful extrapolating broad trends anecdotal evidence. Well, that's hard fact twist.

That said, many Western countries excuse they're hit hard. may done well countries Asia, could done **much better**. black white issue. absolutely right, didn't. 

Then post r/conspiracy facts mean nothing you. Indeed is. 

Basically, worst protests, lots people stayed home instead going bars, restaurants, etc. fact, sometimes curfews. time Election Day. cases hometown quite low rally. Every time Trump band cretins unregulated idiot conventions, numbers spike dramatically. googled title didn’t seem listed journals, looks like preprint. interpret caution since peer reviewed. remember UK ignoring warning signs Italy, even though obvious two weeks behind curve. BLM organized POTUS, others pointed exactly sign-in sheets. China lies, communist countries do. 

They haven’t reported single COVID death past 5 months impossible. 

We seeing HBO original years Chinese cover negligence. Ah yes, minorities disproportionately affected virus facing various intersectional health inequities then, exactly? 2021's gonna one hell year... oh yea going non stop tweet storm crazy lame duck period really think European countries higher rate shorter period worse US going strong 7 months? Uh, quicker definitive ways. large numbers deaths recorded COVID , killing given CDC gives excess deaths year (based number deaths per month compared 5 year average 2015-19) 300,000?

By logic, would mean huge spike Cancer deaths, auto accident deaths, AIDS deaths Flu deaths - none recoered. Opus Dei Oh thier immune systems better. shame. kids got go camp none actually got ill real degree. Glad got fun enjoy summer rather deal bs sit inside pointlessly. stop testing it.... one trying simply make people doubt study playing ""I'm asking questions"" game prevalent right wing media

What about? (oh oh. another question!)

That's style. say ""Is peer reviewed?"" hoping person take steps discover peer reviewed, thereby learning that. ""Teach man fish"" that.

I could said ""This peer-reviewed ignored"". blunt, y'know?  What? Japan tests less Equatorial Guinea doesnt like old people two decades now. 

Also, masks dont anything overly packed public transports like see Japan. 

Just News dont appear doesnt mean fine. mostly agree. Without going Trump rally, wouldnt assume significantly worse social distancing wearing masks.

That said, really got point across. going risk lot people getting covid, can't say protests without getting nuked oblivion online. Nah, simply can't trust many people first read article, kid tested negative prior showing camp. Wow. sad. I'm personally vaccination unnecessary vaccination.

In reality, Sweden introduce restrictions eschewed many severe measures adopted European counterparts, longer-term view constitutes successful outcome. However, instead furnishing careful consideration Sweden’s particulars nuances, much media still continues characterize country’s approach “cautionary tale,” headline July article New York Times"" Yeah, got degree Hollywood Upstairs Medical College. health plan.

North America? Fucked. Western Europe? Fucked. East Asia? Fine enough, situation control.  Yeah know. experience working nanny though I’m hard time finding something would hire isn’t minimum wage, since make 3x wouldn’t able pay bills. It’s horrible situation. know thankful I’m still able income. I’m upset feel anything panic. Japanese? Vaccines produced, finished initial trials. approved producing company, must go additional trials FDA. Then, distribution shipping vaccine throughout country complex, especially given Moderna vaccine must stored sub zero temps. 

Administration another hurdle, it’s simple flu vaccine it’s one shot done. Much record-keeping follow need done ensure population receives doses. 

I’m optimistic see vaccines rolling average American around May. would great it’s sooner, doubt it. Trump's approval rating steady 43% closer half common fraction. Might well half, considering obnoxiousness factor. SURE BUD Nah capitalism countries retarded. politic rallies sure! It’s point sadly we’ve likely 2500+ cases per day long time now. Fauci seems right idea. think he's actually formally associated task force anymore, still says what's mind press every often. Guys, wear masks gloves, dont leave house unless absolutely to, wash groceries well putting fridge / shelves, things like cereal, open them, take plastic bag throw away box, wash hands coming back outside touching anything outside, dont touch face, try stick home cooked food much possible. Good luck. Chief's job obey orders

I remember reading ""I following orders"" somewhere else, defense admittedly horrible things.... one understand sarcasm. hope bring furlough back avoid massive job losses. two different Job Support Schemes scrambled release last month even enough *without* national lockdown.

High score good right? It’s insanely frustrating see things done still don’t them. Vietnam zero cases back end Spring went back normal. Last week reporting 3 cases nationally huge story would made sense “circuit breaker” lockdown week reasons mention, however UK always seem week two behind every nation good idea. people know said circuit breaker would unfair kids wouldn’t get go enjoy half term. nephew spent week computer weather utter shit. far know, yes. know much got, seems available pharmacy clinics US. drops flu 95%...why isnt COVID? 30% index patients reported sleeping family members symptoms.
Like, people clueless right now?

I understand first glance seems mind boggling stupid, must consider huge number, perhaps 30%, households America simply enough room properly isolate. likely accounts much 30%, rest made thinking like, “well they’ve infectious past days first symptom, certainly must already it.” Damn

Yeah, quite possible number accurate, forcibly quarantine 55 million people stop spreading like wildfire. alot easier stop spread disease lock every citizen homes weeks basically douse entire city shit ain't gonna fly imaginable scenario government could tell every person LA, Dallas, Portland, NOLA, NY stay inside would actually obeyed spark massive unrest. seems like nobody know knows anyone tested covid, makes really curious statistics come people tested(mainly money reasons).

Are educated guesses/estimations? 100k **confirmed** cases, real number probably much higher. There’s always anti science like flat earth, anti vaccine etc think makes Trump dangerous legitimizes worse inclinations society Thank you. appears nobody read article seatbelt tough fight everywhere.

Positive thoughts positive test results, could you?? could hide few, doubt would able hide world. exponential, everywhere, R rate saturation occurs behavioral change form immunity (which seen anywhere outside cities yet, even exponential increase right now), going exponential decline. Otherwise, geographical movement, testing saturation R nearly 1 makes look non-exponential places.

But balance contagious strain, contagious behavior spreading certain strain, still result Europe's failure contain first place, got everywhere. Patterns time, see daily young, old , middle aged wearing masks, attending large gatherings.

No precautions all. Work places shut employees test positive. allow/make work.

just much work benefit. drove NYC pandemic. saw tents refrigerated trucks outside hospitals. think inside tents? Boy scouts urban camping? Ice cream refridgerated trucks? 87 yo aunt died, gasping breathe, heart attack? gasp hours, supplemental O2, flu? (She refused intubation.)

Here's deal - happening real time. know lot treat started - pronation, dexamethasone two major treatment breakthroughs. vaccine, miracle drug. death rate down. 

The press first draft history. get things wrong misstated too.

But real. also new confusing - people get even though family members do, others, including elderly, mild symptoms, symptoms, superspreaders. know one long hauler initially mild case.

Can find something odd weird? Yep. ship NYC sent Federal government mostly empty, primarily non-COVID patients, everyone stopped getting non-emergency medical care. 

To avoid one daughter's ICU patients, wear mask, socially distance, stay places proven get it.  One statement.

It's Utah!.....remember rallys?

Oh land masonic knock religion.

Does anyone really high expectation? Yes That's one silver linings pandemic, employers empathetic believing employees say sick. manager told employee / Patient 0 come in, would cause hot mess. wonder real death toll is. Supposedly (I don’t source I’m going supposedly) hospitals medical examiners reports altered lower deaths Covid US. don’t put past government point. suspect lot people die “pneumonia” normal. **Individualist exceptionalism* height panic buying critical PPE shortage time science frankly sure whether masks protected people infection. Even knowing healthcare workers need masks protection, knew needed masks patients' protection already enough masks healthcare workers huge influx patients. flip-flop, ""we know people need certain dick like toilet paper.""

It's fault certain group habitually listen science changing stance masks science established even cloth masks greatly reduce infection rates mask shortage among healthcare workers mostly handled minimal assistance group. Welcome America. Land free. USA! USA! USA! article doesn’t say type camp was. pesky red-wearing snowflakes? 🤔 Thank you, fortunately mom believes science. hope family stay healthy safe. Moot point, administration refuses contact tracing. matter easier situation. Protesters also wore masks higher rate better staying socially distant. apologist. second lockdown. Deaths still might hit 1k though, hopefully not. protest guess cool right? Don’t anything I’m sure can't believe it. america brushes we're fucking stupid. family except still give shit. anti-vax too. fucked.

The white privilege despicable. Slovenia 2600 new cases one days like 400,000 USA one day. time vaccine widely available, pandemic probably U.S. everyone contracted then.

I’m pretty serious that. Lol headline makes seem much worse is. 

“DIRE” “EMERGENCY”

We’re gonna die! naive ignorant think that.   met 8 months ago they’re already engaged? That’s recipe success. That's thinking. mean yeah air exchange probably gets rid virus degree keep humid air inside raises likelihood getting cold (or flu?). question is, worth it? ""0.57% locations COVID-19 deaths/million people.""

I also call good paper survey data particular place first large spike deaths. seroprevalence appear scale IFR soon particular place hits first spike deaths. Outside environment isn’t even funny troll. better next time I’m sure Belgium 20000 cases today population 11 million. Come USA better ! Yeah really true. 2 room apartment fiance. One bathroom. Heaven forbid one us gets (we always go together risk, hardly ever see/visit people. Maybe 2x month, masks) reasonable way isolate. What, one us going live bedroom door closed, still leave use one bathroom? one us gets one bound to... Run!!!! Run lives!!!! don’t care Ikr? boat lines goddamn long happening frquency. Sweden socialized medical care lots protection sick workers Coronavirus definitely seems prefer infecting right-wingers.

Miraculously, protests riots last months seemingly done little affect infection rates. Interesting. Get flu shot you’re risk category. countries don’t nearly enough doses entire population (and country second wave Covid-19, exactly priority local doctors either). Get need it. Though, also fair, actually trace individuals attended determine whether event effect. look case rate changes community (or communities attendees came from) event. That's know protests major drivers new cases.

Though, obviously individual data nice available. lifeeeeeee plan doesnt call anything like this!!!! I'm suppose good things happennnnn:(

/s  6 feet apart doesnt help inside half people dont even wear masks. rather wait outside everybody mask 3 feet apart. going make point please least post photo proper way social distancing. problems observed Canadian multicultural society comes following proper guidelines largely right wing white people. Wait tomorrow 100k People go parties, bars restaurants pandemic wear masks. say, hindsight 20/20 Ok, source examples call Covid plague. gotten stupider today. Congratulations? 1918 pandemic 100 years ago, image generation know bad nuclear weapons gone...... shit standford. gathering covid estimates spread. Last night national Halloween party night. can't wait see results two weeks. Well, friends order know someone fucking bottle mayonnaise. Yes. think lot confusion. It’s thinking restrictions needed articles insane mutually exclusive they’ll send emergency alert, still refuse mandate face masks? Yeah, trying really hard look like trying hard. Well object misquote OC. ""Just zoom wedding"" misses whole first part sentence purposefully reads tone dismissive flippant.

""I understand hard people zoom wedding"" said. Literally empathizing.

Look, here's I'm arguing. lost business April pandemic. business owner 10 years employees lay off. catastrophe us.

**And yet people internet fight time saying I'm understanding enough hard business owners** must easy basement dweller friends people lost jobs need **more understanding hard people affected.**

As *being hard* anything recommendations. get cancer get chemotherapy. hurricane comes need evacuate. ""But stuff? say 'just evacuate' understand like leave everything! grandmother's house,"" mean, okay still need what's necessary. know else say except I'm sorry know hard, need leave. that's exactly OC said, say.

**I'm tired people telling understand,** understand completely. pandemic. people even know word April/May. figured happening let go expectations live reality. 

""Unfortunately, people need indoor gatherings 12-18 months.""

""Easy say, understand like cancel something important lose money! People hurting, compassion!""

I understand completely. lost much money, time, investment. *Because done.* think people understand what's stake. think weighting risks showing truthfully needs happen. weak. Trump's son got 15 seconds. /s  Vietnam Okay right, 7 day moving average pop 2200 briefly April  Didn’t order followed something voter suppression ? Like eliminating voters going polls ? wrong, much b.s. lately, losing track... Driving dangerous risks worse crash 

Very drivers accidents requiring ambulance ones grave danger really incredible. told early pandemic I'm going relax restrictions things get better, I'm simply tired careful. thought would consider sending kids back school Canada dips 1000 cases. Yeah, gonna happen quite while... best Well, maybe gay community thought straight people strong incentives use even :) Correct perceptions incorrect views oceanic Asian countries united nation general, typically respect fellow countrymen neighbors result tend things may benefit also everyone around them. also big bad wolf close proximity lot new virus's tend originate history shown always guard next one come. essentially feel handled better west. Nice. Hope folks adhere wearing masks. think could help lot spread.. That's vaccine works. Every generation major hardship.

This ours. fail actually fucking try!! John Wayne Gacy said thing reason ""failed"" free society police lock people home. US better authoritarian counties like China. I'd rather live country covid frankly fascist state like China. mortality rates way people get teary eyed random senseless deaths, matter died. get 2 9/11s week now. explosions though gives shit. Currently, almost 1 million citizens Slovakia already tested! Protests riots large think, spread out. Thanksgiving Christmas month later, New Years right afterward... 

This going cataclysm.   lying. Leaving house anything non-essential get downvoted sub. Enjoy party tonight don’t forget wear mask! NYC 8.5M people got 2K per day height. forget people who, next breath, would argue less lethal flu. Deaths going doctors learning better care treat patients COVID. positive sign, it’s still crucial keep mitigation efforts place overwhelm hospital systems. contract COVID needed go hospital, want go rooms full, doctors nurses drained working round clock, supplies low? Probably not. addition this, deaths going down, still serious disease fully understand appears long lasting effects people. need continue give physicians researchers time understand this. Jews control everything Jews want destroy everything conjunction lazy immigrants work immigrants taking jobs, work Jews. pic another view covid art installation post? Whataboutism Foxnews. Typical America stupidity.  choice life expectancy 65 living world socially distance forever leave house essentials,

this choice presented anyone difference looking overflowing hospitals shutting everything (apart schools reason). France etc made step, European countries follow. long agree said words.

An yes, scientists doctors fallible.

Then, now. 

So ok question them. too!! Think much we've done stop spread respiratory diseases. killed flu far infections covid. refreshing actually see valid point made.

Lookin' love wrong places. mutates deadliness SARS MERS, 18M impossible. Look histories pandemics North America especially ones 1500s. movie Awakenings essentially survivors 1918 flu went catatonic, we're subsequently treated brought back normalcy 40 years. 2,200 whole country, NYC. said, still extremely effective sneeze, cough, breathe tiny drops saliva out, mask stop it. 

It stops mask properly fitted.

But take mask improperly virus hand, goes whatever touch.

Masks work correct mask, used correctly. Oh please. He's young child 2020. Chances name Aiden. Africa East Asia almost non-existent.

Guess explains many black americans dying virus. 

Oh wait: permanent immunity. ends 4 6 months plan BS. least rally Nevada indoors September 20th. May others, time completely research. Plus get chance glance photos outside rallies - shoulder shoulder, marks. curious, living US or...? rambling comment really go anywhere make sense. assume read comments replied properly. JobKeeper paying business $3000 month per PER EMPLOYEE. business 10 employees would receiving $30,000 month government support. Actually done properly limit Covid easily containable level. Depopulation orchestrated Mother Nature, came close number cases go tests go down. number cases *you know about* goes down. true number cases almost certainly goes testing goes down. Dumbass hinted wants keep even election (assuming loses). gives fuck himself. Sadly even people suffer throws parties nearby. think get 100,000 boyz? husband got first flu shots today pharmacy. called ahead parking lot ask time appointment schedule limit time waiting inside. Luckily system record appointments reason. pharmacist must picked apprehension offered come car vaccinate us, course took offer. I'm grateful, think pharmacist cool getting outside minute, too. 

Insanely enough, woman 80 years old maskless walked pharmacy getting shots gave us hairy eyeball. Lady, taking precautions 30s, octogenarian ass taking note. Florida nutshell, everyone. That's nothing! said North Carolina, Hold beer..
God help us all. already sold guys!

Maybe there's return policy somewhere. maybe someone else interested taking us back.

Anyone? Help. realized made mistake. actually happen science, never cults. CDC absolutely botched this, lying airborne spread, basically creating non functional test early days, hampered everyone's response.

The US leader free world institutions like CDC. Was. Wonder happened CDC WHO? obviously mystery. keep wondering if, end, traditional vaccines, ones use dead-virus, winners vaccine race. create sterilized immunity stop disease—more controlled inoculation. Introduce virus controlled manner early help build immune response need. 

I also wonder gives credence idea coronaviruses introduced population. Indeed, maybe Russian Flu actually introduction one common coronaviruses. experiencing exactly then. 

The truth time goes on, people get immunity minority won't. people get reinfected, majority won't. people milder cases, others worse. reality going away anytime soon, get better get better treating it. Thanks hard work USA Thanks heheheheheheheoh likely, something substantive waving white flag surrender like current “administration” has. Deathrate 69 per 100000. nice. no, social media deserves blame. Sure, blame government, social media responsible masses people believing hoaxes. conspiracists hoax front every day years, would less likely believe Trump bullshit similar stuff, they'd likely trust scientists. us threatened move Canada 2016 regretting actually it. 

I hear right wing media caused many Canadians less cautious, however. What's take that? So, based logic, economic well-being threatened, treat others, specifically underprivileged group, second class citizens. Speaking flawed arguments, literally ones Apartheid regime Southern slaveholders made. 

Which especially rich you’re saying safe somewhere, Internet. economic situation may may stable right now, scenario toss civil rights window. Without them, leave lot people nothing lose—economies, much less societies, cannot function conditions. Hope feel better soon Kamelman Ahh, Foxnews retort. Stop narcissistic superspreaders ongoing now. 1 5? overhear people talking stuff almost every day. 

Especially recent bad news surrounding vaccines last couple months (Polio vaccine Africa, Oxford Trial, Flu Vaccine Korea), vaccine skepticism seems time high. Yeah understand. I've states couple times majority people lovley. 30% still massive amount. like 10% I'd agree 30% much complacentcy imo. Yeah sure hey, it’s got relieving know President lists “ending COVID pandemic” one first term accomplishments right? okay okay. sex bat bit person. advanced std went airborne. sorry. please move on. No, what’s big deal wave heights tomorrow wear shoes not.  THIS.

WTF wrong people? I'm 100% 24/7 gloom doom covid, good mental health. underlying grief massive numbers people dying every day. 

Why national mourning?

It's like 3-4 jumbo jets crashing EVERY DAY. 

Think memorialize 9/11, Oklahoma City, Pearl Harbor, etc. Yet crickets 230,000K growing every day. developed world busy managing numbers laugh anyone else. attribute malice apathy suffice. 1 5...in U.S.A....thats 1 1 million rest developed world. Doubtful... maybe Mormon wards went full attendance distancing once.

What I’m truly worried right extra people going die long term consequences lack medical care.

Utah’s medical facilities staying level 400 cases day. 2000 day? 50 100 people need ICU help per day!! heart attack, stroke, serious accident next months seriously dangerous face lack room tech hospitals. Outside. people wearing masks. nurse Maine trump rally, took photos super close people unmasked, went work emergency departments hours later. Usually enemies inside WH. don’t know is, live beach keep self:/ certain one index case? Couple hundred skyrocketed 2000+. done best respect diverse opinions regarding COVID-19 past months. 

Please take politics read open mind using common sense.

Anyone tell end game covid 19?

What magic formula going allow us sound clear?

Is zero cases?

The way happen stop testing stop reporting.

Is vaccine?

It took 25 years chicken pox vaccine developed.
The smallpox inoculation discovered 1796 last known natural case 1977.

We flu vaccine 40 60% effective less half US population choose get one, roughly 20,000 Americans die flu flu complications.

Mandate it, like vaccines mandated order attend school, travel foreign countries, etc.

We already growing number anti vaxxers refusing proven, tested, well known vaccines administered decades aren’t necessarily safe. 

Do really think people flock get fast tracked, quickly tested vaccine, whose long term side effects overall efficacy anyone's best guess?

How long going cancel postpone reconsider?
You person school later?

What Q1 2021 numbers Q4 2020?

What 2021 numbers worse?

When decide quality life outweighs risks?

I understand Covid deadly dangerous people, nuts shellfish.

We take risks multiple times day without second thought.
We know driving car dangerous, leave garage. Many speed wear seat belts.

We know dangers smoking, drinking eating unhealthy foods, anyway. new “a part plan” like Joker states Batman. Everyone panics life doesn’t go according plan. 

We’ve accepted accidents occur rush hour, food poisoning, flu viruses, operating equipment operating chainsaw. 

When quickly lose free give liberty?

Is waiver somewhere sign says, ""I understand risks, choose free life?

I understand minuscule possibility could die, likely end feeling like crap days. 

I understand could possibly pass someone else, I'm careful, pass virus onto someone else.

I'm struggling see ends.

What's kills us causes hearts stop beating. 
It's prevents us living. 

We're guilty fear. Allowing fear hold us back taking leaps chances. Making uncomfortable choices. Making scary choices. Going stream life. We’ve become accustomed fears risks, integrate this? 

We tragedies, fears losses must find ways face order live. trains like Tokyo now? remember packed pre-COVID. changed? Jeezus 80k like week ago. going fast. Awesome, another semantical response. obviously can’t read would’ve noted already acknowledged sentimental aspects monarchies. *Masked, outdoor marches* vs stationary cult meetings people rally behind fallacy pandemic virus lethality overhyped 
 
I expect understand we're great though! trying enable everyone get infected Let’s go!/s haymakers 

What phrase mean? Yes lot people enough say ""the American way."" see TV ""America."" things make news. thought said Christmas welcome sir.  One man says: ""I shall go around whoever comes near me, shall threaten take life. want live, shall remain locked away"".

Other man says: ""Lock one man instead""

That one man again: ""Oh that's gruesome fate, spoke fatal judgement?""

Other man again: ""You did"" find curious generally closer country epicenter outbreak (SE Asia) better seem doing.

I absolutely evidence this, surprise found countries already built-in immunity previous exposure similar viruses. Thank Happened Iran much earlier pandemic. also read someone r/COVID19_support say close relative collapsed right outside hospital released hospitalized COVID ended dying. you, Georgia. Rational reasonable thought welcome here. receive memo? agree big empty part comment. live South Dakota, state US low population density much like Australia. Right terms cases percent population South Dakota one worst world. Yesterday 1559 confirmed cases. entire US proportion would 600,000 cases day (with 40%+ positive test rate). 

I'm wearing mask, social distancing, right stuff, way many fellow South Dakotans result even super low population density.

Asians collectively done great job need common good, Australians obviously too. know nobody really going use masks like trained medical worker. said, still extremely effective sneeze, cough, breathe tiny drops saliva out, mask stop it. Combined 2 meters social distancing rule, everyone wore mask could find distance themselves, covid would walk park. think vastly overestimate amount employers would risk outbreak staff single person feelings hurt Uh. That's...not even realm possibility. god, really hope do. mistake posted Jan 1 article December. reaction funny Hell, I'll take Cliff Robertson President administration. Sure, position extreme, least ascribed ethos. knew Facebook would end Western civilization?

**Eyes Putin raise hands**

When money, Zuckerberg, let's grab brains! seriously, Facebook basically cluster fuck competing corporate / governmental neurolinguistic programming.

Multiple alternative forced choice powerful tool study things, also works backwards let's drive behaviour. instead determining one layout elicits certain behaviour / reaction, instead search layouts elicit behaviour via random walk, put everywhere.

Facebook basically makes easy manipulate populations grand scale Zuck makes money this, stupid penis pill ads whatever. numbers pointless since death rate staying same. Like literally exact less compared lowest numbers year. Seriously go look early September saw around 35k 7 day rolling average infections 7 day rolling average around ~780, deaths. Right 7 day rolling average ~77k cases ~800 deaths 7 day rolling average. death rate dropping lethality going down. long deaths keep dropping virus continues show less deadly reason panic rising numbers. say people Kentucky vote, unfortunately. can't much McConnell. Look around, US 50/50 split. patriotic died long time ago. every person Youre concerned constitutional rights freedom? 30% still 100m fuckwits sadly. Agree author article though. seems fueled exceptionalism places.

Even within Europe seen Italian problem late earlier year. Even noone paying attention countries. Everytime cases start rising new country, still hear people explaining problem date rate hasnt started increasing yet.

Its like people assume happening elsewhere cant happen them. Nothing sending kids door door asking hand outs won’t fix. lot longer time, though. people biggest hypocrite I’ve ever met. Grew Mormon, left reasons like this. Practice preach Utah! 116 cases, single serious one. many died per day beginning?? “we” do? argument would valid talking deaths/hospitalizations terms infections dropped ball. Also, set low standard low deaths measure success, consider leaders didn’t know percentage infected would died, failure dependent letting many people get infected did. like south USA worst infection rates per million, maybe deaths that’s based luck opposed direct responsive measures. Then, one time...at summer camp, stuck corona virus throat. Ugh really? That’s pretty tasteless irresponsible would consider outdoor spaces low-risk long overcrowded. Cold NYC right though. Yes far places happening, cases number people died directly result pretty insignificant overall numbers. I've idea Instagram Twitter social media, could pushing accomplished there? simple ""no"" would sufficed. clear, states protests see sharp rises cases, rallies did. could say ""invisible ally,"" using strawman argument here. claimed every covid death caused Trump US. Trump terrible president. would still covid deaths America matter president was. nearly many. fine that’s neighborhood treating it. That’s point. acting like everything totally fine, let’s swarms kids cram every doorway together grab stuff big bowl engineering degree, strong suit 


No, not. clearly showed.

Is degree civil engineering? 

I take class, engineering economic analysis, civil engineers kept complaining hard easiest class semester. literally got one question wrong whole class carelessness.

I used think want anything people built.

You seem like could one people. missing point. entire talking point pounded right wing circles children affected this. (And even adults severity willfully exaggerated political reasons)

Common sense come play truly believe issue needs guarded against. sub would enjoy that, highly unlikely eradicate damn well tame control. Take supplements. won’t hurt long take what’s needed. can’t get supplements get sunshine often can.  looking worst case scenario...but fact disease 100 percent fatality rate infinitely easier contain disease .06 fatality rate. Covid made every person caught start puking blood...you betchya would easier get people board containment strategies.

Now guess true nightmare scenario disease 100 percent fatality rate shows symptoms several weeks. would bad. release vaccine towards beginning 2021, shown effective. Infection numbers disease severity goes bit, escape mutant arises, happens hundreds thousands infected every day. vaccine efficacy goes infection numbers go up. People world get really fed go back normal, matter cost. 

So, normalcy, around next summer. One way another. get disease couple times per year, pneumonia years ahead. 10 years get 3rd generation evasion-mutant resistant multiple epitope vaccines disease becomes longer problem. Correct. gave world numbers. math it’s quarter million US citizens high risk death. protests? lakers celebration? think means widespread. course undetected cases, it’s nowhere near level countries there. Masks prevent virus. fair ""a bit"".

People rallies also stand shoulder shoulder, screaming cheering. masks.

One clearly worse other. specific ideas? could always pass researchers. Lmao Thats horrible example tbh... cant say thats incorrect evidence supports statement, look midterms, polls, numerous republicans supported trump 2016 dont now, publications used support republicans trump. Im sure there's metrics prove point, least much better anecdotal evidence.. 

 
plus tweeting dosent help, 230,000 americans dead, hypocrisy, whining complaing,the lack leadership planning, frequent controversies , childish antics like trying piss people pisses off. shitty, cavalier attitude healthcare worker too...I hope read riot act. Would explain far east lightly affected comparatively rest world think definitely happen states, situation much dire even July others dead caught covid. claiming administration effectively ended deadly disease weekend country record breaking number cases almost 1k deaths. Sure unavailable deemed high enough risk. can't even spell people think scathing UK hear US screeds. Yes. prelude global warming Yeah contributing somebody else’s death much better. Also, I’m sorry many commenters seem little home think endangering lives much worth it. first month pandemic gorgeous weather lived husband ordered hammocks spend days wfh laptops hammocks backyard. got hot set projector watched movies pool evenings. started Etsy business making lots art finally started remodeling kitchen.

 Second, flu vaccine varies 40 60 percent effective. read COVID vaccine would same. people get flu even they've taken flu vaccine, get hospitalized die rate. die. catch flu. 

Given cultural desire absolutes, middling effectiveness rate negatively impact rate people take vaccine, likely get it, spread it, die it. (Remember antivaxers?)

That's problems vaccine. Masks absolutely prevent virus. perfectly, significant reduction. 

Far better inside rally everyone screaming chanting without masks. We’ll probably get downvoted agree haha Thanks! lockdown buys time public space implementation comprehensive strategy. There’s 50 different things need conjunction lockdown. UK none them.  worst statistical masturbation read. talking ass. Mask objectively shown slow halt spread. Playing semantics negate fact there's significant number users subreddit hold ""I'm done"" opinion. can't even convince people corona virus subreddit, hope populace large? Keep standing oppressive regime. Nice work. It’s ‘Sherlock’ jsyk.  think OP also misunderstands censorship authoritarian regime like China works: scientist, unless stray areas politically sensitive, largely left alone research. addition, censors stupid thick understand subject-matter specialized scientific field, really much.  


The true Soviet Union, produced excellent scientists.  


You really need multi-party democracy scientific superpower. I'm liberal democrat believes multi-party democracy, predictions China decline democratic strike wishful thinking. That's right. Guilt Vs shame stuff reading much it, opinion First image safari “BLM Protests” image “Trump Rally” willfully ignoring reality want pretend like type people Trump rallies take Covid seriously think BLM protestors don’t. great, info layman, little showing me/them what's happening bigger picture. whole thing could powerful beneficial everyone know nothing 😕 restrictions imposed holidays predict daily cases going multiplied number larger 2, think without lockdown would runaway effect leading millions cases day One set people standing believe right. licking asshole Trump’s ego Also, protests point. Marches like [this draw attention inequality prompt people push status quo.

Trump’s rallies full people already support says exact things every rally. says exact thing Twitter. could go read Twitter feed right sound like rally.

Trump ego. even turned official coronavirus updates campaign events. One caused individuals deciding go streets (usually masks on), one organized *president himself*. Stop acting like they're comparable called 10k fine catch you. different approach would cause significantly different death rate ours? Saturday numbers start going down, Sunday low, Monday lowest Tuesday either pops modest. Wed-Fri worst. lower Tuesdays #s worse wed is.  That’s pattern states Practically western democracies failed delivering accurate information numbers virus.

Due lack testing, numbers underestimated. People told ""stay home tough can"" (this UK) even counted.

In democracy, outrageous. Government opened numbers must aimed accurate possible. journals scientists could analysis publish proper results.

(Online news sites television aims highlight bad skew presentation what's actually going on, fear 'sells better'). Yeah, can't help thinking last time saw grandpa might last time ever see him. medical issue likely needs surgery soon, hospitals El Paso full Covid patients. I'm still traveling holidays. Wait, typo? Didn’t Johnson come office tail end American civil war? mean... droll topic, curious Ok fine. Let's say lot protesters wear masks.

I’m saying protests caused cases, reopening would factor. way (hypothetically) would non-lethal virus causes sterility younger people.

Its going long fucking winter. yepper Nationwide, [comprehensive correlational showed anything NEGATIVE correlation state protest participation percent increase summer cases. protests significantly increased cases, least positive correlation. I’m usually anti echo chamber position, case, man, people making disease., virus less half 200,000 deaths far.  Everyone praising well New Zealand handled this, country 275x people less deaths since May even NZ did? Breaking news, water wet.... least Australia protests held year covid events everyone really careful distancing masks appropriate. guess combination usual culprits protecting everyone simply nobody wanting put movement disrepute.  fact is, people TESTED POSTIVE quarantining. silver lining vaccine trials sped due infections Oh think we’ll hit 200,000 sooner 2 months point, remember exponential growth means speed case numbers go accelerates Public ? mean idiots lol  even that, Pfizer front runners get approved still enough doses right away developed world anyway. one shot, J&amp;J far behind approval anyway. Apparently, that's takes pro-lockdown people prevail.

Could happen here? might. Fine, honest say think risk spreading covid worth it. try gaslight everyone say certain gatherings harmless simply like politics involved.

I’m sure protests contribute COVID cases. Talking may make feel better, discussion COVID cases political rallies.

So IFR obviously LOT higher 0.4%. right, people think fucking stupid. protestors also wore masks bust study backs saying id start beleive you. course not, Science politicized tool rather way understand facts. believe Trump rallies super spreader event, mass protests across country, logically inconsistent actually give fuck Covid, 200k+ deaths. care right.

Real influenza flu scary lasts longer Oh we're rounding corner right, next wave deaths. unfortunately ending years, hope employers require vaccine least places safe others. like freedom find job elsewhere cannot blame people USA wanting quarantine, lives depend working getting salary.

No work = pay = starve. That's go work sick. RemindMe! 2 months “cases doubled without sign restrictions lockdowns” look graph America's daily covid cases, there's huge bump starts week two June. bump exist countries. specifically said partial immunity. 

1. Based antibody studies, conclude 20% New Yorkers infected (varies town). 

2. Based low # reinfections think it’s likely high % previously infected still immune. 

3. still rising daily cases 20-50% population immune.

It sounds like think either 1 2 wrong both. agree it’s possible. 1. antibody studies could false positives. 2. Reinfections could severely underreported still early know studies long immunity lasts people.
I still think 1&amp;2 likely true, understand could wrong. Time tell suppose Hello, sarcasm??  social distancing decades guys. Welcome new normal

You know that. scientist crystal ball stop saying shit like that. Loss smell strong predictor Covid, would notify close contacts isolate get tested even get results. happen unless government wants civil war. basically happen attempt hard lock made course wants president. He's career politician. fucking serious? THaTs 2% dEaTh RaTe wHatS bIg DeAl?! really think people understand much sucks boat like long.

Especially since going receiving extra compensation suffering, forced situation will. different ways recording reporting numbers. one ""right way"" this. world messy, matter try categorize everything neat little boxes, universe continue laugh us throw us curve balls.

I explain PCR test works though, help understand what's going there. 

When specimen collected, includes lot stuff it. Bacteria, viruses, mucus, skin cells, detritus breathed in, etc. removed leave behind virus particles need test. COVID-19 identified certain sequences molecules call RNA. RNA like DNA cells. contains instructions cells follow produce virus particles. 

Different viruses different combinations molecules make RNA. make molecules bind specific sequence RNA define COVID-19. mean, find sequence virus's RNA distinguishes viruses, make molecule bind it, sequences RNA.

Now, need detect molecule bound RNA question. problem is, RNA TINY, possible really look see. Instead, use chemical tests recognize bound molecule, tests require LOT sample function.

We convert RNA DNA simple chemical reaction, use molecular machinery exists cells make DNA replicate over. sequence molecules made RNA correspond sequence molecules new DNA made, test specific sequence. need MILLIONS copies DNA though tests work, that's replicate many times. 

Say hundred thousand usable RNA DNA samples original specimen. Even person COVID-19, vast majority going things testing for. time finish initial process filtering care about, binding remains specific markers remove stuff COVID-19 RNA, converting DNA, going much material left work with.

Even large virus going 0.000000001 grams RNA. So, duplicate make it. duplication process going change material have, make it. round do, duplication material, bind properly. rest react. Chemistry messy way. every duplication round increases amount material 50%, 50 rounds duplication get 1 mg material test.

As process run, probes get stuck fragments DNA match patter looking release visual signal use detect duplicated. release signal, match, test negative. 

This also infected still test negative. enough virus particles get enough specimen collect nose, enough survive process, signal weak detect positive. Deep seated think start year running article article bad China handling pandemic

Now entire China's worth cases day fucking hate Trump Ultra cringe comment. Yeesh. problem everyone believes science already wearing mask. rest screaming ""fake news"" burying loved ones.  Let's kill anyway can(See: Hitler 1945). reported months, one pays attention. Take vitamin supplements folks. good podcast Dr. Rhonda patrick Joe rogan. Kisudvarnok

Marha, Eperjes, szomszedok vagyunk. agree.

If someone said 30-40 years ago China much cheap labour assembly plants, maybe would've laughed them. step step, outgrew product designers, investors 'colonizers' (in Africa, example). think part mortality rate decrease could attributed ability identify cases community increased testing screening? I.e catching 1 10 cases April, 1 5 cases June 1 3 august? Positivity rate decent estimate. article talking indiana wisco idk linked wrong would 100% board held protesting similar light. seems get pass left wing politics reason.. mayor pushed schools reason. schools didn’t open fast. Nobody keep up, either vaccine nothing west. vaccine, less go back normal healthy. not, western world population half-crippled end, multiple infections Covid. Yes, possible viruses survive humanity tend evolve contagious less deadly forms.
But result many generations; unlikely something happens months Based happened China, rate infection deaths, much rural country, government's inability get things done efficiently.

This assumption made week first case.

I however think government would nothing, also expect intercept PPE deliveries spread propaganda downplaying virus.

I also expect giant portion country become anti-maskers still large gatherings.

It's hard predict upcoming election winter coming (meaning people inside time open windows)

If guess baseline now...500k dead, trump gets re-elected probably 2 million+ googled read bit him! interesting case. Unfortunately, event Biden wining election, see trump’s die hard supporters pushing run future. Hopefully Republican leadership would willing stand him... maybe he’ll prison self-imposed exile! high risk people access vaccine dramatically reduce risk death complications refuse proactive getting one, low risk people continue put lives hold? Remember guys, actual responses, sort controversial Government should’ve done help fund lockdown. become serious contact tracing isolation afterwards. Thugs*

You think data twisted make trump look bad? Come man, wake Like Federal Government nothing COVID was....... wish apathy crime, cos holy fuck deserve part society care it. 2... realize economics pandemic countries lock harder actually better economic recoveries don't? *fires Hannibal good girl keep Perfect Peggy bay* take CDC contact tracers 90 days solve mystery? mean sexual behaviour changed?

Weeeeelllll maybe, masks proven highly effective anyway, matter much. keep saliva jumping mouth, so. Wow didn’t know schools. opinion still think it’s soon schools open.

Halloween nothing scarier something basically shut world year. definitely right. Florida example pushing 20k cases day. However, looking per capita data also pushes narrative America country way worse everyone else, look per capita vs raw data build two different stories. There's plusses minuses every per capita vs raw data stat. need take get full picture. Raw data country 330 million people make sense comparing countries 60 million. 10 million etc.

Oh want. consequences keep changing. hope makes it!! made way 91, sure make this! not, made lot people jealous amazing age. best!! possibly could achieved great results less severe lockdown -- apparently cases starting drop introducing mandatory masks top lighter restrictions. However, soon went harder lockdown, hard know things would gone lighter lockdown + masks only.

Whether best approach not, work, great position. also given time state government hopefully get contact tracing capabilities place continue suppress new outbreaks.

In short, think confidence face near-zero daily new cases great economy (after huge cost lockdown), potentially better economy fear uncertainty comes rising static high case numbers. patent still started production yet, downvoted article literally explains this, reading it, saying first thing comes mind issue Canada makes incredulous. People responses like “cops need enforce real crimes” even though it’s by-law. could go wrong start picking choosing laws matter? paramedic I’ve asking patients cough put masks since March.

Mayor said unfair city shut region dragging city shutdown, absolute bullshit higher positivity rate region anything, we're dragging region down. 

He's ass pray gets voted next time. Than? Sweden?

Doesn't matter. Every time scratch surface platitude there's nothing underneath. masks proven highly effective anyway,

n95 ones ok, cloth ones much less multi-plly micro-fibre. 

But either one a) fit b) touch c) replace wash use.

And *tons* people dont that. dont still spreading. way see distributing vaccine may need heavily armed security behavior USA citizens potentially violent extremists may whatever takes knock supply chain. small issue 1 month lockdown end covid It’s fake news, it’s really big deal many cases...how many people die Car crashes day? doesn’t matter, it’s fucking thing live now. sex without worry catching deadly virus? comparatively recently treatments restored life expectancy HIV. work school. week Thanksgiving, I'm going super self preservation mode. already wear mask lab protective glasses, also wear gloves, materials submitted virtually, I'm moving front room. Shit, get hands N95 KN95 masks? last time licked homeless man's asshole? imagine flu deaths could avoided decades people worn damn mask stop touching things time.

Most people know (America) still think coronavirus hoax, even though people families died it. swear doctors making cause death. zero faith we're ever going able get control. rest world better pass laws blocking Americans traveling abroad, build two-week quarantine shelters travelers stay enter country. we're going damn thing here. probably best look media interpretations future. Fauci lots professionals say it'll next year vaccine properly rolled out, gigantic guess. 2 weeks election numbers explode. 


2 weeks thanksgiving another explosion. guys get new record like every day? report when/if starts going lower I'm uncivil asking customers wear maks? literally mt job   Okay real talk, would better jumping gun using whatever top vaccine showing promising signs recovery? Clearly people listening anymore Op confused *everybody*

common occurrence inflated ego It’s like pandemics cause lot death compared pandemics throughout course history compared global wars all. talking someone another human house since February seen friends person 2x since start this, socially distanced outside. used get together friends multiple times week pandemic, choice, antisocial pandemic.

People still getting weekly monthly support government. CERB ended people government bunch new relief benefits. 

For example get Covid get $1,000 2 weeks work. Canada Recovery Sickness Benefit (CRSB).

You get $500 per week caregiving. schools daycares closed need stay home causes miss 50% work get Canada Recovery Caregiving Benefit (CRCB). also applies caring someone sick requires quarantine high risk.

We also Canada Recovery Benefit (CRB) can't work due Covid lost 50% work get $500 week.

I think got all. also tons benefits normal non-covid related. think issue this. think things next year, it’s easier comply now. told decades (which means forever practice), what’s point waiting? One might well take chances little risk trick treating? Where's risk? Honestly asking. They'll outside DC schools going partially person 9th unless something changes. DC isnt spiking, starting creep bit sure feel this. 

Also considering cities cases exploding, feel Dem vs Rep thing much anymore. 1st Amendment: ya aint first yer last IT!! ‘MERICA!!! 💥 🦅 🇺🇸 abnormal sick people suddenly collapse heading somewhere, especially early days body knows disease really does?

If test people going hospital symptoms get much higher rates test school kids randomly 

Unfortunately best large sampling sewer system crappy data 😀 guess kids would likely give parents catch Yes Covid pandemic conspiracy cover an.... extraordinarily bad influenza pandemic. 

Galaxy brained take. Less whatever fish higher chain, though. every big US city manage pay people stay home 3 months? people seem bizarre idea Aus NZ people locking free. US government everyone $1200 check first lockdown, that's barely enough last month, let alone lenght Melbourne lockdown. Wife found Amazon. Good hunting! Haha, could be. I’m pretty sure guy thought president 9/11. guess could give begrudging pass someone super young, guy looked 50s. Best year dress bubble boy/girl. No, that's lockdown skeptics echo chamber feels like. Everyone else recognizes goal stopping brand new, currently third leading cause death.

I'm sure people would could month lockdown end traffic fatalities, cancer forever too. saw seatbelts, people like, ""sure, makes sense"" loud group solvent huffers refusing coming nonsense conspiracies them. China planning ultimate world dominance.  Put trial. Ever notice states cities Midwest native French names, almost natives French left? America totally morally superior genocidal nations, though. Somehow. Man that’s good testing.

We best testing. Spike proteins trigger production specialized antibodies, not? positive guy getting downvoted. love reddit  US never lock never will. none stater US Oh wow thread controversial... born later 1983, asking It’s pretty clear that’s happening idiot No. 7% tests administered returned positive result. 1. Correlation **not** equal causation.

2. Epileptic seizures triggered many things nothing.

3. people epilepsy, seizure induced shot. Every person different. irresponsible broadly apply outcome two patients patients. 

4. whole point vaccine prevent strong passing virus can't get shot. broadly vaccinate, get benefit herd immunity. 

In short, find new doctor follows CDC guidelines gut feelings. much better off. oh definitely, we’ve able find one two 250ml bottles 70%, since like march. i’ll check tech store instead pharmacy, cheat system anything? must something wrong going outside maybe 4 times since March.. Wow, would enough live lot people. know would work here. Luckily things like live NC. Things actually great here. personally know bunch people got covid months ago luckily completely fine. even show symptoms. lost taste bit weird. crazy business better ever has. business booming crazy thought would opposite. Crazy happened. able buy 2nd vacation house finally lol.

Whats even crazier could get new house cheap. housing market booming here. kinds people buying new houses insane. shows people really good. definitely sellers market. go take look something like Zillow site. Check North Carolina US. Houses selling like less week. crazy things started boom time like this. honestly thought would opposite. People great. Maybe got lucky live great place. Things running like normal awhile now. really hope stays same. see lot places completely locked places shit (talking US here). Look California New York. Thank God like there. People California flocking Texan right now. I'm glad live place locked good. People wearing masks fine. Good thing government forcing us stay in.

It would bad live long. Hell, make way week giving month. would hard forced live that. expenses way business would definitely struggle. I'm sorry go that. true people know around got covid, luckily hardly affected them. know it, whole company tested. I'm glad government take care us let us take care ourselves. here. mindset noone needs hold hand. things great now. take care myself. learn go life. I'm guessing places government thinks people smart enough, strong enough, take care themselves. sad government thinks people like this. maybe people think able government act like parent citizens children. doubt people think though. probably mostly government.  hand, men also conspiracy groups social media far know... US well prepared. W Obama actually signed ""pandemic playbook"", would tackle exactly kind situation. Fauci competent doctor leader. 

It's went perfect storm incompetent reality TV star president, itself, symptom deeply rooted problems inequality race, combusted lifetime pandemic.

A lot lackadaisical approach A) president denied it, even got didnt care, B) lot us cannot really leave work matter financial life death, decent social safety nets say, Canada Europe C) political polarization everything, including virus curbing policies-as either conspiracy move left power grabbing move right.

I sad tbh. better this. oH numBER 1 /s Fuck Ya that's they're trying say, pay attention virus really exist? That's they're portray Hahaha old you? New Zealand far less neoliberal British friend sister dropped airport. tells due Islamic immigrants. really amazing stupid Brits are, although guess hint based Brexit. heart tell him, freaking slag, nation drunkards morons can't wear masks can't stay bars pubs. think provoking Positivity rate percentage positive tests. 5% tests positive testing enough people likely missing asymptomatic positives going work spreading virus. That's bull. Deaths follow cases pattern - increase gradually weeks months fact come spikes.  said tested almost 1 million people already positive rate 1-2%. felt safe testing shopping groceries capital city. Australia NZ's success fit theory? Replying right covid unit wearing reused n95 mask months old. shit sucks. parents also joked around get life insurance lol 2016 y'all turned right shoulda turned left. What? went work Friday people normally wear masks wearing them. one guy on. Yes, Friday, yesterday...

People either exceedingly stupid ever could imagined people collectively decided stop taking news whatsoever.

Either way, there's still long road ahead euphemism for, we're fucked. mean per capita Europe right now. Everywhere hitting second wave hard right now. America never decreased like Europe did. That’s says estimates. France really scary 5 times smaller population compared US. whole EU much worse US actually. #Avoid trumper's like plague are.. Imagine bad World War death toll would've Woodrow Wilson pretended war exist Europeans inflating death toll money. first step properly fighting enemy acknowledging existence. Yes lots articles realise people fatigued comply rules less less time goes on, case point somebody ""already back normal"".

 can't see virus still firm grasp atleast socially mid next year, likely we'd vaccine distribution everyone throws window understandable right. 

My argument original comment use common sense attend super spreader events, especially level covid roof. friends yes, contacts yes, whats damage going big parties mega events things clearer? life milestones achieved properly next year. What’s suggestion? 🤣Username checks out. succeeding Aus NZ? wonder number Election Day hmmm I'm sorry hear this. know helps not, try take one day time. Well thanks smartass tone words wisdom. 

No think anything....I observe.
What observe continued pattern promises directly correspond stock market channeling monies tune trillions false promises. operate hope care it. children blind religious do. try look situations complete objectivity letting ego get way fog vision.

The rush ""vaccines"" seems dubious. politicisation looks suspicious timing elections. 

Everyone rightfully hating big pharma years many good reasons past performances.

Now savior along crooked politicians....are kidding me?

Politicians big corporations love use PR marketing sway masses. Mostly full shit profit minded only.

Anyone ever owned business explain business make money....not bullshit idea altruism hero.  that's employed corporation feel good PR bullshit make people like business. flu less contagious things prevent spread covid also work flu. since covid contagious, isn’t enough. mean, i’m scientist believe consensus doctors agreed upon therapy keeps alive, “hail mary” you’re really bad. earlier guesswork?

again, IANAD dont quote thing...because that’s immune system works. College biology live Denver, Colorado, USA hit 2200 cases yesterday state 5.8 million people. estimate least one every 200 people currently infectious.

But people still browsing grocery stores masks expose noses, visiting friends without masks.

There's lot people really stupid really selfish. going get lot worse gets better here. Well I've lost bet guess... along thousands scientists experts. country paying millions people working deliver food round clock everyday, it’s countrywide outbreak even welfare labor rights fanatic Europe can’t afford spend like this, would spring, PPE also needed wages, it’s simply unaffordable counties can’t ask work free. it’s lawful force people stay home, get overturned immediately. allowing people protest like that, shut order done west. 

If use wildfire example, compare event 100% death rate, starvation, lockdown prevents people working, eventually people still starving, let’s lockdown people starving enough people produce good, enough money even get food. virus 0.3% death rate, comparison flu covid, wildfire covid, wildfire comparison compared starvation. Lockdown causes starvation, far dangerous harmful everyone.

Also wildfire run away, don’t lockdown. fire burn could burnt, stopped eventually, that’s California deals wildfires, mostly ignore tell people run away houses, lockdown useless 3 scenarios, fires, starvation covid. ends publican Well, least ones could persuaded wear masks. refuse ""muh freedom"" much difficult reason with. decades hit harder SARS.

Why people Canada (Toronto area, especially) start wearing masks SARS? Canada one worst effected countries SARS.  I've never seen trump say anything racist. Everything I've seen taken context spun people make look like racist. completely manufactured. See that’d probably true variation cases 23k test 40k tests wasn’t negligible. Early week Ontario testing always low, there’s mandatory testing done. week progresses, tests jump 40-42k cases don’t jump proportionate amount. Mostly lot extra testing isn’t actual demand tests, it’s mandatory testing. There’s countries provinces testing Ontario per capita, specifically % positivity outlook Na, enjoyed irony calling people Karens.

Also, kind weird move delete comments keep replying lol country born individualism personal freedom. That’s collectivism akin communism. can’t alter taught raised since 1776 overnight. Japan's worst Philippines? part West, also part Asia too, unique little corner world.

The full article great (as non EU/US lol) find way read Hawaii serious economic problems even without virus. really really bad still economically . don’t agree should’ve kicked door open tourists they’re fucked matter conservative friends board trump called hoax.

I listening podcast host talked doctor North Dakota says initially everyone wore mask good hygiene social distancing, politicized. I've read document closely before. you?

It says ""Everyone right standard living adequate health well-being family"" -- guarantee live government-supplied housing, example. fact indigent people denied access mean must enjoy standard things.

And generally, world large likes bandy document around really follow says. read Article 2, must agree person anywhere, living in, say, Spain ""entitled rights freedoms set forth Declaration"". Declaration believed, Americans simply travel Europe enjoy ""adequate standard living"" however long takes treat cancer. Right?

Wrong. Declaration pretty obviously aspirational, something countries actually carry out. good set goals. guarantee require states force doctors treat patients world bound U.S.'s insanity contempt human life. toxic fundamentalist free market extremism, destroying human life, entire planet.""

This, argument with. Deaths remain “low” hospital icu beds fill capacity. full start picking gets bed doesn’t. deaths rise. Yes, “Beleifs”are dangerous accepting something concede complicated think rationally. “Believe” thing obvious visuals cues tell one thing, society/family/loved ones need ignore senses fit in. Hell yes!!!  (in literal sense) Media one part it, deeper problem West, stopped valuing education, expertise skill, allowed culture anti-intellectualism stupidity take hold grow, like cancer, edged politicians run ""experts"". comes cost. dumb jock bumbling buffoon like Boris Johnson likeable endearing, embarrassing - people given cultural capital allowed make important decisions.

My impression East Asian societies place much higher premium educated, appreciate coming Soviet family perceived education paramount. Growing up, occur go graduate school, children grow without parents reading books them. blew mind Canada visit friend's houses *no books* \- seemed alien weird. That's always case. ""the lockdowns (Minnesota), masses went shopping like crazy, toilet paper non-existent, limits grocery products, 5-9 day wait Insta-cart deliveries."" Anyone else else invited party get-together declined feeling salty about? love downvotes smooth brains scared little discipline sacrifice lockdown. stands efficacy vaccine collapse near fun larping University? I'm also Missoula scary me. understand many cases linked university, course stop spreading larger community students might less likely die seems like many lifetime problems recover. think public health officials done good job communicating risks young people face there's still perception old people problem. Missoula stricter guidelines state released guideline changes recently I'm afraid see happens holiday today. hope see Missoula completely shut bars seems large part too, health department already shut dive bars we're flagrantly disregarding guidelines. lockdowns strict.

It 112 days 5km perimeter something like that? Haven’t seen myriad articles saying remdesivir doesn’t work ? Lmao, can't breathe Okay, say that's true. 


How make combating virus different? wearing mask plays right NWO's hands! Hey least right wing acknowledges exists. 

It's still debate ours. That’s true doesn’t change fact deaths largely function total infections. infections continue double every 2 weeks deaths also continue double every 2 weeks. 

This hospitals become full point death rate massively increase people would survive hospital care would die Exactly, I’m truly ashamed country handled it. guarantee it’s due fact government scared say Tory voters. China actually high rate community spread outside Wuhan. rest country locked weeks testing mask manufacturing ramped up, Wuhan locked months Well, feel end economic aspects prevail sentiment ideology.

If true West (talking human rights ""values"" vs making business Saudi Arabia example), see Asian countries increase ties biggest economy made less okay pandemic.

It's trend past decades, see reasons anchor countries Chinese economic success, rather diminish middle another recession decade. Europe really, I'd expect common work towards BRI near future, less. There’s zero chance India hasn’t exceeded well 100,000 cases, doesn’t make US less fucked. hold belief India Europe May. first wave subsiding there. knows, could wrong. problem don’t 900 cases. Ontario 40k tests yesterday. That’s way low. You’re catching LOT cases. Thanks showing us looks like critical thinking skills intelligence toddler. Kamala said protests happening across country. Joe supported never said hey corona maybe right now. people unreal fallacies democrats pure without error  stage Fall Surge, risk it. that's me. want stay healthy holidays remember catching bug Dec yrs back miserable 3 4 weeks.

At point really individual decide risk factors whether push severe illness. blue-collar worker may want cautious since recovering covid physically draining able work home behind comfy desk. gotta say, pretty fucking true blue government least knows take plague seriously. goes goes goes Who, himself, COVID. Lmao. Dude totally missed point paper linked. looked random cities found ones didn’t rallies didn’t see significant bump, like Seattle.

You know pretty much every major city months? Protests. So, it’s automatic control. Additionally protestors wore masks practiced distancing outside. Trump’s rallies mask requirements frequently held inside. civil war, think higher level protests combined various state/local/LEO non enforcement.

That suggest prepare. Uncle sam going spoon-feed you. Counterpoint (but Devil's Advocate) - Christianity Manichaean, sexually repressive view world. Even ignoring Torah passages captivated medieval audiences, New Testament Passages counteracted beautiful message Beatitudes... Let everyone subject governing authorities, authority except God established

So completely sympathize identification nearly Christians false Christians, idk fully jives spirit Christianity. going spam something, least try understand first.  wait pandemic, we'd prefer exposed. dense you.

Okay, nowhere US high enough immunity make hospital overload impossible. Nowhere. There's literally data anywhere suggests do.

Second, Florida hospitals exceed capacity several areas, dozens hospitals ran space. Three field hospitals erected Florida help deal overflow. current surge worse time happened, quite possible Florida suffer catastrophic overflow medical services. Florida restrictions know it. restrictions part helped Florida avoid complete catastrophic overflow before.  

You seem grasp actually working actually happened like lockdowns. doubt. question is, know hiding second wave? hand, yeah, big lockdown could killed virus. I’ve gotta say, don’t agree. Workers members public absolutely excuse can’t socially distance, practice hand washing techniques, wear mask whenever around others. reason people don’t government isn’t strict, public stereotypically stubborn. key worker literally excuse right time. pandemic truly opened eyes intolerant country change, I’m becoming ashamed Brit. Fyi, mountainous panhandle part Maryland, squished PA WV....

What far typical handled well, kids sent home infect family, extended family, class mates, etc... deaths disabilities result. every story like this, I've seen dozens (weddings, restaurants, bars, church gatherings, biker rallies, political rallies, government meetings, work spaces, schools, etc...) after-the-fact reports describing lack care protection taken subsequent spread disease. already wet food markets almost certainly horrible idea done away with.

Agreed. think factory farming also done away with. There's scientific evidence points right ingredients towards potential deadly pandemic originate factory farm.

Additionally, denial climate change result immediate removal person public office.

But nah. America it’s cool watch world burn. Well, really absolutely nothing, could short months. Source? 
Florida getting worse last three weeks relaxed.

Hard use someone getting worse example recovering taken volunteer deliver food people’s houses lockdowns, that’s super tough work, one west work free much workload.

First, no, delivering food super tough work.

Second, pay them. would demand work free? ridiculous conditions make know lockdown eradicate virus, lockdowns ever done

So know nothing lockdowns done.

If house burning hope saved, fire department waste water it? wildfire prone areas, dense neighborhoods, etc, absolutely.

Why waste? preventing spreading getting worse.

You going start seeing means spread control U.S. health care systems start collapsing. already airlifting patients hospitals try balance load run worst stupid macron, knows lockdown don’t eradicate virus curve spike reopen, still went ahead political show. 

Another concept totally ignorant of...

The point get cases manageable level building testing treatment capacity. many cases cannot managed, fewer can. proven several countries. problem people stupid shut like wearing masks, going eat, show idiots don’t understand basic statistics science trying something.

Pot meet kettle. Meanwhile US head sand. I’m educator understand sentiment. disagree. Remindme! 1 week mention protesters masks too, interesting article. people outside Reddit idea daily numbers way organised Man, set Man actually risk getting ill it. would really daft plan. COVID response less Hollywood blockbuster quality.

So therefore assume aliens. IE: coverup.

Basically, whatever Emergency Management System supposed place would ideally place there. That's shock. Also, governments trying pandemic cheap. real conspiracy money. That's what's scary. 

Ask schools open? Taxation. schools open reason justify large taxation (in Western economies least). Yup replied wrong person. risk lost generation restrict education anymore. Online learning young children work. European model, whereby participation dependant agreed set standards protecting rights, health freedom individuals slow growing, remain formidable force humans decide forego rights. whatever perspective look world from, people currently seeking achieve rights, way. pandemic certainly highlighting challenges dealing strong minded, independent, yes, even border crazy ignorant population, prioritising personal freedom group safety. laws written since lawful states created. hopeful European model continue thrive crisis, time participants well beyond old European borders, call something else entirely! shit clickbait. super scared ones home consuming much news possible. They’re targeted market advertisers fearful headline better. 

Rational people exercising moderation living life aren’t constantly refreshing internet news Hi American definitely good news - especially regarding billing. 

But serious note, thank you’re - truly - stay safe there. Facebook can’t legally held accountable users say platform due various legal protections. Ummm that’s still great number... parents crying summer long.  


""Dont close schools, please dont close schools. cant handle Kids. take Corona please, cant handle kids own. Please dont close schools."" June 28. That's wrote that. 

And today. Yeah, imagine everyone gets exposed corona declined turns smart choice. 

Statistically number Halloween party’s way, maybe one invited to, maybe. It’s actually pretty cool job. it’s recession-proof!  above. It’s becoming clear countries “beat” tight lockdowns and/or extremely swift robust test/trace response. Tawain Japan I’ll put asterisk next don’t know enough response. 

I’m sorry, argue want page “wearing masks” “social distancing” judging US Eu/Uk, governments telling citizens “behave”, laissez faire government response situation...clearly winning strategy. 

Should 365million US citizens social distance universally wear masks? SURE! ever reasonable expectation would? NO! Except infections far widespread death toll predictions even higher. :(

Scientists warning us bad fall winter seasons might get since February, sooner. What’s baffling come India’s numbers coming almost everything lockdown including gyms restaurants. Lmao that’s funniest metaphor I’ve heard pandemic it’s true Even plausible scenario 85% mask use, model still projecting several weeks 2k deaths day.
 
 
Wild. post replied talking innovation, reply China's supply chain? qualifies opinion? Let’s protests spitting face law enforcement again, ask nicely enforce mask laws lol Originalism, theory constitutional interpretation, little w/ random archaic laws happen still exist various states. Theres speaking people. entire world view manufactured. Despite stereotypical rugged larrikin image, Australians generally quite conformist. Shame worked pretty well Melbourne.

Deep know lucky here, &amp; mostly ok locking down- given isolation made (virtual) eradication actual possibility. we've achieved (touch wood lol).

This concept would feel reach countries land borders infected nations, would imagine. Especially poor Canadians, neighbour 'land free' (to wear mask) Ah wait minute, silly me. EXACTLY I’m saying lol! That’s funny. Wiping medical bills everyone would best Christmas present ever. yet - yet what? Let ask something, know good idea go bar pandemic? Well know internet, right? Maybe TV. understand basically there's dangerous virus goign bar spread it. know this? Trust me, smart enough come - info comes scientists, doctors, specialists, on. Well, conspiracy theorists get info exact way you, simply lucky enough taught critical thinking example, lucky enough sensible friend tells otherwise, lucky enough targeted invasive emotionally blackmailing political ads/propaganda daily basis. used think similar terms - rocket science know things - actually, rocket science, especially common people doctors scientists live day-to-day basis. Especially given conspiracy theories operate - they're attractive make individuals feel empowered. countries still cases, COVID need eradicated country suppress successfully. kids got go camp none actually got ill real degree. Glad got fun enjoy summer

Much like kids Vietnam, except kids Vietnam kill parents. Oh boy What?

Florida twice amount new covid cases yesterday New York did. making shit up. Hell, Florida new cases yesterday California. capital, 40 minutes waiting time, felt safe people kept distance. must follow great leader. shared secret combat virus! 

We 350k cases per day US Christmas. spend Christmas locked watching protests around country set cities fire. Around time second virus released population - “quiet virus” makes humans sterile. Operation population control = success. There, better? Hey want try order N95 masks work send you. I'm healthcare worker I'm like 2nd line worker job still supply us order. us use cloth masks anyway. probably easiest example short timeframe looking at, best example climate change effect growing population world. point humanity screwed earth point probably late fix problem. Decades mostly apathetic responses come back get us eventually. trailer also completely ripped ""I Legend"" using ""Three Little Birds"" Yes Many countries let guard prematurely.
How even possible pandemic?. regardless, lockdown, flood hospital continue spread, lockdown give hospital chance catch up. 
There course 2 big pieces puzzle.
1. Vaccine effective.
2. Cooperation. ? God help us all

I'm sure new covid/Trump orphanages stimulate shit economy though. Non-essential shops hospitality close month, sources told unlike restrictions spring, schools colleges allowed stay comes documents suggested UK course much higher death toll first wave. Coz parents ready kill end first lockdown. That's confirmed cases. There's way unconfirmed. likely 10% US population infected point. Everyone negative PCR test coming, guess figured false negative? 

It's pretty likely really one person brought in. COVID entered chat.
The flu entered chat. hope right. write another comment btw case want read it. Womp womp strict measures containment NYC. number would gone tremendously little action done. Don’t forget one biggest missteps: Pay people stay home hazard pay essential workers. Pretty sure China headed re-education camp spouting Christian propaganda like Merry Christmas! They're, uh, religious. know what's upsetting? I'm NP saw writing wall Wuhan physicians reported first cases. stocked cleaning supplies January. I've damn diligent work - multiple at-work exposures never led anything, probably obsessive behaviors mask wearing, hand washing, care fomites, etc. family cloistered since March aside husband go work (he desk job WFH May).
Now crap control get COVID me. get workplace demanded in-work days rapidly blew office leading multiple positive cases. husband positive symptoms week ago. 

Now I'm starting develop symptoms.

I just... looking Clorox wipes stations bottles hand sanitizer, surgical N95 masks going ""What fuck for, anyway?"" agree disagree..I know anyone calls White House politician advice sick danger sick. Common sense tells call medical professional. submission mean “giving up”, case wasn’t clear. again, quick perusal post history makes regret taking bait. middle Europe, way eredicate virus.
This slow down. Oh oops forgot Philippines, although I’m sure level restrictions. decline Europe sure, think actually started WW1. also think America picking slack Europe regards global dominance around ~1995, started decline. Asia catching since might come top 2020 like 76 subtle lol.

They took precautions, required negative PCR test 7 days self-quarantine attending. nice example need sophisticated policies allow 76 people gather, precautions not. debunked you... like said can't even use simple logic.

the end: ""Eloi Eloi lama sabachthani?"" Gotta number 1 everything 😂 fuck Trump GOP. quite point since Asian people still small gatherings restrictions reflect that. point Asian people, outside family gatherings, used crowds home. Even young people, might 1-2 friends that's it. heard theory many places locking try prevent riots election Tuesday. Might also Trudeau insists Canadian border remains closed even though situation much better. Can't flee Canada election! I'm worried. I'm looking shitshow around world get surprised lack pandemic China. going ad personam? Good thing keeping schools open though -- kids definitely identified superspreaders anywhere else. /s UN?? What’s next? Little green guys Mars? stupid be? 😖 state position instead showing example argument, make insults. Yes, people victims system puts shit brains everyday basis. ""Ordinary"" humans animals big brains, often can't control instincts impulses. That's created governments safe other. governments failing us big time. 🤦🏽‍♂️ catch crabs figuratively? 

You either lower traps bait ocean big crabs sleep wrong person pubic lice kind. add 3 carry 1. it’s not. Yeah you’re fearmongering sub Reddit, it’ll seem way. yet show I’m putting anyone risk. point comical acting like lockdown means everybody's going run food even though lockdowns happen. 

You ventured well bad science doomsday conspiracy theory crap.

You also completely misunderstood purpose wildfire analogy. people running fire, taking measures prevent spread something dangerous maintain manageable level resources hand. realize leaders saying vaccine coming many, many, many months now... personally, based I’ve reading scientists, we’re long time away.

The trials US poor people Africa going well. inside source recruits people to... handle things there. Proved what? Lol literally debunk scripture. drink milk!

&amp;#x200B;

The Real Reason Dairy Industry Adds Vitamin [National Institute Health Office Dietary (NIH), recommended daily intake vitamin [600 International Units people ages 1 79. one 3-oz. piece salmon contains whopping 447 IUs, people don’t generally eat salmon every day ― particularly young kids. One cup milk [can contain 205 isn’t much vitamin fish per serving, it’s easier get hands on. effective: NIH reports “fortification milk vitamin beginning 1930s made rickets rare disease United States.” Nobody cares title aren’t never will, even restrictions New York New Jersey sees far bigger spike Florida now, Florida shut allow people getting immunity, that’s exactly well compared others shut down, simple that. It’s panic porn, you’re idiot doesn’t know read things internet without panicking yourself. mask mandates socially distancing proposing? say need “go back normal,” virus here. That’s normal. 220k Americans died COVID-19, 1k day still are. That’s normal. ask you, anti-maskers opposed socially distancing: what’s plan? think ignore virus go back normal, hospitals won’t overfill? death rates won’t rise way higher now? economy won’t suffer worse already is? Fair point. Taiwan SK numbers low. Also, AU SK well-managed second wave. Also tight lockdowns? Social developmental impact children. It’s easy decision, mental/social/developmental health overlooked. 80/20 rule. 

The 20% dumbest among us well-represented top Trump admin. We've got share nutters anti-mask &amp; anti lockdown Australia, &lt;5%.

Poor (sensible) yanks much higher ratio 'freedom' loving fruitcakes contend with. could never win. We've one yes, second lockdown? little based stolen, Western intellectual property.

Too bad a) stealing scheme dominate world, b) successful determined. bad stealing way population control Africa's way things.

We dishwasher color TV promised kitchen debates. oil drive SUV. presented electric cars energy-saving bulbs, fight that. accept LED shiny, accepting mask fight pandemic we-never-did-that-before. long hospitals rooms... thought too, math, figured even 100,000 cases per day, would take little 8 years spread everyone. Even things got really bad hit 1,000,000 cases per day, would still take another year. that’s jumped 1mil/a day tomorrow. I’d rather count vaccine. Thursday Aww touch nerve? seem love oppressive regimes long people oppressing look like you. right: read article instead complaining TL;DR. I'll read app. Yeah! We're #1! 

Thanks ~~Obama~~ Trump!

^/s Americans great people certainly brainless.

Don't lie yourself. ~40% voters certainly are.

But guess something American shifting responsibilities, right? Aus/NZ thingy linked well written article [other nice read ( article mean) Also, entire population get virus order attain herd immunity. formula (R\_0 - 1) / R\_0. R\_0 (basic reproduction number) COVID 3, need 2/3, 67%, population needs immunity quelch spread. even overestimate R\_0 presumes population that's completely naive virus absence public health measures. yeah considering listed defeating covid accomplishment think fucked worrying China homeland crisis? Right, according slavery U.S. opportunity escape.

And forced labor forced threatening cut arm work.

And kids forced work water breathing plastic tubes philipine mining gold forced labor, parents beat working, get killed.

You sick twisted view world. say quit work?  said make plan take care kids. It’s one else’s responsibility hint male volunteers happy, greet them, thank them, tell awesome. little, feel much better knowing people gratitude despite exhausted. Say Biden, least common sense wear mask social distance. Hey buddy.. Nobody wants facts involve everyone locking homes 0 covid cases. C'mon man, get program. Little evidence that's much risk leading indicator,"" Inchausti said. ""The proof poop.""

This high point career. also idolizing Nazis. Guess spoke lot much hated Jews didn’t actually anything it? Cough, okay. Good luck Slovakia!🇸🇮 We're making 🌲 case graph. Gonna decorate with... bodies? rolling end date like Oz nz has. numbers aren’t low enough open back 2nd December? It’s opening early screwed uk last time. need nanny state stopped acting like children question mark sure that's is? makes sense. 

Yeah I'll take chance that. Seems better countless people sick minimum 6 months covid-19, potentially life. I'm sure we'll little days long haul covid vaccine time. zero great dying covid-19 parents grandparents higher risk sure. long term effects subsided people 6 months. Young healthy people. LOL. Sweden fine all. current situation despite citizens' response threat curtailing public activities without government lockdowns. direct result citizen's showing responsibility general public. That's mentality US citizens response this.

Even Sweden's public health administrators admit that.

And yes, advocate accepting death people deemed justifiable (old sick) order avoid constraints, inconveniences challenges life style. semen jump overboard die.

You need keep claims straight dude. contradictions. attempt enforce would painted fascism. UN perfect fascist foil it’s orchestrating centralizing one controlling world government also incapable isn’t worth treating seriously. time cases anyone reinfected twice 3 month period, beyond documented cases individuals catching twice monumentally low (something like handful people millions), baseline conclusion sick generally enough antibodies protect getting reinfected again. strains mutate could change we'll wind seasons look like flu, time strain copies still looking comfortably similar original strains. this, vaccines candidates also coming higher expected efficacy, around 75-80%. Nothing stop us getting 1 million, National mask mandate may stop us getting 2 million We've civil partnerships dude, even marriage lol. linking Canadian article hawaii. "" lots people Hawaii asymptomatic simply climate latitude."" lol, talking about. Quite anecdotal though. Schools course whatever prevent spread anyway. Smart man! &amp;#x200B;

All vaccines candidates tested fail meet clinical endpoints. (I've written posts)

There successful Covid vaccine, least within reasonable time horizon. Certainly year, next year, even year that. vaccine eventually emerge, marginal efficacy. know real moral quandary it? slightly modified case trolley problem.

Of course condone violence, could shoot bunch superspreaders act ends saving people long run, would worth strictly lives saved perspective.

the real solution get people stop selfish realize end result collective irresponsibility, easier said done societies collectivism seen hostile. time, including new measures, UK closed borders international arrivals. long promise stay hotel room private residence 2 weeks anyone come here.

This one aspect “response” completely mystifies me. Didnt say Christmas like two days ago? slaves could escaped canada, slaves, choosing inhumane labor, right kanye?

Why want NGO's dedicated helping forced laborers stop helping forced laborers gun point? home March June son became socially awkward sometimes even little aggressive kids 

+1 learned it’s always late government acts makes decisions. Fiction comes Thursday. much warning want? England yes. Since sept Wales. dates think yes devolved areas this? Idea is, get 30% ineffective people streets. 
From testing 3 critical regions last weekend, new cases dropped 120 12. (per region). global testing, worth it. 
If works, prefer global lock-down. Man people like you, anything life nothing? Rarely ever. Old news! Thank heads-up. feeing probably aren’t discuss facts. :( No, slavery US slavery tried leave get killed. Derp  live here...no one know one knows someone know gotten since April. RIP already non-existent dating life That's still responsible enabling irresponsible behavior.  Somewhere 8% 17% apparently: Lots people spoke slavery owned slaves.

WW1 moving frontlines (unlike WW2) quite safe non frontline personnel still remember statement bunch public health workers put back June said anti-lockdown protests major contributor spread (and ""rooted white supremacy"" supposedly), much larger BLM protests weren't, somehow.

News flash, virus give rat's ass cause protesting for. Masks help panacea. 100,000 people still 100,000 people. big protests okay cause agree cause agree with, nothing pandemic pure politics. 36.6?? hell elected guy leader? gave little warning would lockdown again. panic buyers buying toilet paper again. Weak country. school districts remote supplying chrome books? school districts loans every year. PBS great documentary last spring following 3 families poverty trying survive economic downturn. 3 families laptops (not sure owned supplied school district) kids remote learn. don’t know people want regarding “enforcing masks distancing”. places mask mandates? stores require masks? good mask mandate do? small town government isn’t enforcing current mandates isn’t going immediately start enforcing them.

Do people want police break small gatherings? people want mask mandate???? methods? Certainly lockdowns. Clearly typo. retarded you? Oh. need answer. Maybe mom laid alcohol pregnant. Death rate still reported keeps declining. isn’t news. Well, thought neat 😷 Parts US level impoverished. real. shocking. absolutely real. moron. 😆 Uhhh that's problem. countries well take people countries failing. evidence kids big driver virus? Sorry, mortality rates never ever high. You’re saying 1 4 people died got numbers don’t match up.

Unless speaking certain types hospitalizations like going ICU ventilators? another ways organize school everyone mill time area. Staggered start break times, mixing classes, kids alternate online person school etc. person school increasing contacts 20 people. 20 people every day. No....? I’m saying 9/11 coronavirus two different things. Which.... are. agreed point made it’s inexcusable. 

Gotta read all, short comment. paraphrase I've seen posted before, mommy daddy need babysitters employers' CEOs buy 5th yacht.  real reason governments pushing schools re-open. stinks. America, fuck yeah! lockdown Ireland left schools open. 400 cases today 1200 couple weeks ago. 400 probably outlier we're probably 700 region. Lmao... can't fucking spell. moron. obviously simple stuff countries manage it. assume hope hinges common older generation family members one household children like countries. friend lives grandmother young brother attending school would concern them. .....but everyone WORKS Sturgis is. 

&amp;#x200B;

it certainly help.

by now, they're 4-5th generation spread.

the people came places experiencing spikes now.. 

you literally see coming going.

**VIDEO: Data company tracks traffic 2020 Sturgis Motorcycle Loser Yeah, everybody gets it. Covid terrible deadly pandemic, lockdowns needed, except ""an extremely important cause"". mass gatherings totally acceptable. get it. Well done, correct fact states holding information school infections tells everything need know.

Wouldn’t nice leadership could articulate, motivate, possibly inspire teachers want continue teach person despite pandemic, instead hiding shadows?

Wouldn’t nice leadership monetarily rewards it’s teachers essential workers sacrifice saving economy? way late follow now. plan assumes start following beginning outbreak. think Hillary Clinton would followed though. probably even Jeb Bush Marco Rubio. Would followed letter? Maybe not, believe would completely ignored way Trump did.

If Biden wins probably late much time takes office. virus misinformation leaders widespread. 

But president leads example, constantly lie it, think we're much testing certainly can't hurt. would plans expand surveillance testing nationwide places like nursing homes, CDC issue science based guidance, push Congress paid sick leave. Dropping temperatures big part it. are. could due kinds different variables though- necessarily vitamin ancestors fought died prevent level tyranny , r.i.p great britain mini lockdown expected announced Monday night entailing (1) travel regions (2) closure shops non essential stores (3) stricter lockdown measures Milan Naples, two hardest hit cities. Lmao mornon NZ 6 flu cases detected testing ~ 500 die flu. lockdown helped manage flu facts, spread covid, care feelings. understand getting downvoted. implying lockdown good idea, right? Yeah that’s frustration comes one wear mask still. I’m Vegas plenty idiots traveling Utah youth sports “everything open one wears mask”. Let sink Utah open Vegas. speak place at. ventilation really good, windows open, one spend lot time inside. see next week go again. Since almost everyone get vaccine, sub-set fact suddenly die serious illness it. 

Do think thing happens Covid all? El Paso already near 100% capacity hospital beds, terrible definition safety theater. Nah everywhere shut people break social rules home anyway main places spread unis colleges schools still open Yeah 25 minute video multiple people costumes safely spend Halloween kids. Obviously super easy cut 10 second clip make look bad, context appropriate. 100% tone deaf, intentions good. said before, read paper. insistence holding discussion place ignorance instead educating entirely uncalled making far shittier needs be. least tell reading quotes providing...

Wilful ignorance serves one.

How service enslaved people bought, sold, moved around rights indentured laborers go home families night home?

If cared, would care ***why*** distinction made. Instead virtue signaling upset corrected. Freedom right, earn rights. honestly need stop umming ahing. People getting fed up! waited nearly 2 hours shown bunch projection graphs data contradicted said, slide briefly shown accidentally full hour came talk, somebody BBC knew coming beforehand... clincher Boris rambled 5 minutes telling us already knew would happening. Total waste time. Yes, China's handling virus example world. deadly virus part Soros' Gates socialist depopulation program ALSO hyped everyone wears mask sheople can't think wait ask...both can't true! Yes topsy turvy world right wing insanity.

It's strange. kinds ideas.

Just like people might think Covid kind test God, others might think natural virus like always happens, yet others might think specifically over-crowding ""modern life"".

All cant true time. ancestors fought died prevent tyranny going UK right Try Texas, students path 6th-grade-level test order graduate.  start first semester 9th grade every student gets dozen attempts pass it, including session held summer end senior year.  


Failure rates many districts high classes end teaching test instead mandated material classes.  school managed get quarter population declared special ed would exempt statistics, still help enough.


Fortunately advanced classes managed mostly avoid dealing stupidity, rest kids time high school loose world 'adults' 25 years now, many grandkids going cycle. aren’t African American death rates higher? That's happening nation wide. part schools want stay open enrollment purposes ($$$$$). Basically long one tests positive campus activities, say see cases. quarantine 10/14 days let back campus. total fucking sham.

&amp;#x200B;

This notion schools drive pandemic totally bullshit. widely testing schools all. happened China, rate infection deaths, much rural country, government's inability get things done assumption made week first however think government would nothing, also expect intercept PPE deliveries spread propaganda downplaying also expect giant portion country become anti-maskers still large hard predict upcoming election winter coming (meaning people inside time open guess baseline now...500k dead, trump gets re-elected probably 2 million+


I meant based expertise....who estimate anything subject? Again, can't force anyone anything unless them. Simple concept. hard understand. Stop normalizing defending slavery using outdated definitions. know else that? South changing slavery ""indentured servitude."" secrets nothing compared Trump's tax returns, cant wait tie together banks. issues get need, like ps5 limited stock. think stuff like toilet paper plenty warehouse supply chain.

Its people trying empty shelfs one shop thats problem. goods may shortage like sanitiser due mass produced product. majority items available, people issue supply.

If people shoped normally dont think would problem. anyone know variant D614G one not? According following 4 reports strain binds readily ace2 receptors Spike protein mutation infectious strain

Spike mutation pipeline reveals emergence transmissible form SARS-CoV-2 | bioRxiv

New covid variant 3-10 times better getting cell before

SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein variant D614G increases infectivity retains sensitivity antibodies target receptor binding domain | bioRxiv

Spike mutation D614G

D614G Second wave 10x infectious Yikes man, freedumbs? /s concept herd immunity literally came measles. that's actually worse possible example use. Well half country’s going break rules anyway little enforcement main places spread uni schools colleges still open don’t see point it’s going reduce rate enough month worth Catching crabs (pubic lice) euphemism, figurative language. dont need police enforce. Yanking business license bar sorts funding rights business ownership. Even stayed open banks stop g business maintain current license. work represents analysis largest sample date SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences patients one metropolitan region United States.

Fascinating write-up. Pretty callous attitude. Glad aren’t making decisions healthcare. saying they'll allow people ignore order keep restaurants pubs open?

Because are, bad news you... saved link I'm afraid. managed delay getting infected 9 months. managed buy time research understanding novel virus progress. if, God forbid, things happen take turn worse health, better treatment protocols higher chance surviving recovering March/April. Good you. Stay safe get well soon! Schools back session, ""normal"" life comes back work vacation tourism. start Thursday... 

There's chance England's streets full idiots partying next days, expect spike cases 2-3 weeks time, pretty much guarantees position end lockdown 4 weeks. regard, where? US? F  USA, hold corona mother infected, stepfather. aunt died it. Well certain lot less babies born right now, mean need bring immigration make that. also prefer this. They're still going school online. They're eliminating school lol smart play actually bide time wait energy die like 2008-2010. McConnell knows he's doing, soon Trump loses he'll lay low tell rest GOP party cause problems. reported major source recent outbreaks linked small gatherings friends family. Masks seem much they're worn people think safe hang friends family.

Even fans celebrating Lakers' win likely helped spread virus Los Angeles. Dodgers' World Series win another worry. mean Premier League? Children germ incubators, it’s futile nationwide lockdown allowing still attend school. concept social distancing schools whole year group ‘bubble’. read like apartment, one virus vacancy cells would leave alone

I laughed wrong sub politics. friend Halloween party tonight, republican friends well shipbuilding industry. We've tell no, coming least 4 times many days. stopping people gathering. view people deliberately evil, dumb. anti-mask point arent dumb, know facts, willingly chose ignore thus potentially kill people cause alternative would cause slight inconvenience.

&amp;#x200B;

Anti-mask crowds willing potentially kill large numbers people inconvenience minor way. , literally evil. arent , evil meaningless term. think people avoid label implications, think dangerous call evil evil. ways adress stupidity evil different Lol pandemic think people Christmas gatherings? Ok mate. Stay home, unless going work, school, university, hospital appointments, exercise, shopping, takeaway food list goes on. 

Not really lockdown lads Ahhhh thanks sounds like answer send poor kids back school, let kids remote in. Somehow think would get completely torn apart proposed. Pepperidge Farm remembers. Surely lockdown metric. imagine North Korea never locked down. best country ever?

I know US really care non-productive members society like elderly poor, pretty cold. large (rinsed/cleaned) yogurt sour cream tub, recycle after. Press mouth genital area contain splashing point case? Sounds like US stay home order paper Either good avoiding think are, virus spread determined non-behavioral issues like cells, making efforts useless.

You’re welcome. saying worse comparison knucklehead countries. Gonna see Thanksgiving. Christmas New Years then... idea answer can't let poor suffer rich pay way it. yet accused buying conspiracies took one nutters task. people want save. Others far gone.  Peer reviewed accepted. Stop trying overstate things. I'm made money Belgium’s yesterday equivalent 680,000 new US cases. Everyone reasonable mind knew horseshit April. feel like would confusing people living lol one forces anyone pay taxes, sorry. optional. 

They key word forced labor forced. Meaning choice. Forced labor slavery can't get past dated views definitions slavery never end. part problem. Unfortunately according reports comments daily recent months, vast regions US following public health guidelines, quite likely see plenty “twindemic” 😣 cannot tell trying imply public health officials incompetent want read report, sum you.

Kids showed 2nd, kid question started showing symptoms next day. 11 close contacts quarantined 4-7th. tested positive 5th, remained quarantine. 11 kids tested 7th, released back general camp population. period 4 students started showing symptoms, isolated rather given masks. people started showing symptoms, second positive test, camp notified WDHS 15th, point disease already widespread. WDHS investigation contact tracing, point kids parents already tested positive quarantine. New symptoms continued appearing 15th 20th, health dept organized tests whole camp 28th. kids released two weeks later.

The investigation contact tracing done WDHS, CDC. report published peer review, purpose outbreak containment (as already) dissemination information. clear limitations report page 3, mostly caused timeline above.

TLDR: CDC investigation, rather state health officials, notified 12 days symptoms 10 days first positive test. people needed know knew long time ago, 60 days CDC write publish report rest world. Deal, throw whole white ethnostste thing I’m board currently estimated 100,000 cases per day (source 7 day average deaths 237. Even allowing lag deaths would looking 1 million cases per day support 4000 deaths. pretty absurd country 68 million people - 4% would catch day - every day percentage would likely immune would climbing rapidly. Thought government covering costs failed? Thankfully got plenty year. Used avoid sun due skin cancer family history. anymore, never again. Id rather get cancer skin illness everywhere else. least skin visual checks regularly catch early. anything goes wrong inside, option. never listen mainstream drivel passes good dermatological advice society. First 4pm, 5pm, 6pm finally, 6.45 aired. 

We knew time England games month ago.... US hit 100k new cases yesterday, Europe hit 300k new cases yesterday. 

Jesus. Ok, what's answer? saying people poor afford technology internet(assuming provided), discrimination send back person learning, solution, right? cynic, certainly heaven-sent many state-run pensions. FFS, **this WHO**. put IFR 0.6%. Ionnidis funded journal. He's trying downplay things beginning. Stop lying people. Should’ve shut everything start. Back August, Melbourne UK similar figures (when adjusted population). UK complacent, Melbourne enacted strict lockdown measures lifted couple days ago. recorded 11 cases past 7 days, none last 2. Okay, like.. chance fact true, trying depopulate world.. want prevent that? crazy? many places pandemic hospitals surpass breaking point? Conspiracy theory nuts think there's global conspiracy get rid borders create ""New World Order"" single government entity controls entire world. They've somehow latched onto idea mask wearing things tipping point suddenly George Soros Bill Gates named President World. pretty funny stuff. exponential growth happening nearly every state us right saying they’re telling us wear masks fun? much sense would make? that’s choose interpret it, I’m fine that. I’m trying steer people away people like actively promoting (or case, probably selling) fake/crappy masks may get family members killed. School option childcare one people think about. Authoritarianism works well pandemic, time spent pandemic..........not much. ru tired yet 100% agree - currently estimated 100,000 cases per day (source 7 day average deaths 237. Even allowing lag deaths would looking 1 million cases per day support 4000 deaths. pretty absurd country 68 million people - 4% would catch day - every day percentage would likely immune would climbing rapidly. Can’t weave morality tale specific group people doesn’t include (Republicans/schoolchildren/college students/suburban moms/boomers/restaurant goers/ravers/etc.) blame it’s determined seasons, though...    know estimate means? never claimed expert anything. right jumping borders, right panic buying / hoarding, right lot shit. honestly think I'd right casualty number government federal mask mandate.

These simply predictions knowing enough human nature.

Thats P100 full face respirator years worth 2-ply long started flying shelves.

I knew shit stay China broke right Chinese new year. knew bad leaked videos people dropping dead hospitals street corners Wuhan poster said burning massive amounts bodies.

I knew would hit major coastal cities hardest. LA, SF, NYC. knew would spread rapidly high population density watching spread China rapidly.

I knew PPE would short supply knew going pandemic based fast spread.

I knew people would panic buy food, toilet paper, cleaning supplies people idiots. stocked day first confirmed US case.

My estimate number casualties 100k - 200k fits line population slow bureaucratic roll-out policies.

I thought we'd either federally mandated shutdown across board / federally mandated mask policy across board month 2 became unavoidable acknowledge problem. wrong federal government anything. I'm thinking 500k March, possibility slowing spread Biden elected 2 million+ next 4 years trump re-elected.

That's factoring we're cusp civil war right now. think real possibility...which I'm stocking ammo Monday vote Tuesday.

My estimates me. prepare based them.

If I'm camping feel sudden palpable drop temperature, I'd prepare rain bring stuff inside tent. wind direction varies throughout day I'd expect frontal shift either get blankets, prepare bonfire.

Reasonably prepare worst hope best...but can't think. go Parliament, think, going start next Wednesday midnight. imagine lot people living pubs restaurants then. Lol plan place whether family members babysitter/nanny. happens kid sick? send school anyway work?  two possible solutions problem, yet anyone says send school quit work. Easy, thought answers. ok forcing teachers schools work to? people elect government. Surround like minded people get asses moving getting right kind people elected. impact see changes made local level. worry, go away Nov 4

/s America numbuh' 1# risk kids' futures mental health massively outweighs chance reducing R rate slightly closing schools every subject things repeated. learned facts pilgrims Revolutionary War Social Studies less 6 years row. lot wasted time school. Science pretty much 3rd 6th grade. Maybe advanced things added much middle HS. semi lockdown like Germany. Wait 10 years UK legalise civil partnerships opposite sex couples. Get booked well advance 1st June, 10 year anniversary. First lockdown, date gets pushed back December 1st 15 guests. 
 
It directly mentioned tonight's long winded announcement worse PowerPoint presentation ever(and colourblindness unfriendly) I'm fairly sure I'm rearranging civil partnership yet again. Yaaay. right, I'll take words here. sign factual evidence potential cover up? emotional distress expressed ass fueled Western mass media/anti-Chinese propaganda?

To day, seen **anyone** ""ChYnA LIeD1!"" argument making *any* single rational analysis cover would entail, would possibly happened.

In fact, looked facts Chinese ""cover up"", reduce possible timeframe could happened (from whole January according Western media, days late December), point realized active cover make sense all:

* China warn world, maybe? Nope. evidence extremely early, including notification [on December 41 pneumonia weird cases only, know White House warned [by January (see Alex Azar 1h03), thanks Chinese CDC. happened first confirmed linked death happened January 11 too.
* Cover silencing Li Wenliang? Nope. [Li Wenliang never narrative pushed Western media. Also summoned *after* notification.
* Maybe hid growing cases? Nope. paper reputable [New England Journal indicates otherwise. Look [Figure shows Chinese response cases weird pneumonia started increase scientific procedures SARS protocol indeed followed.
* Maybe want share sequenced genome scientific community, since released quite (relatively) ""late"" January 11? Nope! true genome sequenced earlier (on January 5), indeed sent [US NIH genome Chinese experts (with help Australian colleagues) made public another channel because... [the NIH freaking slow publish it, exactly? cover happen? research done allow push allegation?
Show us simply spurt information directly butt without thinking.

Because see, *anybody* half brain tiny bit research beyond spurted Western mass media propaganda come (un)easy conclusion: blaming China attempt distract governments failed response crisis.

There HBO original, historic failure cover US administration. enjoy it, maybe. really shocked this. similar developments France. Why? They’re reached “Thoughts Prayers Level 5”! apt description sleeping habits. thank heehehe Unfortunately lot anti-lockdown supporters amongst govt ministers &amp; MP's &amp; voices carry weight publics opinion What's reasonable nonsense? Temperature checks almost nothing considering contagious covid-19 presymtomatic people. 

Yes, already know lockdowns last resort spread can’t contained public/community mitigation alone. Lockdowns never first/only option — [they’re effective layered community mitigation (limiting nonessential businesses, masks, distance, hygiene, limiting social group idgits still wear masks neck warmers (if wear all) still can’t bothered cover mouths cough/sneeze. Half-measures we’re predicament. Dang, that’s valuable data. Thanks link. They're paying 80% wages staff, unfortunately large amount people enough, especially family parents get furloughed

My wife works pub furlough rejected something company new (idk fully tbh). almost half income cut, whilst bills remained tact, somehow expected afford all. furlough scheme definitely helps, many enough Holy frogs. might highest positivity rate I've seen far. Meanwhile NYPD relative posting facebook government can't tell can/can't home... global evil villainous organisation hell bent depopulation better engineer virus like H1N1 case? (as kills younger people) No, fuck off. Iowa's high 30s last week so. ridiculous . stats bullshit everyone knows it. remember reading several articles China couple months ago ""0 new cases"" country 1 billion? Yeah that's bullshit. way 0 new cases testing, can't cases test see right? Can't new covid deaths report due covid, right? first time Chinese government lied either, in-fact notorious trying cover up. Yes. There's going time going safe enough people like admit safe enough go back. vaccine comes people find 50% effective still want lockdowns, wear masks, socially distance. strict rule, general mutations tend favor increased contagiousness lower death rates, way around. viruses cannot spread kill hosts. Remember viruses, unlike organisms like bacteria, can't survive reproduce own. guy gets it. lot people learn happened them, unfortunately. Ten bucks says people believed thing 1918 influenza pandemic. UK: Following government briefing discussing another lockdown, else honestly agrees school safest place children why?

What thoughts teaching staff too, cared properly? There's ton. There's temporary decreases air pollution carbon emissions caused decreased economic activity, particularly around March. there's reason hope spur research better antivirals better treatments post-viral syndromes, currently sadly areas weakness humanities medical knowledge. mRNA vaccines work holds promise developing vaccines lot currently neglected tropical diseases. general pandemics sort things meaningful pro cons.  Restaurants bad right actually. least Canada, there's empty social distance buffer table, put mask anywhere table. Bars parties though, fuck em. give 1-2 weeks say shutting aswell. got negative for? Masks also help slow spread flu. 

Not wearing mask means get diseases.

 Weird. thing stupid fucks believe truth.   Nowhere hard Melbourne’s (which indeed total lockdown). Schools uni still open. L-dopa gave brief respite catatonia relapsed. seems Reddit shut ins really understand reality. would love whole world lockdown month eradicate thing reality would *never* work. Certain activities, like person school, risk outweigh benefits. either idiot blatantly paid operative. OP wrong here. Mayor shutdown, put place County Judge. kids stayed camp tested negative, spreading virus further, right? got number individuals much less likely part infection chain near future. NY getting bump despite hit hard pretty aggressive testing/tracing. even NY incline recommended protections place states even requiring masks going skyrocket. worth exactly? Top researchers saying going endemic, meaning going away. People sub completely disconnected touch. children spread lot *other* diseases well mean COVID-19. new virus different properties. Several countries' experts said seen much evidence children driving pandemic much. example said children may spread adults easily. professional league impacted lockdowns. Players constantly tested. make sense stop professional sports leagues. also great testing rate though. awesome seem well, I'd love get testing make sure. Prepare spend next two weeks researching actually can't do... again! Blabbering idiot. due respect, said wrong. county judge El Paso County made order, mayor City El Paso it. City El Paso Police Department mayor, El Paso County Sheriff's Department County Judge.

I feel like confusing non-Americans understand jurisdictions work United States. anyone link research talks advantages covid-19? either social economic whatever. I'm writing essay can't really find many sources. help appreciated, thanks advance. problem news articles subjects today's age. gross hyperbole get clicks headline normal people middle want facts accurate. projections based data analysis, probably depress people. deaths follow infections. takes weeks. hard comprehend? ignorant ignore cases infection cause death leads long-term health complications? Besides trauma burden friends family. health care workers. That’s good point. However seeing rising cases across age groups. hospitalisations vulnerable people exponentially increasing That's even reason preparing months now. People simply can't trusted right thing. going interesting end year. D?

Can assume mean vitamin vitamin D3? fact majority people asymptomatic virus doesn’t affect makes response seem overblown. 

For example, read article 23 members sorority tested positive. Then, stated one members actually symptoms, symptoms minor. So, consider hysteria response overall derailment life due virus which, case, 22 people asymptomatic one person minor symptoms, don’t realize articles like could cause question whether pandemic overblown? There’s fucking hayride going street right parents going door door kids. funny countries avoiding lockdown want affect economy much.

But countries done lockdowns successful stopped spread covid within weeks economy continue normal.

A weeks hampered economy vs 10+ months volatile one. Sounds like commonly refer ‘cock womble’ Nah, WISH 8 months ago. really good chance 100s, heck 1,000s, even 10,000s cases.

But yea, Trump great job. Nobody else better. - people still supporting turd Reported misinformation. GLOBALISTS here. take vitamin daily October April people can’t manage wear mask killing people. depopulating agent. Think asked Ready punch outside Tesco 4 pack andrex. really. America country puts religion fairy tales science. easier believe mystical figure loves worries you, doctors epidemiologists scientists. say party full black people.. they'll shut shit quick. learned democracy really best form government tackle covid19. /s ""Wear mask situations cant socially diatance"" mantra since started. he's 100% lying ass point.

I'd sit beer garden fucking gale meant spend 24 hours day dad's living room again. change scenery.

Trump betting won’t need shutdown, we’ll see works couple weeks  “Some businesses” “in theory” “should” wrong people! think people spend 20% income commute work? It’s propaganda, live lol. don’t listen anyone, go look infection numbers. Math doesn’t lie says we’re particularly stupid effectively handling pandemic. Extroverts Wat Tyler raise again! Oh know it, they've saying since September Christmas menu. Dunno think they're fooling saying allow us normal Christmas... ignore guy lmfao. US already whining probably two weeks behind Europe. whining increasing states add restrictions again. General strike. course not. shocked government let die though. Seems like would helped starvation issues Lol: China handled COVID best powerful counties.  Shutdown one city going harm big industries meaningful way. Agree never say long lockdown last beforehand. get extended every two weeks. crowded close proximity absolutely true Yeah, totally. Ordering people go get tested (for free) whole hospital system collapse number covid positive people requiring medical care starts increase...... seriously, dare try FORCE get tested keep hospital going save lives!! oh audacity.... Totally ageee, it’s almost exactly like Hitler did. Totally. 100%. Same. Uhm. That's precisely lockdown Latest updates regarding Florida &amp; Texas: worries, chuckle 😄 Fun fun fun think could disagree more. warm weather equals outside getting things lockdown. cold stuck inside kids winter play places visit, museums, movies, malls. Winter lockdown far far worse, especially kids. irony ending argument insignificant life... day? US ever saw 1,200/day highest many times larger pop

Sure virus ravaging every single state. localized phenomenon. like Europe whining lol inbound travel affected ?  Good points way one event, people outside city want believe virus exists. fucking moron again. watch China watch US much larger sample size geographic distribution. I’ll take florida day matter many cases have. Weather good. It’s nice comfy 78 breeze today Halloween sorry, mixed up. fixed now.... 10000% pro science, thus pro lockdown

Those two equivalent, please see linked scientific papers border closures, full lockdowns, wide-spread testing associated COVID-19 mortality per million predicted March 2020 response covid-19 broad lockdown, opposed focus shielding vulnerable members society, would reduce immediate demand ICU beds cost deaths long term. optimal strategy saving lives covid-19 epidemic different anticipated influenza epidemic different mortality age large study using data several European countries – still preprint stage – suggests lockdowns, regardless restrictive are, visible effect trajectory pandemic. Another pre‐printed study Hunter, Colón‐González, Brainard, Rushton p. 2) reports:       found closure education facilities, prohibiting mass gatherings closure nonessential businesses associated reduced incidence whereas stay home orders, closure non‐businesses requiring wearing facemasks coverings public associated independent additional impact.  provisional publication status two studies noted, 100 comments study *medRxiv*, none taken authors task either methodology, findings conclusions. Yes, States easier say dollars find key combo pounds lol Next conspiracy theory: Vitamin turn pedophile Bill Gates paying Hilary Obama add Milk Bread. accurate representation government handling this. probably discussing whether close educational establishments. vote would yes that. I'm 99% sure passed around.

I pubs, restaurants etc week girlfriend since opened, felt safe. They're want get shut found source small outbreak.

Schools however literally breeding ground stuff. look quickly nits pass round entire primary school.

My take gov since levels started rising again, process elimination. They're trying work main places infections spreading. last step eyes - they've closed everything schools, prove theory. numbers start go massively lockdown. bet end next week see numbers drop slightly, week kids off. They'll keep going Christmas break, close schools. 

I totally understand they're closing schools, I'm it. that's needs done, happen unfortunately.

They've fucked everything else though!

This opinion, makes sense head. Good point, sorry hear family friend Yes. got two weeks ago idea. one contact tested positive. clue got even though wear mask. guarantee people walking around symptoms spreading without clue. found needed get tested procedure. indeed strange virus affects everyone differently. Thats rules here. live alone 'bubble' one household, otherwise cannot meet anyone indoors out.

What weather terrible, runs walks etc much less appealing, lockdown going grim. sensible compassionate way create endemic virus put lockdown hit retirement rest life vaccine. guy fucking joke... holy shit!really.I didnt even realize that!My apologise Yeah combination. 25K cases day, track trace impossible keep without restrictions.

So tell  trust say Dr. Fauci ?  direct contact person COVID (and thinking COVID) hours. tested positive two days later. test 7 days later negative also whole time symptoms... pretty strange maybe luck... fool, least tell satire reality.  president continually promotes nonsensical RW conspiracies, lies every single day life death matters... truth longer discerned ordinary people. intentional. thought Utah already bat-shit crazy. Florida definitely unwell. think everyone wants that, dont vaccine soon also manage logistics extremely well, likely see restrictions getting lifted around spring-sommer 2021 anyways. media’s fault, Tidying Marie Kondo would censored. Maybe UK. sure US. mention 140k active cases? Let go outside thirty degrees get mediocre amount rays. coronolympics. would suggest online school. yeah, sorry forgot write way know protests got on, people pissed (that issue, mishandling pandemic, scandals) ruling party liked right Well said, good luck post history 99% satire, original comment. falling says me. idea wipe small business large mega-chains left Kinda, although Britain, hospitals always massive strain winter whereas summer naturally capacity. Additionally, become bit bituminous deficient. saying fault, obviously there's bigger picture contributed catching it. worth trying figure people catch it, especially ""I everything could"" folks, people learn try avoid whatever hole was. know, that's support wearing masks lockdown?????

My area tougher restrictions since July. need things, like working track trace system actual mask usage (not nose 30 mins supermarket). that, can't normal life. US, chant ""CCP virus"" 30 times daily. make virus disappear. Brits guys try that. works. It’s time! Shame can’t go hard New Zealand though get top seen Belgian news today. Lock starts midnight everyone went shopping today. go comes down. Stores happy 3 times normal sales real distancing dickface masks. test, contact trace shut things locally. It’s strategy least try. lockup else be? Well, even elites necessary case.

All need control people look nutcases *should* ignored cater tell right. migrate beliefs agenda easily enough. difficult get political acceptance measures US. may seen news, militia men (right-wing anti-government extremists) recently tried kidnap Michigan's governor, simply mask order, Trump way condemned. Well then, understanding simply incorrect. Guess don’t know meaning temporary. means, feel free go &amp; enjoy life we’ll see well works you. 
Every single person around didn’t take virus seriously caught it, ending hospital &amp; one dying (35 yo zero health issues). hobbies, wedding &amp; holidays seem quite insignificant you’re lying hospital bed &amp; loved ones can’t even visit you. couldn’t stay home couple fucking months. Milk Toast rescue. Umkay, K. mention prisons, burning criminal populations like wildfire. blame you. worth living bad hotspot point. Right here's problem, historically, US tougher approval form medications European standards generally lax US. Basically yes one contact tested positive.

That's thing. Someone contact infected, test positive. love Monday Morning quarterback articles really mean nothing--Italy's huge death toll Spring could've avoided too, likewise Sweden's high death rate Spring could avoided also, look Sweden's neighbors(Finland, Norway, Denmark) death rates, much much lower--and Belgium highest death rate world, Festivals February? BoJo LoDo comes back Long drawn lockdowns cause untold damage tho.

You mean pretending like lockdown, really half-assed, lame job instead, causing lots issues already mention, getting corona top good measure. submission removed because

This everything going shit end day shit bipartisan. entire Democratic Party outside Bernie Sanders spent better part year pandemic arguing even rudimentary social safety nets bad. Then, midst pandemic, Joe Biden says single-payer healthcare system wouldn’t make things better America because, quote, “Italy single-payer look bad things there.” mean, holy fuck.

Now something said absolute illiteracy electorate refuses hold idiocy like task, end day unapologetic career anti-welfare/anti-government spending crusader clear away best option going. 

And case thought might change tune welfare midst world-shattering pandemic...he tweeted month “American people aren’t looking handout”. 

For every shithead refuses wear mask suburbanite can’t wait tune politics things go “back normal” Biden. So, always, us bottom ladder get absolutely rogered bourgeoisie go back brunch. Anti-lockdown people welcome protest wearing masks. know hate Trump nothing change Make don’t make invincible. numbers would also lot higher. 

Plus due students moving halls. mass migration 18-25 year olds, living together masks. 

You think masks alone mean Covid isn’t big deal?  Shows scripture says Jesus God
Because 
Imma post again
Because can't read. 

Lmao also debunking I'm saying? Oh wait lost facts. 
Yeap John 3:16 states god gave begotten son, whosoever believes may life eternal. Therefore atheists atheists believe God. however convert believe saved. 
And son *is* Jesus thing Son God. created like us. Please look back link sent earlier talks Son God means Jesus came world understand. He's creation he's divine origins. He's God. 
I've also said given scriptures showed Jesus saying God Lord God referred Lord. 
I'm going reply anymore know lost can't debunk anything say. can't even take post point point debunk it. 
Because I've presented evidence clear day. believe it.
I said opposite scriptures posted lol. literally explained are. issues cannot comprehend this? I'm confused. 
Anyhow, goodbye, hope find Jesus pray believe saved ^_^ tysm debate! months prepare second wave worst first RemindMe! 75 days Oh wow even worse. 
At least idiots re-brainwashed.

An entire nation people stubborn mule. 

Wow. realize they're trying conservative gets, right? ""If says this, automatically happen!"" FOH. island, strategy eradication, strict testing anyone coming in.

Given extent infection present population, China style lockdown (not version gone for) lasting least 6 weeks, thing work. could done months ago, back March. 

As Lecter said, ' half measures curse it' People seem give shit. number people know going eat every night keeps going up. Stay fuck home stop hanging crowded places mask. Exponential growth real. bad many Americans “I’ll never need math life” camp. ""distress defence"" meant things like people get panic attacks autistic people and/or carers (some autistic children get distressed cannot see carers face carer would exempt). I'm sure people abusing I've personally observed Finally someone sees ""CoViD KiLls""

Of course optimal would shut world year put everything stand still that's works. I'd inclined say kids dont take well online learning. Especially elementary students. Extroverts. Adhd. learning disabilities. Kids struggling never catch fully this. still exponential 15% week. One week 100 cases. next week 115 cases. 15% 100, 15% 115. Instead 15 cases, 17.5 next week. Then, goes there. Haha expected to? Hard believe, honestly. say moment, well done Melbourne! done well getting covid cases down, rest us states hated it. I’d probably say people aged 18-30... sounds right

but getting downvoted strange announce evening Halloween. I've already heard multiple people say they're going big one tonight lockdown. United Kingdom..... go school ? know 2019 people stuff? It'd shit last year like now. assholes, president, atmosphere. Even 1918 different anti-maskers.  forget students excluded Schools aren’t shut therefore shitstorm vaccine. It’s bonkers rise cases hasn’t established millions going back education. Stop don’t bother. potentially immune case suppression tactics uneven access testing. guess would work case load threshold based detection limit. We'll following suit lock soon, calling now. Meanwhile I'm happy bricks coming back silence administration Pretty much. 

And flu contagious Covid. obviously amount precaution, numbers go down. point contradictory fuck Europe something like won't. Yet say, screw that, get shit on. whole sub one contradiction another.  Little update I'm hospital getting oxygen,and taking intensive care also pneumonia E-xac-tly. numbers game. many people infected, even seriously ill small fraction, number still large enough overwhelm hospitals. think lot people realise thin margins many hospitals run on. Every winter struggle.

Let's pretend hospital hospital COVID area. emergency department sees, normally, 190 (a good day) 240 (a bad day) patients day. serves population 250,000 people. Imagine tiny percentage - 50 extra patients, 0.02% population - turn ED one day. would catastrophic us. would pull staff sick relief areas. Wait times would balloon hideously - imagine appendicitis heart attack wait 4 hours seen? something less deadly likely happen - fall fracture arm. would feel waiting 6-8 hours fixed?

Now imagine goes days, weeks, months. Staff burn out. get dragged areas. Wards get shut turned COVID areas. means elective surgeries cancelled, investigations delayed, people chronic diseases cancers get treatments often.

Imagine much quickly happens 10% positive rate. Say 10% people sick enough go hospital. much bigger 1% 0.02%? trouble keeping job reach someone. plenty help depression drug addiction. Even need talk someone, please reach out. Good luck dude. give up. UK? £10000 fine caught universities need rents, Tories never give money institutions produce intelligent (read: non-Tory) voters. mean comment sound condescending? I'm assuming worded badly. Starting get really fed paying price people's selfishness. I'm young healthy, exactly type could get away blaise. locked away months see things one way now. sending kids back school insane, right?

Also flu deaths almost disappeared, masks work flu covid? Schrodinger's Virus - simultaneously following: hoax, totally harmless nefarious plot China, Gates boogyman choice hurt certain politician, country target.

i relative says hoax, flu bro, plot hurt mr t, cursed staters killing people bringing germs! Oh already 2 years ago he's immune!!! plus revealed he's racist visiting even i'm longer worried giving covid he's anti-mask. wtf happened Czechia last two months?These numbers staggering 10 million country. think numbers worldwide, US. mantra isn’t working though. Basically still go work employer requires youre considered essential worker,children going school usual unless youre self isolating bubble 6 people live household meeting 6 people different households self isolating permitted unless meeting open air public space,gyms &amp; movie theatres remain open &amp; pubs remain open aslong theyre serving alcohol 10pm unless youre eating ""Substantial meal""(No chip cobs count even cheese on).
Or something.

You go out.

To conclude fucking idea hell doing. agree it’d nice know, thanks widespread failure public policy that’s literally going *impossible* lot us. speculate wonder made mistake somewhere, isn’t way actually know. long enough time span, even vigilant slip up. We'll already vaccinated.. joke massive amount americans live paycheque paycheque, government provided way safe would serious issues  furlough scheme ended. replaced something else although think something else beneficial workers first headline many. feel point USA prime example happens don’t balance. kids I'm outta school I'm right you... feel like sending kids schools short sided. 

The problem lot people plan lives around kids school work. kids can't go school, minimum wage worker do? Daycare incredibly expensive feasible. Bring kids work? Leave kids home unsupervised?

If governments society took virus shit seriously, would shut everything provide relief everyone. Full stop. problem though lot people proved could never ever follow quarantine unless absolute powers like China, going happen. Hell, USA, people actively spreading it.

End day, governments provide half measures slow things down, people die hopefully lot, people keep jobs kids school. added bonus selfish people world showing are. No, one takes seriously. live Liverpool Street station London streets rammed, whole handling covid joke Natural disease propagated ideologues exact. There's blame go around UN lmao first seven months year, sales high-potency vitamin C products already double amount sold whole last year. 
 
Lol Tell families whose teenage kids 20-30 year olds who’ve fucking died. It’s tiny margin, fucking research bruh. God mean shit ignorant infuriating Maybe bolsonaro get again.... want get high, they'll storm lock cage Imagine dumb  Nope, isn’t 

Keep schools open 30k cases per day, contact tracing FUBAR. smartphone app total failure. can't find everyone. personnel. Opening schools error: Example: one positive student, quarantine classmates teachers. Fact is, teachers least 10 classrooms besides one infected. entire school risk. Classmates go families. go afternoon, meet people form schools. impossible stop rate. still specific data this, like new infections caught schools, cannot accurately analyze phenomenon yet. Hope new restrictions start take effect slowing curve. Stay safe. mention half america obese. Obese people tend lower vitamin levels. Women going menopause well, people like chronic pancreatitis malnourished struggle fat soluble vitamins. worry It'll gone Easter I'm sure follow science.  hope America pays attention calls shame boyfriend even didn’t ever catch course.

(But check eyesight) Cmon guys let’s go 200k! made open now? America First  Dude holy shit. What’s exact point you’re trying make? Like seriously 


So many people skeptical it, right? Yes? Cool. FDA putting tougher guidelines pass would ease lot worry. approve it, ton people’s minds ease taking it

What literal point post? UK passed 1 million look studies, less 10% excess deaths.. Ever heard critical thinking? He's Tory. fuck expect? submission removed because

Thanks. incentive spirometer? something measure asthmatics might one somewhere. felt hard breathe initially ok hour so. wonder psychological next time ask doctor it. take don’t kids :)

Warm weather way better stuff backyard. 

In winter, you’d usually want go indoor pool, museum, heck, even window shopping mall grabbing Cinnabon. Indoor entertainment whole ‘mother deal. There’s much coloring, board games, reading, TV, video games every day bouncing walls.

I’ve started mine burpees start flipping out. Torys general, right? Ignorant opinions like reason world fucked atm get logic outa Nick Offerman probably gonna 15 years sub anything say Well fucked up. Sweden proof. I'm fortunate position longer commute, started career spending £300-500 diesel month third income.

I'm saying 20% cut good, fully believe 100%. making observation sharing experience. country filled mentally ill religious zealots. People like point fingers middle eastern countries (and rightfully so), America really different. extremism considered culturally normal. first lockdown happened March! second one happened much earlier Lost sense smell 6 days it. symptom tired. felt like got tea cups Disneyland every time stood restrictions breeds new cases, choose deaths mild annoyance father four children, confirm schools petri dish best circumstances. Normally, get sick times year, issue since pulled kids school pandemic. Silver lining guess.  follows epicurve seasonal human coronaviruses, we'll 10k deaths day. Unless people ""self-lockdown"".

The problem is, base infectiousness virus make difficult effect people staying home bring R 1. Meanwhile, ton people social media feeds saying stuff like, ""Flu 98%... see what's going on?"" insinuating government counting flu COVID. Like, blown away many people know brains realize measures take prevent spread COVID also work prevent spread flu. Saying hi New Zealand too. locked everywhere fuck explain friend vitamin keeps bones decalcifying (losing calcium). children, low vitamin causes rickets, milk US fortified. adults, vitamin prevents bones breaking easily. especially important elderly, decline die hip fractures. Right. understanding herd immunity would take long time develop. interesting though cases dropping, would nice know too. Except fewer people caring playing rules feel like sham government something stupid make even worse Additionally, government support ended test stay home would compensate staying home. 
Food places open takeout 
It also impossible landlord evict you, bunch rules around accommodation managed stuff law well weeks actually terminate lease wanted move. got fixed pretty quickly. 
There basically 4 reasons leave home 
* Work 
* Exercise 
* Essential shopping (supermarket) 
* Visiting Doctor 
a 5km restriction travel also enacted. 
as /u/i_am_cool_ben said, large part public supportive (I heard high 70% points) would pay it. also stupid party own. Here's Trump rally. Latest government survey shows highest. find direct relationship people Russia targeted US UK acting directly opposite national interests. 

&amp;#x200B;

I mean, getting people spread virus voluntarily ""own migrants/libs/left"". I'm sure, home alone day short dark days fun. least warm could go outside walk nice. something killing people US. 

lol. don’t say. No, want day wife borders states much thing borders densely populated European nations. People really need stop peddling this. turns death hypothermia cures coronavirus. work facility provides housing education low income students. Pretty much mini college around 500 students. shut sent students home/to shelter. process trying open bring back students. thought quitting need health insurance. fucking screwed. I'm scared Got source that? ...Y entonces todos los compatriotes compatriotas compredieron el porque se le llama el dia delos muertos. todos se quedaron en casa vivieron Felice's para siempre. Hasta el siguiente jueves cuando korea del norte decide bombardear cancun cozumel en particular. Cozumel porque ayi vive el pinche de Carlin. Ese cabron nadir lo quiere, su virus. Chingate Carlin, antes de que kin jun un se enoje. Andale guey! virus contained least government tried keep cases US, contact tracing would really easy do, case could easily tracked, maybe people would know got virus from. Honestly keep home homeschool possible. Health comes school. Biden absolutely power end January. next ~3 months Trump worst. Here’s archive link[archive link anyone trouble accessing article fucking kidding me? Romania phones blasting alarms infection rate 1.5-3 patients per 1000 citizens. guys 20/1000 thought locking ?!?! WTF wrong government, mates? think given individual within risk tolerance, absolutely, especially 60.

If me, would going bars playing pickup basketball right going Halloween party.

It’s societal level though. Vaccine put hospitals won’t get overwhelmed really think. not. using definition shown numerous compulsory labour shall mean work service exacted person menace penalty said person offered voluntarily (ILO 
Convention No. 29, art. 2.1)4

I actually speak forced labor regularly [hobby subs interest according definition threatened jail, bodily harm, harm family count forced labor slavery. 

Unlike think forced laborers suffering deserve recognized international community.

Why desperate say forced labor ok unless threat death? thought came soon game finished, know Boris [is passionate I've got news - traffic rules also take away ""freedom"" drive however please give safety killed road.

You must traffic rules well. Vote. presidential congressional elections also local ones. way avoid stupidity gaining power preemptive. Schrödinger's Lockdown barely move stroke-ridden hands, who's pressing button tells rest chain command nuke itself? Using contact tracing US akin trying use duct tape keep Titanic sinking.

Contact tracing quarantining first line defense. course, US never really that. 

And that's lockdowns become necessary. essentially quarantine based upon mass presumptive positives. Lmaooo torrent really create ninth alt man lot states reimposing restrictions spread doesn’t get hand. big spike yes, people start put overwhelming pressure state governments start locking things weeks numbers fall. never said bad. 

Go back cracking whip wherever investments forced labor. bet aren’t talking like reality. single hospitalization triggered testing millions re-testing week later. never able unless postal service using deep cough+saliva tests. But, rapid response tests, lot people would divulge results. maybe would mailed sure. would mail everyone dozen tests ask mail back they've notified public health authorities conjunction quarantine wait results. I'm spit-balling here. cost would staggering, unless federal government mobilized production tests wartime production law. **This may seem extreme, transmission rate goes exponential**, experts speculated according news articles reddit posts, **it may way fight back**. people could volunteer pay 12-pack tests also contribute help pay test kits others patriotic mobilization, might able bring costs down. This. 


That said, winter great idea take supplement, especially COVID means staying inside even usual. Like rhinestone cowboyyyyah 8 months though ignoring eat one foot grave wont need treatment all? Schools going back session.

Seriously. keep schools online vaccine available everybody. immunocompromised essential, *everybody*. 

Which would likely cost us entirety 2020-21 school year, more, probably reason idea popular idea. hey, done that, could probably avoided huge surges. think proceed you’re clinically vulnerable however people made sacrifice children stay another family members house already established causative studies, small groups. Hopefully larger studies going now. surgery would want surgeon wearing surgical mask? sub made big bet school closures effective understand common sense points toward schools drivers pandemic. However, we're really true mantra ""listen science"" need understand actually clear cut gut feeling tells us. equate mask Unfortunately media giving picture Sweden disaster.

You one highest Covid death rates Europe think *media*? media killing eldery? linked video peer reviewed source CDC data like myself. even linked CDC getting .7% estimate proves overwhelming majority population, anywhere near .7%. .003%-..02% 50 .5% 50-69.

Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  Yeahhhh...no work get done. last lockdown streets empty, expect less come Thursday. data bears out. How's future mental health going look parents end hospital ? live Augsburg (Germany). local hospital said (a days ago) would run beds within 7 10 days unless numbers stop going up. able send patients moderate condition hospitals hopefully buy enough time so-called ""lockdown"" kicks (which basically shutdown restaurants bars, rule lists formal requirements social distancing difficult enforce).

So hope people stop car accidents, heart attacks, strokes etc. area knows well cared weeks. would lockdown involve? Army shoot sight? family wants us come Adirondacks Thanksgiving minute almost considered doing. brother talked phone like, ""That sounds like really irresponsible thing do."" exact reservations. think people something, fuck think ourselves? I'm positive never would gone it, goes show easy justify trying ""normal things"". I'm btw, relates comment. right us drag shit north.  hard time earlier year nothing currently ""horrifying"" ""up there"".

Apart onset winter, used that. That's feels like sometimes.

Keep seeing people socials snapchatting rip roaring halloween parties. Hundreds people, crushed together, grinding eachother. Bong hits, beer pong, people breathing eachother dark, closed house. college students either, people going 30s 30s. Pictures people passed drunk, vomiting place. 

People post ""amazing halloween year"".

My area lockdown cases day worst pandemic. Mask mandate. Everything's closed. 10 people gathering max. Cases climbing ever higher ever day.

But guess people enough want infect one another rest world?  never heard deadly disease eventually became less deadly everybody either died got antibodies. ever happened?

Plague. Though still isolated cases time time African nations get annual outbreaks. Could argue without encouragement many business would ruined Calm satan Trigger much? What’s solution? one searches reasons offended vs solutions. That's nice hear, site showing Irish stats...? mean NI SI ? Health dept said they're overwhelmed numbers call once. one's going kill millions forced laborers? 

You really need read write respond compulsory labour shall mean work service ***which exacted person menace penalty said person offered voluntarily***(ILO Convention No. 29, art. me, think happens refuse forced labor China? think happens refuse forced mining certain African countries? get killed.

Do think said *no* forced labor threat death? never said thing. Put straw man pretending done gun point. 

I never said anything sort. making shit cannot defend point labor real slavery. Again, time force someone anything them, slavery.

It sucks think forced labor forced unless threat death present. People like detriment society. whole lot people going whole lot suffering saying bad. Cognitive dissonance part it, also people contrarians - government/experts saying it, opposite probably true.

But fair, even simpler explanation - listen Alex Jones. since mentioned him, gotta plug [Knowledge \- brilliant podcast Im confused people would stock up? Food shops etc still open usual? background statistics &amp; spent weekend building bunch models.

Cases &amp; deaths don’t statistically significant correlation. someone engineer virus purpose depopulation, could prob better COVID-19.

It's got transmissibility down, delayed appearance symptoms allow spread easily. truly lethal - danger society lies primarily number people could become ill simultaneously. ""From 1 March 30 June 2020"".    
I'm glad hear talk [current 6 months maybe? shop restaurants print fake badge government website saying causes distress wear mask. According neoliberalism driving countries today need overflow beds cost. better cut minimum make larger profit stuff owners pockets. Forget medical workers, salaries low possible make profits.

Capitalism inherently unable deal pandemics, climate change, economic inequality on. works there's constant growth constant growth achieved masspollution, mass production material cheap goods countries workers paid 10 cents hour dire conditions, producing meat large factories, living resources on. turn excellent conditions pandemic arise in. pandemics happen, enough beds medical workers neoliberalism told us cutting welfare institutions implementing privatizations increased profits important. keeps happening value profits everything else life.

The next time go polls ask profits everything hold dear life worth it. Literally  was... whole Cummings stuff chance! 

100% this, Bojo shot foot refused hang Cummings dry, compliance going low people feel one rule another us 1000 people

Feel free move along, i'm losing interest upholding argument nothing. guns. bible, really care. also care carefully scrutinize prior words, also afforded courtesy. It’s already bad healthcare workers one exceptions comes quarantine rules want overwork us more, many profit-driven hospitals healthcare admin using COVID19 excuse squeeze us profits rolling back salaries benefits forcing us work longer hours (but obviously fully undoing changes situation gets better). area authority ""Prophet"" said nothing masks.

I’m georgia resident it’s ridiculous see quickly life got back normal here. hey, things aren’t terrible I’m cool it. Mine supported **your link**. CDC estimates 0.7% still answer question. state country managed keep widespread community transmission populations? can't suggestion already proven empirically impossible.

We 3 states hospitals struggling already. happens throw fuel fire mom dies appendicitis local hospital bed? argument monumentally fucking stupid dangerous. Stop pushing disinformation get people killed. laughing narrative That's works buddy, sorry. tell never sold bought realestate. signing check can't sell house, sale goes taxes paid. learned?

the tories abject shower shit Non essential shops going close little late, modus operandi. place rising cases maybe massive selfish twat instead?  could see argument one year online. longer damaging children, regardless number infections. false. SPEEDRUN [archive link anyone trouble accessing article shops public transport Tested positive today. I'm young healthy still kicking ass. safe people take seriously answer answer, exactly happen. got banned covid support disagreed mod. claim spreading misinformation.. proof covid spreading schools despite school teachers dying covid coincidentally shortly schools reopening. even said course theres definitive proof teachers kids definitely catching school vs outside school common sense says otherwise. Somehow doubt even would enough stop spreading kind misinformation.. turns covid spreading schools.
 Stop trying get people killed. Hospitals getting overwhelmed multiple states restrictions. youre asking would cause mass death people accidents non-covid emergencies well.

Again, **this WHO.** put IFR 0.6%. Ionnidis funded journal. He's trying downplay things beginning.

Stop fucking lying misrepresenting WHO's one's going kill millions forced laborers? Really? Tell me, think happens refuse forced labor China? think happens refuse forced mining certain African countries? get killed. Stop pretending done gun point. 

Forced labor real slavery. Again, time force someone anything them, slavery. excess death reads like attempt normalise exactly quote describing. 

If become numb casualties/distortions/lies... side won. Ok. discussion, ENTIRE thread isn’t “a couple months”. It’s notion years. feel like keep reverting back comment “cmon guys, it’s couple months” we’re explicitly talking happens extend long term endemic.

So I’ll ask clearly seem constantly avoid point:

*If* solution, working vaccine, treatments. think - viable solution always social distance rest life, mask wearing mandates forever (don’t dare leave house without one on!), children never class school freely play playground classmates, weddings, travel, office Christmas parties... large thanksgiving dinners, none it. think solution? accept higher rate mortality return life *if* find without working vaccine treatments. know commented already.

additionally

""the hospitals take much patients especially compared march. within week could heavily increase amounts beds. need keep beds empty/ready covid patients"" says CEO largest european hospital chain southern europe usually full influenza times, many years. crazy. nothing new

madrid 2015 italy U wot m8 Halloween, dead people part fun. government already rules come home. allowed harbor fugatives example. likely hard enough test many people without test little kids definitely want something nose deep. would cause much trouble need fast. complaining cases south there's lockdown... cases north also lockdown?

Can clarify get even shop workers reliably wearing masks. Sounds like 'intelligent' lockdown have/had Netherlands. sure really works honest. worked great first wave, since September lot changed we're back square one. everyone car grocery pickup like that. parents are, hello inheritance, fucking donkey brained justifications logic opening schools arent even based reality Exactly! even graduated university! Electric bugaboo Rugger on. sounds like actual hell supposed try Darwin Award Remember everyone losing minds China ""lying"" hiding numbers? Pushing innocent meat grinder, they're doing! Feeding machine benefit. people never left mother's womb. Let suckle ovaries, feast unborn brothers sisters like predatory lunatics are, stay fuck land living! It‘s maddening almost every European country seems put 7 year olds started school, high school students, college students basket. Yes, little kids remain school long possible, high school college students trouble whatsoever remote school. 'proceed you’re clinically vulnerable' advice gave stranger pandemic think see downside plan! makes sense. deadly age groups like 70+ people probably grandchildren now, deadly young people children? depopulation plan, really stupid one. Bojo trolling me, knows get ps5 preorder, wants sit inside staring PS4 rub in. Yeah let's fuck face rising infections deaths, alright government totally blamed. 

/s Funny affects south there's money furlough scheme. us Northern peasants, money help out.

How anyone ever co sider voting Tory. unbelievably incompetent, inept &amp; corrupt I've said number times, Cummings paid fine, made apology dripping insincerity, threw amount money sounds like lot charity (and extension country) would much better off. Also bars get pretty crowded. That's often whole point. Wow really made miss going bar beer. Yup. It’s like hey you’re nice me, know couldn’t get virus you. That’s prayer meetings work too. Pushing innocent meat grinder, they're doing! Feeding machine benefit. people never left mother's womb. Let suckle ovaries, feast unborn brothers sisters like predatory lunatics are, stay fuck land living! Mcdonalds kill hundreds thousands year. Sugar too. Lock downs work. fear mongering scary. Hive mind work. really understand. could done classic political shell game firing Cummings, strippong post, blast Daily Hate, stuff - quietly hire Cummings' company ""special advisory body"" shit week two. would significantly less damage country morale Boris/Cummings/etc still get keep looting country.

I just... get it. surprised? baffling people claiming breathing conditions meaning need wear mask...to help reduce risk virus least causes difficulty breathing. competent, yet equally sinister

This best description Special Relationship lot things tbh country ever survived pandemic before. war. Something bad happens world ends. know that.

Remember countries “Japan” “German-land” took loses WW2. Ever hear more? didn’t think so.

Or South lost civil war became wasteland exist old picture books??

On another note... 

How Trump causing rise cases Italy Belgium? Damn you, Trump! Damn stupid Americans lady won’t wear mask Starbucks! Damn heck! know every country can't handle like NZ? Please correct I'm wrong, women gave working raise children, divorced fully grown, would entitled certain share household assets, well least portion ""lost income"" time raising kids? Even true (which obviously isn't), kids could easily give parents, grandparents, someone else threat. party crime though? ""both sides"" day long right wing US gone totally loco, walls bonkers insace way left simply hasn't. 

Thats fact. illegal border crossings huge problem country TTI. Well im sure really depth survey, compared official government one /s Pull figures ass call facts. Reddit^^TM I'm convinced we're going point now. still part US feels like matter absolutely pissing today every mother fucker wetlook leggings panic buying expensive crap need. Let's grateful **ENFORCED** measures. Definitely good sign indeed.infection number look bit better, hopefully trend seen slowly showing hospitalizations too. 

As also noted here, graying society, hospitals already overstretched flu season years. sense becoming business usual unfortunately. problem bigger covid, huge demand healthcare, declining number people give it. 

All reason make sure infection levels stay alert level. failed tbh Yes, wishful thinking. wither storm best can. shame come has. It’s perfectly possible putting “loveable buffoon” facade malevolent buffoon truth. Given numbers US. bad would didn’t vitamin milk? sure weather report got. got 28/29 coming mon/tues. sprinklings high teens low twenties. well past 10 degree days typically winter spring (as well autumm summer) meshed together, sometimes years. particularly cold winter year, track lovely summer problem USA restaurant owners tv vowing never support direct payments want nothing less freedom infect community. England ramping mitigation efforts - Americans attending Halloween parties. many kids don’t get trick treat, young people *have* party? It’s shameful, especially looking UK/europe way is. lot businesses make past year unfortunately financially incentivized $13000 per person listed covid death.

Yeah absurd say Fox ""news"" NYT equally bad 

its reality Yep, highly contagious air borne virus, nothing like err.. called? know? highly contagious air borne viruses umm, ones kids spread like wildfire, gahhh, damn tip tongue! Help here! even make sense? think right. Clustering together indoors many people tend catch flu etc around time year. break quarter million year over. Mark words. row crew, lose grip oar hits solar plexus.

Source: sister used row. US citizen American UK lockdown? lack income would kill American immigrants UK. lanyards favourite... Gosh, that’s scary... Really sorry hear friend, hope you’re okay. Autumn arrived. Buckle winter, going quite ride I’ll rephrase, U.K. doesn’t rely tourism. Wow! sounds amazing. Humans create something like can't wear damn mask?! Dude, Master's work retail. condescending asshole, sound like someone calls garbage men losers too.  really informative, thank you. actually say agree you, spicedbec. feel you, really do. Come back Oz, welcome.  😂. saying moving average positivity increasing spite increased testing?  nonsense. Hospitals empty. Flu cases non existent. Plenty beds COVID. know live London amount people see wearing mask inside shops, nose staggering. people assume one year homeschooling break child, people would correct. whole comment thread ridiculous tbh. talking governments money irrelevant. always find/barrow/make money. problem always production. Lockdonws decrease production causes sorts problems. amount money solve issue. &amp;#x200B;

Why? why?

Can't everyone see lockdowns keep bringing back exact result? lockdown 4 weeks open cases rise lockdown again.

This nuts, anyone asked elderly want this? want isolated?? IFR getting lower lower mean maybe overreacting.

And probably business survived first lockdown survive one.

But probably everyone sub masturbating kind news that's narrative love. Apparently didn't. 90% people asymptomatic? Would good thing? not, absolute clegnut. realise many massive corporations chains affected this. 3 different health ministers 1-2 months, PM willing announce lockdown. Restriction coming late. enough lot businesses. expenses paying employees. Funny. one saw said amongst lowest Im 30 year old single guy kids know enough know environment changes lack socialness huge impacts Hope still get PS5 :( aren’t.  Lol probably are, addition substance abuse issues. Depression, anxiety. Anything concerned mental health. Getting sun challenge UK. I've seen sun month total entire year.  Germany tried control. Get back months. Fact: There's two week lag deaths increase cases.

Fact: conspiracy theory dude. CARES act enables this.
Link: agenda bro; actually facts depends language use. language use ~= NE representations equals. cares?? 99.9% fine. Hmm. virus acting like endemic mortality rate getting lower. Sure dawg huge house parties family visit. Appalling. Going lot eye tests happening. Excellent use police resources there. need go real criminls everyone fucking knows. need repeat time. can't happy positive things happen, people like always come whine past damn things time. Fucking hell. have. go heads official agency area whatever code violation going on.  


Remember, bosses bosses too, even get paid bosses still answer them. get cuff upside back head bosses, rest assured fucking around anymore matter, going much, much worse them. 


Source: I'm cook absolutely (legally) ruin restaurant purpose punish bad owners. definitely routine - ordered inpatient team thinks run it. Fortunately expensive test here. literally premise British conspiracy drama like, 2012 think. Wow. infer frequency shower asked single question countries paid entire population 2 weeks? That’s impressively dumb. 

Now, way. mitigation definitely things you’re right solving 40, 50 60% reduce problem. think solution multi faceted exact reason said above. Hell even leaders country making dumb comments like wearing mask pointless help contribute even smallest ways. point stated shut everything pay everyone two week think would next impossible pay entire population U.S. financially logistically. top size diversity US keeping people home would challenge best. point we’ve seen multiple law enforcement agencies actively defy mask orders say weren’t going enforce laws. need fix issues long decide write checks people stay home. Even China knows, ever shutdown again, _definitely_ lose medium-sizes industries. lot talks medical supply industries diversify China.

Same tech. scares finishingng nursing school classes going 4-month clinical practicum, right numbers skyrocketing. want work, want help, I'm also scared tbh. Yup. us white collar workers got forced back office. Bojo friends done fucking shitty job covid response. embarrassment commonwealth country actually head screwed on, sitting looking back family stuck Britain national strategy still nothing all. meantime leaders still argue bicker like spoiled children Alberta Florida Canada? We're approaching summer here. Zero cases Vic. jinx it! won’t matter US FDA. abundance caution continue, Americans die. true Trump job here. government, along courts private sector, *have* fighting back hacks. significant portion server network controls trickbot malware hitting hospital systems taken offline Microsoft weeks ago, DoD disrupting Russian cyber actors.

Obviously it'd much effective real leader, attacks prevented, we're *completely* undefended. Englanders. asked it. Brexit plus Covid lockdowns. Tough shit. That's life, ain't it? costs listed hit 'us' next year. cost 'locking down' hits us next week. That's calculation.

I fucking hate this. Economics suffering... I'm passing info... Sounds like projecting. Agree you, time pass law like trumpsters give 2 shits!!! vaccines receiving federal funding. way anyone entire UK going pay attention whatsoever rules meeting Christmas
You get full scale national rebellion idea you’re getting downvoted. last lockdown people walked grocery stores target Walmart aimlessly. Home Depot too. Old roommate told boyfriend spent shifts 7-11 kicking people loitering due boredom. enough people learnt ? NYS Well doesn’t work segment population doesn’t isolate. Take Sturgis biker event - even everyone around area isolated, event super spreader carried infection back attendees’ hometowns states. 

The ones isolating contributing spread don’t keep moving spreading end isolation period simply waiting spread again.  

It requires unanimous collaboration entire population work. appears impossible United States don’t even believe basic science behind existence disease. borders closed? 21,897 equal 190, 503 US cases  Yeah. Sadly insurance present pretty limited pediatrician choices within reasonable distance. emergency use December, even know vaccine risk ""in field"" people get first rest us plebeians start eligible spring hard lockdown locked house govt drops food. Yep, France equal 178,000 US cases today US deaths 418,500 America half way there.

Let sink Hi, resident Melbourne here. lockdown returning normal lives everything opening up. turns lockdowns matter :-) remember correctly 6k quickly expanded 9k according macron’s last speech think lot people mentioned replies massive amount monetary support.

In fact, one key issues kept spread going casualised workers going work sick, continuing work getting test done instead self-isolating waiting results worried able afford day off. result introduced $300 payment getting tested two criteria: a) work b) sick leave. yes respective questions got payment questions asked. tested positive kept unable work became eligible $1500 payment.

In addition federal government wage subsidy scheme place paying workers $1500 fortnight whether able work (since many places shut down). welfare doubled 6 months, that's halved (so extra 50% original) 6 months.

And finally federal government also doubled number subsidised psychology sessions available help people struggling mental toll prolonged lockdown.

Obviously fines also helped ensuring compliance really without highly doubt would worked well has. ruined anyway! 

Or... could control things like Vietnam New Zealand. Good luck exactly happened Australia. media sensationalizing usual.  going 15% week. reason stop. people rent rooms homes California whose rental include kitchen access. live fast food. FYI. everyone kitchen. Also, last lockdown supervisor’s fridge broke thanks factory shutdowns lived fast food two weeks. apologize going cells B cells. would maybe agree this, fact Canada's government media pretty tight leash here, even thing happening extent. guys real quick point flaws others noticed, typically real problem whatever hairbrained scheme one side countries crazies enacting.  


In case, multiple news sources cannot trusted sides. expect people believe favorite one. Good luck. said, Canada pretty tight leash, compared America; even still problems.  


The common factor? extremists sides same. share kinds idiots. could put factual information screen whole year, would still question it, slew corroborating evidence go all. 


So real problem? 


You seem think opinions matter. That's root it. literally job say good way determine infection rates, data literally *does show anything people area covid* fucking brainer. currently live age spin, proven inability think yourself, therefore ""redundant"" statements like ""data points cannot definitively prove correlation presented factual relation topic ***GLOBAL HEALTH CRISIS***."" Go back Facebook dude. Track trace thing actually works. look every country managed get way, it’s effective track trace. South Korea, Australia, New Zealand, China etc. track trace joke, government effectively gave £7bn mates completely unqualified job. Disgraceful. Fuck Tories Hospitals allowed elective procedures. must generate revenue function. financially incentivized $13000 per person listed covid death. ask next kin permission list pneumonia influenza death. People absolutely died solely covid. number nowhere near published. Yeah besides government, think Aussies done right thing. There’s idiots protested, majority us shut got done. 

Can imagine borders closed US? would riot. Someone UK told yesterday would rather die borders closed like us. brave altruistic. wonder last slap mask socially distance also first give intubation. ""I need stinking tube. is. tough."" talking social distancing mask wearing effective?

All say look scientists say it, make decision that. Politicians medical experts, would value opinion field experts? Feces source live Covid.  Municipal water treatment plants sample Covid RNA content none live active viruses. sewage system source infection virus. wear freaking mask!!! That's equal 178,205 US cases Mine got diagnosed last month lived...no symptoms! someone explain works way? Seems like would’ve death sentence someone old. That's better authoritarians stay scared terrified pay attention they're really doing

In good year misinformation often used distraction wheel barrows full money taken back.

Imagine much happening year one watching I'm angry it. plan thinking might work? doesn’t depends. intentions avoiding gatherings, worse. least weather warm, would outside. winter, gatherings inside. language using sounds like giving update general public. PSA kids later video? Ok tell people instead showing scary case numbers they're assumption super deadly thought back March purposely leaving IFR updated data shows complete story. propaganda one problems current approach. tell current numbers, give numbers age group listed comment include slightly conservative ones CDC linked another comment. tell numbers may rise open slightly lot people wear masks. let people make decision acceptable given personal risk tolerance. think find vast majority people would accept regardless would share mindset. Especially realize economic damage guidelines going cripple three current generations people financially rest lives. 

Just honest people let make choice. Blatantly leaving important statistics wrong propaganda. much could be! death count’s leveling percentage wise infection count keeps goin up. live Iowa, state never lockdown mandate mask mandate kind. tell quite easily Americans catching virus state. mildly cautious person probably goes grocery store week, workplace, maybe couple stores. could get places. hard tell. report stats multiple times week. Yes rising. quantity testing hasnt exponentially increased past month. Yes relevant. France’s ICU capacity? We've tried nothing! know else could've done?! Cox / herbert (2020)  would go party 400 people even without pandemic?

People active social life? Except winter peak second wave lockdown. We’re multiple days 0 cases now, still spring. Good mask usage combined lockdowns work. Melbourne proof. Yeah... no. Maybe optimized hospital organization (logistics, timetables) adjust pandemic, patients get better care. Trick treating overblown concern. You’ll fine. thing happen Europe? virus looks like it’s spreading 25% faster right now. 2 weeks suspect. One European countries pull trigger approval soon suspect NYPD relative posting facebook government can't tell can/can't home...

Er... mostly can't? imagination really limited already, would like isnt it.

I mean, herd immunity, i.e. letting virus infect everyone, become endemic, helping mutate, exactly would actually want depopulate destroy economy Melbourne took almost 4 months shutdown get day 0 new cases. Edit-

I want make something clear. Whil forced labor rises level slavery, atrocious, personally risked life overseas operation targeting forced labor, slavery, human trafficking.

Some people want try say people working inhumane conditions choice unless threatened death. bullshit. forced work threat amputation, bodily harm, debt bondage, threats family, etc ***is absolutely forced labor evil.***

I idea people claim otherwise. tried Utarded? personal favorite. wonder many cases traced Sturgis. Harley HQ Wisconsin Harleys HOG culture popular Wisconsin got point though. 1.5m apart going happen here. 4? lol. need follow example Asian countries, Australia New Zealand. island, could potentially eradicate boarder. Yes hard possible. Oh opposite sex misread think Canadian covid different something lmao 

uncontrolled viral outbreaks

another fine product

of "" thing society "" crowd CDC traces 1 billion cases bat china 999 million cases guy ate bat. whoda thunk started somewhere. implying go polls?

didnt 10 years

cant trust none folks

""wanna change something? start people around you, community etc"" Exact reason people rise ridiculous monarchy! person smart. People dumb, panicky, dangerous animals know Land trade borders big thing Australia.

Over continent size Europe fifteenth population, cities. really comparable. No.. said 'not true'.  fact true, loop make true. Actual title:

*RIVM: 9,839 new coronavirus infections; Total 2% 7-day average* Unfortunately, know someone scoffs low/deficient levels Vitamin making difference immune system. Really. cherry-pick ""low/deficient"" ignore doctor's advice take supplements bc supplements (pills) bother stomach. So, putting much case changes one person's mind supplements helps fight Covid.

Does anyone know make Vit. gummy supplements? everything else. Ya - mean election Trump going close!! dumb ratio approaching 50:50. people sit every single day lives crying restrictions, something else lives? Europe going back lockdown again. Sitting Reddit every day moaning good all. read book? Watch movie? exercise? spamming thread since March COVID going go away. learn adapt move like rest adult population? Obesity problem sure one forces burger throat walking around possibly spreading virus asymptomatic carrier different subject. view life empathy others utterly disgusting . ashamed. One best friends high school college told exact thing today. moved away home year ago barely heard year still disheartening hear. also bragging never wearing masks stores getting yelled it. could someone close friend one morons? customer corporate would say something type wants badly able prove world would definitely post online it. (She also claimed fired unfairly several jobs also racist things say former coworkers jobs...) live south coast 99/100 people wearing mask inside shops. Close 2x ahead, that. Right plan send babysitter instead. issue still remains transmission risk babysitter. Failing that, parents may shielding potentially wrong side 60. Except getting education. 

Anyway clearly can't understand concepts I'm referring too. I'm unsure European countries set parents work. kids choice, however everyone abandoning everyone look screw everyone else work society carved particular set dynamics, includes looking kids medical professionals help people need. 

My kids personally born pandemic wide support network. means anything really regardless plan people know schools infinite capacity offer space 20-30 kids school 300 key workers children, much better option. Keep younger healthy teachers involved let vulnerable teachers go home. 

I'm sorry offends wrong KEY WORKERS Children.

That said general population really understand kids kept school transmission risk bad news teachers. scenario schools rammed transmission extremely likely. feeds virus yet another baffling decision like eat help out. blaming Trump?  Honestly care much 💁‍♀️ think it’s worth loss lives ignore help trump get re-elected. company said Thursday third-quarter earnings call logged $7.5 billion COVID-related costs since disease took root earlier year. Amazon expects incur $4 billion COVID-related costs next quarter. killing people = ok.
 
Killing business = ok.  happens half-ass restrictions lockdowns. Get two thirds way there, ""we need open back up, damaging economy"". Sigh.

We reported zero cases zero deaths Victoria, three weeks right-wing media going ""cases low enough, surely open up..."" Meh.  Get long wooden handle nice thick shovel blade shape sharpen, make lobo. blown away npr article stated almost 100,000 new cases day... said cases asymptomatic.

You know asymptomatic means exhibit symptoms, infectious, right?

How people asymptomatic make Covid less bad? know anything mortality rate variants? less likely result death, likely, equally likely? Fuck Corona! healthcare workers refuse public places cesspools potential carriers.... Gas stations, Grocery stores etc etc.

I watched several nurses go places masks required (but enforced) without mask even chins. act like nothing going on. may true, however getting sense correct amount deaths looking amount people died per year last decade. hit average US yearly deaths two months ago two months go. something killing people US. Trump: Corona tests easy... Vote me! passed mine. ok. open spread faster. great idea. Oh yea, mean you. Meant towards think bad yet. course would, i'm assing searching way ""contain"" future deaths without closing everything like march. That's still announced one yet.

I guess impose stricker measures (like region region travel, good reasons) without closing non essentially workers.

They already closed every restaurant&amp;co. 6pm 5am (only takeaway permitted) forced announce countermeasures stop firings march. can't more

As already said, like i'm ok them, realistically point view, another option. kinda fortunate tought, father inside programs, mother nurse job assured (but high risk) theoretically, yes. covid lot less contagious It’s weekend. That’s reporting works. Huh? Wtf hou even saying?
It literally said Jesus Lord, God, Father everything. scriptures linked said that. 
I'm going explain again. 
No Jesus saying God thr person lol. stoned believe thought blasphemous. 
And atheists cannot go heaven. says clearly cannot go good deeds only. fairh alone good works alone both. 
Lol keep changing story can't contest points. 
And beginning Jesus

Genesis 1:2 
2*He* beginning God.

Ephesians 2:8-9

For grace saved faith. doing; gift God, result works, one may boast.

In case unclear saying saved grace faith. Aka us faith God saves us Grace. result works aka saved works done, therefore boast good deeds. 

John 14:6

Jesus said him, “I way, truth, life. one comes Father except me.

Aka atheists cannot go heaven. Also popes wrong lol. know human influenced also think bad things? pope qho murderer. Also thought said th bible tested evil works? believing pope uses bible? Lmao


John 3:16 
“For God loved world, gave Son, whoever believes perish eternal life.

Romans 6:23
For wages sin death, free gift God eternal life Christ Jesus Lord.

Titus 3:5

He saved us, works done us righteousness, according mercy, washing regeneration renewal Holy Spirit,

Romans 10:9
Because, confess mouth Jesus Lord believe heart God raised dead, saved.

Romans 3:23
For sinned fall short glory God,

Doesn't matter good deeds do. says sinned fallen short glory God. except virus spread leave house, spreads close contact people. inside house outside walk safe. people can't go outside ends inside together, that's get spread. There's reason viruses tend spread faster winter. Eat balanced diet get sun. information. month still. forget we're dealing novel virus. know long term effects. virus spreads easily, “test” invasive? cheek swab? They're nowhere go. Forget losing tourists dollars summertime. think people completely isolate mentally taxing mentally. luxury, people social bubbles everyone meets 2-4 people. seems like optimal way socially distancing still mental facilities intact. People need consistent approach.  immunity, school much safer environment, it, Donald you? Basically, people want go work get kids sight find kind sad Yes, here’s perfect example sheep. Follow rules, listen government, hate everyone else doesn’t follow. puppet. ain’t spreading shit coz haven’t got shit, thick cunt. 

And I’m putting life hold longer bullshit virus fatties die every year coz obesity yet isn’t restrictions Big Mac meal. get know exactly who. trump supporting coworker. You’re one people think North Koreans free express themselves, aren’t you? would amusing see data needing fed neural net produce theories wonder predictions second third week November, whether factored one million people attending polling stations among crowds others they're still going ahead. exactly situation NEED federal government for. we're getting nothing. country oil becomes unstable... scheme called furlough businesses use pay 80% employee’s wages. theory, cover employee’s bills. found 58 people coinfection, among mortality rate 43.1% (25). died, 80% (20) aged 70.

Small sample size really don’t want works couple month. infect everyone day, let break day let everyone recover day *covid herd immunity* dangerous activity since outside linger houses, plus everyone wears mask Waiting face reveal Yep, another Melburnian measures strict, like anyone *wants* commuting 1hr office packed like sardine tram 5\*C raining outside. 

Traditionally winters Melbourne bleak depressing af, lockdown means easy I'm glad (a) proved world done, (b) got case numbers \~750/day 0 (c) got people wearing masks GOD DAMN want culture ""wear fkn mask sick going public"" here, getting coughed public transport worst. Good, prevents last chance shopping partying Mexico 4th highest confirmed deaths, yet feels like coverage pandemic Mexico (and Latin America general) sparse under-reported. Damn vast majority? Sounds like least 200 million dead. Sure, leaders brag defeated virus already.

That's whole point: even barely competent leadership could saved tens thousands lives Yes, used Texas jumped Florida since cons got voted ( conservatives, criminals shit really). Welcome lockdown Episode 2. Happy joined us France. America disgrace point, I've run sympathy. Let country burn. 

You want kill loved ones ignorance, cry later it. fucking deserve suffer. Yes contact tracing. literally pull mask talk you. boggles mind. Yeah, deal social anxiety like stupid, staying home good anxiety working. (I work casino industry imagine anxiety is) 

I used think antisocial bad thing, ... hope one thing keep safe safe effective Covid shot like flu shot. 

Only thing taken hit extra spending money.... spend hobbies since home more. made headway things started April 2019. much interest going NYC... living hell hole state live called California. Need get away moronic govenors. Higher even - measles 92-95% herd immunity completely airborne.

Covid around 80%. way we've politicized baffled me, bail small businesses, soft lockdowns, freeze rent/utilities now. make everyone happy able agree, would hope. deaths took place 8-9 month period

I've seen people starting compare death toll US casualties Civil War World War II - remember, wars \~4 years conflict USA. fact, annualized rate, COVID pandemic killing Americans per year Civil War WWII combined. downvoting searched facts (one gave link see I'm making stuff up).

I really know yall honestly. kind hypocritical say ""look facts scientist,"" tell moderate story, sudden conspiracy. That's fuckin sad man... can't tell Covid overblown serious government made be. example, blown away npr article stated almost 100,000 new cases day... said cases asymptomatic. And, can't find posts reddit anywhere people discussing whether think covid overblown. one question??? People like reason going second lockdown. Get think others life stop spreading virus thats literally killing hundreds thousands people piece shit. can't nice summer send kids away. pandemic April so, people moved lives. Way ""both sides"" whole thing. Take good care yourself. risk. 1. article written Canada, study Spain.

2. can't excluded possibility COVID makes sick body's response use vitamin reserves. take multivitamin doctor, **I'm** Pagliacci!

*laugh track* There's going selection bias there. Type families sending summer camp clearly put much value social distancing, families already cleared virus may open resuming pre pandemic activities. never told lie right 😄 US excess deaths year 300k. people dying from?  Thanks! Fortunately I'm endangered group really like spread anything family right now. states alone. gave many relationships year. longer wish associate people normalize death COVID (or murdering African Americans cop, assaulting women grabbing pussies, or....you get it).

I've met new people online, frown closer others via zoom, pretty lonely irl contact, live alone. this, too, shall pass, patient. days.  Amazing.

Herd immunity ""strategy"". something bound happen point vaccine next years. would really interesting see many women mothers. opposing forces work reopening work return normal. One force fear contracting coronavirus. [in part] economy's need people go back work socialization close contact.

Now, question: greatest risk death virus? older population. could say Boomer Generation. 

Next question: greatest disposable wealth US? Boomer Generation. So, B.G greatest risk, greatest fear, going sitting home. still need food, medical care, ability buy things on-line. going sitting rest wealth resume active participation safely outside home. saying price paid economically vaccination works means level virus subsides. think high risk economic return normal compatible. could wrong, that's scenario far. White privilege able live parents work home pandemic fine. don’t think white privilege playing role lockdowns you’re misinformed what’s happening minorities right message might get attention. America always wants number 1... can't jailed escaping slavery. Literally would case would go front UN human rights counsel. Would pain? Yes, international law treaties force people labor.

Hopefully culture changes Yes saw weren’t planning closing schools universities, makes sense completely agree there. think gov keeping open online? lecturer think motive telling us?  wish true would mean *someone* charge. fact - conspiracy theorists never get - one charge. would Bilderbergers occult society secretly plotting dimly lit rooms X-Files style Cigarette Smoking Man going around...

I think would make many people sigh relief even though helmsmen might acting best interest. least would *order* *chaos.* 

But sad fact is, species screwing around aimlessly. *telos* according science anyway. Yes agree, didn’t mentioned earlier already place didn’t think set new restrictions.

I've noticed female conspiracy groups health related mother. mommy conspiracy theories gave children autism. Male conspiracy theory groups paranoid anger coming get us need band together. 

There's thinkers believe gender 100% social construct there's nothing innate. buy it. really seem differences. Yeah still falls explanation - people care, why? simply never given explained actual severity situation, sources trust. media watch read would put lot emphasis HORRIBLE people care are, I'm pretty sure would start caring. Besides, yes, think people stupid shit rn kind conspiracy theorists, go ""all in"" conspiracies order start stupid shit. long-term friend childhood visited recently (in around july 2 infected per day country, things great) refused wash hands ""what for? I'm coming straight house"". Clearly never watched video watched experiment show visually virus spreads black light cool liquid lights it. understand spreads, coupled believing covid planned population control, consciously puts others danger. Conspiracy theories contribute ""I care"" attitude sooo many ways. Every 3 days tell mother article shared Covid world-wide hoax hoax, never conspiracy theorist trusts scientists responsible. sees shit every day, automatically, begins believe subconsciously. want know would happened tell conspiracy. people like unfortunately. example make active effort stay away conspiracies. Others actively look find ""truth"". complicated plays human ego natural selfishness, conspiracy theories ""alternative"" stuff play huge role people's behavior. country paying millions people working deliver food round clock everyday, it’s countrywide outbreak

It’s another day joyless, empty pandemic existence, I’m going pretend it’s not. 

The worst memes “halloween isn’t cancelled!! parties!! still eat candy watch horror movies!!” like wow, stuffing face alone front screen isn’t depressing all. mention that’s I’ve past eight months.

Somehow bat coronavirus got spike proteins pangolin. details still TBD. cost taxpayer money house motherfucker said 3x4 cell. What’s telling yet source support claims. 

Herd immunity impossible without viable vaccine. reach herd immunity COVID-19, likely 70% population would need immune. Without vaccine, 200 million Americans would get infected reach threshold. Put another way, even current pace COVID-19 pandemic continues United States, won’t reach herd immunity 2021. current daily death rates continue, half million Americans would dead COVID-19 time. friends families China, saying life normal there, except masks still required public transportation etc. economy seems well, going Germany's report automobile sale domestic travel data. cremation data Wuhan reportedly skewed fact burning bodies, also burned huge amount medical waste PPE. know true plausible.

China's strategy early harsh lockdowns aggressive contact tracing, seem moved onto wide, frequent testing targeted lockdowns since. See details. mask time versus use associated decreased risk SARS-CoV-2 infection adjustment age; sex; exposure contact; sharing dishes, cups, cigarettes; handwashing 

Edit: pretty sure people looking excuses hand wave examples responses virus appear successful question local responses virus working well. ""but Japan authoritarian"" favourite ""but New Zealand *an* island."" first official result morning noon shift. 828 518 people tested, 7947 positive, around 1%. Considering tests show negative early stages low viral load real number obviously bit higher, that's there's going second round next weekend. *when virus decide over, like, America continent ironic thing followed similar plan US had. Trump decapitate institutions supposed run plan. Send idiots say oooh 4 percent death rate. People can't think binary. Live die, simple. Biden well aware quite sure ""they"" are.

Globalist Jews. annoying hear we'll ""only"" 20 million doses X vaccine ready 2021 30 million doses vaccine March, etc, adds up. There's gonna lot doses lot vaccines widely available spring. Common sense common anymore doubt many even realize EU country.

Now, now. reaching across internet hand clear quartz crystal. believe supposed make feel all-around better. Hang ear piece mask. ;) Idk use data, demonstrably false.

We 300k deaths covid almost month. gave everyone $1200. Anyone got laid got $600+ week unemployment.  government making us go eat. weddings vacations high school sports. people. building site 80 people, can’t go mums house. Go Tesco 200 people, can’t support local cafe/brew house. It’s joke. good know, situation bit edge case. one guy particularly annoying, possibly spectrum, talks loudly (sometimes himself!) without mask. 

We work near pizza oven, sometimes find hard breathe mask near hot oven; lot workers take masks near oven, want make everybody's life difficult one guy.

And bad relationship guy; he's friends owners, keeps getting rehired despite fact owners know everyone dislikes guy I've previously quit guy. (I think needs money health problems, maybe?). 

I like talking guy, he's yelled enough times best behavior, want start drama. He's trying nice guy.

So really, stand around area restaurant, avoid him, let trusty KN95 mask job; even get virus, mask reduce viral load lessen symptoms. 😂 nice intelligent rebuttal Currently nearing end 14 days, loss smell taste weird distinctive symptom. wasn’t stuffed runny nose, like sense smell taste disappeared nowhere. Within hours. 4 days tossing turning night, issues breathing kept feeling like needed gasp air random. I’m 26 generally healthy. 

I’m glad I’m finally starting feel better, hope well too. Can't expect minimum wage shop workers enforcing mask rules though. get enough shit I'd like think people would use common sense quiet Christmas home, regardless rules. 

But think right. Many families go ahead normal Christmas plans, even meet bigger groups normal make lack contact rest year. January see impact that. quite million more. Yeah, pretty good laugh. know else explain I'll try. day day week week fluctuate lot. down. large scale, (lets say month month) continually less deaths. I'm saying virus spreading faster, pointing positive note. getting better better treating it. Americans stupid.

Visiting friends family indoors without PPE get it, dumbfucks. students still stay school Christmas shoppers Good. people pack bars. without that, break infection chains. point small victory still victory. studies showing correlation restaurant spending infection increases/outbreaks.

*Police bolt fast office bounce like three stooges Yakety Sax playing background try jump department armored personnel carrier* Comments like always compare lockdown lockdown, negatives unmanaged pandemic far worse lockdown. cant see people getting cancer treatment hospitals overun covid patients, suicides mental health issues also caused loved ones dying deaths massively increase healthcare stretched.

A competent govenment help mitigate this, theyre short supply nowadays especially UK US right partner direct victim treatment Covid nightmare. going say, novel coronavirus designed knocking human populations, people behind pretty poor job it. way likely catch inside. outside safest place don’t want catch covid kind mask use? fit properly? I've seen plenty people wearing flimsy masks practically falling faces, whenever hear stories like wonder strong person's mask game was. valid concerns studied sure. exist reason conclude worse effects lockdown.

If healthcare system overwhelmed alot things mentioned issues scenario too, bar poverty issue. Tories pissing away vast sums friends businesses current climate anyway could used address poverty issue - although extend furlough one least. live paycheck paycheck time. Cut us 80 percent would struggle food keep door wide open, keep open inches. religious getting enough *good quality* sleep every night*.* Maybe buy one high-quality air filters office. 

Or, could lie them. Say taking care old, immunocompromised grandmother. Make yourself, able talk shit (it's *me,* want accidentally bring home *grandmother*). People respect commitment resolve keep poor old grandmother safe. think highly commitment protect elderly. Make known management rest office staff going extremely vigilant order ensure accidentally kill grandmother. Use excuse OCD careful want. point, I'm even sure individuals smart - are, things like pandemic fatigue impacting even otherwise rational people one thing locked whole state, stricter rules city rest state selected articles Summer, current outbreak much happening 4-8 weeks school opening Fall indications trending towards contrary conclusions. Michigan done that, save low occupancy person dining, cases still much rise, largely rural areas like mine half people see wearing masks law enforcement may may enforce bars open.

This continue Consequences non compliance. Lockdowns work. save lives. problems listed solely caused lockdown, maybe exacerbated, caused. example, stable, loving parents beginning beat kids they're locked inside. Already evil people may more.

Lockdown #1, even though late, prevented thousands dying, stopped NHS overwhelmed helped us gain control virus. for, worth impacts we'll receive. Please stop anti-lockdown rhetoric, make virus persist widespread state, longer. already add vitamin milk? sick guy. Vitamin Britain never found bad people think. think acceptable positivity rate is? curious. 0 isn’t option time precautions eradicate flu, waited til 2020 it? years words. would put us less half way one. don’t think really understand exponential spread massive consequences would entail. seen far nothing. Avoid lockdown looking millions deaths couple months. Total collapse healthcare. Probably incredible social disruption. case numbers way high 2 week lockdown anything thousand save corona end exponentially increasing everything else massive net loss. Yeh thats mother nature us going national anathalaactic shock already formulated Marx 200 years ago. Electoralism always favor capitalism, centrism never worker rights. Umm money money money. masks work lol. advice worthless. wtf quit get job like instead purposely ruining business putting coworkers job. worst kind person. I'm sure trump got vote. voted that's big if. bad coworker passive aggressive shit make coworkers life harder. Statistically many people risk age school aged children.. Australia (Melbourne, City 5 million people) severe lockdown curfew mandatory face masks massive fines noncompliance, u talking about. also national ban international travel mandatory supervised 2 week hotel quarantine. That's way beat actual outbreak. Typhoid Donny's rallies like 500 simultaneous summer camps old people. wonder holds true traditional influenza cancer. show strong relationships Vit well. Gathering opinions: United States, see scenario U.S. shuts Jan. 20th? Making go along sometimes that's true degree, true individually voted person question, case less half country voted Trump. I'd also argue whatever people fell for, even knowingly voted for, years back, one deserves this. breaking infections chains. spreading slower faster. ""lockdown"" whatever ... gonna that. Cummings utter cunt? He’s even portrayed human new season spitting image. People individually get decide laws apply them, Yes. party Tootally worth killing others I’ll either get work niece, goes party college town every weekend. think comparaison possible too. Density different areas, different testing per capita too, I'm sure criteria would actually make pertinent comparaison. 

But yeah, situation Europe really disastrous well. think got fooled ""break"" got summer. reddit ... worse china. freedom speech? DEAD HERE. mean, that’s masks work. Masks really aren’t needing outside. won’t get covid walking street. *dabs Australian* NY number going up, eventually quarantine daily till spring comes idea. government give hotel vouchers essential workers live multi-generational households. 

Contract tracing shows common infection people household. EMT, grcoery store worker, postal worker etc live 70 year old parents, getting hotel voucher.

This would also help hotel industry. Oh forget ones say ""I'm dick I'm wearing mask"" effective! I'd say 20% people supermarkets near wearing masks let northerners tell they're unfairly treated. Well, I'm American, friends worldwide - story everywhere. 

Get pictures France people partying. Place locked down. Get pictures Texas. Hospitals literally capacity. Get pictures Canada - Everything's locked tight. 

Not American thing. picked McDonalds Southern California morning 3 cars front didnt masks on. Usually they're supposed serve customer dont mask on. clearly didnt care Holy shit, realized several US states closing 1 million cases

According Texas: 955K cases
* California: 933K cases
* Florida: 802K cases I’m currently year 11 let tell “bubble” size small town mixing entire school People know starting take less serious even though pandemic worsening. careful first, they’re fed staying away places like airplanes, bars beauty salons. It’s frustrating watch. sorry hear that. able give incentive spirometer help weakness breathing? Da fack. Death death. would old people dying prematurely matter? GTFOH. Exactly. Almost everyone interviewed article states don’t mask mandates. Doesn’t matter wear one (at least common surgical fabric mask) one else around does. seconds pressing Reply thought ""I edit add /S"" :D Lol like choose give to? 

Oh love you, won’t spread germs you. fuck people grocery store...  normalized number tests?   stood line 30 minutes front local elementary school, police officer sent one windows showed ID card, gave phone number received piece paper number (two halves), moved next window medic took sample nose gave one halves. 20 minutes waiting schoolyard called number received paper confirms negative result. surprisingly well organised, expected much worse. first mistake made, taking facebook comments seriously. quickly phone. I'm happy go back forth later (need drive) that's true. I'm molecular geneticist, I've working working COVID therapeutics since January, team collectively reviews new literature daily. School obviously environment transmission respiratory viruses happen. also definitely environment COVID-19 spreads. much happens much matters virus context specific, respiratory viruses spread easily schools.

School closures [very clearly reduce COVID-19 infection death link studies later **there studies showing schools contribute COVID-19 spread**, studies insufficient evidence draw conclusion, able quantify contribution.

Whether right close schools complex decision factor social psychological effects children, suitability home environment, knock effects parents work health, course effects spread outcomes disease itself. open question whether COVID-19 spreads schools. Well, “public servants” congressman senators need maintain 100k+ salaries, therefore rest people need suffer without government relief. parents got married 8 months dating.
They together 30 years happily filing divorce. Hey, placebo effect helps people feel better right now, not? voted current government? really sad right

it going much bigger problem gets elected past looks like to...
i guess still thinks go vaccine it'll take month/years get everyone vaccined

wish guys best change ✌🏻😷 could go back normal Thanksgiving would   virtually impossible. bring cases zero 2 weeks, cases left, it'll flare again. Even Australia still keep locking down. ""More doubtful"".

The first paper calls second. bureaucratic infighting.

The excess death occurs peak case loads. measure month-by-month get excess deaths. average low death months high death months, get average slightly low deaths overall.

Which means Japan lying extent harm caused waves outbreak really major policies controlling spread. same. primary care dr u ask prescription? Mine agreed due health issues younger typical age got local pharmacy flu shot. Single people horny. think it’s people can’t afford oblivious it. make sure general population gets vitamin Deluded think 4 weeks long enough, especially numbers they're seeing. need look Melbourne long actually takes, Christmas cancelled, know yet. what's going Europe? cases spiking, spiking now? said suspected cases. Youre one jumping conclusions. I'll never forget quarantined sub china_flu beginning, freaking out, calling end world. stocking, prepping, whole nine yards. became apparent trump give shit, complete 180 started pushing chloroquine zinc claiming flu. complete ideological shift basically overnight took dear leader saying big deal. Nah replies state poll exists. hell wrong Trump? two kids. It’s responsibility provide care anyone else’s. That’s problem today, people kids expect schools ones raising someone else solve problems them. Hey, right, thanks correcting r0 Define social distancing, talking people crowding int shopping malls bars people able see grandparents go in-person dates? one kind social distancing likely last isn't. Man, Big Mask really dropping fucking ball. chance raise stock price like, 1,000%-fold handed silver platter I'm still stuck nearly year later wearing glorified fucking t-shirt face here.

Flee lives shouted. 😂 I'm expecting things close Chicago. portion cited procedures aerasolize virus high concentrations, next line notes problems study. 

The takeaway earlier article: mask time versus use associated decreased risk SARS-CoV-2 infection adjustment age; sex; exposure contact; sharing dishes, cups, cigarettes; handwashing  everyday citizens get fee fees hurt black guy could president, elect incompetent moron... kind fault. Honestly parent would problem figure out. chose kids, responsibility General populations’ school districts problem. valid point make. Language matters. say write betray us shows fallacy kind. 

It good see people aware this. I'm same. taking high dose vitamin c realised gave horrific heartburn. go walks vit D. obviously treatment anything, healthy general going give better odds. Idaho's governor things try slow down. Granted rather milquetoast response. 
The Lt. governor however.. nutjob. Non-American here, wish true... They're smart they're deep thinkers, think mostly shallow emotions. reflect things. Cuz online learning sucks big time, every soul involved. unique situation, likely unsolvable, Brexit illustrated. wish luck.

I'd heard Ireland Melbourne style lockdown, realise Northern Ireland onboard.

Is NI also locking down? said. men wash hands. Point made, either. can't say then? peddle batshit insane conspiracy theories... Good news tomorrow Sunday it'll lower Neither I, live life. go work every day outside don’t follow guidelines 100%, would impossible. point mitigate chances careful normal. However there’s line living life pandemic completely disregarding what’s going around you. seem like good person, I’m sure good people well. don’t let get down!

Then weak ass morons got panties hurt black guy president, elected like minded moron threw away.

Blame them, 100% fault. know man. understand is, Australia New Zealand basically western cultured countries Asia, able take temporary sacrifice liberty fellow citizens. can't Europe America? makes sense!  Common sense backed science. Antigen test  Nobody denying Covid here, people rather let 80 year-olds die let country slip dictatorship. people. Even summer camps churches fuckfests. democracy plutocracies it’s development kids line throwing out. It’s keeping parents work (which large number working home anyway don’t want kids 24/7). It’s economically driven. They’ll find person “expert” run view kids become smart rocks learn line.  also putting school staff well families kids (and coworkers) risk almighty $ Mother Nature hurry. much longer time line.

Outdoors safer indoors, masks safer masks, small father's safer large gatherings per Dr Fauci Well... nice knowing everybody. whole point wait get vaccine allow us achieve herd immunity safely. need hosting large parties still healthy social life. strategy requires 100 percent (or even 95 percent matter...) compliance bound fail. Try putting 3 together let know stats say. I'll refer concept ""cognitive dissonance."" Enjoy. Hey least groceries stores still stocked. Sometimes take public panic account making policies think like current state things projecting. hell wrong you? seriously tantrum I'm North Dakota . People think ANYONE affected it, it'll go away election.

Care guess state highest Covid rate per capita? guaranteed likely help. bunch them. means they're something US surrenders. We're better place condition continue worsen. kind test administered? Thanks There’s sucker born every minute expected. Population density high poverty rampant due decades mismanagement taxation. state works ""essential"" site jobs meaning can't avoid out. Unfortunately going get worse enter typical brutal IL winter. ***Billions*** poverty and/ord debt virus twinkle fuzzy little Chinese woodland critter's eye. What, exactly, point? yet, lockdowns still worked. problem US put mitigation policies keep COVID manageable like China did. Testing abysmal contact tracing, whole mess unemployment/stimulus keeping borders open.

This sub like admit whatever reason, US lockdowns supposed do. US brought weird idea needed lockdown bit get back ""normal"" immediately, EU. Exactly economy reopen, california can't get control making people go bankrupt, homeless shutting business career. Also like said, covid spreads like wildfire, people leave houses, lockdown kill everyone wildfire, stupid action one take, trapping inside, oxygen, waiting burnt eventually. Plus using wildfire comparison, human would trees grass, ever seen anyone locking trees plants avoid wildfires? thing places forest management insane like newsom. would like killing people avoid virus spread. Yep that's exactly psycopaths like would want reach goal, that's keep using wildfire comparison covid using flu comparison would make far sense normal human would do. Pepperidge farm remembers. Mid-November going fun Cuomo friends drawing new cluster zones. 

Fucking idiots. Yep treatments vaccines adaptation all. right, pull out. I'm long term relationship. 

22 100 people use method get pregnant following trend Spanish Flu, second wave worse, 3rd wasnt bad previous two gonna lie, I’m stringent person you’re ever going find. I’m fully quarantined. least don’t put dog pony show social media claim I’m careful actually am. comfort levels different mine that’s fine, least honest it. Common sense does.

You don’t NEED visit beach NEED go shopping clothes.

When need food, get food, need medical attention, go get medical attention. 

Why everyone need spoon fed them? use brains Remember social media going unite world? Yeah happened that? Turns elites learned fantastic means create propaganda circumvents standard fact checkers media academia. people educated online worse society gets. No. [CFR still 10% high 29% yes, many better chance survival learn disease. None impacts prevents illness, hospitalization rates, virulence infection rates. think every time see type headline. stop taking vitamin religiously previously mind you. every comment ""Here go again"" Nope. Deaths come complications without preexisting conditions. Covid Nick Cordero's body gone time died. known pre existing conditions. certainly died complications Covid.

Herman Cain beat cancer years ago. preexisting conditions. He'd likely still without Covid. 2 nursing homes community lost 1/4-1/3 patients within week each. definitely high death rate frailty age, level death one time simply would happened without Covid hitting wards.

By way, example causes death would typically marked Covid cardiac arrest. Believe me, are. ;-)

Greetz EU. Trump totally gonna fire Fauci second wins re-election.

He can't fire Fauci. Fauci career civil service whole system followed fired. Trump basically stuck Fauci. 

Birx tenuous position could fired. lockdown would harm good. #1 whole world BB!!!! 330million people. two countries world bigger you. so, dont freak out. look something like 'infected per week per million' instead. multiple reasons cold/flu spreads cold weather also feel big factor. supposed colder winter well. “Check Instagram!” time would ever come close reaching herd immunity already vaccine. mitigating damage vaccine arrives distributed. grandmother confirmed case yesterday she’s already dead today. Funerals burials aren’t allowed it’s straight cremation “virtual ” viewing. Hmmm could wonder...

#ExponentialGrowth USA! USA! USA! Huh? getting info from?  I'm peruvian living states.
I family south america since u travel without visa passport anymore. part okay. Then, reopened everything went downhill. say reopened, took advice health department minister economy branch. That's South America.
They've touting ivermectin since pandemic started, really. know why. never saw gains it. 
PS, articles states doctors went behind president's back started treating everyone ivermectin cures ""one dose"". Why? So, could reopen everything.
And FYI Dr Hector Carvallo actually selling ""ivermectin"" regimen facebook.  Czech mate never said year. anyone surprised point? Nascar No. Maybe 2 3 weeks there's nationwide lockdown.

Not mandates people realize own. better get asshole White House fast literally live prophecy George Orwell.... Masks work. Really. We'll show (if pay us). Totally fine. I’ve entire pandemic always wearing regular mask keeping social distance haven’t gotten relative hotspot early on, even went spent night NYC. maybe I’ve gotten lucky. even functional government country anymore. I'm saying. effect. problem United States didn’t unitedly across states. 7 deaths dude? C'mon. I'm saying there's hermetic seal city, going forward we'll see ripples waves. significant community immunity endemic coronaviruses kill people every year too.  V-shape recovery everyones talking THANKS 100k CASES - REACH 150k?

THIS EPISODE SPONSORED NORDVPN Infections shooting straight since middle September. Amount deaths per week since early September. Could maybe getting closer everyone risk dying already dead?  winning yet? people supposed pay bills forced close biz? Unemployment pay enough keep people afloat. second stimulus talks 2021. 

How people suppose survive live country refuses offer type financial support? Oh fuck.

I expecting Halloween/voting spike :( needs vaccine?! herd immunity time! video bleach comment. try talk science bit Trump cuts off. sure would way better place.

I think biggest flaw American system government prepared legit crazy person. Everything built assumption President would rational thinker. Even Richard Nixon Andrew Jackson managed that. Trump whole different ball game. think everyone tested negative immune tested negative virus one time? believe u/prguitarman one seems talking many states well suddenly deep shit rallies.  really putting effort covid-19 right now? actual fuck. absolutely taken care now? +1 sentiment   I'm guessing saw entire email exchange may get idea actually said... thought. idea actually happened case friend mine works CVS told ball rolling COVID protocols companies... obviously people got bits pieces info page. Seems quick throw people bus article. need get information straight. don’t seem idea “Defunding” actually means.

How gain actual insight issue cast aspersions commit frame mind. informed duty every responsible citizen. Otherwise ignorant ballast rest society. Don’t worthless. Take upon functioning member think they're best tool reason. Yes. feel sick stomach. know handful people virus one died feel utterly depressed see grand failure life time. 230,000 Americans dead, 100k cases day, surging worse ever before. yet half population brainwashed thinking normal acceptable. 

It's disturbing. Winter come. Easter probably process described seems reasonable hard pass article. reads like created CDC expert told come process resume cruises best ability. But, administration... smokescreen Trump crony certify cruise line gone steps based whatever whims have?

I expect Trump loses, administration goes scorched Earth make Biden's job difficult possible. So, scenario, set bunch ships certified January book bunch passengers next several months, Biden shut cruises back making bad guy. means death rate number deaths Lol, safely go clubbing mid-thirties don’t kids. least wear mask negate science, unlike orange blob offspring iq 160 {altogether} they'll blame Biden woke time way Pandemic. totally over. Can't tell? 

Just magically disappeared, ignore new cases... Probably really 3x number cases April 2x better treating virus preventing deaths checks out. People outraged, normal response. Almost everyday here. guys also comorbidities? likely life death get it. doctor, I'm pretty sure not. It’s bit like plot John Lewis Christmas advert choose ""may""

Next. That’s fucked right there. First many cases probably. 

USA!

Imagine 2nd lockdown successful lowering cases, telling family can't take kids visit Grandma ""essential""? people can't go dates they're ""essential?"" So-called common sense good enough, need clearly defined rules based scientific merit else people use legal wiggle room skirt around them.

You made statement:

 reason need keep lockdowns, people don’t follow simplest rules:

So, people go grocery shopping doctor's government inefficient set decent contact tracing program good testing capacity? That's basically saying.

Yes is. republican party bailing businesses avoiding giving anything people avoid moral two notions diametrically opposed, ample savings would need bailed out?

Exactly. businesses expected ample savings need bailed out? Private citizens expected this, little issue outlook savings, long businesses aren’t forced close doors. That’s emergency. It’s manufactured destruction.

It’s oh wife would quit job answer. aside would wife quitting job you? nobody west work free

What strange (and unsourced) assertion. Western countries aren’t requiring citizens “work free.” 

That’s called red herring fallacy. Ex flown think six times since January critically important tasks ""going beach"" ""Las Vegas.""

Most people really stupid, that's entire point bell curve. people simply care anybody really, end day, comes it.

I hope I'm wrong... NUMBER ONE NUMBER ONE ! going crazy headlines past week ""biggest one day increase record""? turning corner wrong way. thinks repeat lie again, people start believe it.

And fair, turned corner. wrong direction.   beginning pandemic limited testing probably missing 66-80% cases. Nowadays I’m guessing we’re missing half cases. halloween elections.... still need attend daily online classes, need complete assignments, ""pretty much off"".

My 15 year old stepson actually prefers physically going school another period online classes, like lockdown March, generally hates school. great right you’re going round circles, you’re always turning corner.

Life minimizing deaths rates. Many us agree quality life 2020 markedly lower 2019. Anybody votes Trump blood hands. Hate blunt, there's way say it. Taking excess deaths account already quarter million like 300k territory. 7 average everyday 40-50 cases per day. Brooklyn 1 town. brooklyn one borough 5. include Long Island surging cases, AGAIN. EEG indications altered mental status (61.7 %)


But compare similar cohort people COVID-19?

It’s time get angry fight. grew Idaho, find hilarious gun-toting doomsday preppers can't handle mask mandate actual pandemic. least Mormons magic underwear protect them. infection rate exceeding 1 new case per second....

Anger rage logical reaction right now. remember, we're ""turning corner,"" apparently.

Just like like reopenings *totally* going result surge beginning June.

Or virus ""run course"" ""going second wave"" beginning September. It’s 9 million confirmed total cases 3 million active. minus total cases total deaths recoveries get active cases. example, India 8,138,166 total cases. minus 121,681 deaths, minus 7,430,911 recoveries get 583,574 active cases. “good” news living PA increase attributed large part increased testing. case count 600 worst number spring positivity rate still 6%. super. it’s like Midwest. 

To me, what’s scary bad virus likely MONTHS testing lagged horribly didn’t pick “surge” 4 months ago Yip, person. real ill regard contempt held people stated misinformation made bend. knocking professional standing. 
 Maybe 1983 hunch damage career know. possible created aura around perfect timing influenced people's opinion stuck went promotions.

Wow, excellent point hadn’t realized. crazy cases coming much less populated regions country. hope enough resources hospital beds. Especially Belgium! Calling good news seems arbitrary. Mutations make virus weaker too. don’t think person appropriate. said, seems elementary schools lot spread school, seems get worse higher grades go. assessment? Yeah - 101,462 politicized Europe too.  guess, worldometers cuts day around 9 10pm EST. late reports might trickle next day. Panhandle Idahoan, assure catching y’all anytime soon. county went back orange. one new case today. Which, pretty usual us. 

Got pretty scared 22 cases day week. funeral went deceased’s family didn’t distance wear masks. Jerkasses. wonder blame this... hrmmm... hard naysayers continue bray death rate down, hospitalizations. So, that's apparently virus going behave throughout Winter Flu Season. state FILLED brim people whistling past goddam graveyard.  
In meantime, Wichita, entire Via Christi health care system overwhelmed, administration looking overflow tents since beds claimed. People get it. friends exposed COVID within past couple days, friends berated staying home since March. they've exposed 20+ family members. Really scary stuff. Unfortunately become real directly affects them, feel like that's people handling this. Huh. too. Joy shared doubled, misery shared halved. Maintaining mental health takes energy every day - biggest energy drain denial whole world still is. got invited underground warehouse rave weekend.

Now THAT'S exponential progression yo.
Next week, probably hit around 200k/day. think we're peaking yet point testing capacity limits total new positive count. point spreading way faster scale testing up, anyone authority even trying federal level. Worldometers reports +101,369 new cases, +985 deaths.

Impeached President Donald J. Trump

The Spaghetti Stained Tupperware Colored President. Idaho shit hole b fucking moron. I'll let ride. fear we're going see single week 1 million cases November December. 

The summer peak went low cases around June 11 high six weeks later July 22. 7 day average cases June 11 22,300 July 22 66,630 (327% increase) single-day spikes around 75,000. 

The current wave seems started around September 13 7-day avg 34,425 cases. extrapolating data form last wave, peak wave 327% minimum wave, we'll seeing average 112,565 cases peak days 120,000 single-week estimate 787,000.

But wave seems prolonged slower climb (relatively speaking) compared first two. We're already knocking door 100,000 day. People less compliant mitigation measures. Holiday gatherings cold weather driving people indoors going push us 1 million week. Really cool nick.

Its far important government follows scientific evidence population isnt full uneducated entitled idiots. Every country government took steps control flow people undertake thorough contact tracing managed avoid worst impacts virus.

It’s straightforward. Coronaviruses previously weren’t spread asymptomatic people (think common cold) decision make. tell everyone wear masks healthcare workers would dealing symptomatic carriers may enough PPE people community could quarantine symptomatic. made decision based information available changed recommendations faced new facts. AI model, Subirana stresses, meant diagnose symptomatic people, far whether symptoms due Covid-19 conditions like flu asthma.

Wait, always catch illness related cough? purpose catch ""forced coughs"" asymptomatic illness (including flu)? history repeat stunning widespread growth is, like previous regional outbreaks, almost entire country seeing rapid infection rates. means surge probably sustained much longer previous surges. Add cold weather holidays. Yikes.

Also, 3 million active cases, yet. That's probably least 50K deaths pending. extra expenses justify it? pay vehicle maintenance/fuel? drivers get minimum wage whereas waiters don't?

Are people symptoms come clinic?

Is supply ivermectin sufficient?

Thanks much news! :) Call 100k... Worldometers 99k Nebraska nothing today... 1500 yesterday im fine calling 100k Look us, rounding fucking turn. Trump said it’s going away? Dude. Wait til Mid January. That's gonna shocking compared now. 100k today. Realistically, what's next shitty milestone? 150k? 200k? Quarter million?

I guess I'm trying ask realistically accomplished based testing capacity. Highest number deaths world day since mid April it’s pull trigger destroy economy I’m pulling trigger. cheap ass neighbors tip

It’s neighbors fault employer doesn’t pay employees living wage. Don’t blame them, blame cheap store owner pays slave wages employees. pretty likely vaccine then? Yeah, people won’t get vaccine, enough probably it’ll slow climb rate. 

Maybe February 2025, rate. Quick quick add list accomplishments! 

/s (coz never know) clarify, went top 700+ new cases DAY close 0 100 days.

On second lockdown. top active case number would multi-thousands, probably 10K even worse, cant find stats people virus weeks weeks severly affected.

We 20K cases total (Victorian case totals almost Yeah, Biden wi totally fix it! wonder well would never closed travel China countries. need federal nationwide shutdown, mask mandate. Start putting people jail go essential workers!! realized til now. crazy one asshole charge actually cause disaster. non-hospitalized control group 47% vitamin deficiency. Idk religions encountered Christian church takes collections fund charity church maintenance. charities church members need public need. understand bitter can't blame religion human greed. point US totally mismanaged (cough, POTUS Republicans cough) worst take account positivity rate population sizes. test country currently 6.3 percent tests positive. UK example 7.3 percent positive rate now. Belgium Switzerland 30 percent positive rates There’s lot third world countries food dying. gonna stop eating mail every single piece food? way starve instead? missing?

His model 272k infections day October 5th (uncertainty range 131-516k).

That's 6X rate woldometers Oct 5. think meshes reality. positivity rates would sky high missing many cases day.

Also active cases 5.3 million vs current estimate 3 million.

Doesn't seem good model me, even stopping udpates month ago. I'd say cases taking even quicker model accounts for. They'll right thing till convenient to. deaths. Deaths testing. reading wrong book. Chinese Australian editions may chapters. got replaced with: f*ck, I'm tried this, so... whatever.  well written

it seems like lot country would rather die way life interrupted honestly kind respect Ok still higher totals. don’t give half fuck per capita total still bigger good. moved new jersey little place boonies Pennsylvania, amazed Teenagers trick treating., way different. went people house, came inside, showed costume, least half hour more. Everyone knew there, party animal got 5 houses. remember olden days, bobbing Apple's, making popcorn balls.. might friends over. idea good. Maybe contest spooky picture, draw best moon,,since full moon. got bunch candy bags, laying long table,that's decorated. house, kids little normal belief Presidency going determine pandemic continues weird me. think Biden wins, millions people like wearing masks social distancing going decide starting January 20th? Shit might loner case I'm American alone. I'd far rather beach Mexico beach takeout fairly safe. lol here. Entered college 2008, left 2016, BARELY got job. avocado toast thats issue. Totally me. That's fair, half cases White House alone. like 50,000. Check mate libs /s really. expect 400,000 deaths January. rate that’s going 1,000 2,000 deaths per day month so. ummm many people still trick treating Halloween? 

My spider senses tell lot going beat record next week! There’s decent amount rappers. Lil Pump, Lil Wayne, 50 Cent. one argument hear sars 1 did. sars 2 way new contagious less lethal. Despite similar, behave differently people getting tested maybe? still amount people actually getting Covid. Can’t think another reason NAH BRO, HEAR? PANDEMIC OVER!  people moved goalposts blame Trump WH.

Remember 21 days slow spread order keep hospitals open? Thats enough anymore. coworkers going Halloween parties. don’t understand people. remotely close herd immunity. one cares Per Capita guy  shouldn’t thing become real directly affects them,

That's Republicans general. empathy unless situation personally affects them. 1.5k instagram followers, live big city, went multiple colleges (and currently college-aged, demographic largely super spreaders)... definitely larger social network here.

It's hoax, virus real, I'm dubious numbers distributed. We'r turned corner road straight Yes.  Aaaany moment now... There's still plenty room positivity rate hit 100%. That's limit testing capacity kids school, worrying one holiday everyone already wearing mask outside seems bit silly U  U  Fauci said act far 100k cases day. Right Texas, Arizona, Florida legalized masks cases three hotspots dropped. land dumbasses, home sick. Worldometer us six people IDGAF them. rot makes difference me. stupid, darwin find way. correct thinking America confirming almost 100,000 new cases COVID-19 *every day*? 75k, 80k, 97k new cases...daily. everloving fuck happening there? can't continue. sustainable. bad get people get shit together? mean, Yellowstone might happen, there's couple fault lines west coast due big one almost like raging viruses hard pinpoint something. candidate help Ya Europe looking bad. could preview US.

I think ratio Belgium's population case load yesterday, would like 700k American population. Bold assume testing capacity keep up.    Maybe one day people go morbid jokes actionable change... day!

Imo, problem species world still saved. Whilst still saved, whilst still hope continue fuck around. They’ll probably beat number next week lol  Yeah ever since we've made testing appointment average tests carried hasdropped significantly. people warning case numbers go artificially change remember first press conference, constantly nodding head everything Trump said, remember fake website held since huge amount asskissing, little show rebellion think she'd anything hold position. Active cases, stood 2.5mil whole Sept. new cases per day also old cases leaving quarantine hospitals day. 500k active cases throughout Oct. 3kk active cases / 31days \* 0.16 needs hospital bed \* 0.18 need ICU \* 0.45 die ICU. Looks right. Yay get Darwin award right?
Or hit 1 million per day?
Taking bets? [looks like 101k Holy shit. People literally risking lives, health well-being vote. That's important everyone right now. That’s amazing news💀💀💀 242,379 not, nobody onboard except fools. fools take seriously. Who? sad Dr. Fauci, man Trump trying discredit, already [told day coming.

trump already blames biden coronavirus response Yeah nah mate. NT Australia we're golden. 0 deaths, 0 locally transmitted cases whopping 39 cases we've come either interstate overseas. think joe biden going cancel Christmas insane.  See? Look yourself. That's... something else. catch straight-up disassociating next week Sorry you. Sending positive thoughts grandma. province 4.37 million people 622 cases today, per capita stack up?

148 per per million

Your area twice good compared USA. go store yesterday one weekly trip. 75% store wearing masks social distancing. 

We longer ventilators available beds state full. It’s almost like people don’t care anymore? don’t think folks understand germ theory maybe wanna roll dice, Covid still wear mask. don’t want again, bad enough. yet, still go shitty retail job like it’s big deal. They’ve decided deaths worth two one special! Jesus, going world record what? Oh wait... Per capita, adjusted US population, European countries broke barrier last week. make better, puts perspective. Lol nationwide shutdown Amish? Lmao. Life isn’t anime bro. Calm down. think pick China. infatuation America Europe getting wrecked? Yes asia great people act like Trump person causing havoc Covid. get tested. way nobody infected. ^/s fuck wrong America? could number way lower everyone wore masks went out, ffs. Nope.

The sudden change views first wave ""complete breakdown truth"".

It's numbers screen projections linked show Canada passing U.S total would post graph, can't post images here, can't post elsewhere subreddit.  gets control happen. infections grow, grow exponentially. 100s cases easy track case epidemic control.

Europe connected alone Germany's fault. doors open neighbors coughing kinda shitty place. Germany middle Europe plenty doors.  ""We rounding virus."" ""We testing much. test, cases get."" ""Fake news."" 😡 CDC [has IFR values Covid-19 age-specific estimates, low 0.003% 0–19 years, 0.02% 20–49 years, 0.5% 50–69 years, 5.4% 70+ years. totally crashes healthcare system mortality rates go 0.6% 3%. 350 million Americans 9 million dead.  lmao still voting trump xx Give 10 seconds someone mention NZ Infections projected site, along ones, assumed REAL cases. can't possibly find every positive Covid case, always under-testing. greater interest 'cases' trendline. site projected numbers end October slightly higher peak last reached July. appears spot on. deaths, undercount problem, projected 800 deaths per day (averaged week) end October, 10% bottom. looks quite accurate. Yeah, much screw nature up, sure show us who's boss times... interesting thing, US maintained infection rate 100k new cases day, probably continue rise, even doubled, would still take approx. 4.75 - 9.5 YEARS, burn US population. 

Now remember, worldwide, seeing spikes coming winter months. 

There 7.8 Billion people planet. think covid going problem while, even year in, people completley forgotten spread actually still relatively small, still MUCH room exponential growth curve swing vertically. champions champions 1. deaths instantaneous. compare today's death total case count 3 weeks ago
2. treatments better flying blind
3. nursing homes vulnerable protected seen happened spring
4. doctors nurses experience
5. testing found minor cases waiting headline news “US cases declining effective vaccines increasing number mask wearing” Ok civil unrest plague bingo card. Cases per capita right aren't. Europe lotttt worse. Fear mongering prepend outline.com/ URL. headline every day? decrease people take measures. failing tout best tactic - prevention! Duh - prevent lung cancers smoking, prevent transmissions wearing mask.. prevent Type 2 Diabetes eating many sugar laden products. Prevention much cost efficient cure, especially since many people skeptical vaccines. addition, trials run realities vaccine trials. Trump proclaims mean come fruition. promised vaccine election day... Wake reality. People dying astronomical rates continue people follow common sense guidelines. Yeah - drive drunk, wear seat belt, wear helmet drive motorcycle. Yeah, we'd probably done Halloween candy hunt moved new house March (yay moving pandemic, fun) yards landscaped yet, dirt :/ Xi jing ping Ah yes ""Russia Russia Russia Power Hour"", reputable news source already lost integrity physician moment decided keep silent man told Americans inject bleach drink fish tank cleaner, partly responsible shit show lending credentials doctor ravings insane man. refusing correct either silence pushing vague propaganda messages, complicit. I'm getting spirit ready blinding flash atomic death. Yea...first October haven’t watched single scary movie. enough inflate number 1.7 million???  Thank you. sort shit corner this? really wish map showed hospitalizations county level, haven’t encountered detailed one yet.

But website show hospitalizations [by region [absolute [per death cultist promoting value system terrorist, mass death event actually fine, serves political ideology, nothing saving Trump's ego. current wave probably peak til flu season peak February Sounds like enjoying life pretty miserable right now. plan staying locked house another year vaccine distributed immunity built up? 8.2 years herd immunity! country crossing 10k cases day 17 million people. Much much worse US. Well least you’re 93% vampire. back square 1 pretty soon, Europe clearly shown see. Thanks clearing up. see WH reporting note much trying+failing cover up? Easy Joe Mccarthy wonder we’ve hit didn’t know it. I’ve seen false positives (Indianapolis Colts weeks ago) opposite must true people test negative actually it.

The whole thing confuses worries someone immune compromised mother older grandmother.

I find urge daily want yell people aren’t wearing masks.

What crazy year 2020 been. Hopefully come space colonies something like end January. Education socialist. your* shity thing is, people realize fast damn thing spreads, especially indoors. I've seen firsthand ravage community, spreads like wildfire. Oof.. would hate disingenuous. confirm. pourly edjukated. aware free antibody testing. looked months ago, everyone charging around $120. furloughs limited hours, save much possible. Also, January. Everything I've read suggests I'm unlikely still carry antibodies. believe also cell test, though. 🥳🎉🎈 idea control virus stupid, control environment virus exists. Chinese effective control environment ie population. freedoms many west cherish direct contradiction many controls necessary reduce transmission. Take pick Gen Z's &amp; millennials. way year going, surprised lost hour weekend DST can't nice things. Way go! india threatened #1 spot fought back kept it! America #1 America #1! Definitely years. probably already 500k infections day Us. get 1.5 millions so, won’t take long. Thats honestly bad, considering caused global pandemic. Actually new deaths lower 1% new cases since people dying instantly new cases rising every day. worse I'm saying. It’s blunt.. it’s ignorant statement. It’s fear tactic. doesn’t work. 


And get downvoted “trump lover” voted independent. (Which reason gets much hate) Please go vote. Probably combination things. Better treatments, widespread testing, everyone getting diagnosed early given access treatment (remember February thru April almost impossible get tested countries unless returned country high cases?), young people getting infected older / high risk people adjusted behaviour accordingly. I'll sure call CDC let know CFBOverNFL, guy 1,500 followers Instagram, doubts accuracy reporting.  Well think proves it. rounded corner. already used screw driver wound back odometer, put sawdust tank. Look, nation runs like champ now, she’s got 500 miles her! Correct, HHS. States separate reporting systems cases deaths. Hospitals simultaneously report multiple systems. also stop state messing numbers. Speaking which, gotta give Nascar credit season they've handled pandemic. PGA well. idea worst places I’m sorry. grand child ever bury grandparent. right thing. times like boggles mind reasonable person would attend public event lots people. Stay strong hang there. fake people testing positive? Thank feedback. whole family tested least likely person believe false positive since rest us negative including son symptoms. World champs! France us equivalent 200k day now. could see happening US. positive tests/ tests Buckle up, kids... knew coming, today... are. 

Stay safe, wear mask, don’t complacent. still ramp-up. it’s like musical chairs, death. media get correct numbers?  watched first time today (while working home) always gotta #1, fucking embarrassing Gave back upvote. Lol Ok well I’m gonna good time happens hospitals beds people need help? people could survived treatment, go home bed already taken? 

And that’s even consider people don’t covid need help. Get car wreck, every ICU bed full covid patient? One person isn’t getting treatment require. 

That’s what’s big deal. percentage people tested COVID-19 return “positive”’result, meaning virus. It’s rate instead nominal number, prevents people saying “there’s positive tests testing more!”. think new positives important percent positive anyways, no? someone tests positive still positive week shouldn’t treated new positive case.

Thank you. I’ve saying MONTHS everyone sub wants believe bad FL seventh pit CV hell can’t use brains think critically numbers reported way. numbers come daily completely transparent methodology. Uh, they'd dense say they've done literally \*anything\* might end it.

They done less nothing. tell getting tired WINNING I’m Michigan. Need say more? Love governor “muh freedoms” seem winning. I’m worried there’s much do. Plus internationally, number tests per 1M population top 20. Yeah, making U-turn makes wonder learn first wave? everyone forget? beat once, again? virus can't order advise coordinate states health agencies take appropriate actions. media US controlled White House.

Unlike majority European countries, numbers filtered government... Indeed. optimistic view...then USA completely fucked initial response, politicizing pandemic. Instead banding together like movie, say, Independence Day. 

Final shred optimism: gone could also throw candy surprised people used Excel database COVID cases also decided store daily cases 17-bit integer. Good news vaccine, potentially. Greatest president every... breaking records one another Ok let get straight... telling one day, 100k positive cases covid ? thing really came back aggressive much?? heard, got significantly better treating disease figuring survive home rather hospital. thought anything 10% “ideal”? Opened Snapchat saw insane amount people Halloween parties. unreal winter going awful. friends throw awesome Halloween party every year, last year fun I'd since graduated.

They canceled year instead I'm inviting friend we're making tacos. We're also single, childless, work home, tested negative last week.

I remember back August bars mill near tempe started reopening. got picture friend near campus CASA full capacity, least 150 people. lost hope humanity then.

And Hi east chandler! Yeah get sarcastic comment, don’t people report figures rates (namely, hospitalization rate)?

It prevents entire argument. jr said corona over? mean conservatives lied? I’m sorry.  Sunday 100,000+. I'm sure corner rounding. Japan admittedly adopted policy artificially raising positivity rate placing triage step *before* testing belief test accuracy utmost importance. want test people likely infected Covid-19 something else like bad cold flu. also happens policy seem slightly lower number cases get reported definitely politically expedient.

But Japan's scale spread vs US, cares. We're turning corner alright, wrong direction. old Hollywood plots sell anymore. like plots dark days report 75k deaths got unreported summer, totals never modified reflect new information. We're already 300k confirmed.

I've saying since beginning, proving true; worse pandemic gets less information we'll it. MOCO checking in. Definitely seems like we're part tell about. local giant shaming one guy publicly tried shop without mask. Seeing lot around here. explain people bullet holes heads counted deaths covid? He's probably planning trying declare COVID bankruptcy. Whatever fuck might be. Yet still don’t know 1 person got Fire police force replace job ENFORCING LAW. worldometers.info, .com Seems like USA really wants keep Canadian border closed long time. would leave Midwest now. Seriously. miss “old normal” —prior January 20, 2017. It’s never ideal (in administration), least didn’t wake chaos, skullduggery, toddler-in-chief... Unlikely. Vaccine rollout throughout country take months. Perhaps vaccine ready select March, means majority wait much longer that.  That’s like saying “no one needs wear seatbelt, drive carefully follow rules road.” 

It’s reality people won’t follow rules. Contagion turning documentary point. 2020 would year... Two places arse end world.

Europe can't lock way amount land trade borders. easy isolate crew container ship going AU/NZ, tens thousands lorries go major European countries every day, even UK island.

If even positive makes difficult completely eliminate Covid, especially neighbours good job containing it. Remember Italy hit like 100k total cases everyone preparing apocalypse? Lol much freedoms catch corona dead wrong. could possibly disagree more.

Fuck every last Trumper, fuck every last conservative, fuck every motherfucker entire right half political spectrum worldwide.

These people willfully ignorant, evil, selfish beyond measure. Every single one.

They're dead weight species they're holding us back, actively dragging us costing lives.  Mission accomplished Nope, part leader blames doctors attributing death covid death. see least 500,000 dead dumb people wake up. Check citations.... assuming even find info came from. LET'S FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO Yeah I’ve met folks state... dealing absurd situation entirely different contexts. buy island live entire respective countries decide act like adults.

You can't ways, Oliver either trustworthy source saw plates affair. lie Joe sex minors. Pick one, either way mormonism loses.

BTW, Helen Mar Kimball one thinking about. 14 pervert Joseph Smith (age 37 time) coerced marriage promising eternal salvation family. Ain't way true number way higher. Maybe 2-3 million infected ? Probably testing already really sick People, need go plane week... hate life. Comrade, everyone feels way disabled. Stay strong. yet, hoax vanish like magic.

oy. Fucking insane thinking long took hit initial 100,000 cases correct. average person Reddit clue deaths flat trend-line since beginning June continued usage masks increasing decreasing, lockdowns going effect lifted, etc. Deaths staying “new cases” stat fake statistic indicative true number current infections country. “New cases” people getting tested positive, it’s completely possible stat rise overall number cases (which always magnitudes larger) going opposite. might, suspect others march death. actually ever worse.  funny tho? 

lol used thing added end every sentence...Now I'm fucking terrified open reddit. Sorry feel like I'm giving hope. Russia, quite countries working tear US.

I don’t believe did. family immigrated Eastern Europe... although I’m American, strong appreciation countries. point Germany France imposing level lockdowns now... question, what’s US doing? national level? Nothing. 

Other nations previously looked US powerful nation. Now... debatable estimated count new daily infections per 100,000 people (even counting asymptomatic undiagnosed cases) is:

The US: 52.61

Japan: 2.91 10% horrible levels. 5% inexcusable regardless many active cases have. far in. big corner up. Ugh gonna fucking annihilate stock market come Monday  issue that’s lots people it. Yeah....I feel like slowly sinking boat everyone ignoring captain telling move lifeboats. ""Influenza Positive Tests... SEPTEMBER 29, 2019""

🤦‍♂️ stitch time saves nine. Shoot curbside now-may drive employee walking car wear masks much better restaurant BaaaaAaaaaaaa  Vietnam island. South Korea. Wawawewa Lol you’re implying equal necessity handing candy strangers kids getting gas buying food? high bro? live like first three months 5 I’m 99% sure would killed slipped back heroin addiction good folks. Atleast go gym /s That’s simply works. isn’t debate. It’s statistics. high number tests per 100,000/million citizens representative population whole. country enough tests test symptomatic citizens, course it’s going high percent positivity.

Country 1 million citizens 1000 tests available. tests symptomatic risk patients, public health officials notice aren’t many. finds 300 people positive 1000 tests. That’s percent positivity 30%.

Country B also 1 million citizens. 1 million tests available test everyone (not works real life exactly let’s pretend). finds 30,000 people positive. That’s percent positivity 3%.

Country 30% positive. Country B 3% positive. country B 100x cases. Country B far worse.

Granted, isn’t case time, may even case Mexico. point percent positivity good measure severity lots testing done general population, symptomatic at-risk people. Anecdotally, people seem - least generally area - wearing masks 'trying' socially distant public. think lot damage done private. think even still people view COVID disease 'other people' have, within social circles adhere social distancing mask use stringently. Honor association, let guard Uncle Jim reputation precedes would never put us danger.

Death rate hospitalization rate lowest they've ever makes sense. 230k Americans dead, upset reddit comments going far right? Every single death responsibility Anyone lends expertise Trump administration sacrificing principles gets respect me. Fauci critisizing government response entire time. Good choice Unfortunately it’s speedometer full 360. i'd *like* say hate denial fact

People local grocery wearing masks all. want scream them, help whole airborne particles spread screaming back.. Full Moon halloween morning year.. go figure!

Stay safe. ""BUT MAH FREEDUMB!?!??!"" Recheck math bud. though dumb research least they'll wear masks Jeezus, there's cold hard perspective. 6 % covid associated deaths covid factor according CDC. Never ending

Seasonal. Like endemic coronavirii. Let’s arbitrarily say 30 million US citizens already infected. would still take around 200 days hit 210 million infected threshold rate 1 million day hit 70 percent herd immunity. would take us till around mid April get zero vaccines.

There emergency vaccine approved then, I’m sure doctors nurses hold long. Either way see something 500k-600k casualties then. Honestly, fuck them. They're willing let parents loved ones die fox news whatever conservative media gave idea. They're absolutely awful people that. Almost yeah, nothing stopping true individual day virus spreading faster mean tomorrow's? Great joke! one came totally wit?

Yes, can. could easily afford it. America doesn't' care poor people. never has. never will. Yeah specifically said northern hemisphere North America. No, report reality. wanted support really quick. There’s 10k cases 330m Americans. That’s .003%. honestly scary shows much worse get time infections deaths. Also doctors getting better treating Covid patients.

Yeah, stopped panic-using ventilators killing people causing lung damage. friend way drunk drove home made it. Well kind explained personally may many friends know anyone Covid. 101,000 reported cases know. Yea tough you’ll fine neighbor started ""trump country"" sign 10ft front door. almost right curb. hilarious see inch closer closer road past weeks. theres 10 different spots, progressively closer. think helped guy next also put one out. theyre emboldened others stupidity, ignorance hate

up couple weeks ago, didnt see trump signs anywhere around here. popped nowhere seems. theres huge homemade painted TRUMP TWO TERMS 2020 banner street thats clearly painted children. another ""we love trump trump loves america"" right past one. second one, stole design [these substituted place typed 'love'. clearly passive agressive shot neighbors right next them, actual ""hate home here"" signs yard.

this whole thing shit show honestly dont know people wake walk outside every morning thinking theyre right side history. like two different realities point Trump might burn white house leave. said ""meh"" 🤷‍♂️ Neighbor stay inside limit risk scared it, let others play game We're hitting 100,000 day we're probably halfway current wave. People inside cold weather. People tired wearing masks distancing. Family gatherings happening cause can't happen us. We're going see week 1 million cases Thanksgiving Christmas. considering testing amount. Interesting thought said many times, it’s flu. Can’t really compare. Sad true. Theres going back imo, theres many cases circulation even population government change.

Its going ravage US till Vaccine widely availabile. much easier control virus created. think cities states across country start shutting long gets 250k per day. get wrong, get really bad, bad. worst incremental game ever played Period, end.

The death rate proves otherwise. fine, promise needs Thanksgiving modern version Guns (riots/shootings) Germs (Covid-19) Steel (Steel jobs lost)? Mexico's testing shit? middle income countries fine testing. Hell, Iraq testing shitload more. Lol think 2020 finale?

They say anything 2020 finale human suffering. said next two months going worst year plagued (pun intended) bad events. Herd immunity would leave millions dead decimate world economy. absolutely delusional. afraid facts data? interchangeable 

bigots like want difference certainly true--- everyone choose get test.

i agree, percent positive one metric..but unfortunately failproof metrics trailing indicators leading ones.  Russian roulette doesn’t kill grandmother roll wrong. vast majority comorbidities listed death certificates Covid symptoms?  get pneumonia respiratory failure chronic heart Keep mind figures today result people infected last week two. going get lot worse.

Right? idiots think companies pay employees profits increase, exact opposite. find ways increase profits even keeping labor costs same. That's pretty much expected it? flu generally affects 5-20% population every year example. know flu, would 10% 5% horrible inexcusable? ""positivity rate"" something else? I'm worried still people think know flu still choosing wander around makes things worse everyone else, since already done Covid-19.  Christ I'm tired sucking much.  Whatever trying avoid locking going happen now. consequences playing us. Like train slow motion knowing way gonna happen Less road construction Suck freeze! Yet.

US relatively easy immigrate to, it’s first choice nations receptive. beginning approach ceiling healthcare system handle. Together, spring, push curve avoid strain healthcare,” Chief Epidemiologist Anders Tegnell told news conference.

Will Sweden end top ten deaths per capita worldwide continues? even 100k new cases day, would take almost 10 years every person US get infected. I’m betting finally blink week so. time wine make cold dark lonely winter...

Last Vegas shooting, started parking outside major concerts public events. politically easier 'better' deal dozens dead bodies crying families fix deep problem nation business built around.  measures needed early pandemic followed, that's virus got control. much winning!!! rate 2%... coming around corner 2k deaths day soon here. remember estimating max quarter million deaths time everyone vaccinated 2021-2022. Never wildest dreams think nothing, literally nothing, would done federal govt stop this. infuriating great! I’ve seen couple cool things like posted upper middle class area Arizona rigs seem seen unnecessary. Gee, can’t imagine national hotspot since almost day one...

Because tread folks wear masks public .

If everyone mask on, handing candy big deal. 


Phoenix here. Handing candy. 5% less it’s recommended schools open person learning, benefit outweighs risk. It'll close think I'd expect see 10M cases first much. No. Fuck weird enabling rant. Also fuck you. Seriously fuck you. think interacting whomever following guidelines ok are? think ok "" proper PPE""? sprayed AIDs would ok Amazon 12 6 $ mask on? fuck wouldn't. preach insane idea optimal situation wearing proper PPE would enough fucking know damn well encounter day day situations ""optimal"" fuck need fucking isolate. need fucking lay back EVERYTHING make EVERY case Covid manageable. sit tell psychological issues isolation. like deprevation chambers. fucking 2020 fucking Skype anyone day everyday. can't manage insane bullshit attitude every fucking moron feels ""my rights"" important people's fucking lives.

Granted current cases caught border isolation, still, felt like smart way it. hassle, drama. dunno, could see missing majority cases. Lot people infected feel I'll effects all. likely getting tested. Many people feel little sick, bad enough go get tested. 

I'd imagine part people tested definitely come contact infected people people concerned symptoms. Mmm.....the long rest. ;) course, there's upper limit this.

If ICU's get totally, totally full. hospitals start turning away patients. really matter good doctor treating get see doctor.

We still interested flattening curve. There's lot thoughting prayering We're certainly turning corner going nowhere revisiting original corner worse situation.

Whatever political views may be, admit trump sound mentally. epitome greed, selfishness, evil wrapped together. people across world sees Trump, leader free world, star follow; views spread around world.

Do give in. Love neighbor. would leave 75 million people high risk death... even responding right person? original comment saying basically time leave house need curbside pickup groceries. going one home thy also distancing heavily. irritated many around reckless partner getting pretty sick making sure part keeping community safe nobody else around us is. So...not sure you’re even responding pneumonia, rona...not dead. Hospitals get paid much per corona death? 

Heart disease 655000 deaths year. worried eat, especially south. Also feel worth time juncture. Adios Maybe meant: turning corner, worst. serious note, increase chances novel strain appear due genetic drift? Coming country positivity rate 0.3%, 7% seems pretty fucking terrifying. Maybe corner round about? Oh, staying 1000 deaths day reckon? 


\[x\] Doubt Yes totally fine don’t care politics, free speech oppression minorities.

The general idea pushing narrative we're gonna die bad man voted white house.  town. We're told hand candy yet tell us leave bowl out. So, supposed hand candy out? think cancelled trick treating. tell parents suck go store buy kids candy there. Fewer tests, 20% increase cases vs 10/23. good. ...and are, gathering masses go get candy strangers. Sorry folks could come house get candy, reason it, stingy... first part implied bud, we’re math head. 1/3 population, 100k total vs 100k day, yep get it. Waiting ya turn corner corner ya realized awhile back even though lucky enough work home rarely leave house except groceries, really matter much girlfriend works full-time retail job big box store. front line every day. could safe possible likely way reaches us people works around. I'd lying told I've completely avoided seeing family occasionally throughout past months, I'm sure 99% people well. Don’t listen idiots sub. everyone idiot ones idiots vocal. you. 

I’ve living life cautiously still living. many people know real life (many know vocal sub) like loudly criticize things even slightly social, like eating lunch outside family member. Heaven forbid. Meet small group friends also generally cautious always wear masks? I’m literally devil.

These Karen’s part reason get opposite reaction never wear mask never socially distance. winter lasted 600 days... sure could add 500k deaths Yup. One 9/11 every 3 days so. number places never lockdown mostly (not completely) returned normal albeit masks. 
The problem it’s strengthened CCP’s hand enormously domestically region. Yeah, that's meant, phrase right, edit Saw Brett Favre also endorsing Trump. I'd argue US country responsible US's failure. Herd immunity leave millions dead. really something wait for. Oh, response included, ""Grandma Grandpa always said they'd rather die see family!""

I told alright, stay grandparents' house they'd continue seeing leave interact outside world got COVID together either recovered died without spreading outside world. they're absolutely going stores, shopping, attending church, etc. Zero precautions. Knowing they've exposed. 

It therapeutic call selfish worst representation Christianity imagine (probably worst insult could deliver) promptly block life. honestly relieving done. nature job hopping also made worse. compensation based hitting quarterly/annual goals, lot people cut corners hit goals, use resume, bounce long term impact cut corners realized. Whenever apply job, check LinkedIn pages executives company. show ton company run. 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 TIL understanding complex metric things effect nuance beside “high means bad” mental gymnastics. guess it’s apt though, need mentally strong brain understand complexities form informed opinion. That's extremely conservative considering saw beginning Pandemic.  U.S stands U.S Sucks Herd immunity never reached without vaccine. None. postpone infections, closer get vaccine better get treating this, matter months. even touch people die without covid let things rip hospitals run capacity. America First ! always It’s America fucked. Australia, lockdowns accompanied government stimulus. America can’t afford said stimulus herd immunity you. 1 million Americans die xmas 21. Maybe time rethink country run. Seriously, now? zero qaulifications job causing thousands Americans die. University got degree denounce least protect credibility? honestly thought president entire country, would (and should) mandate steps battle pandemic. least, got State leaders page... alas...

Our country (even two waves) total 0.1% infection rate, whereas America 2.8% infection rate - 28 TIMES higher!!!

We also hard lockdowns self-isolation mask-wearing mandates (with $6,000+ on-the-spot fines following rules). point easily contact tracing new cases appear. even testing waste water sewage plants detect unknown sources/hot-spots.

Even 13x population, infection rate 26x worse per capita, fatality rate 19x worse per capita.

...and retarded idea wearing mask inhibiting ""freedom"". Well happened. Today. like failed businessman president.  Interesting timing. Wait 933 deaths one day?? Grocery store town complete prime rib kit like $100, think year Whaaaaaat amazing! Thanks idea Second wave? thought still first... Similar tests per million UK:

UK: 492,175

US: 431,030

Twice number confirmed cases per million:

UK: 14,554

US: 28,091 great! think anyone know ever died car accident, must happen either care saving lives, recognize literally every single country successfully contained pandemic relied technology surveillance so. Would trade loss privacy preventing millions deaths? wait thing mutates something starts wrecking people even worse. knew turn going up, instead downs 

Trump 5head Lol 800k per year salary, I'd imagine tolerate it. Jokes us! heard Covid finished USA! 

If that's year trick, what's treat? Along anyone place past 8 months pretty much every person america. think going grocery store gas station less chance transmission passing Halloween candy? emotional attachment one other. fair, nearly 20 years since 9/11 Patriot Act still thing. I'll take downvotes you. I'm suuuuper skeptical ""reports"". There's way deaths. bullshit. New Years Cries Belgian wife tested positive today. Stay safe everyone.  Nice big companies like Nestle Coca-Cola license pump water ground resell fucking place. I'm sure they'll let people need it, right? already told parents would pre-thanksgiving way bringing infant house 30 people over. way. 

They weren’t particularly happy understood. I’ve read, Texas state law doesn’t allow counties shut individually. judges order illegal use line superhero movie something. 101k today, definitely long wait. do, really can't expect 16 year olds interested enough give damn retain information longer required pass exam Crazy hard Europe US floundering. So... things literally worse ever been... we're going create super spreader seed ships? I'm tired winning happens reality meets bunch dumb motherfuckers. unlike really care call it.

I care call it. However, refusal call second wave example deceptive statements made beginning.

For example, April 18 Tegnell claimed number cases plateaued reality ""plateau"" actually artificially created intentionally low numbers tests performing - knew it.

He claims strategy herd immunity, private emails prove herd immunity part ""planning"" right start. even forced admit possible end epidemic Sweden (given refusal pursue elimination strategy) either naturally induced artificial herd immunity.

Then claimed immunity (dropping word ""herd"" obvious reasons) reason Sweden would see lower case numbers neighbours, would likely even second wave.

I go on...

On one hand Swedish people follow recommendations law, recommendations include wearing mask would ignore recommendations would make things worse.

On one hand reason Sweden's strategy works consistent, without chopping changing suit current situation, hand different regions need different rules cope different conditions different times national rules option.

Over over, Tegnell's ""truth"" turns whatever needs defend statement making celebrate increased number cases

Pathetic. never celebrated increased number cases. fact trying point action needs taken prevent increase.

Unfortunately thanks people like you, forced point **is** increased number cases simply Tegnell's defenders refused believe obvious truth (and still do).

The reason concern Tegnell keeping bullshit Sweden. promoting world.

He even advised UK government increase restrictions second wave began hit... look got them...

Tegnell danger Sweden. was, care much do. actively criticising nations done much better his, advising nations go insane path chose. collapse united states

Finally. enough people vote. Easter?! comments satire yall serious? Thank thank you. may come elsewhere first, actually think came independently here. stupid fucking people would follow rules refuse believe real life. I'm 99.9% certain bizarre simulation point. No. Wearing mask helps. US, number cases presently increasing rate 70 cases per minute, 1.2 new cases every 1 second. number new cases per minute increasing minute. number cases per day reaches 200,000, 140 cases per minute, 2.3 new cases every second, number cases minute second predictably continue increasing reaching 140/min, 2.3/sec, end sight around ""corners"".

I presented much factual data OP did, FYI. *First last

2020 leaving one alive rate Science rules. BILL BILL BILL BILL. Inertia property matter. BILL BILL BILL BILL. Whats fyking point. BILL BILL BILL BILL. Yes. I’m glad listened episode. needed attitude adjustment. don’t get user still allowed post here. he/she post “articles” unknown Dutch website zero credibility. everyone eats like candy. get that. friends something different, would feel really lame stuck home. feel like many parents best can, good intentions. lived great area (adjacent active drug dealing prostitution area) 8 remember trick treating neighborhood (I think gone relatives friends houses?), parents always made fun. moved different area, went around neighborhood every year. blamed south Dakota? mean we’re going eventually get it? what's over/under tomorrow?

r/sportsbook set porch today. even decorated green paint, webs spiders. really hoping kids it. We're making 2021 lol much infection ok say , ""fuck it"". go herd immunity/ survival fittest? Sounds like you’re one people blame many people died far. 50k twenty percent positivity God damn winter gonna suck someone told year movie plot would say there's way crazy even movie don’t understand guys want do? Shut entire country forever? It’s bad virus. 

If virus really bad, let’s say 20-30% kill rate, think would need people preaching wear masks stay in? No. Shit would never leave house vaccine came out.

The fact people going daily lives tell panic isn’t really founded. Nope.   Eventually many people get virus become immune never catch it. might remind president fucking moron? nobody mention China? They’re island, back normal months, economy well. last presidential debate (and first) Donald Trump claimed weeks away vaccine even go far. give two shits first amendment know is. followers don’t blame him. eyes Chinese us saved 2 million lives. want math:

0-19: 3 100,000 
20-40: 20 100,000 
50-69: 500 100,000 
70+: 5,400 100,000 G-d Bless America Basically zero.

Even half population skips, it’s still hell bomb.

Especially since it’ll cold many places comfy outdoors. Things gonna get bad. People probably gonna die violently donny loses starts fomenting violence Q dumbfucks cuz want spend rest life litigation hopefully prison. standing [coroner](http://explosm.net/comics/3173/). Fucking trickle economics. ""If peasants keep giving cash elite, they'll share us kindness hearts everybody wins!"" Jfc.... Hey, big motorcycle convention also?  101k new people positive one day. deaths meanwhile people. lag people infected weeks month ago takes people die infected. yet see resulting deaths 101k today. thing schools opening California State said school's responsibility keep safe providing additional funding PPE, testing, substitutes teachers get sick, etc. administrator scruples likely open going cold flu season budgetary reasons well common sense. Sonoma County checking in, spouse 3rd grade teacher here.  give idea! Is...this joke? honestly can’t tell joke idiot garbage human it’s little impressive you’ve mastered typing Growing \~20% week week. appreciable action mitigate spread across much country, next Friday likely \~120k \~140k Friday 13th. !remindme one month I’m buying Popeyes fried turkey.

For wife I.  reddit? Go back time prevent Covid King America elected What's country doing? Cases skyrocketing way faster Europe. Illinois Governor free reign, state various stages restriction. Chicago suburbs people wearing masks months school 100% online. Still cases climb. **Today Illinois reported higher number new cases us state.**

So please spare bs one party fault. Illinois 100% run democrats currently leading nation new covid-19 cases.   It’s sad. Like real life sad. Usually BBC. couple instance last couple months cluster cases found areas thought eradicated. reported response shut travel area, conduct 100% testing door door necessary, quarantine anyone tests positive release people get 100% testing complete quarantine period expired. heavy handed response, true, getting plenty test coverage know common asymptomatic cases are. 6 figures babayyyyy Falling Upwards. That's probably least 50K deaths pending.

Probably 10-15,000ish range remembering rates right, makes feel better. death rate significantly 1% Can't wait hit frat houses tomorrow!  *pat pat*

I know you’re trying

*pat pat* rOuNdInG cURvE but, come lick you? Actually believe OC43 caused Russian Flu Epidemic 1889 severe acute respiratory infection may mislabeled flu. See genetic testing found crossed cows humans around then. 

It caused severe disease like Coronavirus, spread cities like mad killing millions probably. epidemics caused lasted couple years began settle roll endemic Coronavirus. causes mild infections many us probably it. 

You see virus deadly novel initially one immunity it. build immunity infection vaccination virus likely settle endemic roll mild moderate Coronavirus. facts data real, context made scare, inform. new ""wave"" occuring areas like South Dakota little cases before. stands reason virus spreads interior rural parts country, cases rise areas, especially complacent thought avoided problem. 

The article many like make seem country whole experiencing rapid rise cases, imaging pending exponential growth repeat NY March. 

Yet saw thing occur sunbelt June-July things eventually plateaued. Paid Hillary Clinton. imagine would happen another covid type virus different one also bad emerges next year? Mom? Bullshit. I'm world everyday, albeit delivering shit, ""nazis goddamn street"" stop spreading garbage. Mask up, wash hands, isolate fine. Acting like end world ridiculous. going provide receipts claim. That's cute think omnipotent/efficient power USA actually ""reallocate focus resources hard-hit areas"". get public relations things like 10 nurses whatever x city/state help city/state, that's essentially irrelevant reality look numbers. power anything? Certainly seems like puts power Twitter shittalking Biden. Hasn’t done shit. Indiana hospitals predicted overwhelmed Beginning December Thanksgiving... Peak New Years... every one vote 1918 says no. Trump administration’s plan literally get everyone infected. LITERALLY said exactly that. 1000 dead day, 3rd largest killer US BAD.

That's simple is. live Oregon border eastern part everyone masked around Washington. Tri-Cities endoscopy couple days ago. Lots cars restaurants though understand. I'm convinced 2021 even worse. 3 months holiday months. cases it'll bring make 2020 sneak peek real event I've covid. Trust me, worth risking. 6 months later, still symptoms.  try. Re: IHME model, thing models they’re like quantum physics/particles shit – observation fucks outcome. mean “irresponsibility gaslighting government linked psychological wellbeing” — sounds right I'm lost words. caught COVID sick way. started working remotely early got laid early. also eight months life wiped COVID crisis long one hiring competent leadership ending pandemic, that's going get worse. guess I’m asking is, media show genuine attitude majority cops? fair say cops evil discriminatory feelings like psycho cops media showing tv? USA! USA! USA! worry guys WH said ended covid good. open window ah 35 million time wear mask either heads Easy fix via ideas logistics. get way. 3 million confirmed cases? estimate based entire population? want see grim possibilities, projections USA.   
January 1st, 2021 350K Cases/Day - 2200 Deaths/Day. Ironically, London ONE case today. seniors get covid flu time unprecedented danger even treatment improved think posted anti lockdown party ?

I remember that...had good laugh end, Trump promote sphincter Head Task Force? Oh? Ugh, thank you! attention span shit today went look got distracted come back. appreciated! happened Ain't jesus we're going surprise, president days work harder spread virus contain it. What's ""down time"" speak 80% polish participants small study did. Depends time year passed 101,000 Nebraska reported. Fuck, man. end year  101,024

Ridiculous. since trump give less shit lame duck period, surprised 300k dead jan 20th, maybe even 350k even higher nothing vs 3 weeks new year Oh need look busy, busy. takes much harder effort amount work much harder focus home Well guys looks like it. 101k cases. Fuck genuinely think we'd reach 100k today. There's God anymore. covid. Might simply weather. getting colder, people start spend less time outdoors, inside. I'll alert media. Generally public health experts get stage talk smack. Professionalism different toadyism. Thats great idea too. addition, also build special prisons camps send violators contaminate prisoners sickness. case, objectively wrong declaring that. Again, think misspoke relates CDC releasing official info asymptotic spread. take one comment context either way Georgia's success far everyone said we'd horrible failure. glad White House listed ending Covid-19 pandemic achievement. Nothing see here. /s 100k according worldometers. guys!  australia, isreal (right wing) family, probably helpful protectors. family, (middle class African American male) much. they, defend fellows breaking laws supposed uphold? Dum da dum dum dummmm states like Michigan, Ohio Wisconsin state republicans handcuffed governors can’t lock even wanted too. Lol says guy taking side, part problem. think people will, promoting idea reddit one comply something would wanted undermine citizens efforts work together. 101 worldmeter yall dont get thanks trump theres 229,000 americans dont ever worry COVID again. else want!?! Stay safe everyone. Sending love encouragement Melbourne. need something like Germany. Thought read shutting businesses actually supporting too. solid idea. mean, birx fauci even there, hell Trump one months what's point even them. like anyone taking notes One-third (33.9%) **Spanish population** may risk **Vitamin deficiencyies**. guys. :( New world record!!!! 
Even without Olympics USA still breaking records
/s EYYYYY BOIS HERE!!! White House said it’s gone!! Wow let’s mention individuals hospitalized means afford bill. Potentially setting back years financially... aboard doom train!  


Feeling like ride cannot get off, want off. Fauci say would hit it? ""we're rounding curve""

""people learning live virus"" close schools non-essential businesses get cases back control, minimum lockdown time 1 month due delay super spreader events hospitalizations rising sharply.

You’re fooling think stopping momentum train big easy. big supply chains fucked. Driving extremely dangerous there’s nowhere go seriously injured. heart attack stroke die. mass graves return. refrigerated trucks overflowing. Crematories won’t able keep up, dead extremely infectious.

I hope snap denial bad soon get good dose fear. hones senses gets priorities order. Everyone underestimates guaranteed worst winter lives reduced chances surviving it. see South Africa. Gov blindsided us twice alcohol ban night comes effect can't storm bottle stores. Today. Worldometers shows 101k US today. Maybe Mr. Beast widespread million dollar challenge uses random video calls website asks location every hour (obviously would agree this) make sure stay home, use delivery services get need. Last person leave wins $1,000,000. Make national challenge hundreds thousands people. would probably get people stay home lol.

Just joking, people really cancel go virtual (or quarantine 14 days) year throw HUGE gatherings next year. Trump’s back first pressers. First impressions hard shake. Ultra COVID Goku Guess worth effort save people's lives. screw people think otherwise. Probably propaganda planning meetings. :( I’m saying we’re going eradicate virus. I’m saying we’re going get point we’re longer technically pandemic, getting point going challenging can’t get people get vaccine. vaccine high effective rate, that’ll great us get safely move lives part. it’s lower numbers, we’re going dealing longer time. 101k now... jesus wooo new record!!  Shitshow getting started. Tolerating intolerance enlightened. Sorry enable crazy Looks like Fauci couple months. I'm also metro Atlanta honestly mask compliance nearly 100% public. agree, I'm thankful we've decent numbers. concerning considering bunch potential super-spreader events ahead good. 

Possible causes increase:

Halloween

Voting

Unrest/protests election

College kids flying home (a lot schools going fully virtual thanksgiving rest semester)

Thanksgiving

Christmas/holidays

Also rapid pace increase last weeks absurd Sliver play button day! That's I'm scared of. Nodding head like another sycophant briefings Walmart pillow guys. going keep growing sadly. states start getting shit together / government people actually enact social distancing + masks Um, know tongue-in-cheek feel compelled point February 30th. Well also, stamped OG SARS pretty quickly. Long-term immunity could tested. 

I've see one study SARS survivors t-cells interacted COVID-19 casings, that's definitive. 

I think know.  It’s sad me, everyone see mention America vivid sentence usually followed “biggest one day/increase record” schools town opening week everyone arguing town Facebook page wearing masks handing candy. sentiment seems people refuse wear mask home put one short interaction answering door. Like coming house thats problem. making lot confusion among parents towns ""safe"" trick treating map actually means. positive cases shut down....... Give year. keeps may well get there. R F E C N going every day thing sometime actually starts something curb spread virus. Don’t worry, Michael Bay taking rest season, expect bunch war explosions rest 2020. 360 turn lol Entitled parents..... I'm sure that's comforting forall dead people people care grandparents hear Trump White House went pretending anything admitting don’t care accepting virus spreading (and helping along holding super spreader events) it’ll infect it’ll infect happen die face life-long challenges it. election November 3rd. Better 2 million American deaths  Halloween gonna insane tomorrow  There's many people like think caught it, folks never get antibody test. free red cross donation centers would saving life potentially. get tested? Lol, thats cute. USA! USA! USA! That's jobs, man! turning much, going circle. can't serious. making comeback people getting lax. making comeback gays getting married. Tune Reverend Kenneth Copeland. answers. it. I'm anti-tagger. Clearly answer less testing Dr. Fauci predicted back June. deaths: 933

What cause lower percentage positive people dieing almost every country ? Virus mutation ? Doctors becoming familiar disease ? seen good report this. *narrator*

""There not."" Masked protesters different story unmasked legion. morally strong leadership, would. morally strong leadership *and* well informed population, would would supported vast majority. Sadly, lack things present. ...care elaborate why?
Also think matters rich. I’m lucky job able switched WFH family working grocery stores hospitals. city patchwork live barely affordable old fixer upper home two streets half million+ homes I’m NextDoor area see shit do. 10% infection rate going come anywhere close creating herd immunity.  Thanksgiving Christmas gatherings might actually cancelled like shit lord ""predicted"" Biden would do, even though running show right now. fire fauci totally mismanaged

all Europe lost cause point... compare U.S Belgium Switzerland, steady rise cases 6+ months... first wave, got control, hope controlling now.

My country (Australia) overcoming second wave two populous states, recording new case totals single figures week now. second wave took death toll 250 900... bad second wave indeed... Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* It’s kinda interesting though. feel like I’m going opposite. Bay Area complete lockdown (only essential businesses open March April May since hot spot especially many international travelers.) We’ve mask mandates since April. Indoor dining reopened (with limited capacity social distancing) Monday October 26. talking resuming person classrooms potentially November 9 earliest long schools provide plan safe. remember got directly exposed back June couldn’t get test short tests reserved people risk people showing symptoms. walk-in rapid tests anyone. We’re reopening rest country shutting mean, wide variety reasons Trump could benefit COVID chaos, think that's sinister - observational. went SARS 1, Toronto.

We American noise machine confusing things, SARS beaten quarantine although escape once. SARS scarier, covid scarier. dangers abstract. Absolutely 😂. Four days til Covid-response referendum.

A long hard winter lockdown ballot. better USA .....Username...Checks out? similar plan well. 100% confident every individual Halloween night would provide candy socially distanced, stay away trick treating groups, properly wear masks, may try. that’s joke. There’s way trust everyone right. We’re going fun home. set poor education. states? California doing? don’t know check information. happier, Brussels resident, serial haircut procrastinator. wondering whether pull trigger getting trim today not. Guess make decision another 6 weeks. That's good idea. also plan in-home trick treating. Luckily 3 year old already invented trick treat game put toy houses/buildings around house (I build lego) goes one stuffed animal give candy. dragon likes throw candy. 

After that, plan taking nice stroller walk fun route know eats much candy wants, gets run around nice field area local train yard loves loves trains. safe family friendly, lots room staying hell away people.

Shit sucks, I'm going let eat many Dum Dums wishes. Kid loves Dum Dums. thought White House took care it?! Meta-study means research look available studies assess quality evidence. data mostly looked households one person infectious rest household swabbed see got infected not. Spouses tend infect more, infect children less. data mixed, Chinese studies found lower rates infection among children, Korean study found older children teens rates comparable adults. lived downtown ATL year, right across olympic park coca cola centre. loved it, miss mellow mushroom. Thanks lot declaring Covid Trump!! already see totally ended.... wait.. optimism encouraging! hate seeing kind thing Melbourne, embarrassing. struggled much second lockdown here. Seeing people react glee arrogance country's going lockdown shows really sad side society. bitter. know seems inevitable wise lot Europe go lockdown point, still wish stress upon anybody. number new deaths seems stable since August. 

Parts Europe reporting similar trends steady increases new cases without corresponding increase deaths. sarcastic, research right now? know need individuals minimize risk, do? Narrator: *its never late hurry up* link nonpaywalled full article anyone can’t access like years, time people already infected antibodies worn they’d get reinfected. 

Never ending

Fuck COVID said “Make America Great Again”, didn’t specify would great at. many ways tough virus. show you’re interested. read entire bible several times cover cover. Read parts every single day. said bible meaning author. I'll gladly discussion biblical theology like.

Yes, believing God believe means created Covid-19. Why? would love provide answer I'd definitely ignorant then.

I also believe God put current government charge time follow leadership unless prevents worship. Going back original comment, mask mandate infringe right worship goes we're taught follow mandate. important part getting ahead virus contact tracing. feel pretty confident you’re tracking testing enough positivity rate 5% less. 
Some examples:
You test 10000 people, 300 positive. 3% positivity, don’t need testing. 
You test 1000 people, 70 positive, 7% positivity, need tracking testing. I’d still rather live west see states trying get us back lockdown like France rn. Don’t think it’ll go well tho Offices schools getting too. home still helpful, though. one person gets want spread whole family easily. Good ole Idaho 35% positive. I've seen links before, perhaps posted it. always appreciate seeing it, dang depressing live here. One major problems rural states still can't get test without full book symptoms. mom sick (definitely tested positive), range mild symptoms several days, get tested without fever. Plus idiots avoid getting tested shut schools school sports. school district even cohorts like larger cities - maybe understandable cases, county 15% positivity rate, supplies. Positive students quarantine 5 days, students exposed positive student encouraged wear mask 7 calendar days. Glad pulled son school home. could've taken account happened 1918. Christmas too! bad around world, Australia really well, state 4 new cases last 24 hours. bragging, point is, Trumps management virus far acceptable. long bills win super bowl, lord 6 MILLION recovered.

Frankly, that's number care about.

Even ""recovered"" people non-zero chance lifelong issues virus.

My eyes many people died. complete bullshit. time something came went long time ago. Can't put back bottle now, things normal 2022.  gloomy? 500,000+ Americans tested positive week ALONE acting like number someone wrote sticky note put Twitter. People like acting like biggie reason still spreading uncontrollably like wildfire.. 

Based fatality rate new infection rate possibility killing 25K Americans. worries though right? data following every major holiday, get together/gathering, super spreader event hasn’t taught anyone anything. Give two weeks we’ll see people wake thinking didn’t think real. long that, loved ones start dying. 

Meanwhile, never affects anyone asymptomatic even consider might part spread. lack testing lack people believing scientific medical professionals, never get control. 

My mother still goes wherever wants usually ends mothers house sisters house afterwards doesn’t think it’s necessary wear mask around none it...

I wonder feels like ignorant denial...maybe would worry bit less unfortunately care. think losing loved ones practically everything else past 8 months. “Biggest one day create record” become new norm. Can’t answer you. It’s okay. Go back bed.  try worrier. Calm down, shit nearly bad making head, fucking you. Obviously. 

Go take walk. Dont forget mask. million people (so far) end world... better overreact right take seriously enough. curiosity, I'm American, winter/flu season there? new spike related it? I'm kinda scared it'll matter time hits country winter.  That's guy Rachel Maddow said tonight, apparently heard people state department. get Eli Roth stop directing least? much violence take. Every politician good voters allow. Pretty much definition. majority voters disagree politician decide replace them, well... they're gone obviously. see good politician, look voters elected them. see bad one, thing. 

You said yourself. He's afraid re-election. voters short-sighted dumbass inbred sister fucking hicks, problem. 

Alas.   nah, idiot/mass murder chief gonna rally, doesnt matter tho. Lets really ramp fear panic days election. Bow media god, even NYT diffuses Chinese propaganda Tegnell skickar vidare mejlet till generaldirektör Johan Carlson, men även till Mika Salminen. Tegnell bifogar en kort kommentar:  poäng skulle tala för att hålla skolorna öppna för att snabbare nå herd immunity”.

This found Google.

But yeah, truly nothing changed. Schools open. fast Doc, know sure humidity issue. Read  God mask difficult wear? it’s fucking snowing October 9th grade science taught weather doesn’t change quickly around water New England build diff ig honestly ""You're invested cult ever doubt me."" says you’re going public, wear mask remember they’re one measure protection won’t keep completely protected themselves. Two words: national emergency postponing election. rate it’s matter time health system collapses. People die street, waiting line ER. prepared see likely experience horrible things next couple months. Unless something changes, horrors witnessed. Karma? ROFL. Karma 230k people dead guess too. 

How insensitive completely lacking self awareness. Well has, generally needs kill large portion population first. Good point. Doesn’t consider depth counting tested could vary They're already starting ration care. we're getting started. fucked. pleeeeeease self isolate... nice There's way anyone could predicted this. freedom play, choose play least freedom. ""Winning!"" - DJT, probably 4 favorite holidays right second wave September though.

Because first wave still happening /s countries yo-yoing bad worse, might acknowledge that. America needs overhaul EVERY system ground up, healthcare, infrastructure, communications, banking finance, industry, environmental regulations, everything; including guiding ideology society based on. definitively test positive? I'm doubting you, always good know sure. wouldn’t hopeful. there’s reason flu season fall/winter. Round anti-maskers like cattle let leave fully understand consequences ignorance. Woooooh! USA! USA!!!! LETS GO!!!!! Yeah, chart daily cases daily deaths. Cases started rising September, deaths leveled off. deaths rising similar rate, cases means virus safer thought (more less).

I call new cases 'fake stat' though... legitimate statistic, misinterpreted without Well, virus God's will. Let's chat Sunday morning service. There’s much, fact don’t mask mandate, even people don’t follow it. don’t understand leadership isn’t even trying point. Sounds like fear me. media telling Russian Roulette dangerous. freedom play! let anyone take you. It’s really circle exit.  Good luck. girlfriend got it. almost residents 2 units NY nursing home. died sick. get it, wish disease real fake, toll. really do. #USA! USA! WE’RE #1! Definitely. Probably faster even, honest. ~0.5-1% everyone gets drugs breathing assistance hospitalised. Without assistance, virus lot lethal. Around 5-10% require intervention survive. Congrats, America, fucking suck! Lots money went missing campaign year. 

How much think went towards paying porn stars? They'll find different reasons they

Everyone knows brain surgeons psychiatric stuff. housing urban development. bet double Xmas. always surprises me. many foods (like milk breakfast cereal) fortified including Vitamin D, common foods like fish eggs also it. Excel hard man... remember South Korea put country highest possible alert death toll 7. people still saying increased testing! side flat earth live on??

Well we've 8 fucking months shut majority country made 101 excuses get car every week summer. banished family included. likely Biden. Republicans expected vote Election Day. far, far registered Dems cast ballots earlier Republicans. no, please tell truth website. People hate hearing truth. got bunch fancy chocolates random Asian candies mystery snacks fun trying! Figure since won’t bunch trick treating candy lying around eat might well treat premium treats watch movies porch lights firmly off! LMAO humble, right, really fair compare super power dirt poor third world country billon population. live IL. see many Pritzker Sucks signs bumper stickers place. Facebook comments local news stories corona nothing bashing ground praising states open. commented something along lines ""You're brain dead can't understand he's trying protect you."" seen many disgusting replies messages received saying that. faith anyone here. get screamed daily basis asking people wear masks work. That's big assumption. signs currently point C19 inducing strong immune response. 

Even antibodies fade. still tcell bcell immunity suppress infections. 

And currently longer term studies show people still going strong antibodies 6-7 months.

Reinfections widespread right now, assume sterilizing immunity fairly durable. Probably somewhere 6-24 month range normal family viruses. Even then, left nothing. tcells bcells. protect mucus membranes infected, make virus easier fight mild. 

So even continues circulate pandemic, likely immune suppressed endemic disease causes coldlike symptoms mostly asymptomatic infections. relate Taiwan, South Korea, New A

Across world, barring shining examples Taiwan, New Zealand (much smaller) China (its different set-up) almost every country, even good government suffered. Maybe much US/India Brazil have. point elected government part problem. People level IQ EQ posses bigger problem. world would people need elected official tell dangerous? Havent years years influenza deaths enough fodder brain? country prides greatest democracy times- hard general population read write? people ( me) people US countries including let COVID win.

India shit. still say people illiterate rural areas even isnt excuse news broadcasts local, regional English. Even illiterate person understands covid bad. 

COVID shows people keep adopting new technologies, want latest iPhone, latest gears accessories comes common sense basic understanding, lot us still Neanderthals evolved mentally. go back taking seriously less 1,000 cases? remember apprehensive previously planned trip Smoky Mountains back one case entire county 77 state. you’re saying wait couple years millions die, can’t even wait! make logical sense. Per capita sensible way measure it.  300 million people yeah course we'll say Mexico PER CAPITA worse mean death numbers two weeks? never beaten, stabilized, original goal somehow became eradication. saying meal real food vs pills, I'm gonna take real food. couldve known guy science degrees experience would actually know he's talking about? Nobody could've foresaw think prefers the_donald hundreds posts amassed subreddit banned. said it, disabled *sucks*. think many people willing admit that, especially disabled like are. 

Wanting others able avoid unnecessarily risking disability others ableist, motherfucking **common sense empathy fellow human.**

I hope things improve lots soon. I'm rooting you. POTUS constantly pushing narrative incredibly well repeatedly praised heads state miraculous performance ""tied 9th worst UK"" sound quite bad. rate herd immunity. Hate say it, things go trump's way gonna nightmare christmas attending Trump rallies, unmasked? Good idea? likely vaccine out. posting numerous times sub it’s always answer. People don’t want distance vaccine. This. ITT: people complain insubordinate cops, rest try explain cops actually take orders people question begin with. Ok, you’re moron. Thanks clearing last bit. realize people save money they’re working get fired want quit, can. telling you’re stupid save money? need momma, I’m fine cutting trees excavating atm, even wasn’t, I’d still enough 12 months.

Also, old people didn’t choose old, confused bring morbid obesity whatever else. 

Wait doing, I’m responding comment like bumpy brained person wrote it, way smooth that. 

I’m gonna abandon ship retardation drags Read article. cares advising local officials 40 states. sociopath convinced narcissistic cult leader murder followers families anybody may come contact with. Sadly, start worst decade.... heavy users r/trees said got disease lost desire vape thc smoke weed partly breathing already become hard enough. 100k get tested. We're probably breaking 200k he’s pretty much every single time. 🙄 Yep. tested positive Wednesday despite symptoms (yet?) around anybody symptoms. Thinking got parents last weekend. They're people we've seen. say feel sick anything. Covid weird.  I'm scared I'll get sick Sunday Monday pretty safe. 8 9 days post exposure (assuming picked last weekend visiting parents). find get tested locally? population density Japan also way higher across board US. comparing, rather, statement India. US also terribly that's beside point. traveled 20k miles gone 40 states speak local officials WH response fucking joke One point 34% remained 6 days 30%. maybe 80 per cent came second outbreak Victoria they've got control strict lockdown. Got 750 cases per day August back zero odd low single digit day last week. done. USA recorded cases one day China entire pandemic proud summer everything looks perfect winter return like happening northern hemisphere. made mistake Europe. Stay safe :) Holidays reward functional society. one them. Taiwan never enough cases need lock down. Korea, Wuhan-style lock down, certainly implement localized restrictions, Mainland China done since April. Korea's outbreak large China's original outbreaks. countries outbreaks large (or larger than) China's - Italy, France, UK, Spain, US - ultimately implemented China-style lock down, even wider geographic area China - finally got control it. last spike around almost exactly three weeks rising cases deaths started rise. 

It's three weeks seven-day moving average gone 715 834, deaths rising likely continue rise. equivalent deliberately crashing full A380 every goddam day months end. needed Olympics year anyways records like this? think Trump fired scientist speaking global warming carbon pollution early administration. COVID-19 appeared, apparently one around tell contain COVID-19 outbreak early else everywhere US like common flu contagious deadly. Next time make comment snarky insult it, learn bit civil. Otherwise come across plain old moron (apologies really one, everyone different suppose). i’m disagreeing whatsoever. 


but also feel like won’t making shit worse quickly? he’s preferable candidate two options, full stop. ideal candidate. 

relax. cases they're calling car accidents COVID! Even President United States said know doctors get money somebody dies COVID, know that, right. mean doctors smart people. say is, I’m know sorry everybody dies COVID. Germany places, heart attack cancer, you’re terminally ill, catch COVID, say died cancer, died heart attack. us, doubt, choose COVID. It’s true, it’s true. No, they’ll say, Oh it’s terrible said, it’s true. It’s like $2,000 more. get money. could happen us."" Yeah, basically bogus it’s actually out. Since July it’s said “insert month here” wut? rooting cases?! Coronavirus vs America Troy State v Devry. found article lengthy eye-opening, ways Dr. Birx hamstrung CDC vital data europe issuing bonds pay people money, crazy political motive US stalling stimulus, issuing one. Fuck country moronic majority. rather isolated communities?   came winter. really believe we, country, would need mass quarantine kind. diverse based state, based county maybe, based lifestyle job. still work everyday ability telework available. Though live area lowest numbers positive cases, diverse nation. travel state state open restrictions. It’s freedom gives us power choose also makes numbers worse. Stop trying make sardines happen. Trump probably try blame Democrats. USA! USA! USA! DC Metro think virtual schooling huge. Fairfax County teachers unions refusing go person believe Montgomery/Frederick MD counties also virtual. 

And republicans wealthy moderate types even taking covid seriously. Y’know, always thought I’d dead hit 25. Turns might right, different circumstances. Win-win guess? Australia? guys handled well 7% bad long takes infect everyone America? Burt Bacharach wrote happy jingle think perfect lift wait hospitals reach capacity. death rate covid-19 spike, death rate everything would require hospitalization spike. Car crashes requiring emergency surgery ICU space? Suddenly fatal there's nowhere put them. Heart attacks stroke? Much fatal there's nowhere put treat them. 

America number one three categories: number persons incarcerated, percentage dumbasses per capita, number totally preventable covid-19 cases (absolute number per capita, obviously related second point). That's like asking would drug prohibition enforced would traffic laws enforced. simple. Either fine asses throw asses jail. I'm sorry democracy help prepare countries pandemic? worst affected countries world run democracies. know read ridiculously incorrect article statista.com claimed US prepared country world pandemic, October 2020, still make assessment US still best country pandemic?  WOOOOOO!!! USA USA USA USA!!!! Thanks sources! really, say ""it's effective 'x' percentage children"" everyone says, ""okay good enough back school Billy safe now! ""

Really see scenario playing out? America? Really? blame Biden old annoying least closely resembles human being. Without disrespect Fauci man work really despicable senile farts named Ronald, hard tell he's done anything us already.

The nation plague capital. enough people listen medical departments they're compromised they're almost useless* help constantly publish contradictory data outright lies which, although may benevolent (""don't buy masks medical workers them"") intention cause harm good.

\* =

- still debating ""mask efficacy"" *July*, CDC? *ever* debate? COVID new strand virus, coronavirus we've known decades masks great way curb them
- still trying debate aerosols main vector spread? We've known decades too.
- still trying debate spread surfaces? We've also known decades, can, well. CDC. Look up. You’re random me. easily fooled though consistently support political party cannot name subreddit without getting banned, party tells virus hoax party, one vanish day election. hear out... could eat 10 lbs Sardines instead. tinned fish hours hours never ending feast instead pill Yep, cases taking us closer ""true"" fatality rate, IFR.

Traditionally, mild/asymptomatic cases dont get tested, factored later use statistical models estimate IFR. difference cases hard counted instead estimated.

I believe C19 deadliest outbreak since 1918, dont problem masks, types headlines fairly disingenuous without context. Pfizer totally new kind vaccine. RNA based. rush that. I'm going home Thanksgiving year reason. gave haircut procrastination, ordered trimmer online family member simple haircut. Saves money avoids risk pronounced thermometer. They're childfree person making stupid point. They're talking people children. 

However, agree wrong place, wrong time, dumb fuck topic. 2021 gunna wild. Welp, first thought bad is, realized 3 times many cases per capita country less testing per capita (since somehow capacity)... every adult american blood hands, honest, others

it's hard make right decisions billions dollars year spent misinforming population Half countries - lol what?

Yeah Liechtenstein Germany basically 1:1. Sure.

And ""monarchies"" countries like denmark, netherlands, etc arent monarchy either. Inform  Cold comfort someone might otherwise lived another 30 years condition makes COVID deadly. No, ball drop going virtual year. People going allowed gather Times Sq like previous years. Vaccines come rescue next year. responsible encourage others same. told multiple customers work mask properly today complied.  Lots people willing listen reason, understand tired, I’m tired masks gloves takeout movies airplanes.  need proper haircut I’m hair it’s less dangerous get haircut go skydiving.  Please keep good behaviors encourage persuadable. 4% world population ~24% deaths. youre retarded hahahaha wish surprised, pretty obvious day one US see couple million casualties thing. full people barely educated, think science tool devil, ignorance good knowledge. That, plus right-wing conspiracy theory lunacy top.

Millions dead always inevitable America. 99.9% survival rate guys

/s

this fucking sad ridiculous sad.Dude safe protected. kind question this? literally hundreds thousands people dying something exist year ago serious? 

The best part even hit peak.

But sure, let's sit around ask retarded questions barely dress morning. meant actual country. Watching Canada, shit-show presidency would funny fucking goddamn terrifying. “Rounding corner” amazing public schools rich white areas. knew times folks said ""Avoid like Plague"" folks scoffing going ""psh, wusses avoid plagues."" Covid several times contagious flu.

If flu R0 1.2 covid's 4, dropped covid reproductive rate 1 summer. actions wound dropped flu 0.3. 20 generations reproductive rate 0.3 wound drop active flu cases 10^6 10^-5. unlike covid reproductive rate back 1.5 increasing 50% seasonality, flu's would still 0.45.   really think worldometer reliable tool anymore. 

There's plenty times official data completely different website showing. shows ~3 thousand new infections Germany, we've actually cracked 20 thousand yesterday. 

It also show important metrics like positivity rate (of tests). Poland completely fucked metric get worse. Lets continue game: Illinois 7k, US equivalent 192k. Wisconsin 5k, US equivalent 284k. Minnesota 3k, US equivalent 170k etc. idiot, that's one theory. others. fact even contemplated others says failings anything else. feels speak mind, too. Political party matter comes fighting pandemic, may noticed sharp divide response based political party. Honestly tell guvmint workers like DeJoy like Fauci? Can't trust guvmint employees days. #metoo !

This clarify actual hospitalization mortality rates, hopefully. hiding plan? could saving lives. loses going reveal plan? Go Slovakia 🇸🇰 USA! USA! fact deaths happen mostly people past reproductive age. That's good way 'depopulate' decide over. We’ve seen enough movies know, villain move. news, people don’t read protests may even LOWERED number cases overall. virus likely spread actual protests (despite outside masks), things like curfews caused protests kept people bars restaurants. Lives Matter protests may slowed overall spread coronavirus Denver cities, new study protests brought thousands people together, likely caused many stay home, research team including University Colorado Denver professor concluded First all, deep breathe. Second, good luck trying get Taiwan South Korea outcome point. control spread get over. many people need die ideology?

Also hilarious hate Catholics, like different century. someone collapses outside testing center would definitely test Covid. News agencies would interested him, ""Someone dropping street Covid"" big story.

And positive, would story ""Man Drops Covid Doors Testing center"" instead ""Man Possibly Drops Covid Doors Testing Center"".

As videos China, dont think Chinese authorities said werent legit. widespread. We're number one! like freedoms much do

You specific at, China, lol. Hey, make tiktok video it! asking slightly different things, that's why. mean get infected, B memory cells produce antibodies virus next time clears infection quicker rate, that's probably confused. something explain another user earlier:

Antibody titres drop time need stick around (once clear infections). mean restart process get reinfected since memory cells 'remember' help production antibodies reinfected organism.

When looking reinfection, always going cases happening. pathogen infects host, bodies fight infection. adaptive immune system still humoral factors blood (such antibodies), micro-organisms quickly neutralised. however infected long period time, then, although quicker make antibodies second time thanks memory cells, still short period time bodies fighting infection (hence see people reinfected milder symptoms second time) couple reasons include: mutation (if look papers, cases show small mutations viruses infected them), age (unfortunately get older, immune systems effective) co-morbidities (diabetes, obesity, autoimmune dieases etc. examples affect immune system).

The problem comes people put effort reading around topic immunology jump saying ""it can't true"" since lack basic understanding immune system works, despite people putting time effort explain them. asking evidence there's hundreds thousands journals, articles books immune system works. really intersted, pick immunology book research yourself.  That's literally said. repeatedly told Trump done nothing mitigate covid. 2.2 million unmitigated number. Coroners country: ""The fuck wrong you?!"" I’m favor traditional vaccine. Ok mask form part global control? Democrats busy trying impeach Trump Virus raging China hitting Europe--Macron France 37% approval rating handling virus, Trump 40% approval rating handling virus--Boris Johnson UK would removed office election held right now, Brits pissed him, Labour 5 points ahead polls---Conte Italy heavily criticized Spring acting soon enough, northern Italians dying droves---Switzerland past Spring nothing noticed second infected country World--The point is, Trump hardly worse many Euro leaders, Western nations waited long act today look astronomical virus infections going Belgium, Chechia, France, Switzerland ""we're testing more, cases""

This statement refutes violating basic premises logic. equivalent saying ""No one saw it, bears shit ""you notice hear cases, deaths""

Unlike relationship cases tests, deaths actually increase cases increase infected COVID necessary condition dying COVID. Unfortunately much easier obfuscate deaths infections people blame anything COVID infection death, looking deaths creates unreliable metric virus' impact. would absolutely hear deaths nation-wide campaign covering many people dying disease. 3 days hopefully begin change course. Yep. Racist makes broad generalisation. guy also makes broad generalisation 

Ignorant retarded sure based what, countries population size. Well I'm sure widespread China live there. I'm guessing one us might know talking guessing. What's wrong people downvote valid question?

Sadly still dark actual mortality.
This week mass-testing Slovakia (Europe), 5 million people tested. 
Hopefully give us good numbers.

(Anyone refuses opt 2 week quarantine, that's fair.) Especially since delays death relatively short time.

We die. guess there's nothing anyone point story could've done. yeah would stop tracks stop exponential explosion. never said would happen overnight, said course month. get rid there's good vaccine hopefully wear quickly Uh, realize US failed even worse EU right? Ah, see there. testing loo methods? Time class action lawsuits Foxnews.  Canada... lot self masturbation summer well compared US. Toronto basically number new cases NYC. democrats chicken Sounds like rounding corner... point, would like remind fate 15,000 civilian seafarers worldwide stuck sea since march, without friends family allowed enter mainland corona. Autocracy failed. Yep United States fucking shit. want get fuck thing spend 12 years become pediatrician judged like contestant rupaul's drag race. get prize? Honestly, blew mind seeing people like Krissy Teagan John Legend posting halloween party NURSE dressed plague doctor. Like fuck? articles buried deeper mines moria question West learn anything. 

Do answer question look towns flooded past. town would flood often finally moved town river front. 10 years later real estate town planner asked themselves, ""Why allowing river front space waste?"" developed river front flooded. move fucking town forget 10 years, little hope anything learned quickly forgotten. Well people getting covid mysteriously. Take propaganda elsewhere. like moron demigod keeps saying “some people say work, don’t” mocks way look followers. mortalityrate go later, cause takes time positive test death. whole view compare total deaths per 100k citicens. 
USA 69; UK 68; Belgium 99; Germany 12. 
So bad USA, could obviously worse. Plenty countries significantly worse. think accurate assessment would people dumb  That's price one pays politics. war. Old people something interest. knew would stupid? I'm interested Canadian. guess question there's possible way enforcing mask mandate now? Obviously switch power Tuesday, help government actually take serious. know Edmonton rest Canada big non mask community. cases going again. crazy numbers enough may go lockdown depending icu beds capacity. one-way flights, international airlines still flights Vietnam countries.

My friends came France study abroad 2 months ago, course know yet return. still shitting ok? know many times I've heard Swedish strategy chosen sustained time, marathon Sprint on.

Looks like Sweden's strategy sustainable all?  commenter said actually. control, starting masks slowly take away freedoms instill global dictatorship. lot people going crazy I'm at. One 75 year old person know always talking going restaurant. That's want. told another 70+ year old person know got irate. said ""where's hitler need him?"" said restaurants closed. Thank post illustrates common attitude Western exceptionalism. Start education system. Blame teachers anti-science paranoia. interest going forever.

Leadership levels needs step going survivalist mentality instead learned safe stay East. least US used major pandemics never really affecting us assumed would case again. best indicator hospitalization rather cases. case numbers heavily influenced number tests really indicative anything. Currently hospitalization still 25 percent July April peaks increasing. I'd expect deaths lag hospitalization 2 3 weeks. Also keep mind due better treatments far less deaths daily July April despite hospitalization levels. deaths get spread think less people overall died. worries. really doesn’t correlate experience. Wuhan explosive growth parts China beginning. Korea well. many parts Asia including Korea see infection rate grow measures relaxed mistakes made. It’s hard see it’s really major factor. It’s interesting study it’s quite preliminary. agree large parts West completely failed tackle pandemic.

The question West learn anything.
I'm sort skeptical. Neither population governments seem even want learn defend instead.

Unwillingness observe, learn adopt successful things countries outside bubble West serious issue lot Chinese go tents willingly. still went. Really can't India win race, you? it! hate hope stay safe well despite others lack care.

Happened earlier year, grandmother passed away alone nursing home due covid restrictions. Wouldn’t even let husband family visit died. 2020 fuckin sucks. That’s Australia well. 

We closed international state borders early, government paid us stay home, wear masks, followed rules. 

Hell, state borders still closed 4 cases today. 

You’re trying make excuses, fact is, right thing. describe this? dont see relation flu vaccine, especially mentionted article.  Keep America Great. differences cultures makes happen. Western culture capitalistic freedom focused
 makes fighting pandemic difficult. want government controlling day day life need pandemic looking profile, already new? heard something like months ago. This....the science definitely catching virus. Antibody treatments extremely effective. many ways fight grandmother!!! Attorney General Ken Paxton El Paso police department direct violation intelligence. live Florida. mask mandate would enforced local law enforcement officers.And it’s conservatives vehement anti-maskers. It’s liberals leftists too. It’s far past point people caring masks actively point people ridicule one on. everywhere go, go walks every morning wear mask walk areas it’s harder avoid people. Maybe it’s I’m Asian, I’ve verbally attacked laughed on. 

I seen people walk around holding mask front face. Covering face hand. straight wearing mask inside stores. includes employees. would literally impossible enforce something like here. Honestly, it’s guess based timeframe slope previous waves. went camp, ate dirt bugs  mentioned coworkers responded “ew, that’s gross. wouldn’t spray alcohol something give kid.” much facepalm. Crank PCR 45 let's see numbers!  shit gonna go away us gotten either survived died. simple White men.

I'm white man suck. care profits. Good thing AWS/Linux engineer work exclusively home now. But...but...HIS EMAILS!1!!!!!! again. UK article testing come cases. death rate 3x lower EU strict lockdowns social distancing.

Let us also forget fact lot non-Covid cases coded covid cases falsely hospitals financial gain. (Verifiable)

Even within Europe death rate 2nd wave declined HUGE factor.

I know downvoted like r/Democrats “pandemic” BS way overblown overhyped now. flu far deadlier Covid ever be. numbers don’t lie. lol thanks laugh/cry much evidence simply case.

If anything, lower dose might increase chances mild case.
Considering often runaway inflammatory response, might solid causal chain. would trust negative day 13 pcr test? Yeah, clearly Trump's fault... Works Dr Nick 1/3 country’s population two cities. millions square kilometres irrelevant discussion basically nobody lives there. slow learner. Best night watching fantastic halloween movie!! too! cares. see wonder many people going exposed COVID-19 navigating crowded testing process. Yeah sure I'll that. Right get bits done. Oh came door absolute priority Let’s put Republicans going lose one cruises. hey, celebrate last justice put there; play activities director Hate Boat ""Perception reality, perceive reality shape will""

Ah yes earth flat moon light bulb. reality. Maybe tripled Yes zero. correct Cops want mask police. Store employees want mask police. unreasonable expect people become mask police. Man, wonder really feel ""spirit"" Halloween year.. like would excited watch horror films read horror stories... wake go sleep stressed every single day night...... constantly suffering high anxiety nowadays barely handle anything even ""fun stuff"" leisure.. Ok it’s hard compare responses say it’s mainly due measures taken isn’t anywhere world compare Asian / Australia / nz too. else west applied measures diligence imo. I’ll stick idea measures work. There’s really counter evidence. general, public ignored information ventilation. Stores around ignoring obvious low-hanging fruit, meaning doors windows closed. CT, one areas US highest societal acceptance reality. Schools still going ""deep cleaning"" mentioning ventilation. like sleepwalking among crowd imbeciles. ""and king, man best story""

 mentally ill pedophile, also Russian asset WWE Hall Famer.......and let's honest, he's damn near retarded would shock even little turned can't actually read. federal democracy. Trump / Washington D.C. power masks except facing camera saying whatever crosses mind. fact February-March, China almost locked entire country, 1.2 billion

At time, China's lockdown much stricter current ""lockdown"" many European American countries. 1 month even close enough time huge case numbers Murdoch press moved Annastacia Palaszczuk.

For efforts, I'm sure much managed sway opinion Victoria. think Victorian government (Daniel Andrews) opened things faster Murdoch screaming. think decisions statistics. 

I'm even sure influenced public opinion much. Sure hate Dan, maybe lot hate people would hate Labor government anyway. Plus trolls course. 85% Australians European descent carry gene variant. evaporated ancestors moved there. higher expectations quality drugs probably long time connections rely on. I'd imagine. lot dumb work, finally it!

🤮 Right. Nothing left. happens concerted effort combat virus. frustrating. sad. Oh good, likely kids town live coming home... got source claim? infuriating someone *without* chronic illness. told stand still unable move, really fucking disappointing many adults understand obvious difference.  We’re talking 21st century. still beheading like middle ages absolutely insane. course reddit somehow rationalize ‘US bad!!’  need stop making excuses people. people gave damn COULD different, that’s point. course Mitch piece shit wouldn’t it, doesn’t mean shouldn’t expect better people. people Canada want border open....... I’ve store since February. delivery curb side pickup now. Fortunately work home, wife stay home mom, afford outrageous markup. feel horrible people don’t advantages. Im surprised trying say snuck across border horse shit. honestly gives fuck anymore? Covid everywhere going stay vaccine I've spending waking hours indeed job searching I'd say 1/3 listings area nurses. state real bad nursing shortage. There's openings CNAs require training pay yourself. think healthcare workers underpaid right hell going through. Hilarious think there’s even slight chance happening. didn’t Bush stuff said, won’t now. also can’t try throw someone prison 100M/330M Americans absolutely love would willing commit violence for, country would collapse. Hi there, already posted nauseous number people die smoking? daily smoking deaths still higher COVID deaths. don’t count report media every day. mean, I'm US think virus conspiracy cull population ""less productive members.""

But clear intent federal government promoting herd immunity? mean... thats would call secret. want us get virus ""get with."" revealed strategy. withholding aid force us back work. Seems obvious care. college moved back home like developed weird need “be adult”whatever means. boiled around time pandemic really hit here. thought family nuts taking seriously.

Hey! sound familiar? is, really bad job. kill rate like .03%. I’m inclined believe contagious, experts really fear mutates quickly much much dead form locked downs needed. There’s general theme turn etiquette specific topics well specific threads lend informative/constructive dialogue. Ideally would love someone able ask opposing view sources produced that, however, that’s Reddit. There’s typically correct way respond subject response accordance theme, generally anticipate downvotes. saying agree it, would love see constructive peaceful discussions certain topics, get that. Italy first lockdown, should’ve seen writing wall. guess part naivety, part thinking “it couldn’t happen like here”. 

I’m Oregon initially seemed like everyone took quite seriously we’d work home month, we’d back normal. won’t happen couple years, ever. 

We’re definitely long haul now. I’ll keep basics wearing mask going large gatherings, harder goes difficult is. chance containment early year, blew it. ""Natural herd immunity"" = ""Let millions people die, mostly frontline workers elderly."" 

It's fucking insane. Even 2% average fatality rate (among Americans. like 13% elderly people.) means letting 6 **MILLION** people die reason! I'm sure run numbers would significantly higher since reaches retirement communities it'll spread like wildfire ""herd immunity"" world. callous ridiculous. even admit problem often hard. sure government still it.  Weird thing say reddit lol Democracy incompatible institutionalized stupidity, political conservatism religion. like Eric andre meme shoots guy asks would ain't first last. I'm joking Remindme! 4 months I've noticed Reddit seem pick narrative strongly. suspect PR firms paid guys try prevent conversations social media going far road. lived WY several years (Sheridan) friends keep contact with. Politicians play stupid games PUBLIC HEALTH instead following medical advice put trial. unconscionable. understanding something like largely random. places infections, less, worse starting point, better.

The end point given enough time same, everyone infected largely due exponential curve ie. disaster. jurisdiction gets unless R0 less one, take sorts random paths.

Anything R0 averaging 1 less, means everyone infected basically once. hammer spikes down, let spread, end situation everywhere enters exponential curve almost once. &lt;--- here, county soon Sweden ~~lockdown~~ recommendationdown sudden?

I know many times I've heard Swedish strategy chosen sustained time, marathon sprint on.

Looks like Sweden's strategy sustainable all?  Nope. vote government. Although origin overthrown goverment non-comunist china retreating taiwan certainly democratic. That's bit different. basically conclusion initial bout. thing still symptoms life recover something else. goes many US states too, example: Illinois 7k, US equivalent 192k. Wisconsin 5k, US equivalent 284k. Minnesota 3k, US equivalent 170k etc. really low-quality journalism. Victoria verge getting control, measures taking far away higher Europe cases continued climb. took near Wuhan style lockdown (some housing complexes early people allowed leave, food delivered state even) able get cases now, zero.

Absolutely mention factors, also done things Western countries not. instance, state Western Australia borders closed since April. one in, out, without good reason - often via 14 day hotel quarantine.

OTOH, music festivals back community cases since April, I'm pretty damn happy situation. We’re number 1! We’re number 1! Take world! think way contagious say.

[It may Also reason Europe pushing past worst case scenarios. isn’t people, it’s leadership. Biden didn’t organize protests. trump doesn’t organize rallies, would lot less spread. It’s hard understand. said friend phone refuses take vaccine available...

""As long vaccine really effective, I'm sorry (friend's name), fuck rest people refuse it. got big boy pants on, consequences really care catch it.""

The people went rallies big boy pants on. vast majority masks. rally town packed shoulder shoulder, screaming cheering maskless. Looking photos, saw couple people wearing mask.

I expect virus spike shortly. 

But place solidly red. waiting Nov 3rd vote, timing works they'll sick then. hope stay home (I'm poll worker.), doubt will. they'll ones refuse wear mask vote.

Now think about, think I'm going level PPE depending kind ventilation place has. Exactly--I think UK deaths 70% compared last Spring Sorry hear friend. Hugs.  done complete 360 worse started. forget ar beginning one knew anything. Everything done fly. Medical procedures still researched one knew treatments worked. Furthermore testing inadequate.

Yet look death numbers many provinces. Zhejiang 1200 cases 1 death? Sure. Jiangxi almost 1000 cases 1 death?

And dont forget PRC numbers include symptomatic carriers. Considering PRC asymptomatic carriers outnumber asymptomatic carriers, numbers would skewed even compared every nation world.

Their numbers add up. Even compared nations right. Adjusted population, France would 250,000... FYI... western civilization thing occur. Please, let's remember President said near-perfect job COVID also change anything he's done handle date. either shows pride attachment appearances prevents course correcting (unacceptable leader) profoundly unable connect severity issue (unacceptable leader) says things clear conscious.  Fucking vote. trust numbers second. Wyoming tons people wearing masks even planning going Trick Treating tonight like nothing's wrong. Going get **a lot** worse. wonder anything Trumps daily super spreader events. AKA rallies. 

Ffs he's trying make catching ""cool"", appalling. wrong country, 40%+ people still support lunatic.  Keep soft foods, might symptoms stomach got shreked Lol, idea. talked probably 15 years so. Last time heard guitar tech Dinosaur Jr playing couple bands. ever run I'll ask pooping habits days. preprint? peer reviewed yet? can’t find journals.  Bruh enforce mask mandate vietnam, singapore, australia, south korea, thailand, finland, norway, latvia, estonia, list goes afraid missing work there’s net protect family.

And yet people like go vote safety nets complaining ""welfare state"".

Maybe guy, kind cognitive dissonance super rampant among blue collar workers. course States many cases reported, done little try contain it. China hand went huge massive lockdown cases basically zero, closed borders everyone entering going proper quarantine. tested huge amounts population anyone positive going isolation.

It's incredible could try compare 2 countries. Well known murder loose, many places would send alerts.


And less people ages get murdered full year U.S.


Covid-19 killed people 0 55 less 8 months. NUMBER ONE men dresses persuade people sky fairy watching touch they’ll burn eternity, already large group believe anything. got poison ivy make sense all, misunderstanding fundamental level. testing increases many cases *we know about*, number cases actually exist change due us knowing them. true would better idea many cases March April widespread testing, knowledge number cases increase actual number cases. Almost certainly, expanding testing *reduces* number cases *some* people receive positive results change behavior avoid spreading disease.

Ask yourself: bear shit woods? know see it? seeing bear shit woods increase amount bears shitting woods? article CNS invasion. 50 odd year old man first case. Chinese doctors raised alarm told virus capable crossing blood brain barrier. know lot people paying attention remember. lot people right arguments family. makes much harder say might grandma's last Thanksgiving Christmas whether gets COVID not. many people situation. even bother reading paper post? Typical lazy person. bother read anything, background knowledge, trolls forums. wow one time, band camp... Kale. say participating risky behavior, said encouraging. safety measures work.  people dont wear mask properly spreading virus. 

The safety measure thats back fited 6 feet social distancing.  People think take mask 6 feet away someone safe... works outdoors. Indoors virus stays air hours.  take mask alone restrooms desk work etc etv could breathing virus.  airborne yet people take mask...

The moment enter building dont take n95 mask.  once. dont eat drink anything im outside home... Ah yes! [This land Mitten's priority confirming corrupt theocracy- inducing judge. give sh*t constituents covid deaths. Utahns? Start learning mandarin :) Unfortunately work people need go work. university professor job done online, online teaching drawbacks definitely possible perfect, on-site teaching masks distancing far perfect well. government lockdown, many others choice.

I apply extent can, though. Yeah, celebrities private. They're people. love kind attention not. David Bowie, Chad Bosewick, Prince come mind. died without general public even realizing sick. 

Going hypothetical thought experiment, maybe would get better next six months. one knows yet long long-term cases are. Maybe cough go away. get crossed casting lists soon? athletes hoping get signed team team. I'm trying say rampant, I'm saying possible. know everyone's private life like. 'fuck libs', probably. Well kinda. least bad situation Poland Belgium is. still think government done good work containing virus. really write write think exposing earth shattering truth? ever crossed mind might know you’re talking about? West Europe, Eastern Western decline since 1945. countries experienced brief years prosperity like West Germany Sweden, years gone 30-40 years. two generations experienced significant material improvement welfare nest prevents masses slip poverty. fuck white supremacy?

Jesus fuck people. stupid reaction west economical reasons people believe opinion valid opinion

And yes economy first attitude made worse economy long run area popular Halloween. Every year probably hundreds kids neighborhoods. it’s never couple kids knocking door, it’s like crowds kids course ton parents ones little. may outside there’s lot interaction happening. claiming mass protests pandemic cause bigger outbreak? antiscience intellectual Murica! could well one worst moments American history us ever see. depraved someone leader pandemic spreader... is. administration. Wow, poor taste. South Dakota insane 42 percent 

Positivity 

That’s without ramp testing wins, still bad, clear anything practical done stop time. Judging Europe's current plight, half baked lockdowns occasional masks going stop spread. going winter death hardship like seen since WW2 Northern Hemisphere. Technically, always true. point got post that's little ridiculous. I'm pretty darn sure sort plan get anybody calls themself democratic socialist today's modern United States, public schools would well funded great (not mention less segregated overall still are) everybody white people. 

we use example used awesome, albeit white people, model could awesome everybody. Still lower Europe PHD 5 months ago, mass testing done Wuhan, China.
The cities China mass testing done repeat (a false negative would caused secondary infection would led repeat outbreak) Everyone wears one wearing one Mission accomplished definitely board long while. love fast reopened everything really going grumble much it, going continue limiting fine.

Then attacked counties opening schools essentially bribing them, really annoyed me. lot friends school aged kids basically became nightmare scenario them. continued push downplaying metrics lately really seems crappy. advocate lockdown least pretend things basically doubled numbers less month ago. Funny mention it. China’s openly admit include asymptomatic included count. Biggest single day record.....so far Coronacorner. perhaps virus deadly winter coinfections? find years data becomes clear. Ah...I see don’t know talking about. Typical sub. pointing one line shows zero critical thinking skills lack basic understanding science.

Uh no. immediate concern, reading title, many died result. thought others might interested severity cases. I'm sorry family taking precautions. Mine would way still lived them. believe real get tirade putting wanting crowd grandmas holidays. I've never glad grown house. feel bad kids young adults right now. 

The people work though...we KITCHEN cooking food public! even try disinfect boss tells us put noses mask he's worried us passing out. stopped ordering bleach June he's sick us getting bleach spots uniform. bleach kitchen pandemic, cool. Wear mask work, works better others wear you, also protect wearer. hamster study showed sick hamsters mask-shielded, rate infection 16%, healthy hamsters mask-shielded, got infected 25% time. good sick people wear mask protect sure hell better masks. Heavily depends country Europe. Cases rising countries clearly handling much better others. example, I'd say Greece Denmark really well, Belgium Czech Republic terribly. course said US states Something something exponential growth amazon accept corona virus return?2 Never never. Mhmm. long stable 300k day past couple weeks Europe, America, Asia, exploding. It’s good time Yeah, tbh really seem matter get long term effects caused example massive decline mental health directly caused covid seems. don’t see wrote where. you? illness kill desire weed?

I think lockdown waay late.

But least would group immunity Hope dark sarcasm, isn’t heard immunity works loon. I’m sure, don’t think said anything bad. words. 

Verified.  Crazy, that's equivalent 16,000 Florida cases  choose location top pulldown One problem though: younger people's immune system seem much effective, maybe working well. feels like ""Mission Accomplished"" moment Iraq. thing I’m wondering Canada enough force us address crisis long-term care? 80% covid deaths far long-term care settings far one talking real sort way. way treat seniors appalling. Boomers need start demanding substantial change next years start ending death traps subjected parents to.  people ***saying*** months.

In many, many, many places people ***doing*** months. Lots places packed bars maskless people weekend, packed indoor restaurants, people wearing masks. live Illinois. People think governor profiting covid-19 tests closing businesses preventing schools sports wants control everything give money corporations. 🙄 idea people tend congregate indoors, there's higher chance transmission.  rate, he'll wrong predicting. world's top researchers infectious diseases American trained.

For now. China's universities shooting global rankings they're putting lot money innovation super-clusters.  I’m saying doesn’t, I’m saying claim protests didn’t ludicrous clearly agenda behind it. clearly explains distinction ""The plague"" usages. cannot dumb further. firmly established lack sense civic responsibility, English science. Hint. word ""plague"" invented due bubonic plague...

Any topic would like express ignorance of? I'm curious, know caused spike? information getting spotty amounts one wears mask. that? earliest vaccine candidates eliminate hospital capacity concern. Trump clueless, he's hardly worse many Euro leaders Lots summer camps right kids quarantine home pods could actually go camp. possible, cheap Republican scientific way.

Present-day China different USSR. Soviet Union never integrated global economy global supply chains China since economic bloc COMECON.  


China's economy also much dynamic USSR's they've making breath-taking investments universities, bullet-trains, infrastructure, paperless pay, solar batteries. support government really ignorant dismiss China.  look public health england figures see one key initial outbreak points Kensington Chelsea. really much analysis extent global travelling class responsible spread bad been.

I’m stupid asking around symptoms. 

Anyone similar symptoms? expect now?

* *may* fined 1600€ *can* go shops, take pet out, basic ""survival"" things. Basically can't go reason take walk, also can't go work. 
* false. decision employer, government, there's law this. employers make rules without negative tests, consequences employees - decide get tested, get paid leave medical care may even get fired. illegal. state tells stay home get tested, that, state tells you. government tells outweighs, obviously, employer tells do. cannot make go work state forbids so. huge middle finger state towards common citizens.
* Prime minister getting death threats... heard interesting. Well, admit, fucked big time. 
* Yes, prime minister builds PR ""oh look many people trying get tested"" - yes course put wall basically leaving choice
* agree ego trip. information nobody know would consult listen scientists people advise him.
* probably hard lockdown this, *is* effective all
* tests accurate way: may positive even test negative, test actual positivity, **they test whether ""infectious"", words, whether infect people**. way accurate. get 'no' twice row (there 2nd round next week) chance actually covid extremely low. Again, testing actual presence virus body, test contagious basically, ""detect"" anything, also infect anyone likely even may covid. makes sense ""negative"" result exception quarantine. believe may prevent nation-wide lockdown basically lockdown.

There good well intentioned hard working poeple world. laurel 1st 3rd 4th graders going go home teaching next two weeks.  virus spread (even though Yellowstone County fucking atrocious right now) teachers staff students. highest number cases far... bad think point shut bars restaurants, folks asia way socialize (you can't host party tiny apartment) whereas prevent big house parties america. thought India going surpass us total number cases there, US like, ""nope, gotta number one"" broke sprint. bother arguing people, brother. think there's already spike cases, nothing matters might well flood streets. understand virus transmission, understand exponential growth, understand wear masks properly, understand need social distancing even face covering. understand put politics aside try get control. fucked part: actually excited exploit pandemic intensify circle-jerk hatred government.

Wearing masks wrong, social distancing, well cares worst case scenario get sick, PiS-voting boomers die amirite? level logic people arguing with. Covid deniers already blood hands far I'm concerned. no, I'm saying social conservative nationalist, I'm saying someone genuine concern empathy citizens older, sick, immuno-compromised, well health workers forced deal mess. everything fucking game political team sport. Many people never deal death sickness loved one, whole concept life death bit abstract apparently. I'm disgusted. Reddit iis like one places people complaining wealthy. Good point could worded better  they’re going 80% Covid cases Rallies caused dad, present healthcare worker, contract virus. 

How know dad got rally? kill good people stupidity. Conspiracy theories flourish human mind programmed see patterns everything. order. Chaos random chance make us uneasy scared.

So fact invisible tiny thing everywhere affecting ways life much handle many. Conspiracies comfort: ""the virus overblown exist"", ""it's election"", etc. importantly conspiracies like give people tangible enemy focus fear anger on: China, United Nations, Secret New World Order, Big Pharma, opposing political parties, per President last days - Doctors. almost like they're related somehow.

The real pain badly we've handled going seen Q1 2021 everything China related everything else very, down. disagreeing immunity towns immunity surges towns. So, either number infections really low theyre catching twice spreading  Yes, Reddit = expert virologists Frankly, people blaming narrowed one American - Trump. start hurling blame WHO, would issue today. need someone blamed failure. Americans great people certainly brainless. definition ""fast hard"" lockdown? lockdown state? lockdowns (Minnesota), masses went shopping like crazy, toilet paper non-existent. Limits grocery products, 5-9 day wait Insta-cart deliveries. GIANT country lot moving parts, people, services, etc. need food. need electricity (if want post reddit lockdown), dependency others supply, build, maintain daily needs. people little resources dependent help others. prepared January/February. freezer full, toilet paper stocked. planned prepared family, took care own. could easily ridden 3-solid months needed be. people prepared ""fast hard"" lockdown would added exponential suffering dependant entirely dependant others. easy fall ego-centric attitude ""I would fine"", unfortunately, many others would still aren't. must American. This. People already care half much next summer people accept care all. nice big Thanksgiving Christmas gathering year pay off. Less presents guests invite following years, it'll save money!

I mean, seeing expensive funerals point doubt would save much money. point gop turning heads citizens need, like yay saved old farts killed peoples lives businesses would never hurt covid drop already? get it, Sweden bad initially. Move on. 99.9999 survival rate, take vaccine sheep like probability 30 million cases plus course gauge death rate. yeah unfortunately internet seem well nuance - think that's end things black white, like ""protests = good, criticize"" ""Trump rallies = bad, leads death.""

And I'm saying someone attended number BLM rallies marches summer. likely spread COVID protests summer? I'm sure some. protests attended every single observed crowd wearing mask marched people packed in, left space normally might. I'm sure helped lower rate spread, like got zero. also probably helped happening warm weather summer.

Now Trump rallies going likely maskless people caring close get one another, colder weather, moving. surprising would spread event like this. 

But people act like zero chance covid spreading protests trump rallies death traps foolish. One obviously causes spread, probably caused spread. black white issue, think many want engage little nuances all. terrifies me, think people completely understand, even US gets leadership try stop decline, take 4 months HARD lock downs get completely eradicated. Even vaccine gets made that's safe everyone takes it, many months production capacity distribution reaches everyone. Worst case scenario, vaccine selects viruses fast mutations conserved regions (spike, example). would mean vaccine would never effective virus mutates quickly. least know case, but... article (unlike one) d614g mutation, new ones (a220v/a222v) dominant across Idk see big deal going out. I’ve found getting drunk watching office almost fun actually believe feel bad brain still deal effects virus though. friend (25) got says still feels winded climbing stairs months ago. death rate might high, covid still dire effect people's health. people southern Indiana want take it. Actual studies also done. yeah unfortunately internet seem well nuance - think that's end things black white, like ""protests = good, criticize"" ""Trump rallies = bad, leads death.""

Every day wake try positive, see horrific things people saying other, awful news headlines people attacked wearing mask, security guards stabbed enforcing mask usage, etc. 

I'm heartbroken what's happened world, ESPECIALLY US, can't get hole hopelessness feel. idiocy people still support him. worth risk right 🤷🏼‍♀️ Proud Boys, white supremacy... overall anti-intellectualism? Take pick. population governments seem even want learn defend instead.

THIS. government, people, affecting pandemic negatively. people want wear masks even quarantine KNOW it. government want stricter fear losing voters many people pansies shout ""you're taking away freedoms"". like governments give **few** shitty idiots move here, can't say Merry Christmas celebrate Halloween schools (in Canada least) stay inside much worry about. Hard get sick stay home allow visitors. question poignant ""if humans descended apes, still apes?""

It betrays level ignorance topic literally nothing contribute discourse covid19 read considered. measures taking far away higher Europe cases continued climb. took near Wuhan style lockdown (some housing complexes early people allowed leave, food delivered state even) able get cases now, zero.

That's overstating bit. housing complex lockdowns happened early second wave ended relatively quickly became clear situation gotten beyond state government's control. bulk lockdown similar implemented Italy Spain first wave, except 1hr exercise allowed, restaurants could remain open takeaway service, addition curfew 5km rule. stupid question. LMAOOOOOOOO riots didn’t right? better word ‘shutdown’ I've strange uncanny ability predict year would play far. wive decided take advantage sorcery lasted started getting affairs order prepare worst possible scenario. Yay, lets break new records next week! /s
While do, I’ll stay quarantined.

Allegany County, residents expect announcements Monday, Wednesday, Friday. state-level, dashboards updated daily. institutions higher education, caseload announcements given anywhere weekly daily.   notable exception precedent Frostburg State University.   COVID-19 caseload information become newly essential critical aspect public life geographic scale. dashboard provided Johns Hopkins University &amp; Medicine Center Systems Science Engineering become authority worldwide country-specific caseload information including total positive cases, total deaths, case fatality ratios. States dashboards, including Maryland, reports data county-level. Many counties dashboards well, though Allegany County Frostburg State University located noticeably lacking. Nearby neighboring counties, like Garrett Washington, disappoint, however.   importance reporting cannot understated; indeed, figures reopening plans based state level federal government deploys ventilators personal protective equipment, name uses. Thus, logic flows reporting institutions expected appreciated layer transparency helps individuals make decisions health health care about.   survey 15 regional institutions including nearby community colleges Allegany College Maryland Garrett College, well numerous University System Maryland campuses, FSU campus report COVID-19 caseload information weekly often. see 15 campuses sampled links reporting dashboards, go here.   intentional, says Liz Medcalf, Director Communications Frostburg. email wrote, “our initial decision report tests two-week period based concern potentially identifying individuals asymptomatic testing tested student-athletes, endeavored consistent.”   FSU far consistent. evaluating timeline caseload announcements sent via email campus community via FSU News, reports released 7 day, 12 day, 14 day intervals.    1: Reporting timeline periods Frostburg State University COVID-19 caseload announcements  campuses promise reports “Monday Noon,” case Shenandoah University “Daily 2:00 p.m.,” case West Virginia University, Frostburg’s website reports “data updated regularly,” give indication expect update. FSU reports typically come Tuesdays, come variable times ranging 11:00 a.m. 2:38 p.m.   asserts Frostburg’s unusual reporting, averages 10.8 days announcements, due privacy concerns student-athletes. context, it’s important note surveillance testing FSU conducted bi-weekly consists 200 randomly administered tests among entire campus population including staff, faculty, students. also includes symptomatic testing conducted Brady Health. addition testing, NCAA mandated 25-50% athletics department tested every week. Athletic testing revealed significant COVID-19 positive results, resulting baseball men’s lacrosse teams quarantined earlier semester. email Monday, Oct. 19, FSU reported numerous athletic teams, including men’s women’s basketball, men’s cross country, certain track field cohorts would pause athletic-related activity, announcement stopped short revealing positive cases among rosters.    snapshot Salisbury University COVID-19 Dashboard Oct. 20 2:00 p.m.  concern student-athlete privacy appear part decision-making institutions. Indeed, NCAA mandated testing factor colleges universities athletes practicing campus. According Salisbury Daily Times, student-athletes Salisbury University training working weeks, yet campus provides COVID-19 dashboard updates frequently daily. worth mentioning Salisbury reports positive cases even number single digits, example Oct. 14 one campus community member tested positive.   certainly many campuses, including FSU, report positive negative cases, overall positivity rate, number tests administered, leaders universities take data analytics much seriously. look Salisbury dashboard reveals daily weekly caseload, rolling analytics aggregated week, month, cumulative totals. campuses, including West Virginia University, also break positive cases respective population, segregating students faculty staff. also those, like University Pittsburgh, report number active students isolation, like University Maryland, Baltimore report percentage quarantine housing occupied. information ever provided Frostburg State University.   though FSU leaves plenty desired way COVID-19 transparency, New York Times suggests real issue hand lack national tracking system, disparities campus size, variable reopening plans “make campus-to-campus comparisons” somewhat inappropriate. Indeed, campuses subtract cases people recover report tests performed campus.   lack consistent, timely, transparent reporting Frostburg continued thorn sides campus community members. faculty member College Liberal Arts Sciences asked remain anonymous amid looming threat layoffs pay reductions wrote email, “why always feel like we’re pulling teeth get information around here?” “bIg PhArMa BaD” Gold star special needs nation world....good job Gump nation. (Trump nation)

The used car salesmen talking heads sycophantic worshippers literally retarded.....on sides. failed businessmen running one biggest corporations world. government positions typically scrape bottom barrel?
Is good shit settles?  bottom? Scam artist mean good businessman. Liars smart like love boast. They're liars.

Ya know old adage cannot do... teach? know true right? applies business. cannot succeed gravitate government.

I'm religious damn rings true.......""by fruits ye shall know them"". 90s early 2000s raised idea internet going make world better, intelligent better informed, open place.

It incredibly disappointing see failure promise. after:

Marketing Florida vacation season. Come one come covid free sunshine state.

People nasty surprise. never gotten flu shot (am date shots though). good reason it; never bothered. 

I got first flu shot earlier week. This. I'm surprised took many years 1911 produce another global pandemic. nominate guy sacrificed gonna lie, might want transfer. left ICU go PACU. 8 months broken, end sight. Still high risk, Covid unit saved sanity. guess it’s surprising around 10k people critical condition given moment. thought would Credible sources believe likely that, absence swift (and, view, unlikely intervention), daily US COVID deaths could soon Judging number deleted comments below, suspect right! haven’t eradicated flu now? circumstances donald trump allowed stay office, wins election needs impeached immediately, he's killing people fox news spreading fucking lies Yeah, rest worlds ""lockdowns"" equivalent wearing mask chin. Wow. hoping got past worries would over. believe breaking 100,000 cases per day March... ability diagnose cases (lack testing available). Yup. Protests aren’t predictor cases. person credit card sales are. True...but regardless child could spread it...I really wish plain common sense/forethought could class taught school common sense warrants EVERYONE diligent careful decisions. problem home going necessities visiting 7 children occasionally, briefly usually virtually. However, believe people want go shopping dine safely (following protocols...this key) indoors means go ahead. think it’s ok send child AWAY literal cesspool random germs carried 100 different children beyond common sense right now. way handful people supervise diligently enough 100+ kids. You’re going ignore differences rallies one side everything possible keep spreading virus didn’t, along fact protests weren’t found major spreaders virus since people wearing masks staying one place long? want continue say it’s sides since don’t want admit right fucked everything since beginning. necessarily bad thing, terrible metric use basing public health decisions it. wait virus spreading like wild fire, hospitals nearing capacity, ICU's overflow mandate masks, late. 

You mandate masks, close bars, person dining, etc. ""Dire"" situation... hell anyone understand now? reddit wants shit low number state agree views. virus go away, turn another seasonal flu. Also People always party, cannot punish hosting parties. me! Might guy tho, definitely said 1million people US gonna die over. freedom expression association intrinsically linked innovation, China wants succeed West, ""steal"" too, spark Enlightenment defines West endure.

These words ignorant arrogance. Innovation longer domain west. Look carefully happening China. Go visit it. trajectory real worrying. boss. nearly careful people be. It’s literally job enforce law. happens go work say I’m part job. get fired.   Depends interpret ""back to"".

How long take see hand sanitising station buffet station again? I'd surprised come 2025 we're already lax again, maybe. see. That’s gonna long 4 years. Indoors versus outdoors, unmasked versus masked, taking precautions general life protesters were. 

It’s obvious protests didn’t drive spread think second.

People eating inside much problem. 1/10th number die daily covid. impose traffic laws mandatory seat belts. distinction isn’t really relevant West “lockdowns” lockdowns figurative sense, country know done literal lockdown China outside. people know exposed gone seen doctor would guess 100% infection rate would show 40% confirmed cases that. good news guess? read due paywall, found articles epidemiologist. interesting theory, one would understand magnitude timescale effect balance covid risk correctly. disagree sort limited lockdown elderly infirm best balance risks, (at least live) hospital capacity limits risk increase case fatality rate. 

Though disagree, appreciate providing source. bet believe numbers bad. Kinda? thought since Minneapolis. It’s fucking obvious.  Bryson Italy testing waaaaay less US. New York much testing Italy. virus know supposed go away election? Shit, guess back lining Target 7am... Kapitalism* failed No. I’m saying people would wear mask regardless. Fuck Murdock, fuck Scovid. need go (sent melbs) Yeah went one. gf worked shitty school poor neighborhood street 4th grade students read level first grader school always, American public surpasses Fauci’s expectations miles aunt, one favorite shitty sounds, recently placed oxygen tank 24/7 recently.There’s nothing want right go see Can't vote Tories everyone alive 4 years -taps forehead- agree sentiment, little unempathetic tell people get married zoom. bar mitzvah wedding. people stupid careless!? 0.4% = 400 40. Yeah like US sudden started dysfunctional govt. brewing many years, head govt completely incompetent Dude you’ll fine going skid 22. twenties last awhile. Guys. it. We’re number one. You’re right. Hey man. People love you, things scary, best make through. 

I don’t get lot sleep either, best get shut eye. Worrying inevitable. Sleep good. time people learn actions inactions consequences. cant undo damage already done still work minimise damage Truly third-world country sound ridiculous, please stop “Russia” crap. US fine awful Another unwanted record set.

And didn’t bunch politicians declaring virus “over”? beyond comical point, going pull fucking finger out? youre genuinely cringe. youre used arguing youve lost ability civil. kids outdoors serious threat corona spread not. go somewhere nonsense assumptions aggression. blocked Unfortunately, already US. Japanese practice mask wearing even outside pandemics, would relatively well prepared do. Props them.  47 states experiencing new wave. Almost every country Europe experiencing - Lombardy, Paris Belgium, previously lightly touched regions Poland, Czech etc. 

It's following July sun belt pattern April concentration regions high international travel density. following pattern many experts expected respiratory viral spread season. Mass protests mass covid really. predictions people everything correctly, course didn't. You’re right. Holy shit! new wave covid even worse b4 lots sick containment measures, flu hit hard.? feel like even anti vax ppl need get one least year article mention... people wearing masks events no? Yeah Fauci smartest dipshits I've ever seen life. incitement. That's protected first amendment America either. wash hands lady's room know Yes, flu cases 95% people wearing masks socially distancing. 

How stupid? Explain. suppress info concentration camps, yet everyone Reddit knows talks constantly 🧐 interesting approach. wondering follow going try eradicate virus like China, attempt ‘circuit break’ suppress. Either way hope turns well. Sorry sounds stupid, said working peak pandemic April. daily case counts daily deaths right peak 7 months ago? Ahh, google friend. Check out! 

Exponential growth *by epidemiologists regards covid* every 3-4 days. Exponential growth general absolutely mathematical equation, rate doubling predetermined equation. don’t think defense mechanism (for people). aren’t smart people unable critically think distinguish fact propaganda. White House said defeating covid-19 listed accomplishment! /s france though, 560 deaths per million, even picking big UE countries france lower spain, italy uk. US overall higher death per million UE need make statistics This, true, would quite interesting development. youre worried, quarantine set proper precautions life. youre worried, carry on. America, either. humans living within borders freedom continue free choice whether like not. sensored. Reddit allows left leaning ideas conversations. moment used facts common sense, slow choke response rate hoping did, stopped commenting. comment, I'll either choked like you, banned, comment deleted. gathers number votes. Missouri, skipped right Lewis Clark mention French Spanish formerly lived area, let alone Native Americans.   Online schooling? k McDonald’s beer? US man we’re contact different doctors hopefully get one later November suck. scheduled Wednesday showed said “well they’re sorry” trying say *It almost definitely is..only measures taken makes difference*?

Why blind findings?

*This gene variant thought be..*

*Just possibly..*

No. Read study pay attention. use tl;dr picture description lazy understand what’s said.

[Red dots severe cases. dotted line indicates statistical significant clearly stating one factor among many. it’s time take facts. $150 1847 $4611 inflation so,

1.8m/4611 * 100 = 390

So that's 390% given bad No, assume exposure whole group random dosis im talking controlled exposure little virus people develop little symptoms. good science already kill anyone. 

Mutation problem seem confuse antibodies immunity. blood loses antibodies time memory make lasts many years. 

Vaccines course best solution take least year reach herd immunity longer anti vaxxers. can't lock whole winter.

The system much fragile imagine. civil war would kill many people virus. Please stop trying spread talking point.

For one thing, sound like trivializing people still dying covid. 

For another, death negative result disease. Tons people going health chronic health conditions decades shortened life expectancy after-effects. 

This something trying spread, like we're parents hosting chicken pox sleepover. Cut stop problem. Always positive troubling times! Love bro :) Nah lots places shut beginning pandemic low numbers result, none. US mass graves. guys far away cases and.way China. surprised US reaches million deaths. far away worst off, last place would want situation. Stop testing 0 new case!! Think smart think yugeeee winter Midwest. Georgian reporting in. protests / riots restaurants there’s something country watching. family virus July honestly people packing restaurants outdoor venues months now. I’ve often driven events thought there’s spike that.... thought opened way early (and never ever vote Kemp ways he’s navigated this) idk. surprised things don’t seem tragic here. 

I’m feeling less confident CDC ever before. Also kid college really think potential pockets good news could reported here. friend group tested positive antibodies point. sore throat could mean pretty much anything. Common cold, strep, r throat could dry, etc. normal illnesses still around, everything Covid.

Schedule test want know sure schedule doctors appointment. They’ll know better anybody Reddit. Captain Literal IMHO good way deal anti-lockdown/antimask folks give equivalent 10kus dollars 1month cruise. Condition must stay cruise 30 days test negative disembark.
This would give remaining people 1/2 brain, time deal virus Well obvious clue think shutting 2 weeks magically solve everything. probably think vanish Biden elected. #3 cause death lockdown quarantine measures too. “it’s flu” right? /S Look comments comment chain. [Aged like fine wine would holiday season really test absolutely stupid, selfish, incapable American general public accepting change.

So municipalities across country going go ahead trick treat stupid fucks ""feel normal"" it'll lead arise. couple weeks stupid fucks going feeding Turkey, passing virus infested dishes grubby ass hands around, laughing shouting arguing wine flows... lead rise. 

Fast forward month Christmas even stupid fucks can't feel normal get dumb ugly sweaters grandma pass presents around hug kiss sing dumbass carols ""goodwill toward men"" end back dinner table ham... it'll lead rise. Tack drunken new year morons days know what? really face darkest winter country long time. feel ""normal."" as?  Sweden's neighboring countries locking every month? Majority Americans complying care others. 30% dummies fuck everybody 1% truly represent statement. See, can’t tell you’re joking anti-mask grandfather sent article yesterday said Covid-19 Covid-21 part plot Satan get rid churches. scientists smart, aren’t rich?! theory segmented sleeps, people sleep two segments waking period them, normal. Modern society created 8 hour sleep cycle. Without connection modern society people reverting norm. Yes, setting disaster last months, seeding everywhere. healthcare system going massively overwhelmed. NY able get doctors nurses come really bad hot spot spring. Every locality time exploding everywhere once. I'm angry phrase ""don't dramatic"" that's like saying sad someone severe depression. saying life infinitely better us ignorant current problems currently, probably never able home house prices atm. Saying better others mean opinion feelings subject. fair Wuhan 11M people Hubei 58M. 

So 80k is.... bad percent population. Biden's plan virus? lockdown accomplished exactly? Also, ou suggesting US shouldnt holding elections? believe celebrities chronic long term conditions, hiding everyone? possible single cell produce both. Probably likely DNA virus RNA virus. since typically kills cell especially likely. People keep saying nobody immune novel coronavirus, never true. changed radically, least decade. Condoms strongly campaigned. SARS MERS confronted American leadership. countries handling Covid well learned Well anyway case I’ll move NZ Australia. Can’t live social distancing much longer. Imagine find COVID like measles cause encephalitis decade actual infection... 

I literally talk peoople like time 

Its deadly virus depopulate earth ALSO hyped everyone wears mask sheople can't think themselves. 

But wait ask...both can't true! Yes topsy turvy world right wing insanity. We’re #1! blame economic impacts started correctly assigned people accurately noted sensible measures taken you-know-who, instead correcting heinous inaction you-know-which group decided easier target people discussing factual occurrences ""biased detractors"" order protect image. I’ve also reading articles brain abnormalities COVID patients, terrifying all. they’ve literally school almost 12 weeks. cases school, yes. entire school shut down, no. 

Stop treating every area like really. mean .. people die Covid. know that.

But asking people suffering long term chronic complications Covid.

And public figures w heard got Covid wondering chronic complications?  Yea. Poverty soaring roof! wrong. true, AIDS patients able catch anything else viruswise, know false. said telling YOU, telling “anyone.” Yes, think it’s quite likely access private medical details friends friends. remember doctors coming early talking possibly losing 200k nothing done stop it. don’t know way back February, remember hearing number well. I’m sure got it, computer models? Prayers peace sent hospital staff,I could imagine. someone whose working special needs children high school, conditions bad,with cases,and quarantine, stress,and chaos every minute day trying stay safe overwhelming, could imagine hospital staff. Stay safe,and know praying you. kid amazing K/D rating happens Summer Camps, right? School environments provide temporary immunity virus, right?

At least germany, ""lockdown"" entails crowded public transportation school class rooms. still believe children can’t get virus even get it, definitely can’t spread it. sun rand liberty cruise Bah, OUTSIDE thing, fine. I'm seeing individual candy bags tables put together gloves mask on. Kids pick one table. big deal. *We can't take away shit NEED taken away.* Please posts links use link shorteners/re-routers obscure true destination link.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*   I'd like disable 10pm. I'm truly sorry kid got abducted 100 miles away, assure kid room. Probably answer article absurd exaggeration 

4,000 day? US ever saw 1,200/day highest many times larger pop 

that simply happen knew virus was/is real. He's neoliberal asshole getting low percentage positive tests... Currently average around 0.5% ... Biggest heard around 1% Give break, 

This angle shows 6 feet apart looks really motherfucking dense? immune basic logic? live there’s nothing going Unfortunately probably going way go now, great hey need stay safe obviously tier system working way wanted to. hope people stay calm go panic buying enough loo roll us all. put 170000$ fine. family fined *Too much personal freedom without personal responsibility balance it.* plot twist one saw coming, Trump telling people get get better immune. guy got top flight care taxpayer dime....you know, socialism. Zenaab, Endia bad people dying streets area? Everything normal town even cases “surging” words, us Americans retarded back now? Great see progress 3rd time he's presidential bid. wants president, milquetoast candidate problematic history literally going win bc COVID. Thnx. According Obama, trump administration likely used handbook prop table. Touché. people*... look excess deaths numbers, already obvious true. someone explain much emphasis put cases focus explaining people deaths etc 

I always see people lockdowns, mask wearing etc use argument media scre mongering using cases yard stick. #3 cause death year exist last year. That's big deal you? They're based bullshit stories happened stolen bullshit stories told people them, name leveraging control others.

Just like Scientology. Imagine thinking racist writing that? worries haven’t seen studies done protests summer? 

I’m genuinely curious coverage shifts whether it’s rally protest. someone point article explaining? Yes, great nation Europe. :/ Go see safe ways trick treat! science repeatedly said indoors people way dangerous touching something. Parents carry around bottle hand sanitizer give pump houses, slap mask baby, super careful- definitely done. middle school Halloween dance year busted ass give safe alternative. worth see happy :) times tough let kids this, go beyond safety precautions. Potentially, yes. heard Trump rallies indoors that's case, that's pretty appalling. That's boomer death camp I've ever heard one. Yes. example, actors insured projects. actor (especially big star), hoping get cast something next year, I’m sure would reveal chronic condition made working hard. imagine trying make movie someone often breath? Canceling shoots cost significant chunks money.

Also, believe not, people private blast life social media. it’s awkward translation. it’s clarifying fact one obviously close contact person they’re examined medical professional, otherwise one mustn’t close contact anyone. Give weeks. That’s literally works  Raw sooooo good! Yeah family zoom thanksgiving year. We’ll prepare dinners get call together dinner conversation like normal, video. It’s better nothing, much better inadvertently infecting family members. USA USA USA! #1 think wrong, worst case I’ll best move Australia NZ Denial world. lot arrogant narcissists country want inconvenienced. Hahaha yea one bad apple. 

Do even seriously believe comment? There's half million blacks incarcerated nonviolent offenses, thousands immigrant children locked cages permanently stolen children, Native Americans still forced live reservations without electricity running water, mention hundreds torture camps around world Muslims shed crocodile tears for. Nobody's forgotten one cheering torture innocent Uighers Guantanamo Bay. actually capacity think

Are sure? Refutation: America 2020. We’re really winning now. Look great become Hey guys, easy working together it! even close idiot. 220k+ dead thing everyone like continues downplay outright deny vs roughly 37k-ish deaths per year automobile accidents US. Trump lied, fuckton ppl died. know week so.  apologize. misread headline US instead UK... Stop moving goalposts, said they’re spaced appropriately anything proper mask usage something done already...VOTE marches outside, fair number masks people moving, know marching. Trump rallies inside, sometimes outside, masks,, people moving. Surprised even doctors mask moving made difference. 1000 Americans per day. happen patriotic ? caring fellow Americans? 1000 dead Americans per day nothing? Remindme! 30 days 4,000 UK deaths/day equivalent 19,700 deaths/day US 

its absurd never happen. stand that. Deaths aren’t moving. number one... One buddies turned 21 days ago lot friends gunna go bar night celebrate birthday/Halloween. I’m right you, I’d absolutely love go good time it’s worth it. love compares west east uses examples Taiwan South Korea models east although largely outliers successes it’s hard trust data east anyways.

If fucking Americans wore masks got shit together, wouldn’t issue. HI EVERYBODY! guess money important life?maybe look masks cover nose, hang let you.Masks worn nose mouth. Masks especially important difficult stay least 6 feet apart others people indoors help protect other.
""Masks may slow spread virus help people may virus know transmitting others
Wearing mask helps protects others case you’re infected, others wear one protect infected."" Directly CDC's website, believe me, fine, live like idiot. ""Why take three years learn scam people?????!!!""

\- American realtors everywhere. people intend spread name Mammon Freedom, people sacrificed. call blue supporters name ""tard"" end, right?! 

The sad thing get million dead (which 0.5% fatality 60% US gets this) another 2 million long-term effects, that's 3 million Americans 300 million. 

Let's say 3 million know 20 people. That's ""only"" 60 million people, 1 5. leaves 80% keep saying overblown political.

It's infuriating.  That's well put, bravo great reply good following continuing passion. never thought perspective, science cool popular, cares. kind see politics well, people follow political news really understand/care understand politics, pick political ""team"" defend emotion only.

I'll admit terrible high school student poorly science classes growing up, pivoted college later life. feel college taught think make decisions actual topic classes. one thing that, me, wild lack critical thinking exhibited individuals. Social media tells masks effective COVID fake, agree without forming opinion frightening. Talking heads news social media generally motivations saying things say, understanding words thoughts need taken grain salt terrifying state affairs. ""Nuremberg defense"" months masked life would dramatically improve situation could get full-scale adoption instead huge swath people maliciously flaunting disregard common sense civil responsibility. know sure immune best assume nobody is. USA! 🇺🇸 jk keep seeing people mention surge 
in cases doesnt mean anything deaths arent spiking. example, guy reddit posted tweet this. Here's text said. 

 ""If look around. look countries. Cases skyrocketing, deaths not. Casestemic. Pandemic. March. Government Scientists going stop bad science?""

Now careful since thing started obvious but, also girlfriend little high risk. Honestly making question believe. I've seen people say scientists need stop fake science. I've seen people saying big deal fake. dont know hard get truth virus could end someone's life. Meanwhile, Gallatin County: elementary schools going back five days week person starting Monday. 🤦‍♀️😐👎👎👎 Hey now, that's legal let include ""the people"" end phrase. always ""to serve protect""... (themselves). Lol global population grown whole thing.

Despite general consensus sub apocalypse aren’t many people dying compared total global population almost 8 billion. Honestly - choice life expectancy 65 living world socially distance forever leave house essentials, take lower life expectancy. understand latter Reddit user’s normal lives.  6% deaths covid covid alone lol keep living fear lib certainly hasnt gained vote him

I'm afraid incorrect. family reluctantly voted Hillary fully Trump train. ones. There's many people country vote *because* he's unpopular. particularly like politics vote simply huge amount hate him. either think must something right piss many people, think they're special going grain ..i know why. curious proudly actually admit voted 20 years line, they'll ashamed it.  easily effectively internet.

Unless single working parent really care China also face backlash pandemic. west, Asian countries already skeptical wary China centuries (including territorial disputes). China certainly challenges set out. think lot pundits west underestimating that. remarkable sad, used lot interesting discussion reddit perspectives. incredibly one sided lacking kind possibility discuss depth add nuance. dimensionless rabble, pretty much predict exactly get voted get real discussion not. Every top comment controversial topic, political not, usually lacks kind actual content basically repeating empty platitudes. ones comment immediately cleary signal ""side"" gets buried, even supporter controversial opinion all.

Sad state affairs imo. even know get decent discussion anymore except IRL. Maybe term “regional immunity” less controversial Reddit:)

If US starts hitting 100,000 cases daily three months, can’t imagine regional immunity DOESNT start form places point pandemic you’ve lost sense smell experiencing respiratory symptoms don’t think need test, predict result almost 100% accuracy (positive) Kisudvarnok Right. it’s ridiculous, alarmist prediction encourages submission. Man absolutely love new unit measurement. countries got cases much peaks. Go look linear line cases US compared others. nothing flat line. consistent uptrend, countries go up, go flat considerable amount time, again. literally two countries larger populations US. Vietnam? MUCH densely populated, 100 million people local cases two months life back normal. Yea hit anywhere close yet? Everywhere scenario follows. Restrictions relaxed, cases rise, restrictions reimposed, cases drop. delay effectiveness restrictions relaxed reimposed. It’s cycle that’s gone it’s course 3 4 times now. don’t see places accepting exponential rise cases. Also state Washington low numbers throughout don’t see could spiraling exponential growth unless get floods sick people. states control restrictions won’t time 50 states dramatic case rises without least governors reimposing restrictions. almost like body knows do. riots protests appear take seriously, chief  6% deaths covid alone read hate framed way. loud minority power base west crushing us all. can't name post gets deleted us want handled properly willing wear masks needs done. held hostage grown men women acting like fucking middle schoolers right now. Well, guess since Americas saw practice human sacrifice order try keep power society. Thank you. one seems consider immune system trying kill protect rest humans enemy can’t understand. seems like pretty safe assumption increased transmission.

Protests majority people wearing masks, whereas majority Trump rally attendees wear masks packed relatively closely. Also, [comprehensive correlational showed anything NEGATIVE correlation state protest participation percent increase summer cases. protests significantly increased cases, least positive correlation.

I think 2020 - especially Trump wins - might end seen time democracy terminally went fashion. Especially first past goalpost democracies managed go almost completely retarded past decade, performance reinforcing narrative suck.

The West larger whole little complex that, especially given even anglosphere, successes failures (alas, 2 biggest ones big failures).

I also quite ready blame pretty hard US. US EU come together agreed simply squashing COVID completely, suspect could done. EU close relationship US hence trying eliminate US even trying would seemed massive waste money - would gotten back US point anyway.  Australia NZ generally considered part West.

Is saying exceptionalism etc. infected western Europe USA Australia? so, Australia avoid this?

That’s aren’t really much restrictions traveling cities/states US. new case detected NZ, Australia similar countries, they’re detected pretty quick means citizens continue living normal lives. fair fair, it’s pretty obvious weather blessing. anytime peak summer protests happening, I’d bet would disaster. You’re dumb think young, politically engaged BLM protestors don’t overwhelmingly take Covid seriously Trump rally attendees.

There actual science discussing gatherings impacted Covid case numbers. would cool read that’s probably much ask given you’ve already made mind. 1,500 Americans get together masks coming called medical system trajectory collapse. think thing everyone's mind right many students similar situations stories known. scary part student RA! should, that’s joke right now

Alright. Exactly, care money people, that's clear now. Indeed, back-tracked REAL QUICK released said something admin aiming end term, definitely ""rounding corner virus"". Still utter bullshit. Yes, account Twitter: NYC. least beat flu. Literally 0 cases now. Congrats team! Bay Area, CA here.

Literally protest photo show guarantee find multiple people wearing masks wearing incorrectly. whoever shouting megaphones almost always mask chinstrap mode. Something doesn’t involve perpetuating left / right paradigm should. half many reported tests (40,000ish) prior day's reported tests (80,000ish) half many positive cases makes sense. Everything conspiracy. Exactly I’m eager get flu shot building right now. Nobody wears fucking mask right agree locking goal eradicating virus practical solution western societies, reasons mentioned. said, lockdowns need necessitate eradication order work. China, think ever plan.

The goal would simply suppress cases level spread traced infected could isolated. goes tremendous way keeping spikes happening without excessive intrusion personal freedoms. addition, hospitals would also stockpile supplies said lockdown.

""There 'new normal'.""


In optimistic view, means there's sufficient immunity make transmission rates low, ""crisis"", would still need keep wearing face coverings, extra careful hand hygiene socially distance.


""And stay used years decades really settle down. second wave absolutely end it.""

Masks social distancing decades guys. Welcome new normal. Well people need vote accordingly. data said, conspiracy leftist cucks reading responses asking? plenty instances listed thread answer question. Basically, people afraid go outside fear getting attacked, protests riots ""helped"". That's impressive mental gymnastics. get people might feel way, aren’t seeing people around getting sick dying turn think it’s big deal. People aren’t able see bigger picture reason realize it’s bigger individual.

Also, people Trump rallies likely older, surrounded friends family similar beliefs also don’t take Covid seriously, etc etc.

This isn’t rocket science. maybe still much figure out. what? virus? entity bringing whole human race peg Don’t forget “they’re testing more” excuse strategy currently really putting eggs ""vaccine save us"" basket even though still guaranteed thing.

Also isn’t working bunch people “The Platinum Plan” addressing inequality protested? 500b available capital minority business owners sounds nice me. Woah, anyone else get deja vu? claiming administration effectively ended deadly disease 

This done event lose, blame next spike cases next administration flip agenda ""we tried help stopped us"" BS Get cherry picking outta Sort controversial good times. Good point Shut fuck lol ... far. quick Yes, that’s correct. Russian roulette this? horrible false equivalency. 

We can’t shut country again. People wear masks, take common sense precautions, people still die. Even southern town 70%+ likely voting trump, people wear masks everywhere, isn’t much done besides another ill-advised total lockdown. people want gather friends family, it’s right. 

If lockdown people way would shut country cases zero. thanksgiving gatherings, Christmas gatherings, etc. feasible would benefits outweigh costs.

FTFY

The difference MASKS covid spreading imbecile. Dude shut estimates fucking accurate they're based FACTS SCIENCE. remember Sturgis 250k people died? one event counts deaths far!! viruses come end world?

This completely wrong. 2009 H1N1 virus came Mexico. MERS came Saudi Arabia (in camels originally). Ebola HIV came Africa. There's also real concern factory farming (which also exist US) seed next epidemic.

Viruses come anywhere world. Viruses borders. news told trump rallies. I'm good boy. make want leave country. funny two comments ""of course not!"" within 5 minutes come along Question everyone. everything. Dang curious state. Idaho almost 35% positivity. 700 deaths? would care that? It’ll hardly make dent poll numbers. nothing value lost 😂 Pure incompetence. necessarily deliberate. Oh, brains exploded, believe me. little cunt Nah masks. Damn near everyone participating wearing one, event organizers encouraging it, people even handing out. Many protesters also wore would prevent identified video. really nothing weather time year.

Trump rally’s hand...almost one wearing mask Trump holds indoors get away it. Waking up? 3 pretty much go sleep now. nursing shortage it’s going crisis. would want nurse point? El Paso teetering edge healthcare collapse scenario right now, happen think area safe it? personal opinion everyone trying aim upper limit ""reasonable"" isolation individual situation. me, isolation easy; work remotely; enough green space around; Great cats wife; constant state lock pretty sure maintain indefinitely. 

What reasonable me, unreasonable others and, opinion, encourage push limits without pushing people ""I can't take more, give up"" phase. Thoughts?

Also, add ""wash hands/try touch face"" list instructions. That’s true, said “in short time frame.” conversation talking risks susceptible flu still recovering Covid (or vice versa).  examples people could financially retire want *there's nothing do* wearing masks couldn’t identified CCTV cameras breaking target. exactly best reason wear mask. Nah, countries actual lockdowns. Specifically Cyprus curfews going outside house permits limited essential workers day less hour specific reasons (groceries etc.) fricking clue numbers going India.

I happy almost 50% would see fell. I'll let know let people burn whatever want city people get covid..

You can't say fact much protests spread covid study done. Mandela Effect taught anything people would rather believe they've hopped alternate universe admit wrong something. I’m one saying it. Professor Woolhouse is. quote posted clear day. long continue follow science, wearing masks social distancing years, decades according professor article. Maybe it’s time stop living denial. dont disagree, sort missing point. saying throw massive world wide party day vaccine comes. Although would awesome. efforts costing worth? infected rate goes down, importantly death rates, point becomes meaningless everyone hide away home?

Of course, also question going back normal means. problem people forced stay home symptoms, always case. problems action taking place areas virus grows control. cant five years people staying home death tolls hopefully start dropping. waiting virus disapper completely might well give now.  self evident seasonality one of- the- important determinants virus spreads. I'm sure many people watching China winter great interest. overwhelmed, Florida’s hospitals handled really well without shutdown. However that’s likely never shut first place, enough people already immunity summer spike, shows lockdowns ever done, lockdowns make people get virus it’s reopened. Europe commits mistake again. would watch Netflix Yeah, point — massively worse Covid, society basically carried around them. cannot see scenario people prohibited seeing friends family members decades go ""OK, totally worth it."" Agree 'civil war', Italy Spain(and Britain) also)are showing us, people getting sick tired lockdowns take much protests exist countries. It’s likely part routine blood work. There’s always standard tests go hospital regardless you’re ""here go again"" N95 nothing? Aresst anyone would die too. people rallies culpable is. Wow. Must pretty crazy considering one really thought gonna happen. figured formed AFSPC. Probably confusing process sounds fun! Can’t statistics you’re allowed ask. saw posted multiple times reddit too. Clarified\* Trump neoliberal deregulation tax cuts Hahahahah people delusional. actual scientist saying that. 

Whether something society support, another question. Well, shit. Ditto. really left quarantine since live somebody immunocompromised exposing risky areas kind something avoid. 

But yeah, everybody's tired rules restrictions place included complacency hurts whole thing. continue many things pandemic going helping bit there's people refuse hold large gatherings, wear masks distance on. Ok protests? actually testing vitamin everybody gets hospitalized? find hard believe. Piece shit deranged. lose. That's 100% case. completely shoulders Frostburg State mishandling situation: Allegany, Garrett, Washington County Health Departments holding multiple testing days quick provide much information can. colleges areas. college across border WV reporting testing results right away too.

Even lock today, weeks numbers stop climbing, let alone come back reasonable level (reasonable American standards still joke). wait hospitals overwhelmed, cases continuing increase weeks overwhelmed. Like everything life, pros cons kids going school. Since Europeans turned coronavirus political issue, examine issue intelligently. 

They made decision prioritize education. reasonable decision better children worse old people. US states decided prioritize either young old slogans rather critical thought. never heard deadly disease eventually became less deadly everybody either died got antibodies. ever happened?

Seriously. amount shrill wailing strikes concern trolling parents want deal responsibilities children. Interesting hospitalizations much lower counties mask mandates then. would explain that? alternative? Hard lockdown every time hospitals hit capacity? said, lack many features desire....

When think getting covid, think outcome (unless really lonely hermit).

You must assume high probability people household close contacts get it.

To me, completely unacceptable outcome wife dies becomes disabled severely ill. risk unacceptable outcome single person risk.

The missing piece estimates contribution interaction comorbidities.

For example age hypertension highly correlated, age hyper tension separately risk factors severe covid19. interaction?

The lack web sites references got parameters error bars them. (Or even better estimate distribution parameter i.) ?

Also example, Hendra virus first discovered Malaysia nothing done bats Brisbane found (its named suburb found in). didn’t get warning anything. husband immuniosurpessed too.. (Chemotherapy)..

Three things think - first, flu far less communicable COVID, second, death rate, coming far higher, 10 x high (0.1% vs 1%, higher) flu nearly everyone recovers flu within two weeks without long term problems percentage COVID least 20%, estimates far higher.  

So compare COVID flu, vaccine maybe 60% effective, get less it, unless wear masks, socially distance, contact trace, isolate, virus us while. precise, 7-day average **47% POSITIVE** say half kidding certainly feels like it, still lot strict guidelines.

I think governments knowing wrong public tolerate full lockdown realise there's alternative. Us too! drops Vit kids oatmeal every morning husband take Vit Omega 3 pills dinner. We’re huge taking supplements pandemic we’re staying top it. highly Vitamin deficient 35

I figure dont use share neighbors donate food pantry (everything expiration dates beyond 2022). enforced? public comply it? Tell me, force someone labor unless them? forcing anyone anything saying ""you choices, they're choices"" meaning them. 

Sorry, debatable topic. Forced labor slavery ownership. virus absolutely oreveleant know. 

The estimates 1 10 globally gotten this. 

725mm people. kids sitting home without access computer even phone video functioning that's crazy.

It massive failure country kids access November.

It massive failure. believe supposed damage done ""underlearning"" year pandemic can't fixed later life.

You're missing key point here, already underprivileged children disadvantage *during best times*, getting behind makes future outlook even grimmer.

And binary issue able afford piece technology, barrier success here. internet good enough home? many rural areas country, answer no. living arrangement conducive even feasible schooling home? fed? Many children rely meals provided public school system least one meals.

Surely, hopefully, issues addressable, three denying children needing help normal circumstances stand lose current circumstances.

As someone fully support containment measures including remote learning, issues see need addressed continue distance learning vaccine widely available. waver back forth lot. US least, we're seeing nearly levels death hospitalizations saw back March whatever reason, despite case numbers higher then. thing keeps coming back looking total deaths. 220K deaths virus 9 months normal situation. That's something brushed off. 1K deaths/day, that's track ~360K/year, wayyyyy worse cold flu outbreak we've seen century.

I think hospitals need necessarily overflowing ICU patients like Lombardy March still problem. still crisis, absolute catastrophe could been.

If got to, say, 200 deaths per day US, would likely agree redditor. Yeah. fake. need real dictatorship. NP. Back atcha, ma’am! That's west especially US diverse dominant culture expectations integration hold social fabric together like many Asian countries have. easier hold people accountable empathy neighbor look like behave like you. West absolute shit job social planning. collection competing tribes rather unified society wear mask inside got symptoms? We're rounding corner right. Y'know, would agreed this, think less makes sense me. 

Australia New Zealand part West, handling impeccably. Several European countries also well, namely Nordic countries sans Sweden.

Meanwhile, Japan's cases surging again, Philippines, Indonesia, lesser extent, Malaysia. Africa's testing rate low make kind assessment. 

So, based we've seen, trend appears isolated countries took seriously early reaping rewards now, rather actual East-West divide. article seems reaching something there, least clear says. got wannabe dictator fuck damn country up. continues. can't fix mess made. surprise.

You defending every form forced labor really forced. According you, millions forced laborers around world actually forced anything.

Let guess, [you kanye Cool. many people camps, smartass? Go show transparent CCP friends data. I'll waiting right non-secretive figures come. I'm sure open honest numbers prisoners held coronavirus figures. 

Remember, China ever 85,000 infections December May increases since May. agree numbers CCP possibly lie many infections took place, could they? Everyone reddit would know truth second.

People masking properly, distance households etc. line wasn’t long either, saw approx 10-12 people waiting outside average Germans putting people containers regulating air supply? AGAIN? 🤔 Summers camp know! Heres thing though. would show people true IFR listed listed CDC another comment instead current fear mongering showing huge cases acting assumption deadly originally feared back March, guarantee overwhelming people would accept odds. recognize everything life deadly. 

Give people real numbers let make decision issue guidance instead withholding it, showing scary stuff mandating certain response. Take upvote use 'augur.' subtile use subtile word. Downvoted Truth.

It's sad, fact disease isnt deadly enough scare majority people right thing. mention deadly enough warrant economic recessions already predicted lead hundred million deaths critically impoverished nations due lack donations support EU US. Horrifying say? live Skåne County, work hospital, 1.3 million people major restrictions hade 290 deaths total year. Unfortunately media giving picture Sweden disaster. jail something mean forced. 

Then millions forced laborers ignoring. look artisinal small scale mining people put say suffering enough considered forced labor.

I originally thought saying forced labor as.bad slavery, really saying far worse far evil. saying slavery one going kill paying taxes.

No one going kill millions forced laborers either, ar still suffering.

For example, seamen talking post. According nothing wrong going through. vast majority instances, forced labor enforced via threat death - slavery, ownership individuals actual life. 

No isn't. need educate yourself. like read anything posted explaining bondage slavery, one reason illegal US. 

But threat jail, said count forced labor. according you, debt bondage legal, right? forced labor slavery?

I cannot believe ok child miners Africa really forced. Lol real smart guy here, voting comment without reading it. Let rephrase response since previous one apparently deleted deemed uncivil,.. 8(

Yes, somehow US apparently worse shape China beginning year. time, President Trump publicly accused China downplaying threat misleading international community. time  stated journalist thread much worse anyone officially knew time. ""almost cases"" though. midwest spikes meat processing plants issues like that. going die. hearing stories church events, trick treating without measure. neighborhood trying safely, think better prohibiting it. People want regular english cannot understand it... ambiguous...

you said ""Jesus also called Son God God called Son. Dunno proof need.""

that means jesus god, son god can't actually mean anything else.  holy spirit everyone everything. 
 
jesus pray himself.  resurrect take heaven.  someone else did. simple...   

they invented particular beliefs much later.  jews, mulims non-trinitarians would like word  

edited, incomplete, manipulated, inaccurate used lots evil... that's bible.  need it. need invented beliefs. need good person. dont know anyone believe this. fair, last decade flu killed people Covid-19. Schools ain’t closing little bastards keep virus moving even everything else closed [The UK lockdown right decision, considering huge increases deaths.

Hopefully *this* time, ease quickly! Think there's correlation respective governors response numbers? 🍄 No. It’s law deportation plan, virus death rate would higher... jus saying. Dumbass. bothered calculate overall IFR CDC data? 0.7%. 

You still answer question. state country managed keep widespread community transmission populations? can't suggestion already proven empirically impossible.

We 3 states hospitals struggling already. happens throw fuel fire mom dies appendicitis local hospital bed? argument monumentally fucking stupid dangerous. Stop pushing disinformation get people killed. assumption back March know dealing with. Hospitals medical personnel experience dealing symptoms virus death rate likely dropped result.

Also, general population kind knows expect far symptoms go, less people likely going hospital unless start experience severe symptoms. Melbourne big signs local pharmacy, asked one said needed prescription. stopped reading "" know estimate means""

For real . read Parents often better even FDs print. much due encouraging people eat help pandemic? honest, think folks bit cautious sturgis motorcycle rally. Here's video shows serious folks took covid course, things bad, want believe good news. guess: no.  Family member corona contact tracing since start pandemic. Children hardly spread virus often final stop family catches virus. child infects another one often one class hardly ever infect family members. true children, teens. Around 14 longer true all.

Another family member works immuno-compromised children virus spreading nurses, hardly young patients get disease ones really get sick.

Allowing children go school allows parents focus home, means productivity get big hit go offices work. good economy decreasing office infections.

I understand caution, young children hardly anything points need cautious. would love see go police officer see deal daily basis. guarantee change attitude.  Kids deal shit rest humanity does

It's *really* important everyone knows repeats lot. Pretty much anti-masker science (and fox news, whitehouse guy) rests **fact** mask great protecting getting sick. not.


But great stopping getting others sick. I'm distancing. I'm wearing mask. I'm gonna pretend like virus death sentence, ridiculous. much can. Unfortunately travel flat I’m moving of, flat I’m moving weeks bathroom running water. I’m sure this’ll fix it! cares said. thing done virus, stay way. There's prevention cure. thing governments enforce lockdowns. buy time, get R value down, prevent spread. That's best public health response is, imperfect difficult is. Australia, move freely safely around city. know, though, countries communities can't enforce easily could, island nation.

It's awful, anyone, government's fault. Noone really solution. think US tad bit overzealous it, there's middle ground somewhere almost downside. What’s difference? Ron swanson exact type fight mask mandate closure good public. day testing positive, Pazuello met right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro hotel room, social media video showing two chatting without masks. Bolsonaro recovered bout COVID-19 July...  pandemic, two successive health ministers resigned roughly span month, part physicians, themselves, would fully endorse chloroquine. Pazuello, active-duty Army general without medical degree, expanded access chloroquine allowed prescribed virtually anyone tests positive coronavirus.

So health minister tout medication work order keep job.

You can't make stuff up, folks one made prediction me.

Thats fine good probably isnt spreading point. one wears mask hanging friends. People fucking idiots. Find next time! months prepare first wave. They’ve half fucking year prepare second. That's public health works. CDC US recommend schools open. They're public health infectious diseases factors much influence mortality morbidity. public think experts they're barely regurgitating 2 weeks worth content epi 101. School important, social interaction. might mantra anyone science, UK government begin recommend mask wearing mid May, mandatory shops 24th July. hardly saw anyone wearing them. Early actually recommending wearing them. live south east coast United States. Masks enforced here, someone forgets mask wearing one inside store/restaurant/whenever, looked like monster. Surprising considering I'm smack dab Bible belt. people shit would go forever. much goalposts moved I'll believe reopening happen see it.   Sure.

D2 add milk. vegan D2 made plants. beginning exactly experts predicted, general lockdown cut numbers, sporadic lockdowns vaccine. Use vitamin reserves...? Yep, compulsory enforced, so...…not compulsory? never saw anyone get fined wearing one either, even police walked past mask less shoppers NY discouraging it. town drive-thru thing substitute volunteered help. think fun, safe, substitute, people wore masks overall seemed happy. vote current president. Neither Americans. asking politely. anything know test vitamin levels home? taking supplement would really like know levels at. Vigilant bad optics, sure. ""states rights"" easier sell non-racists ""deny black vote."" Vigilant defense bad optics automatically mean they're also wrong. people would home sick, productivity would collapse. fact schools, colleges universities stay open really defies point. can't see many people education taking seriously sit classroom many hours day social distancing, moment step school grounds, allowed mix - within school, could even technically hug! mad... sounds right

see comment added NOS article nytimes article referring mostly children. parents pay attention vitamins children get. Children getting rickets. Vitamin milk solved it. fatality rate .3%... they’d probably 100k deaths Italy though care. see getting repercussions actions. parent ? Get rid guy!!! idiots voted brexit two half hour late press conference, tells everything really bit hidden cost lockdown astronomical. 100,000 fewer cancer diagnoses compared yearly average that’s look illnesses aren’t diagnosed treated, child abuse disclosures tripled last lockdown, suicides thousands average, domestic abuse rampant, mental health issues caused isolation, increased alcoholism due locked home 24/7, people losing jobs thousand meaning people losing homes falling poverty. Poverty one key contributors ill health. Surely factors outweigh gains lockdown? Restrictions measures undoubtedly necessary, can’t let virus run rampant, full lockdown damaging society health. idea household got it, since work home, maskless contact anyone outside home weeks, washed hands thoroughly consistently, socially distanced much possible whenever need go stores anywhere public.

Any hope reliably contact tracing isolating virus obliterated back spring states reopened 4-6 weeks, without ever hiring enough people perform tracing, without ramping testing massive levels. I'm surprised got it, disappointed sufficient mass unconscionable stupidity exists within nation destroy possibility public health. CDC scientific institutions? stop distributing info news? way previous quarantine rules enforced. Heavy fines, little enforcement. 

There $10,000 fine caught breaking travel rules. However, nobody’s job enforce this. Community members report people breaking quarantine rule, proof, traveler fined. read one instance girl posted photos social media breaking quarantine, reported fined. get wrong, I'm definitely excusing behavior, think better try understand it. experience, find helpful look victims (they are, way, unfortunately case stupid also endanger others) cite bike one, sounds crazy would like read C'mon, decent government would postponed pushing controversial law. exactly wanted avoid mass protests. country becoming less democratic bet pandemic stop me. Exactly WONT WORK. Unless we’re rounding people throwing jail work. haven’t achieved 100% seat belt compliance won’t achieve 100% mask/lockdown compliance. won’t people face reality stop acting like people would “just take seriously.” NEW PLAN PLEASE. always thought utarded ( hehe, wife utah, midwest, live southern Utah... always called them, hated it... year starting come around making sense) people northern hemisphere get. Lockdown significantly easier winter months, summer, people travelling holidays wanting active major factor movement spread.

Ask people hibernate moving mindset anyway becomes extension seasonal behaviour. think he’s talking mass distribution I'm sure spend minutes sub conclude one saying that. spike again.  Ron Swanson said, “I hate public, public stupid”. that. Sweden significantly higher infection rate. Right, also shouldn’t dismiss “everyone vitamin deficient.” true, perhaps vitamin plays bigger role combatting coronavirus things, maybe it’s virtually meaningless. end day, safe smart course keep appropriate levels Believe not, things taken consideration precautionary screening done thoroughly beforehand; could perfectly fine thing kids, everything would gone swimmingly.  


Kids deal shit rest humanity 24/7 basis. Summer camp would perfect way get kids home bit adults pull hair small clumps. 


So again, proper precautions, would problem. BUT, ONE kid got 116 people sick, people going take attitude towards mine. that's really sad. $500 fine won’t work wealthy. would deter poor middle class. You’d Instagram influencers using 405 California drag racing. $500 nothing them. I'm cedar city, born raised ohio native. I've always every called utards. utarded. fits best IMHO. Whataboutism response? that. think TIME it’ll work? Without Pearl Harbor US would’ve like oh well, good here....nothing’s really changed feel ya. That’s hard 99% people life feel way. It’s like telling less write everyone life find new family friends. It’s hardest part year me. feel utterly alone. still walk shops, supermarkets, anything like. least London. one enforcing anything. disgraceful. post stated simple, supportable fact. good reason existed downvote remove post. uncomfortable fact still fact. civil course action would debate it, suppress it. predict virus go extinct tomorrow, Donny withdraw election, we’ll hold hands sing kumbaya. 

What? Predictions randos don’t hold weight?  true number 40% hasn’t. It’s proven measures aren’t effective, whatever reason doesn’t matter WHY, seasonality huge factor.  don’t lock all. Since know coming back difference people get poorer poorer elderly still dies. party poopers don’t see using military. He’ll barely enough clout use federal agents. he’ll give financial incentives states shut down. hate Trump almost everything stands - I’m single-issue voter now, lockdown. 

And Biden lockdown candidate. people self righteous aren’t you? I’ll bet told teacher student didn’t put pencil timed test. virus going whatever wants regardless people do. Go back look ignorant comments months back said countries locked got right. Well, turns didn’t matter huge outbreaks also. “Experts” changed recommendations mandates still doesn’t matter. sub nothing doom scrolling easily frightened faux educated. Many us living lives best taking sensible precautions. still going spread worldwide lockdown going stop it. America destroying good thing. Thank service greater global good. did. said found spine. lot former colleagues upset did. Agreed. special needs students, particularly social anxiety, thrived online. black white situation, teachers support staff simply perpetuate inexperience fact. expect voted common sentiment teachers expendable babysitters. Public comply got fired first lockdown? fired march jobs taking right now. Plus, every company yet another workload pushed top already heavy workload less people less benefits. wage get 80% of, since recently, sight job. point I’d move example good person hope change choice. Note- name added enough characters post video. approved previously. Near zero die! Womp womp. long people actually jobs once, extremely easy. Yeah, unlike Trumps dumbass, they're testing ENTIRE POPULATION. US tested everyone, even close. probably closer 200-300k day counted asymptomatic carriers. Wibble wobble economy destruction? fair, considering attacks balls, could still cause sterility younger people, havent spent long enough virus know long term effects Great. won. stop now!? Wait... sounds surreal. Deaths lag confirmed cases 3-4 weeks. dont know anywhere would legally fly. ""It causes distress smoke public place"", ""It causes distress murder someone"" saying make sense all. states already part US. Yes, people want right thing without coerced. Yeah right, meant safer jobs really days. Tough times. 61?

how 61x 10000? get that. don’t. don’t really know make understand it. thinks it’s different flu. yeah, 99% survival range. understand it’s hard someone see different. approach be? everyone gets flu left without safety measure essentially everyone would catch this? leader freedom shit Try enforce Texas New York, let know goes New York Times publishes fairytales? pretend ""god"" know things going turn out. That's great think allow back away slowly...

You claim cases rising know positive tests up. number course irrelevant given matters many people tested. FHM estimates around 10% peak infection rate earlier year 

Are cases rising? claim, feel free substantiate it, although since I'm 😁. work 50% PA can't stop going get away families whatever thought go bar for. Lots people visiting returning home holidays. Serum levels everything. body retain nutrient levels blood longer tissues blood vital. tested normal blood protein, hindsight know fact protein deficient time. Imagine another 10-20% permanently disabled covid-19 long hauler ... put lot stress system... fact caught already illustrates hard catch. Yep! dad said big country impossible enforce. He's wrong though. hard. damn hard. I’m New Yorker. ground zero. can’t begin fathom everyone else country thinking. New York problem? north east problem? easy coast problem? fucking everywhere problem! transmission hasn’t reached small Oklahoma town yet doesn’t mean it’s fucking free all. means “yet”. shit going touch every community country somehow it’s twisted malformed misdirected political agenda. It’s appalling. even people getting lax “tired” fucking inconvenience. shit going apocalyptically bad come winter. Yep. point far control, large portion populace fatigued precautions, I'm sure public health measures effective

To make matters worse, absolute earliest could expect federal government begin following epidemiologists advice would late January likely already worst it. partial herd immunity many high density areas. - also mask wearing still common. I'd say around 70%, 95% last month Lol, wish. place worked years went under. prepped well February. savings income so. Idk I'll pay rent tomorrow buy groceries time, let alone replace back stock. So, know, good plan, it. covid outliers over, pretty much find research support whatever narrative want believe covid.

However, really seem middle road majority scientists support, that's follow. YMMV. Wow, seems like incredibly contagious virus that’s supremely difficult contain, also isn’t deadly - ourselves, again?  Fauci certainly saying, “Everything okay.” once. saying opposite, lately he’s saying fact real trouble. U.S. would likely require constitutional amendment order federal government vested power lock individual states way. free movement citizens states never questioned. constitutional amendment would require 2/3rds majorities houses Congress ratification 3/4s states. Impossible given political polarization, even votes, would take year pass it.

It’s fair criticize fact set system way nobody ever tried anything pandemic, virus appeared way change it. Australian playbook would unconstitutional U.S. saying callous thing grandma died COVID-19 infection. Right Fall/winter always lockdown needed. understand trying curb first comes borders actually horrifically bad infecting people left right. initial lockdowns addition trying get hospitals support needed also try avoid fall wave happening fall wave potential doomsday scenario contained. don’t know basic medical fact doesn’t mean everyone lacks knowledge make decisions. Morphine doesn’t help raise oxygen levels. That’s common sense.

Edit: explain morphine helps pain decreasing respiration like collapsed lungs. ""muh freedoms"" crowd politicized mask wearing every public health measure extent states refusing use police departments refusing enforce them. see many young people hear someone social circle getting $1000 fine. Young people might taking advantage lax nonexistent enforcement, ""freedom"" people [filing eliminate entirely. 

And course benchmark Instagram, going see young people. He's junior high virtual learning feel pretty good situation especially mom understands science follows necessary precautions. Stay safe! ""Citizens find 'glimmers hope' governments lockdown require broad statewide quarantines 3 weeks, subsidizing one month median income""

FTFY Girl 😂😂 true all. Many cases people pre existing conditions non life threatening conditions. normally survive though. read zip lines too, lol. Covid challenge many people exhausted right now. hard time parent...well, harder usual time, guess. best wishes fun!  Thank Melburnians 
(From Canberran) Thanks teaching little ones... salute you. Thank service!! Well, yeah. like said: 'em, many us used 'em, extent. birth control pill deal pregnancy issue. Also sponge around back then. cumulative mindset self-centered people like are.

It's ok, 1000 people die, since someone know fuck right? could get 6 packets 18 rolls thanks panic buyers. Jobs, foods, services serious concern, bragging going party that's ""fine"" blaming white privilege nowhere... wtf? way around? Yep, people need realize herd infection equal herd immunity. read early trials caused grade 3 side effect 4 45 healthy 3 means can’t work would ideally someone else care provide care. Obviously less bad worst outcomes covid wonder whether really suitable majority population. miracle curve flattened night stopped rising US could still sustain 100‘000 new infections (and 1000 deaths) 8 years. 

(Yes, herd immunity would start kicking years economy collapsed.) UK doesn’t rely ‘tourist dollars’ americans self restraint. look obesity rate example. buy consume nation.

I think that's Americans incapable self restraint. think media constantly tells buying things make happy.

And buying things make happy, think maybe bought enough. It’s case Finland. cases school. Flu death rates always higher covid, every year, yet lockdowns lives getting ruined job losses business losses etc

This year however flu dropped 98%

Now it’s covid 

Sure it’s W coincidence though, that’s news say, right sheep? bronze, get switching game on. Yes. many people think 'it's bad' 'it's hype' 'it affect family'. Boris credibility goodwill Cummings fiasco.

Plus presser shit. People confused that's nothing new he's handled this. agree schools key transmission location rebuttal babysitter comment, yes another route transmission would much smaller risk school hundred thousand kids workers direct routes families. Babysitter/nanny would small group one one risk transmission would greatly less pandemic April so, people moved lives.

Nuh-uh. pandemic still ongoing, strong March. fact people keep pretending (ex. Czech Republic, southern America, White House narrative, etc.) helps drive numbers right back again. always take step two backwards take mask talk me. rarely get hint, like think subconscious part mind recognizes they're something wrong. Plz bright ideas insurgents feel bad Americans staying home, wearing masks social distancing. 

Unfortunately many fellow countrymen literally lives fellow Americans. eating inside restaurant, need mask according policy! One wave, three peaks (so far). winter coming. Maybe yet seen worst it. dont know troll or? Given recent historical trends, I'm optimistic talking herd immunity, OP said everyone it. Soo summary can’t tell I’m putting anyone risk. Got it, thanks  Ah. Black Friday. sad, considering 220,000 people died.

Heck, specific man caught it, tone changed.

At least moron changed tune. Measles infection rate almost hundreds time higher.

Not true.

Measles r0 12-18, whereas SARS-CoV-2 r0 5.7.

Corona Queens Borough Park Brooklyn. herd immunity now. 60% positive serology tests counting people already tested positive hospitals PCR tests. serology now, 5% positivity zipcodes borough park 8% one point within last two weeks.

I'm terrified tomorrow's numbers be. ""I feel fine, problem. Everybody going get matter get me""

Such easy dismissal guilt, shame so, necessary cornerstone lives irresponsible selfish.

Our ""Western"" Society is, disturbingly increasingly, riddled people, top bottom, whimsically making decisions without care concern others, based solely suits them, right now, moreover, complying others negatively impacted form.

This behaviour naughty children, supposed adults.

This behaviour reflected by, simplest examples, folk seldom using indicators/trafficators...they literally lift finger help, least seek avoid contributing problem. 

There hope so-called Herd Immunity, lockdown's demonstrably way reduce R-number, even remove day-to-day hazard areas large nations. Again, demonstrably, article points out.

Whether (even partly) successful vaccines help us later, R-number sufficiently low allow ""opening up"" societies, unless wretches described *obliged* comply, masks, distancing, stay-home orders necessary, never eradicate Covid, *evidenced* fragile economies populations continue suffer, best. ACKTUALLY worst-case scenario would inflicted worst possible misery everyone. Wait, that's possible? ;-) one winter last year really bad. got used head mod sub, advanced grad degrees. I've worked infectious disease bioterrorism defense years. roommate best friend believe conspiracy. believe trust even me. really know convince people true. That’s nice positive spin.

Hmmm... let’s add 2020 IRS taxes list.

Oh... local library. book literally 1993 returned - afraid to. reminded article posted recently virus really accumulate poorly ventilated rooms, making dangerous even people masks (maybe less N95 goggles). situation feels risky terms airborne transmission. even going go details Japanese Japan one tiny country east Asia.

Seriously, anybody believes shit complete fucking moron. never watched much city council meeting? Imagine five six people viciously arguing two three hours restaurant sign five feet tall five feet six inches tall...and think meetings **entire nations** capable coming worldwide depopulation/genocide plan actually agreeing go it? I'd say lockdown India literal lockdown too. kid once? think 16 year old get vasectomy even practice safe sex perfectly.

Currently still have:

* 25k travel limit (ending week)
* Melbourne metro go regional Victoria, less restrictions (ending week)
* 10 person outdoor gatherings
* 1 household visit per day home.
* Restaurants / pubs open, strict capacity limits, sit down.
* Mandatory masks public. H1N1 influenza extinct wild 20 years re-emerged back wild 1977. replaced H2N2. first observed Northern China re-emerging; could circulating year discovered (if circulated longer would shown genetic drift). likely lab accident caused re-emergence, outbreak would expected close accident; China. virus spread rapidly among people younger early 20's similar strain influenza before, raised suspicions similar older strain, later confirmed. forgot:

*However, inconsistent use associated decreased risk (adjusted OR, 0.87 [CI, 0.41 1.84]). Mask type (medical mask only, nonmedical mask only, both) independently associated risk SARS-CoV-2 infection (P = 0.54). Methodological limitations included potential recall bias. addition, data missing potential discrepancies control exposures limited. Therefore, strength evidence mask use risk SARS-CoV-2 community settings remained insufficient*

So either can't read dishonest. seem literate. Especially it’s kids already huge disadvantage risk falling behind.

Upper middle class/rich kids go private school tutors. [I think MEATY. CLAWS. 

Haha love username.  lol honestly think nothing truly horrible happened Americans since depression. Europe, Asia, south America, guys experienced real bad shit. war cities bombed, Holocaust happened, people starved China, south america political instability, war poverty. US pretty much good 1950+. we're asked sacrifice CANNOT BELIEVE bad things would ever happen large scale. abstract us cannot understand it, like dividing zero. honestly deep feel like life FAIR (lol) good, GOD protect us, like ""always"" has.

Because always has. recent memory anyway. People suffered depression mostly dead now. make fun cheap hiding money floorboards hoarding food. would worn masks. would complied orders. know bad shit happen them. saw parents siblings die disease, childbirth. knew invincible. Statute limitations applies 

Most libraries stop late fees 70 days impression endless pandemic kills millions people halts forward motion lives years *less* mental/social/developmental health hazard year online school?

USA ... USA .
But seriously, shame knew going get worse yet leaders state national level letting happen. Everyone take care family. shortages though, mass panic probably anti mask people. need stock anything, reason all.

Ofcourse stores run people buying 30 packs toilet paper ass holes buying stock try sell profit. USA equivalent case volume population ratio Italy would ~170,000 cases. get I’m sure. Perhaps next couple weeks. contradiction though. 1. actually know well doing. 2. US countries can't lock people houses kill obey. also cameras everywhere even able enforce it. 3. still regional outbreaks everytime one pops allowed leave house area. work here.

China lot things right. That's correct, violate many human rights way accomplishments. like cheating test claiming smart got good grade. kids someone take care old sick.

Next time meet parents, please give long hug say ""Thank you. never understand make worth."" immunosuppressed get vaccine. Shortly return normal life confidence risk severe illness zero, extremely low. thing influenza get flu shot every year. everyone else thing enough? Wouldn’t negative result mean vaccine actually working? Wrong. know. saw Bangalore, almost 90% people wearing masks today. Almost every one wore masks today. Maybe places went, sure crowded places like markets Majestic (city bus stand). don’t ask check vitamin don’t least ones different doctors. Definitely did. Anytime moderate crisis occurs, news going turn major crisis get eyeballs glued screen. turned TV, pandemic largely disappeared someone going life. That's different time. time, there's real impact daily life people can't escape even wanted unless go full neet. Get ready Indiana, you’re next. like morons biglyest morons. Winning! None. 

So isn’t happening. Thanks clearing up. risk asshole, must warn looking hopeful movie, it. Keep schools open though...good job fuckers. Mmm hypocrisy tastes good. Maybe course many years take place. lot young couples choosing children it’s can’t afford raise kids due wage inequality.

(hopefully jynxing rise cases) Yup. Sheep. 4% US technically Stores restrict buying.

I personally dislike people nearly year prepare, nothing. gradual stockpiling allows shortages found addressed. there's enough go around, everyone fine. isn't, known months ago. we'll find now.

Panic buying boarding helpful. preparing nothing also helpful. second group first group bad other.

Or. federal government dosnt enforce state law yet alone law city. Bro, ny ground zero. could states fuck bad ny? literally themselves. Ny slowly ticking hope get bad like rest country right now. Texas finally mandating masks cdc told everyone months. Republican states give fuck man. probably won’t many people sick

What? even seeking news still bombarded headlines saying ""Single-day Covid record broken... today"".

I surprised numbers explode even coming weeks. Thats point. Even years plan eruption, 400+ million people go? There's conceivable way evacuate many people. We're talking US minimum effected, half Canada Central America too.  USA, USA, USA! radiologist head pandemic. 

Oh. Wait. bit propaganda? China uses huge amount part mostly true. Every single infected person die! We're doomed! Wear masks, eat bugs! We're together! Every 100k cases another 600 dead. spring USA lose full 9/11 citizens every day. Even totally crashes healthcare system. think are? 
Stop actin' like kind star 
Just think are? 
Take like man, baby, that's likely reason medical staff knowledgeable treat virus.  5k deaths daily incoming next 2 weeks. suggest? Another nationwide shutdown? one take responsibility themselves? Tell people lost lives Trump self absorbed Statistically, 2500 people die. appears states may reported yet? Jesus. map? wanna see data location. feel this. kids four half first year they've really understood Halloween. desperately want give ""normal"" Halloween, that's safe smart. Mom place nice backyard, tomorrow they'll treat hunt backyard bunch Halloween themed games insanely creative put together. kids got pick costumes everyone, going nice family Halloween remain safe little pod. Hope little one fun safe holiday! Osama bin Laden would loved lived see 2,400 Americans died day nice knowing all! numba 1 think time day stop reporting. I've watching worldometers since early pandemic, that's I've noticed. reset next day 9 9:30pm EDT. CDC stops adding daily case count earlier that. least that's I'd seen earlier on. well, someone home it, isolate person anyway. matter dry hot air circulating living room, infected person sleeping/other room time alone. idea people actually go like ""screw it, i'll get too, you, you"", tho. mean yeah, measurements absolute worst 9th anything brag feel evenly slightly comforted by? 🥳🥳 Close schools &amp; colleges mandatory online lessons, places worship, team sports, nightclubs, bars, cinemas. 
Keep open - masks get closed 6 months - malls, restaurants, workplaces, medical places. Deaths lag new cases much 8 weeks. Well, incentive public knows full scale impact helps understand fucking serious. Anything less negligence. states well don’t play numbers. take people truly stopped giving shit point people apathetic many people actually really stop it. though rounding corner....? What's crazy think know anyone gotten covid. know anyone knows anyone gotten covid. makes said even worse, americans argue sniffing propaganda self interest, non american cant even use excuse  probably start 3 They're taking play Nazi handbook:

[If tell lie big enough keep repeating it, people eventually come believe Joseph Goebbels Eat canned sardines. joking. Loaded vit d. Tell others secret. you? 

I walked CVS got flu shot back 10 minutes. 

You’re also saying that’s every single American gets vaccines, isn’t going happen due anti vaxxers apathy, reasons. 

It’s like they’re going stop producing vaccines either long gives immunity defense 6-12 months they’ll able keep producing more. Oh god oh fuck may .01% chance fatality. Eat canned sardines. joking. Tell others secret. We're number one! We're number one! We're number one! good sources ""real news""? I'm sure could, we'll probably include activities ideas kinds redditors suggested. **Reported** We're \#1!

Ah fuck need drink. Wtf america goddammit incident 2 FBI agents killed issued revolvers (at time) way outgunned Guinness World Record at? like like reopenings totally going result surge beginning June.

In LA county, least, latest spike cases coincides exactly easing restrictions. keep re-opening soon. literally killing us. might many do. Lol where. delusional statement. Israel twice full lockdowns always work. harsh cost lot else u gonna do? 70% 340 million population x 0.7% DEFEATED! think live second nightmare Kudos China. can’t even get people wear masks USA. guess it’s little different u get thrown jail following quarantine.  reschedule meteor Feb 14? wanna die knowing took many bastards us Put stuffed animals behind door ones give candy =) absolutely need another shutdown unfortunately it’s way politicized point won’t happen. Good luck everybody lungs fucked COVID can’t smoke anymore 😕 might going crazy seems like Arizona Texas death numbers gradually going down. 

I following closely beginning know last time checked Arizona (because unfortunately, live here) deaths around 1200 couple months ago. way hell Texas lower. kinds fuckery going on. Rethugs think numbers padded, I'm saying quite opposite. Disappearing zeroes maybe. I'm stuck work I'll miss halloween year, wife parents costume party kids, they're also going hide candy around house, scary version Easter egg hunt. Better nothing.  tell uneducated poor people trickle economics save way knowing you’re wrong. Imagine moment Trump would talk COVID could blame Obama. Imagine news cycle would look like. Yeah, wrong damn corner. scary part Yellowstone wide spread potential damage is. evacuate continent huge rain toxic ash due 2 weeks? least earthquakes fairly localized, even destructive. Learn swimmmmm wait 2 weeks maskless Halloween parties. really worries me. live urban (ish) Midwest, several hospitals town, filling maskless wonders rural areas, local hospitals.

Our region's positivity rate 8% week, told we'd going mitigation restrictions. mayor said, nope, we're not. He's even Democrat. Ugh, tourist town! Same. taking precautions, working home minimizing trips public. I'm neighborhood saw 300+ kids last year. wish would stay hell home doubtful. proactive, wife stuffing candy bags set curbside table I'll caution tape yard keep people coming house. Christian Pulisic lol many times read similar headline week?  200,000 deaths USA reality denying like yours, think that's win. uses built first place? 7% still much lower positivity rate Mexico Czech Republic. positivity rate Czech republic 5 times USA rate. Okay understand point trying make informed facts spouting dangerous beliefs like that, putting others risk. 

So real science intake oxygen discharge carbon dioxide, wear MASK one oxygen molecules escapes mask interface HOWEVER one oxygen molecule along carbon molecule remains, CO, carbon monoxide. mask converts air breathe creates deadly collection carbon monoxide kill prolonged use. worst part euphoria oxygen deprivation feel CO reminiscent ""europhia"" radical left feels moral high ground blindly listening cult science community. 

Covid cannot dangerous definition saved lord's grace radical leftist communists. worship Satan get amen?  Yeah, could imagine many cases would've today Trump administration successfully defeated virus!? Also: fault mine. US good destabilizing US 3% morality rate (approx), translated around 3,000 deaths per day...

But also picked random European country (Germany case) they’re seeing massive spike well. Approximately case rate % population. may time fully trash US numbers. may new reality. We're trick-or-treat treasure hunt place year resident 4 year old. wrapped bunch little candy/toy bags look like little pumpkins, spiders, ghosts cauldrons, going set around house little clue tags attached one, help figure next one is. We're planning ending night turning lights off, playing halloween music, using glow sticks dance around dark. Same! I’m Texas two homes street (that know of)currently every family member infected. People neighborhood FB page talking trick treating. It’s insane. state top new cases gov absolutely nothing. Less nothing! yeah let’s live best lives go beg Covid candy. Maybe fact already addressed paragraph person replying to? Wild guess. Seriously. dumb fuck uncle everybody knows going go annoyance major liability thanksgiving. Reality denying attitude Trump lead, currently following, USA middle mass-death event. 

You need stop think individual people dying, want someone maintains deaths matter. sort person would value system. Who’s using cages? Wow forget. Even 1st grade figure one bet voting contributing Trump cast shadow absentee ballots. voted person assume ballot would counted way corruption going on. wild virus catastrophic deadly we're simply told ""tough out""

lol least peasants got $1,200 elite got billions I’m well aware many don’t thy option I’m thankful do. I’m saying I’m mad people things need do. I’m pissed neighbors throwing parties almost weekly basis since March. I’m mad dad, married nurse treating COVID patients, isn’t distancing traveling going restaurants like normal. I’m mad drive grocery store curbside pickup pass restaurant patios absolutely packed people, go store see groups adults several kids running around, unmasked, couching touching literally everything running right people’s faces. understand places it’s bad right Phoenix hotspot it’s spiking back kind stuff. 100k! 100k! 100k! don’t know better example “frog boiling water” metaphor lifetime. apathy really broken soul. 

How country become numb this. Donny jr. go TV call 950 deaths yesterday “basically nothing.” country give little value pain suffering neighbors. call cloth face affront civil rights. refuse slight inconvenience knowing hundreds thousands died, without family. nurse they’re lucky. 

It’s painful see selfishness lack empathy blatant almost gleefully expressed. didn’t know many family, friends, neighbors like this. fair, judging personal experience, hard believe sort evolution occurred get person are, dumb are. Don’t know downvoted. exactly don’t know Thank you.Trump awful he’s overshadowing narrative. 

A lot powerful people outside government poor job sliding radar Trump acting lightning rod. unprecedented. ICU beds would empty 90% time. Yeah it’s looking good, numbers going keep rising rising. Obviously hospitals getting overwhelmed condition caring. require one dies gets sick. might disconnected think hospitals far exceeding capacity won’t make people scared party 62 rewards? Who’s giving rewards this? saying deaths dropping rapidly anything death rate lowest point ever 

This brain r/conspiracy and/or r/conservative peer-reviewed?

If interesting. Studies havent peer-reviewed ignored are, unless personally scientist field involved. too, actually important results.  can’t find information protestors don’t sign anything! least rallies know going happens after. protestors town go anyway I’m sure large number associated way knowing “Stay used years decades”

Uh buddy, don’t know winter people done this. 👊 Good job guys!!  still know single person sick year doomerz want lockdowns masks generations, evolve weakened immune system ^(/s) type question reddit comment could typed Google?

Surely one trying simply make people doubt study playing ""I'm asking questions"" game prevalent right wing media. Surely not... Sorry one irks me; mandated  think election comes goes see process going forward. 

People tolerate risks every day significantly worse covid 19 infection, you’re right. think many saw pandemic opportunity exploit political gain, main focus “what’s best us”. 

One side wants exploit guilt people possibly infecting others fear infection control people, side wants exploit people’s fear governmental control anger reductions freedom. Neither side reason truthfully speak subject, they’re middle power grab. 

I fully support able live life risk death, it’s life, fucking property corporation work people vote for. hope remember judge everyone else negatively terrified, people didn’t chance told designed make afraid. 

That said, don’t think it’s right go halfway. real leader country (assuming you’re USA) first foremost list priorities, might best us stock supplies period, assist need assistance housing, go complete lockdown predetermined amount time, based pathology virus scientific consensus long would take die without possibility new host. It’d unprecedented extreme lot people would it. effective, president would go history best leaders, would survived TOGETHER instead splitting middle like idiots. 

It’s really, really long time since we’ve even seen candidate cares American people cares money power. people still going Halloween parties allow children trick treat. country absolutely doomed sheer stupidity.  Nuanced opinion? Murderer! 3 cheers them, amirite? depopulation plan mother nature. it, chased virus, going away. /s UK almost 1.5K deaths per day height, R number reduced 1.0 could indeed happen. Exponential growth that. CDC needs find often happens said that? 9/11 Obama needed him. Got em. going beach fine...? talking beach day trip beach vacation airplanes, hotels, restaurants? confusing talking high risk activities like indoor athletics seeing elderly people without quarantining low risk activities like going beach comment. think look? went dozens protests. Outside, masks on, cognizant virus. Studies show inside circulating air masks highest risk. Studies done huge protests, way bigger rallies, show little spike cases. Personally, believe peer reviewed scientific studies. guitar riff China country comparable US population size density. Smaller countries/island countries substantial advantage contain virus.  interesting - important feature outbreak 24 attendees documented evidence antibodies SARS-CoV-2 arrival. None persons received positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test result retreat. 

Out 150 students around USA ... 1 6 already Covid.

Am interpreting right? many people die given day? Sure, there's varied views there, elements truth I'm sure. change cities forever, anything requiring work home many bound to.

Note opening paragraphs also might back semblance normality summer time next year,"" says Prof Julian Hiscox, University Liverpool. ""But 'back 2019' five years,"" predicts.

Which sounds fair enough me. Vaccines take long time distribute all, even one still going affecting people's lives degree.

That seems largest point contention - literal degrees someone takes ""back to"". saying ""approximately"" big handwave, whereas others saying ""it still impacting things way"". two statements far apart may seem you, fit within handwave. Doesn’t Plague Inc. usually take place span several in-game years? tip iceberg. Serious question: studies quality protests / riots? Well unless show evidence protests lead significant infection spread assume didn’t

If people outdoors, packed together close people stadium rally, wearing masks, summer infection rates lower could see much infection resulted them. step mom residing them, supposed shorter this, would could... trying find place move everything seems raised prices... type people showing rallies clearly taking covid seriously rest daily lives, thus likely bring virus rallies spread it. Even protest circumstances spreading exactly (they aren't) seems likely attendees masked half brain less likely contracted covid elsewhere brought protests. Damn homie, bet like dress white robes stand around circles friends too. don’t put hands steering wheel. Shit, forget speeding, government says gotta wear belt drive??? country know done actual **lockdown** China, everywhere else it’s “lockdown” people literally locked houses 

(What I’m trying say distinction isn’t relevant West nobody willing embrace “lock” part “lockdown”)  Again, wasn’t discussing overall picture, article hand. Since comment deleted, much didn’t come through. it’s okay, bring downvotes. four people agree fifth complete idiot. Agreed. Biden wins, every fucking day next year hear Trump whining Twitter Biden ""isn't enough"" stop would done better (though clearly know that's case.) /s ?  guy tell month ago almost over.  informed him, ""thats viruses work"" responded confidence buffoon. ""You wait"" Well, I'm still waiting. Frostburg State University, Western MD. bad. Good luck guys, hope things get better--Today Slovakia reported 2573 cases, 154,000 US equivalent Hi Ian It’s almost like protesters masked before, during, protests, mattered. China Asian country control. 1 5 think hoax 1 5 believe conspiracy means 40% US believe BS related Covid... protest pictures I’ve seen people wearing masks kind. Now. 20 years ago got year probation DFW marijuana two ounces What? literally never heard anyone say depopulation plan.. never mind 1 5? must taken poll Comicon something. W H B U ?"
