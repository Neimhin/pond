There's also selection bias here. someone thinks exposed Covid, mild symptoms, who's gonna get tested: vaccinated person who's taking seriously along, staunch anti-vaxxer thinks Bill Gates wants microchip him? 

In equivalent situations, person go get test count towards ""vaccinated positive"" whereas person B never get tested contribute equivalent unvaccinated case count. big question still suffer permanent damage asymptomatic? imagine unlikely, really want take sort risk. incredibly dumb‚Ä¶ Info believe research shows 1 st dose Pfizer , 3 weeks you‚Äôre 92-94%, second dose needed. study done 2 weeks‚Ä¶inconclusive. referring original covid, delta. can‚Äôt help wonder second shot really needed delta either.

Heartbreaking. Ive wait 8 weeks bc? diseases didn‚Äôt suddenly disappear, patients did. Many delayed seeking care last year covid, especially winter it‚Äôs worst here. 

However, governor pointed beds found patients, staff available care another issue. also know 40% Arkansas healthcare workers UNvaccinated.

Yay! 8 weeks bc Canada thinking analogy vs first principles kind thing.But, yes, general first principles better, vast majority trained think way educated enough apply it.Thus would better get informed exactly vaccines work, read studies, read criticisms etc. form opinion know probably true.

In reality, can't expect people. next best thing thinking analogy, yeah rich smart probably good indicator doing, instead listening randoms youtube facebook equally uninformed peers.

That's big big big, huge, enormous social media problem have... Israel 83% effective though? definitely financially sound decision either. insurance going pay it, themselves, possibly government/hospital system insurance. still meaningless.

There's three numbers track fully immunized:

1) Odds catching all.

2) Odds infection bad enough hospitalize you.

3) Odds infection bad enough kill you.

Something like ""88% effective"" tell jack shit. affected I'd completely agree. Unfortunately risks effectiveness drop-offs, breakthrough cases, new variants spawning unvaxxed pools people mean problem whole population deal with. anyone know whether second vaccine adds 26% (approx) per week, ie linear fashion, levels get boost 12-14 days? curious. agree pay scales shit. I‚Äôm corporately owned control pay scales. say started becoming competitive pay due pandemic. 

On vaccine point.. find hard see force someone take vaccine lose job. would civil rights issue perfect setup lawsuit He‚Äôll Tucker Carlson, guaranteed. ""99% new cases unvaccinated"" ""88% efficacy Delta"" necessarily logically inconsistent statements.

1. Delta 100% cases.
2. People unvaccinated much likely mask engage risky behavior.
3. importantly, even vaccine 88% effective preventing Delta, vaccines clustered specific regions, regions better 88% reduction cases, way spread unvaccinated areas. common amongst group friends well

apparently everybody thinks soon get vaccinated, party around unmasked

so much disinformation there, especially reddit fumbling again, live household someone can't get vaccine, also masking up. Yes, nearly identical

Source: understand that. business would call police indicate person trespassing refusing leave. Police would enforcing mask mandate. would enforcing trespassing. Might late Americans bc misinformation many needlessly died 2 stood nothing lie &amp; liars care now. Guess what? doctor know safe vaccines kids. Nobody does. That's results clinical trials still pending.

Yes, there's small chance kid dying severe complications covid. low-risk (not risk-free) thing leave unvaccinated now. There's small chance kid could severe complications die vaccine. low-risk (not risk free) thing give kind unauthorized vaccine. risk lower? Nobody knows trials completed results analyzed.  sad we're back (wearing masks). mom situation would stress wish family good health.   Exactly. live Australia we've lot success suppressing covid lockdowns masks. vaccination effort severely lacking due shortage mRNA vaccines, paranoia tiny risks AZ vaccine. Lockdowns worked really well applaud people right thing stopping becoming endemic here, but, options want go forever. Oooh reminds old sub wore mask bottom lip level, chewed student ‚Äòdisrespectful‚Äô asked pull mask. (She clearly distressed likely germaphobe family lost virus)

Edit: bottom lip  want change minds. answer first 2. 

Most (not all) get sick.

Yes, you‚Äôre still shedding yes, still pass others. data yet long vaccines effective for? got vaccinated January worry much longer I'll protected. lungs suck, frankly, least don‚Äôt require anti-rejection drugs daily. worry long haul symptoms. great hospitalized, course. However future repercussions equally important. glad friends recovered! None remotely within control CDC federal government general.

The federal government can't really much here. lead proverbial horses water, point state governments determine do.

I think CDC smart start this. Democratically run states higher vaccine uptake alright. Republican states anti-mask governor's people dying. 

If CDC mandate masks would really taken seriously places need done. rest country cut nose spite liberals. elementary aged children. wear masks thousand times better adults never complain. It‚Äôs grown ups problem  test delta variant? first shot J&amp;J, get Pfizer shot, need second Pfizer shot? husband's job requires occasionally person face face conversations clients. employer requires employees work directly clients vaccinated wear masks in-person meetings them. clients wear masks, low vaccine area. Which, Delta variant huge deal now, chronic illness, we're greater risk serious symptoms breakthrough infections. bet he's using N95 respirators instead fabric masks now. yeah, find authentic N95 KN95 masks reasonable prices. Well that's fair high-schoolers. Kinda. Swiss cheese model way conceptualize various layers defenses work together mitigate risk. still subjective question much risk acceptable.    problem. 

Los Angles really wonky place everyone getting back degree normal Delta showed up. profit health insurance find way deny coverage long get away awhile. 

As much I'm frustrated people getting vaccinated, giving insurance companies mechanism boosting profits denying coverage really, really terrible idea.  Sue business. ""Some health departments may continue report vaccine breakthrough cases national database continue submit specimens CDC sequencing. However, CDC focus monitoring reported hospitalized fatal cases."" direct accurate response claim COVID leading cause death US, isn't. thanks vaccination.. got mine today too...my next one August 12th Serious question: 

Do unvaccinated people create environment virus ""evolves"" mutates towards variants contagious lead serious illness amongst younger people? 

As in, elderly people vaccinated virus runs real estate amongst age group, variants detrimental younger people (than original virus last year) thrive, re-produce, therefore ""evolve"" dangerous variant younger people? 

Apologies word salad... Thank you! got say discussion vaccinations wirh friend Facebook.  Non vaccine mask. left bc risking people younger. said aunt nurse Atlanta going since started.  iy fair work extra shifts yo help you. said well get vaccinated.  said would syop yhr conversation. believe choice ugh.  That's better 30% folks company got - laid off. satisfying Joffrey getting slapped. probably said publicly; bet medical insurance provider would happy raise premiums drop outright sucks terms concerns Delta next weeks, rest assured *extremely* effective waiting twelve weeks instead three.  Still good enough concerts go!!! don‚Äôt feel comfortable lying shot already

The COVID symptoms you‚Äôre risking orders magnitude worse mild discomfort saying you‚Äôre vaccinated. Even living uncertainty worse.

Just go get shot mRNA done it. It‚Äôs like you‚Äôre anything illegal unethical (assuming you‚Äôre US surplus, wouldn‚Äôt even preventing someone else receiving vaccine).  much unpack , would sorry life choices ? nothing them.What political stance even life choices? , people across political spectrum made great terrible decisions key question reddit school like supposed be? going third shot first two? Moderna working updated booster, sure Pfizer actually committed making something different. think looked said ""yeah fine, may need third shot later booster"". care happens them. sh!tbags didn‚Äôt care last year spreading virus killing people. 

They absolutely rot! Wait sees medical bills. Maybe hold trip bit. ü§™ think different restrictions vaccination status could also factor here.. apply people covid got 1 shot? told need 2nd one. Wow. 2 weeks hour me. Didn‚Äôt 15% people serious illness vaccines? 91% isn‚Äôt good. Bacteria... Poetic. first, durable life planet, evolved. end existence.

The circle life. done die tho? Recent study Texas also showed 9000 people died COVID February July Unvaccinated 43 people. makes possibility survival pretty high like 99.x percent. pretty good? bet rarely even test kids. daughter (10) slight fever super snotty nose causing coughing due drainage. worried might COVID knew delta causes nasal symptoms, made appointment tested three days illness. took pediatrician's NP said probably RSV going around get over-the-counter medicine. want test unless developed symptoms got worse. 

Luckily, got better soon that, testing kids (who tend less affected) *some* symptoms, many cases miss?   Quebec strain delta taken hold here. like 200 delta cases, compared nearly 4000 Ontario right next door. pure dumb luck coupled excellent vaccine coverage. 8 million people even hitting 100 cases per day. Hospitalizations low too. Yep. one point seemed like southern third world countries suffering poor, winter illness. We'll really see effective vaccines December. little data common long covid syndrome is. know people still problems even mild asymptomatic covid. know yet common is, well vaccine prevents (presumably does, much unclear). True, pandemic ones still hesitating really know better now. agree, anti vaxxers another breed üòÅ percentage preventing infection? read something studies Israel resulted around 60% preventing infection I'm sure results similar countries. That's viruses work. Mutation based selective pressure something predictable. unfortunate‚Ä¶hope distribute vaccines quickly prevent larger spread. lot decent answers recent trials 2021 break 95% (what use be, 88% Delta strain) actually means. 
 
Pre-Delta.. got fully vaccinated two shots encounter virus contagious setting, 9/10 times would basically bounce right you. great means transmission reduced. 
 
But exposed 10 times, likely contract eventually. 
 
Furthermore vaccine reduces severity disease manage contract 1/10 time. ~half. originally 10% chance hospitalized it, would 5% chance. 
  [This showed COVID-19 cases vaccinated single dose either Pfizer-BioNTech AstraZeneca vaccines similar levels protection mortality single dose, 44% 55% respectively, compared unvaccinated 
 [..The data shows protection mortality Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine even higher ‚Äì around 69% ‚Äì confirmed cases second dose least 7 days prior positive 
 
^(these numbers bit lower Delta strain) 
 
That's still nasty virus want get -50% severity definitely nice. 
 
----- 
 
The point vaccinated mean immune. almost equivalent walking around N95 mask face. That's helpful, sit around contagious room long enough still contract it. spread (at reduced rate unvaccinated person), still hurt even die it. 
 
So cases really growing area, still think good idea even vaccinated people wear masks keep distance. light safety measures like **plus** vaccine does, really pretty good. much TV news. article name single official researcher, doesnt link single source study. 
Who specifically making claims?
Were raw research data?
Who funded research?

If used article source information reddit discussion, people wouldnt tearing new one would fraught confirmation bias. true strength COVID undermines society's immune response. wouldnt want weaken trust j&amp;j work?  sorry hear positive. hope get better. way explain efficacy general sense, think right.

However, particular scenario described, airborne virus given enough time, 100% vaccinated unvaccinated going accumulate enough viral doses become infected. vaccinated ones take longer become infected better outcomes. lie sign Pfizer regime  comment automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Ate like shit. still think everyone deserves access healthcare.   may come surprise many vaccinated Americans, often assume completely shielded virus.

The real surprise *so many people* assumed this. recall nearly day 1 vaccine availability, message crystal clear would \*not\* prevent infections 100%. fact many people misled bit crazy IMO, suppose par course pandemic misinformation... That‚Äôs far risky flu. Stats flu (a per CDC website) range 37 - 199 deaths season. Covid surpassed that. Also consider resources Brazil. Folks favela getting greatest care even many Brazilian hospitals likely level quality US. I‚Äôve seen plenty Israeli researchers propose idea - I‚Äôve also seen lot Israeli scientists baffled MOH would release kinds statements without releasing methodology used get there.

If links data maybe I‚Äôm missing would love see I‚Äôm scratching head trying understand got numbers l.  take advice anybody right! Nah also prevent infection too. Obviously it‚Äôs bulletproof.  lmao  Holy shit  quite Israeli researchers posting analysis reasoning English.

The main difference countries seems Israelis got vaccinated January British got vaccinated late spring. current theory initial antibody response drops, longer term immunity memory works delta replicates fast overwhelm becomes effective, therefore breakthrough infections. see huge effectiveness differences based someone got vaccinated work office full engineers. apply patterns solve problems. average stance is: masks reduce spread, staying away people too, vaccines work, still want come back office. Umm, wearing mask treating everyone like biological weapon effect mental health too. hopes dreams Maybe - still seems highly unlikely vaccine efficacy dropped 16% six months(per today‚Äôs MOH update). true we‚Äôd seeing similar rates infection healthcare workers/over 65 unvaccinated. hasn‚Äôt seemed case all.

I‚Äôm wrong I‚Äôm seeing add up. 

Take consideration look Israel‚Äôs covid cases - going considering delta R0 around 6 seeing much larger case numbers/exponential growth Israel given laxed distancing measures. Clearly vaccines blunting rise cases. 

Compare Los Angeles county almost identical case loads Israel one month ago 2500 cases day Israel‚Äôs 1200. 

Obviously two places aren‚Äôt sound comparisons definitely paints picture what‚Äôs impact vaccines having.

I would bet whole lot Israel‚Äôs data off. lack complete data weeks people asking seems bizarre.   Lower viral load man.  One month Viro I'm getting 2nd shot 5 days. read people delta variant 1,000 times virus nasal passages infected original strain. There‚Äôs still debate shedding; studies found asymptomatic vaccinated people don‚Äôt seem spread virus much asymptomatic non-vaccinated people do.

For symptomatic cases though, seems same.

It‚Äôs still better assume spread others regardless, everyone‚Äôs safety. data change, new variant occur.

Regardless, everyone vaccinated spread would major issue. Even virus continues spread, vaccinated would keep hospitals overwhelmed. aware. ""Mild"", medical doctors, means stay hospital. might still hellish misery home week. hospital still rough week.

Also - know Long Covid. Many people mild cases Covid got Long Covid comfort think may get end hospital. 

Also also - 87 year old mom survive even mild covid based health issues, trust me. want fly run risk giving her.

Am freaking out? Yes! There's lot freak about. start wave, totally preventable. 

People think over, getting bad again. hand, Brazil reports 1000 deaths children age 10 course epidemic. 

That‚Äôs likely Lambda, Delta. Lambda reached US. Hopefully won‚Äôt cross-pollinate Delta. Lmao slippery slope? Big pharma may given us vaccines also gave us opioid epidemic. insurance companies could set precedent able manipulate rates coerce people taking meds, can't hard imagine could easily go wrong walk Target, Walgreens etc. ask shot. It‚Äôs like ask driver‚Äôs license check whether already got vaccine, couldn‚Äôt even. Q folks NextDoor saying fucking dumb shit vaccination covid, I'm kind okay demographic never gets vaccinated shaves percentage point numbers throughout various counties. state belong anymore, time fucking done one way another. effective Moderna, comparison? got second shot month ago, left house times since then. Feeling mild weirdly inconsistent cold symptoms right paranoid got hit Delta.

I‚Äôm unemployed introvert living home, I‚Äôve really good keeping harm‚Äôs way whole time. opinion either way argument, want point kids home school right now, June 2021 would best indication. don‚Äôt.

Currently sitting ER covid shortness breath. data sourced? reports say it‚Äôs 69% since variant naturally evolve farther farther away base variant becomes new one.

Let‚Äôs say 2 groups 1,000 people (2,000 total). One group fully vaccinated group not.

You wait till 100 people 2,000 catch COVID (delta variant). 12 people would‚Äôve fully vaccinated group 88 people non-vaccinated group. ok accepting medical help he's infected? pumped full drugs fluids drips stuff. preferable vaccine? imagine we'd seen people getting COVID 2 dose regimen reporting worse symptoms 2nd dose. know one person happened to, 2nd dose better first. heard US, UK/Canada doses delayed.

I'm sure less-misleading number, whatever is, still quite compelling. think two positions co-exist. say don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs government‚Äôs place require vaccines time would recommend make decision get it. Yep we're... especially idiots keep getting lucky live. Lucky us, guy antibodies awhile.  even talk numbers increasing.... Get 2nd now. give fresh/good protection w/in 2weeks. time 8 weeks arrive CDC may OKed least begun talking 3rd/booster shot. No. can't right. Reddit told British idiots following corporate validated dosing regime. Can't right. Whiskey Tango Foxtrot?  equation ""I chose hospital"", even consider put healthcare workers position, feels entitled care perfectly fine it. would embarrassed apologize them. Herd immunity also protects vaccinated. Right vaccinated people getting breakthrough infections, may drive variants even resistant existing vaccines. 85% whatever level needed herd immunity, existing variants would find hard circulate breakthrough infections would drop near zero. Can‚Äôt vote six feet possible extrapolate J&amp;J similar AstraZeneca? bad people, opinion. one thing duped covid misinformation, another thing actively spread it, many anti-vaxxers done. even conservative grifters profiting delusion, rather bunch average people becoming obsessed anti-vaxx conspiracies sharing everywhere (on social media, family gatherings, anti-vaxx rallies, etc). Part stupidity, there's also something malicious there, especially take extra step persistently mislead others.   We‚Äôre gonna need bigger alphabet others pointed out, get herd immunity, need enough population get vaccinated achieve that, higher transmissibility (r0), bigger proportion that's needed get there, unfortunately, \~1/3rd US idiots, that's happening. They're classic case ""why can't nice things"" (herd immunity).

However, also keep mind, yes, vaccinated people *are* getting symptomatic COVID (a lot less often unvaccinated), important stats we're seeing terms vaccine efficacy [99% COVID deaths among That's important part.

I talked doctor today said yes, he's patient two who's vaccinated, that's gotten actual symptoms, one actually plenty health issues vaccine would put group high risk severe infection death, instead lost sense smell day felt like mild cold. I'd love get symptomatic COVID all, I'll take mild cold could've horrific death. chance. known would work. Everyone supported strategy provided amount people short term protection better long term protection. legislation push people get vaccinated 

I may wrong, didn‚Äôt DeSantis sign law legislation Florida exact opposite? Like makes illegal require vaccine? I‚Äôm Florida, I‚Äôm 100% that, correct, seems currently saying isn‚Äôt supported actions. prevents infection spread 91%
So, perfect. absolutely inaccurate suggest offer protection Parts Africa 1% population vaccinated.

Were definitely going get variants worth remembering drop antibodies necessarily make vaccine significantly less effective. still cells B cells. bodies keep producing massive amounts antibodies every disease ever come contact with, keep memory produce antibodies produce need (I surely way simplifying yea). massive drop antibodies necessarily sign anything all. 


I'd expect boosters abundance caution though countries would probably rather ""waste"" money vaccines risk hit hard another wave this. I'd gladly take booster shot fall peace mind nothing else Well would look that. Darwinism/natural selection job. average IQ American people slowly going change. Can‚Äôt fix stupid live NC unvaccinated neighbor scheduled vaccine appointment cases going back up. Hopefully people see numbers same.  got second back April, need booster? Perhaps appropriate solution health insurance pay sabotaged health? amazing, I'm sorry people insist idiots. Sounds like companies planning bring employees back office Labor Day rethink things. unvaccinated immune compromised individual family, may want know spreading virus not. Yup without location would non-starter. feasible modern world w/o remote notable nations. mean? $17/hr generous. Let's start $7.25 see 6 months we'll give $0.10 raise.  Vax+N95. Downside risk: unnecessary mild inconvenience. Rather cheap considering alternative. Sweden pretty good statistic, hurrying push out. Looking numbers things one need know context:

1. Last summer also pretty big dip death/infection statistics, even Europe actually starting second wave already. People commented due good weather encouraging people go outside outdoors, people leaving big cities go summer vacation spots also people able keep better distance conditions.
2. Sweden really well vaccination rates groups high risk complications death all-adults-age groups. 87+% adults 60 years old fully vaccinated, 4.5% group received first dose vaccination. many regions vaccination schedule available 18+ years olds age group already 43% received least one vaccination. today's reporting, 75.8 % adults Sweden received least 1 dose, 48.1% adults fully vaccinated already.
3. summer reporting much larger lag usually. extremely likely deaths occurring right (in low numbers, still some) added retroactively reporting catches everyone's summer holiday deaths daily.
4. However, even lag reporting, numbers get reported encouraging. good twitter account keeps extensive database reports since start -   88% time, works every time. Bold strategy cotton. Unfortunately even data yet 12s.

I say parent anxiously waiting get kiddo vaccinated. Well truly believe COVID hoax vaccines plot control probably feel obligated convince others believe same. spreading ‚Äúmiss information‚Äù doesn‚Äôt necessarily make bad, dumb. think it‚Äôs worse. Bad people usually minority, dumb people result failed education systems Let's forget fundamentalist Christians. lot among players, kirk cousins gave real bs non answer whether he'd get vaccine not. It‚Äôs great, even slightly better two doses Pfizer: one interesting. Two things true once. FDA objectively corrupt, corrupt agency tens thousands employees.

In short, even someone wants move goalpost, behoove FDA corrupt point assume antivaxxer would go lengths rationalize. argument somewhere vicinity ""they killing people."" government wants people alive create private enterprise excuse federal reserve release dollar bills pay government plans use taxation. Anything else antithetical long-term building.

People right might surprised ""lefty"" write this. Free market economics go hand hand ""trust nothing."" Terrifying. Older people robust immune system compared younger people. cases older people seeing many side effects vaccine compared younger people getting wrecked.

Just got second today quite busy centre, close doors make people wait outside properly separated, let another batch 10 persons every minutes. progressed fast though inside (they 10 parallel booths vaccinations). permanently radiate covid.  Early poor people less able access vaccination. still true, walk vaccination widely available? It‚Äôs true nobody ever said vaccines would prevent infections 100%. difference initial roll out, claimed like 90-95% effective preventing symptomatic infection people, that‚Äôs essentially ‚Äúcompletely shielded‚Äù. However, seeing delta definitely much lower effectiveness symptomatic infection, even symptoms often mild. Basically, delta changed game people changed views. wouldn‚Äôt call complete ignorance, it‚Äôs people keeping latest developments. Why? Norway Finland absolutely outliers Europe. Look average Europe, average Scandinavia.

Your argument essentially Sweden *should* outlier, isn't. hilariously stupid. Sounds like actually part 88% then. 88% infection, protection worst symptoms. Congrats, shot worked! already spreading. dominant strain US need look southern states see damage doing.

Unfortunately, governors states care deaths. know makes sense citizens denial living 'different universe' I.

Stay safe, reddit friend. Yeah, we're looking another winter-like spike plausibly modeled scenarios  I'm ex health care worker. I'm sorry people fucking dumb. Please take care yourself. Thank do. IIRC Denmark close following path Sweden. problem reliable estimates number asymptotic cases, result reliable estimates reproduction number infection fatality ratio.
 
It easy make right decissions knowledge hindsight, beginning everybody making decissions dark. scientists sure lockdown could actually succesful western society, sure vaccines would available reached herd immunity infections. (Source: Interviews Lone Simonsen ""Den uafh√¶ngige"") See UK doing. want spike infect non vaccinated people instead alongside cold/flu season. Inside, air stagnant impacted air conditioning systems, covid air would dispurse quickly. Outdoors, large air flow covid air would disperse quickly, making less likely infected even someone currently infectious nearby. risk far less spreading covid outdoors. Stay safe.  So, social racial inequalities playing large role vaccine uptake. Call shocked. btw groups badly hit pandemic. seasonal pattern last summer. Tegnell said would get second wave got second third wave winter spring.

Some reasons:

1. School year ends early june Sweden next school year starts late august. moment schools universitys closed.

2. long dark winters Sweden makes us appreciate summer even people spend little time indoors together people now. summers warm enough need go indoors air conditioned areas.

3. Summer holidays Sweden mostly Juli work activity low now.

My guess see pattern last year second wave started october. time vaccine help keeping death toll down.

When comparing Sweden countries must remember Sweden sparsely populated highest proportion single households world. many generations living together. highly developed country many ability work home (which do). also natural us keep little distance people greet cheek kissing things like that.

So compare Sweden neighbouring countries underdeveloped third world countries. neighbors much better us.  know live somewhere, know area like back hand. move slowly forget details trying remember top head. natural. go visit place gone years remember lot area back definitely gaps knowledge regarding quickest route streets used free parking. looking maps help boost prior knowledge back acceptable levels move around like locals like used even though moved away long ago. 95% effective means 20 people get it, 19 going unvaccinated versus 1 vaccinated.

With delta transmissible, breakthrough infections likely, symptoms shouldn‚Äôt bad.

Do symptoms actually? Well put, especially part keeping seat open. actually expected based way reported. Mostly mrna vaccine unexpectedly good basically perfect protection OG covid. mRNA vaccine flopped? somehow missed delta variant rise right doesn‚Äôt vaccine , starts spreading (which media / who/ cdc saying it‚Äôs spreading quicker original variant) reach new daily highs deaths cases start considering saving lives mass scales Right?! much focus covid, forgot get allergies regular colds. sayin, there‚Äôs something like 98% chance time you‚Äôre 30 you‚Äôve flu you‚Äôre you‚Äôve probably known it. I‚Äôm 32 unaware ever either (although get shot every year religiously).

It‚Äôs actually kind similar covid 30% ‚Äúcases‚Äù fully asymptomatic there‚Äôs massive variation symptoms severity infection infection.

It‚Äôs likely viruses act way never really noticed cared this. something interesting thought I‚Äôd share. compared smallpox higher herd immunity threshold making harder eradicate.

Covid cannot eradicated like Smallpox. Smallpox animals reserves could jump mutate like Covid flu. Covid dance around like flu (huge mutation jumps every year) seems like mammals catch it. starting think head 100% population catching Covid getting vaccinated. likely find place among circulating respiratory diseases point far less serious deadly one immune naive anymore. look see Republicans anti-vax, group, black hispanic people. studies.

With conditions may worst wear mask agree. Even better might change diet physical activity :) risk factors susceptible pretty much anything. non regulated free market health care bill shows maybe  Well, bad lifestyle months years still remotely close getting single shot Probably enough data. best I've seen pop level effects. But, specific. But, 9% general population likely means less vaccinated pop. similar reductions, speculatively cold state overall lower full protection yet them. relevant look happens next month. small rise goes that's normal. see, ‚Äò‚Äô‚ÄôThe Evil Masterminds (TM)‚Äô‚Äô‚Äô wanted entire world, would invest nanobots. remain dormant, wait till everyone infected, flip switch. viruses, either kill many hosts spread far, allow individuals eventually build (some) immunity/find vaccine Lol edited comment hahahaha. Made day, thanks preserving history :) Yes hear ya, share dark sarcasm/lack sympathy people refuse vaccine get sick, I'll offer another perspective someone works ICU:

We still take care them. still watch die. still put body bags. still dangerously close completely overwhelmed healthcare system, running ventilators, running supplies, etc etc etc.

Nurses doctors fried, burned out, statistically 50% us dealing mental health issues like PTSD past year, soooo close light end tunnel. starting sleep better week insomnia back thinking go back pandemic mode. gone almost 4 months without tell patient breathe could try facetime family going ventilator would likely last time spoke, twice week.

Not asking sympathy - unfortunately chose career involves trying stop natural selection killing people run straight jaws death stupidity... tired afraid.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: typos Given community spread likely late much time lies first jab second. Delta Still affects vaccinated , would dumb certain amount daily deaths Another day looks like falling cases UK. Fingers crossedü§û Man hit bus asks reversed parent Florida petrified. 1500 kids daughter‚Äôs school, masks social distancing. daughter 12 fully vaccinated minority. encourage anything, contrary telling OP likely long-term organ damage...

The thing is, know. Nobody encouraging anything here. I'm stating super unlikely long-term damage would come reference something incidence rate 0.0006%. Good logic right there.

The thing two heart inflammations happen time time certain people. highly unlikely specifically related vaccines, vaccines trigger immune response rare cases lead conditions. first all, super duper rare, second long-term well treatable, third, people likely would gotten anyways infection lives, maybe even real Covid. Seems like delta push variants extinction eventually almost little symptoms  Yet 99% current icu patients unvaccinated. Crazy CDC promoting something actually working keep people icu ventilators (you know, machines emergently building year ago). also, pressuring CDC make changes? Oh that‚Äôs right, dumb assholes  outdoor focused recreation place fine. Vegas, lots open space. Israels Delta problem worse now? Probebly somewhere  Remember get flu shot helps protect others way getting covid shot helps protect others. like idiots, believes smartest person room. like odds, bet life like you‚Äôre ignorant. Read book point remorse people choose get vaccine. (immunocompromised don‚Äôt count since can‚Äôt choose)  Taiwan? Singapore? much larger nations able follow similar pattern NZ. 

If globally strategy elimination strong border measures removal domestic populations - may strategy moving forward similar SARS, MERS contagious viruses - UK able too. 

The Uk screwed lack leadership. know testimony people previously part response. growing calls scientific community within UK follow elimination strategy start conversation international conditions elimination. I‚Äôm American, illegal right? Yep. live low vaccine rate area, doctor told we're going public all, we're getting exposed virus. vaccinated, chances developing anything minor symptoms slim, despite high risk category. vaccines prevent exposed Covid like kind virus repelling force field barrier. still breathe virus still enters body. vaccines help immune system fight quickly efficiently. guy maths.  define ""long term""? 6 months? 6 years? 40 years? goalpost moving ""I wanna wait X"" game play patented bullshit. gonna roll CVS day finally saw ""The Study"" convinced vaccine safe even literally others come far backing up? Highly freaking doubtful.

Anyone telling they're waiting see ""long term effects"" yanking chain really want say truth ""I'm scared ignorant, want belief cling order feel part tribe. Antivax tribe"" takes longer week second shot reach full protection. Also, usually takes longer week infection death likely already infected prior second shot.  Captain wants go SS Dipshit. Lol holy shit dude.  Sounds good me! wonder getting infected covid double vaccinated might increase efficacy even more. countries Europe, proven covid infection followed later one jab developed immune response 2 jabs someone never covid. obviously nobody wants catch covid you‚Äôre double jabbed get mild/asymptomatic infection, wonder that‚Äôs positive things body‚Äôs future immune response virus? agree entirely science. course element chance giving first jabs without second jabs hand. moments looked like might EU export blockade people first dose Pfizer would issue. news gamma variant? article saying found higher morbidity mutation genome can‚Äôt find anything else. 
I‚Äôm getting really worried, I‚Äôm vaccinated stressing out. always surprised difference scientists. Great analogy, consider stolen! Asking real questions here. Yes luck definitely plays part, big part luck location. New Zealand middle nowhere geographically speaking. 

If New Zealand located U.K. is, example strategy would possible. already know brilliance comment underappreciated. 80% figure includes immunized vaccination infection.

And polls, here's [the recent 1% vaccinations.
* 54% ready get vaccinated COVID - question worded ""Are ready get vaccinated personally"" (there's difference planning ready).
* 54% ready, 41% said get vaccinated COVID circumstances. So, 54% \* 41% = 22% + 1% = 23% population going get vaccinated COVID all.

P.S.

They seem forgotten translate part text - ""In case ready get vaccinated?"" chart text Cyrillic reads ""When another/foreign vaccine"" Office Inspector General audits cdc Ya boy vaxxin see Delta tell square up. pure speculation, point feels like Pfizer/BionTech looking additional revenue. Rich countries soon vaccinated, keep making money this? Boosters and/or new variants.

Poor countries, meanwhile, still resources vaccinate people. Increasing chances new variants thus revenue vaccine makers.

Again, pure speculation.  bad part variant dangerous original strain. would really help infectious strain, less lethal. would let morons want get vaccinated immune, less deaths amongst them. People free unvaccinated *only* agree give children away stay away public. People allowed freely abuse can't defend themselves. ""It already way"" mean good. whether personally decide post given platform change opinions millions people influenced (which turn affects me). ""Just use it"" solve anything concern *other people* influenced. results first large scale study come end 2022. can‚Äôt really say safe effective. miss part said I've fully vaccinated Pfizer? I've done part, idiot anti vax'ers keeping going US violent nutters, even attacking health care workers.

You guys thank GOP Fox (and like) stirring dimwitted uneducated Republicans. True, vaccinated, even fewer need hospitalization. 15-20x fewer. (I'm looking 40% hospitalized coming vaccinated people UK, 90-95% vaccination)  Anyone remember cold/flu season WINTERTIME?

Communicable diseases typically peak summer. 

Gonna rough winter... Israeli study, 40% participants immunocompromised. reflect overall population all. make sick - cause symptoms - WAAAAYY lesser degree actual Covid would.  symptoms since Monday. Got oxymeter, far ok. Thank you!  let's say half people vaccinated half (let's say 1000 each). let's say number people got covid 200, 100 vaccinated people 100 vaccinated people. would mean 0% effective.

What looking like 120 people covid, 20 vaccinated 100 unvaccinated people. ~80% effective (i pulled number backside show concept, actual effectiveness higher). 


But say anything exposure health problems. fact things likely reason part vaccinated people got covid: different exposure, preexisting health problems, ...



So people high risk vaccination also higher risk vaccination. Basically risk 10 times lower. remember right pepole 60 risk already ~50 times higher risk younger people. means unvaccinated young person lower risk vaccinated old person. also means young healthy person risk always low vaccinations risk even lower. 



So number (and general covid risk number) consider things like exposure age. average research find specific risk factors. anybody idea well Janssen holds delta? search google met 2 studies one saying it‚Äôs great another saying it‚Äôs shit UK, massive pressure start vaccination program hospitalisations deaths, necessarily cases. Even single dose effective preventing severe symptoms death, maximising number single doses strategy would bring hospital bed use quickly possible.

And seems worked. moment, skyrocketing cases far fewer hospitalisations deaths we've seen previous waves. Wow, date second one?! Ok thanks yeah raving loon internet clearly better biochemist experts field

why go ahead link us dissertation, Doctor? get grad degrees again?  know anything 'long covid' issues 2 jabs? That's I'm concerned about, particularly UK. know people suffered, 2 jabs. know anything 'long covid' issues 2 jabs? That's I'm concerned about, particularly UK. know people suffered, 2 jabs. ok get second shot, soon getting procedure done?

I need get root canal. appointment rescheduled twice getting frustrating. want get last shot know ok so. logic body trying heal root canal (or whatever else), maybe best idea fight virus too. 

Maybe I'm thinking it. tooth needs actually started hurt night first shot. I'm sure coincidence. definitely little nervous now. Oh anticipation‚Ä¶..I love good laugh.  Thank God, worried would turn basically nothing ""I also strongly suspect delta ... might go like bomb under-vaccinated communities,""

Hopefully, folk see coming get vaccinated time. catch covid first it'll late. Infection direct result transmission.

Less transmission = less infection. mean 100% eligible people got vaccine would absolutely herd immunity

herd immunity mean absolutely nobody gets sick, would mean disease either dies becomes isolated Contamination likely inside makes sense drop mask outside first. think special 1 50 might get seriously ill?  Everything I've read suggests almost deaths among unvaccinated. Texas, example, [all 43 9000 covid deaths since February among 

Assuming 40% Texans vaccinated enjoy 88% protection infection (higher older variants) then, math, 17x lower death rate vs. unvaccinated friends. There's actually lots studies AZ Pfizer. seen one official study mixing two mrna vaccines yet  long sick? take 10 days symptoms go bad. Buy oxymeter monitor levels. Call emergency services saturation goes 90%. like UK Thank you. convinced get second jab tomorrow. mean, planning using forever?

COVID, especially delta, contagious enough even 10-20% population getting vaccinated would allow continue mutating. US 40% without vaccination.

It's unfortunate, COVID going endemic going forward, least regionally. Unless going wear N95 mask anytime around people forever know point stop wearing 

Like get wrong, wear want, intend wearing forever I'm fully vaccinated see point would come future suddenly makes sense stop wearing masks.

Btw anecdotally friend mine neurosurgery resident told N95 masks fit tested literally every time put on(which non-trivial procedure apparently), without fit testing they're virtually useless well. N95 masks disposable meant used one 12 hour shift maximum. unless buying new one professional fit test every time wear one...  wish could sign get done.  what's take even infectious diseases list came be? government purposefully hiding numbers prevent another lockdown occurring die. Guardian article seem link original study. anyone that? 

Also I'd really like see study results week-by-week analysis dosing. sounds even idiotic adequate German bureaucracy, I'll believe irrational, vast majority nothing mild inconvenience yet people clamor lifted... they're crying wear masks school soccer games 60.000 people sitting, 18 months Uni would staple mask face meant getting back once... Glad wife vaccinated mild symptoms. Makes taking care young children less daunting isolated waiting fully recover Sure, BBC really leading headline like that, study funded populist government supports government policy.  least reviewed disinterested scientists.

For example, says study done 500 NHS staff; that's hardly going representative whole population. primary defense vaccine, still wear masks socially distance Side effects *can* pretty bad. husband super sick shot, fever, body-wracking shivers, aches...

He still would go go ICU again. talking nonsense, viruses behave explain. mutation hopping person person, mutations happen sporadically pure change. driving force selection mechanism due vaccine immunity even tiniest bit immunity help fight virus, certainly driving mutations.

You probably place bacteria viruses equal footing, vastly different beasts. Bacteria build in-body resistance antibiotics, different organism compared virus (a virus organism begin with). Interesting moderna required 4 weeks us.  country let people who've covid one shot ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø Thinking Australia, sooner later vaccinated - asymptomatic - person infected COVID unwittingly bring Delta cities them. Hope people prepared. Dude question awesome here's why.

You 3 people.
1 somehow never gets sick even exposed hospital
The 2 always get sick 

Why 1 stay area 2 can't.

Ive asking years every girl date gets sick anywhere near ill stay room hours get nothing employer allow people choose get vaccinated continue working? even get COVID already missed many days work vaccinated

the idiots choosing vaccines hill die going left absolute worst, lowest paying jobs choice employment. Hong Kong makes think testing sufficient even death number accurate infections significantly harder (though impossible) transmit

I think makes difference.

If setting someone Covid-19 asymptomatic symptomatic, transmit it. seen first hand Australia asymptomatic people spreading amongst community causing major lockdowns.  point believe people got pfizer anything else

especially US case. maybe britain AZ prevalent, US pfizer would dwarf everything else. think moderna able ship even 20% much. Guidance mean thing know unvaccinated people follow it, many state local governments implement mandates make them. sucks people like vaccinated, unless actual mask mandates put place certain places situations antivaxers/antimaskers going follow guidelines. fair Healthcare workers mandates place. Maybe families get vaccinated?  literally said wearing masks pointless unless sick.

So yeah, right trying conserve masks. statement absolutely untrue based data  thought efficacy rates based upon symptomatic infection/death/hospitalization ""hoped"" would sterilizing immunity, seems exceedingly likely evidenced Israel there's 110 fold increase number cases documented last forty days amongst one earliest heaviest vaccinated populations. Vaccines provide least 65% protection pretty good. That's without boosters, would improve protection, rest world needs vaccines need boosters. People still need get vaxed, even they've covid, amount immunity infection variable, protection narrower vax, designed broader. People covid vax darn near bulletproof seems. Thanks, find anything looking  course ""seriously ill"" relative term - anecdotal evidence I'm seeing city's subreddit would suggest there's fair amount breakthrough infections still knocking people asses days/weeks, possibly opening long haul. 

I'm arguing enough cause closures, advisory wear masks seem line, areas spreading uncontrolled. Austin graph daily hospitalizations steady 45 degree angle upwards weeks now. J&amp;J showing best Delta, sure feel stupid. produces anti-body response tested South African strain, means, J&amp;J Nothing ""causes"" variant. Viruses mutate time. variations make viruses weaker, stronger, difference. strong survive, weak die. variant strong enough cause problems give name. Like hurricanes. Oh absolutely. people aren‚Äôt confused. They‚Äôre willfully ignorant.  I'd argue decision advise public masking *was* data based. based data US could supply masks general public important protect medical workers. screw open honest part equation. I've heard given excuses.  tested see covid? Same. know 2 vaxxed people Covid lost taste/smell. Everything else mild (slight cough, sneezing initially).

I friends still taste/smell back normal 7+ months ago. I'm curious see long takes vaxxed friends recover alters any. Viruses mutate *constantly* it‚Äôs matter ones get passed around enough times host dies. ones able infect kill less able continue infecting hosts live pass others. requires new product. vaccines perceived best market world literally fighting them. I‚Äôd ride developing new products. mean...Ben Carson Rand Paul. Getting hit car death sentence. people end paralyzed get brain damage. 

And long machine breathe you, what's problem?  great data saying current recommended interval (up 6 weeks) works. 

I think got mine days sooner recommended, I'm worried. get light exposure virus, act booster need actual boosters future. Hope pays pocket next time. lot professional athletes US taken vaccine yet despite teams pushing get vaxxed. plenty anti-vax athletes there. smart enough keep opinions avoid bad PR.   untrue. vaccines developed, trialed, authorized premise ability prevent symptomatic disease. Maybe bit both.. good excuse logical reason emotional ones cant backed logic.  Reddit post 5 day 74% HGH testosterone natural chemicals tapshead.memepeg people think they‚Äôve flu, haven‚Äôt flu. kindly ask help interpreting graphs? 

So looking scenario D, low vaccination high transmissibility model. terms cases deaths, solid lines appear par spring 2021. However look shaded areas including 95% CIs, potential cases deaths rise worst times January 2021. right? good wait 2022 it... since chances getting spreading astronomically small.

They astronomically small. greatly reduced, areas lot spread, particularly rare vaccinated people symptoms (it 1/10th 3/10ths likely unvaccinated, depending data use) asymptomatic vaccinated people also spread disease.

Your chances hospitalized dying become very, small, though.  Yup üò¨ She‚Äôs younger 12? asked question, said vaccinated flu point view one side boiled essence: meaningless happens me.  plenty extra people stupid take, might well give someone will. Right, told get 2nd 4 weeks  say something like: ""um...I know like five people got it. 1 ended hospital""

They scream ""AnEcDoTaL!!""

And data comes later, shows happening quite bit.....and move next overly optimistic approach.  anyone know obtain authentic K95 masks child size? need something fit 12 year old. Adult bit big. kids? kid throw niqab got rid this? case rate 12 per 100,000

The UK got level April delta hit. Becuase there's drug vaccine use production capacity *more* profitable amount work, rather that. That's mean opportunity costs: Pfizer would probably prefer capital facilities used something manufacturer therefore charge monopolistic prices for.  ""especially they‚Äôve taken care themselves"" mean? Excellent post! ever worked pharmacy, quickly realize many doctors dumb hell. may good field focused besides that, they're dumb hell.  Guess brawn brains great way live moment... stupidest things read here.  Please breed Agreed it‚Äôs concern, sentiment least strong enough completely outcompeted delta. means there‚Äôs reasonable chance we‚Äôll see something outcompete delta coming months Ah classic vaccine complaint fallacy
1. Complains variants getting created virus 
2. Admits never getting vaccinated part problem variants getting created

You seem uneducated like want complain sake I‚Äôm going mute you. going controversial say f*** them. hell vaccinated people go way protect them? never masked/socially distanced, helped spread rest us. refuse vaccinate well. deal consequences opinion. no, Im going way mask public (unless another mandate happens), becuase anyone isnt vaccinated get care. seems reasonable. far guess, there's reason getting booster future option way achieve longer term protection. holds, fast initial coverage good defensive strategy leaves door open upgrading later needed. wear mask indoors public place. don‚Äôt plan stop. Outside think know it‚Äôs much less likely occur. vaccinated, catch COVID, tickle throat, tickle might symptom infection, vaccinated, catch COVID tickle probably beginning fever, severe respiratory issues set in. vaccinated, that's experienced, would even get test? feeling kind same. worthless, cease normal activities except work Delta surge moronic anti-vaxxers. Guess I'll mask much glad I'm Vaccinated. EUA matter weeks, yea. think original question legitimate. ""expedited"" review take average 6 months rather than, say, 5, 4, 3, 2 months? Yeah it‚Äôs like $18 two tests. also able drive testing Walgreens son without doc order. wish part standard panel. Flu, strep, covid done. Wow. Masks protect others protect you. let‚Äôs let immunocompromised people die unwilling deal slight discomfort. Mask mandates returning aren‚Äôt - they‚Äôre creating blanket restrictions unvaccinated people wear masks. don‚Äôt wear mask, won‚Äôt either. kind vaccine passport? course. don‚Äôt, ask, refusing selfish harmful. Watching opening ceremony Olympics, Kazakhstan team saw without masks... bot sucks  It‚Äôs business. product would benefit selling more. Instead selling everyone 2 shots, 3?

If want conspiracy go full batshit say deliberately selling poor countries, helping virus mutate crazier variants end selling vaccines.

But would crazy. I‚Äôm definitely saying case. evidence all. quite frankly don‚Äôt want believe true. living normally bud use Covidactnow.org  
Good hear guys tracking break throughs. 
My state (Michigan) not, least I‚Äôd publishing data. 
Agreed sympathy unvaccinated CHOICE. 
Young kids aren‚Äôt part demographics though. 

On related note, think need consider great vaccines symptomatic infection. 
Their efficacy asymptotic infection less though. 
I left wondering aren‚Äôt people vaccinated carriers without knowing virus. 
Sure less likely spread it. 
Statistically speaking issue us vaccinated, point consider legitimately exposed population still. guarantee he's religious. people need come Jesus moment. adddressed people believe God protecting them:
God going heal you. special anyone else. belief killing folks. must make decisions take responsibility save yourself, can't throw God. Pre-destination way live good way die. read Stephen Harmon twitter thread, faith - died alone scared. Use free get vaxed! Man. people whole lot stupid. I‚Äôm glad live area education, books, science valued. feel sorry poor nurses. many people think can't get COVID vaccine makes want rip hair nah, someone asks vaccine got they'll say Moderna, Pfizer, Johnson Johnson Full vaccination required attend games. Period. saving face, agreement olympic committees nation hosting games things cancelled performed committee's liking extreme financial That's big though. boosters lower risk breakthrough cases? 

What breakthrough cases due loss immunity, need delta variant specific vaccine? case, boosting exact vaccine may pointless really need boost delta specific vaccine. 

To booster talk focused boosting we've already got that's big needed helpful be. Fair enough. I‚Äôll leave clearly far identity politics brainwashing rational conversation. Take care  Friends Cali visit Hawaii. went Hawaii locals said go Vegas. Vegas, asked locals said go new Orleans...

There trail went cold 80%+ travelers/delegations (athletes, coaches, doctors, etc.) Olympics vaccinated. That's referring to. Unfortunately there's lot going around lately. make room, I'll add ""(Delta)"" ""Variants"" link bottom, collection [Variant] vs. [Vaccine] matchup studies. (the vaccine wins every time) Indeed. Moderna ramp deliveries August September, timing fortuitous. It‚Äôs around long time. Already believed come US get Canada. It‚Äôs nothing. curious well‚Ä¶ wonder percentage people India antibodies (either vaccine catching it) think there's lack data this. year in, unconscionable army epidemiologists collecting data, prepare us next pandemic.

Just level rhetoric, weird cases long-COVID among vaccinated experience breakthrough infections neglected focus number vaccinated people ventilators. Narratives reassurances vaccinated die Delta-varient parrot COVID deniers said nothing worry kill rate low enough ignore it.

I'm claiming conspiracy anything. messaging -- evidence gathering -- needs worked up.  stopped following sub months bc getting called 0 0 e r despite right Every. Single. Time. still irritates tf outta people still think kids get it, especially Delta main variant.

I edited posted bc apparently that's somehow uncivil? hate reddit.  Yeah, start tally July 1st it'll mean something.   I‚Äôve used mine Germany Austria required dining, museums, etc Imagine today on, Dems GOP switch ground covid vaccinations. idiots rush get jabs?  Juneau 79.5% vaccinated 12+ population. cases spiking, it‚Äôs clear yet whether new cases vaccinated population. really right. intensity original illness matters lot. really severe cases (hospitalizations +) overreaction immune system eventually causes serious complications (at least working hypothesis ago). cause anything, original infection somewhat high intensity, mean necessarily complications. vaccine, cases stopped pretty early on, original infection much less severe, thus causing less long-covid well less hospitalizations worse. guy probably failed math Get rest! wonder would like us one dose Pfizer one Moderna. may blame education system, misinformation social media naive individuals susceptible conspiracy theories, much, much that.

This total deep seated mistrust fundamental institutions, healthcare, government, media, public safety, growing deeper deeper day. saying  estimates 50% pre Delta. anywhere planet Delta actually *killing* people large numbers? way know til someone study. Haven‚Äôt seen anything yet raise expectations feel like major factor.  8 far, FYI. Although VoIs rather  One shot ought it. I‚Äôm gonna guess hasn‚Äôt documented among vaccinated really hope you‚Äôre joking. choice facial hair says all; guess let wear shades ICU. That's.... Well comfort level. Thank posting this, it‚Äôs reassuring know they‚Äôre beginning study efficacy long gap. Yeah it‚Äôs mild. fever, pain. Basically headache, nausea wet cough honestly isn‚Äôt even bad. think worst part anxiety attack ensued seeing positive results.   ""Mild"" symptomatic infection needing supplementary oxygen, wide spectrum covers everything sniffles worst flu ever experienced.

The clinical communication pretty poor. Nobody outside healthcare settings actually thinks way. really need middle-ground layman-accessible spectrum symptom definitions, something along lines ""cold-like"", ""flu-like"", ""heavy flu,"" people actually understand relate to. 

Which brings back Israel's findings. wonder they're collecting much wider array symptoms? 

It also needs made clear people can't treat vaccines like magic shield.  degree become ill function exposure. virus exposed to, sicker get. Vaccines raising threshold (and probably ceiling most), get exposed enough virus, get sick matter what. Two questions: 

J&amp;J I'm assuming shit Delta? 

Can people got J&amp;J go get Pfizer Moderna? sounds like Moderna numbers since dose 3.3 times Pfizer highly effective single dose. Moderna even better. would nice media would shut hell Delta then. vaxxed great. (entirely choice way) own. Per Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) used collect reports adverse events vaccination general public. primarily used identify potential topics investigate regards vaccine reactions. However, event data VAERS often verified often self-reported, assumed adverse events VAERS actually associated cause vaccines, possible estimate frequency adverse events data.

Abstract 
Objectives Setting. 
As lethal COVID-19 pandemic enters second year, need effective modalities alleviation remains urgent. includes modalities readily used public reduce disease spread severity. preventive measures early-stage treatments may temper immediacy demand advanced anti-COVID measures (drugs, antibodies, vaccines) help relieve strain also health system resources. 
 
Design Participants. 
We present results clinical study multi-component OTC ‚Äúcore formulation‚Äù regimen used multiply exposed adult population. Analysis clinical outcome data sample 100 subjects ‚àí comprised roughly equal sized regimen-compliant (test) non-compliant (control) groups meeting equivalent inclusion criteria ‚àí demonstrates strong statistical significance favor use core formulations. 
 
Results. 
While groups moderate size, difference outcomes 20-week study period large stark: 4% compliant test group presented flu-like symptoms, none test group COVID-positive; whereas 20% non-compliant control group presented flu-like symptoms, three-quarters (15% overall control group) COVID-positive. 
 
Conclusions. 
Offering low cost, readily implemented anti-viral approach, study regimen may serve, least, stopgap modality and, perhaps, useful tool combatting pandemic.  Yeah, whole article needed sort reputable reference. Scary Thank you!

I'm mixing vaccines use argument time. issue Canadians issues travelling countries consider us ""fully vaccinated"" 2 different mRNA vaccines.

I feel study showing shows still effective potentially effective would change way countries view mixing mRNA. I‚Äôve seen newborns stores too. finally feeling comfortable enough go maskless large uncrowned stores. increasing cases delta variant convinced mask again. make 18 month old masks? might like made superhero fabrics.

Tbf, sports leagues much better vaccination rates general public. example, NFL currently 14 teams 85% think every team 50%. expect higher time season starts. Given lack major outbreaks NBA, imagine also well vaccinated. Great post. Another thing want people afraid risk GBS J&amp;J, detailed I've seen lot worry people regarding USDA's report, want put perspective. 


I GBS. diagnosed variant 2019. Hospitalized, intubated, completely paralyzed two weeks, used walker/cane another couple months. disease pretty awful, extremely rare. still got vaccine even warning released. 


According [National Institute Neurological Disorders GBS estimated affect 1 person 100,000 year, 0.001% people. currently 100 reports GBS 12.8 million doses, 0.000781% people. 
 
This significantly lower rate overall average reported cases. personally got Pfizer, think dissuade people getting vaccine already. vaccine(s) safe, prevent lot pain suffering. 4 weeks apart Ireland got doses,If again,(here Japan)I would space doses 3 weeks.

We much people vaccinated.I cannot spend 8 weeks 1 dose.

I want booster course available us,though,immunocompromised people like niece (I think I'm always talking her.we worried.)should get first.Her B-cell working well. Stupidity kill. summer session. 

ps--my son's uni offered ""insurance"" $80 would allow us get small portion money back ($6k) case able attend classes. took it.  Fuck chances another country, competition U.S. isn‚Äôt going send plane load virus laden superspreaders mingle athletes Olympic village?  I‚Äôm looking you, China. grocery couple days ago. Vaccinated mask-free, record. mandate place. man business attire wandering around store mask hanging chin... fuck??  Hey let put lifetime aspirations Olympics greater risk getting safe, free vaccine. Fucking brilliant move guys!

As side note, know cases someone can't vaccinated doubt case these. understand people can't simple preventive measures bit longer 

Because us, ""simple."" may able tolerate mask long periods, many us can't. quite frankly, responsibility keep kids safe. worried risk them, take go places. 

Look, fact likely weeks grace period anyway Delta variant gets control among unvaccinated (and even possibly learns evade vaccines much effectively currently does) lockdowns reimposed. would support move. meantime, going enjoy weeks going out, breathing freely, luxuriating experience smiling people able see smile back me, able actually hear people saying without say ""what?"" half dozen times three sentence exchange, flinging several feet side whenever see another human approaching. vaccinated gives ability, right, enjoy things, even little while. Roughly 50 million people catch 11 days. day 14 roughly 2.5 billion people catch it. day 21 matter anymore. even allowed go? Stupid AOC. Apparently people still too. Like don‚Äôt want admit tricked. children passing adults

Any adult vaccinated point millions children lost primary secondary caregivers?

You must talking globally? think there's ""millions"" kids US lost parents, 600k died US. solution going forward adults get vaccinated (should already there's still time get jab school starts). 

If mom anti-vaxxer, I'm sorry see that's society's fault gets covid. that's smokes 2 packs day gets lung cancer. can't smoke weed night help anxiety team allowed team covid vax. Awesome 

Into country risk covid well. though, sending unvaccinated means bringing home gold: best variant global circus provide.

It's year, know shit works.  You‚Äôre lucky live place considerate people. Even masks required, huge portion people live refused wear them. employees stores never said single thing. honestly don‚Äôt blame for, considering violent people get it. Cause games happening Tokyo US's problem shit goes bad. needed come IOC country going put restrictions athletes competing. (Unless athlete smoking weed, case would banned Olympics üôÑ) Understood, agree. think still boggles mind mandatory every participating country attending athletes support staff, let along IOC. seems like complete no-brainer. Conflating transmissible effectiveness masks?

Tell Asians countries wear time flu? fun, course it‚Äôs 2020 found covid slightly transmissible. would wear masks then? people wore masks Spanish flu? 

How much stopped transmission argument outright told masks weren‚Äôt effective countries fully aware. say worried procuring masks frontline, 100% knew offered protection, supply. 

Seems like you‚Äôre eating suggesting debate much air travel meant doubt effectiveness masks. Crazy think even admitted ruse people still pretend wasn‚Äôt settled science decades. Right? wish wanting get sick, wanting spread illness, seen positive social values, like least thought COVID.  They‚Äôre phase final phase booster trial haven‚Äôt seen anything ends. mortality rate breakthrough cases usually proven elderly immune compromised. Doesn‚Äôt make less tragic; however, that‚Äôs I‚Äôve gathering. map provided article, impressed Chile Uruguay - 60% fully vaccinated, much ahead developed countries, much better infrastructure. literally says infection rate around 50% article! We‚Äôre basically flipping coin every time we‚Äôre around unmasked people now. kerfuffle pfizer (or BNT?), though idea that's reason.

In theory moderna higher dose given apart pfizer, make marginally better. think J&amp;J near market penetration two had. far zero.  No, us want restrictions kids get vaccinated. want mandates healthcare workers vaccinated (that they're already choice insane). Police, fire, EMS, public health workers vaccinated. Members Congress vaccinated. Unvaccinated people due refusal allowed certain environments, like airline travel. someone mentioned above, there's world zero covid throwing hands nothing. bet... wife vote (I foreigner can't vote anyway) recognize governor done good job (with minor snafus -- hey human). fully support decisions day-1 pandemic. certainly arguments providing medical care criminals. novel.

As someone taking risks, real question risks choose take negatively impact others. Saving lives skydivers materially increase risk skydivers falling innocents. 

However providing safety net medical care may enjoying vaccine reluctance increases spread disease.

Also want pay it. refuse free vaccine, get hospitalized, run hundreds thousands ICU charges, know can't pay. Ultimately public foots bill choices. add insult injury party consistently fought universal medical care. say give keep asking for, demand cash front send home. causes CDC state governments institute universal restrictions mandates. 

Otherwise...No. Let cull herd. can't care someone care themselves. dumb, rick someone US planning elective surgery last months year, hope unvaccinated people consume much hospital resources postpone. way insurance works US would cost thousands postponed next year.  Right? personal choice, unvaccinated covid patients would dedicated hospital something. personal choice clearly affects entire health care system. Americans causing chaos Delta you! you! Delta everyone! son-in-law thinks he's smarter so-called doctors. Yeah way 50% doctors anti vax. 

Nurses believe. Knowing several personally gone many classes nursing school building, I‚Äôm sadly shocked. 

I mean anyone wants know, 2 years community college enough get nurse (depending). disrespect nurses all, ones I‚Äôve hard extremely dedicated hard working kind/caring (and doctor attest fact without hospitals would collapse, seriously mean disrespect). education knowledge doctor. Fantastic game!

FYI came 

iOS - 26 May 2012
Android - 4 October 2012 Oh! realize Israel went lower 64% reporting. Wow! Love it. You‚Äôre proven wrong, deflect bring totally unrelated argument. love see it!

Also, kids die car accidents per year, that‚Äôs reason take safety measures around pool less kids die pools versus cars. argument asinine, especially since don‚Äôt know everything long term effects COVID kids. Plus, swimming pools aren‚Äôt airborne virus. can‚Äôt spread drowning amongst population. easy way prevent kids getting sick rather suggesting let burn them. don‚Äôt allow flu burn kids, vaccinate them, too.

Vaccine approval kids within sight. doesn‚Äôt hurt take precautions get it. internal polling must brutal. usually double bad policy. mean gee...maybe people get vaccinated then. Got it. Yeah probably going go retirement work college/hs level then. 

It's bold move NFL. mandating vaccine adverse effects would treated workplace injury opens liability. think that's we've seen many businesses US shying away going like this. nope hospital decisions. like drug users smokers dying early. Headline factual, conclusions drawn good. problem is, CDC changed mask guidance, vaccinated people could go without masks. Unvaccinated people never supposed take off. supposed continue making social distancing entire time.

Clearly didn't.

So guidance flawed. needed something like vaccine passport. predicted many us, there's way tell who's honest good citizen enjoying going maskless due vaccinated, unvaccinated, taking mask anyway.  I, isolated farmer, vaccinated traveling Olympic athlete representing United States world stage, vaccinated? gonna start frat strains. Make sure drink Alpha Sigs around! Yikes. Seen things seems pretty bleak. Ok, *the dead parents dead grandparents kids can't vote.* make palatable you? Good, good! Personally, I'm concerned regardless, since kids largely infecting unvaccinated relatives, majority people made minds (speaking misinformation). take cruise ship home together spend quality time port There's nothing report says less 50% efficacy. 88% effective preventing severe illness. That's honestly better anyone expected prior Pfizer Moderna vaccines coming out. hoping 50% effective like flu shot usually is. remember flu shot always prevent getting flu. definitely help die though. same. 

I think we've become used Covid vaccines super effective, panic something drops 95%. 88% still amazing. There's chance, though, covid could endemic much worse form. I've DC metro many times recently, almost everyone wearing masks. someone isn't. People around move. said username outloud make gay fish?  It‚Äôs pain ass science says don‚Äôt need to. spent year trusting experts. 

‚ÄúIf fully vaccinated, resume activities pandemic without wearing mask physically distancing, except required laws, rules, regulations, local guidance.‚Äù

This pretty definitive. I‚Äôm safe. Masks suck. Based CDC, telling need wear mask science doesn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs necessary. Jesus fucking Christ. Every single one morons banned international sports, life.  Imagine stepping away six figure (at minimum) job want take vaccine potentially dangerous disease. understanding (and maybe I‚Äôm wrong) also need proof negative test order get back US. Personally I‚Äôm willing risk testing positive stuck Europe. Plus countries like France Spain reinstating covid restrictions I‚Äôm sure enjoyable trip would really moment. country still restrictions - absolutely. would show current measures working, domestic case loads decreasing (good NHS) fewer fewer people infected.

But - Things working, know they're still working getting worse 10-14 days now. commute NYC NJ 3 days week. Masks still federally MANDATED train Penn Station NYC. Already plenty people wearing masks police station care anything. Cops literally give shit enforcing mask mandates. meant past shots know felt it, needles bigger/not sharp 2 decades ago assume lol Yet media best scare shit people fully vaccinated. week woke hysterical texts parents mask everywhere go crowds again. vaccines.

Ratings every major news network people go back outside trying best scare piss everyone sit around TV's again. Sadly, working people.  smartest people around us. taking medicine. 

Get fucking vaccinated, please. Excellent point.  cdc says everybody mask up, it? 4% removed working directly people. This. want honesty risks children, people cannot vaccinated, people vaccine might work (autoimmune), breakthrough cases different demographics. downright lying say ""You get sick get vaccinated"" ""Even get sick, it'll like little cold."" There's discussion asymptomatic spread vaccinated long covid. They're glossing everything. realize zero covid longer possibility, downright deadly. Tier 1 2 required Loser Well, literally. Concerns/indications vaccine looses good bit efficacy time. Indeed understand downvoted, clearly discrepancy there. Even vaccines safe, feel like put effort earlier good dosages youngs, especially Moderna. 

Anyway, there's Germany EU. Besides, lower dosage proven accepted effective, would many doses young ones doubting around months reached 2.5 billion?  tired people saying ‚Äúvaccines personal choice‚Äù freedom violated job makes get vaccine! think purchasing Moderna. done months ahead avoid exact situation damned damned even understand slogan. one Fauci something? Unless doctor antivaxx tried checking status databases?

They everyone. Even people got vaccinated fully one state, site times, accounted for, let alone got vaccinated multiple states different sites. example, [issues also anecdotally tell I've got multiple coworkers unable validate state's database.

No one knows widespread issues (do states even database), unless checked data got idea one group. risk I'd want take.  Trust me, good coach begin with. honestly might better job anyways. sources this? quickest I've seen 11 days know, interesting discussion, article points us direction need care - ""when vaccinated people start turning hospitals"". 

Personally, think need care even vaccinated people start experiencing infections rates signficantly beyond studies indicated would, real shame CDC decided track infections vaccinated require hospitalization. caught rise infections vaccinated people (which precede rise hospitalizations least couple weeks), would earlier warning failure efficacy could impose new restrictions sooner, would undoubtedly save lives road. conspiracy theory among conspiracy theorists

What? denounced nothing conspiracy theory frequently average person time anyone raised concerns it. also anti-mask, anti social distancing, anti lockdowns

I.e. pro-normal. anti-vaccine

You'll find plenty vaccinated folk domestic vaccine passports too. rest us would like end point.

So giving government yet another inch going answer that? thanks. guess retirement. guy 63 solid history good zone blocking coach. Someone like Browns could pick analyst. Tier 1 coaches required.

It's personal choice take think starting get Vikings run game heading right direction. Pre 2019 fairly poor oline  recent surge Netherlands certainly gives new meaning [the Dutch booster targets newer variants really think need change distribution process rich countries stop hoarding wasting vaccines. like EU millions AstraZeneca vaccines refused use ages everyday people dying disease countries, countries would gladly taken them. mean considering vaccination attempt block something he'd rather take sack, looks like Vikings made right call.  4,000 kids US die drowning year.

Too many Americans mentality ""I want party fun without mask, want doctors nurses clean mess."" Fucking THL joke. work colleague told 100k prediction could believe it. Lots people got antibodies first couple waves even virus R0 8 cannot spread well highly vaccinated/immunised population. Unfortunately nobody wanted take wager... actually straight copied policy France, seems opened new system combat pandemic think used EU contries. Memorized Greek alphabet back high school, useful useless trivia pays occasionally. Hold up. also think masks 0% effective?

Because I'm done. point arguing you. US, 80% 65 fully 16 39 less 50% vaccinated. pretty - 48%

18-24 - 43%

Dismal.  100 losers. percentage republicans gotten vaccine? ‚ÄúChildren vulnerable‚Ä¶‚Äù no. wildly inaccurate. /r/masks4all May able help  surprise Olympics cancelled.

Ok so, freedom choice Nope. inaccurate Israel vaccinated first reported reduction vaccine efficacy probably indication falling efficacy time. would agree felt like republicans cared others all.

Their stances even make ""Put kids back everyone wear mask ""Mask mandates ""The virus made lab China! ""Are going wear mask get vaccinated help slow spread ""NO!

I don‚Äôt know science, sounds like recipe create super variant. 

I‚Äôm grabbing popcorn. 100% agree France celebrates International Kissing Day point feel like allowing vaccinated unvaccinated people different things completely pointless unless there's way enforce it. sort people still vaccinated point US going accept different rules vaccinated people. 

Restrictions like apply everyone one may well apply one anti-vax people going ignore anyway. 

I guess exception could events possible physically ban people getting tickets they're unvaccinated. Typical East German judge. Yea air exhaled goes eyes taken care proper sealing

CFS/ME exacerbated strong vaccines, booster shot possible outweighing outcomes. Cops ordered job exactly sort thing fails. trouble preventing sorts behavior they've chosen take issue with.

When relevant officials decide mandates actually mandatory, work. fact probably vaccinated people hospitalized entirely dumbasses refused vaccinate absolute travesty. absolutely not. still reasonable chance contracting virus asymptomatically spreading it.

...and masking going change that. think masks magic bullet? They're mediocre solution depended paired strict social distancing effective. together acceptable temporary solution found better way. vaccines WAY effective, point adding mask top vaccinated person WITHOUT distancing negligible change efficacy. 

So unless proposing bring back business restrictions distancing requirements pair masks. symbolic act masking vaccinated people anything make feel good.

Luckily elderly parents think way. also depends country. initial rollout targeting high risk groups US, vaccines generally available walk-in basis months now, giving younger less risk plenty opportunities get shots.

Many countries behind due limited supply quite likely older/high risk groups high vaccination coverage.

Yes, shooting nation routinely sees far more. Armed robbery also thing. give say robbery permissable sometimes armed, make clear things tolerated.

Non-compliance mask mandates happens key people actually trying. military becoming increasingly bigger every year. 

They things like instead buying aircraft carrier, buy heli carrier mount F-35's it. doubt anyone mandate vaccine FDA approves, instead it'll mandate vaccinated. leverage antivaxxers complain, say concerns safety excuse access FDA approved vaccine. I'm glad moved Germany went down. Looking polarized circus outside, I'm hoping government takes page France mandates vaccinations. looking effects unvaccinated population? [some good news area LA live in? I've lived 7+ different neighborhoods across 15 years (Santa Monica, Westwood, Brentwood, Sawtelle, Culver City, Pasadena, DTLA) everyone around walks takes bus

only suburbs people drive, that's issue is, it?  country sovereignty bullying?

If China declared wanted investigate something country, totally chill letting Chinese government look around?

Also countries mentioned article pretty bad history invading China force. trying investigate without China‚Äôs permission wouldn‚Äôt great look. Ha yea right brain cell talking. David LV Bauer important anything, neither history! Neither trajectory! Get now. Delta wasn‚Äôt present case rates like last month, might worth waiting, now? Hell no. don‚Äôt nearly enough protection one shot.

If there‚Äôs genuine need bump things another level immunity-wise, they‚Äôll authorize boosters sooner rather later, you‚Äôll get extra immunity way. right now, simply isn‚Äôt safe delay second shot. Yeah mean think it. probably disliked politician lifetime. still got votes Trump!

Additionally, one Trump. 

Trump get away things politician can. DeSantis kidding thinks chance presidency. mean minute popularity gets close to, exceeds Trump, Trump turn NY minute. Trumps cult follow leader. 

It‚Äôs definitely interesting election. depended heavily ones situation, luxury people sick old folks home needed shit like yesterday Initial dose makes disease. infective dose requirement higher vaccinated, eating ass every night, COVID gonna catch point.

Death hubris  estimates correct. give many vaccines scheduled. spread lies? really feel like we're crossroads right now. I'm deja vu. No. Covid-19 used leading cause death US. epidemic peak. It‚Äôs dropped considerably since then.

As June 2021, COVID-19 fallen number seven list top ten leading causes death U.S. recently January 2021, COVID number one leading cause death, average 3,136 people dying daily. Amid widespread availability vaccines, number fallen average 300 daily deaths June reason I‚Äôm still living bubble NC  Yes, vaccine key factor here, every adult many children access months (I got mine 5 Jan). never made claim heart disease transmissible. mentioned primary cause death US year year, showed statistics overshadowed COVID opposed claim made previous comment. bet he‚Äôll get wish No, weren‚Äôt that‚Äôs reading, reading wrong things. we‚Äôre case base efficacy would targeted 50%. Less droplets inhaled = lower viral load, no? study earlier variants. published back April.

Some variants potentially less deadly. Delta doesn‚Äôt seem case. Sure, also position luck us here.

What measured accurately yet long term economic costs loss life, loss economic mobility ongoing costs people lasting symptoms/complications post covid-19 infection. 

Smaller poorer nations going get destroyed this. There's guarantee they'll looked after/invested post pandemic. 

I think long term, extermination approach solution. It'll require largest mobilisation resources, international support investment, growing economic cost make worth while. new variant goes vaccinated population, ""isnt bad"" .. 

.. tell effect vaccine, weaker variant? No, one plain wrong well. Damn, Canada wait 4 months  Fair point I've seen really weird anti-shutdown/anti-vax people AUS recently NSW outbreak. deeply confuses me, like see shitty US handling pandemic like... ""yeah, want that!"" Oh. Great. Mutation like watering coffee. 

Some mutations make virus *less* virulent (*less* hardy, infectious, deadly). People usually get excited those. Since they're *less virulent* existing strains, they're likely take dominant strain lot damage. like putting pool noodle sword blade handing sloth. 

Some mutations make virus *more* virulent (*more* hardy, infectious, deadly). problem. like sharpening two swords handing homicidal maniac hopped meth. going bad scene, gonna make news. 

The problem get pick kind mutation happens. 

RNA viruses terrible typists lousy spell check procedures. tend make lot mistakes copying genome. mistakes bad (for us), good, neutral, again, *we* get pick. 

This mutation, dilution. Allow? They‚Äôre giving vaccines like free Halloween candy live. could technically get many shots wanted. Mix match em too. weeks. Based Israel 20% population fully vaccinated US 2% done US hit mark mid April. early benchmarks (10%, 20%, 30%, etc., Israel 2-2.5 months ahead US.

If believe Israel's Ministry Health saying, they're seeing significant drop efficacy people got 2nd dose January February, represents 39% population. 7% US population fully vaccinated months possible evidence waning immunity (if that's what's driving this) much limited US. No, one‚Äôs plain wrong. Primary difference safe effective vaccine prevent Covid decrease severity. also can't spread heart disease people, heart disease virus probability evolving something much worse due continuesly cycling population Sauce BBQ need people wear masks vaccinated.

Here, maybe put bold people finally actually understand point stop arguing things never said:

**People vaccinated still wear masks. APS planning forcing everyone, even vaccinated, keep wearing masks, valid scientific reasons.** lot businesses named Covid clusters US regional local news. 

Sauce US citizen.

Accountability huge businesses Siding Insurance Companies good look......... info Massachusetts ? Instead, catch waves, Hawaii ! message brought Hawaii tourism. So, since Sarah Huckabee Sanders big time Christian ‚Äúpro-life,‚Äù maybe could take break political fund raising try convince constituents get vaccinated? 

Nah, guess not. wondering would coming. Seemed like Jacinda really hoping Oz could pull together avoid needing kill free movement 2 countries. UK tons testing though. US may well missing lot cases, seems unlikely UK. Lol, what? city in? bribe young people cold hard cash. Get vaccine show completed card I'll give $100 more. slippery slope handing voice Zuckerberg whoever else

If read ToS, already hand post something social media. obligation preserve content. shape platform please. way avoid post We're learning species, exceptions. went Ralph's La Crescenta last Saturday (before mandate) walking in, lady without mask who'd walked us 10 feet ahead sneezed directly hand. family kind looked like ""wtf?"" masked lagged behind bit avoided store.

But come on, lady, wtf, like 60 one taught sneeze elbow? wonder everybody's getting sick now.

ETA: right... almost starting feel normal. :( lots masks still everybody thing. LOL, hobby. Please get vaccine. tattoos? And? die get hospitalized? One COVID-19‚Äôs long term side effects death, pretty much longest term side effect.  Massachusetts asymptomatic testing perhaps? 

One thing often happen vaccinated people ""abortive infection,"" someone exposed gets viral particles nose, immune system immediately kills it, dead material still trigger test days. 

So lot vaccinated people getting regular tests even symptoms, going see many positive results dead virus neither infectious contagious.


Or another explanation vaccinated people likely get tested, responsible Covid general. Either way, trust controlled studies like statistical data regarding vaccine effectiveness. mean, able WFH isolate anyways, always brainer wait Pfizer Moderna even back then, regardless people tried shame ""vaccine shopping""  Let‚Äôs see still feels way gets bill. me, would depend entirely need something outside apartment. Like I've got symptoms, I'm gonna self isolate while.

I'm still work home, groceries delivered anyways, big deal go back full isolation couple weeks.

But trip planned, party go something, better bet I'm getting tested going I've got symptoms. still prevent infection, particularly N95.  Anecdotal evidence offset breakthrough cases positive data, wife‚Äôs parents part 1% vaccinated country suffering delta wave even precautions taken perfectly fine even multiple close interactions people testing positive (vaxxed Sputnik btw) 19 days. 
I feel super good it, I'm young healthy hopefully that's enough ensure robust immune response. There's lots factors come play like example vaccine took. However results new England journal medicine shows half year fully vaccinated, antibody count drops factor 8. However, say 8x likely get it, definitely diminishing Yup, also Canada wait second shot. Appointment tomorrow! three-week difference back January &amp; February. saying mean unlikely someone like would benefit 3rd shot? We're even split house (in L.A.) - 2 Pfizer, 2 Moderna. Ah, gotcha, neat. Thanks comment. Actually got something wrong whole spike protein. know forgot.. He's talking new Alberta one probably infected everyone store.  Another thing consider many (not all) asymptomatic infections fully vaccinated people ""abortive infections."" Basically, PCR test detects presence viral RNA, regardless whether viable not.

So vaxxed person exposed Covid, get nasal passages, immune system immediately kills it, still test positive days due dead virus material nose. Even though contagious risk developing symptoms.

This CDC recommend testing asymptomatic fully vaccinated people. turned 5 weeks 3 weeks, got 2nd last sunday. Mexico Canadian study barely included Delta, it‚Äôs useless. UK one promising though, you‚Äôre right. right, know forgot this. actually 67-70% vs infection, misleading title article. actually incorrect, 88% efficacy means 88% less likely catch relative someone vaccinated. case delta variant efficacy dropped 7% r0, many infected person infect, went double, thereby vastly increasing probabilities getting it. also simple r0 doubled therefore probability getting doubled, actually much double exponential growth. Wonder Astra followed Pfizer like.. Smallpox r0 5-8 (so within delta range) kills 30%+, stop equating probably worse disease history humanity covid‚Ä¶ mean could look covid deaths 18 duration pandemic? look June 2021 concerned delta. June, 8 people 18 died covid 7197 covid deaths US. Despite fact least vaccinated demographic US 22% US population. Mine too. Long Covid joke. occur even mild Covid. hope vaccine protective well. we‚Äôre screwed Lots places don‚Äôt school choices.  Good luck. One entries hospital might last. You‚Äôre right never cited 100% effective, *absolutely* championed providing sterilizing immunity vast (95+%) cases. advertised.

With Delta, things changed, that‚Äôs nobody‚Äôs fault. let‚Äôs pretend definition vaccine success hasn‚Äôt shifted. People need keep mind delta variant spreading time almost restrictions precautions lifted. last time occurred March 2020 look deaths recorded NY, northeast couple hot spots. original covid variant may infectious never able test properly back time mass testing mask mandates, lockdowns restrictions. Ro value changes according restrictions place. unfair compare delta variants. saying delta variant contagious needs context. Also, let's forget happened Michigan states March April past year. example, Michigan still restrictions place curfew mask mandates cases still skyrocketing. delta around. Vaccinated people getting infected too. CDC knew stopped recording breakthrough cases early May. data determine breakthrough cases common delta. However, without restrictions increases chance community spread anytime community spread vaccinated people risk. also case almost vaccines. damn. vaccines cool. Unfortunately playing Israel I‚Äôm nervous UK. many countries used Pfizer.  amount times people conflated deterministic probabilistic statements covid shocking PCR finally came back: negative. Check edit comment info.  Yeah, sick. hospital though, right? long? Yes, infection also asymptomatic mild symptoms recognized carrier symptoms virus. study Moderna highest protection delta variant single dose. hospitalization one dose better Pfizer 78% AZ 88%.  Agreed. Real data soon would really reassuring either way. understand though that, due relatively low number J&amp;J recipients, research hasn‚Äôt prioritized. J&amp;J recipient, find frustrating. Well, Earth becomes scorched 500 million years gets consumed bloated sun another billion, destined forever.

Some day extinct. Next year good time any, suppose. try keep small amount optimism even misplaced. rash whole muscle looked like doubled size points woke deep sleep lucid dreams. count COVID arm? super low now, large jump small comparison previous peak (NY state 7 deaths state week), 99.2% hospitalized unvaccinated. concerning. Get vaccinated, pretty much set. lot blowing proportion, contributing vaccine hesitancy

Moron, Covid-19 leading cause death United States.

That's fact. opinon. Whelp, majority people die anti-vaxxers. hope take others them. disagree this. Vaccinated people are, whole, likely (a) mild symptoms (b) think 'can't get infected.' Given combination, vaccinated people likely get tested mild cold symptoms. Meanwhile, unvaxxed people likely feel worse realize there's decent chance covid, therefore get tested. thought 93 percent?  God assholes, ""I've done part"" got vaccinated like rest us, huge sacrifice, invading sub. Yes. specific question benefit file using tobacco increase insurance premiums. ‚ÄúI something everyone should‚Äù never good argument  ironically, insurance lobby likely get needle moving (no pun intended) towards closing herd immunity gap anything else point.

If 100% population vaccinated, virus still spread basic logic tells since vaccine ever protects 100% vaccinated, still going cases, going hospitalizations, going deaths would vaccinated.  


The good news scenario likely talking extremely small numbers people susceptible severe cases. Somewhat like we're seeing Israel right now. Cases jumped considerably there's evidence spread among vaccinated hospitalizations 1/16th previous peak.  That's simple confirmation vaccines working. never meant stop virus spreading, stop hospitals getting flooded sick patients prevent loss life.  


Its knock vaccination discuss that. amazingly effective vaccines still fall cracks, especially highly infectious respiratory virus like this. reality anti vaxers split pretty evenly right left. right trying loyal Trump left vehemently antivax since bogus vaccine/autism thing.

That's cross section general population Early data pre-Delta pointing towards decent longevity vaccine. Basically beginning point towards years (and discussion boosters even necessary). 

As poster said variants probably realistic concern far Pfizer least looked pretty damned good too. Delta certainly showing ability still break vaccinated people (but generally producing still less severe symptoms unvaccinated). He‚Äôs really going in. Whatever could go wrong?  ~~US Military Phonetic alphabet~~

NATO Phonetic alphabet Who‚Äôs locking US? Outside mask mandates there, it‚Äôs business usual. mean experience long term effects virus? That's main worry.   Yup got unvaccinated person. far person spread (Moderna) girl got Pfizer two months ago, two people got Johnson Johnson. We‚Äôre mild cases, worst two got Johnson Johnson lost smell taste (mine came back one day dull senses). That's interesting perspective! 

The report referenced partnership Hollywood Chamber Commerce, hyping economic impact entertainment industry (and includes freelancers reason). surprises underestimating, they'd incentivized count everyone. Ahhh, politicizing virus met match. one party realized harm good. actually 2-3 weeks, really 3 (according nurses). get it. US ton vaccine supply? must begging people take shots...  Mixture pharma companies' recommendations supply demand. 6 weeks biontech 12 Astra here, even though biontech always recommended 3 weeks doses (3 12, believe), supplies short. we've got plenty biontech, demand lower, officials recommend shorten wait delta variant, people get first shot immediately get appointment second three weeks later.

I got first still 6 weeks doses, got mine doctor area demand low supply enough 3 weeks anyway. Can't tell happy made me.  think correct. miss days too. It‚Äôs like 5-6 days people, 14 days estimated conservatively. Hey you. Yeah unvaxinated human reading this.

Go get vaccine please. person begs intubation told late. available data time shows spread fully vaccinated people unlikely. Possible, unlikely. 

Which generally vaccines work. protect initial infection, reduce severity symptoms case breakthrough infection, greatly reduce chances spreading illness others. 

No vaccine ever 100% effective. that's point. soon one more. Getting second shot 2 hours. You‚Äôre wrong feel bad wrong. It‚Äôs backfiring, it‚Äôd firing all.

I‚Äôd much prefer gun shoots 100% time choice right 0% 88% one. chance backfiring (= serious complications vaccine itself) abysmally small chance dying intruder outweighs massively. Explain irony please I‚Äôm wasted agitated. starts GoFund Facebook must held accountable.

It‚Äôs absolutely insane.  study results showed 42 week+ gap best AZ efficacy I'm surprised Pfizer short honest. new vaccine tech new rules may apply... It‚Äôs still good vaccine, great terms preventing serious outcomes. I‚Äôm double vaxxed reason.

Oh well good- doubt must indicate issue settled. look forward reading conclusions next round preprints.  all, 95% stat never entirely applicable variants concern, including around delta.

Major variants concern didn‚Äôt exist time. mentioned nobody reading news opinions scientists critically reached conclusion pandemic ‚Äúover‚Äù. 

Not pandemic - vaccinated individuals, chances getting infected knocked almost zero. animal reservoirs, unvaccinated pockets, etc. knew would endemic - narrative propagated everyone including doctors celebrating efficacy studies vaccines would functionally end spread infection vast majority instances. focus hospitalizations death like people pretending people running around saying ‚ÄúCOVID I‚Äôm vaccinated‚Äù laypeople foolish put much trust people can‚Äôt reason risk nuanced way that.

Yep, sure fucking moron taking consensus vaccine efficacy rates Pfizer Moderna studies completed face value doctors journalists championed fact herd immunity possible now. became possible, I‚Äôve acknowledged fault variants likely unavoidable. let‚Äôs pretend wasn‚Äôt time prevention infection literally *the headline* mRNA vaccines. vaccinated still catch covid, chances experiencing severe disease lessened, chances dying miniscule. that‚Äôs plan, might well right? happen. work place canteen mask eating. kept distance, still possible. already contacted everybody around last two weeks. Yes, bow Lord Pfizer mean, percentage vaccinated people dying covid miniscule. get vaccine, fair say: ""you going die,""

Pretty good vaccine. What's problem having? Interesting, thanks sharing. seems like time vaccinated people catching it, unvaccinated people. Vaccinated vaccinated spread seems rare.  community pressure. Zoom school board meeting ""friends neighbors' people went high school 20 years ago said uncomfortable need find different profession. never felt gutted. Me. fully vaccinated fully vaccinated coworker lost sense smell. tested positive. working close proximity project day before, without masks (thanks, CDC). tested negative day also 5 days later. Yay, vaccines! case mild never caught her. Good Vermont.  Canadian here. family ignored ""not 100% effective"" aspect desperate over. provincial government pretty much told us took restrictions almost baby steps July 1st based % people one vaccine dose. Cases tanked early June. looked like over. definitely messaging vaccines 100% effective. moto press conferences literally ""The Best Alberta Summer Ever"". Pretty much every one know including thought / thinks vaccines solid shield clear now. youngest teenager going crushed turn true I'm reading .... shit.... MIL indication also get tested think test swabs sterilized method carcinogenic 10 seconds nostril time enough somehow cause cancer later. I‚Äôm sorry, Finland. suck sometimes. lot, lately. thing make easier mandate.  Unless idiots faith based insurance... probably we're back ""this affect fuck cares""? ... -.-
Seriously, already 'golden standard', 90% + efficacy disposal.

I'm still waiting jab since consoder Sinovac (the jab currently available live) unreliable amid news boosters, differential treatment, etc. mind taking supply ... could bout Covid last year, never forget HEADACHE. pervasive, never stops. Nothing take gets rid it. made want poke holes skull. bonus, 12 would highly protected severe infection death.

And less likely spread further, theory. damn good odds.

Oh irony there. That‚Äôs likely downvotes. Gonna need source 20 percent‚Ä¶ guess would decide. always multiple ways accomplish goal. Yeah probably blanks well absolutely go there, please wear properly fit N95 mask. free. went local grocery/pharmacy. proof insurance, payment- simply kind person helping safe. maybe base decisions science turn correct often not. know pretty crazy. preventing symptomatic disease don‚Äôt know yet  since last Tuesday notable jump cases area.  gun 12% chance backfiring, would shoot it? That's 1 8 bullets doesn‚Äôt matter, you‚Äôre fine  need protection weather surge coming (if already here). Even delta lethal, take chances regular ol' covid one dose. want wait, better ready complete shut-in next five weeks want make sure catch it, considering contagious delta is. Except lot innocent people, even vaccinated mask wearing die well think J&amp;J isn‚Äôt good enough? even get sick, gave fever caused inflammation body skyrocket 7/10 pain head lower back. back never hurt much life, even sleep it. ""You look thirsty. Here... please drink glass water.*

""YOU CAN'T TELL DO! BOSS ME!""

That's guys sound like. Makes sense. immunosuppressed people make antibodies virus. varies suppression regime. I'm immunosuppressed antibodies tested month fully vaccinated. happy find antibodies. still wear mask public socially distance. antibodies may effective average person due immunosuppressant. Medically sound, somewhat lacking bravado comparison. Lmao stupid comment. vaccine get?    got J&amp;J shot April, happy coverage Delta, simply signed local pharmacy get mRNA shot (Moderna local pharmacy had, basically Pfizer one). got 2 weeks ago, problems all. 

As felt safe getting shot that's technically recommended CDC, study released UK looked combination AstraZeneca Shot Pfizer shot. AstraZeneca shot uses near identical technology J&amp;J shot, study would good way predicting combining J&amp;J one mRNA vaccines. Anyways, demonstrated equivalent effectiveness double Pfizer shot regimen slight increased chance side effects like sore arm, fever, chills.

I felt ""risk"" worth peace mind better immunity. ""Loos says choice get COVID-19 vaccination fueled combination apathy optimism well would manage virus infected.
He also said wanted save dose made available healthcare workers vulnerable person.""


I'm gonna call man made medical school dumb, quite opposite. would consider smart man, made dumb choice.


Get shots folks. Covid prefers prey medical issues, mess up/outright kill healthy person.

Dr alive according article, well go read it.

Edit:

‚ÄúI‚Äôll always say it‚Äôs personal choice, right choice get vaccinated,‚Äù Loos advised We've effectively eradicated multiple diseases. covid takes people stupid.  Take measels example much infective covid, year 2000 stats: data clear, vax stop this, requires everyone.  else fails, follow instructions.  Finland maximizing vaccine coverage first shot delaying second. J&amp;J AZ vaccine incidents happened government really passive getting vaccines outside original quota EU. CDC observer pandemic. reacted slowly, always behind curve. There's way recover this.  Well damn. Glad ok that's disheartening sure. always stupid talking point going convince crowd needs to. Today complaints FDA approved, tomorrow it'll made bullshit. think realistically reason people think vaccine dangerous  Iceland [fully vaccinated 74% (not adults ""eligible"") dropped restrictions. we're seeing [a spike fair bit transmission vaccinated people.

So basically nobody completely safe. Serious question:

Why y‚Äôall think California consistently done worst ‚Äúserious states‚Äù?

They pretty bad spike last summer, catastrophic Winter surge 30,000+ cases per day December January, they‚Äôre midst another spike. dipshit proud admit vaccine right thing point. let vaccine everyone who's win. way how. hope drowns medical bills  Booster dose strong either Something know prevalent COVID animal reservoirs post-pandemic. know many cases human transfer various animal species. know right. feels sooo looong. 36% eff first shot isn‚Äôt reassuring. Schools requiring vaccination enrolled. Absolutely ridiculous isn't. least people right idea.

‚ÄúJust go on, cowboy up, go there, get shot, come like grown up."" It‚Äôs big deal get vaccinated

it reduces chance severe disease half. 
  [This showed COVID-19 cases vaccinated single dose either Pfizer-BioNTech AstraZeneca vaccines similar levels protection mortality single dose, 44% 55% respectively, compared unvaccinated 
 [..The data shows protection mortality Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine even higher ‚Äì around 69% ‚Äì confirmed cases second dose least 7 days prior positive 
 
^((these numbers bit lower Delta strain)^)  
 
The best part vaccines reduces chance contracting disease encounter virus. put enough, contract still decent chance getting hurt problem. Ugh doubtful. friend Pfizer got symptomatic cases Delta Covid Europe. We‚Äôre ok though can‚Äôt taste anything. high would want high enough make people safe time people realize infected seek medical care, significant damage already done body. Even could stop viral replication tracks, cure.  I‚Äôm referring UK delta while. Hospitalizations haven‚Äôt followed cases. reason think can‚Äôt fix stupid mom told better strategy. 3 months gives people immunity also better immunity long term (once get 2nd shot) shorter 2 week interval. seems like kind fiddling definition ""working"" last month two talk whether vaccines latest data Public Health England suggests delta variant, dominant UK, two doses vaccines available Britain estimated offer 79% protection symptomatic COVID 96% protection hospitalisation.

Not long ago, message seemed fully vaccinated, protected getting virus could go back life way 2019 safety. Fine open bars restaurants full capacity, travel heart's content. vaccinated, pandemic over!

Now, month two later, seem saying that, hundred people would gotten covid unvaccinated, 21 still develop symptomatic covid cases even *are* vaccinated. Using rule thumb half cases asymptomatic, another 20 get asymptomatic covid.

This substantial Improvement, nothing like hearing short time ago. need adjust expectations behaviors radically. Yea man that‚Äôs seems like people saying put mask it‚Äôs big deal going 2 years? 3 years? take step back compare risk vs reward fall going brutal elementary school outbreaks, especially states prohibiting mask mandates. mean, it‚Äôs understandable infuriated amount selfishness unvaccinated‚Ä¶ lead third wave delta could likely lead new variant emerging, essentially fucking us over. 

But wishing death someone something could never do, matter awful are. China says going make compulsory. central government even stopped local authorities requiring people get it. But, course, China, really make compulsory, send party representatives around houses people get tell going getting whether like not. Checked FAQ, see this: got J&amp;J vaccine news snippets I've seen say kinda sucks Delta variant.

Is news whether getting different shot point wait foreseeable future? 

(also possible I'm misinformed) thought Pfizer 2 weeks apart? Definitely would affect it. It‚Äôs similar, yet see single study Moderna higher percentages Pfizer. Even type study, Moderna somehow ends lower numbers, could bad luck even statistical error overlaps Pfizer‚Äôs numbers. talking moderna caused significantly immune responses patients, might actually turn good thing immune system mounting stronger response. would make sense getting two shots would give data immune cells, imagine would create better defense one. post exactly article talking about: think demonizing huge amount people going magically make join side instead galvanizing position? reach herd immunity eliminate virus, it'll keep spreading mutating, eventually rendering existing vaccines less effective, entirely useless.

The 30% consisting reluctant nutjobs going end killing us all. Think small sample size 4 people indicative anything. always known vaccinated people still get covid. much lower chance generally produces low symptoms non all. Effective delta variant. means effective delta variants? different deltas delta india worst one guess.. 88% effectiveness including indian variant cheers looked study methods (NEJM free), include immunocompromised people (who less likely protected vaccination), wonder even effective without outliers. Glad got second shot today.  Even prevent getting first place.

If falls hopefully make mild case, testable trials. efficacy number captures get infected, mild breakthrough cases.

But fail too. Vaccinated people still die, like soldiers body armor still get killed.

It's improving chances.

And collectively, virus finding hard circulate fully vaccinated population. Short answer, no. Long answer, Europe shown promising results clinical trials possible recommend phizer booster later. still young people keep vaping smoking drinking nothing Mountain Dew. would 100%. also got J&amp;J well serious symptoms/hospitalization, worried. 4 friends fully vaccinated J&amp;J got infected, mild flu-like symptoms 100% recovered 10 days later. That's fact jack reach herd immunity infection vaccination, one options breeds variants deadly symptoms. Covid dangerous flu needs better effectiveness % think clear answer courts rule. pandemic unique situation pre-pandemic rulings might control. said, see insurance industry much lobbying government changes. Correct. Nobody‚Äôs going follow this. could possibly hide? Ah ok! bad! 

I appreciate I‚Äôll ok.  Thank offer Yes, pretty close far know moment. dumbest fucking auto mod I‚Äôve ever seen hope omega variant like movie Get vaccine. Pfizer Moderna.

Only way stay safe indoors gatherings (if one waiting FDA approval next year vaccines), real, properly fitted N95 mask, 3M. Call 3M ask distributors.  recover quickly bro Advise = ""hell yea ain't gotta mask year!"" wasn‚Äôt snarky. actually extra buttons, I‚Äôd happy send one. Lots neat graphs article.

Pretty much fine though. 3 weeks New York State 2nd Pfizer.  believe option going 4 weeks. end end basically efficacy Pfizer they? 94/95% something like that? seem matter unless understanding... = NATO

Yes read original report. 

Although one guy clearly massive creep really either stupid impolite. 

Most harassment guards asking people phone number. even incredibly unprofessional retraining clearly need. 

I guess less guards likely low skilled low paid goons. Ok get it. trying avoid possible issues people thinking unvaccinated 

Lesson learned: one cares Employers ask employees vaccinated. cannot ask proof. 

This isn‚Äôt true all. It‚Äôs perfectly legal employers require vaccinations. They‚Äôve years pandemic. 3 weeks Switzerland it‚Äôs Moderna would doctor explain intubation him? man care things shoved throat. never actual lockdown one now, kind short fire break proposing work. Especially could easily reseeded.

Is it? simply attract willing aggressively seek money? Ah, go Walgreens? noticed website ask ‚ÄúHas patient received dose COVID-19 vaccination yet?‚Äù options ‚ÄúNo‚Äù ‚ÄúYes (Pfizer Moderna)‚Äù.

As J&amp;J recipient neither answer correct. almost like they‚Äôre giving us loophole purpose. 

Did ask person this, ask questions went there? ~2% deaths among vaccinated. 

This sad, could prevented vaccine passports employer/education vaccine mandates. (with x50 risk reduction vaccine, covid well line risks people take day, though).

But willing that, masking restrictions delay inevitable. unvaccinated adults made clear never going willing get vaccinated.

The way exponentials work means moment drop restrictions cases surge again.

That said, fully support mask mandates children vaccinated, mostly force unvaccinated mask up, unwilling vaccine requirements. children eligible (and given 6 weeks), mask mandates end. Exactly this, one thing comparing Sweden US, another entirely compare another Scandinavian country. remember Sweden's excess mortality 2020 7%, far better places like UK Spain (15-16% increased mortality) higher Scandinavian countries (I believe Norway around 0.2% Denmark Finland region 1-2%). 

Scandinavians generally healthier Europeans (longer life expectancy, lower levels obesity, outdoorsy/active hobbies) certainly given Sweden edge. Sweden also younger population countries. US UK following Swedish path would disastrous. Man really hope not. know someone long Covid it‚Äôs joke hard reconcile findings. Especially UK , Canada, Singapore done studies found similar results.

Singapore number look similar Israel. US tracking breakthroughs unless symptomatic real data infections post vaccination here. countries are

For fully vaccinated vs Delta:

Canada studies show 88% protection symptomatic infection - 

Scotland shown 79% infection - 

 Israel shows 39% infection - shows 69% infection - 

 land somewhere 39% 88% Right? like where‚Äôs difference?!  That‚Äôs exactly person you‚Äôre responding said though. agree. Bless hearts frontline workers deal patient. What's confusing? Get vaccinated, wear mask community transmission up. rocket science.

Beautiful statement Florida whole though: ""If parent Florida, would greatly concerning me.""

Yes. Yes would. always important wear masks inside outside... link original Israeli report? I've looked everywhere can't find it. know way long term effects vaccines long term effects Delta variant. based historical data vaccines vs historical data original covid 19 strain, long term effects catching delta likely far, far worse. (Mostly actually exist). multiple studies varying results.  Salaries across Europe jobs much flatter USA. Consumer prices particularly lower. fact salary structures flatter means choice profession less driven pay driven passion.

It naive view observed work. Start popping. use slide bar eliminate month want to. Deaths Virginia since June first amongst fully vaxxed   1) month people vaccinated last month.  time moves on, people vaccinated. Hence, waiting longer away masking superfluous action. 

2) terms masking, something better nothing. Especially people you‚Äôre around also masking. That‚Äôs great there‚Äôs fitted gold-standard N95, that‚Äôs reason throw away masks. 

This reminds recycling argument. bother? Much recycle gets burned anyways.  Okay, still gets reused. course compare *all* countries, tiny subset outliers. really know third shot needed. Personal opinion eventually we'll move yearly boosters far 2 dose regimen shown protective good amount time Probably not, models never historically done great job telling future pandemic. supposed see much longer larger wave last winter happen. Nope. countries wait get second dose.

Close 70% (68.3%) adult population United States received least one dose COVID-19 vaccine. progress represents marked achievement vaccinations led steep declines COVID-19 cases deaths, vaccination coverage‚Äîand protections provided it‚Äîremains uneven across country. growing spread transmissible Delta variant, cases, hospitalizations, deaths rising, largely among unvaccinated people. Persistently lower vaccination rates among Black Hispanic people compared White counterparts across states leave increased risk, particularly variant spreads.


Reaching high vaccination rates across individuals communities key achieving broad protection vaccine, mitigating disproportionate impacts virus people color, preventing widening racial health disparities going forward. Centers Disease Control Prevention (CDC) indicated vaccine equity important goal defined equity preferential access administration affected COVID-19.


The CDC reports demographic characteristics, including race/ethnicity, people receiving COVID-19 vaccinations national level. July 19, 2021, CDC reported race/ethnicity known 58% people received least one dose vaccine. Among group, nearly two thirds White (59%), 9% Black, 16% Hispanic, 6% Asian, 1% American Indian Alaska Native, &lt;1% Native Hawaiian Pacific Islander, 8% reported multiple race. However, CDC data also show recent vaccinations reaching larger shares Hispanic, Asian, Black populations compared overall vaccinations. Thirty percent vaccines administered past 14 days gone Hispanic people, 6% Asian people, 14% Black people (Figure 1). 




These recent patterns suggest narrowing racial gaps vaccinations national level, particularly Hispanic Black people, account larger share recent vaccinations compared share total population (30% vs. 17% 13% vs. 12%, respectively). ¬†While data provide helpful insights national level, date, CDC publicly reporting state-level data racial/ethnic composition people vaccinated. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Houston Texans - Detroit Lions SB according conspiracy theorist brother, posted day Facebook chart included acronyms. chart said 12,000 vaccinated people died COVID US *just last week*. trustworthy *real* news site called Gateway Pundit (actually, even GP, rando slapped GP logo chart- shared thousands times).

And chart, know true. anyone make chart acronyms official-sounding organizations. I‚Äôm disappointed Hopkins get 2 shots?  American scientists CDC finding ZERO loss efficacy 6 people [in study] vaccine longest, tells us lasts least 6 months,‚Äù added Bailey. ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs definitely longer ‚Äî it‚Äôs going drop 6 months. would concerned efficacy dropped third fact COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness remained almost unchanged span study period indication protection enduring. Hell yeah! guns, Twitter McDonald‚Äôs. 

/s Yes. county live free testing plan one day seven day ten. Oxford/public health england study also found longer gap first second doses better long term immune response.

So shorter gap need booster sure. People talking since pandemic started ""immunity escape"" ""vaccine escape"".

Could Delta dangerous ""lockdown escape"" variant? Look trouble Sydney Delta, similar (and indeed weaker) measures earlier variants would mopped-up outbreak five days, getting month they're still finding similar numbers per day.

Any ""lockdown"" say I'm referring whole suite NPIs, Wuhan/Sydney style reactions.

If wholesale behaviour change (which true vaccines, countries still vaccine hesitant) Survival Fittest means evolutionary pressure towards things make behaviour changes less effective. compare UK grading scale, anything 70% First Class degree anything 90% godly makes feel lot better. tested positive Wednesday despite phizer shots done March. I'm also runner worried feel, able ever get back shape. LA, anyone working set required get tested every single day. That's shitload people.

Others travel part certain activities. think might exposed. because. 

One friends getting tested twice week entire time. Where's good place buy authentic 3m Auras?  hope so. Fortunately vaccination campaign proceed earnest next Monday, starting inoculate people 50s, 19~49 age group. Longer gap means better long term protection. better waiting. mine 8 weeks UK. 3 week gap used rush testing get vaccine market quickly possible. 

In year two really glad 12 week gap. less contagious? unknown right now? Legit curious, 88% actually mean? think truly appreciate many people live County LA, let alone city. people connected entertainment industry. know call someone graduated bottom class med school?  

Doctor  validating ID 

What happens run id see J&amp;J? There's criminal civil penalty lying get vaccine right? There's even moral problem United States since tons extra vaccines.  government media publish every place every covid positive case been

If people know exposure site longer contact cases name shame.

This standard occasions happened widely criticised. example know name limo driver responsible current Sydney would never stand US.

They exactly robust contact tracing effort they? rest assured lot worse stands fine US. Like 600k dead Australia also banned citizens returning home basic human right,

Flight caps, specific. Primarily federal government lazy barely put minimum effort toward improving quarantine Australia cares little human rights

Don't know... death toll pandemic far pretty low compared countries think done relatively good job protecting right life. course people think government infringe human rights virus. Tell families millions dead around world free are.  look, UK tests 3 times many people per 100,000 Israel.

If anything UK picking asymptomatic cases Israel misses would also say good maintaining relationships (and sanity) ,as crazy friends gotten (live friend family anti vax) still people , love hearts,they hugely mislead.If friend accident got injured leave them, same.It's tough really believe ""right"" opinion ones able put egos one side try connect folk,not try convince make feel safe accepted enough question beliefs without fear us jumping throat ,if humanity remains divided doomed.And yes truly hard reasonable face insanity believe try. wonder people pull phrases like ass happier. 
Being fully vaccinated mean cannot catch virus develop Covid, still totally can, significantly reduces risk disease becoming life-threatening. Wearing masks becomes unnecessary group immunity achieved, places far reaching kind level vaccination. best everyone, even vaccinated people, wear masks. 
If gonna say something confidence, least make sure correct. got first shot today second one scheduled 3 weeks. Already asked day work know reschedule asymptomatic, getting tested? due occupations, came contact someone sick? people remain reluctant get vaccinated (ie giving virus time mutate), short time. most, **many**.

Definitely enough people significant effect testing results. Canada also massive outbreaks nursing homes particularly vulnerable people (dementia etc.). vulnerable people 80+ likely get covid nursing home (compared someone 80+ relatively healthy), maybe would drive IFR? sure that's case worth keeping mind. Wow ""we live society"" used unironically?
 serious business üòé idea study referring to. might actually get take slight mutations too. come along 1 leave 5. Everyone's winner! true Apocalympics

Create Olympic COVID variant memento. Right - mean, like viruses ""thinking"" - they're little replication factories: extremely basic forms ""life"" (which some, rightly so, debate they're even ""alive"" all), nothing close mind, protein coat receptor-matching spikes, short sequence DNA RNA.

So, mutation could occur potentially even higher transmissibility, per Delta, also perhaps even longer latency infection symptoms, far deadly, like virus would ""care"" even know this. would keep blindly replicating spreading onto next person replicate more, literally unknowingly killing hosts great numbers. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

However, seeing response decent chunk humanity COVID vaccine, *obvious* manmade climate change, use social media spread medieval superstition mob mentality, aging nuclear arsenals false alarm could easily lead partial full-exchange (it's literally come one person already) thinking we've got great possibility extinct whole lot sooner people think. 

Just idiocy anti-COVID-vax ""COVID hoax"" crowd, really hammers home greatest existential threat *my species.*  Delta, things changed, that‚Äôs nobody‚Äôs fault. let‚Äôs pretend definition vaccine success hasn‚Äôt shifted.

Except hasn't. Even vaccines *ever* 88% effective they'd still given emergency authorization. ~7% difference really game changer terms successful vaccines are, we've always known risk variants would change things (and that's still true). I‚Äôm inclined agree you, ff7 remake series isn‚Äôt finished yet so‚Ä¶. Interestingly enough hear thing drug dealers.  ‚ÄúThose guys dumb, won‚Äôt get caught.‚Äù Tons smart people prison.  Oh definitely. I‚Äôm baffled fact think pointing efficacy 95% somewhere 60-70s horrendous crime honesty. It‚Äôs fact. vaccines worse infection, thus main focus constantly justifying preventing hospitalization death - do, well, ability prevent infection provide herd immunity touted (no matter much pretend wasn‚Äôt) swept rug. Sounds like you‚Äôre trying revive tired fiction Covid deaths flu deaths easily disproven handful seconds research. Thank you! Yeah can't rely individuals make correct decision 100% time.

There's always get stuck wrong conclusion somehow.

They made obligatory medical personnel everywhere (and even cleaning staff hospitals). Thank clarification links! Homepage PITCH: paper: close, no, better ventilation outside. feel everyday think shifted 8 weeks, least Helsinki. I'm way second shot right now! much, much lower rate. expecting 100% misled. Surprise surprise‚Ä¶ Yeah infuriating. even gall find excuse said ""I wanted save shot people needed it"" 

The whole point prevent doctors giving patients taking bed meant patient.

I numbers US UK hospital infections shamefully go hospital get better. rely hospitals. What's point hospitals chances get covid die broke leg?  Neither statements true. ironically follow his/her logic truthful, posting Reddit agreeing makes popular narrative therefore not-truthful

Making statement incorrect.

ü§™ü§™

But mindfucks aside, agree Cases accurate representation actual infections, especially case India low test rate time peak many densely populated areas plain old covid spread extremely rapidly, thus testing system becomes overwhelmed quite easily. instance, testing swine flu era good representation whether virus exponentially spreading dying down. (or CDC, can‚Äôt remember) estimated around 200,000% infections confirmed cases (in US). Swine flu strains infected estimated 5b people since inception (09). Delta lot infectious that, covid testing rates lot higher. 

Still, ignoring testing rates, think it‚Äôs reasonable assume virus running course, worst India, worst country 1.4b people would be, well‚Ä¶ lot infections.  Im curious something: 

Do th√© vaccin√© effect affect Delta variant much th√© previous variants? 
If not, th√© diff√©rence  also never got flu shot...until got flu age 24 wanted die. week. 

The flu ripped though everyone work years back. people solid week, little sniffly day. one strains ""wasn't covered"" flu shot year. think inside outside mean?  Swedish governmental recommendations proper use masks look here: refuse giving assholes like service? hes going selfish refuse part, fuck taxpayers insurance companies cover bill. least make pay everything hes going asshole. curious, side effects vaccines? believe virus contained mainly upper respiratory tract breakthrough cases. body efficiently fighting off, chance spread. Yeah whatever side effects vaccines have, covid-19 thousand times worse.

Keep pushing vaccine risk losing her. sound healthy enough shake covid-19.

Forbid contact son goes school might help convince her. Sounds like whats happening me, never ""flu"" bad. Double vaxxed going get tested today. Happily double pfizered here. 

In leyman""s terms study says keep vaccinating 2nd dose Pfizer get ready 3rd shot, masses. 

Uncle Pfizer eyes goes ka-ching! $$$. 

You think... okay I'm going fine 3rd shotv that's good realize fricken zeta variant study comes suggesting 3-time pfizered 8x% safe.... Pfizer 4th dose already work. üëèüëèüëå fuck ill inhale variants prove morons shit fake CCP propaganda  read news lot things ‚Äúappear‚Äù next day change completely. cares? like going change anything. highly doubt majority unvaccinated waiting approved. 12 shots O_O? 88%. That's, uncomfortably low. like UK scale better! 

(I also cheeky saying B+ , I‚Äôm huge proponent mRNA vaccines). way u actually believe elimination valid strategy. maybe valid January 2020 point since. 

See commenter said. Look favelas Brazil slums India, it‚Äôs west would need eliminate it‚Äôs world, countries can‚Äôt afford months intense restrictions potential couple cases sending back square zero. Never going happen, worked Sars mers contagious virus stay NZ accept covid country eventually.

Also, Taiwan Singapore haven‚Äôt eliminate virus, they‚Äôve simply suppressed it. Sweden done great job vaccinating elderly risk mine tomorrow, unusually short interval, 20 days.

While bit pity dosing interval apparently quite suboptimal, Delta rampant country guess may one situations perfect enemy good. Waiting 36 days (not choice matter, choose dates, hypothetical case did) would substantial chance catching virus single-jabbed. ""Facebook Misinformation Virus"" infectious one dose interval increased many places due lack supply, people could get first dose fast possible. Canada bought plenty doses arriving great numbers, plenty supply. Thus easier reschedule Canada places. wife Pfizer still got contracted virus . Moderna never got never get that. even possible? know, kidding cheeky. I‚Äôm huge proponent mRNA vaccines, conversations people day arguing them. Work ER. covid testing done front. nurse running covid testing says they're seeing positive covid tests vaccinated people live someone got covid. typically arent sick people testing positive unvaccinated They're currently looking third shot later line. Also considered there? None vaccines thus far achieve **sterilizing immunity**, would entirely prevent becoming infected virus. Instead, get **effective immunity** means virus infect you, immune system quickly recognizes eliminates virus take hold develop severe disease.

During time infected, -- least theory -- spread others. health authorities wanted fully vaccinated people still wear mask first. However, studies since shown chances transmission low, mask recommendation lifted. revenue may play role also question trials production capacity both
 lead times. French Guiana South America, Africa. No. anti-vaxx crowd. 

We plenty people putting evolutionary pressure intelligence seems acceptable. 

I tried, truly cannot summon sympathy people begging vaccinations ER believed hoax. Mind language!

if 4 million died instead 400k, means number infected also much higher. 

At point considerable percentage population must it. least half people must delta variant many died.

That means virus ran people infect many areas India. Mucosal immunity.. ‚ÄúYou unimaginable vaxxer.‚Äù Glad hear that. Getting 2nd dose pfizer today. 
Another months I'll able take mask maybe  Grand Old Pandemic bright side super duper immune. first pfizer shot may follow second shot..I thinking getting second dose delta variant news. late get second dose?

First said need wear mask,even advising it. said healthy people need wear mask (despite fact could catch covid pass unhealthy people). said use N95 masks (the ones effective) health care workers need them. said old piece cloth mask. 

For months told us wash hands. least 20 seconds many times per day. said virus easily passed surface contact. told us months maintain 6 feet social distance virus travel far air. said 3 feet good enough. 

The CDC says get vaccine completely ignores natural immunity covid survivors (which one study said 7 times stronger vaccinated people). CDC says vaccinated people need wear mask 10,000 cases 46 states vaccinated people getting covid CVDC remains silent covid survivors required wear masks.

The vaccines targeting spike protein. Moderna Pfizer vaccines consist mRNA encodes spike protein SARS-CoV-2 encapsulated lipid nanoparticles. difference two mRNA vaccines dosage potentially composition lipid nanoparticles used deliver mRNA cells. inside cells, cells re-creates modified version spike protein elicit immune response. Yeah fortunately ""should similar"" way science conducted. Studies must done. literally wrong. literally fast tracking. making excuses treating like children. Poli vaccine measles tested decades people still anti vaccine. Stop making excuses  been. Yes least Toronto ton Pfizer first ton Moderna later. government said get whatever‚Äôs available. got Pfizer + Moderna. trying here. cool friend. Thanks source! Question non doctor: possible antibodies vanish months t-cells remember reason start see less protection symptoms hospitalization? body takes time build antibodies (as moment infection present anymore) get symptoms body manage get rid infection end hospital, basically slower response, still good response. know aren‚Äôt sizeable portion? tracking vaccinated vs unvaccinated‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. don‚Äôt think creating third subgroup previous Covid vaccine Texas love too!

Not much love putting idiot antivaxx trash posters place, though. *The¬†most commonly reported symptoms¬†in people doses headache, runny nose, sneezing, sore throat loss smell.*

Those symptoms mild respiratory infection. seen lot reports long covid vaccinated people number age distribution deaths comparable good old flu.

We lock everything flu.

This subject change data comes in, far see reason ""need rethink lives"" on. backwards! governor moron, I'm glad we're ignoring him. didn‚Äôt wait. J&amp;J March, got Pfizer shots. far good. Yeah no. I‚Äôm wearing mask anymore period. parents dead mid 40s covid, I‚Äôm mid 20‚Äôs. don‚Äôt give two shits even one shit people point either. parents send kids masked, kids (I teach high school) hear bullies say kids scaredy cats ‚Äúliberals‚Äù. even got backlash teachers last year wearing mask.

One friends told daughter knew importance wearing mask, would wear everyday. tell friend daughter took mask immediately arriving school.  I'm vaccinated wearing mask. wear one inside grocery stores public transportation, I'm ok that, something I'll probably going forward.
But, agree people need contribute too. I'm waiting see vaxx numbers children able get shots. telling. 7 10 fully vaxxed Texas Democrats flew DC without masks got COVID, somehow supposed believe it‚Äôs rare?

‚ÄúPay attention man behind curtain!!!‚Äù headline sure look great, anyone happen read study methodology?

Spoken like someone abuses teachers... literally clue. Looks like vaccination rate (among 16+ year olds) LA county 70%. means ratio vaccinated people unvaccinated people 2:1. 30% unvaccinated. 2X many potential hosts fully vaccinated. Considering that, also considering vaccinated generally mild symptoms, seem alarming.  serious issues Israel‚Äôs data. continue push numbers without publishing accompanying data sets.

If vaxxed basically safe. Life goes on. thought trusting science, no? also made covid tests *not free* (neg. tests required entries). vaccine hesitant would pay covid tests pretty much every week. multiply 6-12 months hundreds thousands euros. Covid

I‚Äôm still unsure something. 88% still catch Covid asymptotic? so, system fighting successfully? still pass others? so, how? second shot made feel like crap. can't imagine get root canal could barely get bed. could schedule like 4-5 days later, would safer, case second shot makes feel sick.

As far vaccine would impact ability heal, doubt it, could ask doctor unsure.  What's bad news J&amp;J?

Personally, go walk outside, wear mask. try walk around people. going wear mask going somewhere crowd.

In words, we're quite happy 17% athletes going super spreaders infecting even US citizens deadly disease return home. Demand first doses seems reached countries though. Exactly. remember heated debate whether sterilizing immunity could reasonably expected. Turned significant early on, combine (expected normal) waning antibodies transmissible variant gets knocked couple pegs. timeline maybe got pushed forward months this, always endgame (with boosters probably recommended least least while).

(And assumes Israel‚Äôs methodology point, still pretty big if) person fully vaccinated Moderna  I‚Äôm pretty scared. Since got vaccines ago don‚Äôt know well I‚Äôm protected. Low key information tangled politics it‚Äôs making nervous. think important thing vaccinated people aware infect others. Lots people running around thinking literally immune.

I also think deaths, rare, worrisome lot people. Yeah, can't always prevent death, one thing list awful things might randomly get people got damn vaccine maybe could stop thinking it. True, PR disaster IOC best.  Cases UK seem declining excess death compared last year especially. Deaths US remained relatively low well even ‚Äúsurges‚Äù.

Humans always stupid. COVID showing us idiot Oz behind curtain. DONT TAUNT VIRUS.

THIS GET ANGRY VARIANT OP talking confirmed Delta cases. would countries outside small set vaccines readily available manage? even ones still restricted age group. curious reaction world cases continuously drop abrupt reopening   European countries insulting, really. We're asked come one day week. things I've 70 weeks straight home problem. I'm actively looking work. mean misdiagnosed? Yet, anyway. I'm Maryland too. county five new cases couple days ago, 17 new ones yesterday.

Be careful there. Answer: would attract cream crop can‚Äôt immune response unless infected. immune system shield penetrated, cant mount response disease don‚Äôt have.\*

This means odds catching COVID entirely behaviour, immune system.

The hope vaccinations etc immune system mount faster response infected. response fast accurate, won‚Äôt feel symptoms. prepared response (I.e. first exposure) immune system work out, process causing symptoms may quite severe.

So 88% effective meaningful, indicates population vaccinated 88% less likely become ill, point vaccination.

This mean exposure 12% chance get COVID. end, mean 88% chance never get COVID, regardless many exposures had. would statistically challenging calculate probabilities.

In 88% case, infected virus start replicate respiratory system. days, virus present high enough concentrations may trigger positive test, you‚Äôre immune system detect it. triggers targeted antibody response, using existing antibodies new ones T-cells. virus rapidly dispensed with, without causing symptoms. Remember symptoms caused immune response, virus itself. you, potential upside immune system challenged, immunity probably improved. 

The number quoted vaccines effectiveness preventing severe COVID. number calculated based significantly positive infections (based antigen concentration), excludes asymptomatic cases. means preconditions commute - vaccine 88% protection symptoms, 97% preventing hospitalisation, 99.996% less likely hospitalised.

No sources hand based discussions GF (MD &amp; PhD, researching immunologist UCL), mom (PhD immunology, currently near top UK gov).

South Korean suggested Korean brands me, comfortable. careful counterfeits. data get doses, chances becoming long hauler? definitely favor people getting shots, say 102.3 fever second shot (and that's baseline 97.5). fun, unlike COVID itself, lasted day. Canadian data breakthrough infections among receiving second shot 6 weeks doesn‚Äôt exist yet. make sense, ""40%"" denominator.  recommending offering third dose/booster Pfizer U.S. yet? 2nd shot back early February, worried kids young vaccine home. sore arm first shot. Second shot noticeable. chills like half day. effects went away really quickly though. shots Moderna That's big part it. Telling people get sick they're vaccinated rubbish. need keep reporting breakthrough statistics, especially they're going anything else. People need informed. That's completely true. CDC tracking breakthrough cases (infection full vaccination) result hospitalization. roommate going chemotherapy. Work wants back I‚Äôm worried might track home despite vaccinated. Yup, Covid felt like cold me, still can't smell certain stuff 9 months getting infected. Glad know. Considering one dose vaccine protective delta, find suspicious. seems UK government picking studies retroactively supporting policies.  Also asymptomatic people aren‚Äôt coughing sneezing place less viral load begin with, expelling less normal Covid infected person. going wish crossed line worse variant shows up, likely will. # Summary:

The study done people fully vaccinated BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine.

Between dates: June 20 - July 17, 2021

Results:

Protection asymptomatic infection = 39%

Protection mild disease = 40%

Protection hospitalization = 88%

Protection severe disease = 91% understand employers saying can't anymore. worked hospital fire department, stay current vaccinations lose job. Tuberculosis way less common covid now, still prove infected it. Suddenly, can't enforce laws level. insanity. Great point, though curious split behavior would two camps unvaccinated people. definitely unvaccinated overly cautious fact. Shoot almost got üòÇ Also seems based prior exposure, no?

I'm curious ends tomorrow. far know, never caught covid, I'm guy. Hoping easy time it. efficacy stats, would mean

* 88/100 = symptoms
* 12/100 = symptoms hospitalization
* 0/100 = symptoms hospitalization (or worse) yet epidemiological/public health standpoint:

*It would slow spread.* That's nuts. Like Switzerland everybody choose date want get vaccine 4 weeks get second shot. I‚Äôm curious, idea how? still wear mask? 2 shots ~~tequila~~ Moderna? Mmmmmm guess he's still waiting bill. true, though. anthrax Ebola outbreak, course federal government would take harsher steps protect public. Quarantines mask requirements around since colonies. 

Also, Democratic states uniformly well. live CA, overall vaccination rate 60%. However, many red inland counties horrible vaccination rates. town 19%. might well live fucking Alabama. Honestly I'd think targeting hot spots help much. time identified hot spot late help short term. restriction abundance caution goes along hot spot helped short term. time priority vaccines would help pretty much end vaccine roll out.  Well info would really helpful 6 months ago... Hopefully. can't nice things. studies concluding 3 months shots might actually better 3 weeks. developing country point view means apply doses get without saving much(half doses basically) reach people faster. one shot worst 2? Definetly! one better 0 3 months pass get boosted response (it seems) risky small demographic benefit(reach people faster) short term daium good one long term(assumed better response) D‚Äôoh! I'm sure health insurance companies add distinction. planet on? you‚Äôre vaccinated, things still relatively normal fast I‚Äôm concerned. Wear mask higher risk situations live life also interesting data well. Obviously small sample size preliminary nothing write stone. interesting none less. Simple: they're lying getting it. saline, never pushed plunger. doctors sign paperwork.

If believe everything lie, justify anything. vaccines, it‚Äôs ok get one. think doubled tdap accident, told doc wasn‚Äôt worried it. don‚Äôt know whether mRNA vaccines different. Others reported problems doubling up. think best thing ask doctor question tired Reuters making news headlines pretending scientific consensus, without even courtesy link study.

What kind news room running? hate say upon reviewing article seem correct, assuming ct values refers viral load

I'm gonna read papers update comments accordingly know people downvoting this. exactly right. setting conditions worse variants also setting legal societal precedents worse virus arise.

That's ocd talking. difference efficacy terms real world numbers almost negligible. can't make peace it, go get mrna vaccines. They're free everywhere. Yo duuuude. wrong ideas vaccines Camp Pontiac 550 campers campus; half 7 11 years old, half 12 17, according campers 12 older tested positive Covid-19, four vaccinated, said. 275 staff camp fewer 10 vaccinated, added. I'm buddy, GUY! understanding Phizer lower ‚Äúviral load‚Äù something like doesn‚Äôt give reaction. Moderna stronger needs makes sense. I‚Äôm really giving bad explanation it‚Äôs reason people worse reaction second Moderna shot. twitter erased 3 adults household phizer vaccinated covid positive. 1 moderna adult gotten sick. breathe 100,000,000 viruses day. Don‚Äôt worry much asymptomatic follow science. Vaccinated people need wear masks situations. saying ignored science anti-vax people would stop wearing masks one would check proof vaccination. Exactly type political calculations made dissuading people go get masks early on. lost city Atlantis actually New Zeland - pandemic free utopia dream of. too. fully vaccinated since April. vaccination rate idiot town 19%. covid variant petri dish. I'm worried getting infected even I'm wearing mask. emergency dental procedure done two appointments, obviously can't wear mask. absolute burden society. Delta crazy infectious, vaccines force field prevent infections, rather body knows covid really good fighting off. vaccinated people get Covid hospitalized even fewer die. someone 65, normal death rate unvaccinated people like 0.01% lower (1 1000 1 100000 younger people), vaccinated adds one two zeroes that. True read (in New Scientist usually pretty reliable) herd immunity ever actually achieved vaccines. Immune response natural infection varies lot. True accounts. always knew large portion Americans idiots last 4 years highlighted bad problem is. highly effective serious illness/hospitalisation. get delta vaccination, much milder symptoms probably hospitalised. going every year until.. know side effects ventilators longtime used ? Apart ‚Äúwho‚Äôs going pay brat attitude‚Äù, nuts? Well, said reply post, I've success opposite approach. nice got nowhere, going nuclear saw friend get ass vaccinated. 

So think us need remember there's one approach works everyone. 

As aside, I'm glad talked mother around vaccinated. Well gov't also prioritized delta hotspots.. Ontario anyways. Living GTA felt like vaccines available anyone everyone last couple months. areas BC, still 8 week span doses. 

I hope we're going see rise cases coming months happening UK. US won‚Äôt ever go hard lockdown again. Certain counties/cities may create mandates hard lockdown won‚Äôt happen regardless happens. Might fall boosters. Might donate countries. Might kids 12 get vaccine green light sometime late Q3-Q4. Maybe above? Luckily 90% people 65 least 1 dose, 80% fully vaccinated. don‚Äôt think ever reach number deaths previous spikes numbers. Wait.... people chose vaccinate wearing masks, might STILL choose vaccinate start wearing masks? 

So slow rate infections protect idiots exact thing either way? Oh no, another model predicting 

there actually 4 HUGE numbers 

Which one thought huge? Hey, I'm hopeful go well. would honestly really encouraging me. just... I've also seen videos huge crowds tunnels Olympics many constantly pull masks I'm still nervous. Never underestimate power dummies ruin everything. thought ‚Äúprobably won‚Äôt die‚Äù outcome caught covid.

Over 600k Americans vastly globally would disagree you. Well, is, would die covid WA state delta currently out-competing gamma (we've gamma since March) gamma greater proportion hospitalizations vaccine breakthrough cases far. isn‚Äôt happening time remotely soon end suffering consequences, might regret it. They're dumb make right decision, many dumb regret making wrong one mean, confident mask *mandates* even effective first place?

Even masks work (and help, silver bullet), you‚Äôre counting 1) high compliance 2) masks areas transmission frequently occurs. Count skeptical people still eat (maskless) indoors, large maskless private gatherings 18 month old. pediatrician said mask (we never stopped). I've seen kids 12 go stores mask. hoping would done son turns 2 didnt fight wearing mask. trying normalize already, thinks game. We've focusing treatments moment pandemic began. problem is, time somebody ends hospital, there's already massive damage that's done.

I really get impression lot people view ""once over"" angle. **Covid never over**. Every year new mutations come us. name game always been, start, push mortality back level general society comfortable with. Fucking idiots. Chronic illnesses suck, lot people suffer would absolutely rather dead. quality life lesser. might sound like huge deal live months years sound like mild symptoms, reality actually experiencing different right, American team field anyone vaccinated. Per Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) used collect reports adverse events vaccination general public. primarily used identify potential topics investigate regards vaccine reactions.

That necessarily translate peak underlying health. fact, many athletes state chronic overtraining disguised PEDs. (They're PEDs, let's clear up).

Initially focused vaccines I‚Äôm glad did. I‚Äôd like focus treatments really signal moving back pre Covid normal lifestyles. point, though, don‚Äôt really care unvaccinated wear mask ‚Äî least enough mandate everyone. should, yes, they‚Äôre mostly danger folks unvaccinated.

Right. Back every corner world. stewing viral village 3 weeks carry anything caught, like maybe Delta variant, back thier home countries. Every, home country.

It fucking insane hold Olympics right now. Consider also many unvaccinated likely covid. difficult compare vaxx previous infection. Oh god. I‚Äôm even going argue ridiculous comment know masks affect eyes. you‚Äôre vaccinated, can‚Äôt get tested see you‚Äôve covid past vaccine antibodies present.

I problem that. then, I‚Äôm Olympic athlete.  Hey anybody notice yellow strobe lights turning corners US. 

Wonder indicates possible concern.

No business usual still get vaccine wear mask betterment society slow thing down.

I guess find like living 1890s then.

Sorta feels like pointless stage. idea else except write off.  need wear mouth nose, eyes lol  think remote learning fine (though takes buy help parents mostly want offload kids free babysitter).

I assure remote learning fine. inferior many kids downright ineffective. expect kid first grade get education tablet compared got vaccinated. likelihood contributing spread roughly mask not.

It absolutely not. still reasonable chance contracting virus asymptomatically spreading it. Two doses Pfizer 88% effective Delta. 12% chance still decent  So-called Christians. Something seemed last weeks. don‚Äôt want get there, whole series events odd. day half worth cases, total, since probably February. Employers mandate vaccine even emergency authorization. Nothing prevents many have. Good you! Florida reports data weekly 97% Nepalese want vaccinated. Australia failing going hard enough early enough - yes absolutely.

Elimination eradication. years time, current data showing cognitive limitations complications Long Covid anything concerend - I'll happily support live conclusion. 

Until point, progressive elimination strategy achieves health goals, economic goals personal freedom goals.  Activision working time last couple years apparently. simply untrue. Good. Goodgoodgood. fantastic. 

America #1 anti-vaccination hysteria conspiracy theory. people afraid export anything anymore. concern would blame Biden somehow. hope waste resources sending more, can't imagine anyone wanted vaccine still got one there. 

Sorry sorry. CDC said vaccinated people wear masks. intended carrot get people go get vaccines.

Instead anti-vax people decided meant could stop wearing masks lie. sure would make difficult breathe reduce effectiveness but‚Ä¶maybe black spray paint don‚Äôt find luck?  people reprimanded vaccine outreach Tennessee get consequences erased, right? politicians certainly do. followers believe polls skewed favor. friend mine informed 11 people sons daycare tested positive Covid, 7 children. 

Things looking really great next school year /s.   extremely high vaccination rate however shared spaces (like public transit) still high mask usage. another mask mandate put place people grumble, abide correct regarding recent study(ies). still really darn close.

I mean, guess must think something like else would make switch. seems like another weird move weird month Israeli moves. worst moderna same, like, seems like F U Pfizer given context ‚Äúdeal‚Äù they‚Äôve going since December. Yeah man train 5 hours day, eat super healthy even manage caloric intake exactly. Vaccine? Nah, I‚Äôd rather die preventable disease. Infection rate 1 1 symptomatic infection.

You‚Äôre welcome. you‚Äôve already J&amp;J, go back also get Pfizer/Moderna? different never said want kids school. think remote learning fine (though takes buy help parents mostly want offload kids free babysitter). 

I got vaccinated. likelihood contributing spread roughly mask not. difference would negligible, pass. That's good. caused serious eye issues. rush doctor panic spend lot money learn didn‚Äôt eye infection, corneas extremely dry damn masks. definitely 100% 5-6 days shot. got J&amp;J. sensitive stomach issues I‚Äôm fairly certain issue food ate day got shot made things much worse would normally though. wife got J&amp;J time also didn‚Äôt feel good back 100% 3 days Fortunately, misunderstood, that's date legally finish take anything else account priority difficulty task. know one person needed shit ton paperwork proof vaccination two negative test within 72 hours. sounds like US/athlete favoritism. Really bizarre I'm assuming Japanese authorities want start international incident. ashamed US. people get vaccinated *because* they're selfish.  donut comes free sprinkles I'm pretty sure means 100 people would severe illness covid, 9 that. eyes, severe illness really means severe - 'mild' infection still rock socks off. Asymptomatic vaccinated people transmit disease. Please spread misinformation. ""recommend"" wearing masks indoors Colorado. recommendation never stopped. requirement however. HUGE difference.

I telling you, ""requirement"" happen here. governor aggressive getting away mandates. Colorado much Washington. chose live here.

We point large stadium events full capacity here. personally follow recommendations laws. However, CDC balance telling people vax safe effective bringing back masks.

Those us happy get vac see masks nbd continue on. people need reach vax see validation actually work. Precisely. watch nieces nephew time time (like right now) young vaccine. yeah, catch it, maybe fine. Probably even. died something... would really hard time living myself. nonchalant attitude see often makes lose whatever tiny faith left humanity. fact ever mistake make again. hugs... hang there. got sticky wicket navigate there. agree, protecting 12s huge gap beginning school year going rough ride think. given political climate US (and I'm assuming USian) actually sort precaution 12s unlikely lot school districts country. like we've gone collectively mad. One dead athlete Covid entire Olympics regarded biggest mistake history Olympics. 

IT impact Olympics going forward. 

Given sexcapades attractive, athletic, sexual prime athletes get to. 

100% see least one death Covid Olympics. Might interesting look shareholders behind companies. projection be? Exactly. widely distributed *test* vaccine history world.  USA enough vaccines get vaccinated. Pity athletes probably antivacers.  especially vaccine available anyone wants one.

That's true - many children still unable get vaccine COVID. I've seen reports true 12 least""mid winter"". Covid killed around 300 kids USA since start pandemic, flu killed 180 2019-2020 year. Covid far deadlier compared flu. mask measures place, mortality figure kids could significantly higher. care happens everybody. 

What impossibly burdensome exhausting way live. parents never tell ‚Äúdon‚Äôt worry everyone else focus yourself‚Äù? one deserves die covid

Why don‚Äôt attitude towards causes death? going micromanage everyone‚Äôs lives they‚Äôre safe? realize crazy sound right now? even tried explain behavior 2019 you, you‚Äôd tell I‚Äôm insane. Billions still unable access vaccine.

I'm baffled number people still think *global pandemic* best understood terms what's going outside window. Wait what‚Ä¶ allow unvaccinated athletes olympics? Really got downvotes making realistic question (a bit dramatically). Yeah exceptions special needs students can‚Äôt.  Guess stay masked away people whose status know.

No.

Why assholes want kids school assholes refuse anything help keep cases safer kids school?

You wear piece fabric face public kids safer starting school year? Why? Talk shit one vaccine switch another works almost exactly same. 
Looks like personal interest companies behind them. can‚Äôt believe people still defending elimination strategy point. Elimination happening. Australia failing miserably it. people should‚Äôve gotten vaccinated. It‚Äôs since Wait Two Weeks certainly mean 0% chance getting it

My question many people vaccinated got Delta virus? question, trying make waves. Add Japan struggles even vaccinate people. don‚Äôt free vaccines give willy nilly. Yeah, don‚Äôt think read erectile disfunction side effect either. probably pretty reasonable.

With decreased antibody titer would necessarily mean vaccine work means time lag fight post exposure. 

As body stored memory cells antibodies make them.

The relative strength mix antibodies Effectiveness towards Delta depends individual immune system.  Walmart often little substores store offer services like optometry. little medical clinic probably uncommon. Omg. That's ethical dilemma tension. 

Doing something objectively beneficial someone get greater benefit wrong.

Plus US spends billion dollars foreign aid fight malaria HIV.  catch covid probably won‚Äôt die‚Ä¶ sub living bizarre world CFR covid 50%+ takes half year vaccine become essentially worthless? That's really encouraging vaccines (not Pfizer), gonna need booster twice year... cannot even fully vaccinate people shortages/slow rollout/anti-vaxxers/etc.

What countries applied Pfizer time Israel (January)? think US CDC reason trying hide real-world efficacy data vaccines US ending testing among vaccinated people. need data. Studies need done, nobody knows yet That‚Äôs interesting. got second moderna dose couple weeks first.  Wish data Vaccinated people likely high risk groups, vaccinated people may less likely get tested. mean measured mortality rate overstated vaccinated people. Huh. I‚Äôm sick exact symptoms right now, fully vaccinated moderna :/ That's definitely issue BOE, I'd probably vote pick one set guidelines stick it. absolutely unacceptable compete without vaccine  nah. 74 million * T* ~22% population.

I mean, would killing really _less_ work v*ting? per reports overall percentage US percentage. countries (like India) 100% vaccination. Def stereotype tho

He says running meth lab house lawn 3 rusted cars barely functional Ford Taurus :P  addition things, important remember continued growth unsustainable going peak sooner later anyway - question when.  don‚Äôt agree 100% op said many ways he‚Äôs right. virus endemic now, window herd immunity closed months ago, frankly bit pipe dream given majority world remains unvaccinated. Even reached 70%+ vaccinated would still spread amongst ourselves, less deadly consequences. unvaccinated also ones spreading virus, though typically viral load someone who‚Äôs unvaccinated could infect someone. reality Covid-19 going away point future, probably contract it. vaccinations evolution virus hopefully follows corona viruses, become less deadly we‚Äôll learn live - honestly won‚Äôt choice. you‚Äôre going see breakthrough cases vaccinated people variant robust replicates fast, get really sick feel like crap couple days, all, move forward. Almost need aid hospital worse, die. Though it‚Äôs difficult see last year half, winning, admittedly long way go. vaccine preventing this? admire compassion perhaps you‚Äôre right. massive moral hazard problem bugs me. Many people really reckless health rest us pay price. ELI5 performed cognitive testing large number people UK, split people different groups - COVID negative, suspected COVID, confirmed COVID, hospitalized COVID, etc. examined cognitive performance differences two groups found even mild COVID groups showed lower scores. thing keep mind ‚Äúsignificant‚Äù statistical word means something mathematical, necessarily ‚Äúsignificant‚Äù way mean everyday life say ‚Äúyou significantly smarter me‚Äù. effect size found someone ill without respiratory problems 0.04 SD, ill respiratory symptoms without needing medical assistance 0.07 remained home (i.e., without inpatient support) showed small statistically significant global performance deficits (assisted home respiratory difficulty ‚àí0.13 SD N = 173; medical assistance respiratory difficulty ‚àí0.07 SDs N = 3,386; ill without respiratory difficulty ‚àí0.04 SDs N = 8,938).

As far understand reading it, would correspond roughly 1 IQ point even 0.5 IQ points used IQ scale intelligence. I‚Äôm sure really used push idea mild COVID causing people significantly impaired Also, dont know breakthrough infections mean wrt long covid organ damage. recent studies brain damage loss IQ among mild cases concerning ""Adverse events"" includes minor things like pain injection site, citing overall reported adverse events meaningless. would present similar states covid, cause actual deaths number people reported arm ouchie. low random chance becomes likely virus essentially seed millions people within months 95%+ athletes going ""tapered."" basically opposite over-exercising.

They overtrained 3 4 weeks ago. Today, they're peak shape.  Yeah thought times, like yeah fine market single shot enable people get boosters soon become beneficial probably 8 week mark.  CDC said wont change guidance unless science changes. long science says vaccinated people need wear masks, keep guidance needs 'Explain like Covid' section bottom.  Archive link: change brand, they‚Äôre saving Pfizer doses age 12-18. perhaps mom could find safe living conditions? would asking live separately change mind, wonder?   Wait, Walmart employees vaccinate people US? Don‚Äôt need special training? would nice, conversely, it'll get worse Winter restrictions put place again. 

Really hoping UK pull this, headline purely factual yet taken UK beat covid-19 surge. know another two weeks.

Very well written post however. Appreciate compilation evidence facts. Quebec's case seems variant actually sort beneficial. getting sick preventing delta taking hold.

Oh god. isn‚Äôt going end well. Terry, want take one? Remember talk ""Sweden live experiment human sacrifice?""

Well, Australia probably opposite now. live experiment futility zero COVID. know Olympians treat bodies like temples would rather test positive completely miss (in many cases) chance life compete Olympics.

- Quinine (as quina-brand supplement - 10 drops/day) 
- Quercetin 400 mg/day 
- Vitamin C 1000 mg/day
- Vitamin D3 1000 IU/day

Well, shit, twisted sure. Sigh. think thinking ""if take vaccine, someone I'm competing take vaccine, advantage available training time"".. especially since 2nd dose kicks lot people's asses. guess it‚Äôs wealthy donor class.

I think we're turning corner this. Governor Baker yesterday said fact cases, surprising. big difference cases one vaccinated, cases 4.3 million people vaccinated.

Yes, totally advertised back late 2020.

Howrver, agree guy needs take personal responsibility acting like moron. got second Pfizer shot first week April. tested positive last Friday. rough. Gonna lot less Republican voters come 2024 keep passing vaccine. effectiveness mean serious illness getting all?

But since May CDC counts hospitalized infections deaths ""cases"". Asymptomatic, light, moderate infections called ""breakthrough infections"".

""Infection"" ""case"" used mean thing, unvaccinated people every infection considered case.

But now, every infection considered case vaccinated people. serious ones are.

So ""cases"" equal ""cases"". depends talking vaccinated unvaccinated people. 

This article explains muddled way ..

[Post-vaccination Infections Come 2 Different CDC responded inquiry designation saying ‚ÄúSARS-CoV-2 infection‚Äù indicates positive tests virus ‚ÄúCOVID case‚Äù refers person positive test meets case definitions, ‚Äúthroughout COVID terms infection case often used interchangeably.‚Äù May 1, CDC controversially switched reporting strategy documenting breakthrough cases involving form hospitalization death, skewing national counts further. don‚Äôt blame Pfizer seeing lowering efficacy numbers wanting plan boosters/updated vaccines. enrolled kids school requires masks, parents choose send kids charter school send elsewhere, good kids school people decided use masks. Yeah, possible. Prior COVID vaccines especially, lower income urban areas hit hard covid.. however virus contagious vaccines free readily available‚Ä¶ large portion deaths believe vaccine unnecessary harmful. group many Republicans find themselves, group becomes at-risk‚Ä¶ louder republican leaders scream. 

I‚Äôm saying minorities.. anyone really.. lower income areas aren‚Äôt still heavily impacted. Obviously can't know sure longterm data, seems incredibly unlikely asymptomatic infection could cause longterm effects Wtf told us mix them... really get one each?  Maybe later winter might change. It‚Äôs crazy people hung masks. Delta breakthrough Los Angeles, watch out. I'm talking vaccines. talking precedent denying coverage based personal choices lead.

Companies always going lengths get away make money. decisions become essentially preexisting conditions, bad time lot people.

Rock climbing? Mountain biking? Sorry, coverage. Eat much fast food? bad sad. Choose sedentary job? exercise? Good luck. Take lot road trips? car accident. He‚Äôll show us. brainwashed. facts dead wrong. Blow yourself. Hey, every dive bar unventilated! Yeah, months hope vaccines better extremely mediocre flu vaccines get every year. That's I've recently helped, cause parents finally let use car. rough, could spend weeks within 4 walls really sucked since parents interest anything watch Netflix, fine, I'm different. 

But yeah that's I'll pass time ig MuH rELiGuOs eXeMpTiOn???? know why, stocks vaccines, people get sick boost sells shots. Children virus best shot getting parents sick fourth. gives fuck guy say. even news. CBS reporting things crazy people say Yes, unfortunately wait see pans Delta's rise elsewhere. Time tell numbers hold. Idk there‚Äôs lot sub seem think vaccines prevent everything asymptomatic mild Covid.

Those numbers 80‚Äôs delta mix - pessimistic numbers Israel 64 recently ~40% Wow, remember thinking thing. hard believe stuff precious gold little ago. received second dose March (Virginia). going volunteer take asymptomatic Covid tests positive result means two weeks unpaid leave ahead? research support that.

Nobody knows Delta affect schools. hoping. last year people obsessed #savethechildren, people refuse wear mask get vaccinated actually save children‚Ä¶ Sounds like pretty quick way insurance company lose 40% customers freedom insurance new company like   80% effectiveness - vaccinated person 20% relative risk unvaccinated person. 1/5th base risk unvaccinated person

If Israel right protection decreases numbers, it‚Äôs looking like 64% 1/3rd relative risk unvaccinated person already (at least) 2 lawsuits hospital systems made vaccination condition employment. cases, hospital system won. 

The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission also issued ruling vaccination required condition employment: ruling specifically addressed concerns civil rights, among things. get trying make general point, mean Reddit thing hone one little phrase, masks absolutely lot curb spread less contagious variants. Seems boil a. less effective masks b. poor mask wearing, though perhaps that's meant. letting know Texas San Antonioz seeing rise Delta strain hospitals. 48 percent doctors nurses anti vaccinated, hand us mask made China, paper thin, would collect particles covid 19 breathe knowing touching everything else. ridiculous. would make sense everyone vaccinated, children, babies pregnant woman? assume there‚Äôs way view English? find completely un-navigatable is. good news that's primarily vaccine getting African countries. Crowded indoor area Saturday friend's bachelor weekend... Atlanta. south vaccinate figure there. Correct. I‚Äôm quoting Pfizer here, claimed equal efficacy across age demographics. They're adults, understand rules rules that's it. quickly fall line. it. Seek own. 

I'm wits end hearing constant variations ""Delta gonna find vaccinated"" action CDC. Simply pointing flaw statement ""I would, i'm vaccinated."" Like agree stupid statement given news lately.

Agreed points planning make (though never challenged it). also comfortable situation far away islands land borders rather middle 20 something countries different approaches. control airports‚Ä¶ link shows controlled setting ‚Äî key math \*meaning\* anything reality. Idk think capitalism ""mirroring"" survival fittest (also seems like misunderstanding phrase means). Capitalism literally killing planet right now, refusing remove patent restrictions vaccines keep making profit breading new dangerous variants poor countries can't keep financially vaccination patent price, also entire climate crisis anthropocene extinction event experiencing right now. That's survival looks like. Like buying mask covid, made china, 3M , 3M masks made America. I'm sure implying... vast majority people LA take public transportation walk buy groceries Hahaha America. thought could come together shopping malls, Starbucks, sticking libs important. Misleading, clickbaity headlines like literally killing people. Selection bias, asymptomatic. Nothing see here. Move stop posting crap. family medicaid, pay copays. opposite fancy, pays everything. Downvoted posting facts. That's r/coronavirus CDC isn‚Äôt tracking this, states (Virginia, California, Massachusetts etc.) well study healthcare workers Houston area hospital found 80.3% efficacy delta(hospital workers first people offered vaccine USA).

Every study data set says something like 80%-88% efficacy besides Israel. 

I get little heated people citing doomerish data lately dismissing likelihood Israel one giving bad data. Anecdotal, two astrazeneca shots trial. got two Pfizers February. Zero side effects them.  Vaccinated choice. honestly paper mask F joke. First supposed protect overs coughing wear one vice versa, KEEP mind makes F sense EVERYONE touches mask wherever go, F itchy, touch touch shit around store, debit keypads, door knobs handles, products shelves people touch like wait need back. Lolz seriously. made china fucking china people probably even wearing mask make label sterile yeah F right. gonna get covid would literally walk someone's cough, kiss, breathe someone, touch surfaces. Fucked. Sadly, yes. Quebec strain that‚Äôs barely competed delta  NZ economy actually overheating, anything. We've 2.4% GDP growth year year. unemployment rate low [businesses begging We're likely one first places world raise interest rates.

My bestfriend fully vaccinated COVID right sick. mother brother also got it, also vaccinated, also sick.

I'm buying ticket planning going we'll see. Things bad right they're getting worse. think that's freaking realistic. Everything big question mark. mother poor health COVID, even mild case would devastating her. doubt schools seeing much way deaths.  ""Daily reminder""

Please get hobby. that, really bad mutating already vaccinated people new variant could become resistant vaccines. biologists raised concerns instantly labeled antivaxx conspiracy theorists. sure solution could've though. Hell yeah brother, cheers Iraq. did. thought interesting compare now. Science great, gets ignored. WINTER COMING. basically turn Magneto. 5g abilities incomprehensible humans. English translation üëÜüëÜüëÜüëÜ dates back March. Hopefully get update soon, current anecdotal reports suggest younger, healthier people increasingly risk. assertion true we‚Äôd seeing overwhelming amount breakthrough cases people 60 healthcare workers. We‚Äôre not(thank god).

The CDC explicitly tracking one lowest point testing we've ever been. I'm saying Israel's numbers outlier, monitoring poor, ""who knows"" situation. arrived yesterday! Glad hear vaccination rate high. Though wonder tourist go through. 100% people vaccinated spread mild cases other, still means 100% infections breakthrough. would obviously lot less infections higher percentage people vaccinated, likely higher percentage breakthrough cases compared unvaccinated cases. R0 delta like 2x alpha iirc Every fucking day sub there's headline

""Vaccine roll(60-93)% effective."" Shit needs stop  keep wearing masks you‚Äôre good. Yes, breakthrough cases delta. Actually, 95% effective doesnt mean that. means vaccinated group 95% less disease unvaccinated group. Since part unvax group wont get it, actually means practice less 5% chance getting it. actually small Oh no. Anyway.  Huh. senior citizens hence reason also known ""God's Waiting Room"" :P It‚Äôs even lower. Check Israel‚Äôs data. 39%-41%  That's spirit, better broken time letting population get killed... war time, unfortunately heroes. also state another reason results could Aran said people decline get vaccinated are, indisproportionately high numbers, people skeptical existence danger COVID-19, distrustful health services, overall relatively unlikely get tested.  probably finding, testing, minority instances unvaccinated people get coronavirus ‚Äî statistics rely comparison makes effectiveness vaccinated seem much lower,‚Äù Aran said. Great! Bad Tennessee trying something stupid.

We decided push trip back December 2022, hoping US specifically Florida it‚Äôs act together‚Ä¶but I‚Äôm holding breath. There's way enough doses available world vaccinate Olympic athletes, even many TIL Olympics began. Huh.  explain think child's fault caregiver get vaccinated?

Is child's fault parent smokes 2 packs day?

Never said child's fault. breakthrough cases? regular cases? different vaccine shows mid 60s alpha slightly less delta. 

Not really similar comparison it? So? can‚Äôt compete. hard? data percentage breakthrough cases present symptoms?

Before vaccinations, telltale signs COVID cold: high fever, loss smell/taste, etc.

Wondering symptom profile breakthrough cases well. Sounds like experience. 

I felt better evening. Ahh alright, thank :) Yep! frustrating hell, too. us want risk getting infected new virus without long-term research behind it. bet want. tiny price pay peace mind come Michigan... idiots related idiots, here. great since there's unvaccinated players, sure much help. players' unions flip unvaccinated players cut. Darwin Olympics Greenland closed borders.   Well, certainly ass, like meter off, I'm sorry. friends, friends family, players refereed competing year I'm worried upset whole thing there's nowhere real put frustration. bad percentage mean though? First dose 36% effective death? Catching? Hospitalisation?  Mask mandates applying vaccinated people marginalization plain simple. Given vaccine less 100% effective, inevitable, news, sure it‚Äôs happening somewhere. would significant proportion vaccinated get infected severe symptoms compared unvaccinated. WTF think question end want that?

I (at least kind of) understand people sort actual end goal, although realistic helpful goals, much ""keep masks things better!"" actual endpoint way get there. goal mask mandate recommendation specific point, general? Agreed Man imagine schitzo. honestly think significant number healthy athletes die covid? Well that‚Äôs dumb take. Covid concern children, extent you‚Äôre projecting here.

Most people know want protect Long Covid.

The CDC/Admin factor need vaccines children (if approved) also want make task getting vaccinated seem less important (or easy) gotten original 2-shots. tired take assumes parties demographics act good faith. tired garbage. Get better material.  Yup. Seeing lot irresponsible behavior everywhere I've posted reasons think see many deaths. Kids 18 low risk covid, data backs up. Teachers vaccinated, aren't, that's choice.

How post reasons think see great bloodbath? aunt's cousins brothers mom's daughters half step sisters dog saw otherwise Facebook... that's said urine test results came out. don‚Äôt want contract COVID, even vaccine protects severe illness hospitalization, I‚Äôll keep masking. I‚Äôm tired tip toeing around ignorant. I‚Äôm tired word ‚Äúdisinformation‚Äù. told mom eat last cookie‚Ä¶that wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúdisinformation‚Äú, lie! guy article trash! Canada due supply constraints. gap 4 weeks little now, since came many vaccines. Tell facebook expert friends ""Stupid"" turning maladaptation 2021. Louis CK talked said need bring lions back human society. ""bad people"" = maladapted? Paywall. know IOC offered doses participants. good thing. doses come normal vaccines pool country have. surprise many people angry. Meaning, whatever interval recommended locally, Pfizer's recommendation? mostly thought experiment since much option besides following local protocol (UK appears still using spaced dosing).

Found links, much appreciated. actually thrive go far. flop masks data based. struggling public policy wanted save masks medical professionals.  literally never going happen. public want it, economy can't handle it, politicians stomach it. 

Never gonna happen. Get fuckin vaccine, Jesus Christ, isn‚Äôt hard works data. guess work

Yeah, like said ***""there‚Äôs reason walking around mask‚Äù***

Great guy, is... 

Anyone worked developing vaccines knows secondary shot timetables ALWAYS minimum, maximum. takes certain amount time antibodies drop enough t-cells &amp; memory B cells get activated. UK evidence extended timelines signal stronger responses. Fauci ignored it. Yeah I'm looking forward that. sister generally pretty smart friends shit l*b crunchy moms threw caution window. two 5 year Olds 18 month old obviously vaccinated going parties traveling without masks. started criticizing home schooling high risk kid allowing nieces here. shit show I'm tired it. Papers evaluated individually. disagree MDPI standards generally lower, shitty publishing practices everywhere. Including, like commenter said, biggest journals world. TBH, bad papers published journals like Nature ultimately make far larger impacts stuck lower-level journals like published MDPI. (see: STAP cells, one paper bacteria Arsenic-based DNA replacing phosphorus, etc...)

This appears mostly nothingburger review could published anywhere. sub told delta variant makes vaccines useless never leave houses !

/s Because‚Ä¶.duh   ""My body fine-tuned machine, want chemicals disrupting balance. I'm young, healthy, invincible."" people decided pandemic personally vaccinated.

 lot us never got luxury pretending life back normal - either young kids are/know people still vulnerable vaccinated.  Good it‚Äôs getting approved. Currently availability Moderna quite good EU Pfizer delivering less June Moderna delivering more.  already Covid certificate (as European countries?!) think get mandatory vaccination. talks charging (mandatory shop) tests would solve problem lazy people... Incredible getting downvoted. N=? Well that‚Äôs new one folks vaccinated high risk virus.

If vaccinated, risk choosing take. I‚Äôm also liberal area see thing.  what‚Äôs funny people still wearing I‚Äôd say 30% don‚Äôt cover nose anyway lol Simple, use common sense, everything our/their power stop unvaccinated people participating. spread vaccinated, absolutely, limit contact limiting spread. We're like year half pandemic, know enough safely measures put (masks etc), widely available vaccine. literally reason point time allow unvaccinated people continue F things us. Why? vaccines work well delta  COVID animal reservoirs. Also vaccines effective symptomatic disease it‚Äôs unclear effective asymptomatic disease + vaccines available world effective hospitalization effective catching disease (and spreading it). Add fact bunch people won‚Äôt get vaccinated don‚Äôt know yet long vaccine protection lasts people might get future boosters. live virus foreseeable future. Luckily it‚Äôs big deal us choose get vaccinated‚Ä¶ Like said, speculation. Based nothing one-sided understanding world.  vaccinated. Vaccinations help prevent getting disease, 100% protection. upset stomach scratchy throat 3 weeks ago. I'm fully vaccinated even think possibly covid. thought possibly ate something bad year round allergy dilemma. seeing many breakthrough cases, wish would thought get tested. 

Good news, I'm still careful go wear mask. many times get vaccinated flu? Me: 0 Dude like dozen downvotes 10 minutes, comment true enough LOL. 80% population isnt vaccinated though, 13.4% people whole world fully vaccinated. it. You‚Äôre blinded don‚Äôt see attitude contributing problem. can‚Äôt learn accept people‚Äôs views treat respect, things get worse evidence top-up current vaccines would prevent breakthroughs though.

They would need reformulate spike protein vaccine. systems clogged countries (Germany name one).

It's easy get vaccine Germany. places show without appointment get one. far 60% total population got one dose, seems unlikely get much higher supply exceeds demand. thing stupid question chances getting covid dust trash unlikely yet perhaps, hopefully hold up. past daily new case peak UK - still around 50K. Again, seeing saw leaping conclusion. main point outbreak crisis scenarios 100% preventable, LONGER WORRIED OVERSTATING THREAT. One vaccinated healthcare worker dying antivaxxer DAMN MUCH GIVE. Cases also spiking vaccination rate slowing down. 75% people Kazakhstan say refuse vaccinated.  wonder air conditioning bill it'd take run June encouraging numbers indeed. Denmark also almost 70% still young group far done. Belgium Spain also crazy good uptake numbers.  will, like flu. It‚Äôs coronavirus  Yup too. every peak called, accurately, insulted. 

Well, still folks. I'll tell fall winter going absolute disaster. worst. Flu kills lot people‚Ä¶never late realize FIu shot worth getting üíâüíâüíâüíâ people train lives they're going get virus likely keep competing probably allow ever return. Hong Kong someone got arrested so.

Since paid state, careful, especially type database gets vaccines are. appreciate you, u/BombAssTurdCutter o7 Austria (depending region) funny, running willing arms, way bring shot forward time, 10 days go...  EU also bought excess vaccines. boosters needed, would silly them. agree everything said now.  specifically called fact eligible refusing vaccinate putting ineligible risk. fact 70/80% eligible vaccinated risk unvaccinated drop significantly; look New England region country high level vaccination compare states low level vaccination. area longer offering remote option homeschooling option us. send kids school person without vaccine.

Quite pickle. hide basement?

Can't least acknowledge delta issue kids schools?

They need policy update based delta.  American lives Texas, don't. need future generations radicalized left. Fuck getting along conservatives, fuck working together. time over. Either America shifts left done. That‚Äôs issue, issue thinking get new vaccines every time last one isn‚Äôt effective virus constantly evolve.. Well sad sucks 88% isn‚Äôt 100. numbers climb predicting article still fraction saw winter surge. likely increased immunity exposure/infection, *very least* months.

Think like booster, extra. three vaccines US give immune response spike protein, probably antibodies viral proteins too.    Interesting. Read morning. good. know getting data, Massachusetts (71% one shot, 61% fully vaccinated) 5,166 breakthrough infections 4.3 million vaccinated. Massachusetts actually tracks information still even though CDC not. 

Further, 300 vaccinated people hospitalized 79 vaccinated died (most congregate care). 

So infection rates rising, mostly amongst unvaccinated, translating higher hospitalizations deaths vaccinated nearly infections asymptomatic mild. 

So bunch unvaccinated crazies start dropping like flys, I'm really pressed that. got mine 3. Fuck. researchers want make distinction upper lower respiratory tract infections breakthrough cases agree done good job communicating press public concept limited nasal infection may occur vaccinated individuals. Understanding regional aspects (upper versus lower respiratory tract) vaccine effectiveness key ensure public confidence vaccines well help public understand need continue adhering public health mitigation Thing is. 40% little stop spread probably go next months. 64% two weeks ago. 

This means cannot take grandma grandpa restaurant even vaccinated people around cannot certain he/she get infected still high risk hospitalization vaccine also likely less effective population.    expectations waaay high. fact people able create multiple vaccines covid year massive feat medical world. fact vaccine already highly effective variants doesn‚Äôt require changes incredible. thinking vaccine 100 percent effective virus it‚Äôs variants forever time soon, going disappointed.  think vaccines might save us complete collapse medical system, they're probably going way capacity thanks half country unvaccinated. It‚Äôs funny sub changes positions quickly. Everyone happy hearing CDC lifting masking guidance vaccinated, everyone says they‚Äôre masking even they‚Äôre vaccinated. 

I‚Äôm wearing mine! I‚Äôm vaccinated care catch not, I‚Äôll wear it‚Äôs required. 39% extremely unfortunate. 95% unvaxxed die lifetime complications. Besides burden health care system, don‚Äôt really care, you? national embarrassment really troublesome  not? send one showing even minor long term damage considering even smallest long term issues end Olympic career permanently

""It can't happen me"" did. Jesus Christ. wondering they'll even able complete events toward end games, least complete actual field would/should won. vaccination rates cause dip, we're seeing rise deaths; nothing stop growth.

You can't ways. 3 weeks recommended Pfizer, country lacking supplies suggest wait more. better whole country get people single doses less people double doses. medical problem, logistics problem. That‚Äôs fair. Thanks putting list resources together. unvaccinated want vaccinated?? world access yet!! don‚Äôt think understood said. okay. I'm really enjoying people's mask status none business. know I'm protected, know parents protected, know employees protected. I'm good. guys whatever. Less severity hence less lasting immunity covs. reason sars, mers, sars 2 seem different immunity wise. Literally Walmart worker leave desk walk ask needed dose yesterday (I've already two) - People TRYING hand lol  do, feel like get little time discussion subject, unfortunately I‚Äôm educated enough medically give opinion, facts difficult find specific details, especially wealth misinformation there. I'm vaccinated, I'm going outside maskless living life without concern COVID. hear/see start talking long COVID attempt deter pass moral judgement perspective fear mongering? 

Lots illnesses cause long term issues, got common, usually harmless, lung infection decade ago disabling nerve condition result. is, rare uncommon, I'm going behave differently concern something like happening although possible. flu even common cold cause long term damage, one stresses judges others wearing mask flu season, certainly top vaccinated flu even effective COVID vaccines. Nothing ever going confer 100% protection point accept good enough sake living lives. problem people wearing masks course, please judge given I'm following current science guidelines, changes things might different. something else sure... think we've quite seen like lifetimes.. Man still nightmares waking though I'm 19-22yo EMT me, gotta go back work medic.  I've BH clin 20+ yrs. can't even fathom deal care someone accusing part deep state I'm trying give 15l o2. So, wrong. COVID kill elite athletes. spread misinformation  particular poll gives us good indication likely successful vaccination drive US, ultimately, US fare combatting virus

I think article value sub Hope so, less zero. whether overly-grim picture painted person institution concern longer, least vaccination rates better. concerned widespread tendency assume best case I'm seeing, gotta tell you.  next variant based Delta variant, still similar hence still good booster? person explained medical field, sure dumbed quite bit could understand. asked mutations. know probably lot it. Thank link, love learning this.  No, know true yet. indeed. look do, say. good advice march last year, good advice today. Point /r/anosmia long covid subs. upvoted, mRNA technology mean work way similar quality/efficacy. CureVac also used mRNA technology, 50% efficacy rating. Novavax instead uses decades old synthetic spike protein technology extremely effective. think elderly well-vaccinated now. lowers average case age, increases average survival rate. agree keeps rising lockdown  recent data Israel. gave varying results different countries. May time since vaccination making difference, age vaccinated individuals. know enough yet. look number vaccinated testing positive even US, see significantly less protection infection Delta.  definite, somewhat probable fucking stupid risk point, sounds like beginning PR disaster Let's say next 25 days 100k first doses per day. makes 2,5 million people. add 50,4 million already vaccinated least once, get 53 million. 64 % population vaccinated. 

So far proper incentives sight. Neither positive (money getting vaccinated) negative ones like restrictions non vaccinated guess chance next big country voting end September. might take bit longer new government ready make decisions. UK started manufacturing Novavax back Feb, still indications approval getting requested. 

Maybe available time booster... I'm confident claims FDA Approval ""won't matter"" one change opinion.

Everyone never will, large numbers people changed minds since vaccines first authorized. again, new information (local Delta outbreak) changed people's minds. FFS, what's big deal wearing mask indoors?
I can't imagine history say us telling story COVID 19 pandemic. height intelligence fought masks. üò£ comment still stands well. seeing decrease efficacy time. Israel, vaccinated January showing 40 percent effective rate symptomatic infection. got March.....are still 88. 

So yes. clearly need boosters, even though clear government keen saying public.

But vaccination went **12x** much, even 1/10 risk, still net exposed (1.2x) before. basic simple precautions like wearing mask sometimes keeping distance easily tip scale ""you're safe"" territory. seems like many vaccinated people going full-hog ""pandemic's let's party"" mode they're helping perpetuate spread themselves. Oh sure. kids taking precautions, including continuing distance learning. like food, thought long-term loss taste smell enough reason me. last change absolutely assinine.  long natural immunity last? hate needles too, legit thought nurse somehow missed arm accidentally vaccinated me. asked said needle really really small. skeptical next day arm hurt like hell.

I think vaccines need PR spin. Like ""If prior medical conditions, weaker everyone else need vaccine healthy people"".

Got idea someone wear mask breathe it. response ""Then COVID tougher people"". get vaccinated, admit ignorant asshole past year actions killed others. reasoning Finland. lack vaccines long time. work, vaccinated people maskless. Unvaccinated not, enforced.

The best real-world proof infectious way takes dominant strain. UK essentially 100% delta, example. wont without complaint, I'm skeptical they'll point. 


I've people tell wearing mask punishment, got downvoted greatly saying disagreed statement. ‚ÄúHow many times teach lesson, old man?!‚Äù you‚Äôre republican state you‚Äôre gonna wearing mask long long time. It‚Äôs gonna stop go years unfortunately. Please wear mask EVERYWHERE next days prevent spread get tested positive. It‚Äôs least do. getting stuff ready, making 300million doses year India next month (that's expecting). lockdowns like beginning last year 3‚Ä¶2‚Ä¶1‚Ä¶. That's symptomatic infections, severe disease. FYI 

there also nasty common cold going around Los Angeles... daughters caught it, gave wife, grandma brother. sure dodged ?

Went pick-up OTC medicine Walgreens shelves empty Florida start August well. common southern states. August hottest month year. waste. LOL IMAGINE BELIEVING pretty ironic, that's mechanism virus. hijacks cells create virus copies. What's frustrating us get vaccine earlier. healthy 25 year old dude Spain, instantly requested vaccine moment autonomous community opened web page age group so, appointment first dose set July 15th. first dose I'm waiting second one set August 5th. super late, fucking choice get late. frustrating. I‚Äôm waiting inevitable ‚Äúback lockdown‚Äù news. completely agree last sentence,what last couple years given impression sense common? I'm needles. I'm terrified them, I'd rather came knife. easy, especially second shot. felt first one, painful. second one really sure whether actually done not. sore either. 16 hours though felt sick night. Wait that's going hilarious anti-vax propagandists manage parse CDC data

""CDC ADMITS VACCINE TURNS COVID SUPER DEADLY VIRUS VACCINATED ""

And official data make legitimately look like that's what's happening. Cool! would weird couldn't, like exposed virus vaccine, different vaccine? immune system cope, seem difficult break. think it, they're exposed bits viruses day, every day. What's objection taking it?  important note definitely still catch - especially delta variant. see stats saying 20% new cases vaccinated, worth understanding many folks also tested work recreational activities, vaccinated, potentially turning scary stats people would otherwise sought test (non severe symptoms). 

It much important see much hospitalization rates fully vaccinated 88% stat seems imply numbers still well general population. 

It worth vaccinated Delta variant spiking vaccine still offers best current protection. also see benefits simply vaccinated counties across nation spiking less badly non-vaccinated ones, even naturally share level safety measures place state level. Engineering occupationally geared. learn system works necessarily teach refined critical thinker. quite different rest sciences constantly position question claims colleagues evaluate well substantiated are. time immune system tied battling one thing, get sideswiped something else. Strep &amp; staph incredibly common environment, easily flare patient pretty much illness. poster incorrect. 88% effective means reduction infection compared unvaccinated person. 
For example, Let‚Äôs say 1000 unvaccinated 1000 vaccinated people sit room COVID-19 patient, 100 unvaccinated people get symptomatic Covid-19. 88% effective vaccine means 12 vaccinated people get Covid-19. 
(Also 12 vaccinated people get covid much less likely hospitalized). 

88% effective mean 880 1000 vaccinated people symptom free etc‚Ä¶ relative would happen group unvaccinated people. That‚Äôs delta problem‚Ä¶ contagious increased absolute number unvaccinated people getting it, 88% effective vaccine result cases covid-19 exposed vaccinated people covid got vaccine? dumbest interview I've ever read life... pretty easy state actually. lockdowns first wave truly know expect, action first wave really happen areas.
 
Since they've figured contact tracing short sharp lockdowns work best. Last month 7 infections region went snap lockdown 4 days. able open back masks gathering limits. Comparatively, neighbouring state (where outbreak started) delayed lockdowns couple weeks tried trace infections lockdown small areas, city 5 million people lockdown month case numbers still hovering around 100 per day (which much global standards, 100 turns 1000 couple days without intervention). lockdown numbers back around 10 per day (probably), take another month rate. Basically, delaying actions couple weeks they've caused months hurt.
 
Of course, delaying action securing supply mRNA vaccines couple months, federal government kept us state lockdown limbo next year least - basically ended back queue domestic manufacturing PFizer Moderna vaccines. incomprehensible save cost vaccines deal restrictions months longer. **day** lockdown major capital city causes enough financial loss pay entire country vaccinated. implication exposed 10 minutes different exposed 100 minutes, crash 50 mph different crash 150 mph. Still really pass smell test. think invalid statistically try draw conclusions individual's protection level aggregate group statistics. agree businesses countries interests shareholders. flu still dangerous children?  It‚Äôs far off‚Ä¶ 187m Pfizer doses 136m
Moderna 20 yo daughter 2nd Pfizer shot early Feb tested positive Monday. symptom scratchy throat. plays college volleyball caught unvaccinated teammate along 4 vaccinated players. cases mild except unvaccinated player moderate. good people misguided

aka dumbass barring religious medical reasons?

In 2019, Christians represent 65% total adult population, 43% identifying Protestants, 20% Catholics, 2% Mormons. People formal religious identity 26% total population.  quote wiki

that's already many people one many reasons. received second shot? feeling? chance get herd immunity, enough people (80%+ delta), would pretty much gone away. chance anti-vax idiots. I'm ""side"" though, stay idiots, I'm pretty much ok idiots get suffer consequences. fight closures shutdowns tooth nail, now. Look NFL players publicly saying they're getting shot. 

People something every single day 100% guaranteed short-term *AND* long-term negative side effects body health. even risk factor, certainty. faced that, they're still in. faced imaginary, near negligible risk, say ""nah, can't cross line.""

You allowed drive car without valid driver's license. allowed drink alcohol age 21. allowed slander someone cry fire movie theater. required pay relevant taxes. Violating rules (and million others) end jail.

All things somehow curtail personal freedoms. Therefore government compels variety things penalties disobey.

My question is: US government totalitarian hellhole?

(Again totally independent vaccines CDC. philosophical curiosity.) current COVID-19 surge U.S. ‚Äî fueled highly contagious delta variant ‚Äî steadily accelerate summer fall, peaking mid-October, daily deaths triple now. Vaccination rates still shockingly low Atlanta metro area. Young people minorities especially hesitant resistant. J&amp;J uses delivery system AZ modified, stabilized form spike protein mRNA vaccines use. unfortunate little data released performing real world really bit different vaccines. think anyone outside clinical trials knows one-dose efficacy compares two-doses vaccines real world, especially Delta circulating. Sounds good. It‚Äôs like deny covid big deal yet 
Obsessed talking it/being subreddit. Really ? thought low vaccination rate 4% first dose get vaccines making home !
Must factors involved ?   That's right call. infrastructure able check half pre-flight Covid tests already caught 100 people without tests 100 people entering NZ banned Covid hotspots. would matter time Delta slipped through. 

We really can't open bubble back totally crush Delta NSW, looks unlikely, much higher vaccination rate, like December. purely anecdotal couple neighborhood live got covid delta. One vaccinated wasn‚Äôt. vaccinated individual felt unwell day. unvaccinated one couldn‚Äôt open eyes 12 days hospital 3 times. 

All vaccinated people, including wife, around tested negative covid, symptoms. Several people unvaccinated ended getting sick ended hospitalized. wife skeptical vaccine experience really solidified effective really are. feel way gets hospital bill? 62% Adults 16+. LA lot kids, 0-16 year olds, percentage lower. Nah, insurance increase premiums, like smokers example. Getting near 100% effectiveness anything biology ridiculously hard. immune system variation humans wildly complex miracle current vaccines well. can't judge things compared artificial human grading system, even imperfect work get A+s. others said, one effective vaccines ever developed. Israel say 42% effective real world study. 


Isn't meant contradict Israeli's latest numbers. There's definitely lot people Australia talking it, luckily suppression group out, we've gone far without massive outbreaks commit we're vaccinated.  Aggressive right word. Los Angeles, high rate previous infection decent vaccination rate, Delta still able gain traction. Amazing. rural South disadvantage. Stay safe, friend. feels like bad take. many injuries medical issues come poor decisions. Whether accidents reckless, lung cancer smoking, heart issues poor eating, etc. Making bad decisions, due ignorance, impulse, lack discipline, constitute large majority medical issues. insurance could deny this, could deny almost everything Exactly. Previous stats also symptomatic infection. ‚Äúdistinction‚Äù also lacks appropriate context.

They've actually fast tracked approval process. Could come early August. I'm still wearing mask even get second shot. Delta hotspot think would even weren't. certainly hurt anything. Require school employment?

I understand people come from. genuinely scared vaccine, id hate force it. seems like lesser two evils leopard need eat face AGAIN? supposed go office next week. I‚Äôve fence, would feel better third booster shot. Preliminary data shows third booster shot provides quite jump antibodies cells. 

Given heard 20% Covid infections LA vaccinated, leaning towards going office. 

Besides. boss another part country. difference home office boss still entirely remote me?

It‚Äôs time let folks choose whether want third dose not. doses. help. don‚Äôt know FDA denied Pfizer‚Äôs request. Stupid.

Same testing people, barely even time realize swab nose. article:

The vaccine‚Äôs effectiveness preventing severe cases vaccinated January remains 86%, according figures, slightly lower vaccinated following months.

Prominent epidemiology experts have¬†cast doubt, however, Health Ministry‚Äôs claims COVID vaccine experienced major drop effectiveness recent months. Exactly delta viral loads insane Anyone read five year old Georgia died covid? Didn‚Äôt seem pre existing conditions also something doesn‚Äôt seem right there. strep staph Covid? Something seems there. Ha...I wish happened 2nd. nurse hit nerve sent shock wave arm. shoulder fingers started twitching. like hitting funny bone inside arm central...it's entire arm. Take look happened India 2 months ago.  fully approved FDA vaccine, insurance companies spike rates anyone vaccinated? Seems like easy way get people vaccinated talked it‚Äôs going happen. know stupid be... never message. one said vaccine 100% effective. protected getting vaccinated, mean complete protection. know dosage works. There's reason Pfizer two shots. There's reason Moderna one shot.

I think it‚Äôs clear talking ass. 

Moderna 2 shot. Pfizer. 

J&amp;J 1 shot. mind asking get two RNA doses one? son got JNJ wondering also get RNA that's even allowed US.  report also stating replicating faster(in hosts), would also likely (I assuming here, domain expert) mean higher (relative) viral load across air-tract, spread mouth-nose maybe fitness also allows survive tiny bit longer body infecting next host. 

So inherent fitness (reproductive level) may causing outcompeting variants. mortician preparation open casket funeral. artificially low. thousands ""non entertainment"" workers involved set. Caterers, cleaners, drivers, contractors, medical staff, site representatives, personal assistants, etc. 

My job technically defined entertainment industry, end set 4 5 times year. Including covid. hard find working age Angelino worked set point. people nutty nature. Im vaccinated say let burn. Don‚Äôt care anymore. functionally equivalent. know water California. wait 8 weeks instead 3 weeks second dose? ""Each Pfizer vaccination administers 30 micrograms actual vaccine. Moderna gives much larger doses, 100 micrograms.""

So they're tech Moderna's payload 3x+ bigger. think would fall category legitimate medical reasons able take vaccine. ability make exceptions regard certainly hope would one they'd make for. No, that‚Äôs actually pretty cut dry exception rules.

If you‚Äôre medically incapable taking it, rates go don‚Äôt. Masks still required job wear outside see grocery store enjoy laugh guess? supposed make feel something? üòÇüòÇ Well, think reinforced second point.  lack replacement staff available candidates, pay scale. perfectly valid (but necessarily perfectly morally acceptable) say facilities can't replace lost employees new ones willing work unsafe conditions, stressful situations, below-market pay. 1 shot? haven‚Äôt gotten second shot since saw fb post people experiences elevated entities past get sick second shot üòÆ. Seriously. I'm tired people engaging type constructive conversation assume every single person saying ""Fuck yeah, pandemic over!"" wants cower inside reason.

Nah, us choice leave would love opportunity year half stuck inside people foaming mouth end restrictions. Farm supply stores actually able keep stock treating parasites animals. know any, mind sharing them? Effective ‚Ä¶ what?

Lazy reporting.

Edit: ‚Äúsymptomatic disease‚Äù 
That‚Äôs pretty good! Astra + Pfizer ?   Yes. Methotrexate. feel exhausted covid. everything right still got mild hadn‚Äôt lost taste would know. shots. America feel like everyone wanted get vaccinated chance let burn through. sympathy anymore. idea spend forty billion dollars interesting California already conducted lottery, incentives answer here. 53% L.A. County residents fully vaccinated. ... cases confirmed countywide June, Ferrer said 20% occurred residents fully vaccinated.

So check math here. vaccine nothing, would expect 50% cases among fully vaccinated LA. numbers, 40% fully- vaccinated 50% (20% total) covid.

So LA last month, fully vaccinated reducing chances getting covid two-thirds?

Am getting wrong somehow? Let em last line hope get treated .The unvaccinated like say body freedom Gdamn choice get vaccine care bout others fuck em.  test positive, luck there! Thank you, this. appreciate response! FWIW, thought nurse might bungled second injection minor soreness kicked next day. Felt NOTHING.  going need work kinks first like buddy mine vaccination State lives unable verify software Passport uses cannot accommodate suffixes. 

He 3rd (III) vaccination submitted State First Name, Last Name III. wife suffix name received vaccine time issue verifying vaccination. 

He unable get anyone fix it, app support suggested un-install re-install it, beyond said contact State. contacted State recommended contact app support. 

Doesn't instill confidence really required would able attend things even though fully vaccinated. seeing intense push back high quality education America. result decades poor education.

Why education poor America? public education America based real estate taxes. Poor counties poor education. 

The bible belt opposed education sciences. doubles rural areas. 

Poverty also creates drop outs youngsters get jobs help pay bills. 

The impediment high quality education legacy issue: summer vacation three months long. need summer vacation help farm long past. Children coming back summer vacation greeted month review. waste third year every summer. Year round school would provide four years education public school without adding years. 

This lack education makes science, medicine uncomfortable many people, people need most.  blame young point? told put care-free best years lives hold protect vulnerable old. stay inside flatten curve. people vaccinated, area good vaccination rates, charge allow people maskless...then vaccinated people *should* maskless. That's literally got vaccine. Thanks really appreciate it! Let crybaby get another job ...17 bucks hour.  so? 

I got Pfizer first Moderna second wish waited. much uncertainty 2  documentary, people call tongue-in-cheek eerily accurate current world. released 2006. 0% effective taken. idiots ‚Äúhate guberment telling do‚Äù sure like works favor Thanks reply. misunderstand me. Keep mind even Israeli study, vaccine still provides 80+% effectiveness hospitalization 90+% death. 

Right biggest risk old people new variant emerges somewhere, variant completely evades vaccines. rate matter time. 

Say lived town houses made wood everyone owns 2 fire extinguishers. Across river, there's growing forest fire. million dollars spend protect everyone. Would buy everyone town 3rd fire extinguisher, would get plane heavy equipment start putting forest fire? Let anti-vax dimwits ruin teams chances see arrogant act. I'll bet make tons money another profession...LOL They'll comply state local goverments store managers enact enforce universal mandate.

And they're don't.

We know exactly make work, what's lacking political will.

It's anti-maskers unique areas, rather tolerated there.

Where tolerated, comply. Pfizer tested 3 week interval United States that's recommended interval here. Stove countries taken different strategies insufficient vaccines available. Interestingly there's evidence longer interval shots actually makes effective. bought N95s family, would use them? get vaccinated least using mask that's effective standard surgical fabric ones. meant Feb 2021. host die spread mutated delta variant someone else. 

Agreed. also odds like said keep rolling dice unvaccinated. chance definitely low upcoming spikes knows happen. Even becoming contagious means people die. Thats funny cuz im fully vaxxed, girlfriend fully vaxxed, hell half colleagues night life fully vaxxed, us dealing getting delta variant last 3 weeks. 

Almost like government funds agencies also government outprice us owning homes subsidize underpaying employees also something hide us. 

I wasnt radicalized everyone know whos vaccinated got ridiculously sick. still cant taste anything almost month. received 2nd dose May, infection occurred 2 months after. could've anywhere. hanging casinos, nightclubs, restaurants, etc. breathless scary. pulse oximeter get hands one (Amazon?), might help reassure alert worsening problem.

Hopefully things improve soon! right, 100% case among vaccinated everyone vaccinated. useless headline. noticed large percentage children signed clinical trials [are children part motivated Dr. Minh-Tu Do, whose sons Justin, 9, Joey, 4, became part clinical trial Rutgers.  assistant professor pediatrics Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, treated children COVID ‚Äúon daily basis,‚Äù said. seeing children admitted hospital multisystem inflammatory syndrome patients needed help breathe, relying supplemental oxygen ventilators, thought getting vaccine kids ‚Äúwas no-brainer,‚Äù said.

I'm sure Dr. insight either one us, made sure first line. That's good enough me.

It's safe. foregone conclusion approved. paper pushers twiddle thumbs, people dying.

It's hard patient right now. Imagine shock  Holy shiiiiit! Glad got jab! they‚Äôre clearly vaccinated, yet he‚Äôs forcing state live were‚Ä¶ 3 weeks never ideal time frame vaccines past. reason we're interval studies used order get vaccines asap. We'd waiting 6 months year researched like vaccines (multiple intervals, see best immune response vs longevity combo). longevity part too.. Takes years figure out.. went 3 weeks. chose common sense approach 2 months + 1 week. Pfizer. would easier got vaccinated, even father survived infection vaccine.

I wish idiots tell people social media never get vaccine untested would harm body, think intubated far harming This. Either wear correctly wear all. 

These people still understand properly wear mask... July 2021.  really roll dice (lol). I've reading Las Vegas recent surge new cases, single person know (who's vaxxed) gotten me. didn‚Äôt say wasn‚Äôt real, would appreciate misquoting No, current vaccines better vaccine. Ask countries desperate get hands right now.

Is best option choice? Probably not. I‚Äôd still take unvaccinated. Atlantic article basically agrees said. people also ones never sacrificed much last 15 months continued life normal complaining things shut every chance got, course feel need get vaccine eventually get compliance people go get plane start new job next 2-5 years get denied get vaccinated, enough time passed quietly get longer part identity. still give Remdesivir Japan ? thought working read. Awesome hear man. long term effects finally feared getting vaccinated. 

Altitude kicks ass without covid lungs want go lot higher I've been! (12,600ft)

Might well let natural selection thing June summer. Children home.

In small town, schools 800-1500 students. Delta data. real world NZ reenter party vaccine fully rolled everyone wants one. That's fully started month scheduled finish. done outbreak cant take grip overwelm healthcare system open up. well 2030*.

*So long rest world doesnt fuck everyone carrying like nothing happening new vaccine resistent variant pops up.  booster shot anyone wants it? feel like pushing misleading statistics going make people already trust issues dig even harder. Hurr durr Denmark... Read study yourself, 
   reading somewhere, forgive can't remember otherwise I'd share source, especially vaccinated people possible exposed virus produce positive test result virus live nose vaccine protect full infection. guy truly become infamous. Vaccines highly effective. Delta contagious though everyone basically getting exposed it. you‚Äôre vaccinated haven‚Äôt gotten sick yet, that‚Äôs vaccines working you. Yes. People don‚Äôt seem understand healthcare system gets overwhelmed, EVERYONE gets affected. mention amount healthcare workers either getting sick burnt out. Yes sirrrr Actually UK example. 800,000 students currently quarantine. [Fauci went far calling kept mouth shut.... embarrassed type stuff? Well particular study says efficacy Pfizer vaccine hospitalization severe disease delta variant \~90% based large population (millions vaccinated people).

&amp;#x200B;

Pfizer Inc.‚Äôs Covid-19 vaccine provided strong shield hospitalization severe disease cases caused contagious delta variant Israel recent weeks, **even though 39% effective preventing infections**, according country‚Äôs health ministry. 
 
The vaccine, developed BioNTech SE, **provided 88% protection hospitalization 91% severe illness unspecified number people studied June 20 July 17**, according report Thursday health ministry. 
 
The report said data could skewed different ways testing vaccinated groups people versus hadn‚Äôt inoculated. Still, data likely fuel debate whether booster shots given people who‚Äôve already vaccinated -- something Pfizer said plans request U.S. Israeli authorities said earlier month they‚Äôll give third round shots people weakened immune systems.

&amp;#x200B;

The data Israel, earlier access vaccines anywhere else world, contrast study U.K. paper, published week New England Journal Medicine, found two doses Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine offer 88% protection symptomatic disease caused delta variant 94% alpha variant first discovered Britain**. Public Health England also previously found Pfizer BioNTech shot 96% effective hospitalization**.

Pfizer BioNTech confident protection safety two-dose vaccine, Pfizer said statement Friday. BioNTech conducting ongoing review study data vaccine, spokeswoman said.

Analysis companies‚Äô 43,000-person clinical trial shows effectiveness symptomatic infection dips time, 95% first two months low- mid-80% range four six months second dose, Pfizer said. 
 
From Alpha Delta, Virus Mutations Cause Alarm: QuickTake 
 
The delta variant first emerged India spreading around globe governments race inoculate people, sometimes infecting already fully vaccinated Covid. mutation forced countries delay rethink plans loosen curbs businesses, activity travel. 
 
Israel one world‚Äôs effective inoculation drives, 57% population fully vaccinated, seen recent surge infections due delta. Critical cases also climbed, remain fraction peak earlier year. 
 
Prime Minister Naftali Bennett urged vaccine holdouts -- number 1.1 million people -- get inoculated, calling effective way defeat delta strain. government also reinstated restrictions indoor events plans ban flights several countries rising infection rates, including U.K. Cyprus. 
 
‚Äî assistance Naomi Kresge Oh yes assume 400k cases official number peak was, fraction real cases official number dropped 90% unless stopped testing altogether still means massive drop official cases (and probably tested cases well)

Even unvaccinated people spread asymptomatically nearly much told us beginning side effects mean didn‚Äôt good immune response vaccine? Natural selection pick one trait. Talk doctor, sub. sell product.

The Oxford vaccine developing scientists said isnt much need get booster.

But initial booster (ie. second dose) quite important develop comprehensive t-cell response. Ahh, thank putting context. Sure, shown asymptomatic infection small percentage infections. Also important note want know susceptible long COVID, generally, means likely breakthrough case vaccinated, therefore long COVID overrepresented breakthrough cases?

I know way figure out?

Either way, vaccinated clearly, majorly reduces odds getting long COVID majorly reducing odds getting COVID all.   provide citation please?  tracked down. Really interesting. Explains quickly spreads perhaps people report violent sneezing.  That's good hear, I'm took ages get second dose...  Maybe see way thin herd stupid. Well vaccine pretty much guarantee immunity Delta came around. goalposts shifted virus shifted. Science means adapting new data. malicious.  titers detect something tested whereas think test exact memory function immune system.

Here great Twitter thread looking long term immunity CoV 229E (a common cold relative covid). suggests (using stored sera) immunity could last nothing say many died Sweden compared Denmark Norway?

Sweden nothing example ignorance. guys spread anybody else know of? Iam curious good vaccines stopping spread. Dang better get rid vaccines likely we'll need booster doses every year like flu? I‚Äôm going out. I‚Äôve isolated self wife kids well play safe, wife oldest vaccinated two younger ones not. Yes, need set borders around Missouri, Arkansas, Kansas since people superspreaders. Well, considering geopolitical tensions US China, small issue could spun something negative. look recent Fauci testimony...  Thank reply unfair prick like gets live, mny ppl around world begging get treatment n cant. ppl like dont deserve Thank you. 

Still low numbers. Encouraging news vaccine efficacy. Thank you! Policing tone low blow really shows colours literally I‚Äôm telling misrepresent scientific consensus evolved time make look good.

That‚Äôs type misinformation it‚Äôs cute it‚Äôs ignorant. saw happening Wuhan, West anything Mid-March later... point, COVID self inflicted. Policing tone low blow literally I‚Äôm telling spread misinformation misrepresenting scientific consensus evolved time make look good. Question: went supermarket, percentage people wearing masks see?

Follow Question: percentage people think anti-maskers?  incorrect guess mind pumped full steroids mysterious drugs ... perhaps intubated. could worse variants already spreading won‚Äôt find weeks vaccines could enough allow society live virus.

I‚Äôd rather play safe get virus. best way continue social distance wear mask. 

I‚Äôve made far. It‚Äôs personal decision I‚Äôm lucky even option since I‚Äôm able work home. 

Our front line workers heroes I‚Äôm sorry happening. deserve better. kids first responders , also stage seen hero‚Äôs, ambulances fire trucks blocked attacked. Regardless believe terms income inequality, shutting economy disproportionately affects people covid. Period. getting misinformation somewhere. 

There absolutely evidence available vaccines losing efficacy. None.

Make sure getting information credible people [in study] vaccine longest, tells us lasts least 6 months,‚Äù added Bailey. ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs definitely longer ‚Äî it‚Äôs going drop 6 months. would concerned efficacy dropped third fact COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness remained almost unchanged span study period indication protection enduring. trying decide get second dose. got first two weeks ago. immunocompromised wait approved specialist. want wait longer three weeks second dose immunity stretched instead falling fast. like explanation three weeks used people.

Edit: clarity. Regardless think China travel ban xenophobic not, orchestrated terribly. virus already spreading rapidly throughout local communities, instead dealing responsible manner, slapped travel ban China called day thinking that‚Äôs needed done. already here, several countries hadn‚Äôt imposed travel bans on. China travel ban absolute dog shit pandering try make people believe something stop spread.  think happens transmission occurs? IRC mainly message residents. lot locals go vegas seems like affected rise delta cases.

Also wouldnt vacation right really struggling capacity airlines wont stop selling flights. Either that, half country would sign Biden‚Äôs public option comes out. Big tough guy eh, I‚Äôm cowering fear.

Go take nap. Sinovac? look data state, states surging spiked time last year well. see mid July jumps places. seasonal. mid summer congregation spike it‚Äôs 100 out. people, especially risk, get vaxed winter case spikes. I‚Äôm reading past first line clearly trolling writing super ignorant stuff saying ‚Äútake ambien‚Äù though haven‚Äôt obvious role play pissing here.

You‚Äôre exactly sort person whining months ago telling lighten COVID batting away logical arguments poor reasoning. 

Now you‚Äôre making excuses. Yess, least Helsinki area scheduling second dosis within two months, reschedule Anyways, evidence waiting little favours better immunological response. 100% sure always assumed get virus regardless high probability either showing signs, hospitalized dying. 

The vaccine cure strengthens immune system fight virus quickly effectively reduces time spreading virus around. That's always understanding.  Two different families know covid bubbles.

Adults got tested, source found, specifically told get kids tested. suggesting deny care, pay Covid related treatment pocket eligible vaccinated chose to. Yep. obvious coming us paying attention. CDC said pandemic basically vaccinated, go party July 4th.

I stayed hell home. happen time. siblings gotten sick get sick future. They're less likely die COVID whole slew things way common. Go fun. got J&amp;J shot April. Two weeks ago, signed online mRNA shot nearby chain pharmacy. technically lie, I'd never received mRNA vaccine before, volunteer I'd gotten J&amp;J shot. encounter problems got Moderna shot next day. There's huge variation immune response young people old people vaccine. Old people react way less probably susceptible young population. 

I'm willing bet cases vaccine protect person completely happened mostly older folk.  vaccine ever 100% effective.

True. never expected Pfizer vaccine lose efficacy quickly. 

I'm hoping Israel's data wrong we'll see. Brave.  comment automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

2. Athletes tend hide severity illnesses injuries order keep playing Singapore's recent data starting show similar pattern. Low protection infection earlier vaccinated age bands, higher protection recently vaccinated age bands. Fortunately, Israel data, protection severe illness still strong groups.

Figs 3, 13, 14 proper study, suggest Israel data may outlier.

There couple confounders. Pfizer used exclusively earlier phase, Moderna became available mid-March. Dose intervals extended 6-8 weeks May-June, reverted July. also hard separate effects age recency 2nd dose. cynical all. case politics, also led bitterly polarized nation. dumbfounded. Trump started narrative followers blared it.100% blame Trump followers. Got Daugther mom tested. negative 
Someone Daugther school got corona time common flu school going around. Spooked us Lambda, Fuck Delta brought many times. heart issues happen naturally, folks studied scientifically rigorously found significant increase vaccinated vs unvaccinated people mRNA vaccines. J&amp;J tiny correlation.

Secondly even 1000+ cases caused directly vaccine (which case), means across 160M individuals thats rate 0.0006%. seems incredibly alarmist take tell original commenter ‚Äúprepared long-term organic damage‚Äù. Lastly cases myocarditis correlated largely treatable, sure get long term part That's really strange interpretation comment. Today first day feeling good 8 days complete hell

So science yes, public health science, rather medicinal science.    WORST thing happen, real. Happened like 12th shot two months (had get boosters everything travel, plus exotic ones). expect pain like 11 tiny little picks. common thread keep seeing amongst unvaccinated erronous belief worst happen; dying COVID-19 happens people, them.

Unfortunately, we're ""other people"" people.

Then get tragic stories dying patients begging vaccine told late die knowing could lived gotten two shots. UK lack vaccine supply took chance gave first jabs waiting second doses delivered.

Many countries administered first doses second dose hand. 

We lucky major supply hitches. AZ came online allow first doses continue Pfizer used second doses. 99.5% effective keeping people hospital/dying. Nurses maybe. Doubt 20% doctors hospital arent vaxxed.  becoming readily apparent declaring mission accomplished July 4th incorrect. 
Especially need boosters within 6 months happening summer, gonna repeat 2020 winter.

Winter Coming 2.0 I‚Äôm genuinely sarcastic, really wish world made people think like you. Paywall? I'm hopeful mRNA tech going revolutionize quick skim article, looks like including hospitalisations February, think see vaccine rate back see data misleading.

I time look expect vaccine rates quite low February, whilst covid surge quite big then, using data time say cases unvaccinated people misleading Well shit   president IOC still demanding spectators glorious prime minister considering again. least motivated let people Paralympic. British scientists talked sub months yet right? Think it‚Äôs time actually listen them. get flu vaccine never flu though get age bet take shot. Covid vaccine...yeah i'm waiting second shot week. Granted I'm home body rarely leave home, kids yeah need protection. second moderna shot 3 days ago, feel great. afraid people sore upper arm like day. left many world maps anyway! üòÅ entire dedicated it.  shot people, cant vote dead.

Shhhhh loud. Midterms right around corner. Whenever read one these, feel shellshocked people dumb. never goes away, matter many times read shit. Adult human beings thinking ""no covid, gave something else kill lie numbers"". people turn around call America best country world wave flags. saying actually true, would living absolute nightmare, horrible dystopia. makes fucking sense except say people cannot think. needed people would also normally get flu shots I‚Äôm date news, bad delta variant it‚Äôs cases doing? look like it‚Äôll keep exponentially increasing rate? I‚Äôm assuming it‚Äôs 4th July holiday, plus summer vacation that‚Äôs contributing sudden increase cases. Infected developing symptoms? 64% number infection. symptomatic infection much much higher. Darwinism work. absolute win long-term success human race. clearly America find fault China. already accused China genocide single body solid evidence prove claim. hard make false claims based insinuations. poor kid. nothing surprises anymore. ‚Äúmoderate‚Äù get thrown out? still likely get sick. vaccines still extremely effective symptomatic infection. Fair point. small study though. That's cause competent leadership began ordering vaccines. Also mainly much money US throw companies get vaccines rest world gets small amounts doses. [this latest know lot isolation. Singapore, Tawian South Korea zero Covid, managed keep control. know levels antibodies start high drop substantially,‚Äù said Prof Rob Aldridge, infectious disease epidemiologist University College London. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre concerned carry dropping rate we‚Äôve seen, protective effects vaccines start drop too, big question is, going happen?‚Äù

Honestly, far calls boosters seems abundance caution. They're yet seeing drop efficacy (maybe Israel starting hard say trial dumpster fire data unavailable) seems experts preemptively starting call boosters case immunity vaccines starts fall short. That's flase. 

Read (small) study today (they working Yale bigger study) 55% symptomatic breakthrough COVID got Long COVID. adhcdc dropped ball first time around. slow reactionary cares statistics. statistic they'll change mind. 

I love antimaskers sudden believe science cdc failed attempt motivate unvaccinated people. may end truly vaccine resistant variant brings us back square one.

Weird comment got downvoted eventual possibility naive hell people think otherwise - truly pisses anti-vax crowd: they're risking lives along own. Possibly we're still midst pandemic. wondering suppose makes sense many people possible high antibody levels virus rampant, time rely less upon brute force antibody levels Delta spreads quickly, going run anti (vax maskers) pretty quickly. stupid cousin one shot ‚Äúfear side effects‚Äù um side effects death (also side effects either shot sore arm) Fair point. reacting annual summer spike theory ‚Äî thought warmer weather associated less spread. Stupid comment. LA huge. La county 1.1 million people voted trump. enough idiots cause huge case spike. Unfortunately, think rigorous enough useful. obvious selection bias polling -- people group likely nontrivial covid outcomes, even moreso people group chose respond poll (which tiny fraction). top that, sample size symptomatic breakthroughs 44. result might right, might wrong. unfortunately methodology power say anything conclusive. Hopefully know soon. don‚Äôt wanna guy, viral infections risk severe complications. them. Covid reduced cold-like disease risk severe complications miniscule, pandemic over. makes sense me. know antibodies meant drop that‚Äôs normal response get boosters all? find lot minority groups super low vaccine uptake too. killing Republicans. Can't find insurance company cover vaccination side effect death yet, want touch Lol ever get tested antibodies? Wondering much vaccine prick arent paying attention, theres encouraging point yet are... look Texas Democrats

science dictates vaccinated people catch spread COVID

we need trust science continue masking lmao Also forget virus continue mutating countries without widespread access vaccines. Eradicating virus happen one country, needs worldwide effort effective. Traditional congregation holidays easily recognizable associated spikes lagging behind them. seen noted yet: people vaccinated, surprising cases vaccinated people even though vaccine highly effective. graph Twitter signs entrance saying masks required, receptionist staff enforce it.

Kind pointless sign, then, I'm guessing based comment 19% vaccinated area (which *insane*) honestly might 1) want deal potentially aggressive reactions, and/or 2) risk getting ton bad reviews online, hugely impact business. sound exactly like antivaxxer explain data manipulated? also doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôll get long covid. data vaccinated individuals test positive getting long covid. Best speculate. stayed home side eyed neighbors. threw mask party 40- 50 people... passed around new six week old young Covid-19 vaccine pretty much vaccines.  Bad reporting death numbers, believe. seeing reports deaths actually around 4 million. got second dose, currently sitting getting it, glad! Good luck you! made using technique Astrazeneca, outcomes similar  made using technique Astrazeneca, outcomes similar I'm India say complete lockdowns fear among people die helped stabilize situation. still going parts India though expecting another wave hit month. He‚Äôs also choosing feeling like shit expensive hospital bill vs free vaccine normalcy life. chooses former? He‚Äôs fucking idiot. travel ban early stages.  woman numbers people org, scientific seeing 50% breakthrough cases get long covid.  will. Viruses evolve virus endemic. lucky discovered mRNA make creating annual vaccines/booster much easier. 

People feel weird getting vaccine emergency authorization living dark ages.   people enjoy sick hospital simply much Texas Democrats, supposedly vaxxed still spread half group  Yes. Yes is. think school vaccines are? Govt. madates.  mean Pfizer going perform clinical trial begins August Delta-specific formulation vaccine False. data right listening much misinformation keeps getting echoed sub. school-example lie getting repeated much becomes truth. point we're better Facebook nutjobs spreading conspiracy Explain delta variant arrive usa?

It mostly indian nature 

Did Americans allow infected person without checking? Actually reason reporting b/c conditions pretty controlled. 

The miners onsite - outsiders - contact tracing simple - traced back one asymptomatic miner.  Yeah, they're already pretty badly, considering almost 100 times dying vaccinated right now, according recent data, though feel badly people get vaccinated unlucky still get hospitalized worse, actually die. 

It's one thing risk life, entirely another risk people's along you, precisely makes anti-vax crowd morally abhorrent me. think part reason reduced 12 8, research says get antibodies there's longer gap vaccines think they'll changing again. published Pitch study, researchers recruited 503 healthcare workers, 44% (223) previously Covid-19, studied immune responses generated Pfizer found short (three four-week) long (10-week) dosing intervals Pfizer vaccine generated strong antibody T-cell immune longer schedule led higher antibody levels higher proportion helper T-cells, according researchers supports immune scientists found second dose, wider gap also resulted higher neutralising antibody levels Delta variant variants concern.  True... Imagine delta without vaccines available.

Goddamn. Severe means hospitalization - weren't. 

BUT symptomatic - that's problem. Long COVID still athing.

You sick dog long hspitalized considered severe, mean long term effects tho. That's optimal. 6 weeks max time Pfizer shots. getting news Wechat social media? lot vaccine-scare crap spreading elderly Chinese online chats. Long covid symptoms may appear weeks months recovery covid infection loss smell one symptoms, think chances actually quite high.

So lets still cautious good luck dont get long covid! mixed vaccines?? First I‚Äôm hearing done.   probably much higher too... vaccinated people get tested show symptoms

I went group 50 people Kaskade SoFi... half group wearing mask... one three preemptively got tested afterwards One truthful posts ever seen reddit  Hospitalizations lag behind rise, death lags behind hospitalizations. takes see full impact. Then, hospital bill hits... would vaccinated showing symptoms reason allowed play? That's crazy. US 3 weeks. guess one thing US better countries securing vaccine supply rolling quickly. Great, provide peer-reviewed studies trials demonstrate totally made claim.

That‚Äôd especially odd considering literally vaccine ever given statistically significant issues past four months including vaccines. Again, rudimentary biochemistry, know clearly already know since fellow scientist. 

I looking forward multiple citations back well-researched (and embarrassingly ignorant bad faith attempt putting anti-vaxx trash board) claim. got Moderna. safe Delta?  I'll bet gets opportunity demonstrate position.  think children 12 minuscule amount population?? 2019 48 million children 11 under. Yep. SC school district could lose state funding attempt require masks. know cdc knows breakthrough vaccine mfg. swear see media Pfizer breakthroughs. saw video, think MSNBC. problem bunch coma-induced people apparently sleeping peacefully lots beeping machines. true horror somewhat hidden. I'm Oklahoman sending young child back school year homeschooling. I'm sorry put position. feel like witness rough months lots time home due exposure. 

As teacher, get feeling least parents district choose send kids masked? want send mine masked vaccinated sort feel like one. Actually yes you‚Äôre right. Im ashamed got vaccine hate now. Please Mr.Therapy man make feel better ;-; lmao It‚Äôs B+ masks spot solution entirely point. go quickly there's issue come easily controlled.

Some restrictions egreguous activities go that, though obviously cost more.

The problem turned measures gaining control, apart visionary places brought back need to. cases vaccinated passing unvaccinated well. send money everybody already vaccinated, like new stimulus. way avoid delay people got vaccinated first actually get money first. 30 million Californians would max cost 30 Billion $. seems pretty extreme maybe current situation need extreme measures. Spanish flu around today Become hermit bro  Nothing business, vice versa. Yet conversation COVID. telling can‚Äôt even mention vaccine without getting touchy though. bet got it, ashamed admit it. close? haha yeah. there‚Äôs literally posted article guy said would rather covid vaccine intubated government‚Äôs agenda get people vaccinated. That‚Äôs precious resources valuable time wasted terrible attitude. point, we‚Äôve tried reason compassion. there‚Äôs left mock maybe listen language America knows. culture, Trump? Death negative outcome Covid.  One first lines attack antivaxxers smart, rich people paying cut line get vaccine.

It's flawed argument multiple reasons, worked least once. efficacy measured based figures would close 80%. That‚Äôs exactly we‚Äôd expect see considering Pfizer show 88% effective preventing SYMPTOMATIC disease. add lower efficacy J&amp;J 80% right target.

The vaccines reducing infections whole bunch. people recommended get one shot (in case mRNA ones, know rest, use them), already disease wait least one month testing negative getting vaccine. However, know people still getting without issues. work hints towards vaccines even effective people real thing, I'd definitely get least shot. (If find research article, I'll edit in). Basically often immune system comes contact pathogen stronger response. Getting single shot despite sick basically ups protection simulating another infection body. reason 2 shots provide better protection single Starbucks Sunday guy behind covered sweat clearly dealing congestion. masked I‚Äôm vaccinated left didn‚Äôt want chance breakthrough. irritated someone clearly sick going out.

I‚Äôm terribly afraid getting breakthrough infection, expect mild like friend put runny nose cough four days, time I‚Äôd rather cancel week plans jerk regard others wanted cup coffee. comment automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Lol nerd pay Ambulance Air Ambulance Ontario its' emergency call transfer hospitals.  pass English/Spelling/Grammar?  definition used clinical trials, efficacy 94%.

A lot people try compare 94% trials with, example, Israeli data includes asymptomatic infections. claim much larger drop efficacy actually see. objectively wrong.  people ask vaccine hospitalized catching covid probably type people understand can't put seatbelt car crash. can't put mask baby though. daycare problem still there. sure ""common cold"" comparison coming from.

Anecdotally, heard course covid quite serious, even formally hospitalized. May involve trips ER, home oxygen, infecting people live with, fun things. pretty big fraction, perhaps third, seems get long covid symptoms quite debilitating sometimes many months, prevent working important consequences. myself, secondhand, course

""Not hospitalized"" mean ""mild."" worked giant h.m.o.

Thankfully survived made incredible recovery, terrified getting vaccine thinking she'll back hospital it. someone severe case covid, potentially caught possibility really bad again? without vaccine. even enough info reinfections make sort assumption? Important put context. Almost none vaccinated cases ending hospital. Many totally asymptomatic. 

The vaccines working exactly should. Ding ding ding!

That's correct case point gov Satan No, 88 would 9/10. That's big difference.  wear shirts pant shoes, mask, oh nooooo. Masks part families everyday wardrobe need vaccine passports documented autoimmune conditions admission hospital  [DC Public requiring masks school year.

On related note, I'm **really** glad I'm school anymore. Like, school pandemic sounds like terrible. Canada bought vaccines per capita anywhere, friend. good point, we‚Äôve created powerful new tool may allow us things weren‚Äôt possible before.

If vaccines eliminate common respiratory viruses without also requiring constant restrictions, mask mandates, public large, obviously would problem that. Yes, do. USA UK makes mistake, hurts little bit move on. Israel makes mistake, Israel anymore. believe Israel good country comes science? wish people could stop hating Israeli scientists Jewish. wish hate would come end. due hard work lives saved right now! crime prohibit mask mandates vaccines don‚Äôt reduce chance ‚Äúgetting COVID.‚Äù teach body take care gets hand

Yes, exactly. vaccines work. 

However, leaves important questions unanswered. 

* sick get enhanced immune system fights virus? 
* still shedding virus thus still pass others time? 
* likely experience ""long covid"" symptoms fight virus itself? 
* kind public health measures taking society acknowledge people vaccinated still carry virus?

As far know questions rarely asked, let alone answered. Johnson? demand proof vaccination admission hospital lol  Makes sense üëç also modified year round schedule- that‚Äôs shifted schedule back two weeks make beginning august. gives time September February breaks. Astounding. They're far touch reality feel time sit back let nature run course. make pay Nobody ever said vaccines 100% effective. Realizing mean echo chamber, means common sense half brain. Fomites v unlikely. They've seen cases delta even brief exposure gets you. Masks help much, especially they're loose. It‚Äôs frightening many Americans think ACA something separate different ‚ÄúObamacare‚Äù. reality probably would 10x sicker without vaccine. vaccine doesn‚Äôt 100% stop getting Covid. basically 99.9% stops dying. man terrible. Glad dad okay. lol kansas Let‚Äôs clear billions spent. also believe cusp cure cancer mRNA stuff one area, possibly only, hate capitalism. money go curing disease, diseases cured via pharmaceutical, excluding vaccines prevent disease, cost much it‚Äôs unbelievable.

Impossible tell bet it‚Äôs high. No, don't. vaccination 20 develop symptoms common cold, whether catch inconsequential. Seems got first two sinovac, 3rd Pfizer. guess vote confidence sinovac Pfizer available. Pfizer! mandates 100% follow approval least.

The military mandate. colleges will. Public schools start. Wait. Getting additional shots different vaccine isn‚Äôt really recommended yet. CDC &amp; FDA looking issue eventually announce guidelines boosters. J&amp;J still protective severe disease, even you‚Äôre unlucky enough breakthrough infection, almost certainly won‚Äôt end hospitalized it.

Only exception: immune compromised, please consult doctor. people category recommended boosters now. people start bombing shooting vaccination clinics, we're worse before.

This going fifth study shows Pfizer around ~80%. Redditors never ever talk ANYONE cancer society. saying that. I'm talking population confirmed cases LA, reported article. I'll sure ask next time see him. Governor's though make sure school district make mask policies though.  again, issue treating citizens like criminals need guards.

Get shot. 

Wear mask. sweet granny aged person, thank you. I've got tons masks many amusing. etsy ones face particular. cheap worth every penny. work outdoor events I'm stopping wearing around folks. Yes take I'm walking alone. Yes 0ut right back even see someone coming way I'm gonna try. issue teach, social distancing classroom. windows. know hard halls stay away people. share office three others. Gonna see do. honestly kinda now. understand course. question what's reduction number cases among vaccinated due vaccinated. I'm claiming 2/3.  link provided match numbers.

Florida:

55-64: 58%

65-74: 77%

75-84: 72%

Compare Massachusetts

50-64: 77%

65-74: 86%

Yeah curious 'conditions' met % accurate, also ""effectiveness"" means - infection symptoms. Thanks again! It‚Äôs chance, window. Haven‚Äôt actually seen full study appears vaccinated people recovering much faster unvaccinated people point countries want lower quarantine times vaccinated travelers. 

So 60% less likely get Covid, 40-50% less likely transmit get it, *and* window shortened well. dont believe this. Way much anecdotal evidence seeing lot random well known people getting it. gives flying f***. cares think? see somebody wearing mask don‚Äôt think anything. would think cautious, safe, neighborly, medical condition don‚Äôt need know about. easier study, misses people might infected never tested never showed symptoms.

In area many get tested becasue never showed symptoms. reason decide 'tough home' hope case require doctor visit diagnosis. Cause It‚Äôs game changer Exactly, don‚Äôt get wrong, get covid I‚Äôll still say that‚Äôs kind get choosing stupid way, still want recover, still someone‚Äôs loved one! mean even nurse treats ppl said thing, goes thinking, well chose this, sees sees fear can‚Äôt help feel bad them.  well known people travel lot meet people world travel lot. They're going likely gotten it, especially stopped wearing masks 2nd dose. keep wearing mask, wash hands, get booster inevitably come one fine. 4 months Canada, Qu√©bec weeks ago. Got first dose April, got second weeks ago July! long delay doses people. takes long die covid, infectious long infected, selective pressure become less deadly. Nice empathy critical thinking anecdote makes feel like numbers make sense.

East Tennessee, though could stated places country. system absolutely strained, held (again, exceptions hospitals actually get run).

The vaccine would help ensure problems would protect whatever variants come out. Right likely strong degree protection, could stronger last longer vaccine. Yeah, phizer much anything gf.

It means 12% vaccinated people contract virus compared non-vaccinated population

In words, two populations 500 people each, one group vaccinated group control, control group 100 people got covid, expect 12 500 vaccinated group contract disease.  think take years push US. transition endemic virus might par flu every year. way see it, probably need slightly better vaccines start giving babies like MMR really push here. like measles though take advantage drops vaccination rates produce new outbreaks. Delta dominant strain Sweden weeks now, places (e.g. Stockholm) pretty much completely taken people allowed participate? complete madness, guaranteed they're going cause superspreader event; one could easily avoided too. Um, yeah? can't get infected transmission Well good overcoming fear. he's days death, regrets everything said.

This said, wrong. offers 91% protection infection spread. semantics, made basic incorrect statement. Jesus Christ, sounds like beginning PR disaster IOC   Finally, accurate response. Thank  coworker still much taste smell back got October 2020.  positive cases paint real picture.

Most sick people vaccinated.
Unfuckingbelievable Maddening hell. Impossible discussion people don‚Äôt use logic. agree you. held load 10 minutes there, champ. seems case. Breakthrough infections smaller viral load appear less contagious based current data. Coronaviruses (the general class viruses) eliminated like smallpox animal reservoirs, could well eliminate COVID. slow mutating effective set vaccines. main reason see lots mutations right explosive growth, due instability covid genome.

There good chance vaccinate world quick enough, get mess COVID zero. said ""being vaccinated actually protect getting seriously ill COVID"" 100% protection, would labeled misleading. apologize. read too. Twice. I've felt miserable ever since. Literally nothing stopping Yet again, Israeli government making bold declarations without actually releasing data along methodology, releasing useless inconsistent data confirm anything. really isnt N95s anywhere near useless without fit test. thought might go 85% 90% effectiveness without perfect fit, far exceeds silly cloth masks do.

And they're cheap enough disposable, yes. True, doctor know sure.

Am safe?  article thread reposted Monica Gandhi regarding restricted evolutionary diversity covid vaccines. Ie mutation occurring vaccinated individuals infected far less likely. yet believe numbers something like 43 vaccinated deaths 9,000 overall deaths since February. look since May people could get vaccinated, there‚Äôs roughly 2,500 deaths.

And thanks one thing: Vaccines. 75% adults received least one shot almost 50% fully vaccinated. Uptake among 60+ 90%. pace still high yet another month vaccinate schools open again, additional time takes time new wave become big.

Also, population density bad explanation says little people actually live. That's basically correlation population density deaths international scale. virus thrives groups people spend large amounts time indoors.

The numbers good Delta, know. 
 
Efficacy overall reduction chance. like saying live Antarctica 99% less likely die collision highway. necessarily mean safest driver, means exposure risk reduced. 
 
If went back home Los Angeles drove meet friend across town, suddenly chances dying traffic accident way higher. exposure level changed. That's high case load un-distanced behavior 
 
The meat potatoes vaccines apparent ability shake infection first place. expose enough, like going night clubs questionable screening process, absolutely still contract it. 
So important know vaccinated people still get hurt even die COVID. 
 
----- 
 
Think way: staying home vaccine rollout, practically never saw anyone - chance dying minuscule.  
If got fully vaccinated (-90% chance infected, 1/10 chance now) went **12x** often use - net exposed staying home. 
 
The whole point vaccine enough us got it, stacked 90% reduction transmission would bring case numbers far *anyone's* chance contracting impossibly low even regardless vaccination status. 
 
Delta thrown wrench process. almost effective herd immunity vaccinating did, ~50% simply enough. vaccinated people risk well. 
The big difference vaccinated people slower growth curve cases hospitalizations, chances severe disease ~half.

False, one county Mandate, others recommend  88% what? single exposure? day, month, lifetime? understand sentiment, reminder US, children &lt;12 years old immunocompromised adults cannot get vaccinated. ‚Äúthey chance protect themselves‚Äù isn‚Äôt *quite* reality.  suppose works Disney wORLd said. US many going bad half country boneheaded take free lifesaving tonic gods. Guessing Finland would buy easy logistics tad complicated basic trip Wal-Mart. Yup, hurt less weak pinch baby. reward people getting vaccinated punishment getting vaccinated.

Otherwise shit changing.

These people fucking dense.   Never. anyone seen studies regarding period elapsed time full vaccination (i.e., final shot plus 2 weeks) onset breakthrough infection? would think breakthroughs would seen among recently completed vaccinations. However, breakthroughs primarily first vaccinated early year, might indicate greater need booster shots 6-10 months following final ""first round"" completion. Yea countries except French territory St. Pierre &amp; Miquelon basically come 9th curious go, see incentive I‚Äôm hearing lot vaccinated people getting COVID, I‚Äôm also hearing studies show vaccines highly effective Delta Variant. Seems conflicting information I‚Äôm confused oh well. suppose start wearing mask shopping again. Low vaccination state especially young kids reasons reorder k95s bet prices rising again.

I notice getting sniffles slight cold pretty much immediately unmasking. get colds 4 5 years.

So unmasked might help immune system via exposure viruses bugs year isolating. relish getting kid sick etc .Maybe go roll dirt instead lol. vaccinated. Readily available States. 12% Australia vaccinated due lack supply, that's ""first world"". many countries experiencing peak infection rates.

And course US full idiots even perfect supply 56% vaccinated, barely enough slow spread except high-compliance pockets. nobody wearing masks quarantine ""over"", we're everything help Covid infect people.

Yes, *could have* done more, sooner. didn't. didn't. said least 6 months, data available said it. Completely false. much lower vaccine hesitancy NZ US Europe. People keen vaccinated. low rate mass vaccine rollout begin August population eligible October. misinformed. think need it, lots people desperate vaccinated. issue vaccines, there's supply issues. 3 cities currently dealing outbreaks, pretty obvious need them. Republicans. I'm shocked. felt like got run truck, 24h after, fine mean‚Ä¶you involves something known lying, lol. mean you‚Äôre sort taking side effects risks hands isn‚Äôt necessarily great idea either. real concern whether autoimmune side effects likely booster. it‚Äôs significantly likely weigh likely relatively mild covid course risk. 

Hopefully get real data soon That‚Äôs true, it‚Äôs also true vaccine offers 100 percent protection symptomatic disease, people vaccinated, chances breakthrough infection. would still less infection spread nobody vaccinated, though.

Symptoms mild lose sense taste / smell Sounds cool me, especially frustration anxiety beginning. boof pfizer shots? mean, that's technically correct except ""inducing illness"" part. that's ""best"" kind lie -- mixed truth.

And vaccine sense vaccine does, even traditional live/attenuated virus vaccine. Cases might remain high, thanks vaccines, they're going much, *much* less severe. second dose sickest I‚Äôve ever felt worries. guy nation‚Äôs dumbest politician. get stuff home supermarket walk there? findings suggest:  

 short long dosing intervals Pfizer vaccine generated strong immune responses overall  

 three-week schedule generated fewer neutralising antibodies bind virus stop infecting cells 10-week interval  

 antibody levels dipped first dose, levels T-cells - different type immune cell - remained high  

 longer schedule led fewer T-cells overall higher proportion specific type subset, called helper T-cells, according researchers, supports immune memory There's Canadian study partial results Moderna showing strongly Delta, even one dose. 

Not surprising, since practically identical Pfizer dosed 3x volume. reminder takes like 2 weeks reach full immunity 4 weeks mask wearing.  WTF. US make many vaccines go bad storage. country needs buy more. plenty probably give away. Since health insurance companies care ethics? subjecting \*easily preventable disease\* choice. They'll happy send bill full approval comes through.

Hell, remember insurance tried bill full hospital fee exactly doctors told do. ended getting dropped course did, let's honest here- hate paying especially ""not medically necessary"". Israel uses 3 weeks interval UK Canada use longer interval 8 weeks)
 
longer interval associated higher neutralizing antibody due longer affinity maturation process.. sucks, sounds like you‚Äôre faring well. It‚Äôs actually pretty cool get living evidence well vaccines work! funny, simple walk supermarket exposes 100+ people alone Canada, too. hit excess supply week two ago. Big Shield fan eh? mainly red dead states alpha wild variant could prevent 90% deaths first dose. give 12 weeks instead 3 weeks apart 50%-100% people vaccinated (germany managed ~2% per week difference 2-6% general population least one dose) least everyone fully vaccinated amount doses. delta healthcare perspective first dose needed.

Germany 6 weeks Biontech reduced time 3 weeks supply sufficient now. AZ 12 weeks 3 weeks. Source? New Zealand low vaccination rate vaccination roll extremely slow, seen many articles people frustrated get appointment, seen article people refusing avoiding vaccine. Yeah mom got bad muscle aches cramps basically forced stay bed two days fine. Pfizer shot basically gave mild fever bad headache fatigue. one on? Gilenya basically killed immune response. I'm thinking going rogue trying get third shot without approval. sure delta variant? heard loss smell prevalent delta alpha. Depends are. places done 4 weeks, I‚Äôve trying get mine 8 weeks still another 2 weeks away, they‚Äôve refused here.  like thinking wait till house burns get fire insurance. fine/imprison people eat vegetables! idea long lasts, vaccines widespread use less year, we‚Äôre still gathering data. It‚Äôs probably dependent individual though. Without knowing large efficient manufacturer‚Äôs lipid delivery system can‚Äôt compare micrograms.

I wouldn‚Äôt assume you‚Äôre really making 3X spike protein Moderna Yay!   Why's china afraid guilty üòï also got lucky timing Delta. started spread finished first dose roll started second doses. came month earlier could UK's situation.

That said first shot rollout right choice either way happens try get two, Pfizer Moderna, lol I‚Äôve seen many different percentages don‚Äôt even know believe. 70% thought that‚Äôs good! Data Israel shown immunity infection might even better immunity vaccination

The way look messaging various health experts like getting similar different advice doctors medical question. going say ""well, *ideally*, would this, but..."" others going hard line recommendations. science vaccine efficacy strong. repeated leading voices largely ""pandemic unvaccinated"" data bears out. Post-vaccine morale high. Remain cautious wish, surprised many us follow suit. Whoa, whoa. Easy, Frank Fontaine. add excellent explanation, let‚Äôs say 100 people group X unvaccinated people get infected, could expect 12 people get infected group X vaccinated people (88% less). bonus, 12 would highly protected severe infection death. likely incorrect. Vaccinated people much less likely spread virus (in general) much lower viral load. people vaccinated, less people actually spread it. paper says viral load similar symptomatic asymptomatic patients? catching surviving breakthrough infection serve booster existing immunity arising vaccines?  would even effective asymptomatic infection theory.

Asymptomatic = smaller exposure = smaller viral load

I'm scientists, getting shot regardless heavily protect anyone else severe illness least countries supply.

In UK, said ‚Äúone shot appears give decent protection severe infection, reduce death focusing getting first doses first necessitates bigger interval. haven‚Äôt explicitly tested bigger interval, everything know vaccines usually work would suggest longer interval probably won‚Äôt significantly hurt immunity actually likely help little.‚Äù

I'm curious know formula tweaking going production lines still churning original formula.  prepared lock away years, possibly whole life, SARS-CoV-2 isn‚Äôt going away anytime soon.  5 US athletes already got COVID dropped out, games even officially started Wait mandatory athletes fully vaccinated going there? Well that's gonna shitshow pretty quickly. Merkel always said vaccines aren‚Äôt mandatory got first dose Pfizer vaccine yesterday it‚Äôs really rough. Can‚Äôt sleep, stomach aches, runny nose, arm killing new. Also dizzy headache. wish would told us side affects could severe. could barely drive home, working today difficult. we're going start enacting restrictions mild asymptomatic spread among vaccinated, hope people understand means we'll forever. 

Vaccinated people getting covid rest lives. Almost fine, almost none burden medical system. Muh freedom /s Funnily enough though many Olympic-standard athletes *aren't* great health. They're physically fit (depending sport) actually come expense underlying health. Steroids/drugs (let's honest, majority something) also play part

Many elite calibre athletes chronically overtrained. get ""supplements"" (i.e. steroids/other PEDs) maintain performance - ironically, performance peaks point system overtrained.

Quite could risk complications covid suspect. Especially given number African Americans squad    Well 5 million people dead mean Pfizer able optimize mRNA better? Wow...nothing wrong gonna happen that...no sir... Especially people read headlines. studies ""immunity vaccine lasts six months""

That's unfortunate phrasing science-paper dogma. said ""at least six months"", comments /r/COVID19 confirm.

I've seen anything like 15% protection, link?  think anyone give damn guidance gatherings then. Hell, care *now*. got vaccine! side effects all. exposed covid twice never caught it! idea variant I'm glad trial! Something statement feels like oxymoron. acquaintance high school, 30, thin, healthy, pregnant, chose get vaccinated, genuinely believing would best baby put off. put ventilator doctors discussing delivering baby 28 weeks. anyone worried might affect pregnancy, evidence vaccine impacts pregnancy negative way, *promise* vent worse.  reaction probably nicest thing that's going happen today, thank you, best wishes friend. viral vector similar typically much less effective.

Yeah thousand athletes really enough spark new variant, unlike us UK going full monty  parents‚Äô defense: public health messaging risk children good. people seem think risk much higher really is. Ok, considering mentioned headline, point? I‚Äôm legitimately confused. rephrase, think concerned whether hit hospital capacity (seems unlikely‚Äîeven based new modeling) whether large surge deaths among vaccinated ineligible vaccine.

The unvaccinated aren‚Äôt worried survival don‚Äôt want society bend backwards them. Let‚Äôs give want. swear we‚Äôre stupidest nation earth. modern coliseum would entertaining thing since original .. 1v1 gun draw thing, weapons death, Mexican standoff, like 1 dude gun vs 100 swords That‚Äôs everyone needs get vaccinated. may get won‚Äôt die.

That end it. Get boosters approved now!  sad.

Also, respect, many athletes poor educational backgrounds (to blunt) intelligent people around. understand reasons vaccinate and/or scared process.

If parents want take additional precautions them, means absolutely should. Paralympics separate event, usually Olympics.

Paralympians don‚Äôt attend Olympics. Scenario A: choose get vaccinated risk getting covid change.

Scenario B: choose get vaccinated risk getting covid drastically decreases.

At point, I'm tempted argue people choose get vaccinated actively suicidal. trend Missouri #4 new infections deaths US right ya'll need get vaccinated.

Most states well road 70%+ vaccinated. team player help us get goal line Missouri. still concerned too, unvaccinated people still filling hospital beds. ICUs metro area starting fill again. patients burden doctors nurses. Also, doctors nurses mental health suffering continued pandemic crisis. going burn out. Many hospitals already seeing mass exodus vaccines 100% effective. Remember, clinical trial circumstances, Pfizer/Moderna 95% effective J&amp;J 60%. slightly less effective variants like delta. seeing vaccine breakthrough cases. I've even seen cases fully vaccinated people die COVID. Someone fall percentage vaccine failure higher community prevalence virus is, people see fully vaccinated getting Unvaccinated people continued transmission virus basically create variant factories. Eventually virus continues spread, mutate unpredictable ways become deadly evade vaccines currently People immunocompromised often form antibodies getting vaccinated thus protected. I'm transplant patient produce antibodies getting vaccinated. basically protection getting COVID could kill me. would also include cancer patients, HIV patients, MS, basically anyone else severely weakened immune Children 12 cannot get vaccinated. serious health impacts COVID kids rare, happens devastating kids families. Long haul COVID impacting adults. recall one particularly heartbreaking case young girl whose passion dancing becoming infected COVID, lungs heart damaged severely cannot dance level work older people, amount people getting vaccine ridiculous. put everyone risk so. Yea idk whats big deal wearing masks

In country gotta wear double masks going outside even wear running barely noticeable like Mexico.

American south still speaks English pockets highly developed, multiracial prosperous areas I‚Äôm glad time money it. Shows trust clickbait media. vaccines work. Freedom day worked. Matthew 21:12 ? Depends strategy moving forward. go elimination strategy - partnership countries around world, they'll to.

Depending variants emerging - may safest thing do. cards table. Well lot less likely get it.

But certainly mean 0% chance getting it. That's unfortunate. days second dose Pfizer hope best. 

May ask engage strenuous activities 3‚Äì7 days past vaccination? symptoms get? hospitalized and/or fully recovered now? That's bad. Someone deleted comment said schools open without masks etc. sure true Delta dominant strain now. hundreds ways get food outside going store. Super tired articles. completely expected. Nobody ever claimed 100% effectiveness. vaccine provides 100% effectiveness. Everybody‚Äôs getting patriot cough claim scientist? CDC real world data literally says safe vaccinated, extra measure added protection. Vaccines available US months uptake still increasing. People want know endgame, happily comply, public health messaging failing constantly nobody knows goal is.

Do work in-person 8 hours day mask on? work gym mask stay fit? year, don‚Äôt complain, makes half daily life way difficult knowing don‚Äôt need wear one.

Entertainment venues, concerts, gyms lose customers mask mandates, like started LA. Saying ‚Äúit‚Äôs piece cloth‚Äù isn‚Äôt answer issues. said mandate would work make sure unvaccinated complied. toilet paper even this? care happens everybody. matter young old, athlete work McDonald's, one deserves die covid. necessarily them, people give to, fact event could cause spike covid infections Japan, brought back home. fact finally starting get underconrol, event could infect thousands. believe Moderna showed slightly nabs cell activity recent lab neutralization study both, little separation first dose. Maybe believe you‚Äôre going give 1 dose booster, might well one produces robust response first dose? Or, they‚Äôre mad Pfizer? 

Note: didn‚Äôt read article, don‚Äôt know it‚Äôs clearly stated they‚Äôre switching. randomly got Corona in-between severe post effects, much longer away might even quit permanent lung damage example. Makes sense noted, seen people misread well, recommendation. mandate. Still people need follow public health advice get vaccinated asap recommendation. think one worrying issues covid time moves see long term issues. it‚Äôs micro-vascular disease don‚Äôt know future brings. kidney lung failures alone lifelong health issues. Long haul covid real thing. People needing oxygen support months afterwards. think people risking futures matter mild case is. talking decades medical investigation exactly attacks body long term effects be. I‚Äôm afraid looking life long disabilities people complications raise risk dying early. I'm going trouble, might well wear mask works. bad don‚Äôt start school earlier example follow Worldometers used daily data county. anyone know that's easily accessible, preferably graphs? ages 2-11, Pfizer plans file EUA towards end Sept, means Oct. approval; placing solidly fall. 

For &lt;2 Pfizer looking November EUA filing positioning Dec. release. like I'm reading uncle's facebook posts!   Jeez, 2.2% mortality rate vaxxed individuals. flu 0.05% mortality rate, would mean covid kills 45 people every single flu death. pharmacy department yes, lot Safeways near pharmacy that's got vaccinated. walked soon heard available. different get flu shot. lot athletes dumb Since always..... lol cloth masks protective. Better nothing obviously. think it‚Äôs gonna gradual time things going care don‚Äôt. Nothing major develop tamiflu type treatment. Imo 100% normal. basically every business changed requirements form ""mask required enter"" ""show us smile vaccinated"".

So end nobody wearing one.

At least could get chunk unvaccinated wear mask. none. pointing lack health insurance may correlated, utterly irrelevant getting vaccinated, since pocket costs strictly banned regardless. think accomplish telling unvaccinated people stay home? basis this? XFitt 4 5 days week got Covid. took months. got bonus prize blood clot. caused large DVT. damage arteries, veins nerves leg. Oh. blood thinners rest life. job, hobbies alone sidelined me. Never mind getting back prior infection harder. bull shit Olympic athletes suffer harm virus. Happy Cake Day? let woman run smoked weed... Please refrain spamming comment repeatedly. predict large scale shut downs happen again. Life never again.  That's correct. Hopefully looked into. article say however seems clots rare, mostly occur people cardiovascular diseases, 80% people got survived. That's pretty reassuring, thanks posting it! Eventually people enough revolt. Constantly locking unsustainable, especially vaccine available anyone wants one. directly answer question, like website's short sweet coverage Covid topics article long ago, tangentially related. Delta seems replicate absolutely crazy numbers inside body, meaning quicker positivity tests, asstons shedding, less interactive time positive person get infected, likely overwhelm weak line defense like single-shot maybe natural antibodies prior strain. saw mention somewhere study showed delta able overwhelm natural antibodies petri dish study, still working real-world study.

I envy anyone kids right now, hard play balancing act safety sanity.  also one Singapore published shoulder ached day half second shot, mild flu symptoms really ""bleh"" feeling cold. I'm 26 certainly peak physical health like athlete fine. none games follow novels story IIRC Sure, allow vaccinated people go maskless unvaccinated people lie.   dunno, made tons computer games, least half actually good. incorrect don‚Äôt even know begin True probably think ‚Äúdo I‚Äôve since covid get after‚Äù

Then mean 83% vaccinated I‚Äôm guessing half rest get half won‚Äôt. go well? Okay.

I glad time money that. Sounds dumb least rhymes. obviously don‚Äôt live Illinois. Liberals vote matter candidate beyond brainwashed union teachers Ding ding....the market bleeding. get people sick die. Japanese citizens want Olympics. confusing ""won't"" ""can't."" Enjoy never-ending pandemic thing keeps mutating people keep making excuses live instead demanding action people taxes pay public servants. Read whole comment

This enforced county city authority. Low vaxx areas ignoring completely. High vaxx areas *mostly* following rules. Although there's huge decrease compliance even liberal areas. 

So going jack shit anyone # GOTTEM testimonials scaring more.. believe it‚Äôs matter time vaccinated people start showing symptoms.. allow remain chance mutating spreading advanced age. always forget mention that. Yeah, current guidance everyone follow local health guidance (masking, etc). Honestly, fuck yeah, let‚Äôs rack body count rate. don‚Äôt care us, care them? feel like nurses issue. That‚Äôs group Facebook. doctors 4 7 year old children. wonder turn out? anybody tell happens unvaccinated people pandemic hotspot? curious. almost like know something whole bunch people know. seems problem? Everyone got vax safe right? shouldn‚Äôt matter many without it. People afraid already jab COVID extremely low risk children. position risk children unacceptable, would support nationwide 25 mph speed limit? would save lot lives.

How nationwide ban allowing kids swim? Make forbidden kids go pools go beach. would surely save lot children's lives. could also install high fencing river acess make sure kid get water drown. 

Society always accepted certain level risk. covid idea risk acceptable. 

If going take COVID though, wearing masks forever. risk isnt going go away, ever. lot depends much virus introduced (viral load). guess we‚Äôll get see real world test vaccines fall there‚Äôs massive community spread starting happen areas delta. careful üòä Right. give 80%+ chance avoiding infection getting vaccine don‚Äôt risk sick tough situation hate careless people jeopardize others. :/  Decreased Pfizer/BioNTech deliveries?

EU paid extra get Q3 doses moved Q2 Blame dipshits getting vaccine. endgame. Get people vaccinated. problem load fucking morons it.

So half US refusing get vaccinated tell vaccinated people wear mask unvaccinated people lie it.

So either need start requiring vaccines meaningful way require everyone wear mask can't lie vaccinated go without. Thank duck husband's office run ppl sense. 

Everyone end month clear personal belongings. office going scheduled hoteling style. team needs come meet days project? That's cool, gotta schedule still space distancing. space used gets sanitized daily.  you‚Äôre poor country. wonder Americans, Brits, EU know every immigrant enters country need full vaccination record? still requires person check enforce it. going grocery store, 15yo bagger?

You're guy, pal think meant respond executive-time? Oh wow even played Rainbow Six games, guess play one reflected story. maybe never even played story mode? blur point lol wife pregnant she‚Äôs really reluctant take vaccine long term studies fetuses. 

She says don‚Äôt know sort mental disease show baby two years now. However understands danger she‚Äôs right she‚Äôs higher risk pregnancy. It‚Äôs obviously personal choice parents fine it, I‚Äôd fine it.

At age 70, it‚Äôs reasonable say won‚Äôt around much longer. Losing year covid already huge percentage remaining lives. You‚Äôve taken reasonable precautions, gotten vaccinated, wear masks. don‚Äôt see covid going completely away anytime soon, parents, I‚Äôd want enjoy time while
I can, also knowing mobility could get worse next 5-10 years. Florida reports numbers permanent residents really need measure fine detail asked ""hey please wear mask public short vaccine approved use ages""?  There's also old saying says two better one Odd, everyone insisted deaths unlinked cases True, sometimes burden think. Video game fans rabid anything like deviation games causes boycotts shit. movie producer guess might steer away anything video game related. could also wrap entire athlete plastic prevent infecting others   I'm /u/bellizabeth.

I want people wear masks vaccine actually obtainable anyone. two kids 12 I'd like get vaccinated.

I would ok mask mandates unvaccinated people only, people lie. way get even **some** people wear mask ask everyone wear mask.  always heard natural immunity still inferior vaccines variants, people previously covid still get vaccinated.  really sugar that's messed  Yes, I‚Äôve checked record there. It‚Äôs got COVID info also things like rabies shot got five years ago, yearly flu shots, etc., anything I‚Äôve gotten since moving state. already pointed could see vaccinations records original comment.

I would hope state went passports would get ironed out, though I‚Äôm sure states top others. Medical professionals already rely Immunet here, clearly done even everyone scrambling vaccine left things bit disarray. sites dropping ball getting people uploaded within 24 hours need serious auditing. LPN RN programs require 4 year degree prior starting program. Nursing technical skill, memorize things make programs pass state tests. I'm saying easy, high bar. hard find nurse dumb overconfident.

 appreciate nurses, time many seem anti-vax MLMs, instills zero confidence. might right thinking, know what's even worse medal chances? event cancelled someone else got sick. 

I understand IOC make requirement. take vaccine, can't compete don't. Pretty sure isn‚Äôt deep them. Also probably think even get vaccinated still test positive miss chance. Pfizer recommends 21 days. trials set up. They're still plenty people working there, getting to/from airport plus you'te bringing people together sending home again. So? What‚Äôs point discussion? 6 months eh‚Ä¶   cant get vaxed. die yet? No? news? unless deaths hospitalizations start spike dont anything worry about....yet. Yeah, would need see source one Japan even really military nevermind nukes. Made worse countries taking context statement mixing vaccine doses, declaring different doses insufficiently vaccinated.  Vaccinations. Masks irrelevant post-vaccine world. prob would started collapsing hospitals. That's pickle. think wore masks, avoided crowded places practiced good hygiene fine. need ask spend whole trip worrying? so, maybe consider going somewhere else, relaxation trip. Canada opening soon. Maybe talk going north instead?  Let lie then. They're ones reaping consequences. find athletes vaccinated cheer them?  32 Percent citizens Yep SIL got vaccines end 2nd trimester/start 3rd baby fine. mean there's spectators athletes allowed leave village think putting mask vaccinated person, without strict distancing efficacy whatsoever?

No, think ask everyone wear masks unvaccinated lie. Yeah suppose that's true! agree think could've made work (many did), athletes events going back months. E.g. [a Cole Hocker unvaccinated although previously state Oregon rolled vaccines general population May 1st. regionals May 26-29, nationals June 9-12, Olympic trials June 24-27. fairly successful video game series there's least.  Perhaps, I'm afraid magnifying doubt data shows avoid political hurts compliance people vaccinations,‚Äù said. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre saying public vaccines work less, hurts enthusiasm them.‚Äù He‚Äôs bright. statement could easily come back haunt him, should. counter matter test positive won‚Äôt compete doesn‚Äôt matter vaccinated still test positive. Forget physically able compete - even *allowed* compete test positive shortly event?? Require masks vaccination optional events? 50 kind young tho. Source: nearing 50 say player responsible, says team unvaxxed player responsible. reading right?

You read correctly. exaggerating financial responsibility is. team get paid there's cancelation due unvaccinated player team. would nice additional fines docking salary.

There also peer pressure effect. vaccinated players, paid, blame unvaccinated player responsible, may lead greater pressure teammates vaccinate anything stupid happens. live USA.

These people choosing get vaccinated choosing die spread virus.

These people attempted coup 7 months ago, told us past 16 months COVID lie, murdered front line workers enforcing mask mandates, people cheered covid ravaged cities, people ""Pro-Choice"" long choice vaccine.

These people absolutely horrible; deal them. OP clearly has, family - hell one died Covid. 

They STILL get vaccinated actually blame ambulance ride cause... Another member died month covid well; mention funeral - ""mysterious"" death.

Your point contradictory said talking ""shorter time line immunity"" patently untrue. timeline immunity still strong ever - thus 4 months 4 decades. said ""88% 4 months"" shows idea keyword ***variant*** indicates, thus comments. variant appears five years now, five days now, lower efficacy vaccine never built it; because... word...

Yes! I've saying exactly past couple weeks people started calling mandates imposed again. Unless coupled large scale mitigation measures, wearing mask grocery symbolic, performative move ""spread prevention"" measure.

The way see it, vaccinated still virus-wary, continue hunker down. vaccinated comfortable ""re-entry"" mask wearing really necessary. unvaccinated wearing mask (unless rare individual cannot medical reasons receive jabs), hell doing? unvaccinated give fucks, then, well, either. think joke :) I'm sure think I'm arguing Olympics safe event something. think I'm worried situation. Sounds like least 100 likely test positive Covid point, given highly contagious variants are. better term would ""misinformed"". fact, requires intelligence self-delude mental gymnastics. also aware win public calls keep opinions themselves.

There's reason racists almost never call racist instead go another term ""race realist"". Thank you! I'll look need again. welcome news baffling way. commentary suggested exponential growth getting started, yet case numbers fell consistently four days.

We opened week means might start rise couple weeks symptoms manifest. Let's pray that; high numbers cause concern lot protection now, low case numbers still better.  Real world *measured* efficacy vaccines US least going fall next 3 6 months indistinguishable unvaccinated, reasons everyone talking about.

Natural immunity going rise rapidly Delta. Natural immunity, several articles posted sub, par vaccination effectiveness COVID. majority unvaccinated infected recovered, we'll see terrible-looking effectiveness statistics vaccinations we'll comparing one mostly immune population another. real context time, cases, hospitalizations deaths floor.  Better person can‚Äôt detect obvious sarcasm. right, vaccines still good protection worst effects disease. people go get haven't.

That said, kind data suggests things like masking may even vaccinated. 2.7% mortality rate breakthrough cases terrifying, data I've seeing manages spread even vaccinated populations, bad is, numbers turn VASTLY grim unvaccinated. also none business vaccinated isn't? Problem is, CDC's AAP's current guidelines regarding school policies contradict other. former allows vaccinated students forego masks, latter doesn't.

I think somewhere along road, even CDC roll back guidance allowing vaccinated people go maskless, roll back later extension guidance schools. I'm rolling eyes hard dramatic comments masks-- even thread. cystic fibrosis main takeaway get subreddit healthy people whiny lol. mean simple using app scanning QR code. argument could made ""who's gonna enforce mask mandates""  one shot still excellent protection. You‚Äôre gonna fine - contract, like second shot.

Not doctor, obviously vigilant health quarantine! need panic.

You likely weren‚Äôt exposed enough viral load overcome first shot, vaccine protect you, still get symptoms mild. Wishing best! really think medical ethicists need rethink Hippocratic oath. closing hospitals people wildly refused vaccine point.

It something lightly, telling people medical community considers pariah may cause rethink things bit, would benefit everyone. that's point. local ordinance says otherwise. currently normal moment? Rainbow Six. fun. need understand never going happen. Vaccinated people going getting covid rest life. die. reality even incredibly unlikely scenario reach 80% vaccinated.  exponential growth slowing weeks got close 0% decrease still surprising, going trends expecting 3 weeks peak. lot confounding situational changes recently though mess nice exponential curves :) add, ""back normal"" mentality prevalent summer *much* stronger preceding summer.

You wanna know why? magic word beginning ""v"". think Indiana 1.6/1.7% however 91% deaths 71+ 

I'm sure buy breakthrough case numbers obviously going need monitored part, people live whole lives without going club restaurant. 

It‚Äôs hard go grocery store. Another anecdote: friend fully vaccinated got covid weeks ago lost smell/taste days. guarantee. That's anyone saying. anyone saying guarantee, factitious.  helping 2020 vote recount... soon call good news - per second sentence soon say cases peaked, however, given statistics capture impact unlocking happened 19 July.

Definitely hope best, data comes - know we've seen peak wave. depends are. I've lived + worked cities Japan I've also done village around thousand people, villages surrounded beautiful mountains greenery (until fall became ocean red orange). definitely country. Really, Japan's packed country - painted way movies media. Sure, cities definitely full life people, countryside still much countryside. many villages, example, warned go walking isolated areas risk attacked wild boars animals. happen countries wall wall people. used go skiing Nagano (some best skiing world, IMHO) man, mountain, mountain, meaning feel like nature nowhere near city! (Yes, easy runs accessible runs busy, doubt, that's true country even decent skiing). regions absolutely impose new restrictions.

But don‚Äôt think need one-size-fits-all approach. Vermont, example, different situation Missouri. 10400 people stadium today.

Aren't Olympic stadiums closed spectators time around?   Oh! Thanks correction understand. That's somehow even stupider could worse variants already spreading won‚Äôt find weeks vaccines could enough allow society live virus.

You're right. We're going die species. mean? experts mentioned article seem believe Israel data faulty. problems aren‚Äôt vaccine, data,‚Äù

research well vaccine prevents infection. Sure, breakthrough cases newsworthy, rarely discussed enough detail put perspective. Vaccinated people far, far better unvaccinated people age group. it‚Äôs still case vaccinated 70-year old higher rate infection unvaccinated 30-year old. So, ability vaccine keep older people hospital extremely important.

I honestly think US go back sort lockdowns unless Delta (or another variant) starts killing large numbers children, something else similarly shocking. simple facts this: areas vaccination lowest going get hit hardest, also (mostly) areas least likely impose new mandates. politicized probably ain't changing. clear, I'm taking anti-lockdown stance anything, stating reality seeing it... vax mask/lockdown likely lot overlap.

* masking order came effect July 22, keeping existing restrictions place.

* restrictions added Aug 2 Aug 5.

The study made analysis covering July 10 Aug 10. Without reading more, looks though section time compare set restrictions, set restrictions plus mask mandate. think Gamma (The Variant Formerly Known Brazil Variant) going issue would happened now. around long time point.

Resume domestic travel refrain testing travel self-quarantine travel 
Refrain testing leaving United States international travel (unless required destination) refrain self-quarantine arriving back United States 
Refrain testing following known exposure, asymptomatic, exceptions specific settings 
Refrain quarantine following known exposure asymptomatic 
Refrain routine screening testing feasible 
For now, fully vaccinated people continue to: 
 
Get tested experiencing COVID-19 symptoms

So basically, attainable goal. say okay let become endemic, long cases stay low. impossible let go endemic, eventually spread like crazy around population.

So, opinion, goal wait covid-19 learns co-exist society, clearly incapable afraid co-exist virus. Yeah that‚Äôs true, things listed Covid symptoms CDC least year. Right would happy way prevent state governments restricting local governments businesses taking precautions. Like, keep DeSantis (Florida governor) forbidding proof vaccine requirements private businesses want enact them, prevent Kemp (my governor Georgia) prohibiting local governments putting place mask mandates feel need to.

But federal government can't restrict state government rights, least via fiat.  USA...home surprising statistics. ü§î said thing last year start pandemic. Saying stuff like ""We California, never mask lockdown."" couple weeks later masking restrictions kicking in.

He promise whatever wants now, fact still enough unvaccinated people overload medical system. part florida, hospitals seeing many patients worst spike far. 

I surprised see backtracking allowing local mandates continue along trajectory. I‚Äôm 18 quality life greatly diminished covid. Speak Wow I‚Äôm surprised isn‚Äôt mandatory. long term solution vaccine mandates passports US starting vaccinations like March April general public. Plus likely could gotten ealier/special treatment olympians. vaccinated people UK received Pfizer. People need understand point vaccine always reduce serious outcomes, outright prevent people catching covid Also respectfully, 6% jobs huge portion workforce.  surprise me? said before, scientist advised studied CDC - specifically regarding pandemic events bioterrorism responses - entirely inept. made strides forming pandemic response team, Trump fired 2018, honest kind poor job past year. course, massive obstacles really uneducated, dumb public cooperating... fact head CDC questioning mask usage point beyond ridiculous. thing yet public stupidity, certainly great job. I'd give C-, passing grade lets honest, stars private industry. ones getting us thing scientists made vaccines. problem public general know listen default trust CDC... us scientists, often information (somehow) better understanding situation people center fed information... inept/weak scientists, IMO. hard bring up, fact pandemic, actually need people trust them. kind hurt conspiracy nutjobs latch mistakes legitimately made throughout past year, albeit usually minor things caused outside forces like executive branch time. need vaccine infants well ASAP! dangerous virus.  hope throat eventually came back earth. wish articles like would recommend (or least mention) N95 better options. Early last year using anything could get, better masks readily available now. go out, I'm mostly still seeing people wearing cheap cloth masks. Again, better nothing, could much better now. polite way telling wrong. kids don‚Äôt think childhood ruined üòÇüòÇ

You get effort though. places might consider one, think Missouri one needs it. moderate (~45%) vaccination St. Louis St. Charles counties, ~35% St. Louis City. lot MO worse, cases exploding. [Clots common infection  different numbers think deaths skewing towards pepsi consumers though. would think 2023 would global back normal, assuming vaccines rolled faster &amp; then. need remember pre-COVID normal included international travel, bigger hurdle able go back school/work/events domestically. US current pace, I'd expect rest year still transitional, perhaps bit early part next year due winter spring 2022 full normality, provided crazy variant comes along messes vaccine effectiveness, though hopefully boosters comes pass. think Depends contract. 500M doses purchased discounted prices specifically donation. normal prices likely domestic use. That‚Äôs extreme lmao. world come Fine, impact East Coast. 

Why ask initial question? could get pointless squabble Reddit? fuck sake. guessing may 800th time, wearing mask ‚Äúscared.‚Äù courtesy people.

Nearly 70% adults nowhere near enough? us wore masks worst it, continue crowded/indoor areas never confused. would appreciate media making shit up. killed far, far, far fewer citizens US, UK, Europe did. seems like good goal. They‚Äôll real world example reopening schools without masks vaccinations. interesting. I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôll Omega then, lol. care happens them? They‚Äôre young healthiest people entire world. Yup haven‚Äôt seen won‚Äôt vaccinated. toddler cancer it‚Äôs least could do. care don‚Äôt take them? loss. don‚Äôt disagree sentiment vascular/heart issues early overblown thing: Vaccination greatly reduces spread virus reduces individual risk, even fairly low already. getting vaccinated selfish stupid. one confused, either needed insure safety amazes people whose job literally peak health antivax. Yeah I‚Äôm curious going happen outbreak inevitable outbreak comes. mean like make athletes sit? seems like disaster waiting happen  Olympics fucking useless. Change mind. Could 200m earmarked well? USA. got second dose yesterday ontario overheard 2 pharmacists saying supply Moderna set expire next week one wanted Moderna one. think lot problem least many got Pfizer first dose. excess Moderna short supply Pfizer people want mix doses. people referring getting vaccinated Fauci ouchie, thus it‚Äôs code saying ‚Äúdon‚Äôt vaccinate Florida‚Äù easy policy free future space destroying childhood millions children 

Get outta ridiculous hyperbole. parents, grandparents caregivers dying covid wasn‚Äôt destroying kids‚Äô lives already. God forbid distance school wear mask. 

I say teacher absolutely hated teaching online. done, kids bounce back. Hilaria Baldwin's PR nightmare gets bronze. That‚Äôs CDC‚Äôs stance. LA says mask indoors, agree LA *because it‚Äôs local health order* St. Louis brought back mask mandate. wonder trend. This. CDC done nothing give mixed signals moved goalposts since began. absolve antivaxxers blame, small extent can't blame distrusting. Also curious gonna last another six months year it‚Äôs going completely blow up.

I actually think less dramatic that. western countries, may epidemic within next 12 months, much world still unvaccinated, seeing cases slip cracks years come.  virus neither sentient predictable

The virus actually predictable, pretend know means bad news.

All agree with, tell read post *exactly* top rated comments be. probably stop reading them.  agree! need data this, especially considering many kids eligible vaccine yet. 

I would also like know likely transmitted outdoors. told outdoor activities largely safe, still case Delta? haven‚Äôt seen addressed anywhere. anyone knowledge/links, please share. honor system people dishonorable get vaccinated. kind double sounds like live‚ÄîFlorida. someone tell either UK Israel broken **deaths serious cases age groups??**

One claims vaccine looks less effective larger percentage older ppl vaccinated older ppl likely get serious case die.

If that's true, want see data age group!

If provide data, makes suspect they're hiding something. number different possibilities like perhaps vaccine work quite well older ppl bur works terribly younger ppl.

**Show data.** "" like masks, wait try ventilator. "" Immunocompromised people: ""Hey, get third dose gonna go trash? Please?!""

CDC: ""Hmmm...well...technically...hmmm...*wrings hands slightly*...we'd love let but....No.""  Classic American move I'm assuming Belgians adept budgeting average American. Monthly payments would disaster norm. Thanks informative reply! don‚Äôt want wear mask grocery store‚Ä¶stay home. That's funny since far get anti vax'er, yeah, kind does. Shoukd chosen words better one It‚Äôs cause know fault. weren‚Äôt would completely open investigations. cost everyone, including himself, money. Sounds great stupid ass  parts Canada mixing AstraZeneca/Pfizer/Moderna already, would assume probably fine mix JJ too. Lol, I've using lawn guess. probably players get tested routine schedule. tbh bet find vaccinated people source spread. whole ""can't spread it"" thing passes smell test well ""mask might actually increase risk catching covid"" CDC admittedly lied general public. *can't* say vaccinated disease vector lower vaccine uptake increase pressure more/continued shutdowns. think chances spread lower vaccinated? Absolutely. think they're ""near zero"" - fucking way. mean? Yep, imagine living area 20% kids 12-17 vaccinated, Schools requiring masks, limited social distancing 24 kids smallest class size elementary. Recipe disaster. according Israel live Ca parents filed lawsuit mask mandates. Like getting tdap flu shot, unborn son born antibodies. also present breast milk.

[Source 
[Source dentist staff pretty good job PPE protocols (I used work healthcare, notice stuff right away). patients supposed masked except chair, they're not. signs entrance saying masks required, receptionist staff enforce it. One guy carried mask whole time there. believe worst 3 possible scenarios presented study, no? really, keep mutating around world finds way back in.  got J&amp;J April first dose Pfizer scheduled tomorrow morning, second mid-august. 

No one asked I‚Äôd already according Canada Europe, it‚Äôs contraindicated. plenty vaccines available area don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm taking away anyone need. 

I‚Äôm taking prisoners. It‚Äôs boosting profits, though. Unvaccinated people legit cost provide coverage. Ventilators incredibly expensive. opinion, think you‚Äôre freaking little bit. stab, trying realistic you. elderly mother fully-vaccinated, y‚Äôall going fine.

At end day, however, you‚Äôre adult who‚Äôs capable making decisions. need you‚Äôre comfortable with. almost regret getting vaccinated

lmao graph Los Angeles cases already shows bottom plateau sharp ascension we‚Äôve seen twice before. kept going going. Plus, ascension seems even steeper previous two. worrisome. good hope rots next time CNBC article linked opening post mentions 44% hospitalized cases presentation CDC committee. Israeli data published weeks ago (I posted Jerusalem Post article sub too) stated 40% number I've seeing sporadic references throughout media several months significant percentage hospitalized deceased breakthrough cases immunocompromised immunosuppressed persons. sure much helps IFR covid people 80 estimated 10%, meaning 9 10 times, people 80+ get infected covid survive.

Source - anecdotal case too, actually know someone 80s covid 6 months ago, survived without even going hospital. scary far death sentence. explanation doesn‚Äôt really add up. USA behind weeks hit brick wall vaccine hesitancy. 

If assertion true we‚Äôd seeing overwhelming amount breakthrough cases people 60 healthcare workers. We‚Äôre not(thank god). 

Most people I‚Äôve spoken scientific world think Israel‚Äôs number crazy. data outlier every way. mean ‚Äúcompared to‚Äù? doesn‚Äôt matter was. 21,000 preventable American deaths never table certainly considered OK. 

We, one, standing every single American. people forced active service they‚Äôd understand pride country is. AstraZeneca + Moderna Pfizer mix 30% mortality rate? Guy fit lead. soul.  think censorship enrage further. hospital setting. 

Or nursing home! Sure, let's go currently vaccine Candida auris, however, attempts made, experiments involving NDV-3A vaccine successfully immunized mice vaccine also improved protective efficacy antifungal drug micafungin C. auris infection bloodstream.

So happens become issue, doubt, we've got bit leg up. wait till gets bill Apples oranges. like black people. They're one biggest anti vax groups. decisions generally made superintendents others administrative roles, made politicians Governors, School Board members.

It‚Äôs case study it‚Äôs unusual. also P1 variant. real world studies looking thousands people. true. studies sorts problems, like UK one.

But there's also thing Israel saying loss efficiency earliest vaccinated... apply places like UK Canada later 2nd dosing. Could definitely play part. type linear correlation sure makes seem like wearing off. We're also talking transmission, folks ending hospital here. Remember he-whose-name-mustn‚Äôt-be-said polls saying negative things fake illustrate great point. try convince people. They're never going agree voluntarily, instead trying coddle people good sports anyway, really need vaccine mandates... know also don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs going message year. That's exactly it. Zero COVID world happening. think we're ever going point COVID poses zero risk people. People arguing continued restrictions essentially arguing permanent restrictions. Likely Delta completely overtaken Alpha dominant strain. Vaccine holdouts risk got it, infected, natural immunity. Spike India went also. Hopefully trend coming US soon really think vast majority people intentionally try get sick disease unknown long term side effects 2 weeks sick pay. COVID doesn‚Äôt really seem seasonal. guess republican leaders decided needed change tactics. Pushing vaccination blaming unvaccinated.  Seems vaccine would great insurance able compete something trained 18 hours day entire life... That‚Äôs greatest deal relation higher education lol question worst. Fuk!  first shot nothing like this. people get vivid feel like worse? that's tucked up. brother get vaccinated wish did.  taking extra precautions logical science-based long breakthrough cases happen Nobody except Redditors another lockdown whatever reason. know early tell, trend continues, wave Delta peaked fast due quickly spreads. able run like wind doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean playing full deck. There's study Lancelot today (see top science sub /r/covid19) found cognitive issues even w ""mild"" infections. 
 
Tired mild shit. want it. Boosted.  Okay, dilemma. parents want go vacation weeks, we're vaccinated moderna. paper safe, I'm bit concerned.

Here's thing, parents 70s. mom congestive heart failure. risk factors COVID. vaccine breakthrough cases, people still get sick even die vaccine. happens mostly older people, people preexisting conditions (like CHF). So...as tell I'm concerned.

Another factor. live state COVID rates pretty low got act together (northeast). We're going going Tennessee South Carolina. Looking COVID maps forecasts next weeks, looks like situation south rapidly deterioriating time get there, things could really bad, risk factor 10x would stayed home. 

For reference, going fairly long vacation, around 3 weeks, starting early-mid august (week either 8th 15th) returning probably early september. things keep going are, south might rampant COVID. given out, going touristy areas, around people, yeah, idk, even vaccine. Again, vaccine foolproof. Even avoid hospitalization, could still get bad flu like symptoms putting drag whole thing.

That said, decided ask advice here. CDC seems generally say ""if vaccinated, good go"", I'm cautious. We've social distancing year, STILL wear masks DESPITE vaccinated. I'm quite frankly germophobe. thing is, risk factors, fact vaccine infallible, fact I'm going going areas country logarithmically higher risk rate staying home, concern legitimate? overthinking it? (I tend overthink things). parents gung ho going, keep saying ""we already didnt go last year, vaccinated, we're going, idk, think could bad given we're likely going going rates far worse past months.  long term expected, average, always, short term. Unless assume mass death susceptible individuals, case virus. wish people get downvoted asking questions. famous case virus intentionally let loose rabbit population Australia control invasive species. original theory susceptible population would get removed rabbit population time, turned true while, turned mutation rate virus, dramatically faster mutation rate rabbits, (think terms rabbit generations vs virus generations) meant rule hold, rabbits evolved time resistant, matter, virus adapted further.  vaccinated there's reason ""enjoy life."" extremely unlikely serious symptoms, even get COVID, also unlikely. 

All life involves risk. Every time get car assume risk. Every time eat hamburger take risk. Ditto drink alcohol. There's way live life that's risk free. yeah people ridiculous. always approach dishonestly too, like refuse acknowledge us want creepy new virus bodies help it.  live almost one wearing masks regardless vaccinated now

We high vaccinated percentage 70% population 1 dose 50% 2 doses

And currently area 60ish cases day

What worries US boarder opens despite requiring Americans fully vaccinated cross I'm sure surprise see surge next months due delta variant especially add international travel 

I take going US

What's also interesting European countries consider fully vaccinated previous infection plus 1 mRNA dose.

But Canada US still require 2. 

I covid Nov 2020 lingering thing pepsi tastes like chemicals since February might gotten alittle better 1st shot time.

Some things like cooked eggs bacon smell alittle different taste normal,as,far tell. 

Getting 2nd shot today though know feel mixing pfizer Moderna I'm hoping give pfizer again. Wearing mask big deal working home put mask go supermarket. extremely unpleasant wear one day work , particularly working long shift hot building. justified make people wear effective defense vaccines. Yes, confounding variables prevented drawing strong conclusion efficacy, basically, tracks pretty well case. Essentially 100% non-vaccinated workers either infected *or* active antibodies Covid, presumably previous infection. ignoring confounding variable non-vaccinated workers antibodies, breakthrough rate basically sets efficacy vaccine compared novel exposure.

Which brings important point kinds numbers. ‚Äúnatural‚Äù immunity continues grow infection Covid, vaccine efficacy compared general population would *expected* drop portion level natural immunity previous encounter. Keep mind seeing numbers like ‚Äú32% efficacy‚Äù, it‚Äôs still quite worrying, without looking deeper don‚Äôt know control group screened antibodies enrollment. extreme case non-vaccinated people exposed naturally, would *expect* low (if any) ‚Äúefficacy‚Äù vaccine compared non-vaccinated population (with antibodies previous exposure). doesn‚Äôt mean vaccine isn‚Äôt still critically important *haven‚Äôt yet exposed*. 100% everything said. Congratulations marriage! key. 

‚ÄúAt UF Health Jacksonville, Dr. Haley said 90 percent Covid patients unvaccinated 5 percent fully vaccinated. remaining 5 percent vaccinated also significant comorbidities immunosuppressant drugs.‚Äù agree, especially considering great data is. CDC say vaccinated people can't get Covid? boatload documentation needs reviewed. clinical trial data, also information vaccine manufactured. Information manufacturing facility itself, documentation made correctly. reviewed one person, review team, looks different parts submission based expertise. friend really medical field they're capable reading understanding science studies surrounding vaccines safety vaccines. also medical field care harming others selfish actions. Every Western country vaccines. live Sweden genuinely curious ‚Äúworked Sweden‚Äù respect. Perhaps Delta. We'll adapt. booster good cares, it. Something tells less poll corporate cabal. Disgusting Don‚Äôt worry, beds sex free disposable. Never knew people would terrified vaccine protect deadly virus.  thought believe polls anymore? das macht nicht wirklich spa√ü. 3 Weeks now: US Olympian permanent lung damage can't compete ever again. totally agree. case **rate** bit scary vaccinated older people, infection-spreading numbers going mostly found unvaccinated. come USA try get here. vaccines know half country bunch twats.     burden proof them. studies supporting evidence take priority unsubstantiated claims. Misinformation.
And problem? can't worry yourself?  says working. However, get side effects mean working. almost certainly working either way. side effects immunocompromised somehow, may may working, know get antibody test certain amount time confirm. Honestly, could done another week wait least. Three weeks seemed short interval. rough side effects first dose recovered fatigue 3 days second one. went again...

Sucked, least done now. Zika Asking here, unless someone recommendation subreddit ask type thing.

I‚Äôm fully vaccinated (Pfizer). spent time two people 15th-18th became symptomatic tested positive Covid (they vaccinated). spent lots close time partner 18th-20th tested positive 20th (they also full Pfizer vaccination symptoms). 

I don‚Äôt symptoms. 

I know say get tested 5 days exposure - potentially exposed days. Would 5 days first day, 5 days last day? 

I already got negative PCR test 21st testing today, idea dates trust, around people next week work. Agreed. Fed ex Peru country dire need imagining 20 years ""I chance make big compete 2021 Olympics, instead stuck libs, refused vaccine ended getting covid dropping last minute"". Years practice, training commitment drain make pointless political statement. Even idea conspiracy theory year ago. asking them. Initially incorrect circumstances, I'll repeat now: least virus kills idiots sensible people. Thank sharing... I'm confused shared tweet instead actual link.

Also link mention India all. shows global vaccinations explains USA everybody jabbed yet.   Good. Boosters us morons. Closer 34%. That's side event year. Athletic nurses push olympians ventilators around thd track. Almost nothing said makes sense matches happened. Sweden actually vaccines.  going public without smartphone? bet many countries similar numbers. reason waste better dead. Boosters mandated vaccines passes FDA full approval. Mandated businesses colleges military, mean. prefer Chris Trager analogy. ""My body like microchip, flu (COVID) like grain sand. could literally shut whole system."" Way accurate. cure mode also solve incorrigible problem third population even wanting cure?  Sad Send another (any other) country people sense. really. Even Olympians allergies. Also paralympians. main reason athletes given though want miss days training recover vaccine seems pretty stupid end compete covid.  üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ fucked, never going end guess you‚Äôre expert then. I‚Äôll get touch CDC since haven‚Äôt seen anyone die city. state 'national emergency'

Uh... Yep too... I'm waiting see studies long term effects asymptomatic/mild illness vaccination run streets naked mask. 

Lot's reports strokes, lung scarring, vascular issues, long covid mild/asymptomatic illness *before* vaccination. Risks *probably* lower seen evidence yet. would anyone risk essentially something they've working whole lives avoid vaccine?

Because even elite athletes access Facebook valuable ""information"" that's allowed posted it. Um, yes know. drive local children‚Äôs hospital ask many patients currently treating COVID, lol. I‚Äôll give hint, answer 0. Kids 12 FAR less likely die hospitalized COVID vaccinated people 50+. People love tout benefits vaccine (and yes, fantastic), nowhere near effective protection COVID child. send ur kid mask Zoom year again... recovery, yes probably would less susceptible getting breakthrough infection. kind doubt data exists yet, though.  Ah, ok, makes lot sense Eh, I‚Äôm liberal, listen science, understand novel virus information surrounding changes rapidly understanding advances. (And virus mutates.) Therefore, I‚Äôm playing safe. Plus, also like gotten sick year half.

I‚Äôm still living life, gone (uncrowded, outdoor seating) restaurants, hang vaccinated friends family. need go store, mask, I‚Äôm going grocery shopping socialize. I‚Äôm indoors retail job 40 hours week, mask customers disgusting gets crowded. Plus, enjoy extra benefit getting RBF one say boo it. :D America selfish  Honestly, wish they‚Äôd mandate improved ventilation businesses (esp restaurants, wearing mask isn‚Äôt practical). won‚Äôt happen dare cut precious profits‚Ä¶ Japan vaccinated country earth, like 15% thing people keep forgetting: mask guidance ever vaccinated. guidance unvaccinated must continue wearing mask everywhere. clearly didn't. vaccinated took masks off, unvaccinated (well, still wearing one begin with!)

So.. really, needs form vaccine passport prove it. Rumor Sept-Jan approval kids.  yo ill coach. dont know shit blocking im vaxxed af Boggles mind. hard requirement day 1. 

I‚Äôve long fan defender Olympics, they‚Äôve really lost crap. end?

Do think putting mask vaccinated person, without strict distancing efficacy whatsoever? think requiring vaccinated people mask situations going move needle way whatsoever?

The answer questions no. Without adding distancing requirements, masking generally pretty ineffective. bandaid held place better option. FAR better option, turns Covid minor inconvenience vast majority people. 

So unless suggesting locking things down, reinstituting restrictions keep people congregating destroying economy, masks nothing make feel better. 

You want clamor something, clamor vaccine mandates, FDA approve BLA finally. job put mind ease ineffective universal mandates make negligible difference vaccinated people. I‚Äôm American ICU ECMO specialist RN done nothing take care extraordinarily sick COVID patients last year. Seeing article took breath away genuinely made nauseous. realize everyone doesn‚Äôt see horrors illness like do, truly understand people CHOSEN get vaccinated fly internationally. breaks heart.

I live Indiana. I‚Äôm elderly, disability use wheelchair. personal care assistants help daily tasks. went total hell much pandemic; since I‚Äôm high-risk stopped leaving house all, except medical appointments. always active person, traveling around country, going concerts etc. horrible effect mental health. One PCAs worked years traveled saw life changed. saw became different person, frequent panic attacks severely depressed.

Then vaccine came hope again. got vaccinated assistants except one, repeatedly refused. devastating me. thought cared couldn‚Äôt one thing needed keep safe. afraid fire seemed like type try cause problems it. best assistant got along well, everything changed. became toxic lost respect well. Finally, mutually agreed stop working me, didn‚Äôt mention vaccine, truth biggest reason didn‚Äôt want around anymore. simply couldn‚Äôt feel safe around her.

I believe solution make vaccine mandatory nursing home home health workers. don‚Äôt education knowledge willingness get vaccine otherwise. sometimes it‚Äôs people expect. don‚Äôt hire people unless vaccinated, it‚Äôs surprising number unvaxxed apply even though say vaccine required. It‚Äôs limiting life it‚Äôs hard find people vaxxed top requirements.

If vaccinated, GTFO healthcare. People disabilities seniors get vaccinated, need everyone around us also still vulnerable breakthrough infections, especially Delta. I‚Äôm back limiting outings Delta anger firmly directed unvaccinated people. want life back ones healthcare willfully ignorant make angry all. MaHHH FreeDums  inconvienent want pandemic (throws rattle pram).  part anything else matter new information comes out

These reasons I've seen...  think right death rate going again, given likely areas low vaccine uptake (which tend correlate areas weren‚Äôt taking covid seriously anyway) see lockdowns happening. Got actual examples, going stick empty platitudes? really fucking simple, understand people ""confused"" this. FFS. believe currently do, 20% new cases nation-wide happening state. question opposite: team members allowed leave Olympics without vaccinated? Holy shit dude It‚Äôs extremely Black Mirror-like frightening. That's great news. breakthrough infection?  Lol, fools already made choice. unvaccinated weren‚Äôt masking masks mandating, aren‚Äôt masking now. literally doesn‚Äôt matter people. 100%... baseball terms, they're swinging ball way late.... everybody's gone home. pathogen risk groups already protected from, people getting seriously sick point willingly passed protection offered them.

Mom 3. Previously super healthy, prime life. future sadly unclear.

DEATH ENDPOINT!!!  Delta variant coming him. work office workspace everybody vaccinated, sure. vast, vast majority people not, many parts country depending type job, may minority vaccinated.

This full approval needed thing, idea FDA dragging point. studying vaccines form another year half, mrna data least 15 years, wide scale vaccination plenty data draw least 6 months now. 

Full approval would give jobs schools incentive force individuals either vaccinate wear mask day. Seems pretty simple solution me. disingenuous criticize people want stricter measures wanting fabled covid zero, really, want things controlled better. really saying there's room improvement current situation covid zero? critics clamoring ""worldwide lockdown forced vaccination drive"". want form general mask mandate--heck, even mask recommendation--and CDC even give us that. May need add ‚ÄúI‚Äôm healthier 99.9% rest US, covid won‚Äôt kill me‚Äù could go wrong? Per CDC website, flu kills anywhere 37 - 199 kids season. COVID killed 500. COVID dangerous.

Full text: EMA‚Äôs human medicines committee (CHMP) recommended granting extension indication COVID-19 vaccine Spikevax (previously COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna) include use children aged 12 17 years. vaccine already authorised use people aged 18 above.

The use Spikevax vaccine children 12 17 years age people aged 18 above. given two injections muscles upper arm, four weeks apart.

The effects Spikevax investigated study involving 3,732 children aged 12 17 years. ongoing study carried accordance Spikevax‚Äôs paediatric investigation plan (PIP), agreed EMA's Paediatric Committee (PDCO).

The study showed Spikevax produced comparable antibody response 12- 17-year-olds seen young adults aged 18 25 years (as measured level antibodies SARS-CoV-2). addition, none 2,163 children receiving vaccine developed COVID-19 compared four 1,073 children given dummy injection. results allowed CHMP conclude efficacy Spikevax 12- 17-year-olds similar adults.

The common side effects children aged 12 17 similar people aged 18 above. include pain swelling injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle joint pain, enlarged lymph nodes, chills, nausea, vomiting fever. effects usually mild moderate improve within days vaccination.

The CHMP noted due limited number children adolescents included study, trial could detected new uncommon side effects estimated risk known side effects myocarditis (inflammation heart muscle) pericarditis (inflammation membrane around heart).

However, overall safety profile Spikevax determined adults confirmed adolescent study; CHMP therefore considered benefits Spikevax children aged 12 17 outweigh risks, particular conditions increase risk severe COVID-19.

The safety efficacy vaccine children adults continue monitored closely used vaccination campaigns across Member States, EU pharmacovigilance system ongoing additional studies company European authorities.

How Spikevax works
Spikevax works preparing body defend COVID-19. contains molecule called messenger RNA (mRNA) instructions making spike protein. protein surface SARS-CoV-2 virus virus needs enter body‚Äôs cells.

When person given vaccine, cells read mRNA instructions temporarily produce spike protein. person‚Äôs immune system recognise protein foreign produce antibodies activate cells (white blood cells) attack it.

If, later on, person comes contact SARS-CoV-2 virus, immune system recognise ready defend body it.

The mRNA vaccine stay body broken shortly vaccination.

Are ok endemic virus that‚Äôs (generally) made mild via vaccine (at least line virus)?

Is main KPI based cases, hospitalizations, deaths?

How first start objective craft public health recommendations accordingly  [By taking vaccines IOC offered understand athlete, point, would risk training, CUSP biggest event world's stage, getting vaccinated.  personal risk able compete, least, taking something people thought about...right? 

(Yeah know there's also public health implications, personal health implications getting really sick, discussed threads, lets talk act able compete...it's mind-boggling take predictable path, get vaccinated deal side-effects schedule) pointless 6+ months. Many physician friends getting boosters.  great point agree you.

That CDC must take lead, acknowledge challenges, make strong policies/guidelines government make accommodations. We're getting point ~6 months vaccination people. long protection last? true. vaccine hesitancy German speaking world seems underestimated. Austria Switzerland western countries worst uptake France. Olympic officials make mandatory?

I'd assume unilaterally. They'd probably need Tokyo/Japan get board well that's something government would do. Yes! many people still looking individual thing society. Masking hard would cut spread get people vaccinated. anxiously awaiting lower age group shot emergency approval. I‚Äôve got got Pfizer March. Relatively mild symptoms, I‚Äôm definitely feeling sick enough lay work. 

I‚Äôm sure gave me, far social/family interactions everyone know vaccinated. vaccinated friend saw weekend symptoms tested positive me. maybe him? suppose could‚Äôve exposed public- go sporting event. difficult tell. 

If you‚Äôre worried would limit interactions keep wearing mask. get it, you‚Äôll fine. government problem year gassing shit BLM protesters. I‚Äôm sure could rednecks. Half probably infected would pretty turned away gas. Nah, jail duration pandemic. 85% 60s that‚Äôs far enough. ALWAYS abuse rules. give inch, take mile. built-in business model. know house insurance. excuse deny coverage, use it. know America sorta used health care controlled insurance companies, normal. Health care right, citizen, universally covered, matter much asshole are, matter take care not. know, still relatively hard get jab August regions Germany Italy. even know people Italy wait September. data far correlating vaccination rate infection rate. 
Of NE states 60% one shot vaccination rate, one (Vermont) 1.2. 
Vermont 1.18, double even weeks ago. 
That said, high vaccination rate states see less hospitalizations deaths, perhaps alignment end day saying. [The IOC basically offered every athlete chance get  really saying support booster shots, need get vulnerable peeps yesterday It‚Äôs almost like headlines around COVID days designed create clicks, inform (for 6 months more) Daily Thread predominantly anti-mask, anti-lockdown. threads opposite.

Meanwhile, best countries EE &lt;50% total population &lt;70% over60s one dose. Oh don‚Äôt worry that, many labs still rigorously working better vaccines. even working cell-based vaccines opposed antibody ones hopes provide higher immunity variants concern. [we already Unless vacuuming COVID ICU ward, zero. use ""Native"", two syllables. vaccines protecting virtually everyone getting seriously ill why, says NYT, CDC \*not\* considering rescinding policy -- vaccinated people need wear masks -- absent serious change science. hand, study found immunity 4 cold-causing coronaviruses generally lasts less one oft-cited study, example, people given dose cold-causing coronavirus, got sick recovered, given another dose year later. patients got reinfected, showing quickly immunity waned.

The go back mandates capacity restrictions might actually riots. desk things go back normal get vaccine. 160 million done suffer 160 million dumb. Pfizer said no?  Google UK covid cases look uptick cases, filter deaths look deaths. Deaths hospitalizations, vaccines, nearly strong correlation cases used be. get it, we're used seeing cases go up, deaths go rate, vaccines treatments getting stronger skyrocketing cases automatically mean skyrocketing hospitalizations/death. mean, I'd reply reply would basically copy paste previous post since addresses said. guess we're done here. knowledge, never consented allowing kid's doctor(s) speak diagnosis, after.

 Stop sticking head sand. millions people won‚Äôt get vaccine matter what. going back full pandemic mode come fall hospitals full refrigerated trucks outside hospitals immunity wears catching last year bodies worn down.  Hells yeah unfortunately means is, even quickly surpassed herd immunity threshold types vaccinations, virus continue spread mutate absence indoor mask usage NPIs. mutations eventually evade vaccine immunity, rendering vaccines less less effective.

This speculation based current vaccine escape theory/evolution models. Efficacy may significantly lower asymptomatic mild infection.

We need adjust thinking properly account it.  Definitely still get vaccine, two cents.

US country antivaxxers.  part society required make sacrifices behalf refuse partake society  understand fuzz without clear agreement we're even talking about.

Do use same, objective definition ""symptomatic COVID""? not, highly doubt it, would first go-to explain difference.

Also honestly, nobody cares ""symptomatic COVID"". Spread something matters; hospitalizations deaths matter; long-term effects matter; ""symptomatic"" case cough fever 2 days not.  Eastern Europe. Uptake terrible Germany Austria aswell. Except not. Yes, people never acknowledge uncertainty. claim ""scientific truth"" way fast. 

I used guilty following sub blindly, got burnt ""facts"" everyone unanimously seemed agree actually proven wrong. However, no-one ever accountable this. read sub today sounds like they've always right everything.

I trust established narrative anymore. tell come back explain need get vaccinated need come work all.  haven't. one ever said provided sterilizing immunity.

If everyone who's vaccinated gets infected cold flu like symptoms days stays hospital morgue, vaccine job. Throw away masks, let's go back normal. either get infected feel like shit days, get vaccinated roll dice.

Once children 12 able vaccinated, absolutely excuse continue restrictions. democrats told world ending mask up?

So what? They're still comparing vaxxed unvaxxed proper methodolgy (which includes filtering previously infected people). And, guess what, data consistent data released Delta (Alberta, UK, almost certainly including youth 39% efficacy means even lower 39%.

Oh alright, vaccine completely ineffective age groups close 100% effective youth. they're enforcing green pass policy vaccine according data would actually *more likely* cause infection. definition inconsistent. already reliable information regarding J&amp;J‚Äòs effectiveness Delta variant?

Deaths lower, different vaccines. may know time exactly death rate changed. one thing certain statistically nobody dying anymore, serious outbreaks completely avoidable. damn anti vaxxer need hear message loud clear, grim better.

Second paragraph explains might hurt efficacy. need define ""a lot"" comment meaning. hurt include define ""effective"". risk infection drastically reduced vaccination, risk death/serious illness drastically reduced manage get infected. numbers now, safe assume every 100 covid cases unvaccinated, 20-40 vaccinated people. every 100 deaths unvaccinated people, 1 vaccinated death.

Tune later find out.....I going wager either latter deny end. Portugal going absolutely shatter 70% thresold total population vaccinated. Basically, people younger 23 can't even make appointment vast majority people younger 30 got first shot. So, currently 64% people least 1 dose probable reach least 80% population vaccinated (and I'm even considering people younger 18). wish harm anyone, honestly believe needs happen order people get damn vaccine already quit political BS game. new variant needs start taking unvaccinated people masses like movie Outbreak order get people take thing seriously. I'm sick tired put crap amount people (I'm Florida) around give damn thing truly believe nothing.  See above, apparently around one half times many administered moderna. Well, alarming sense people vaccinated require hospitalization die, somewhat alarming sense vaccines appear insufficient sterilizing immunity achieve herd immunity. Meaning disease continue spread amongst vaccinated unvaccinated alike.   I've able find online, no. released data raw findings back claim. pandemic end? kind sounds like won‚Äôt. take, basically. fully vaccinated, wearing mask feels like social convention me. legitimate worry Vid since chances getting spreading astronomically small.

Impeccable logic. Yeah, I'd first line. I'm already wearing short sleeves visit elderly relatives? Even they‚Äôre vaccinated pass them, children 12 can‚Äôt vaccinated yet. Also relatives friends cancer survivors immunocompromised? Yup pass also. Fauci said x must true?? know people got 1 shot each, fine. saw ‚Äúsome‚Äù tests show efficacy high. Like anything else, PLEASE ask doctor first.  Vanity Fair article nice summary Assuming statement true thing they'd risking everyone around them. kinda answered yourself. non-sense? risk important make known, mean spam create alarmism whoever takes vaccine know even small risk imho. I'd go get booster today allowed. Side effects damned, want covid. Bingo. viral infection presents risks, even ones common like strep throat. Okay, good know, sure :) dumb.  risk kids definitely statistically insignificant delta surges. We‚Äôre seeing reports young kids contracting COVID lately hospitalized. What‚Äôs more, they‚Äôve found blood vessel damage even mild cases children. Add fact already know causes brain damage. It‚Äôs death toll. prospect kids chronic health problems 10 years now? Worked Sweden though. Maybe dunno someone else does... know working (testing?) booster shot, assume booster contents initial 1st/2nd vaccines. Assume, know fact.

So question is, see downsides giving third dose initial vaccine prove higher efficacy adverse affects? hate headlines ask question.  ufos bring coronavirus outer space?  See it. idea lucky got vaccine? :). Glad did! UK definitely bad covid rates right now, compare specific age range UK population whole Germany? COVID specifically  seeing rise breakthrough cases I'd agree you, are. boosters would safely lower risk breakthrough cases, shots would coming supply going expire anyway, personally think ok least let older people/those risk get one. Fauci, well adviser President Biden, director US National Institute Allergy Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part US government's National Institutes Health body give money organisation collaborated Wuhan Institute organisation - US-based EcoHealth Alliance - awarded grant 2014 look possible coronaviruses received $3.7m NIH, $600,000 given Wuhan Institute Virology.

It mind-boggling took year information disseminated main stream media.  Yes discussing questioning outlier data equates discussion bat shit conspiracy theories taking vaccine leading prolonging pandemic. think clear actions CDC decided going endemic virus that‚Äôs (generally) made mild via vaccine (at least line virus)?

and main KPI based hospitalizations, deaths

It also clear many/most criticism CDC coming experts think different endpoint. would get second dose recommended interval worry boosters later.

There's discussion (with links) mega-thread, stickied thread. weird felt nothing either Pfizer shot. arm sore hour two also. Kinda weird (but obvious) everyone reacts differently.  school districts, too. They‚Äôd fucking better \*sighs vaccinated Missourian\*

I'm preparing last sentence now. point potential pitfall authors try address exercept NEJM paper. right, perfect test would prospective placebo v. Vaccine trial (which can‚Äôt happen course): 

‚ÄúFirst, used test-negative case‚Äìcontrol design estimate vaccine effectiveness symptomatic disease caused delta variant, compared alpha variant, period delta variant circulating. approach described detail elsewhere.10 brief, compared vaccination status persons symptomatic Covid-19 vaccination status persons reported symptoms negative test. approach helps control biases related health-seeking behavior, access testing, case ascertainment.‚Äù

‚ÄîAlso NEJM authors go highlight comparing efficacy alpha delta‚Äù: 
From NEJM: ‚ÄúFor secondary analysis, proportion persons cases caused delta variant relative main circulating virus (the alpha variant) estimated according vaccination status. underlying assumption vaccine efficacy equally effective variant, similar proportion cases either variant would expected unvaccinated persons vaccinated persons. Conversely, vaccine less effective delta variant alpha variant, delta variant would expected make higher proportion cases occurring 3 weeks vaccination among unvaccinated persons. ‚Äú offence, think really long hard think mindset. English person, amount right v left hatred Americans really sad see. 

I hope find peace start respect future I've got idea. We've got Comirnaty Pfizer/BioNTech, Vaxzevria AstraZeneca, Spikevax Moderna EU. names used apps using EU COVID-19 certificate. Removing early first place big mistake.  lazy ass got first last week, least little helpful wait second? wish could get second right CDC come recommend vaccine passports. would probably better mask mandate  You‚Äôre right didn‚Äôt make comment. Yet everyone else understood joke. decided try sound smart ‚ÄúwELL aCkShuaLLy‚Ä¶‚Äù response wound sounding like moron.  Well could say rosy less correct. Let's see like that.

Conservatives changed social behavior since pandemic began, wear masks, getting vaccinated wish coronavirus kill 600k people, they're okay it. Pretty sure we‚Äôre agreement. subreddit place. see one giving us hope, scroll little article saying Pfizer vaccine failed.

**WHICH IT** needed morning. real case ""i'm fully vaccinated worthless"" syndrome. thank post. lot sympathy people, though know popular thing say around parts. They've effectively traumatized media, messaging, fear-based headlines. hard think anything going improve 18 months that. think people settle eventually, greater messaging shifts cooler heads prevail, it'll long road many them.  sub:

""The CDC says need wear masks, let's it!""

Also sub:

""The CDC says vaccinated people need masks. They're totally incompetent!"" worst case sensible scenario plan for. care hospitals get everything need, nobody right thing dies stupid stubborn people. 

I care think grim overblown might hurt economy politics bullshit. I'm completely sick it. impression UK went gung-ho Astra Zeneca.

have given AZ flick nowadays? percent AZ:Pfizer ? Looks like people recovering rate. Good news suppose.   ""Easier."" Exactly. based science, based laziness. 

And yes, still small chance still pass vaccinated, why, say again, **unvaccinated people still wear masks.** CDC said safe enough. 

We always going unvaccinated. always going coronavirus. neither medically necessary ethical force vaccinated people wear masks forever.  say most? Yep! Symptoms still mild luckily. I've head colds far worse before. severe asthma imagine vaccine. Still taking preventative measures ensure chest stays clear though safe. Yeah I‚Äôm surprised isn‚Äôt talked more. Long COVID absolutely *wreck* athletes performance. Good luck competing you‚Äôre fucking breath walking stairs.   Well we‚Äôre discussing isn‚Äôt death sentence, typically standard higher roughly 1-2 percent mortality rate. one forgets this. constantly mentioned. know we've quarantining home since got back trip careful way back avoid people wear masks...  think you‚Äôre seeing that, it‚Äôs either unvaccinated people attempting follow rules, vaccinated people can‚Äôt make minds haha. Like said, it‚Äôs basically nothing, pick poison.. Yeah read want potentially feel shit competing.

Fair enough really, preparing years wake headache nausea sore arm would really mess things up. considering people die COVID past reproductive age, no, it‚Äôs Darwinism work. somewhat agree this. Experts said vaccine seems reduce likelihood long covid, haven‚Äôt seen actual data (I don‚Äôt think any).

That said, short vaccine passports/various forms mandates (which support!), I‚Äôm sure done. right, death sentence most. lead changes lungs chronic effects. athletes want healthy lungs. That's exactly CDC trying recommending mask mandates vaxxed people. 

It safe vaxxed people go business, mask mask. suggestion otherwise seeds doubt *very effective* vaccines creates even reluctance get shot. 

No vaccine history ever 100% protective. That's never point vaccines anyway. suggesting fully vaxxed people serious danger incorrect antivaxx It‚Äôs pretty common here.  think funny point don‚Äôt wear one lol   pretty solid bet hospitalizations deaths going dramatically reduced compared January 2021. Even states low vaccination rates, vulnerable populations vaccinated rates 80%. restrictions dropped. Oh word? know that. make requirement compete sure then. Yup. Pretty clear point time. believe we're kept dark bit here. We're going need boosters. There's reason US government quietly picked another 200 million doses day Sounds like bs, got Pfizer 4 friends mine got Pfizer. got Corona bout 2 weeks ago. know people Pfizer also got sick. That‚Äôs quite bit different situations, folks constantly together confined warship 24/7. I‚Äôd expect Covid spread among fully vaxxed households still, doubt worry much contact public. possibly go wrong? üòÇ didn‚Äôt actually. original Wuhan mutated known UK variant Alpha variant within months. hit US early 2020 originated here. no, always around didn‚Äôt hear different variants cuz much goi g keeping people safe. Yes Mr. Wayne come black country live in? vast majority cases don‚Äôt result hospitalization though mean, catch COVID mid-Olympics going huge disadvantage. know know that.  unfortunate chose misleading number. 

The data still really really positive vaccines, need give people reason question it. used numbers starting May even June everyone wanted would fully vaccinated. would super long hose!

Does work water swimmers?  sure sports, swimmer training excuse definitely cover other. Every single successful athlete know (NCAA Division 1, national international success) swam less pleasant symptoms anything feel vaccine amount rest built training. could see availability issue became eligible weeks Olympic qualifying meeting (in case, US Olympic trials) wanting switch anything interim. meet mentioned enough time get vaccinated Olympics, window extremely narrow super feasible. 

Not credible, [some also cite antibodies   forgetting everyone works concert production. What‚Äôs embarrassing OPs comment? lying about, bud? Thank  Honestly, really see practical difference. Either way, putting selfishness greater good. Ok fda cdc pushed back need booster. trust pharmaceutical company profit motive. Yea based side effects second shot dont want something worse mild form COVID would be. hate wearing mask especially summer starting look like wise choice. Yeah wonder that‚Äôs case virus ‚Äònaturally‚Äô run people infect Oh man, haven‚Äôt seen yet. It‚Äôs either mask mask here, latter much common unless business specifically requests masks. No, people were/are branded conspiracy theorists making unscientific accusations regarding epidemiological research origins covid 19. Aka ""lab leak"" theorists. never secret research international effort. vaccination rate twice city, four times counties state. could get local 83% would dancing rooftop. also leave fact Coronavirus research particularly bat-born mammal coronaviruses ongoing China rest world ever since response 2003 SARS-1 outbreak.

Chances FrankenVirus Chinese Lab, another animal born coronavirus evolved similar way SARS-1 did, far less deadly far contagious. people sub want masks lockdowns forever. Get shot live life, COVID never going away. took couple months ago, interfered shit. Taking 48 hours end world athletes unless lined qualification event.  took goalposts RAN, son. virus roughly 1% death rate Darwinism? Honestly, see unvaccinated wearing masks even required. already weren't. Lol sorry mistake, l thinking brothers' uncles ' mothers' step sisters half sisters' dog. one sounds perfectly reasonable. Highly likely. question becomes would rather catch without vaccine help fight off? I've tested twice cold returned negative.

From I've told others know cold. Slightly worse, bit like flu. Oh, agree, think there‚Äôs another subset that‚Äôs genuinely paralyzed fear. can't hold standard countries unless offer provide vaccine. Pretty sure many countries higher number unvaccinated athletes.   Maybe, Europe countries people use name European developer; Biontech iso Pfizer, Janssen iso J&amp;J. Source delta‚Äôs death rate children? Chances higher virus gets potent. Delta generates 1000x virus upon infection first strain hit US question remains,are effective together...still waiting studies.  Yup that‚Äôs *strongly* disagree goals don‚Äôt give fuck long covid. I‚Äôd rather dead live like rest life. least UK seems care little bit I‚Äôm holding data them.  Novavax covid vaccine nanoparticle vaccine wondering. approved EUA later year. Everyone know thatd gotten covid getting vaccine pfizer. pfizer too. I'm wearing mask end time according doctor, Moderna Pfizer performing slightly better AZ.

Get vaccinated people. Source? would whatever fuck told do. get first shot tell come back 3 4 weeks, that. booster released tell take 9 months second shot, that. like hitting easy button, need really overthink one. organisation - US-based EcoHealth Alliance - awarded grant 2014 look possible coronaviruses bats.

To shows poorly media research contribute spread conspiracy theories.

That program look bat-born Coronaviruses ongoing since Covid-19's cousin, 2003 SARS-1 broke China, Taiwan, sporadically around world contained within year. finally discovered host intermediary animal species' led outbreak fourteen years later 2017. 

SARS-1 warning nature gave world potential kind pandemic. far deadlier coronavirus, master human human transmission well Covid-19 did, warranted kind research EcoHealth virology watchdogs around world conducting watch new potential Coronaviral threats particularly bats mammals part Asia. contagious, im beginning think years vaccinated still catch covid seriously insinuate vaccinated blame? real?

Answer: risking lives every selfish moron refused opt sensible method reducing risk infection.

Eligible people refused get jabbed made bet. We‚Äôll see cards fall. Two subs one. literally could face long haul symptoms (which rare affect young people well).

So rather ruin entire career get long haul symptoms, take vaccine???????? Ok? ‚ÄúCovid easier eradicate‚Äù. Meanwhile, humanity ever eradicated one disease humans. Smallpox. teeny tiny bit worse covid. Also took like 50 years do. yeah eradication totally plausible.   current pace (200-250k daily first doses), month Germany close 70% one dose Canada UK now. could also upsurge end summer schools reopening.

Best idea however would introduce covid pass system like Italy France. April 2020: forged passports available ebay friend friend. Someone know personally forged vax card. moronic is, are. Awesome see decision representatives No, got that, Olympians perhaps anybody else going feel unmatched experts bodies. mean they'll experts biochemistry immunology, could contribute vaccine hesitancy. Apparently virologists always believed optimal timing shots 2 dose vaccine 12 weeks.  big issue tests really know mean clinically. cells react virus mean clinically immune; response weak ineffective.

OTOH know high antibody titer likely protected. better market immunity many ways. Research also able prepare next pandemic. anything, last couple years proven Western countries unable contain virus.

I'll still absolutely trade rest package though. Want trade citizenship mine? Lol Seriously, get good N95 like 3M Aura‚Ñ¢ comfortable make sure fits well (try different size doesn‚Äôt). Surgical cloth masks virtually useless inbound particles. Sorry Captalist 600,000 deaths far greater Economy people work minimum wage rich make money. work one vaccine approved others yet? Like school mandates FDA approved Pfizer vaccine got J&amp;J?  dont disagree you. I‚Äôd rather tax money go towards actually need via medicare medicaid potentially universal health coverage. Currently, spend military medicaid medicare combined. hate pay antivaxxer covid treatment. It‚Äôs different republicans complaining welfare queens eyes. important short term, masking doesn‚Äôt feel like sort offramp. Relying masking indefinitely keep us treading water. Vaccination move needle.

My comment lockdown rhetorical theoretical nature, like supposing alternate universe. simply want get point talk think COVID much something like measles, blue moon.

Presumably faster I'm actually sure that. Mask deeez nutzzz hospitals still much extra capacity?

All hospitals area ringing alarm bells entirety winter spike.  Yes. It‚Äôs pretty much valid model many public health initiatives Mandates like laws good enforced 

I see someone checks vaccinations mean I, Florida elementary school teacher, can‚Äôt wear mask, chose?? I‚Äôd like see rest wackos stop me. Snort. Good one. Confirmation. expect anti-vax Cov-idiot movement would learned, well spoken frontman. scale enough shots, better flu shots. flu shots still incubated eggs part process, takes long time makes guess several months ahead time virulent strains flu season, sometimes successfully, sometimes less. Pfizer/moderna process use egg incubation lead much faster vaccine development timelines.

In addition, coronavirus type mutates slowly flu time develop distribute good match current strain. Love this, hope big success. would also huge benefit like needles. Biden literally said week thinks end August / Sept gets approved children. sorry going try save drowning man, careful doesn‚Äôt pull water Antivaxxers: ""Willie hears ya. Willie care."" Thank you. read watch videos replied it‚Äôs correct. data message media putting regarding J&amp;J efficacy changes everyday. Selectively choosing news reports videos support post dangerous anyone received J&amp;J vaccine. scale level risks take based messaging messaging incorrect, could potentially put risk would otherwise taken. comment still holds, experts agree. Immuno-compromised people discussed terms booster didn‚Äôt respond well either. Unless variants change lot, large differences cell epitopes appear, won‚Äôt need. Unless, simply avoid mild disease. potentially personal preference. 

I agree, anything possible could require different vaccine future better protect Covid. dense intentionally obtuse.

If talked hospitalization rate, maybe would click more. Roughly 20% people average catch covid need hospitalization, high 40% common pre-existing conditions(and low 9% people lowest risk). Many people long road back recovery know people can't put together everyone getting sick causes hospital systems collapse, causes death rate rise significantly. think death rate stays 1% one get adequate medical care?

Nobody, ever, said goal, even possible.

If you‚Äôre fully vaccinated, significantly less risk catch spread virus (39% reduction highly significant) highly significantly less likely symptomatic (which MAY/SHOULD reduce likelihood spreading virus)

On top this, specific odds becoming ill common cold symptoms, low it‚Äôs one greatest scientific achievements, well beyond wildest hopes dreams year ago

Alternate headline. Antibodies exactly antibodies supposed do. know issue intelligence.

Besides, memes powerful genes. Interesting know, area all. way explained me, people get it, higher chance coming contact something helps mutate. 

Edited typo that's actually true. Pfizer point best wildly available vax right now. Covaxin good delta ""This low season. spreading fast summer,"" says Ali Mokdad, tracks coronavirus trends Institute Health Metrics Evaluation (IHME) University Washington. Respiratory diseases flu COVID-19 usually spike winter, people spend much time sequestered indoors.

The problem theory, warmer/hotter parts USA, people sequestering indoors **in summer**. rolling back mandate masks, based month, must take account human behavior given region. cannot one plan correct entire country across entire year. Even got covid vaccinated person, would still leave Olympics anyway. really makes almost difference. Vaccinated people still spreading new variants. likely find place among circulating respiratory diseases point far less serious deadly one immune naive anymore.

It could also Influenza pick genes mammal borne coronaviruses become deadly contagious later years population exposure original Covid vaccines. 

The risk going high Influenza, since mutate often, takes one person infected Covid derivative meet mammal infected similar enough coronavirus get ball rolling like pandemic SARS outbreak 2003. serological study reveals different things challenge study. One intrinsically better other. Challenge studies provide real world data can't really drill mechanisms behind like serological study.

Besides which, see two studies contradict other. volunteers infected slight degree aware infected without blood samples nasal washing.

It's certainly unclear infected volunteers infectious meaningful sense - probably want wash nostrils nasal flushings, typical spreading situations, know. unreasonable assumption likelihood infecting others dramatically lower symptomatic people.

More broadly, easy treat immunity binary concept - biochemical level true. bodies constantly exposed microorganisms, successful invade body wiped immune system without obvious signs. normal, see presume nothing happened. mortality rate US get infected across demographics unvaccinated: use math: .05 (which 1/20) * .18 (1.8%) = .009%

So, using citation, 99.991% chance dying vaccinated US live.

FWIW - sympathize you...just make sure get 2nd dose.

Keep mind, poke arm nothing. get bi-monthly injections eye...be happy experience regular basis. Yeah long term covid issues, that's least scary, shitty thing happen. assume food taste right anymore?  Thank you!! Cynically, think COVID drove media consumption. benefit pretend vaccinated unvaccinated cases same. creates fear drives compulsive clicks/views.

The real story, vaccinate exercise reasonable caution, inspire paranoia. 
Agree. got second jab end April, I'm pretty sure I'd way today even new information, erring side getting protection soon possible. mention live rural south obviously Delta looking aggressive me. eight week interval means ten weeks fully vaccinated (I assume?). That's long time right now. anyone medicine biology background actually know would happen got vaccines?  (I‚Äôm actually going it)

Like them. J&amp;J, Moderna, Pfizer, Astra Zeneca, Sputnik, Sinovac, CanSino, Sinopharm. That's good enough me! open errrr likely better. educated guess though. dipshits say children risk? Also half county vaccinated, good numbers truly shocked well done lockdowns. America people lost shit couldn‚Äôt get greasy hair cut couple months look Texas, Abbot prohibited local government school require masks. kid even old enough elementary school I‚Äôm thinking pulling daycare. It‚Äôs going get ugly people don‚Äôt start getting vaccinated approve younger kids soon. one study (Canada UK) say you‚Äôre incorrect regarding claimed 50-60% efficacy statement. Exactly. Blows mind.

I see news articles, dude gets covid, hospitalized, says he'd rather hospitalized get vaccine.

Like wut?? True. Fortunately events rare, scary first one like that, second one think nurse hurry (can't blame that) bit rougher. Still bad though, needle's real tiny. Good. Fuck Putin.  see two possibilities

1. Israeli data set bad

2. Israelis testing far asymptomatic people, believe case, driving numbers Brits missing. straw man *soo* exhausting. Surely folks creativity imagine situations somewhere current toothless CDC policy FOREVER MASKS. going sound totally weird. favorite singer (John Prine) died Covid April 2020. small social media campaign #jabforjohn started twitter facebook. wore John Prine shirt, put favorite album drive --- mine 45 minutes away! -- let life happen

&amp;#x200B;

More importantly, thought parents failing health I'd hate give them. able hunker since they're retired.  Fair point don‚Äôt think ever going see full vaccination rates permanent lockdowns aren‚Äôt answer. Hopefully new vaccine technology easily adaptable variants. Trust friend, understand frustration find difficulty feeling anything people, especially since consider information outside tight media Q-conspiracy bubble pointed out. 

And get wrong, much wish death people, that's naive know thousands wind dying reason stuck sunk cost fallacy. That's part blows mind. I'd add ""odds transmitting someone else"" matters vaccinated parents unvaccinated children. TLDR: Entire vaccinated family (except me) sick week exposed family member Covid.

Everyone family except youngest fully vaccinated April. Pfizer wife Moderna daughter. 

We decided go extremely overdue family visit ended getting exposed unvaccinated family member. got Sunday family member started showing symptoms Tuesday positive Covid test Thursday. Saturday everyone house symptomatic except me.

My youngest sick fever, cough headache 2 days seemed fine. He's one that's tested since tested positive. daughter coughing lethargic week never ran fever. wife miserable week half migraines, hacking cough, chills exhaustion fever. symptoms minor sniffles could've allergies. 

We assumed first must've gotten summer cold kind since thought vaccine would protect us. Based I've read recently I'm pretty sure feeling symptoms Covid - milder symptoms would've without vaccine. 

My concern many people probably assume can't get Covid vaccinated end getting decide cold spread everywhere.  going especially rough unvaccinated. bring up. people aren‚Äôt reading literature assume symptom == risk. perhaps people dedicated lives education children see bigger picture *just* virus. Remote learning material, deleterious effect learning social emotional health. relaxed quarantine rules age group least likely impacted COVID definitely impacted interrupted school year makes lot sense. Especially conjunction masks. Masks meant prevent transmission infection I've almost definitely COVID twice. job filthy girlfriend bank teller. serious illness January 2020, diagnosed unrecognized virus. shortness breath seriously thought smoking weed lack exercise...but wasn't. COVID test even public recognition then. got December, nearly symptoms. I've never illness like life fever difficulty breathing standard two.

Only recently many things started come back. short term memory FUCKED last year. heart would skip beats chest would seize up. even recognize fucked started come it. Moderna good? one get county Respectfully, get numbers entertainment industry huge portion workforce? 

In 2011, per Los Angeles County Economic Development Corporation's (LACEDC) report: ""The Entertainment Industry the
Los Angeles County Economy"":

162,000 people wage salary 
85,000 free-lance
So 247k combined. 

In 2011 also per LACEDC, roughly 3,950,000 nonfarm jobs LA County. 

So 6% jobs. heard happened India? get buried red caskets white text?  Totally agree think article said respiratory disease It‚Äôs risk free, reduce risk severe complications dramatically. point it‚Äôs individual make mm assessment probably never one. reliable cure flu? common cold (other corona viruses)? Nope, difficult probably never possible mutate quickly. goes new addition common cold viruses (Covid-19). become less virulent likely stay. vaccines till becomes harmless rest best option, far. Nope. Look up. Pfizer. May both, I‚Äôm certain Pfizer. Testing positive covid getting sniffles seems common thing, vaccines definitley job Well people became accustomed old system.  

And changed. people still thinking ""old mindset"".

If hear ""10 cases vaccinated people"" might lots positive tests light didnt qualify ""cases"". 

But unvaccinated group infections would count cases.

At point kind silly compare ""cases"" vaccinated vs unvaccinated populations word longer means thing 2 groups.

I'm sure news hasnt tried make clear people?

It seems really open door misinterpreting data. really numbers game, though.

The people contract delta, greater odds breakthrough cases sheer exposure.

But what's even dangerous people contract delta, greater possibility delta mutating something else.  Mid-thirties. Dr. Vin Gupta encouraging get booster, Obviously downvotes, people don‚Äôt even know asymptomatic Covid isn‚Äôt risk free. vaccine isn‚Äôt going magically protect bad things happen. might help this, might people wind stroke unit large vessel ischemic events (blood supply major sections brain) sniffles even know Covid all. 

I guess point is: don‚Äôt think vaccine removes risk maybe try avoid catching Covid. Huh? cure much better financially vaccine. vaccine makes immune need anything else. cure need every time catch virus. reliable cure, everyone would jump it. people want this? vote. want get contaminated non-vaccinated organs. Think friends found Measels spread respiratory particles.  Oh. got J&amp;J one 2-3 months ago. Thank God got vaccine available shit. think Covid easy mode regards contagious was.

Yay science! Saved lot lives. J&amp;J I'm assuming shit Delta?

I say ***terrible***....but strong mRNA vaccines. Studies shown AstraZeneca 67% effective Delta (and J&amp;J similar AZ)...whereas Pfizer Moderna ~20% higher two people got J&amp;J go get Pfizer Moderna?

I think healthcare provider they're give you. lose sympathy state information CDC, immunologists, scientific journals etc, met YouTube vlogs podcasts saying conspiracy.

Fine listen experts, get vaxxed, could give shit croak.

I mean human condition level, empathize.

But sympathy, none, none them. Per Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) used collect reports adverse events vaccination general public. primarily used identify potential topics investigate regards vaccine reactions. However, event data VAERS often verified often self-reported, assumed adverse events VAERS actually associated cause vaccines, possible estimate frequency adverse events data.

For unvaccinated, bets off... team trump pushing.

Yet Trump took neither hydroxychloroquine ivermectin got sick. Ah. Thanks.  virus evolve flu terms longer pandemic? exhausting.

Or new normal, instead flu killing 30-60k people year, going replaced COVID killing 80-100k people year US every year?  happens teams outbreaks? double count out? take loss? football unless vaccinated. I'll take straight CEO Pfizer! I'm sure they'll welcome new ideas. Mmm... weather pretty nice live near beach SoCal. stuff true see positive negative. calculate efficacy don‚Äôt know number fully vaccinated people exposed Covid didn‚Äôt get infection?

I grateful fully vaccinated can‚Äôt even imagine horrible full blown would feel like.

Stay safe everyone!! Moderna might actually immunoprotective taking doctor never care happens them. They're selfish idiots. here. üò≠  case, means exposed full vaccination (exposure meaning close symptomatic infected person air exhaled 10+ consecutive minutes, would normally pretty much guarantee infection), 88% sure experience symptoms infection. might still caught it, asymptomatic infections significantly harder (though impossible) transmit, obviously pose little health risk personally.

Even see symptoms, likely significantly mild otherwise. instance, job contact tracer breakthrough case woman lupus. Despite baseline immunocompromised, case lethal plague felt like mild cold them.

Whenever see headlines like this, read article see qualifying percent efficacy. many valid metrics, measure different things. like parent comment said, wait J&amp;J results still testing vaccines can't really pinpoint could've gotten it, work-related. weekend symptoms started, hanging around strip strip going MGM, Caesar's Palace, restaurants, pool, etc. also entirely possible virus mutates lethal gives best chance spread

That's difficult due inherent problem killing host. delta variant super spreader mutates host lethal, odds host die spread mutated delta variant someone else. 

Thankfully us inherently unlikely. Would suck though. 

I agree though existence delta variant shit altogether though. people need get vaccinated reduce number breeding grounds viruses. see. Hope feeling 100% soon, mate! 4 weeks?

Of course, go bankrupt once. would think anyone stopping me? Ah ok. Maybe. another mutant shows up. Scary. Unfortunately UK wait longer. Wait gets bill. insurance, any, deny whole claim. delta it‚Äôs looking likely many vaccinated get it.

Mine body aches kept bed one day. Vaccinated wife never got it. 1 3 unvaccinated kids got it. Hence religiously wear mask whenever go inside public place. flu vaccine effective preventing severe disease, regularly [less 50% symptomatic disease, means also super-effective spreading flu.

There's misconception are, be, aiming absolutely minimum spread COVID. That's deal common respiratory viruses, accept level risk higher minimum could achieve encourage people higher risk get vaccine. That's we're going COVID. 

The virus continue mutate, since coronaviruses mutate slower flu, reasonable expect level spread, level danger vaccinated previously infected, eventually drop territory common cold viruses. 

Even Delta variant, closest ""vaccine breaker"" far, still much better controlled vaccine developed 16 months ago typical flu virus controlled vaccine developed 4 5 months exposure year. What's even worse would inject rhino piss regard side long term effects showed ability help perform better field.  they've failed lol wish nothing worst ever since immediately starter talking trash cowboys soon went bills OK.

Hopefully coworker recovers quickly. Haha crazy. may work places America right refuse service anybody instant asked leave that's tresspassing. fun :) I'll take it. Well, already did. Actually really vaccinate every country ASAP. Delta came population vaccinated, lambda, next variants.

We need global vaccination, even one shot. Otherwise continue see variants: epsilon, sigma, omicron, alligator... You‚Äôre clearly dead assume you‚Äôre hospital. Consider lucky vaccine stop that. intention vaccines never give sterilizing immunity. Grow take responsibility reason friends contracted Covid. people probably asymptomatic get infected.

The way think this: vaccinated get infected, get mildly sick vaccine job. vaccinated, would probably hospital. worse. say thing gets medical bill? That's I'm wondering. took whatever vaccine could get first. It'd suck lot I'm stuck less effective vaccine.  Yes, 95%, it‚Äôs what‚Äôs efficacy percentage means I'm getting second shot exactly 8 weeks. AWESOME. angry right now. sitting Johns Hopkins ER two idiots coughing without masks on. stunned. Delta reproduces extremely fast time antibodies produced i

WHere find info? trying math rate infection hard find direct info delta, besides ""it spreads fast"" That's usual path evolution take, go either way.  I‚Äôm hearing lot vaccinated people getting COVID

Based exclusively hospitals around country, 97% people admitted Covid symptoms unvaccinated, 99.5% Covid deaths also among unvaccinated.

From Vaccination protects getting seriously ill dying COVID-19. first fourteen days getting vaccination, significant levels protection, increases gradually. single dose vaccine, immunity generally occur two weeks vaccination. two-dose vaccines, doses needed achieve highest level **immunity possible.** I‚Äôm also hearing studies show vaccines highly effective Delta Variant.

The fact nobody 100% sure read scientific sources say vaccines **""still""** effective, yeah, defense right COVID vaccine.

You read [WHO Uhhh‚Ä¶ can. That‚Äôs CDC says matter anybody thinks... I'm fully vaccinated still rock mask. also live armpit unvaxinated midwest (Kansas) pretty close ground zero Missouri Arkansas shitstorm. 

You one body get new one. Take care however feel should. 

Also unvaxinated people around likelihood testing vaccine. Meanwhile literally can‚Äôt give away US.  close friend got Covid j&amp;j months ago contracted somewhere, gave one friends Pfizer shots followed protocol masks lifted vaccinated mask went away.

I've lightened mask usage outside still wear inside I'm carrying delta spread anyone.    Where???  would rather hospital weeks, rather get free shot. HUH??? wait till sees hospital bill Masks kill them.  Hard lockdown = whole country shuts like March 2020.

Soft lockdown = States insane surges cases shut down. literaly read article said space Pfizer's doses least eight weeks rather three weeks, immunity way stronger. Could reason? Since Israel used three weeks gap UK used 12 weeks gap?  Seriously, ""woe me"" attitude pathetic. really want something, fight disinformation apparently getting downvoted explaining [base-rate Sad. dont think Japan seen rich WESTERN county, Asian yes. talking elementary school kids, assholes. saw abstract 2 months ago said effective. research may changed since idk. keep wearing mask go wash hands. tested negative ER, yeah... theory doctor's theory could earlier asymptomatic infection (or symptoms mild notice) later caused PE.

This super weird, rarely sit desk longer hour recollection blood clots anywhere else body PE. UK data using questionable techniques good data. example, guessing variant people based prevalent particular area, applying Alpha variant age filters Delta variant Delta looks like worse young people tha Alpha.

Best answer far. That's true all. I've heard 80+ year old grandmother Indoniesa tested positive COVID family hysterical. I'm absolutely terrified well her.

Is anything could say family would help alleviate concerns feels like death sentence? Would really appreciate facts make us feel better. set certain limit critical coronavirus cases, say 60% ICU capacity, send people home capacity reached. Goodbye healthcare system  might end ""India"" variant again. full circle. Well, thats bad advice. dont change someone's mind shunning them. change someone trust giving sound, reasonable advice. Sure feels good morally superior dump people dont agree sever ties. one trying actually make positive change, must continue agent change. BTW double vaxxed Pfizer here, got fence Mom take vaxx exactly said. took path wouldnt vaccinated now. I'll stick way thinking acting. 

How many people changed minds someone went hateful them? I'll wait tabulate numbers. Come on. I'm trying civil discussion (really). need talk think kids socially normally school shuts get sick covid?

This implies schools shut *vaccinated* kids get sick COVID. assumption, obviously able socialize normally. assumption might necessarily hold true. specifically said **"" fully vaccinated manage contract disease""** - exactly misleading here? 
 
This relevant we're seeing breakthrough cases Delta variant. got vaccinated people thinking they're immune disease. comments literally thread.

Working healthcare (Texas ER) seems moderna effective pfizer. seen small number pfizer vaccinated folks Texas come tested positive Covid. Granted numbers teens purely anecdotal point - definitely getting sick unvaccinated (good news).  yet moderna vaccinated folks test positive.  food thought.  appears onto 3rd wave interesting see plays Yeah chills,muscle aches,achy bones,fatigue,and bad headache, sore arm redness around injection sote,my husband reaction slightly sore arm. think covid forever. question people going live it? It‚Äôs almost like there‚Äôs something suspicious going something. Huh. Oh will. virus spreads, mutates. may end truly vaccine resistant variant brings us back square one. Even happen, many citizens (vaccinated not) would end long covid health impacts tax healthcare systems many years come. immediate, hospitals full unable provide care need routine medicine, illnesses, accidents, etc. Schools continue shut down. Businesses struggle find enough healthy employees work. impacts us virus spreads unchecked. Well, COVID going end. going us end human history, like flu.

But pandemic end, case counts drop relatively low numbers becomes abundantly clear healthcare system safe handle pace infection indefinitely, vaccines become available everyone world next several years. got AZ moderna 8 weeks later.

if got second pfizer moderna shot would likely much higher immunity... This. spent entire year caring. Stayed inside, mental health deteriorated, times go groceries, wore mask, social distanced (even though people follow 6 foot rule). Nobody cared me. People walked right behind without mask walked dog. spent entire pandemic feeling hopeless angry people. got vaccinated, stopped giving fucks. turn put first. can't spend rest life worrying someone get vaccinated despite vaccines widely available everyone. entire sub one giant fucking echo chamber - joke!! üòÇüòÇüòÇ hospitals overwhelmed (in instances) without vaccines.

That's probably gonna case upcoming winter. point vaccines immunization prospective disease... not? change? ""immunization schedules,"" ""vaccines lessen severity disease we're vaccinating scheduels."" vaccinate actual immunity, correct? lied to?

Polio vaccine didnt give minor polio symptoms instance somehow contracting it... granted immunity eradicated polio. Kinda weird, no? wondering... Preach human.   Good point Hold would suggestion.

Everybody know vaccinated seems dealing cold, included, could rona could immune systems starting back freeing face. exciting targets 3 spike proteins opposed 1 might even effective variants. However, heck test Israel spread likely bad due high vaccination rates. Would make sense test Florida. Western Europe people getting vaccinated high degree, seems. Germany seems bit worse, still good. Spain, Britain Nordic countries ave high rates. Parts eastern Europe, though, low rates.

Hopefully becomes clear thinking wait out. 4 weeks apart enough  SIERRA HOTEL INDIA ECHO LIMA DELTA mean.. generally increases aggression bonus plus effects set joints almost used anyway.. symptoms mean spread.

Covids superpower spreading without symptoms, goes vaccinated spreaders well.

A vaccinated person less risky, infected spread risk - with, without, symptoms. realize hundreds diseases viruses could suffer permanent damage would higher risk getting covid? can‚Äôt risk tolerance 0. Canada too. Changes noticed, need taken seriously Also, sorry meant respond comment another user. Reddit app...

I agree vaccine taking bit longer kick time, (see comment), still suspicious study. makes fearful, surprised, Delta variant mutated past current iteration vaccine. bound happen Replication (Covid-Œ±), yet expecting occur 2021. fact wealthier countries hoarded vaccine patents instead spreading vaccine guaranteed outcome. India merely start shitshow face. Happy winter; may last.

Or someone else‚Äôs life.  

Vaccine aged persons far less likely infect others. Broad based vaccination reduces transmission rates. Also important keep mind movie, commercial, television studios/sets allowed continue operating agreement implement pretty extreme safety measures include daily testing every person set. huge portion workforce LA. 

Every vaccinated person know time tested positive covid tested working set. Four people total, three symptoms one bad headache. Anecdotal, know.

This simple, rocket science people.

Do want kids safe not? ""In Texas, 99.5% people died COVID February July 14 vaccinated, per Texas Tribune's reporting preliminary data Texas Department State Health Services.""

Very people Texas fully vaccinated back February going surge. Seems like would useful compare deaths past week month get meaningful percentage rate effective mRNA vaccines like Pfizer Moderna. Ever since got J&amp;J vaccine nothing bad news J&amp;J good news Pfizer. wife got Pfizer April J&amp;J March. antibody test Labcorp day. 850 U/mL (on scale 0 2,500) count 85. unclear exactly many antibodies needed immunity, seeing mine low give whole lot confidence vaccine. least antibodies, that's good guess. enema?

What I'm saying new strain showing ability poke entirely vaccinated bubbles. time, happening. vaccinated people exposed (at much reduced rate though), need know still get severely ill die virus. Even common flu still vaccinated. Depends vaccination strategy. countries went trying get many people double vaccinated, soon first wave first shot people waited long enough (3-5 weeks depending vaccines organization) priority ones shots.       
In Canada example, aim cover many people one shot. Initially, wait 12 weeks get second shot, 8 weeks now. Go get second dose. 1 shot much less effective COVID worse vaccine reaction going get. assume similar Moderna vaccine well? Many schools saying longer students quarantine unless positive test. So, symptoms trigger quarantine nevermind contacts. Yes. So, would *they* allow it? considered misinformation contributed spread Delta?

Luckily, masking made flu season non-existent, think going masking nearly much winter. seems least may heading bad winter.  I‚Äôve read lot Pfizer efficacy variants, estimation needed boosters.

Moderna seems disappeared wormhole.

Why? Prior vaccine rollout, always discussed breath. like thought üëå According research UK, optimum time spread dose 8 weeks, gives best immune responses. currently medical conditions recognized either FDA CDC prevent vaccination waste medical resources anarcocapitalist, want agree you.

Y'all act like people never sick before. Dutch use 8 week gap. end somewhere middle, answer absolutely people see choose vaccinated it.

People gone long without getting jab swayed dumbass saw TV 30 seconds. already decided get it.  I'm almost 50 never flu vaccine life.

Bruh reddit like that‚Ä¶  vaccination site, whether pharmacy, doctor's office, etc ask questions health see whether contraindications getting second shot.
That said, neither CDC UK website state contraindications getting second shot dental procedures.
I think schedule second shot recommended timeline, reschedule dental procedure shot thing pathologists work lab. apologist, sayin‚Äô I'm mistaken, NFL players get game checks Sundays, get paid 17 weeks year. think. Maybe end getting sooner. Great White North going four months shots ended two even less now. Covid never gone rather become endemic, point is, take it, wear masks indefinitely.

How heck ever eradicate disease past? population smarter compassionate? mind answering couple questions? not:

When 30-day period up?

Do know everyone booster trial roughly 30 day period might actually take longer 30 days complete?

Did side effects booster (more less dose 2)?

Sadly shelf life rather short, manufactured distributed, shots either end arm trash. vaccines target original coronavirus, Alpha. Alpha exist yet developed. Legit question. anyone believe strengthening immune system naturally. conspiracy anti vaxer natural hippy shit. Surprised one talks that. Like solution vaccine? guys odd bunch.

Nah, EU East nothing like US South, apart religion bit.

Juan (horse balcony) much EU East trope, line Florida Man. really hurt develop science solutions preparation? I‚Äôd rather boosters developed might necessary wait see. necessarily. Mutations happen random. Every time virus replicates cell theres small chance mutation occuring. 

Most mutations nothing value virus keep replicated effect. 

The mutations harm virus' ability spread obviously die replicate.

The mutations increase virus' ability spread new hosts new cells proliferate eventually become dominant.

A virus replicate tens thousands times single host cell, every host millions potential host cells, mutations happen variant virus, though chances Delta since dominant variant spreading around right now.

When we're looking every single person infected providing virus trillions opportunities replicate mutate little bit process, chances mutation helps virus spread overpower/ work around immunity conferred vaccine increases, like said... random chance, look far come already. 2/3 India antibodies! shows delta variant went everywhere. spreading false information  already case lambda texas. already. agree. amount risk someone already taking terms themself spread community going crowded area already high. need passports first vaccinating, robust data. UK data seems confirm. can‚Äôt show cdc fed gov said variant cannot transmitted vaccinated though vaccines become available. They've months months get dosed beforehand. nominate call ioc variant  models shown.  tell ""The New York Post"" claims instead.  ""I get vaccinated virulent disease that's caused long-term pandemic millions deaths literally reason to"" pretty good argument though kids ability vaccinated, essentially over. you, even feel like make long.

Pfizer gang  IIRC calculations put herd immunity threshold 100% population delta even thing. We'd likely need 100% vaccinate entire planet MRNA reach herd immunity. endgame probably vaccinate whoever wants make cases overwhelm medical system people get vaccine go private homeschool! still choice vaccinated, can't use specific public service do

Again, time history legal force adults get vaccine whether want not. I'm dense dude, uninformed Yeah. work healthcare. I‚Äôve done everything right still caught delta Europe (where masks still highly prevalent) must contagious. fact athletes heavy training sometimes need days rest recuperate lets muscles heal, especially heavily tested athletes can't use aid performance / recovery enhancers.   Source last summer? [Wikipedia says detected early Yeah? go medical school, get board certified immunology? they've option months now, like recently available worry would disrupt lead prep side effects. one last groups qualify got like 5 months ago took maybe 20 minutes one large scale administering locations.  Yes said day. coming brother sees Las Vegas health dashboard (physician there) basically Nevada hum ho tracking breakthrough Oklahoma shit together. 25-34, nearly twice age risk bit higher due age. mostly likely die due COVID, certainly higher risk expensive time consuming hospitalization convalescence.  Especially Delta, damn transmissable. one reason got vaccinated.

But also get rather New Testament issue. 
Why hard people understand taking vaccine YOU, people surround with?  would rather take infinitesimal risk personal injury return risking people around potentially life altering disease.  many people forgotten Golden Rule? politics clouded people's mind Bible many claim read follow daily basis? Seriously??? Aren‚Äôt travel restrictions quarantine requirements? thought Japan wasn‚Äôt allowing people enter US all, obviously there‚Äôs exception Olympians, I‚Äôd think they‚Äôd still require quarantine unvaccinated since they‚Äôre letting in. Oh wow! Let's hope leads great treatment. friend REALLY suffering. Ty much sharing sent article. gives hope! bet anti-vaxxers afraid ‚Äúlong term side effects‚Äù YEARS drink every even smoke never question long term side effects literally deadly. Victoria crushed Delta crushing again. NSW seriously dragged feet locking down, state uncontrolled spread wants every state give vaccines. company going put employees front line enforcing that. much risk employee. effectively given point vaccinated catching, carrying transmitting Delta variant COVID-19, vast majority carriers totally asymptomatic really getting sick all, still acting carriers.

The messaging is... difficult... inherent politicalization whole topic combined nuance fact vaccinations (almost always) protect significant sickness protecting well live virus carrier.

The vaccines useless. saving hundreds thousands millions lives people vaccinated, preventing spread nearly enough protect unvaccinated low percentage full breakthrough cases vaccinated person build enough immunity get fully sick despite vaccination.

They‚Äôre probably banking full FDA approval, fears twindemic, current media coverage Delta, and/or people likely wanting see family holidays safely get vaccine fence-sitters roll new sleeves. 

The endgame probably vaccinate whoever wants try keep cases low enough doesn‚Äôt overwhelm healthcare system. Yeah. Rabies alone 4. Two hep hep b, yellow fever, plus boosters childhood ones. might actually 12. cares. guess. last week fine. None group tested positive (and active), handful people know went tested positive, none symptoms.

Well, yes, course I'm ignoring spread back home towns discussion many athletes die.

You want talk that? I'm sure there's lots threads talking that. one them. There's 200,000-300,000 shots given daily US. That's huge demand. stick landing. know long term issues?

Goal post move. poster clearly said athletes. statement deaths used word athlete.

Sure, 80 year old overweight IOC big wig contracted dying? Yeah, see possibility. know many 60+ unvaccinated coaches running around. I'm speaking that, though.

I'm also going say Paraolympics also scope. Mostly seen vaccination numbers them, also really know scope potential high risk factors. article also next issue number unvaccinated.

About 2000 Olympic athletes. top issue multiple strains potential new strain emerging. 

A new variant could pop anytime. had, what, 4 total variants concern? that's hundreds millions cases. Even 50k people congregating, rounding error risk new estimate vaccinations 2/3rds,

I told number. believe me, Google first estimating. ""80 olympics vaccination,"" 2nd link athletes (1st version article looking 6-10 athlete deaths.

So using (incorrect) 3600 unvaccinated athletes, that's IFR 0.167% 0.278%. rather, 1 600 1 360.

Those numbers FAR high age range question. Even without considering high risk factors lower rates general population.

There's lot ways skin IFR cat. [I like IFR numbers accurate, 85+ would 25% 100% chance dying. know that's true. least factor 10, likely like 100 would argue would miracle athletes didn‚Äôt die

I'm sure know enough that. internet since vaccines came out?

And I've people actually ask got vaccinated already LOL. check local subreddit St.Lois, seem happy all. Apparently Governor signed law preventing orders like going 30 days? anyone local confirm? Hopefully people pushed vaccinated.  I'm LA county, 99% hospitalizations among unvaxxed, reinstated mask mandate. Anti vaxxers absolutely exploded ""see?? vaccines work!"". Even pro vaxx people know confused beginning question safety efficacy vaccines. whole mess.

Is really confusing? can't get anti-vaxers wear mask unless require everyone wear one becuase they'll lie.

Okay, agree (and think mentioned response). there's economic pressure I'd mentioned... cases falling drastically, wife MIGHT gone concert. looked tickets various shows fall winter...

But now? HELLLL no. we're New Jersey positive #'s still relatively low. thought would get better has, kids age 6 9 vaccinated, we're avoiding things like that.

Background 
There growing concern possible cognitive consequences COVID-19, reports ‚ÄòLong COVID‚Äô symptoms persisting chronic phase case studies revealing neurological problems severely affected patients. However, little information regarding nature broader prevalence cognitive problems post-infection across full spread disease severity.

 
Methods 
We sought confirm whether association cross-sectional cognitive performance data 81,337 participants January December 2020 undertook clinically validated web-optimized assessment part Great British Intelligence Test, questionnaire items capturing self-report suspected confirmed COVID-19 infection respiratory symptoms.

 
Findings 
People recovered COVID-19, including longer reporting symptoms, exhibited significant cognitive deficits versus controls controlling age, gender, education level, income, racial-ethnic group, pre-existing medical disorders, tiredness, depression anxiety. deficits substantial effect size people hospitalised (N = 192), also non-hospitalised cases biological confirmation COVID-19 infection (N = 326). Analysing markers premorbid intelligence support differences present prior infection. Finer grained analysis performance across sub-tests supported hypothesis COVID-19 multi-domain impact human cognition.

 
Interpretation 
Interpretation. results accord reports ‚ÄòLong Covid‚Äô cognitive symptoms persist early-chronic phase. act clarion call research longitudinal neuroimaging cohorts plot recovery trajectories identify biological basis cognitive deficits SARS-COV-2 survivors.

Retagged Good News :-) talking - b/c that's said. Yeah. Theyre healthy everyone claims. exercising definitely help fall ill. Elite athletes get flu often done season. knew racer sidelined two weeks took year regain fitness lost time. (They still extremely fast good time, winning races anymore.)

""Long covid"" potentially causes scarring fibrosis would likely put Olympic contention life. strikes extremely irresponsible selfish saying study ignored obvious selection effect generated choosing get vaccine? i.e., people risk likely get vaccine (e.g., people older health issues). Therefore, simple comparison infection rates vaccinated unvaccinated going bias results towards estimating lower vaccine effectiveness. Seems like something even undergraduate statistician would know avoid. adult highest flu (102.7), got something else...

I idea matter hours went feeling completely fine blowing past 105 hallucinating badly imagine Czech team sent doctor that‚Äôs unvaccinated course COVID-19 cases team sent home Czech doesn‚Äôt even lack vaccines astra ,Pfizer moderna anyone wants get one   Christ really gone peoples heads huh.

Uncontrolled spread?! It‚Äôs less 200 cases, virus people either asymptomatic bad cold. zero covid approach completely unsustainable There's evolutionary pressure here.

Evolution cares whether people able pass genes, someone breeding age, virus extremely unlikely kill them. could kill elderly parents grandparents, evolution care them.

If virus like original SARS, killed large numbers young people, *might* slight evolutionary pressure. (but probably enough real impact).

This big part it...where's endpoint? cynical, simply realistic believing among anti-vaxx crowd, many likely least exposed Covid point ever get vaccine. meantime, following restrictive measures may provide (and close you) extra layer protection, going halt spread. Children 12 quite low risk. Vaccinated individuals still generally low risk (and everyone make choice risk take). Unvaccinated people protect themselves. 

Bottom line (and could wrong): ""larger portion population"" going get vaccinated. wish extra cautious wave subsides (whenever may be), one stopping you. hold breath waiting sizeable chunk currently unvaccinated ""see light"" sudden. Per Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) used collect reports adverse events vaccination general public. primarily used identify potential topics investigate regards vaccine reactions.

Taipei, July 23 (CNA) Taiwan Friday reported 24 new COVID-19 infections -- 23 transmitted domestically one contracted overseas -- laid updated disease control measures prepares lower nationwide Level 3 COVID-19 alert Level 2 July 27.

Of domestic cases, 13 reported New Taipei, four Taipei Taoyuan, one Yilan Kaohsiung, according Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC).

Only five patients apparent link previously confirmed COVID-19 cases, Taiwan seen cases remain single digits week, indicating situation control, said CECC chief, Health Minister Chen Shih-chung (Èô≥ÊôÇ‰∏≠) daily press briefing.

He said current Level 3 restrictions relaxed allow reopening businesses venues ordered close since COVID-19 cases began surging mid-May, well gatherings many 50 people indoors 100 outdoors.

Under current Level 3 alert, part four-tier system, gatherings four people indoors nine outdoors banned, schools entertainment venues closed, in-person dining restaurants prohibited.

The CECC eased restrictions July 13, allowing libraries, movie theaters, gyms reopen restaurants serve customers on-site.

But businesses remained closed, local governments rejected CECC's guidance in-person dining fear could lead spread disease.

""Despite easing restrictions, existing border controls remain place, Chen said, though consideration given loosening quarantine requirements people entering Taiwan abroad received two doses COVID-19 vaccine.""

The new cases reported Friday bring total country 15,535, 14,064 domestic infections reported since May 15, country first recorded 100 COVID-19 cases single day.

The one imported case Croatian boy 10, traveled Taiwan Switzerland June 28 tested positive disease Friday, CECC said.

Meanwhile, two deaths reported, man 60s woman 80s, according CECC.
To date, 784 people died COVID-19 Taiwan, including 772 since May 15.

True, especially disease like Covid, takes time kills infected person.

With something terrifying Spanish Flu, person could wake feeling fine, feel sniffly lunch time, suffocate fluids midnight die multiple organ failure days later. 

Covid infects person, might even show symptoms several weeks first started infecting cells, even symptoms may appear mild first gradually worsen expire several weeks later. 

The worst hit areas early days pandemic suffered virus spreading unseen several weeks first person showed symptoms, end week would thousands people flooding hospitals due silently explosive disease be.

We **need** protection transmission though, otherwise live state perpetual pandemic - need produce sterilizing immunity, even 70-80% enough vaccinated population would effectively curb spread. Look e.g. [Brazilian town \- numbers starting infections ending deaths declined drastically.

Don't also forget stuff like long COVID. Protection hospitalizations deaths bad ofc strive more. That's I'm saying need data. Portugal seeing similar trend cases plateauing week. particularly interesting compare wave second wave October. Besides obvious improvements deaths hospitalizations, also seeing less steep rise cases (we plateauing 3500 cases second wave reached 6000 cases). dealing variant lot transmissible original October. Sad can‚Äôt use science based approach. interesting see happens Delta safety measures place.

It‚Äôs unfair kids going forced back school governor wants play politics. hope people understand means we'll forever

You need break transmission cycle. need scare people enough want take every possible precaution. many cases, happened. Entitlement, talking heads cable channels, allowed people behave like big deal. Yeah missed boat zero COVID back dec 2019 correlate age? Like older, likely infected, likely reduce cognitive scores.  UK Cases going last 3 days. 15,000 cases Last friday. fingers crossed continues.

""The number new COVID cases UK fallen third day row, according government data.

The country recorded 36,389 new cases 64 coronavirus-related deaths latest 24-hour period.

The number infections 15,000 compared time last week, 51,870 reported along 49 deaths.

Yesterday, 39,906 infections 84 fatalities announced."" Yeah, huge problem. EU countries like 98% elderly vaccinated Germany might see multiple times per capita hospitalizations deaths fall/winter. Hm. am. I‚Äôm 36 year old dad life pretty much different anyway think going hybrid model similar already existed add airplane travel.

Once approved, require high transmission settings. schools (just like measles vaccines), colleges, nursing homes, etc.

Require high risk jobs like hospitals, nursing homes, maybe teachers, etc.

And require fly. It‚Äôs already going requirement international travel foreseeable future. extended domestic air travel, would fairly easy enforce.

On fence: large gatherings like concerts.

Endgame: reaches infection level similar childhood diseases vaccinate like measles. guess international might permanent requirement travel (vaccines already mandated travel areas).   expand players. since first shot wish scared gave alot anxiety.

Wouldn't surprise symptoms got reading 

(I bad health anxiety anxiety manifests pshyical symptoms especially read something) 

Getting 2nd today !  vaccination thing tactic. What‚Äôs overarching objective want accomplish that? zero Covid manageable Covid? New variants mutating daily, guaranteed. Thankfully successful. 

The people get infected chances mutate. 

It‚Äôs evolution, plain simple.  mean simple using app scanning QR code

Who going stop entering scan fails? You? volunteering? volunteering minimum wage employees risk safety?

There practical means enforcement. nice pie sky ideas - practicality enforcement there. hope freaks people enough get vaccinated steamroll way herd. fully vaccinated (Pfizer), mum tested positive covid 14th month doctors concluded delta variant. 
I staying house, taking precautions like wearing masks indoors, using tons alcohol lysol etc... 1h ago received results last test, came back negative. 
It's worthless. Booster shots. Imagine 100% NFL, MLB NBA players got vaccinated, would motivate millions get vaccinated save life‚Äôs guys drawing line enjoying life overly cautious? measurements suggest? add overall number people got vaccinated not. imagine would 10000 vaccinated people 100 not. 100 unvaccinated get Covid 200 vaccinated. see absolute numbers people vaccinated not, might come wrong conclusion getting vaccinated makes twice likely get Covid. Pre-covid, typical weekend would going concert play club see dj. None back used yet. really understand hard this. required EVERYONE involved Olympics capacity fully vaccinated. simple. takes long die covid, infectious long infected, selective pressure become less deadly.

On top that, selective pressure become deadly, something like higher viral load causes become contagious deadly. Absolutely!

I think analysis valid seniors building constantly removing comparison freshman much obedient. Exactly.

And transparently stupid.

If large amounts breakthrough cases resulting extremely mild infection denominator important people know stories severe infections breakthrough cases.  **What LA county thinks unvaccinated like now:** ""Wow, masks reinstated?

In fact, things make contagious deadly, like higher viral load. That's Delta has, btw.   True. I‚Äôm exactly spot moment, guess referring every day things. exactly right though. rate world forget Australia New Zealand even exist  takes half year vaccine become essentially worthless?

Note protection-against-transmission much different protection-against-severed-disease.. first metric could near zero 2nd could still high.. wearing mask many times easier things.

Exactly. People acting like side effects all. bad side effects well related autoimmune condition I'm still dealing (and still waiting get immunologist, ffs).

The vaccine widely available US since April, 3 months Olympics would expect they're training hard for. 2 weeks missed training could set back especially events lost tenths hundreds second.

I'd wearing K-95 mask whenever go isolate non-vaccinated people. That, plus fact olympic class athletes young fit much lower risk covid general.

I 100% pro vax would despite issues. need able talk like reasonable people instead thinking people specific situations vaccinated idiots.  game cancelled/postponed club cannot play due Covid spike among resulting non-vaccinated players/staff, burden cancellation delay fall club experiencing Covid infection.

That say *player* responsible, says team unvaxxed player responsible. reading right?

I'm sure teams pass burden directly player not.

As economist kinda like solution. choose unvaccinated, cause outbreak, you, personally, responsible salary *every* player involved teams. Charge people externalities, that's great.

Wow, like listening Newsmax OAN. Summary 
Background 
The COVID-19 pandemic priorities focused prevention, detection, response. Beyond morbidity mortality, pandemics carry secondary impacts, children orphaned bereft caregivers. children often face adverse consequences, including poverty, abuse, institutionalisation. provide estimates magnitude problem resulting COVID-19 describe need resource allocation. 
Methods 
We used mortality fertility data model minimum estimates rates COVID-19-associated deaths primary secondary caregivers children younger 18 years 21 countries. considered parents custodial grandparents primary caregivers, co-residing grandparents older kin (aged 60‚Äì84 years) secondary caregivers. avoid overcounting, adjusted possible clustering deaths using estimated secondary attack rate age-specific infection‚Äìfatality ratios SARS-CoV-2. used estimates model global extrapolations number children experienced COVID-19-associated deaths primary secondary caregivers. 
Findings 
Globally, March 1, 2020, April 30, 2021, estimate 1‚Äâ134‚Äâ000 children (95% credible interval 884‚Äâ000‚Äì1‚Äâ185‚Äâ000) experienced death primary caregivers, including least one parent custodial grandparent. 1‚Äâ562‚Äâ000 children (1‚Äâ299‚Äâ000‚Äì1‚Äâ683‚Äâ000) experienced death least one primary secondary caregiver. Countries study set primary caregiver death rates least one per 1000 children included Peru (10¬∑2 per 1000 children), South Africa (5¬∑1), Mexico (3¬∑5), Brazil (2¬∑4), Colombia (2¬∑3), Iran (1¬∑7), USA (1¬∑5), Argentina (1¬∑1), Russia (1¬∑0). Numbers children orphaned exceeded numbers deaths among aged 15‚Äì50 years. two five times children deceased fathers deceased mothers. 
Interpretation 
Orphanhood caregiver deaths hidden pandemic resulting COVID-19-associated deaths. Accelerating equitable vaccine delivery key prevention. Psychosocial economic support help families nurture children bereft caregivers help ensure institutionalisation avoided. data show need additional pillar response: prevent, detect, respond, care children.

Germany also introduce health passes. right now. would enough beginning next year. think many hardcore anti-vaxxers Germany. adults vaccinated far normal kinds idiots. easily convinced get next vaccination center, going might result slight complications life easier get vaccinated.

I also suspect new vaccinations decreasing last two weeks, summer holidays now. People go vacation people prioritize getting vaccinated. 

The still quite low case numbers right likely also decrease hurry unvaccinated people feel. Thank easing mindüòä Depends was. say, New York, vaccinations high cases low, I‚Äôd opt longer interval since seems provide slightly stronger long term protection. 

If Missouri, cases *really* high, vaccination lower, would quickly possible. like come meet greets old people towns.  group 10 girls bachelorette last weekend, 1 tests positive 2 days later. vaccinated, got J&amp;J vaccine. went bar SF one night. One girl rapid antigen tested negative PCR came back positive (second girl got Pfizer). symptoms, J&amp;J much worse Pfizer. girls including tested negative antigen PCR we‚Äôre getting tested Monday.

There things covered, course, things not. restrictions based behavior.  Get vaccine.

Yes, first cases VA Maryland Nile River Cruise. even released data form Israeli study?   Well, know getting much transmissible. recent studies show Delta¬†is considerably virulent - nearly 5 times many contract require oxygen, ICU admission  Basically opinion question: 

If unvaccinated planned get Pfizer terms, would space doses 3 weeks, 12 weeks, something between?

Obviously delta rise want vaccination sooner, there's increasing concern 12 week spacing may effective (depending much stock put Israel v. UK differences, imperfect). would do? (Another option: 3 weeks &amp; plan booster?)  crossroads whether stupidly unvaxxed going get unstupid anytime soon. consequence, sure, reality, people would affect elderly, children 12, immunocompromised, percentage fully vaccinated people altogether also giving way variants.

You heard Lambda variant spreading Peru? [Because that's  wonder extremely strict lockdowns bad thing. less contagious variants you‚Äôd immunity previous infection low vaccinations almost one exposed? sounds like recipe disaster. genetic? Probably not. means type thing gonna us while. Way go, Asians! every state seems higher percentage vaccinations share total population. I'm currently 12%. Miserable sick bed. basically point know getting weaker stronger.  Sure, is, requirement ought mandatory. anyone actually think need boosters??? 

The best studies ever said ""well we're 6 months still works"". many reporters took wrote ""works well past 6 months, boosters likely"" clickbait headlines. boosters likely knock 95% efficacy. Seasonal flu shots 50-60% effective, Covid boosters easy sell. say ‚Äúshould‚Äù we‚Äôve got lot idiots US. germany aim around 5-6 weeks. Got first Pfizer shot yesterday, second shot scheduled September 2nd. get vaccinated still completely cautions it? can‚Äôt wrap head arount train thought factor moving forward sure. 3 week gap going trouble without boosters.

Outside described questionable data Israel without state ever releasing raw data, make conclusion on? Meanwhile every vaccine tested antibody levels, adequate antibody levels, redose. going go athletes lost lives due Coronavirus.

Do actually think that's likely event?

Because 80%+ vaccinated (across countries) top myriad precautions (most notably routine testing), HIGHLY unlikely even single athlete going die.

Sure, there's going articles X athlete got infected. we're lucky, major competitors, probably get infected obviously sucks even even chase medals. what's option? Delay another year probably even larger set athletes get compete got year old. Japanese officials agreed risk citizens health save face

Gave ammo people trying equate Trump getting Twitter banned lying this. 88% great efficacy, come number. people say, ‚Äúwell isn‚Äôt 100% effective, get it?‚Äù weren‚Äôt going get vaccine anyway. want excuse point to. 88% beats hell 50-60% efficacy see seasonal flu vaccine. run that. Moderna brand name US vaccine yet? know names often different different regions world (i.e. almost certainly called SpikeVax states)

I know technical name vaccine heard branding outside ""Moderna"" obviously makes drug drug itself. asked ""How would manage?""

I gave answer. I'm sure quibbling now. catches virus would separate self continuation one? Remember, former athlete wore olympic jacket Jan 6 country live in? Especially dead kids Wrong. solution bullying? Teach kid beat serious ass. used get bullied constantly years, way highschool freshman year. Guess fuck stopped forever? beat someones ass front entire hallway people. Bullying never went past ""hey friends, I'm gunna talk shit friendly way"" ever again. Noone stole anything me. Noone ever pushed over. knew wasnt going fucking tolerate anymore. VIOLENCE answer many things admit it. good answer? wish wasnt, is. Good post. Informative without shaming. ""Even one death many! care people heartless monster!""

Etc.

There hyperbole sides.  Gotta careful type burritos eat. really.

~22% (74 million) voted trump.

Is killing really _easier_ voting him?

I know seems like talk like children excluded, not, feel free it, imaginary 10% that.

now, still clear present threat, makes sense _that many_. they're overrepresented, because, ya know, racism. way handle needles look. first Pfizer dose, felt little bit. second dose, feel thing all. Thankfully bit arm pain following day otherwise would've thought nurse playing cruel joke me. well guess that‚Äôs 100 less athletes catch it‚Ä¶ Get boosters approved, now!  2.7
Edit: 2X alpha correct then. work bar city notified us vaccinated guest tested COVID positive day.

I shifts tonight tomorrow. feel fine. 

Sigh. There's massive communitiy spread pathogen. That's normal. 

It's called pandemic. yet.  take flight there...  would huge backlash plus optics would look terrible giving ammunition anti-vaxxers Republicans attack Biden message ""See? He's failing COVID!"". know mom thinks vaccine is: untested, potentially dangerous, risky, unnatural, scary, maybe dangerous. 

She feels control safety socially distancing. conspiracy theory among conspiracy theorists, also anti-mask, anti social distancing, anti lockdowns anti-vaccine. rest us would like end point. (and still *if* trend becomes established) UK cases peak quite quickly, it'll high levels immunity.

More 90% population antibodies. 88% adults one vaccine, 70% two.

Anywhere world lower vaccination levels, especially vaccination levels amongst vulnerable (it's 99% vaccine take-up 70+ age ranges) still needs watch get move-on vaccination programmes.   honestly disgusts me. sad :( make up? Florida Covid #s bad worse point pandemic. people fucking idiots. give even smallest fucks wins event Olympics all. None sports exhibit interest hearing ""Oooh country took home X medals"" means even less.  No, heard fine. too.  bad Delta apparently Sick exposure two monstrously different things Whatever comes called Olympic variant crime vaccines expiring many people sick dying needlessly. appear live post-rationality society. Hello, Dark Ages: Redux.

We probably start seeing measles whooping cough mumps momentum idiocy keeps up.  FUCK REQUIREMENT?  needle anxiety too, overcame fear anyway! Better getting covid say. ... also pretty big blind spot if/when vaccines start decline efficacy waning immunity new variant. ok endemic virus that‚Äôs (generally) made mild via vaccine (at least line virus)?

We choice point. COVID endemic. work get COVID vaccine. One lady even get flu shot.  unaware, elder care staff often populated unsavory medical staff. usually positive patient outcomes forefront practice. common sense find highest congregation unvaccinated healthcare employees amongst demographic, sadly. wondering Israel‚Äôs gap doses? Seems like results always different. Got downvoted somewhere else Reddit saying extremely unlikely NFL player die year Covid. reported 13,000 cases today. fucked here. UK-based Zero Covid people co-ordinated group called Citizens: they're ""PR consultants"" Independent SAGE, also work Deepti Gurdasani (who member Independent SAGE).

As see Twitter account, they're political pressure group planning using Covid means achieving political goals.

Cases declining early (even real SAGE expect another couple weeks) worst nightmare they've bet much cases continuing rise summer.

They even manifesto they're open tactics: bullied dozens non-affiliated scientists (who previously sharing genuinely useful information) Twitter, fear unable continue day job become ""the story"". ""crime"" scientists disagreeing Gurdasani's many errors. Well sooo get one shot can't compete wait weeks get 2nd? world difference saying recommended versus cause long term organ damage. whether recommended needed (which scientific consensus) cause harm (which proven) live US. There's really nothing get people get vaccinated, outside fully approving least one vaccine- that's MAYBE. Much remaining unvaccinated population much anti-COVID vaccination. work outside patio restaurant 95 degree heat (soon 100+), running tail 6-12 hours. fan masks, started wearing one yesterday. interact dozens people every day - got infected became contagious (which think happens breakthrough infections) could single-handedly cause cluster. I'd rather risk it. Yeah spread less fortunate countries vaccinated thus gives team america advantage. live here. I'm very, angry. end many cases sniffles data (or informed predictions) effects immune system asymptomatic mild breakthrough infection? 

My basic lay understanding leads belive breakthrough infection would serve almost booster immunity conferred vax? Deaths also lagging indicator month Speak yourself. 2 year old getting day it‚Äôs approved age group. I‚Äôm tired assholes wearing masks around child Lol. No.

It would motivate ‚Äúboycott‚Äù

Meaning say boycotting twitter continue watch buy merch. look transmissibility? vaccines supposed provide herd immunity 39% vaccinated getting infected, herd immunity. Objectively tracking long Covid incredibly difficult anyways. many symptoms vary length, nearly impossible nail exactly measure real way. people medical community considers pariah may cause rethink things bit

You clearly talked people types. kind thing makes dig in.   B.C. resident here. two months two doses. think every parent disagrees here? think parents still wanting restrictions (vocal) minority. know, I'm fully expecting us back \~300,000 cases/day Rochelle Walensky tearfully pleading nation cancel Thanksgiving celebrations etc. comment history, appears live Australia. Canada. Compare lagging recent lag compare current deaths cases weeks back... near death rate last wave.  could change, won't. 

Have ever South Dakota. one conservative states entire country.

This state runs on

* God
* Guns
* Conservatism
* Hating liberals (aka anyone think like them, act like look like them, aka evangelical white Christians)

The vast majority people tied political beliefs everyday life. ""Trump shops"" prime example. 

The state government fuck anything up. Fucking something implies tried something, didn't. downplayed entire situation point South Dakota top nation positive cases per capita (South Dakota one least populated states country). 

The government state one corrupt country ([the state legislature actually overturned anti-corruption bill basis voters know doing. fact Democrats support things like mask mandate automatically make non-negotiable thing. 

I work retail here, amount times we've yelled enforcing mask mandate store way numerous count. co-workers yelled at, cussed at, etc hate needles too, literally even know given injections. you‚Äôve already J&amp;J, go back get Pfizer/Moderna?  Clearly comment aimed unvaccinated.  tired, little achy, slight fever day second dose. Around dinner time day dose 2, felt fine. 

Have felt adverse effects aside that. got second shot February. heard somewhere Delta really cause loss taste smell like alpha og does? 100% sure that's true. seems less common either case. definitely good news, question good news Tbh stopped paying much attention news Israel. inconsistent times completely contradict EU, US, Canada. Hell would even dumber get long covid kills careers !RemindMe 1 month World class athlete basically 0 chance ventilator covid lol can't even board dog without proof vaccination. Nah, feel like need keep spreading stupid.  guess think thing. 

Explain anything said effectiveness wearing masks. Specifically context told wear masks weren‚Äôt effective.

How travels air nothing wear mask, that‚Äôs posted even talking pandemic talking years testing different masks respiratory viruses. Brazil declares Olympics back on! believes statistics falsely pointing poor vaccine performance harmful, make people reluctant take shots.  hurts compliance people vaccinations,‚Äù said. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre saying public vaccines work less, hurts enthusiasm them.‚Äù

It also seems like maybe agenda? also actively explain 'false' study either ""small sample size"". also clear many/most criticism CDC coming experts think different endpoint.

SO MUCH THIS. people clamoring zero Covid policies detached people willing get there. virulent is, would commit worldwide lockdown forced vaccination drive, would never happen. 

Endemic goal, get vaccinated becomes another cold/flu strain. could go wrong? /s Hospital treatments still great sadly. vaccines good preventing death. know delta variant? That's far smart US government implement Even mild long covid (let‚Äôs say normal energy levels 90% slight persistent respiratory issues) would definitely detriment elite athletes would Joe blow Coronaviruses never eradicated natural reservoir animal populations. Diseases eradicated like smallpox don't. lack logic since provided single citation back claims everything said complete opposite CDC. TROLL.

Goodbye. Nope. mRNA target spike varients thus far have. Inactive virus vaccines seem bit virus specific, lose effectiveness different varients much easily. least general idea.  following YET. I‚Äôm yelling people still haven‚Äôt realized quickly medical resources run another big surge. think nurses doctors died first round magically replaced? protective gear replaced bed capacity vent capacity increased? 


Everything stretched thin medical capacity. 

There breaking point like Texas energy crisis minutes away completely failing killing thousand led tens thousands. Yea like isn‚Äôt gonna cause problem ‚Ä¶
Some countries making mandatory get vaccinated (unless condition poor health young)

All ‚Äúmy rights‚Äù people idea rights mean. Nowhere bill rights constitution give ‚Äúright spread disease‚Äù said ago cancel Olympics disaster necessarily. sizable amount infections asymptomatic. Also best athletes world many cases likely bodies operating peak performance. Regardless COVID, risk sickness almost every facet life. data pretty clear virus dangerous specific age groups risk factors. Can, way heart attack can. doesn‚Äôt make likely. it‚Äôs clear everyone wear mask, stores kick people don‚Äôt wear one. Idk live, mask mandate town, people followed indoors stores enforced it. Yes, yes, yes! Vaccines great! Everyone get vaccinated!  article: ""The report also reflected decreasing potency vaccination, 
 showing mere 16 percent effectiveness transmission among  
those vaccinated January, compared 44 percent vaccinated  
in February, 67 percent received shots March,  
75 percent vaccinated April."" trying say vaccine booster shot needed transmit variant, cause that‚Äôs false information, post links day , gotta logic behind Weird think know CDC. Go hide basement afraid. Nobody stopping you.

Where sources? special kind stupid confused this. Influenza family viruses ""unique"" unstable genome often known mutate, mingle strains Influenza take new genes cousin species.

For instance, 2009 Swine Flu came pigs infected pig flu human capable flu virus mingled birds infected bird flu viruses swapped genes form new strain could easily infect humans. Luckily strain serious regular flu strains already circulation among humans.

However, something similar happened 1918, 5% human population killed ensuing pandemic... Granted, lack modern medication technology help.

&amp;#x200B;

Coronaviruses generally stable, since occur many mammal species, particularly bats, know of, still potential new genes picked person animal coinfected Covid-19, similar enough animal coronavirus.

&amp;#x200B;

That's one theory Coronavirus popped actually, wild domesticated animal/ livestock infected one coronaviruses came contact another species similar enough coronavirus, came contact human one 4 ""common cold"" causing species coronavirus, swapped genes reassorted entirely new hybrid one prepared for. basically vaccines worthless. Wow. Interesting  think kids get vaccinated (hopefully they‚Äôll mandated), masks required. don‚Äôt think anywhere else discredit vaccine increase hesitancy. It‚Äôs time start requiring vaccine passports showing vaccination cards. Punish anti vaxxers. Keep peace. Warfare solves nothing. fucking crazy me. would anyone risk essentially something they've working whole lives avoid vaccine?

Like, get damn shot.

I'm sure bunch athletes going end regretting decision vaccinate.  didn‚Äôt I‚Äôm sure lot teams country would cut good bit know formula tweaked alpha-targeted version? A/B testing showed orphan performed 23% better! live NSW, outside Sydney life completely normal, restrictions, year.

6 weeks ago, slight restrictions brought non-sydney NSW: wearing mask indoors public 5 mates time. also first time, entire pandemic, I've wear mask.

Sydney heavier restrictions, suburbs even more. state New South Wales far capital city.

By end year we'll enough Pfizer jab everyone life return normal. Unfortunately plan use AZ produced Australia fell due blood clots zero covid cases community; small risk dying blood clots higher small risk dying covid age groups Australia.

I'd much rather year normal life + months minor restrictions suffering Europe America course pandemic. ""imagine many lives could've saved remained locked down""  4k deaths per day corresponding worst case prediction 240k cases per day, 60k prediction. yeah, seems like they're accounting lowered death rate Pro-vaxxers kinds people now, anti-vaxxers. see something, think know it, really don't. I'm neither point. Every government pushed hard imo. country like stasi propaganda, new research showing effectiveness nothing like predicted virus still making vaccinated people sick. Keep distance, wash hands use mask around lots people bad idea matter what. Cancel eating events possible. life valuable consumerism they'll cancel Tokyo Olympics point kick lot players  84 % new cases Delta Germany now, too. Still rising number. Soon variants practically gone.  know read data, need Delta contagious herd immunity threshold likely impossible hit now. hope stops masks. I'll wear want things shutting again. actually starting feel optimistic. sure feel phrase ‚Äúthe vaccine isn‚Äôt killing anyone‚Äù. Obviously caused death people due rare side effects, mean can‚Äôt say hasn‚Äôt. course it‚Äôs saved more, incomparable amount. kind get point. don‚Äôt like things presented fact, aren‚Äôt true. disingenuous facts lead mistrust. 
Also, highest death count (148) since March. Florida looking good right now.  understand, but... Major stores like Walmart, Costco, etc. afford security guard, regular employee outside. could shopping malls. minimum wage worker it. choose to. ""controlling better"" us fail achieve zero covid end endemic disease anyway? enough immunity stop spread, control measures flatten curve. put control measures in, flatten curve, unless we're buying time get people vaccinated, stretching number cases longer period time. 

If enough immunity stop spread now, control measures get us closer stopping spread. need lot people immunity - happens lot vaccinations lot infections. vaccines available large majority population months, third eligible people bothered go get first shot. control measures need justified - whether they're needed preserve hospital capacity, flattening curve coupled concrete plan using time substantially increase vaccination levels. Otherwise we're prolonging inevitable gaining nothing. perceived oppression.

Not actually oppression, people wanting outraged anything reminds things may hunky dory right now. That's true, Pepsi's got 2 extra grams sugar Coke, things equal see Pepsi folks dying little bit extra weight.

They're also Pepsi drinkers, less live probably hurts well.  cant get vax. Adult. Yeah, expectations unreasonably high hindsight. Jon Rahm DQ'd PGA tour event leading thru 54 holes. They've fairly strict it. hope Olympics testing every day afraid DQ athletes come positive restrictions re-enacted, unvaccinated showing hospital morgue. cases go one gets sick enough hospitalized, find way this. brief pro-vaccine statement nothing CYA plausible deniability purposes. He's still trying get people killed. Antibodies always drop memory b cells lie dormant ready spring back start spewing out.

When infected body produces trillions antibodies hour. gonna time. Thank follow up! say argument simply incorrect. 

Besides, referring guy stating ‚Äúguess dudes, show proof vaccination go office well‚Äù bad argument. 

I think everyone get vaccine, outright dismissing concerns isn‚Äôt going help convince people. Poland. looking pass supplies countries get used expire nowhere near fully vaccinated... narrow minded american view corona im sick seeing shit reddit  guess sometime fall isn‚Äôt ‚Äúremotely soon‚Äù you‚Ä¶ Yeah... fun right now. get changed. everyone fooled, chill 2 hour flight. Well mean least send well wishes people say ""That's problem south"" seem forget traveling thing. Especially country. early months pandemic, every days article citing ""data"" Israel making kind fantastical claim Covid would pop news feeds, virtually turned completely false. ones ended patently false ended half truths, misinterpretations, outright fear mongering click bait. see one additional public health organizations verify Israeli numbers, I'm even taking grain salt...I'm simply ignoring them.  becoming pretty clear Delta spreading easily vaccinated people. They're getting cold like symptoms instead full blown COVID. Pretty sure virulent thing we're going within next couple months unless literally hide rock. 98% protection numbers throwing around long pretty misleading. Get correct logic here. want intelligent analysis disrupting idiotic beliefs. know right. would nice someone invented vaccine something. Crazy one thought yet. good news. Vaccines work, I'm hopeful countries vaccines approach last year, matter much sensational headlines largely unvaxxed cases discuss it. Athletes smarter average person athlete. Yeah, it‚Äôs insane people glare (not much month ago) mask, meanwhile guy mask chin gets social stigma whatsoever. guess science shows poorly worn mask soooo much effective mask. think depends person. 

I Pfizer shots second one slightly worse first shot could feel body *something* (I want call immunological response expert this) hours second shot. next day back normal smoker leads sedentary lifestyle... Thanks. try this. Also pediatrician concerned hes talking yet. said sometimes delay speech, obviously Covid protection important. shit show state (Florida). UK definitely confirm. Look upthread see Israeli data screwy. Janssen vaccine probably saved lungs. week since serious breathing issues go go biking already. dunno. Here‚Äôs newer meta analysis looked randomized control trials commenters said likely, think ‚Äúpossibly‚Äù may appropriate answer. 

I Pfizer. Didn‚Äôt get sick. 20 friends got Pfizer, one got bit sick. described fatigue worked day, crashed bit early night (day shot). 

My wife got moderna. folks know got (another 20 people), none side effects. heard folks get side effects Moderna, didn‚Äôt see social circles. 

I know got J&amp;J well, don‚Äôt think got side effects. 

I know one person got really sick next night bounced back, I‚Äôm sure shot got. That‚Äôs like one fifty though. person gotten COVID previously, might severe reaction. sure. [Don‚Äôt worry Israel yet  August 19th 30 day appointment/phone call

I pretty intense muscle joint pain second injection minimum expecting that, wasn‚Äôt bad. bone tired, wiped. odd headache first two, minor muscle aches, balloon head feeling. grateful pain. Remember though I‚Äôm year would imagine antibodies low extreme side effects vaccine series due accumulative effect. 

This Pfizer‚Äôs trial.  Praying waste time.

It worked gun violence, childhood cancer world hunger...why would work covid? holidays kind suck. still feel like April May reasonable. think you‚Äôre missing insignificant number people don‚Äôt *die* quality lives changed infection. Either lung scarring, vessel/clotting issues, ‚Äúlong Covid‚Äù Great news, backdoor mandate new variant gold standard coronavirus.  yeah joke. Olympic village sexually active place Earth. say comfort home doubt you‚Äôd telling doctors put vent ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want live long term impacts - let die‚Äù

Everything else said noise made asinine comment I'd cautious though trying create headlines intended sway people one way another. Headlines news-driven, agenda-driven. 
It's hard situation -- news something 'surprising' 'unknown.' fact cases vaccinated indeed surprising unknown fact. 
If space headline, also indicate cases mild; otherwise, I'd bump info sooner first paragraph article.   I've seen one, maybe two posts vaccinated person losing sense smell threads, many people getting breakthrough infections. clearly rare, people believed. 5 percent lot. Pray   onto casedemic phase post vaccine covid saga Israeli data says immunity seems decline
significantly 4-5 months elapsed post vaccination. example, people vaccinated January, Israel estimated vaccine provided 16% effectiveness infected (though still 80+% effective severe infection) June 20 July 17. 

The British study appears evaluated tests related symptomatic infection within 18 weeks vaccination, far tell break amount time vaccination onset symptoms vaccination status.

So time vaccination seems important factor results, probably accounts entire reason data different. ""So long""? 

Pfizer submitted application July. Normal review takes 10 months. got priority review 6 months. FDA said move faster even expedited time frame. too. get caught trouble? data. Go look it. percent positive cases vaccinated nearly identical percent age cohort vaccinated. infection Pfizer completely failed. 

Which I'm saying data completely useless, since Israeli government claiming vaccine 40 65% efficacy asymptomatic infection. either release data they're talking bollocks. Plus, whole green pass policy would make sense all. that's even considering much outlier data compared literally every place world first place.

Your absolute risk **symptomatic** disease decreased, likelihood infected. comment day someone said surprised quickly people dropped mask. Vast majority people like wearing masks constant reminder normal situation was. don‚Äôt feel comfortable hugging giving someone handshake masked. I‚Äôm fairly liberal area 95% people unmasked given time. people vaccinated absolutely want go back wearing mask it‚Äôs perceived protect unvaccinated. it‚Äôs incredible unpopular politically even think revising CDC guidance. would psychologically demoralizing. point think people agree sides political spectrum risk needs assessed individuals themselves.  really know anything either philosophers sure I'd glad learn them.

I'm speaking admittedly anecdotal experience worked around scientists every day last 7 years life. view science brought probably thing could agree on. Everything else absolutely open questioning. said elsewhere got downvoted.

I'm (like others, feelings unique) disgusted angry government every level American people. time let people make decisions come gone. ability slow thing make less deadly people deliberately choosing to, making world dangerous uncertain everyone else busted ass follow CDC guidelines, wear masks, get vaccinated eligible. feel like I'm living Twilight Zone world. can't go back work choosing get vaccinated. continue working home struggle every day isolation comes that. live ongoing anxiety future world country simply REFUSE get vaccinated.

Get FDA approval. Start mandating vaccine everywhere can. Make people show vaccine cards (or strict justification exemption) want get manicure haircut go restaurant travel. generally want lots government regulations. understand slippery slope need protect personal freedom choice. beyond absurd point.

I'm sorry, there's nothing post that's new useful. burnt out, exhausted chronic anxiety, tired right things still suffering others' decisions. I'm getting married 2 weeks, everyone (with rare exceptions) attending vaccinated, spending year trying plan wedding pandemic, seeing drastic improvements, possibly regressing purely deliberate ignorance stubbornness beyond frustrating.

Honestly type anti-scientific comments banned. really need deal culture accepting embracing ignorance. hospitals full 2 months ago? dare you. keeps insisting he's dog sheep over. Seems perfectly reasonable. Right? got two Moderna shots back April. Everyone know got Pfizer. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è lil ol me. Typically 21 country, sometimes make one day less. know supposed less 20, seem follow that. first dose Sunday, guess want pay people overtime Sunday something, scheduled second doses Saturday.  shared story different thread applies too. Vaccinated laws (Moderna) visited us plane day returning 
 home got sick. got positive tests 4th day misery. It‚Äôs ‚Äúmild‚Äù symptoms currently are

-	Headache 
-	severe congestion (they state using double dosing NyQuil doesn‚Äôt help congestion. Ugh course warned Tylenol shouldn‚Äôt used recommended dosage)
-	fever
-	total loss taste smell

I mean neither hospitalized it‚Äôs mild FAR damn don‚Äôt want get symptoms avoid it. haven‚Äôt seen sick since met sucks loss taste smell still symptom breakthrough infections. 

(I‚Äôm Pfizer vaccinated 4-5 days exposure still testing negative asymptomatic. Get vaccines!) Depends province got first dose, people actually wait full 4 months. Ontario instance turned 4-6 weeks shots, even initially booked 4 months. 

There people still waiting, need to. Health officials trying reach people rebook ASAP mass vaccination clinics preparing close. news year half ago. must missed it. 

Western media merely started churning stories clickbait cash apparent sinophobia. Hot Take - fast spreads, going burn US population months. We'll see sharp spike cases, GREATLY suppressed death/hospitalization rate high vaccinated areas. 

The virus quickly burn vulnerable people cases drop fall. Unvaccinated people hit hardest vaccinated left fun Halloween! Agreed less 4,000/day non-sense. Medical professionals battling pandemic well year, seems good idea point hospital treatments help preventing death.   Xinhua News Agency New China News Agency official state-run press agency People's Republic China. 

I also get French news site said one ever.  many scientists brilliant understanding disease, abysmal understanding human behavior. US UK basically back normal think matter months rest developed world follows suit, regardless numbers go. dog known trouble maker. know already knew. Science works ‚Ä¶ vaccines work.  No.

One vaccines 3 weeks, 4, right? long since think that. 

Whatever recommended fine. hate clickbait, headline bullshit.

Yup. programed them, de-program them. Sadly take way statement undo 6 months disingenuous statements actions. might also help took merchandise off-line.

Someone said me.

Le sigh athlete tests positive, allowed compete. unable compete, lost chance something worked entire lives for. doesn‚Äôt death sentence ruin opportunity. Death potential consequence COVID. understand hard pill swallow, unfortunately recognize that.   someone explain efficacy rate mean ? Im slow. referring misinformation published data sets. reddit hive mind room discussions. following established narrative crack hard opponents means necessary. current ""truth"" Israeli data bogus. We'll see. work restaurant city experiencing surge (we moved Stage 3 Stage 4, includes recommendation everyone mask indoors)

The minimum would like see restaurant require employees wear mask, excuse willing show proof vaccination. is, unvaxxed employees supposed wear mask since employer said honor system. lol, except nearly 600k people US alone *was* death sentence. know someone family member ""I know going screw body side effects, put anything belong "" Mentality person . Why? gave away bunch vaccines plenty. Irrelevant article. They‚Äôre counting deaths early year delta wasn‚Äôt factor ""While antibody levels important protection, immune system defences built infection vaccination. normal antibody levels wane time immune system ‚Äúremember‚Äù infection memory B cells. virus invade, cells rapidly churn antibodies targeted virus. protection comes cells, destroy infected cells limit severity disease.""

People really saying anything different article saying too. 

This mostly article prepared case boosters needed, saying sure need boosters. debate scientific circles, like debate reddit. 

""Interim advice Joint Committee Vaccination Immunisation (JCVI) last month encouraged NHS prepare autumn booster programme, final decision whether proceed made. unclear whether protection vaccines weakened enough warrant boosters many experts argue doses needed urgently countries.""

Australia‚Äôs policy zero covid sustainable. Covid going nowhere, need change long term plan mean unless mask mandates come back. work theater asked bosses back. Basically told unless September looks like November 2020 we're producing full capacity personally think vaccinated allowed...  doctor told come back 3 weeks got second shot. 

I didn‚Äôt get side effects sore arm extreme fatigue week, downsides experience got soon? true senses, actually... Yes, everyone old smartphone get electronic pass. yellow vaccination passport works EU wide, too. 

I also think make Covid vaccination mandatory. saying visiting entertainment places need vaccinated current negative test would help lot. yes make tests cost something, would help even more. J&amp;J currently good Delta, chance best. wouldn‚Äôt worry. would rather Covid recover get lasting immunity young people getting neurological disorder. ‚ÄúWe need kids breathe,‚Äù DeSantis said, ‚ÄúAt end day, gotta start putting kids first. really comfortable, really healthy muzzled?""

Is mask less comfortable *fucking dead*? easier breathe they‚Äôre corpse? oh right get you, bad. Also got day you. feel bit fatigue headache, I'm fine. unfortunate reason think wind mask mandates again, requiring everyone wear way get unvaccinated people wear them. Otherwise, everyone knows, lie. doesn‚Äôt need cards could basically Israel done apps QR codes $$$$$$$$$ first two links study. Please read things posting. Also, people vaccinated can‚Äôt speculated assumed would vaccinated individuals asymptomatic mild disease. I'm sure know much blood concentration antibodies impacts resistance yet. correct.

Everything premised symptomatic disease, hope would provide protection infection well (which indeed do, protection wanes first). Yes, based science. Masks curb spread. first, give AZ anyone certain age (40 think) blood clot risk younger age groups. local vaccination centre available.

Good question percentage, heard anything that, ordered 100m perhaps numbers similar (but older people AZ younger Pfizer). Moderna Janssen also use never hear much recall seeing available vaccination centre. it‚Äôs NATO alphabet works.  much vaccinated point. 

Children need remain masked distanced get shots. masking vaccinated people without also putting strict distancing restrictions really effect one way another. 

The best recommend segregating vaxxed unvaxxed, unvaxxed want roll dice, choice (and/or funeral). think deputize ever grocery store worker restaurant host check vax cards? strike workable solution. Pfizer provided vaccines every single athlete team surrounding unless country and/or athlete declined everybody could vaccinated now. 4 million deaths excess deaths suggest, that's perhaps billion infections already (given young population lower IFR). running people infect. response incorrect. explained another comment, copying visibility.

‚Äê‚Äê----
 included 3 links explain vaccine efficacy means end comment.

 definition case symptomatic infection, vaccine efficacy symptomatic infection given follow-up period (1- relative risk). get relative risk first get risk group divide ((# cases vaccinated group / # people vaccinated group)/(# cases unvaccinated group/# people unvaccinated group)).

So 6 month follow 5 10,000 people vaccinated group symptomatic infection 100 10,000 unvaccinated group symptomatic infection, vaccine efficacy (1-((5/10,000)/(100/10,000)) = 95%. would get answer even total number people group went million, number cases stayed same. 

So incorrect say vaccine efficacy 95% 6 month follow-up, 10,000 people, 5% symptomatic infection.

 CDC explains ""Vaccine efficacy/effectiveness interpreted proportionate reduction disease among vaccinated group. 90% indicates 90% reduction disease occurrence among vaccinated group, 90% reduction number cases would expect vaccinated.""


Also, idea many people exposed virus group long exposure lasted. assumed randomized controlled trial, people group experience similar Canada kinda done this, older population spaced shots due supply getting everyone first dose, supply massively increased 40 demos closer month, 2 tops vaccinated, sitting hangar wearing mask one else around does, it‚Äôs mandated can‚Äôt afford get COVID-19, even asymptomatic, two reasons:

-	In 2 weeks I‚Äôll engage activity requires COVID-19

Side-effect: others around protected too.

I trust vaccines took (doubled I‚Äôm high risk area) protect hospitalization serious illness, maybe long-term COVID-19. Wearing N95 mask around others reduces probability catching it.

I don‚Äôt understand people make big deal wearing mask. I‚Äôll take little inconvenience illness others. Mask mandate makes sense wear one high risk areas.

People whining masks, vaccinated otherwise, strike immature. honestly would like understand big deal it, rebel hard.

Thoughts? I'd say it'll go COVID-21 came resisted vaccine spent another year waiting new vaccine, dying. Yes! There‚Äôs bit that. getting funny looks hangar California weeks ago, prompted make FB post group peeps would see, copy vaccination card March, text explaining two bullets original comment posted here.

That stopped dirty looks, yeah ‚Äî made great point. Cheers! would consider someone position ineligible vaccine that's important people eligible get vaccinated; protect can't. Nah, perfect 5/7 Dumb lockdowns ineffective. Look AUS etc. basically locking get zero. never happen. issue supply recall correctly. host city already realize there's never much financial benefit host cities first place. keep wearing masks despite fully vaxxed strong immune system. even caught cold since 14, let alone flu.

Well, study published Lancet found twice risk hospitalization [It's Israel wish studies made timeline perspective well. example, us vaccinated 2 doses since last January.

It's difficult generate, UK came said 200 symptoms associated. 

But tracking going worldwide, following people 3, 6, 12 months after, that's data need tackle this.

On good news front, doctor Cali come potential cause cure sufferers, [involving Make tests cost money require 3G everything that‚Äòs fun, we‚Äòll see 75% pop vaccinated within 2 months UK starting look like peaking.

Again, knocking you, sitting thinking. Hmmm? always stupidest people world?

‚ÄúBut someone gets virus mutates mutation stopped vaccines super mega ultra variant kills like‚Ä¶ 2 3% infected?! what?!?‚Äù 

Then vast majority still recover issues. 5 Delta hit Idk logical one regardless health COVID kill honestly? hope get COVID learn fucking lesson guys might running 100m. need breathe that. likely both. We'll vaccinated still catch different covid varients Looks like may actually better - Healthy people won‚Äôt need boosters yet. There‚Äôs waning antibodies - leading symptomatic infections (to expected), continue mild mainly due b cells. Delta also reduced neutralization vs og. likely ever ""done"".  

I guess point get point ""acceptable losses"". Issued first injection. Yes, CDC advice applies variant well. vaccines highly effective know variants. vaccinated - need wear mask. CDC says disagree CDC silly. hell gamma variant? first time hear this

edit: comments gave answer, thanks, old variant   really feels like back square one. Someone please tell improve 2-3 months. 2 months normalcy. Vaccines aren‚Äôt going stop current wave say someone vaccinated. husband currently moderate case covid(flu like symptoms, loss smell), healthy 29 year old fully vaccinated. can‚Äôt take anymore. possible Put know (vaccine) know (my arm) got traditional flu shot twice. important tool risk populations challenging correctly target solid performance.

If we're able use mRNA tech flu they're currently trying to, may well change.

Plus living time history prompt re-thinking lot assumptions. doesn't, died nothing. CDC say wear mask flu flu season I‚Äôm unvaccinated? No. would tell wear mask Covid I‚Äôm vaccinated flu bigger threat now?

The reason people want mask mandates put social pressure onto unvaccinated wear masks again.

Sure thing. lol  Yes Alaska one city Alaska. Both. put long Delta variant hit US. It‚Äôs thing, same. Natural antibodies protect single strain infected you. jack shit variants. Get shot, bub.

And yes, get flu shot every season protect others passed 3rd grade biology. don‚Äôt know saying J&amp;J vaccine works Delta variant true statement. experience mine shows much joke COVID testing easy forge.

I‚Äôm holiday flying back UK today needed online COVID test doctor able fly home (it ridiculously expensive service). problem was, test kit provided, tube liquid used testing crack insufficient liquid complete test.

My first idea resolve issue get new test kit local pharmacy. But, company would let use test kit one of. So, choice either fake test miss flight home. chose former option turned scarily easy do.

I filled test tube water carried test normal doctor online. completed test instructed take picture result write details (like date sort code) test strip email them. I‚Äôd obviously poured mix water stuff nostrils onto test strip, test strip blank 15 minutes. So, simply took photograph drew red line using photoshop emailed got away falsifying test avoid missing flight.

To clear conscience make sure didn‚Äôt COVID, test using kit local pharmacy (which wasn‚Äôt allowed use provide evidence company presumably test strip doesn‚Äôt QR code on). tested negative thankfully. Nothing like missing chance Olympic medal refused get vaccine. totally hear you. right, fairness people refuse get vaccinated pay care. Remember aftermath 9/11. extra measures put place, become permanent. introduce accountability health care, know far go, might result undesirable long-term consequences. initial argument. original variant delta ? Sure, symptomatic infection seems like sucks pretty hard, want go that. mention permanent health issues cause. Good hear! whole family fully vaccinated we've basically gone back normal life. know careful Delta I'll honest, we're done damn pandemic. Right.... that's what's important positive PCR test. This, even regards highly infectious viruses, Delta incredibly infectious.

The rate transmission measured R0 number, number people one person virus infect average.

The original Covid-19 Wuhan early days pandemic R0 around 2.7, double seasonal flu R0 1.3

The 1918 Spanish Flu estimated R0 2.0 3.0, line original variants Covid-19.

The 2009 H1N1 Swine Flu, R0 around 1.9

[The Delta Variant that's spreading right estimated R0 put perspective, that's around level transmissibility Smallpox way back 1970s earlier still ravaging earth unchecked

There course infectious diseases higher R0 there, like Polio 10-12, Measles 12-18, effective vaccines decades generally easily preventable/ treatable developed countries

Edit: Source are¬†fully vaccinated, resume activities pandemic without wearing mask** physically distancing, except required laws, rules, regulations, local CDCs advice selfish. Betteridge's rule headlines. asks question, answer no. That‚Äôs ironic part.  Top gov‚Äôt officials touting scientists working vaccine, turned around went science.  Mind boggling. He's right. saying things true screaming them. vaccines development alpha type tested on. Since then, lot ""funny phrasing"" level actual protection used. First protected infection. symptomatic infection. severe infection. 

We also clearly need boosters. US government low key gobbled another 200 million day. think one needs google UK situation.

Your information date. **UK deaths 1,200% since June 1.** Oh? 

From PRES. BIDEN: ""You're gonna get COVID vaccinations.""   thing keep using **misleading** numbers. example, Texas, 99.5% people died COVID February July 14 vaccinated

&amp;#x200B;

Given takes 5-6 weeks become fully vaccinated....

and 5 weeks infection dying official recording cause death....

For someone fully vaccinated dead early February, would get first dose vaccinations approved. Like, Halloween. Oh, totally understand speculating.

Doesn't mean terrible made excuse get vaxed.

Also, think I'm anecdote. I'm literally high level sports field lmao. actually texted couple athlete friends agree complete bogus.

We're talking blood drive here, vaccine training inconvenience day. think much likely accurate take ""the vaccines, work good more."" vaccinated highest risk, oldest people first, regardless week, month year, people likely see breakthrough infections due overall health status.  regular worker, someone vaccination clinic! Thanks anecdote! mean, guess that's normal flu certain respects? get sick, everything tastes like garbage/you appetite, goes away start feeling better. extended version scares me, feel totally better, buds messed up. problem overwhelm system again. health care staff fried. Nurses leaving droves. surgeries pushed back. Cancer patients wait longer treatment. creates stress health care service providers. everybody outlook shit, guy overly optimistic. need least 50%+ even get approved iirc.  got updated numbers VA's fancy dancy dashboard includes vaccinated breakdown (other states take note)

For week July 12th - 18th:

29 break cases, 1.04% total cases.

The case rate per 100k 7 day rolling avg 4.68. 0.04 breakthrough cases.

Original SARS much easier spread symptomatic high fatality rate people would put much tighter restrictions. wonder contributing factor breakthrough infections likely people immunocompromised, conditions make vaccine less likely effective. people are, course, significantly increased risk death infected. personally young kids family living life pretty much normally don‚Äôt think much reason worry judge. haven‚Äôt seen children wearing masks city either one dying. data 'unlocking' would great news country still control measures - expected trend continue.

Another 10 days needed see whether trend truly decreasing, per BBC article, R number increased 1.2 1.4 - good sign future infection numbers. death rate age range likely multiples higher without vaccination. wife‚Äôs boss refers office campus Olympic Village :(  line thinking point stop holding people accountable choice make ? smoke, drink alcohol, live city, eat fast food candy, exercise ?

You end one other. found doctor vaccinated, would never go again. quote it. incorrect information present? I‚Äôm curious specifically found embarrassing statement. No, anytime there's article antibody levels, people keep saying basically matter. quite common here. article say matter. 

Yet, experts mulling idea boosters basis antibody levels (not B cells). Health experts think antibody levels matter. commenter never said people hypothetically covid even tested positive. vaccinated; showing symptoms; going allowed play. ... overly abused exemptions measles vaccine mandates reconsidered

We're going treat covid vaccination similarly, even ends needing yearly.

Until we're things like new parents deciding grandparents allowed visit newborn grandchildren happened families last year may remain thing. Isnt Japan one least vaccinated '1st world' coubtries? feel like people missing concerning part. Even vaccinated people barely affected show symptoms, virus mutate further.

A variant originated vaccinated person may likely infect vaccinated people, time they‚Äôll actually symptoms. confirm, we're mocking fucking twat.

If there's anything else want look you, let know. Apocalympics 2, electric boogaloo inc. :)

You survive car crash, doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôll afterwards.

Not mention chances mutation come new infection. vaccines work well‚Ä¶ now. longer thing spreads among unvaccinated circles, threaten us mega variant. Imagine spending entire life training olympics lose chance compete get sick vaccine available. Japanese need get shit together vaccinate stop complaining. It‚Äôs like sitting around watching small flame billow camp site standing next fire extinguisher. Get vaccine could pretty normal olympics. Wtf. too. got it, recovered, issues. Positive antibody tests fact. don‚Äôt know everyone pretending natural immunity isn‚Äôt thing. also get flu shots years past purely protect others? There's lot went certain politician getting almost cult like following, lockdowns opposite side really forced lot people extremes.

Yeah, hear sure - even Canada person helped fuel lot crazy. Stay safe! speaking US Yup. Everyone gathers reeeaaaal close already hyper congested part Japan (which like double whammy Japan super congested anyway), lives close together thing eeeeverybody travels back home countries bring back whatever variant makes rounds there.

I'm really hoping bad I'm grimacing writing soooo...

Pfizer literally gave bunch could vaccinate athletes gotten it, yet. knew countries lower &amp; whatever issues &amp; covered guess even matter. Yes, people seem done better upon reinfection probably reduced chance (but elimination) infecting others. that's still different thing immunity, I'd take actual challenge study petri dish study infection.

This matter things like attempting reach herd immunity. There's difference immunity reinfections year, even reduced shedding reinfections.  Same, got Pfizer. accounts Astra Zenica seems worse side effects. According Wife least. feds told safe stop wearing mask vaccinated. am. Go take problem.

AP ASSESSMENT: False. documented cases viruses becoming deadly.

THE FACTS: spread coronavirus variants raise new public health questions, social media users sharing misinformation viruses mutate.

A post Facebook reads, ‚ÄúIn history virology, never, EVER, viral mutation resulted virus lethal. viruses mutate, become contagious/transmissible LESS lethal.‚Äù

But fact, cases viruses mutated become deadly.

‚ÄúThat claim whole nonsense,‚Äù said Troy Day, professor mathematics biology Queen‚Äôs University Canada, studied ways infectious diseases, including coronavirus, evolve.

Some examples viruses became deadly time include developed drug resistant variants, animal viruses bird flu, harmless humans initially mutated become capable killing people, according Dr. Amesh Adalja, senior scholar Johns Hopkins University‚Äôs Center Health Security.

‚ÄúFlu viruses developed resistance certain antivirals make difficult treat, therefore make deadly,‚Äù Adalja said, also noting happened HIV certain Hepatitis C strains.

Viruses constantly mutate copy themselves. mutations may make meaningful changes, others give virus new characteristics. early scientific theories suggested viruses evolved, would become contagious less lethal keep spreading, time scientific community acknowledged that‚Äôs always case. never knew reading sub antibodies utterly worthless public health experts fret antibody levels trying scare ignorant people know secrets B cells.

Zero COVID fantasy never happen country, let alone world. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Clearly unvaccinated athletes die, fitness gods 20s at-risk group Yeah, it'll still spread faster among unvaccinated, one piece data suggests vaccine stop spread. 

The HMS Queen Elizabeth 100 breakthrough infections, operating 100% vaccinate crew. would expected little zero transmission kind environment, still spread among vaccinated too, clearly.  exactly thinking is, vaccine mean? Since pandemic unvaccinated, less viable hosts covid spread too. Eventually form herd immunity, add vaccinated natural infections, herd immunity inevitable. should, rights, last surge. call this, natural selection Good luck that.  So, making stuff up, cool.    got first dose(Pfizer) 


I‚Äôm scared shots/needles fan like sane people, WTF painless injection I‚Äôve had, good. Felt like needle smaller well, forever since I‚Äôve shot kind remember actually feeling go farther(unless injector wrong lol ü§∑üèª ‚ôÇ  


2nd dose appointment 8/13‚Ä¶..Friday 13th üò≥ get sick, get sick. virus wreaks havoc bodies ends athletic career, that's them. three-year-old toddler wife fully vaccinated wear masks wherever go. take precautions keep important us safe. people take precautions keep safe, that's them. Yes, know potentially infect people. again, that's them. worry letting vaccinated students workers country even though Japanese tourists already go random countries. Absolutely farcical studies vaccine efficacy deaths (especially Delta) shows 99%+? seen one. I've seen pretty worthless misleading breakthrough numbers actually show efficacy. going create new fun variants, bring home. Okay, doesn‚Äôt really address question posed, I‚Äôll ask different one. percentage children suffer long term adverse affects then? sub: ""follow science wear masks.""

Also sub: ""I looked science/I trust *you* keep wearing mask regardless."" 

I understand antimaskers/antivaxxers might tune stop listening. Maybe actually practice preach instead passing moral judgements others would inclined listen. study called question global health authorities findings contradictory similar studies internationally *and* released raw data analyzed. 

Until release data, there's way determine whether credible. Wait Asian American?!?!?!? think taken little bit caution. UK ""basically back normal"" 1 week, US looking like backtrack decision soon.

And ""basically back normal"" ""pre-covid normal"" still long way go. ready allow people mild-covid symptoms board full plane masks? lot aspect ""pre-covid normal"" seem utopia current time. stat holds alpha version virus. variants. vaccine effective those. stats OP article revealing deeper issue. vaccinated people still getting infected transmitting virus faster rate unvaccinated unvaccinated able fight new variant better unvaccinated cautious. also live DC. Go gym, packed unmasked, everyone probably vaccinated. Even Whole Foods half masked. People go lives understand risk way better compared here/Twitter. completely understand work. correct I'm wrong, prior vaccines coming out, seeing 15% covid cases result serious illness? would mean 85% covid cases pre-vax serious. 91% covid cases post vax serious, that's decrease, 99% seeing back May. doubtful people healthy enough Olympians would ventilator regular case covid would still much disruptive shots. He's saying we've already reached ""October peak"" scenario number cases. suggesting fully vaxxed people serious danger incorrect antivaxx

Except never said this, anything even similar.

I‚Äôm fact, explicitly chances hospitalized dying become very, small, though.

None changes original comment (that vaccine makes chances getting spreading covid ""astronomically small"") wrong.  said CDC director‚Äôs announcement masking bad idea Delta looming horizon drowning downvotes. 

Totally agree need proactive. 

I concerned CDC‚Äôs messaging far often seems reacting public opinion. agency may good work, need overhaul comms. Yeah, I‚Äôve resigned done part looking no.1 cases start increase. 
I‚Äôll continue mask / venture out. 
When kids get shot REALLY worry past. Easily survivable too, given current data. Funny Surgeon General, NIH director many public health authorities increasing disagreement CDC that.

They're yet point breaking professional political courtesy flat saying CDC wrong, starting recommend vaxinated mask control types situations seen parts country. Coming soon workplace:

*""I tOlD vAcCiNes wOrK!!!""*  Bring boosters. I'm ready. crazy. humanity, why?  98% covid survive. 99% deaths right unvaccinated people. absolutely reason locking  "
