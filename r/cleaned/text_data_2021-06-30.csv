Well put  yeah I've joined subreddit, know I've avoided long haha Moderna Pfizer mRNA sequences different. build different ""spike protein"" structures.  Denver, lifted mandate stores....poof, like never happened. Great, guys, inconvenienced. thoughts exactly, call talking big game, baby getting lil ole shot. actually effective dealing roughneck mechanic/construction/veteran/""mans""man type. broke defensive wall fear, trusted me, able get common sense heads, able get crew vaxxed, took effort. Sure, especially vast majority first doses already given. Isn‚Äôt still data around grey matter brain tissue loss even mild cases covid? Makes sense, like knowing mean standard deviation. Anecdotally, know someone get infected close contact infected person someone everything right still got infected.  Okay explains bit. Thanks antivaxxers 1918 flu, too. formed gangs beat people wore masks. Good hear! Half family vaccinated J&amp;J including 75yo dad! Mask mandates mean much people exposing noses holding maskless gatherings like normal.  Damn! it‚Äôs cdc recommended, doctors promoting that? yeah wtf. dude tried spread misinformation. failed tried blame class, like somehow makes difference Corruption Thanks much! first time seen comment? post days.  post comment downvoted basis. Fact: ScoMo went cheapest option. Fact: trying avoid wasting surplus stock vaccine lot people (given choice) want. Fact: need get life (personal opinion). According ped, nothing. We‚Äôve told kids higher risk cold developing something serious covid data backs up. come second shot much stronger side effects they're same?

There stronger side effects one doses, random worse side effects both. [K actually interested in.

We've heard superspreaders - keep R value see it, implies many infect less average.

The stat thinking small size New Zealand outbreak, 277 separate introductions virus 649 cases remainder (57%) lead transmission event.

From study.

It obviously got infective time, still uncommon hear truly close contacts infecting other. Also that's 47% eligible, excluding &lt;12 years age. obese greatly increases chances bad situation COVID. easiest way stay safe COVID eat well exercise. dangerous take second shot without taking first shot infected covid19 all?

Not all. safe vaccinated scenario mentioned. understand right, saying infection effect took first shot

No. differences. Avoiding infection taking doses ideal. 

Both doses identical, unless getting Sputnik. would bit unfair restrict vaccinated people everyone oppurtunity get yet. class people

What terrible thing say. I‚Äôm sorry, what? spreading blatant misinformation. uncivil. asked legitimate question see medical expert openly disagreeing coronavirus going kill another 600,000? No. never going regardless. Excess deaths well normal. Harvesting effect likely.

My prediction coronavirus deaths, infectious diseases take since herd immunity coronavirus reached. Instead coronavirus cancelling flu, it‚Äôll like flu cancelling coronavirus. 

We need stop mass PCR testing however, detect viral particles months infection. imagine biden makes announcement Sunday. Straight obama playbook.

Delta variant literal bullshit. like South Africa Brazil UK variants. variants didn‚Äôt cause DOOM people predicting. Changing name make racist doesn‚Äôt change that. Watch out. comment make lose election. Okay and‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.point is‚Ä¶ Yup, mom would get friends got it. selective getting Pfizer. I‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs free all, I‚Äôm still voluntarily wearing mask I‚Äôm rush go back 500+ person gatherings, someone who‚Äôs vaccinated isn‚Äôt regular contact kids, I‚Äôm panic mode anymore. Er, sorry, kinda mess stats there. Except mildly sore arm hours neither shot (Moderna) issue me. wife, otoh, Pfizer sucked hard her.

Definitely appreciate folks got fully vaccinated despite troubles. Thanks all! Lmao five years people still harping that. even cringe. kinda cool see trying connect youth. Unless younger 12. then? lol, would anyone get mRNA vaccines 80% effective preventing COVID altogether funny many people afraid needles telling us ""shouldn't live fear"" too.  Honest question, still bad UK despite high vaccination rates there? among top world 1st doses far 2nd, yet seem far worse comparably vaccinated countries. Could attributed lower efficacy AstraZeneca compared Moderna &amp; Pfizer?

I clue social distancing policies looking like now, perhaps explanation too. Canadian, I‚Äôve living lockdowns covid, including majority last 6 months despite lower 2nd dose rate (~28%) recently surpassing 1st dose rate UK much better shape (2% UK new cases today 50% UK population). Nah  mean perfect, either.  Maybe they're effective bragging. 'inferior' vaccines pushovers everyone claims  source that? IIRC average R value experts said variants around 3. say anything distribution transmission, since possible average 3 majority infect one else. accept it. Sorry. bad night me. Sorry rude dude. reason said did. rough patch rude hard feelings me. Good point. People say though still like it.  Lol! stand corrected friend. Ontario‚Äôs ridiculous government, we‚Äôre fantastic spot. double vaxxed weeks truly impressed good turnout poor man's gold
ü•á would've known area successful/intelligent individuals would high vaccination rate.... make fun sissy coward afraid needles Sorry hear. Numerous patients I‚Äôve died it, wish way show skeptics. Thank much, helpful :) guess I'm saying number seems meaningless now. previous targets ""under 5% means control."" based vaccines. really indicate now? spread among antivaxxers handful children?

I think expect increase positivity rate since cases Missouri, I'm really sure besides confirm already know. Or, might surprise you, I‚Äôm laughing people downvoting it‚Äôs telling.

That gives explanation doesn‚Äôt contradict main point, therefore would reasonable accept it, no? anyone else feel like Biden call July 4th ‚Äúindependence Covid‚Äù party?

I feel like it‚Äôs little premature disingenuous country right now, possibility Delta variant could make situation take turn worse, fact might convince antivaxxers it‚Äôs free don‚Äôt give crap. sides see side way. one America unvaccinated die off. I've saying **months**. Public health authorities spent whole time talking acute illness, hospitalizations, death, outright dismissed spectre disabilities *millions* people. yep snacking, drinking water, etc. 


You seem meet many new people. hard remember person eyes. Theres reason people rob commit crimes masks. helps disguise them. 

You minimize inconvenience wearing masks. Everyone understands knows pretty inconvenient. Everyone knows masks great worn protect people weird addicted people minimizing inconvenience. Like bro okay honest. okay say masks good health also they're pretty inconvenient. need mutually exclusive. Although risk death reduced still get Covid, unpleasant. moreso, OP indicated kids, worry may risk. Call doctor lasts longer 4 hours. Congrats! Genetically modified Adenovirus also that‚Äîjust involves DNA instead mRNA. makes cell produce spike proteins instead full genome Please remember Pfizer showed reduction infection odds 10 days first dose. around 3 4 weeks first dose saw numbers Wyolop referenced. get 2nd shot, please remain cautious! What's Civil War anyway? overly semantic reducing transmission stopping transmission actually different. would misleading say vaccination stops transmission significantly reduces likelihood transmission. sister lives country received SinoVac vaccine, last shot end April. She‚Äôs visiting US right able opt Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine going back. safe? We‚Äôve looked internet doesn‚Äôt seem much getting vaccinated twice different vaccines.  Lol lol lol lol lol lol still interact rest world. live Atlantic Canada city 2 periods uncontrolled community transmission hundreds cases imported. government even aiming 0 cases controlled transmission we'd much better rest North America got shit together. question exactly. reports 3000% sounds like good number. 

i math.

kent variant needs 900 seconds 

delta variant needs 10 seconds

so delta 9000% transmissible? overall seven-day positivity rate state climbed 8.2%, according MDHSS. number climbed three percentage points month, number still high 23.1% last time positivity rate high Jan. 31, 2021.

It‚Äôs funny numbers show opposite claiming. November people likely get tested scenario suggest, yet percentage insanely high. 

Meanwhile positivity rate increased 3 points one month even though nothing else changed. last day public schools Missouri May 26.. ex- [Republic Schools calendar shot probably needed US EU coming months. rest world excited though. Novavax vaccine great alternative AstraZeneca vaccine. seems like millionth time, *you*. So.. end June now, sillyness Ontario things look pretty good. yeah that's definition word ""protection"" thanks clarifying. point 79% marked decrease 95%or whatever covid classic. ok call vaccinations ""shots"" ""jabs""? US allowed vernacular countries play too? Yeah think Pfizer Moderna spike. recipe illness. parts virus. Probably causing strong immune response. I‚Äôve given plenty critical thought. Vax‚Äôd Wax‚Äôd, baby! thanks summary data. sure downvoted. got vaccine wear mask whenever want. Doesn‚Äôt stop going all. Even vaccinated someone got pneumonia last year risk covid worrying pneumonia fucking sucks get virus give similar symptoms wishlist. Fuck that, wish was. needs price incredibly stupid asshole. 
Being kind caused MASSIVE amount stupidity. I'm done.
I cant stop rhen idiots glad fucking consequences it.
Fuck idiots. either? Looking forward results AZ/Moderna regime, Canadian joined team Astraderna yesterday. experience shots resulted systemic side-effects fever, chills, insomnia, headaches, sore arm, muscle aches. However first dose AZ way intense second dose Moderna. hope sarcastic, others. 

8 weeks near optimal minimum period 2nd dose AstraZeneca, takes 6-8 weeks first dose bodies immune system forget adenovirus vector. shorter efficacy takes nose dive, going slightly longer gives minimal benefit. 

Unless hermit go recommended 1st 2nd, hopefully variant tailored third point. Right, people want answer even really one yet. Heard NPR reporter saying Fauci ""refused give answer"" something other, listened interview told KNOW, kept pushing. Like, want make shit up? that's Redfield apparently lol. interpret r0? good bad representing? Even might massive underestimation.

Other studies suggested covid deaths Mexico 2-3 times higher official numbers. IHME suggests Mexico total number deaths Brazil, despite Mexico's population 40% smaller. said still feel it, even eventually show helped zero percent, regret wearing them, especially area Harvard Global Epidemic Risk tipping point months governor refused anything it. Well one won‚Äôt last long, so‚Ä¶. I‚Äôm laughing people downvoted it‚Äôs telling, I‚Äôm particularly fussed downvotes.

You also need reread wrote. think start rural Missouri. U/Hoosiergirl29 wrote best comment seen this:

Good try Lol. hospital hired 150 Filipino nurses. bargaining power. that's true nearly every ""0 covid"" country reporting cases? case failure them.  true. Several accomplished doctors institutions Washington School Medicine argued logic. 

1: you‚Äôre supposed lasting high antibody levels. natural plateue infection supposed take place. body still t-cells produce covid antibodies needs to. 

2: Every single virus thats ever studied history mankind produced lasting immunity infected. People exposed Spanish Flu 1918 tested 90!!!! years still demonstrated immunity. isnt single shred evidence longer immunity covid.

3: Variants often called ‚Äúsameiants‚Äù people Virology industry similar makes difference.

4: multiple doctors starting warn people covid get vaccine seeing higher rate bloodclots thise patients I'm one ones received J&amp;J vaccine I'm really wondering time future could get another type booster. seems less info Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine I'm little bit worried protection have. Sure, use slightly different definitions call wrong. guess that‚Äôs fair. still polio outbreaks. Right now. 2021. Vaccines don‚Äôt stop spread, the(y) mitigate symptoms.

I understand greatly reduce severity symptoms great, also **definitely** reduce contraction virus, main measure efficacy cited subreddit scientific studies. Also extension, reduction symptoms reduces virus‚Äô ability spread aren‚Äôt coughing, sneezing generally expelling many viral particles air around you.

I know reducing strain healthcare major goal reducing symptoms, reducing spread definitely HUGE goal well. virus spreads without resistance masses end sorts variants could worse original virus. Surprise surprise situation currently new *variants concern* popping across globe.

You could argue mitigating virus‚Äô ability mutate turn super strain transmits higher rate, deadlier immune current vaccines top goal handling pandemic. wore masks vaccinated I‚Äôm open research could show efficacy, survey studies ain‚Äôt it. obvious confounding variables make conclusions quite dubious. 

I wasn‚Äôt able access article I‚Äôm wrong please correct me. Wouldn‚Äôt Pfizer‚Äôs best financial interests say doesn‚Äôt work well Delta need boosters?  like you. AZ first really knocked butt side effects. Felt like really bad flu 36 hours. 2nd shot yesterday Moderna insomnia last night woke groggy low grade fever sore arm, side effects nowhere near intense AZ effects. agree completely. new territory advice change learn more.

Found Trevor Bauers account oh god covid arm tho. Really, Pfizer people get that!??! Doubtful. Moderna developed design within 48 hours complete COVID-19 genome published, I'm pretty sure Pfizer shortly after. made things rapidly knowledge company doing.

IIRC Moderna delivered first batch vaccine testing first American died, identical what's going arms now. Yes. continue social distance wear masks. Masks stop airborne transmission unless wearing N95+. Sitting crowded train surgical mask shit. Yeah, weeks majority cases 20-29 age group.

Bullshit. nations loose Quarantine procedures give much leeway. Regions strict universal conditions cover entire incubation period extremely successful. really understand took long. flu shot mandatory last couple years us aged care workers... logical reason lockdown protect NHS, suppose possible daily cases could scare Boris making political decision. 

Anyone back envelope math see due vaccines social behaviour vast majority new cases 3rd wave 15-24 age group, means daily cases could 15 times higher January peak 60k hospitalisations would doable rate. However bringing supportable 900k day rate remaining unvaccinated older groups, want reassign NHS capacity covid again, flu season around corner. daily cases hit around 350k hospitalisations around 2000 day expect brakes put back on, early see 350k even possible delta variant UK, want proved can. thought businesses supposedly crippled virus could afford picky.

Yes.

Ofcourse low due sheer size population.

India rich country. India average infrastructure. recently vaccinations bumped up. 2nd dose dates vast majority 18+ still time away. India young population

How anyone realistically expect India bump percentage fully vaccinated population level US? 

Having huge population mean corresponding magical increase supply better infrastructure. 2 companies can't make billion doses short time. 


‚ÄúPost-Covid health problems common even among people gotten sick virus all, study found. nearly half patients hospitalized Covid-19 experienced subsequent medical issues, 27 percent people mild moderate symptoms 19 percent people said asymptomatic‚Äù many showed symptoms?

Useless article Yeah liked stuff done outside Covid also. gone cleanings work.   US 10000 cases yesterday. 300 million people US. math many infected people meet.

Assuming 100k Americans currently infected COVID person meet 1/3000 chance COVID  absolutely silly, considering fact pets textured surfaces shed everywhere. They're much vector carpet (which lie on) &amp; door handles.  took exactly 12 hours side effects. awful. fever 102 12+ hours took another day come back somewhat normal completely knocked out. Like I'd actually sick, grateful actually covid. don‚Äôt know stabilizing reagent, about?

Based heard it‚Äôs due actual mRNA component. Unmodified mRNA cause major inflammatory response, whole reason modRNA developed first place.

So can‚Äôt use high dose vaccine cause serious side effects. make huge difference would think Yeah, I‚Äôm still 100% masking indoors seeing outdoor interaction published day gave serious pause. cctv part reinforcing accurate info also concerns me. There's precise way estimate individual risk breakthrough case, 5% reasonable estimate. Well come back around wait long enough interact lot people, matter time catch virus. 

? Exactly  means 5% likely infected non-vaccinated person Amen! private sector efficient arguement rediculous. Yes, private sector efficient *at generating profit* outcomes health quality life could go back Doctor ask studies citing- idea trust doctors. Whatever study quoting showed 0.4% kids ending serious case covid. We‚Äôve done everything right, isolated us, extended family friends meet fully vaccinated. probability getting covid seems pretty low considering almost activities outside we‚Äôre around vaccinated people. Isn‚Äôt idea trust science follow medical advice doctors? also main reason low efficacy fact stabilizing agent use limits dosage low levels higher ones well tolerated body? 

They tried sell advantage past (only 10ug instead 30 100 Biontech / Moderna), interviews trial results mentioned low dosage issue regard insufficient immune response... Yeah kind of, stable mRNA less degraded protein produced.

Really? Netherlands vaccinated people USA Germany. virus singular noun Latin, plural declination, doumented use plural form.

But 2 months contracted covid lot antibodies, might reason.. second wave ended lockdown. ""worst case"" basically every unvaccinated person country catching COVID - US (where still 0.6-0.8% CFR state, one youngest country). many people be, age way completely prevent deaths strict lockdown

No, way completely prevent deaths vaccination.  bought doses every manufacturer trust case one manufacturer fails, fallback plan. I‚Äôm glad this. far Pfizer Moderna delivered promised. AstraZeneca doses came mostly India paid separately( Serum Institute got permission produce AstraZeneca, they‚Äôre affiliated). EU literally suing AstraZeneca right due failure deliver doses. Novavax delayed trials, Johnson Johnson production issues well. sixth company bought Canadian locally owned firm still developing vaccine variants. physical vaccine doesn‚Äôt exist yet. practically bought promise. Okay. decide want CFR be, multiply 2000 infections last month, multiply 20,000 infections month. number 10 times bigger.

But saying CFR 0 now, living reality. ok type narrow minded ignorance what's fckinh many young people. Covid affects people differently lately Delta variant shown affect lots young people adversely. means serious illness leading long term organ damage long haul covid worse death.. young people personally know perfect health need badly affected disease.. want gamble life coz unreasonable fear vaccine ready pay ultimate price dice rolls wrong way Indeed let's take 0.3% CFR number, say worst case scenario hitting 60,000 cases/day (like 2nd wave). we're talking 180 people dying day, sad is, nothing like first two waves. Given way completely prevent deaths strict lockdown aim zero covid, unrealistic anyway, ultimately additional deaths. think goal prevent NHS overwhelmed, managing COVID like seasonal epidemic. could thing keeps recurring body can't clear completely. 

If option (I know everyone insurance/money) might want go doctor see something bacterial need antibiotics for. Well certainly seems like one side outlast other. üòê lag back December though? No. countries? India get back control fast? narrow bell curve 8k cases day 400k back 8k quickly. 

Uk trending wrong direction. 
Afghanistan bit Another day another press release great vaccine is. Shame everyone vaccinated time actually bother applying approval anywhere. believe vaccine % figures quoted ones quoted full population 14 correlate current case numbers, multi week lag, it'll go likely nothing like previous peaks.  may missing something vaccine figures full population no? checked various sources said 66.9% one vaccination UK entire population principle (other nations can't buy doses) same? buy promise manufacture doses later? think error bars large say 0.3% CFR involves grand total 9 people dying. might died previous wave. Deaths lag infection months. No, I'd rather know country 100 million state. 11 month old kitten died arms choking fluid lungs sick covid March 2020. serious heart defect much body handle :(

My cat would hunch wheezing breathing hard week two hoped every time happened lose too. able recover. matter UK does.. always variants. Even got 50k cases day, world regularly reports 500k cases daily know we're going impose restrictions possibility complete immune escape. 

The risk long COVID also lot higher older people vaccinated lot less 10 times amount. Even 10x cases theory right, we're expected peak 30k - 40k cases. reach levels hospitalisations needed overwhelm NHS, need reaching 600k daily cases. That's obviously possible even was, virus would quickly run people infect. South Africa variant...UK variant...Brazil variant...Delta variant...don't matter; result. Get vaccinated good. 50% new cases kids 19 younger generally suffer ill effect virus, except quarantine home miss school. Around 3% cases 65 older. delta virus ripping unvaccinated population, even though it‚Äôs dangerous/transmissible/increases need care, groups going high thresholds requiring hospital care impacting deaths hospitalisations significant degree. 

The people go hospital generally likely come it, sooner. number people hospital Covid sits around 1400, yet January number around 39,000, lot spare capacity available needed, although don‚Äôt think NHS morale could cope another spike level. Yeah, can't typical.

...I sorta hate them. Sorta. takes much effort fully need effort clean up.

So. diffential substantial, complaint even close valid. Ty sharing Oh, agree. That‚Äôs said trying.

Many older buildings aren‚Äôt well ventilated, oftentimes kicked road repeatedly. Providing additional funding schools help increase ventilation modernize equipment could help reduce spread Covid now, spread flu illness future. 
Getting better ventilation schools central air still heating boilers going real challenge though. No. Learn math better. got Moderna worse reaction first shot too. vomiting though, thankfully, sound unpleasant.

Bear mind get second shot officially classed ""fully vaccinated"" purposes travel, attending events, etc. Depending live future plans are, could become issue. merrier, especially safe kids. Many people (unwisely, mind) insisting children vaccinated reopen schools. They've closed almost 16 months! Yes. 

But point one allergic COVID-19 vaccine, chance low, it‚Äôs virtually inconsequential.

That said, goes back original comment thread, OP can‚Äôt get vaccinated due medical reasons

Again, keep hearing term, ‚Äúmedical reasons‚Äù individuals shouldn‚Äôt get vaccinated one seems specific.

You, however, provided suggestion people allergies I‚Äôm showing CDC recommendations already *and* chances one allergic active ingredient COVID-19 vaccine and/or allergic different vaccine less 0.001%.

So, I‚Äôm still waiting (or anyone) provide specific medical conditions prohibit people getting COVID-19 vaccine. far, one. pandemic first getting serious governor state hand mask mandate, actually less 24 hours later turned around came another statement saying may restrictive masks mandated everybody's personal choice. flip flop less one day I'd say good 60% people state take seriously single second that. Delta, indias case load currently comprises 80% delta cases That's answer exactly hoping for. mRNA vaccine? is, difference Pfizer/Moderna? are.

We've traced absolute vast majority recent cases Australia, pet human never even considered risk. also got downvoted predicted every single one four previous waves Netherlands, expected it. don‚Äôt know getting downvoted, absolutely right. dropped every restriction majority people even first shot. Nowhere close Spain. Uptake rate great.  Since UK suggests mix match presumably many got first AZ dose get mRNA second dose. Alabama barely 30% fully vaccinated, due anti-lockdown/anti-vax stronghold, it‚Äôs unfortunate it‚Äôs particularly alarming either. 

California gonna take longer reach herd immunity due fact it‚Äôs state highest population country.   Low efficacy towards delta variant general? you‚Äôre saying they‚Äôre Left Right Twix vaccines? Germany gonna bully rest EU using vaccine.

No, Germany already planing without CureVac since first trial results released. I'm really interested worthless opinion. Could contributing labor shortage well wonder? point vaccines main job keep people hospital effective it.

You know severe symptoms infected. get vaccine almost guaranteeing least die.

And know arguing anyone reading, make gamble first place? get shot. Again, im asking vaccines dangerous. Im asking, since potent compared Sinovac, would dangerous get weaker immune system? bloody idiots power decided using masks school 17th may useless.
I‚Äôm really loss words try understand boundless limits stupidity. people wear mask badly lied told masks useless, would care? countries people educated wear properly fitted FFP2 masks. always Astra Zaneca never Pfizer Moderna. Wonder why... ‚ÄúSociety terrible time preparing things remote possible occur sooner later.‚Äù

Not practical purposes relating policy what's worth actively worrying about. Right. big concern frontline worker. vaccine significantly reduces chance long Covid feel okay staying front lines. feel somewhat confident likely something much something unknown. 1. doubt it, UK companies hesitant insist medical procedures staff. Even Covid testing company many others went far recommending staff test frequently.

2. still mask mandates, gone anywhere.

5. idea this, I'm sure political strong enough another lockdown guess depends gets really bad. article model assume totally open borders 5 infected individuals day measures taken slow spread 2 year period. admit results extreme outcomes point show could happen relied vaccines alone threw open border.

People acting nice other. Hardly road rage. People opening doors other. nicer general. faced population highly skeptical coronavirus vaccines, particular Russia's homegrown jabs, independent polling showing **60% plan getting inoculated**.

Also people don‚Äôt suffer fever‚Ä¶ Exactly. understand people WANT things bad. going fine. expecting uptick cases deaths, hospitalization ICU admissions go much, all. effectively over. That's vaccines meant do.

And sorry, way people mask (cloth mask ill-fitting surgical mask, usually chin) absolutely nothing. argue day whether masks work (and agree fit tested n95s goggles could make difference transmission) fact followed, anywhere. NPI reproducible population, intervention public health fail. getting pfizer long need wait train? heard 1 week, include walking? can't bear able workout, swim jog entire week:( Well, everyone wants vaccine could one, creating hotspots problem, solution. may know, Darwin city Australia.

We're spoiled west vaccines compared rear world empIrical. haven‚Äôt enough breakthrough infections long enough study whether vaccine prevents risk long covid. considering it‚Äôs definitely possible get long covid asymptomatic cases, would assume it‚Äôs somehow impossible get vaccinated asymptomatic cases?

I feel like particular argument (that can‚Äôt prove asymptomatic vaccinated cases cause long covid) must spreading around forums devoted certain viewpoints. never seen anyone make argument week suddenly I‚Äôve seen used frequently shoot suggestion delta variant merits caution. end August, Denmark one highest uptakes world also vaccinated two effective vaccines. Denmark truly worked hard protect citizens. 

In Netherlands live, probably less done mid-August, that‚Äôs lower uptake using lot vector vaccines. Like buddy Trump. Simon Birmingham Thursday said Australia supply challenges ‚Äúbecause European countries drug companies favoured nations who‚Äôve high rates Covid delivery vaccines like Pfizer‚Äù.

An entire article written around flimsiest passing buck politician. Well done, _Guardian_! Fair enough. using past examples beta variant one South Africa mutation it? found interesting never really took hold country outside SA already highly contagious variants circulating vaccines used EU already approved EMA.

EU residents citizens far anyway. also means EU residents citizens got non EMA approved get valid one. end host countries set conditions, e.g Spain suspended sort check people comming area.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Also, wonder many parents send kids school without covid vaccination give annual flu shots, seeing flu similar even worse hospitalization mortality rates children... taking long vaccine approval kids? inexplicable enraging they've deprioritized delayed vaccine seems nearly 9-10 months. really saying don‚Äôt enough evidence, it‚Äôs least used vaccine places used haven‚Äôt really Delta hot spots (mainly US took almost initial supplies). actually perform well it‚Äôs efficacy far similar South African Brazilian variants little drop off. One threshold border control remain allow fully vaccinated travelers low-risk countries pre-departure test.

Yes key issue. That's still fully open back normal border could talking five years least. hope vaccination done we'd able fully open. already eliminated measles within NZ required 95% vaccination rates.

Actually NZ never come close achieving rates well behind US decades. US requires vaccination attend public schools. NZ never made compulsory. 

The recent data shows 88% 5-year olds fully immunised, older cohorts number much lower study placing Measles immunity people born 1980 2000 77-83%. modelling also shows 93%+ vaccinated achieve herd immunity Pfizer vaccine.

And never come within 10% number whole population vaccine. recent poll found 77% adults eligible Covid vaccine would take it. adults take hesitant giving kids, make 15% population. 

Also study Te Punaha Matatini found need 97% coverage achieve herd immunity. see article study worst part R0 7 percentage population needing vaccinated achieve herd immunity unachievable without vaccinating children.

Not necessarily, children develop natural immunity too. di mean pretty ill? Severe covid joke, talking like cold, talking barely walk restroom without breath collapsing? wish speedy recovery. forner hes mostly it, vaccine still job. 14 deaths per day 80M country?

US 100 people per day dying flu Stop worrying delta. shit encountering vaccinated population population antibodies. See singapore/Uk... Never seen group people ineptly try hide stupidity regular basis! vaccinated also likely overrepresented covid stats anyway, various reasons (e.g., targeted screenings health care settings).

This feels like dangerous assumption. vaccinated population likely simply cold-like symptoms, thus get tested COVID Delta variant? first Pfizer shot month half ago, month ago Covid, didnt major issues, loss smell.
Should get second vaccine no? Also yes, when.
Because doctor said idea do......  know sure typical neverending selfregenerating journalistic ability exaggerate single scientific facts level complete apocalyptic absurdity It‚Äôs known Covid spread via surfaces extremely rare. couple Clorox wipes plenty. three poor sanitation hygiene won‚Äôt help am, walking around. Raw doggin' life lmao Yes, countries while, it‚Äôs working fine. Pfizer Moderna functionally thing. planning keep 2 year old home vaccination available him/her? doesn‚Äôt come? I‚Äôm genuinely asking parent also 2 year old. feel like point risks Covid accepted managed like disease frankly it‚Äôs never going away. lifetime probably children‚Äôs. 

I say person got pertussis adult despite fully vaccinated/boostered (thanks part won‚Äôt vaccinate). job came risk exposure unlucky, came away reactive asthma I‚Äôm sick. know darn well happen. even pretend keep kiddo safe without drastic maybe damaging measures?

Point discussion; attack. cooling restrictions Pfizer Moderna much reduced since vaccins first introduced also slow July August since Biontech delivered promised vaccines earlier promised next month ~3.5million doses biontech week compared ~5.5 million june. people wait first dose since many doses needed second doses.

Edit:
TLDR see comment elaborates already. see first  Thanks reply comments.

Yep, kind numbers things crazy pushed medical system limits.

I think right believing there's actually cases, vaccinated people get symptoms pretty mild, get ""cold"" regular ""illness"". Because, belief/thought Covid symptoms always ""bad"", experiencing must Covid. 5 weeks mRNA anywhere 4 12 weeks AstraZeneca. AstraZeneca first doses really given anymore, second doses, 12 weeks apart initially. allowed pull forward second doses anywhere 4 12 weeks there's enough doses.  official name [EU Digital COVID also mentioned first sentence linked BBC article.

But yeah, really trip tongue. ""COVID pass/passport"" maybe? won‚Äôt considered fully vaccinated 14 days, wouldn‚Äôt officially approved take mask gym then. 

Don‚Äôt push super hard. myocarditis side effect still like one million, moderate paced cardio isn‚Äôt problem. Maybe chill sprints HIIT week two. 

You work day you‚Äôre feeling it, though. worst case arm might sore, lifting might fun, might feel tired feel like it, that‚Äôs decision. Stay hydrated, though. seems help prevent cruddy feeling people get. paste text please? Probably, document giving (for Swedish residents want travel) others currently. Maybe fully ready incorporate info, currently reports vaccinations.  5 weeks first second jab. grand scheme things week nothing. cases myocarditis 2nd dose occur around day 4 2nd dose. didn‚Äôt take easy week issue would regret it? People Australia want vaccines pain butt government didn‚Äôt order enough Pfizer 60s sitting ducks. alternative avoid stage Ah alrighty then, correct, used hear passport vaccinal months ago changed. might say stopped listening news months ago covid, bad! Funny exact reverse eastern side world, everyone concerned Biontech instead. 

Anyways, thank you. Got first dose morning. Everything fine now. fact bit fine, actually. never got vaccinated. probably overthinking. get one Doctor. heard many doctors Astrazeneca doses left want Biontech even Biontech doses availiable like 2 weeks. really want dose try get Astrazeneca local doctor opinion changed affected personally

We call people ""conservatives""  See, we're opposite. We've never given offline option. eldest gone end class 9 beginning first year intermediate without day school--no practicals, assignments, substandard video classes. (Well, fair: class X horrible; intermediate least trying can.) good children's development stuck home 16 months glued screen day. parent I've always tried limit much screen time kids get, pandemic response completely upended us. least form education. poor smartphones broadband.

Meanwhile covid months ago. barely sick. kids see wonder can't go school. Sure, everybody easy covid did, mild sickness far likely outcome worse one. years back, though, got dengue school, ended ICU. shut everything 20% 1st dose vaccination total

Yes, adults. long think going take finish that? take well next year. try rush vaccination kids, taking shots away vulnerable adults? That's way would even remotely possible get vaccinated academic year. So, basically we're asking sacrifice least two years education childhood. That's horrible thing demand kids. Holy shit Australian government fuck bad?  believe Sweden required *accept* three EUDCC criteria since rules EU-wide. surprised get invitation quickly. I‚Äôm 20s. Mastered Autonomous Delta Plus Instinct 2 Sad norwegian noises someone stood line almost 2 hours second shot mass vaccination location yesterday day someone infected definitely worrying 

*cries Australian* Germany doses rn following weeks get less biontech vaccines delivered earlier lets see Germany China said beat covid May 2020. 

Because did? China able contain virus. Italy USA done pandemic may averted. chose profits people's lives. Swedish version reports vaccinations, previous COVID-19 positive testing negative. realize anti-vax movement started UK tends even bigger places like France. heard government botched every potential vaccine deal, biggest one Pfizer. heard got J&amp;J recently could wrong point out, LOT symptoms could due mental fatigue quarantined lockdown - especially sleep disorders, migraines, anxiety, depression. fact, we've already seen articles average American gained weight pandemic. could also lead high blood pressure, higher cholesterol, digestion issues, malaise fatigue. I'm trying explain things away, I'm going remain skeptical point get hard evidence influenced unusual factors like lockdowns stress living pandemic. doubt countries like Australia NZ wanting open tourists 70% vaccinated.  Could please show source?

Also, apply unvaccinated people? Hate tell this, cases rising UK since May 8th. That's 54 days. death rate massively reduced. mean pandemic me, fully vaccinated person, frankly over. going whatever want vaccinated state (61% fully vax‚Äôd) government says can.

That said, circumstances forced go work (if don‚Äôt need to) send kids school you‚Äôre uncomfortable. 

So one hand, yes people gladly go back normalcy, hand, may seem doesn‚Äôt mean people like want to/should continue taking pandemic precautions

I‚Äôm 25 fully vaccinated going live life. I‚Äôm gonna go around licking unvaccinated people spitting kids though. Billions people earth going unvaccinated years. tiny amount breakthrough cases US vaccinated population what's going drive variant development. law entitled SSP tho quarantine big step send men life assumed weak whiny feeling like shit second Moderna shot. Fortunately, male roommate got second shot week half also felt like shit, helped reputation little. hear people telling vaccines aren‚Äôt 100% effective. Therefore, say, wear mask. makes sense me. never ever risk getting Covid hospitalized. There‚Äôs always going chance vaccines better anything frankly could hoped year ago saves 25 million people spend winter covid community.

48 weeks last 52 weeks, nightclubs open Perth, there's need masks. Basically capacity limits.

Our first case since last April community Feb year. given relative normalcy - can't contain disease, we're looking full European/American 2020 experience. wants opt that? usually put Russia Europe. Adult trials went quick spread high, didn‚Äôt take long see clear difference experimental placebo groups. 

12-17 took little longer, spread wasn‚Äôt high. took longer get number. 

11 encountered something others didn‚Äôt. None experimental group gotten sick, also, none placebo group really gotten sick either. They‚Äôre draw blood look antibody formation indicator effectiveness, case load low, kids somewhat resistant begin with, they‚Äôre catching fast enough measure effectiveness way. 
 
as here. may something this. India ordered billion novavax? can't generalize. lot guesses side effects, little serious research. neglect second dose. need delta virus comes town. [Ohio St. beats 10 days video games Netflix though, 10 days schoolwork home Nuh. people. person die Putin war hesitation also refusing vaccine ""government something.""

The duality like strong Russians. got Mario Kart 64 could totally go 10 days isolation. new delta Delta plus strain lives longer outside. rather keep bit safer not. That‚Äôs still much better flu vaccine true better anything could hoped original vaccine. Also, numbers true also preliminary. People freaked past variants rejected extension offer extraordinary terms, forced move everything location July 4th (Independence Day),"" 

Weird definition ‚Äúforced‚Äù. I'm honestly curious many people per day, planet wide, cleaning bathroom. Going global scale least per day. thought immune escape also inhibits ability spread ideal: ‚ö†Ô∏èIt's beginning. Patients southwest #Missouri starting transferred hospitals, hundreds miles away, hospitals become filled COVID patients. 38% #Missouri fully vaccinated &amp; #DeltaVariant infections surging want literal, yes. people mean say science says something that‚Äôs conclusion is. think that‚Äôs people mean. CDC says people safe, talking general. It‚Äôs like trying lie anything. saying fact overwhelmingly much likely safe not. 

It would really weird wording CDC say you‚Äôre mostly safe. Yes, true still get Covid lot less people getting getting seriously sick.

Also, went focusing hospitalizations almost solely Covid cases like right now. consider safe apparently getting Covid. That‚Äôs fine doesn‚Äôt mean everyone panic like cases media doing

Also, thing 100%. never likely day there‚Äôs risk could go more, honestly. 90 days, according Currently, data safety efficacy COVID-19 vaccines people received monoclonal antibodies convalescent plasma part COVID-19 treatment. Based estimated half-life therapies evidence suggesting reinfection uncommon 90 days initial infection, vaccination deferred least 90 days. precautionary measure additional information becomes available, avoid potential interference antibody therapy vaccine-induced immune responses. recommendation applies people receive passive antibody therapy receiving vaccine dose receive passive antibody therapy first dose mRNA vaccine second dose, case second dose deferred least 90 days following receipt antibody therapy. Receipt passive antibody therapy past 90 days contraindication receipt COVID-19 vaccine. COVID-19 vaccine doses received within 90 days receipt passive antibody therapy need did! month J&amp;J like you. Thought cold totally lost taste smell. went pharmacy said vaccinated. question that. 2 vax cards matter me. think registry complete people think. 2 friends thing. None us went locations JJ Pfizer none us questioned. Target, Walgreens, CVS, community clinic, county vax clinic... can't remember saw statistic, think CDC. field use, Phizer vaccine shows 0.46% failure rate. 10th advertised failure rate is. caveat population intensely monitored, 0.46% people proactively go get diagnosed suspect they're sick. Less third people ever hospitalized.

So people say 95% protection, remaining 5% considered failure, 90% asymptomatic person never even notice got infection.

So yes I'm completely done it. people [substantial] risk people choosing get vaccinated. choices come consequences. poor choices way restrict me, rest society. probably mixed feelings. one hand might happy skip work situation clarified. other, need share quarantine teenagers kids. prospect I'd look forward. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

All gotta say ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want wear mask‚Äù

For me, saying ‚ÄúI part‚Äù isn‚Äôt life wanna live. much necessary collective good people.

It really seems decision makes like enjoyable you. completely fine. I‚Äôll wear mask too!

No shade all. I‚Äôm wearing masks people ‚Äúdid part it‚Äôs turn enjoy life I‚Äôm gonna put hold anti Vaxxer‚Äù

I excited incorporating fashion. Fair? Hows fair would spend (speaking theoretically ofc Europe) 14 days homejailed even didnt catch anything? say let Nintendo name it, New Delta Motion Plus Knuckles also know vaccine. safe say vaccine might developed rush humans always make errors, predict cases. makes think vaccine better catching covid naturally long term? even engaged appeal authority emphasizing podcast people's credentials.

I'm checking TWiV now, thank you! guess appeal authority say correct say ""Hey guys know what's going on."" Instead, said, ""I wondering experts think"" based data put forth, said so. 

I'm curious see everyone else saying. know scientific community wrong someone qualified something different say, listen see they're refuted. That's all. 

Does mean anyone something else say line CDC big agencies automatically discounted? everyone downvoted original post listened podcast? equivalent listening flat-earthers complete waste time?

For record, I've Pfizer shots. So, want avoid misconception I'm anti-vaxx you. got J&amp;J vaccine mid April. month later got covid (mild case lose taste smell). doctors know makes immune Delta variant?  think certainly, vaccination efforts progress, needs serious conversation production-output diverted towards non-western countries.

A lot people like say country supposedly duty towards citizens, we're seeing increases cases across Asia Africa, countries, even medical personnel get vaccinated.

I think recent podcast Economist stated dozens doctors nurses dying Africa every day Covid, whilst we're considering expanding vaccinations extremely low-risk under-18 categories.

I'm saying never vaccinate people, think delaying speed vaccinations towards tail end total vaccination, might worth it, mean allowing medical personnel 3rd world countries vaccinated faster, preventing medical infrastructure collapsing.

A doctor dying 3rd world country much damage long-term, really incomprehensible. Hell, maybe publishing grad school theses design better clinical tests can't faked easily 10 years. kind thing usually people became scientists grew doing. Ivermectin used early ‚ÄúThrow everything see anything works‚Äù phase. actual results pretty unimpressive. 

The therapeutics shown repeatable effectiveness numbers antibody cocktails, vitamin D, steroid drug called dexamethasone. None miracle cures, they‚Äôre pretty marginal, probably better nothing. 

Despite early anecdotal possibilities, neither hydroxychloroquine ivermectin panned out. put controlled trial, early reports seem luck part patients given drugs.  Nah, everyone particularly likes socializing time. Especially since would temporary, 10 day break people sounds heavenly select group. TLDR: Estrogen activates B cell immune response. Testosterone not. like that, happened back high school accidentally making chlorine. rest chem class library day.  Science really process acquiring data. still needs interpreted ‚Äúsay‚Äù anything. Data saying vaccinated people still getting Delta variant, despite CDC saying ‚Äúvaccinated people safe unmask‚Äù. Science isn‚Äôt saying ‚Äúyou‚Äôre safe‚Äù. *People* are, they‚Äôre *mostly* correct, 100%. Science never says anything. Transmission outdoors really issue, indoors prolonged exposure [doesn't look I'd really like information/research year goes get studies post-vaccination. No, do, easing restrictions depend entirely confidence. last case community confident enough open nightclubs weekend, easy. funny rules 2wks, easy ""snap back"".

But can't give confidence could infected, could that? they'd assume worse scenarios. literally costing millions people time energy, mate need quarantine 14 days. How's fair? - guess citrus general actual oranges yeah cool.

It's weird think like everything smell taste etc. chemicals could synthesise them. Food Chemistry pretty interesting. already dominant Ontario...woot?  indication happen though? good points people knowing you‚Äôve vaccinated it‚Äôs always going way. There‚Äôs always going portion population one reason another don‚Äôt get shot. people, it‚Äôs feel vaccines rushed. others, don‚Äôt think personally need it. like there‚Äôs million different reasons people chose get vaccinated - it‚Äôs reason

At end day, way see part. wore mask year even though couldn‚Äôt see friends virus, couldn‚Äôt see people‚Äôs faces lot people big deal. people don‚Äôt want faces seen acne something else entirely fine that‚Äôs choose. me, it‚Äôs nice able see people‚Äôs reactions smile - that‚Äôs part human feel like somewhat lose masks on.

Yes, ways show excited mask it‚Äôs me. got vaccinated part. someone else isn‚Äôt vaccinated, likely isn‚Äôt even going wearing mask, do?

I know could say wear mask don‚Äôt want wear one rest life someone else‚Äôs decision made themselves. CDC says safe others that‚Äôs go by.

Some people sub though act like vaccinated don‚Äôt wear mask you‚Äôre killing people something decision. Telling people mask still get vaccine two messages conflict

It‚Äôs objectionable true someone speeding would save lives. people speed though - it‚Äôs something control choose deliberatively 10 days get Kara attuned without interrruptions... think knew ""may,"" kind looking hard evidence one way other. seems bit leap.Personally love world again,but automatically something wrong someone else want that. It‚Äôs slowing uk it? guess speaking context vaccinated since article revisiting idea masking back now, US, even highly vaccinated areas.

I feel like mask catches less 30% droplets useless vaccinated person showing symptoms disease, mean, I'm epidemiologist.

As is, see lot mask skeptics say reusing mask without washing pointless, wearing one gapes horrifically pointless, wearing one 30% effective top two things makes like theater public safety. feels like we've done nothing teach people actually construct obtain well fitting, effective mask. ""literally anything better nothing"" approach entire time, even areas inhabitants made serious effort comply guidelines. Sounds like dub vaccine, sucks got infected worked advertised get vaccine anyways? Even compromised, percent efficacy zero lemons smell like oranges?

I‚Äôm guessing kind carbonyl aldehyde. ""my son COVID 7 times fine, nobody needs vaccine"" media downplayed virus needs held liable. Australians though, poses greater risk Covid currently due low transmission is. think bad even ""only"" thousand vaccinated Americans die delta variants.  delta crisis control need masks social distancing, large companies forcing workers exposed risk face liability.  man island. - John Donne Welp we‚Äôre gonna wear masks forever mean isolation parents tho never said was. said it‚Äôs totally normal vaccine less 100% efficacy. reason go backwards reopening. image: 2020 electron microscope image made available U.S. Centers Disease Control Prevention shows spherical particles new coronavirus, colorized blue, first U.S. case COVID-19.

So may right may wrong. Ivermectin widely available dogs horses .. De-worming purposes.

Presumably also effectiveness reducing covid dogs - could reduce virus reservoir pets.

mods may approve comment - factually true, relevant topic. feel like headlines almost chosen sow FUD vaccines. Instead ""less 15% Delta virus cases among vaccinated"" (which would make vaccine seem good), instead focuses ""not 100% protection"" side, making look bad. 

No, hide fact breakthrough cases among vaccinated people. context.   Good luck getting ahead life first DNA vaccine world !!?? (for humans).
Fingers crossed Half Texas behaved like primary throughout pandemic still does. Don‚Äôt try argue them. see world ball pit can‚Äôt get jobs succeed life ‚Äògo back school‚Äô get right. Birmo Wormtongue great distraction hack health system still gotten back fully yet. got vaccination data today. USA recently using vaccines produced locally exported. 

I think USA relaxed ban export, could also case case basis.

Europe also threaten Pfizer Europe ban export.

We expect many countries develop national capacity mass produce vaccines near future. find incredibly sad. need lock now. 

They won't. people die good reason. Covid cases general among vaccinated. 100% protection.  Lol people still go outside house can't go anywhere public. Lots outside home  I'm wondering well. Losing gray brain matter scares me. operative word May boring.  Women could likely report side effects. real hassle Sweden.

The fact lot people realized werent paid enough put shit deal with. got paid minimum wage coughed sneezed customers wearing masking maybe 30 hours week lucky. friends getting thousands per month unemployment. would want job, especially poorly many people reacted pandemic.

I don‚Äôt like wearing mask it‚Äôs really hard so. CDC's guidance clean soap/detergent first Clean visibly dirty surfaces household cleaners containing soap detergent disinfecting disinfectant product cleaning agent (check label verify).

And disinfection necessary 24 **After person sick longer needs Wait long possible (at least several hours) clean **Less 24 hours:** Follow guidance cleaning disinfecting someone sick. Clean disinfect surfaces areas sick person used (such bedroom bathroom) enter areas less 24 hours person longer sick.

Btw edited comment give generalized info (not asthmatic) long covid, based studies Italy UK earlier pandemic.

As hyper focused mortality hospitalization, long covid getting little attention. hope there's fresher data kids 12 get released. Covaxin aiming September kids btw. chance &lt;18 get Covaxin There's way know specific case, average severity vaccinated people much less severity unvaccinated people. deserved downvotes dumb question. Kids fake illness injury get school time.

If vaccine works, useful vaccinating hard reach places! **half children contract covid-19 may lasting symptoms**, factor decisions reopening schools, reports Helen Thomson

Evidence first study long covid children suggests half children aged 6 16 years old contract virus **at least one symptom lasting 120 days, 42.6 per cent impaired symptoms daily activities**. interim results based periodic assessments 129 children **Italy** diagnosed covid-19 March November 2020 Gemelli University Hospital Rome (medRxiv, doi.org/fv9t).

The **UK Office** National Statistics's latest report estimates **12.9 per cent UK children aged 2 11, 14.5 per cent children aged 12 16, still symptoms five weeks first infection**. Almost 500,000 UK children tested positive covid-19 since March 2020. I‚Äôm bartender working busy bar I‚Äôve working without mask (CA recently removed mask mandate). I‚Äôm fully vaxxed, live area high vaccination rates. think worried? could even worse. people catch virus still believe virus exists!    I'd argue already two Americas.  epitome smart yet stupid  yet still panicked another four weeks I'm wondering eating lemon taking test skews results too...

I remember drinking rose syrup rinsing mouth fake sore throat youth. said ‚Äúrefuses vaccine‚Äù. rural areas basically walk-in appointments available 4 months now. excuses people. Yes, course. That's one reason pro-vaccination.
Those vulnerable might want take additional precautions like wearing mask minimizing public contact. Oh absolutely, I'm one second suggesting anything great points make regarding availability vaccines home take priority. like said point start see vaccines arms put beginning seen. shortage issue still globally that's I'd love see western governments come together structured way. much pandemic we've reactively dealing vaccine production hitting stride time take proactive measures develop plan get vaccines everyone. going happen overnight course start prepare logistics mechanics worldwide distribution. I'd also like able donate way gets jabs arms money much collectively people could make dent this. three billion shots administered worldwide something like 10 billion go. punishment. reprieve harsher sentence. like offering someone community service instead jail time.

Heck point, object throwing people jail getting vaccine. pleasure! article/interview elaborates points: 

  Urging people policy video show rapid test, test positive take PCR confirm result.

It basically allow quickly isolate potential positive accurate results obtained.

PCR tricked chemical basically genetic photocopier. point, it‚Äôs overblown bit idea many articles Australia sub. getting like 30 million Pfizer 10 million Moderna shots September December year. That‚Äôs enough vaccinate remaining population easily. many countries won‚Äôt get fully vaccinated well 2022. would imply I‚Äôd pay additional $2400 taxes because, federal income taxes still same. That‚Äôs crazy! I‚Äôm all! 

Also 300 billion interest payment 28.5 trillion dollar ‚Äúdebt‚Äù comes 1.05% interest rate. Doesn‚Äôt sound bad me! way CDC issue guidance state local level. 

The problem is, states low vaccination rates going mask up. going breading ground new varients foothold foreign varients. could fuck states done right thing.

Math could off, late im rusty people expected 1st gen vaccines, actually ended effective basically stopped infection altogether - delta.

It's good bad. Good, safe. Bad, circulate vaccinated populations, constantly ""looking for"" weaknesses, vs vaccines vs bodies around (unvaccinated, kids).

The latter really must get boosters they're offer, even presents mild hayfever vaccinated, try prevent circulation much possible. science fully supports first dose vectored vaccine second dose mRNA. fda approved. actually known new side effect. rare possible. Also know long term effects vaccine young beat covid easily believe without side effects. actually know someone young athletic got covid developed severe side effects? Young mean 25  mix'n'matching 2nd doses ok? got pzfifzer scheduled 2nd dose moderna parents wishes sure, accepted universal truth: vaccines good, no. vaccines job. good thing. Ofcourse cases rise. Currently, every country, affected people teenagers. weird, LAST LINE get shot. Fingers (and toes) crossed! wife staying vigilant over. would damage heart? confirm Indiana. Went shopping today saw masks. me. teenagers said shit told em, ‚ÄúI got back New York can‚Äôt taste smell‚Äù 

They backed up. not? believe huge influence ""testen voor toegang"" testing entry, positive cases get registered GGD negative tests registered daily amount weekly one. testen voor toegang testing capacity increased lot. get wrong, Delta increasing may slip luck. Ugh, fear mongering. Guess could've seen one coming. Vaccinations ramping ... today, 70% received one dose WAIT 5~6 weeks receive second one. takes time can't give people shot get with. Seeing DELTA variant rising countries, we'll likely get spike cases hospital admissions. Keep mind there's ton people want vaccine ""bUT 10 YeArS YoUlL DeD!"". delta variant infections among vaccinated, strange huh? Besides, delta variant extremely infectious, looks like symptoms less severe previous variants. 

COVID-19 continue mutate world continue adapt. Countries suffered multiple waves vaccinating like crazy numbers show that. Sure, might get spikes ... long country hit 100% vaccination treshold, numbers always go up/down ... O, forgot mention people fully vaccinated get COVID-19 mostly show symptoms. percentage people get sick, vaccinated, extremely low. eradicate it, since already endemic There's base claims, (rather pessimistic) predicting. Also there's still lot restrictions, want live world considered 'back normal'. I, myself, unfortunately qualified open positions. capability vaccinate whole world years. hand, variants appearing faster vaccinate. 

The messaging vaccines working terrifies anything. know people strong side effects declared take dose. 

The best expect vaccines still offer descent protection incoming variants. sounds quite similar Netherlands, government said masks necessary Dutch know keep distance. true. country dense (physically).

They avoided requiring masks DECEMBER. discredited idea well saw reason wear anyway. Sounds really similar state. thought Delta probably even virus's final form scary. Definitely germany least Biontech What‚Äôs source ‚Äúconclusion‚Äù Covid killed million? link methodology. Yes does. 3 layer mask protects 40% remember. 

This article isn‚Äôt individual protection, it‚Äôs community infection spread. Good. Go India. That‚Äôs article said all. said mask usage community - including people wearing wrong, anti-maskers, etc- reduced infection spread 25%. individual immunity. wear n95, individual protection still 95% ""citing evidence cases Singapore""

From Singapore. cases delta plus reported understanding mutations occur random. host immunity vaccine resistant mutant able compete existing strains mutation usually causes virus less evolutionary fit way vanilla strain. hosts vaccine natural immunity suddenly new mutant different enough spike protein able compete original strain evade antibodies better original. mutant becomes dominant strain.

 paper posted recently talk calculate based mutation rate sars-cov-2 long take get single, double, triple, 4 way everywhere Oklahoma OKC Tulsa! think fact variant transmissible see increase cases. masks effective would see increase cases despite increase transmissiblity. gonna take longer reach herd immunity due fact it‚Äôs state highest population *this* country.

California six months ago 45k new cases 550 daily deaths. June 1k new cases 20-30 daily deaths.  


California got 50% fully vaccinated 61% got one shot, make Californa one vaccinated state/region world. E.g. UK 48% vaccinated, US 46%. 


California already extremely well already, daily cases &amp; deaths substantially compared 6 months ago. vaccinations extremely well too.  might well measures avoid health crisis created greater economic one deep shit. Failing secure crops comes mind.  ""You get $1000 tax refund, get vaccinated.""

Yesssss!!!!!  pandemic really altered world view considerably, especially regarding scientific expertise. Living country (Sweden) called ['open-air [96.000 people predicted die June (real number around 6.000), [while time modelers said would herd immunity Stockholm (still waiting that). [Now, terms death, Sweden looks like average European 

This made realize things hope take forward future.

1. People speak certainty highly uncertain situations overestimating ability analyze situation. Predictions routinely wrong time. [Just look sheer range predictions made US May 
2. We've fallen unscientific traps confusing correlation causation. last year tendency associating every change pandemic trajectory specific events behaviors. Pictures people beach Florida lead overly certain predictions coming rise cases. sure people think winter wave US caused holidays, really true places like mid-west cases started rising rapidly October. truth probably ton randomness causes virus peak different places different times, despite uncertainty fundamental part science, public health officials seemed reluctant say 'we know'. 
3. Lastly, pandemic showed people varying levels numeracy. really blame lay-people interested statistics know back hand problems using CFR measure anything reported cases might equal true cases -- however expect journalists scientists know difference. I've seen truly horrible hot takes little statistical criticism easily shown misleading. Eric Feigl-Ding worst this, gish gallop stats impossible assess without spending hours it. 

I think perspective also warped viewing debates media Twitter. constantly remind self-selected group represents different fringes type people go nuts speaking publicly highly contentious issues. probably deeper reservoir experts much nuanced (and boring media) hidden people. really July. Moderna deliver expected, yeah, still little lower Biontech's deliveries June. advantages (in paper least). require exigent cooling requirements Pfizer vaccine (and lesser extend Moderna's). requires smaller dose translated safer profile (i.e. less side effects) theoretically higher production. things important rest world.

We need recall Curevac among first companies vaccine candidate. deemed promising sparked diplomatic incident US Germany, Trump tried bankroll it.

Edit: shows mRNA magic always produce excellent results. wait, there's more! contract virus next 24 hours, we'll include additional viral load FREE ^just ^pay ^s&amp;h tests $40.

They free take private pharmacies, think they're expensive. there's plenty places get tests free, least Mexico City.

I mean, I'm suggesting death toll underestimated. experience, many problems tests (at least urban areas). using unmodified mRNA. 2 using modified mRNA. modifications allow greater amounts protein produced per mRNA, also makes much safer use large doses mRNA.

Honestly haven‚Äôt heard anything yet returning back level 3 masks. Unfortunately patients get upset don‚Äôt see doctor wearing N95 that. Looking back December UK getting around 20k cases per day looks like getting around 200 - 600 deaths per day. 0.3% CFR directly wave. 

I agree everyone old vaccinated everyone 30 unvaccinated, CFR would even lower. not. Back everyone old wanted vaccinated was, 2000 daily cases 5-10 daily deaths. Since they've vaccinated younger people, (trivially) raise CFR.

They giving first doses people 20s, almost purely raise CFR.

There two possible exceptions: Alpha lot deadlier Delta, lot breakthrough positive tests (that course lead deaths). load people know UK caught Covid (presumably Delta 95% cases) double vaccinations. cases symptoms mild thought hayfever. cases like flu. Nobody seriously ill. UK hospitalisations almost exclusively unvaccinated people old  like, would call that.....*OOh.* That‚Äôs everyone kids. First off, deaths many 26k cases per day 14 deaths per day seems low hospital/icu numbers. wrong? everyone thread apparently even read article.

We knew early single layer cloth masks 10-20% triple layers 40%.

This study talking individual protection. People reading study talking protection virus spreading, study all.

It linking reported mask usage infection levels made 25% difference.

You people wearing varying levels masks, skirting rules, refusing masks factors play.

Individual protection remains, N95 going reduce chance 95% more. say eyes also way people infected distance barriers matter well, also see studies showing people glasses infected way less. Likely less likely touch eyes, less spit/droplets eyes etc. 

Forgetting eyes mask still filtering 95% providing 95% infection.

Also Redfield made remarks, true efficacy vaccines known.

To day people still understand masks, virus spreads misreading articles.

This nothing individual protection, protection offer others. People wearing masks lower, improperly, distance, skirting rules, refusal wear masks 25% effective.

That sounds great! guess won‚Äôt ready Delta, perhaps help prevent spread variants that. Radical suggestion: keep wearing mask. know body, go get tested. Would totally experience intense joint pain every booster shot too. Real covid way way way way worse pandemic infected everyone .1% people go hospital .05% died, see shutdowns. cost benefit analysis Except many vaccinated admitted hospitals even dying. good perfect like imply. also many died soon 2nd shot, there‚Äôs many don‚Äôt want it.

We've masks month cases, hospitalizations, deaths still declined. Stop acting like know science  assumes repercussions get vaccinated. Seems like places around (Michigan) saying ""mask unvaccinated, mask vaccinated."" actually checking. Low behold, since unvaccinated largely believe virus care, everyone unmasked.

I heard universities requiring vaccines, cruise ships think blip heard cruise ships even admitted going actually check status order get around Florida's ""No vaccine passport"" laws.

The reality people gottan vaccinated probably wish bit separation, one enforces it. Huh didn‚Äôt mention China? hope one actually carries wallet. Take fucking photo - BOOM - vax record Photos instead Google Pay.

And open photos.google.com devices. Sinovac 50-60% effective symptoms, 70-75% hospitalization death. third dose Pfizer likely boost two-dose mRNA efficacy (~90% / 95% respectively) - significant improvement high risk populations. Awe thank appreciate much. loved home long, hard do. Best family! No, said AstraZeneca vaccine. point was, beginning said 1 million, actually 1/55,000. point insistent rare, became evident wasn‚Äôt.

 Saying 600,000 means absolutely nothing. vaccine gonna bring people back life something?? misleading. Nearly 2000 Covid cases linked fans travelled London. hasn‚Äôt determined caught large groups carried them.  Two things: 1) good parent, hope nobody ever convinces otherwise. 2) whatever happens vaccinate child COVID, made best decision could given information time. 45 weeks? That‚Äôs almost year! Surely mean 45 days?  Lockdown mainly. Also pre delta variant first dose seemed help curb spread somewhat. reason England's info seems anything regarding Pfizer Yeah nobody drove cars we‚Äôd deaths auto accidents. fact, reduce deaths zero nobody allowed leave house reason whatsoever. Anything name Safety! sore arm 2 days, don‚Äôt really count side effect. shot's different, vaccine recipient (or least immune system) is. case people previous covid infections seem likely systemic side effects first dose opposed second immune system already encountered covid spike protein infection (although individual responses vary people side effects beyond arm soreness).  Germany hah! Homeopathy invented still popular, also one main markets obscure esoteric agriculture stuff.

Probably fewer completely gone crazies though. think that's called authoritarianism. Headline reads like Onion article. I'm sure millions stories like many come. like flu cant eradicated comes every year, corona time info moderna comes get impression grandparents way, despite grandmother (80) almost dying stomach flu earlier year, refuses believe covid concern.

Like one guy blew pandemic wife caught died? sad also completely preventable people.would take shit seriously least useful test case whether possible ""live with"" COVID highly-vaccinated population. probably learn whether severe vaccine breakthrough cases numerous enough worry about.

I hope so, think suppression possible, know deaths start increasing (even increase slowly used to) seem callous argument make.

Delta last variant, immune-evasive, almost feel like test case whether world stay like forever. admit really bad way look it. don‚Äôt understand‚Ä¶ go game covid? see comment above. That's great health agency (the US CDC next nothing proactive like expect it). really surprising result, then. Still hard imagine, though. wonder there's off-camera interaction the, like sitting nearby coffee shop something? spent hours week listening press conferences Australian premiers chief health officers explaining 4 capital cities currently lockdown, then.

Trust me, they're spooked. say terms ""fleeting contact"", seem define &lt; 5 minutes. record, 10s, perhaps due winter, us unmasked, low vaccination percentage virus finding relatively easy infect people brief periods.

And term like ""whole households infected"". familiar covid know happens, believe happening often before, spooking them.

But surprising, believed much infectious already infectious variant? Never worn mask, never will.

What's going happen me? He's right mark pandemic, even calling couple things like pandemic largely socially June accurately Fauci. CureVac approach mRNA seem lot rising numbers driven clusters specific counties low vaccination rates, massive statewide waves. Moderna boi also here.

No. reality. opposite - encouraging complacency risk lives.

A virus exists host infectious long making ill enough isolated pressure evolve either less dangerous. opportunities reproduce different hosts, chances undergo random mutation makes deadly. ""oh god we're gonna die deadly tomorrow"" - becomes deadly children? 

A chance mutation brought us here, chance mutation make things worse. That's weird, live lots people still wearing masks indoors. could also lot people trying non-scientific treatments suggested government and/or pastors, cloroquina ivermeticina medicine. poison kids take get real treatment situation significantly worse.

For mRNA vaccines? Go on, find citation. Remember let‚Äôs honest, couldn‚Äôt care less side effects.

Sure, let's ignore pile 600,000 dead Americans one person died sIdE eFFeCtS vaccine country.  It‚Äôs shit show get go.

But vaccine roll Australia total shambles? Personally I'd say right.  feels like reduction line many variants (I believe almost identical reduction seen Delta), less severe reduction variants (Beta 8 fold reduction).

What's got price fish? Delta variant, responsible coronavirus infections England, driving surge new hospitalizations there, according data released Public Health England Thursday. 
 
Although number coronavirus infections risen sharply recent weeks, hospitalization rates remain low. every 100,000 new cases England, 1.9 admitted hospital. 
 
That rate, based data collected June 21 June 27, previous week remains considerably lower England‚Äôs surge last winter. January, hospitalization rate peaked 37.2 hospital admissions every 100,000 cases. 
 
The data suggest countries high vaccination rates unlikely see major surges hospitalizations Delta. Nearly 75 percent adults England ‚Äî including 95 percent 80 older ‚Äî least one shot, according agency‚Äôs numbers. 
 
Earlier month, England delayed plans reopen Delta caused spike new cases. 
 
Case rates highest among young adults, least likely vaccinated, Public Health England reported. (Among 40, 34 percent least partially vaccinated.) Young people less likely develop severe Covid-19, could explain spread Delta resulted wave hospitalizations.  ELI5 please? worth it. Feeling bit day something worth fixing. Also tailor-made doses come different type problems. mention logistics it. I'm you. I'm stunned people this.   ‚Äúnormal‚Äù times I‚Äôd say you‚Äôre spot on. Looking back another time history like Spanish Flu‚Ä¶. barely understood masks wearing them. science understand manufacture effective masks (no underarmor gators)

Would say global pandemic like Spanish Flu it‚Äôs everyone‚Äôs responsibility slow spread?

PS. got 2 doses. find much honest sincere trying imply vaccine makes utterly immune Covid variants known yet known. would imagine choice. that‚Äôs kwazy Thanks, mean? 
Do understand correctly, specific variant completely ignores mRNA vaccination? That's still months away. Surely urgent problem seems. there's talk developing sort system akin European Commission's links various national databases together. can't imagine won't. mRNA numbers ""boost"" effect completely speculative. 

Re: Coronavac - numbers line found studies. want take higher end view, Chile showed 65% efficacy, 85% protection hospitalization, 80% protection death. However, Chile's study issues risk matching given large-scale sample (2.5M) community protection effect vaccines given high rates (same risk matching issues Israel later stage studies overstated Pfizer's effectiveness) - therefore real risk-matched efficacy likely bit lower.  numbers compare case breakdown unvaccinated people? remember hearing something like 5% covid cases require hospitalization, assume they're classifying severe, seems 60% reduction severe cases among vaccinated breakthrough infections (on top lower probability infection due ot vaccinated)?

Restores faith people. :)  samsies - week balancing nighmare schedule working teaching kids. neighbors basically chilled home. they've access months. know, bad copied link. get past this? Yep, total vaccinations go up, total hospitalizations go down, by-age hospitalizations go down, elderly vaccinated much higher rates, *proportion* decreasing hospitalizations increasingly tends toward younger ages, even though younger age hospitalization also declining, fast. used ton air tests VOCs people's houses part monitoring program vapor intrusion site.

Still phenomenal. vaccinated person gets apparently damn near 100% asymptomatic. We're unsure spreads via asymptomatic vaccinated person yet iirc.

The important takeaway is: FUCKS SAKE GET VACCINATED can‚Äôt draw conclusions singular example, thankfully plenty (PLENTY) studies say vaccines vastly reduce severity symptoms case breakthrough. skepticism really misguided.  Thanks! link damages young patients?  fun stopped cctv became widespread. places used loiter kids longer do. mischief used get fear thing past (in sense one). come ASBO generation all‚Ä¶ Delta variant tripping many well before, including Taiwan Australia much this. quickly ramped west get point substantial majority population we're going quickly lose interest drive get vaccine people like say country supposedly duty towards citizens

I would hope people realise one's country duty care firstly much individual (be individual person country) whole. Getting world vaccinated everyone's interest morally, fiscally health think delaying speed vaccinations towards tail end total vaccination, might worth it, mean allowing medical personnel 3rd world countries vaccinated

I doubt would even needed given scale purchases made. Simply divert unneeded supply elsewhere (granted work cases). going terrible see hit tail end see much wastage unused vaccine. western nations purchased far need (in total delivered) level output far easier maintain ramp up.

The west help distribution funding supply sharing expertise we've built last year managing roll outs. Except watch netflix schoolwork eat/pee whenever want also wake hour later. Oh, meant indoors. 10% less people area wear mask indoors. DMV earlier glanced around room around 20 people saw 1 mask. employees wearing either. grocery store employees wear masks anymore well. 

But vaccination rate really high, makes sense. problem - say need mask anymore safe, argue headline never full story. emotional variant story. üòè There's ton RSV going around -- get tested too? big cities, like Moscow, easily get inoculated relatively thoroughly tested Sputnik V, vaccination rates impressive also. Instead, people rush get untested EpiVacCorona CoviVac, less side effects. Asian countries time - maybe it‚Äôs time ‚Äúnew‚Äù normal.

Have talked doctor this? faking positive test gets self-isolating 10 days

Potentially switching cancer studies break genders females prone hormones related cancers tumors spayed current genetics, know. need lot females breast cancer type testing common diseases people too? definitely throw half lab rat supply nothing, females something them. 

And good thing take study like (rats supposed people tiny lifespans women estrus cycles, what's problem rats shorter ones exactly??) understand degree. studying genders separation mind still include both. Female rats definitely act way crazier, cycle puts craziness it. Males blobs comparison, behavioral study one inaccurate. Although think happens often health/drug studies, would slightly acceptable, would matter mostly things effected hormones physically, drugs health issues. always potential course. seems little backwards. Making changes matters most. surprised that. Last week number cases rose 10% driven increased mixing, travel, gatherings easing social restrictions,‚Äù said.

Buried deaths hospitalizations COVID-19 far less likely younger populations, Clayton Thury said *average hospitalization numbers* continue get younger. 

Actual CDC data: Hospitalizations declining Dakota data: also shows hospitalizations They're good disinformation they've managed disinform themselves. Impressive. wrong amazing media simultaneously profits early downplaying seriousness disease overhyping every single breakthrough case. vaccines work vaccinated safe. saying incorrect.

Your conclusion accurate, basically everything last paragraph inaccurate field use, Phizer vaccine shows 0.46% failure rate.

What's ""failure rate""? Googling Pfizer alongside number returns mostly stock numbers. Adding ""vaccine"" mix get anything relevant (the 0.46% pings random numbers efficacy related) aside I'm totally sure well translated. Pretty sure say 0.46%, meant say 46%. obviously number trying get at.

If guess, I'd say probably rudimentary calculation [breakthrough cases/total vaccinated]. Now, use CDC numbers way lower 0.46%, surprised wherever got number lost 0s along way.

Which brings next 10th advertised failure rate is.

Until know ""failure"" rate is, can't comparing [1-efficacy rate]. I'm willing bet large sums money, whatever 0.46% number using is, [1-efficacy people say 95% protection, remaining 5% considered failure, 90% asymptomatic person never even notice got infection.

This wholly inaccurate. 95% efficacy rate comparing symptomatic cases vs. symptomatic cases. Joe Placebo Group Steve Experimental Group close contact individual go COVID test come back positive, never develop symptoms, counted case. Different studies different definitions exactly constituted ""symptomatic COVID,"" top line number see refers reduction symptomatic COVID. ""fails"" 5% time, symptomatic cases. Could reduction death hospitilization? Sure, great data studies (due low N values placebo group), hard pull good data real world much bias gets introduced allowing people self sort vaccinated vs. unvaccinated. still get 2 shots, stay vigilant live life. anyone watch videos article? They're blatantly joking faking tests tiktoks, kinda like meme. One videos stacks bananas sorts top test, joke.

One speculate new coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) mutations variants might might arise regions, countries, locales coming hours, weeks, seasons, years, one thing arguably certain: one predict epidemiological future 100% certainty. IMO, medically eligible persons fully vaccinated get fully vaccinated ASAP. far anyone tell, yes. official numbers coming soon. Yeah? I've found pretty good. way I've informed state Covid. 

But definitely say good mention vast diversity different capabilities designs exhibited 'spacecraft,' assuming even 5% actually aliens. point masks keep people spreading Covid. vaccinated works better mask purpose. point was, beginning said 1 million, actually 1/55,000.

WTF kind question that? supposed stop people dying. 600,000 number compare thinking many people died vaccines.

What's guess deaths winter?

But judging two people running around picture see everything fine. Flags waving well. teaser Wheel Time came today. That's pretty new. Make easy changes like masks public transit indoor public spaces, vaccinating many possible, expanded testing, good likelihood R0 drops enough much else.


If things get worse, making changes elsewhere going happen. can, can, fewer changes need made elsewhere. CDC agrees too

Ok r/imthemaincharacter , mean agree CDC official North Korean news service released following (referring Kim Jong mentioned senior officials charge important state affairs neglected implementation important decisions Party taking organizational, institutional, material, scientific technological measures required prolonged state emergency epidemic prevention campaign associated worldwide health crisis, thus caused crucial case creating great crisis ensuring security state safety people entailed grave consequences.He analyzed strong terms major factor braking hindering implementation important tasks discussed decided Party congress plenary meetings Party lack ability irresponsibility cadres, called conducting fierce Party-wide campaign ideological faults sorts negative elements exposed among cadres.

L.A. got hit *really* hard Covid Dec-Jan (at peak 20k new cases hundreds deaths every day) lot us, kind hard shake.

Enjoy trip here! IIRC SAGE modelling data 40% increase transmissability Delta variant additional social distancing measures would peak higher case rate either previous two waves. would spite vaccinations. weak argument?

Do kids? High-risk family? Immuno-compromised friends family?

I read article day child get 4 limbs amputated due covid complications.

The vaccine available age range.

Now told think worth risk might bring home virus unknowingly I'm vaccinated, child could, potentially, end limbs cut off, masks make whine, Im pretty sure I'd tell stick mentality. biggest reason people hesitant felt rushed. actually took 50 years make vaccine.  guess cautious. perhaps data suggest ~ 25% unvaxed communites vunrable. Poor rural whites poor urban black lantinx communites make lot unvaxed USA. Still think wise point back CDC said vaxed need wear mask, not. 48 effective, like football team. infectious incubation period, even know yet. consequences actions. people actively refused vaccine knowingly spread virus always get care, billed individually. Period. want bluff worldwide pandemic pay dearly. sure schools breaking affect it.

My personal suspicion time get mid-July schools single largest factor spread Covid. look data around Easter impact school closures reasonably evident (case rates flatlined weeks prior able start falling again) seems actually want get good information out, produce viral sounds bytes. 

It's refreshing accurate.  recent party Sydney almost every unvaccinated person infected, people least one shot vaccine remain uninfected (at time).

It's protect access whatever reason refused chance shots. made clear asking fully vaxed Angelenos bend backwards ""sacrifice"" convenience health &amp; safety minority communities.

Masking goodwill gesture measure affords substantive protection who've already gotten shots. asking us charitable ppl who're laggards idiots. think Angelenos comply summer, public's patience going wear thin.  Long covid cases appear last longer bad cases non-covid induced pneumonia. Plus, numbers high enough justify continued mask mandates.

It scientifically insignificant, though. Child mortality hospitalization covid lower flu.

There vaccine chicken pox, though. people wear masks around chicken pox. Hell, 2000s vaccine parents forced kids get it. (Not saying best way this) Classic reporting true facts way totally misleads.

But headline ""an increase younger hospitalizations"" factually true. say something like ""an increase *the proportion* younger hospitalizations."" That's different. Small clinically significant.

Like say, yes, symptoms massively reduced get it, chances getting virus also massively reduced miniscule. consider driving night very/extremely safe modern cars working lights, airbags, etc. 

But don‚Äôt consider risk-free therefore ‚Äúsafe‚Äù requiring additional precautions vs driving day. Everything else equal.

Risk-free somewhat reminds 0 degrees Kelvin. Mostly fiction serves useful metric. Thanks! really, mostly referred heart inflammation lasting effects half expected stay mum. logical measured response. Precautions. evidence suggest heavily impact vaccinated  Plenty people caught covid vaccinated.

The vaccine 100%, one said was. could work home rest life. need see dumbasses again. thanks Yep, fun. However way look I'm pretty accustomed accepting things 'cannot be' point bad continued shut-in is, least something almost certainly end something new that's forever gone.

For anti-vaxers reading this, yes extension people like u/Avarria587's friend directly fault you. We're vaccinated, real idea effective us CDC says fine go unmasked people like us. States throwing away doses take them. DIRECTLY responsible keeping people like us shut homes.  infection, yes immunity bodies makes antibodies. We‚Äôre many people, 17 million, think it‚Äôs quite alright half million donated don‚Äôt millions vaccines laying around. It‚Äôs recently (maybe month) vaccines people, past months we‚Äôve continuous shortage promised deliveries never arrived halved amounts, AstraZenica stopped risks, didn‚Äôt enough. We‚Äôre soon reaching total amount people receiving first shot, kids included, done I‚Äôm certain donate extra‚Äôs, least said hope fullfill promise. hope countries (some already donated millions dope).

Not saying couldn‚Äôt more. agree. way. dominant July. worry tests get hands on. national debt imaginary point. Tell debt affected taxes all? ‚ÄúHate school? problem. Follow simple steps.‚Äù YMMV. I'm young woman hardly felt anything second Pfizer dose.  that's fine all, still used fake meme.

Hell sub still getting brigaded last week masks work crowd.

Happy Canada Day!!! know people currently undergoing chemo can't get vaxxed people anti-rejection medication organ transplant often build immunity vaccination. Hi thanks posting getting Moderna tomorrow AZ first AZ way harsh me. hoping Moderna little kinder.

Smart study actually quantifies reduced negative impact infection risk. Abstract

A novel variant concern (VOC) named CAL.20C (B.1.427/B.1.429), originally detected California, carries spike glycoprotein mutations S13I signal peptide, W152C N-terminal domain (NTD), L452R receptor-binding domain (RBD). Plasma individuals vaccinated Wuhan-1 isolate-based mRNA vaccine convalescent individuals exhibited neutralizing titers, reduced 2-3.5 fold B.1.427/B.1.429 variant relative wildtype pseudoviruses. L452R mutation reduced neutralizing activity 14 34 RBD-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). S13I W152C mutations resulted total loss neutralization 10 10 NTD-specific mAbs since NTD antigenic supersite remodeled shift signal peptide cleavage site formation new disulphide bond, revealed mass spectrometry structural studies.

What strongly disagree removal risk. Kid gets hurt playing dodgeball? Ban dodgeball, right? Kid gets hurt Bunsen burner? Ban Bunsen burners, right? Kid puts dry ice bottle makes big noise? Ban dry ice, right?

Sure, fewer future accidents. also lower engagement less learning. end less healthy people less developed problem solving skills.

I can't even buy decent chemistry set kids without building myself.

We idea need remove risk kids' lives. point people trying get rid bullying, Quixotic adventure I've ever seen one! Apparently requires standard freezer refrigeration temperatures stored. mailing option. need medical staff administer like vaccine injected needle.

It could something pick pharmacy, take home give family members. could spray noses themself parents could administer children home. Critical context: made condition offenders said vaccinated simply due procrastination. appears violated one's rights, least still medical decision judge say in. top arguments bodily autonomy, also potentially dangerous. people flat can't vaccinated medical conditions, individual's doctor determine that, government mandates.  dipped Guinness first. know, could million infected people still hospitalizations. 

What called fearmongering.  Bro im mexico going NYC soon, ask negative test flight. Another proof biden trump without twitter jokes. What, wave potential infect far people? It‚Äôs common sense. Delta variant far transmissible society opened up.

Hospital admissions increasing fact, prediction. vote want, know makes uncomfortable reading. don‚Äôt become complacent. Thank you! That‚Äôs excellent advice. US's daily vaccination rates fallen they're still hovering around 1MM doses day, aggravating still promising they'll get eventually. Delta variant showcase resilience across country. Northeast, example, already 70% vaccinated ages 12 above.  Australia bet house Astra Zeneca local production. announced suitable people &lt; 60. made &lt; 50. baby boomers figured probably unsafe-ish take it. there's enough pfizer imports age bracket. Weirdly enough, I‚Äôm finding much way official updates that. educated guess spread dropped enough it‚Äôs taking longer collect enough data. I‚Äôm sure lack solid updates J&amp;J frustrating people got one. someone happily vaccinated think bullshit personally. stop? go prisons force incarcerated get vaccinated too? house. 

I (male) got Moderna supposed side effects average phizer mildly sore arm dosage. 

My wife got Phizer nausea, fever rest common symptoms doses. Thats unconfirmed prediction. distance also time. could millions advanced civilizations around millions years still might missed **a billion years**. able look deep space for, what, couple hundred years? 


The odds two advanced species alive moment time seems infinitesimally small.  seem kind obsessed people still choosing wear mask whatever reason choose... That‚Äôs cool work data, too. model, it‚Äôs variables, fine there‚Äôs reason serious epidemiologists people like Mark Lipsitch don‚Äôt consider IMHE data something used policy. There‚Äôs also reason isn‚Äôt used anything ‚Äúmaybe there‚Äôs deaths‚Ä¶here‚Äôs one potential amount‚Äù. 

What sources arrive similar conclusions? interested seeing others calculating this, IMHE large amounts throughout pandemic (to fair, models models reason). don‚Äôt pay much attention models anymore various reasons (inaccuracies one), love seeing data others work it. late 2000s middle school huge issue bomb threats fake fire alarms. Humans disappointing. Probably. Infection mediated immunity harder predict. Vaccines target one surface protein, spike, variants common. (And without which, can‚Äôt even infect humans.) ones, immune system may made antibodies immune memory number those, might helpful, not, might decreased reaction spike. There‚Äôs easy way know sure much getting infected boosted immunity, it‚Äôs almost surely zero, yeah, you‚Äôre immune, without fairly extensive testing, nobody knows exactly much specific case. 

I hope you‚Äôre feeling better! point, I‚Äôd repurpose Curevac production sites make other, effective mRNA vaccines. production process relatively similar know good Pfizer Moderna works! People wanting isolate is/was already happening. test, case, irrelevant. I'm sure could fake negative test, positive basically find whatever makes test react. test react easy, take test. point a) willing take therefore, would fake b) forced show proof, means rapid test useless anyway, much chances false negative first place. Good effing luck They're glancing many places know less half eligible people vaccinated, yet less 1/10 wearing masks. Places low vaccination numbers get noticeable spikes.  Especially heat increasingly pushes inside. rest follow come fall cold pushes inside well.  fact it‚Äôs preventable point sad. 

I literally took 95year old neighbor ER found isn‚Äôt vaccinated there‚Äôs enough research trusts BS family feeds him.  desperately trying get lifesaving operation brain problem he‚Äôs developing yet instructed take vaccine options.

We found large proportion survivors COVID-19 cohort persistent symptoms 6 months initial illness. Although previously reported patients hospitalized severe COVID-19 frequently suffer long-term symptoms20,21,22,23, found half home-isolated, mildly moderately ill patients COVID-19 still suffered symptoms 6 months infection. worrying non-hospitalized, young people (16‚Äì30 years old) suffer potentially severe symptoms, concentration memory problems, dyspnea fatigue, half year infection. Particularly students, symptoms might interfere learning study progress.


Sixty-one percent (189/312) total patient population persistent symptoms 6 months initial COVID-19 illness, common symptoms fatigue (37%), difficulty concentrating (26%), disturbed smell and/or taste (25%), memory problems (24%) dyspnea (21%). Whereas frequency symptoms increased age study population, disturbed smell and/or taste frequent people younger 46 years old (Table 2). sounds like you‚Äôre scared wearing mask enough fight people internet üòâ

Be well kind internet stranger I'm conservative two science-related college degrees took virus seriously almost anyone knew early days. staying home wearing mask well mask mandates. attitude changed significantly death rate thought dropped around 0.5% became clear doctors medical professionals speaking narrative lockdowns effective necessary censored. media show sides story would listen it? media would attack gatherings one purpose unsafe similar gatherings purposes.

This Delta variant actually worrisome, appears significantly easily transmitted.

Ministers plan quarantine-free travel double-vaccinated

There cross-government push reopen foreign travel time give families chance book holiday abroad

JONATHAN BORG/ALAMY

Ministers aiming introduce quarantine-free travel double-vaccinated holidaymakers July 26, first full week school holidays, Times learnt.
The plans exempt people two doses Covid vaccine need quarantine amber-list countries, would open travel Europe, phased in.
At first relaxation would apply UK residents access NHS deal extend citizens European Union close signed.

UK ambassadors Europe also told make lobbying lifting restrictions British holidaymakers priority green list expanded month.
It part cross-government push reopen foreign travel time give families chance book holiday abroad 16 months coronavirus restrictions. ‚ÄúThe big focus us Europe now,‚Äù government source said. ‚ÄúAll European ambassadors told go lobby.‚Äù

However, several operational obstacles could delay plans. Home Office yet decided whether verification Covid certification take place passengers travel, border control, via spot checks officials moment checking people supposed quarantining.
Vision Box, company operates UK‚Äôs e-passport gates, said technology ready scan vaccination certificates UK EU.
Mitul Ruparelia, vice-president Vision Box, told Times Britain ‚Äúleading digitalisation‚Äù coronavirus paperwork, Home Office yet given firm go-ahead enable e-gates check vaccine passports.

He said: ‚ÄúWe confident using Vision Box platform checks easily enabled e-gates deal future threat pandemic country.‚Äù
The UK close agreeing deal Brussels ensure British holidaymakers use NHS app prove double-jabbed.

Under mutual recognition arrangement, EU countries would recognise NHS app vaccine certificate, UK would recognise EU‚Äôs digital green card. app would also prove travellers‚Äô Covid status testing, enabling go countries allow quarantine-free travel condition negative PCR test, Spain.

At present UK government co-ordinate individual countries chosen accept NHS app vaccine certificate.

Boris Johnson also push Germany relax rules UK travellers meets Angela Merkel Chequers tomorrow. Germany bans arrivals UK, travel forced quarantine 14 days exemptions.

Southern European states Spain, heavily reliant British tourists, already pushed back Merkel‚Äôs plans blanket EU-wide quarantine UK arrivals.
However, prospects travel reopened UK United States summer appear less positive. Grant Shapps, transport secretary, said problems devising vaccine certificate travellers countries US digitised system recognise vaccine types.

‚ÄúThe US recognise AstraZeneca, AstraZeneca hasn‚Äôt applied licence,‚Äù said.

‚ÄúOn side don‚Äôt particular system recognise vaccine status United States don‚Äôt digitised system. 50 separate systems.‚Äù
Government sources said Sajid Javid‚Äôs appointment health secretary brought forward government‚Äôs target date introducing quarantine-free travel vaccinated travellers.
A minister said: ‚ÄúThe intention place first week summer holidays.‚Äù

Another Conservative MP said: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre basing quite lot hope Sajid Javid, think return government make big change government‚Äôs approach international travel.‚Äù

A senior government source said: ‚ÄúNo final decision made timing yet. various issues need worked waiting public health advice exemptions operational factors.

‚ÄúThose need worked set details expectation end July beginning August.‚Äù Pfizer. Second dose February. 

Fever, body aches, fatigue, cough, sore throat, strength, headache, loss appetite, confusion, dizziness. Still test/smell.

If sound absurd hey go right ahead keep wearing mask forever, keep isolated.

I accept risks, expect people world except risks. scared stay home forever.

So directly answer question worth adopt absurd precautions protect risks tiny compared everyday rests accept.


But hey, semi-free country, need Sorry you‚Äôre looking correctly, amount unvaccinated people minuscule compared population countries like India.

You‚Äôre correct.

There many ways could accidentally it.

Just fun.

I wonder people would saying CDC said ‚Äúit‚Äôs decide whether want wear mask‚Äù.

Would give reasons say ‚Äúthe cdc said decision‚Äù, I‚Äôm willing bet lot reasons would sound lot like reasons antivaxxers antimaskers would use. know countries accept output, (all?)

One non-noted part regulations equate user behaviour - look MO right - mask wearing pretty much nil month ago, upsurge - even though new regulation brought biggest metro area Sweden (Stockholm) good deal denser Oslo Helsinki. top that, Sweden's overall population density (25) close Finland (18) Norway (15), also closer countries way worse Sweden like Bulgaria (64) Bosnia (64), Italy (206) U.K. (281).

Sure, (talking Stockholm) start comparisons similar cities. also factor overall health more, since know physical fitness correlated death too.

You can't apply broad strokes convenient. symptoms vaccine get? Forgot add this: don‚Äôt need justify position even though here. Why, that‚Äôs democracy works. try convince people debate. It‚Äôs simple one us holds moral high ground. want wear mask, that‚Äôs great there‚Äôs always risk

How much accept choice. much accept mine. much accept country choice overall country accepts risk matter who‚Äôs power gonna discredit RIVM based whether call fourth fifth golf, pedantic. missing point deliberately avoiding reasoning. ever question when.   Yes vaccines work! Kinda makes wonder turned 20million doses Pfizer offered last year tho. eggs one basket great strategy...  People seemed forgotten goal lockdowns measures were.. prevent hospitals overwhelming respect accepting Tenants' political personal beliefs. However, Tenant's behavior impacts business Tenants (driving away customers building) creates potential liability (e.g. large fines building owner ultimately responsible conflict community could translate physical altercations), becomes business decision whether continue Tenancy. ... Hours spent discussing Chris Castleman members Mendocino community became clear feedback best interest leave. respect Chris, repeat intense negative feedback heard community strong advice needed leave ASAP.¬†

Ah simple market forces regulating guy. dose Pfizer‚Äôs contains 30 micrograms vaccine. Moderna went much larger dose vaccine, 100 micrograms. means company using little three times much vaccine per person Pfizer is. yet, aren‚Äôt getting better results. government‚Äôs vaccine development program, formerly called Operation Warp Speed, asked Moderna test could lower dosage vaccine without eroding vaccine‚Äôs protection. vaccines effective it, much.

If variant actually transmissible, breakthrough infections spread mainly unvaccinated people increase odds exposure vaccinated people, that's it. 

We also know rare cases vaccinated people get breakthrough Delta, well variant terms prevention hospitalization serious disease. Bullshit, Saint Louisans smart got vaccinated, idiot delta carrying anti-Vaxxers getting sent spread disease here?  Again? I‚Äôm still wearing mine. definitely going past 50K cases day. thing that's really stopped sort rise past serious measures likely become untenable. Instead going back lockdown (which think do, would inevitable result curve like pre-vaccine), UK opening back July 19th.

What's going interesting seeing deal it. predictions:

1. Increased pressure vaccinate private sector. companies require workers get vaccinated require customers. d

2. Increased masking, potentially return mandates.

3. Anti-vaxxers getting even weirder.

4. winter worse.

5. Lockdowns hospitals begin getting seriously overwhelmed, even then, less harsh prior ones. Moderna here. Can't move arm 2 days. regret. Colombia find bunch uncounted deaths? They‚Äôre 106K, didn‚Äôt see idea anyone planet cares fake internet points like downvoting. still don‚Äôt get people using cases metrics places vaccination well underway.

From understand, covid likely continue exist, vaccines won‚Äôt make cases go zero, make deaths hospital admission close zero.

And numbers prove working that. people focus much number cases? Ah fuck - Resonance Covid Scenario.....it Xen along... Somewhat unfortunately UK using AZ vaccine good, great, preventing symptomatic infection individuals. 

They‚Äôve approved many different vaccines it‚Äôs understanding majority shots AZ unless I‚Äôm wrong. done wearing masks. I‚Äôve vaccinated. Sorry. Maybe two opening pitches, too, instead one, huh?  Canada says hi 77% one dose vaccinated ages 12+  Thank saying this. surprised article highlight two people indoor space, mall, presumably much longer ten seconds. know spread aerosols, droplets; specific moment passing matters. considering entire population? there‚Äôs 0-11 age gap still can‚Äôt take vaccine.

What makes sadder there‚Äôs probably kids 12-17 want take vaccine, parents won‚Äôt let them.  dunno, maybe might want help protect elderly, immunocompromised otherwise-vulnerable people around potentially deadly disease Wanna throw Brazil too. rough start January, finally least 1 million per day we‚Äôve got almost 50% adults one dose! cities vaccinating around 40-30 age range right think.

We likely vaccinate entire adult population least one dose august/September.I think Christmas we‚Äôll entire 12+ population fully vaxxed. Well sounds right none vaccines 100% effective created prevent severe disease, prevent general infection. Sorry brother wife though. Wishing speedy recovery :) UK currently Pfizer delivery constrained that's 40s get around 1.3M week, that's 1st 2nd doses. keep case vaccine hesitancy kicks in, one's sure level foreign holidays recently requiring fully vaccinated avoid 14 day quarantine (Portugal) Ireland limiting inside hospitality fully vaccinated people bother covid able holiday sun, they're inconvenienced getting vaccinated. Sadly, no. communities already swarming Covid yet ‚Äúliving normal.‚Äù think us civic duty protect chumps. 

You find people hesitant fence, lot lazy/apathetic busy people, actual antivaxers mostly unreachable. CDC like make decisions without published data back up. result really slow updating recommendations. compound problem, problem J&amp;J use widely vaccines Delta variant prevalent (yet!). data Delta variant coming UK robust variant disease surveillance system primarily use AZ Pfizer. result hard science make recommendations.


That said, lot circumstantial evidence suggest J&amp;J folks get booster see people die vaccinated J&amp;J CDC going slow make recommendations.  Man thought r/boburnham second! Inside masterpiece! there‚Äôs chance restaurant Woodland Hills tourists ‚Äúto-do‚Äù list links that?  probably order avoid violating others patents. think backwards. think Moderna one uses less.  Flu plus headache brain-fog. smallest task torture take care 4 yr old 1 yr old. Ah see. makes sense. I've hospital number times recall seeing facemasks sure work hard behind scenes. sucks enough wearing mask lab PPE day experience imagine pretty damn taxing wearing N95 day. wear working certain chemicals.

Thank hope stay healthy. Better look behind backpedaling Excess deaths well normal. Harvesting effect within natural bounds excess deaths.

If even going acknowledge get basic facts wrong, there's point continuing conversation. Take care get vaccinated. following Bahrain UAE  fine? sound like asshole. approve already goddamn. Yeah using since last year. Kind like viewed people skeptical 1st gen mrna vaccines anti vaxxer trump racists. Welcome club. powers caffeine motrin, back feeling 100% 11am. Definitely groggy wake though. valley ton great restaurants tbf take downvoting personally, people read daily thread want pretend pandemic honest questions COVID risk annoy them, still mystery...

But question, put number it, vaccinated reduces risk spreading least 550,000 residential households UK January March 2021, overall SARS-CoV-2 secondary attack rate 5.7% household index case received least one dose Oxford-AstraZeneca 6.3% households index case received Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine 21 days testing positive. contrast, overall secondary attack rate households unvaccinated index cases may still want consider masking sensitive situations (given risk tolerance), like around highly vulnerable individuals (elderly, immune-compromised,etc.). Actually wrong since indicates 60% Delta positive vaccinated fully percent drops closer 40% symptoms. Using logic pay people get heart disease diet. can't deny people treatment put bankruptcy medical issue. That's immoral. Makes sense. also wear everywhere except outside lunch breaks. Also thank do. read replies here, definitive say implying causation known fact. clue caused it, even cause figure out. saying - ‚ÄúHey, got mRNA vaccine also experienced heart issues receiving it.‚Äù factual statement.

Vaccinated visitors overseas exempt 14-day quarantine starting week Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Good question. I'll wear mask sure go.

This kind wake call. family (wife kids) havn't close contact COVID positive person whole ordeal. We've vaccinated since March let guard mask first time...nof course happens. think child wear mask congested areas seen prudent precaution. Better feel bit silly remorseful fall ill, think. Serves right!  Yeah probably, hope make stockpile doses wasted Even link, blue bars still go orange average since February. There's ""way baseline"" unless talking exactly June, case text pretty Data incomplete lag time death occurred death certificate completed, submitted NCHS processed reporting purposes. delay range 1 week 8 weeks more, depending jurisdiction cause death. working improved vaccine. Dead last vaccination rates western world. 

Why so? That's works. weird impacts people differently! first shot (AZ) fever, aching, chills, really tired. Second one (Moderna) chills bit bad first time around, super exhausted. 

Someone else know wiped second one, though. got vaccine weekend still felt kinda rough today. Probably best ask medical professional thought please, decide go, love all, wear mask! people plane you‚Ä¶  link? reasoning claim? k-12 colleges too? Miopic we? Ya, wonder future vaccine technology.

From understand live attenuated vaccines induce robust immune response, often lifetime immunity. also carry risk people comorbidities, risk reversion deadly strain. risks eliminated genetically engineering virus using ""codon deoptimization"", seems like would ultimate vaccine technology. vaccinated sick probably one dose. give everyone ivermectin call day. It‚Äôll wiped couple weeks. I'm sure understand question vaccines cause mycarditis. Poor countries would get AZ then. efficacy rate low, cost production high justify price.  spare time pandemic? Yes using Pfizer Moderna vaccines mostly Pfizer. AZ mostly used 50s. Definitely, everyone knows monies means higher prevalence delayed gratification adolescents.  Ahhh, yep. makes sense. lot pranks dumb shit much easier get away back then.  fucking love kids.

They figure way make *everything* worse lol.  bother whinging internet people choosing ""do them"" framing issue terms false binaries? amazing read! ‚Äúone done‚Äù husband keen getting booster time soon(I know, know) reassuring. Oh yeah! remember false HIV positives now. Lord. happened America would set vaccine update back even further. hope incident hasn‚Äôt made anyone resistant vaccines arrive mass  ended working them? Alright well let walk basic math get percentage using data. Go ahead google # covid deaths divide # covid positive cases.

For US it'd 33.6 million cases 604k deaths sooo
604,000 √∑ 33,600,000 = 0.0179 

Let's look numbers Washington state epicenter whole thing: 454,000 cases 5984 deaths
5984 √∑ 454,000 = 0.013

Multiple numbers 100 turn percentage:
Washington 1.31% covid mortality rate (or 98.69% survival rate) USA 1.79% covid mortality rate (or 98.21% survival rate)

If averaged covid survival rates linked earlier averaged 98.51% survival rate pretty much percentages obtained raw numbers.

Again, quit fearmongering. never attack besmirch anyone wearing mask, likely reasons they‚Äôre hurting anyone. That‚Äôs fine. problem ‚Äúwear masks long exists risk whatsoever‚Äù proponents pontificate moral judgements (vaccinated) individuals decided stop wearing masks. reject notion (and I‚Äôm saying you‚Äôre saying this) it‚Äôs somehow irresponsible, reckless, inconsiderate someone everything power times maximally reduce risk everyone around them. think that‚Äôs absurd impossible standard live by. Europe, Latvia JJ folks: data gather delta spreads. want find happens, means part data set. 

But info tells aren‚Äôt enough people find quickly. 

If you, I‚Äôd take rMNA vaccine can. I‚Äôve even heard people‚Äôs doctors recommending rMNA shot sure. seems also choose accept EU COVID certificate, like Germany would've made almost amount extra unemployment making working hospital üôÉ undisclosed document anonymous official part former US president Donald Trump‚Äôs administration, suggesting three WIV researchers sick November 2019.‚Äô could pandemic-related, not.

Iraq's ""weapon mass destruction"", anyone? Likewise, I'm nurse, busier ever üôÉ Classic reporting true facts way totally misleads.

Average age hospitalized COVID patients declining: Panik


Number older patients hospitalized decreasing faster rate younger patients likely due higher vaccination rates: Kalm anyone actually use it? scenario? answer, course, possible. answer next question enough data know. worker, got furlough. Sure, wasn‚Äôt risky supermarket work, workload probably tripled supporting staff‚Äôs work home arrangements Super Saiyen Delta Plus Ultra Limit-Break Covid: Final Match Edition trying revive western front? important US western countries general China somehow pinned arch villain Covid pandemic . fits anti-china agenda take incompetent government hook. shit would put independent? newspaper read school.  Apparently papaya fool covid Yup, like airplanes. Empty seats/beds make money. Yay for-profit healthcare... nickname, stereotype Irish people slow phrase given. quote given trying shame Ireland action.

And Ireland risk British residents (6m EU passport holders) using stepping stone to/from continental Europe. I'm going concede point Pfizer study. known better go personal anecdote. friend mine federal law enforcement part first Phizer study groups. Perhaps bi-weekly testing due employment, Pfizer study.

My meta point think stand. analysis infection rate etcetera etcetera tendency make people think vaccine ineffective bother. 

It's beyond frustrating trying get friends relatives get vaccinated, counters really work, course gross inflation quote vaccine injury.

I live one highly intellectual towns United States, vaccination rate seems stalled 89%.

When ask people rarely claim vaccine injury, mostly false claim really work. governor, despite CDC guidance decided much restrictive, leading idea vaccine changes nothing. country? like article includes suggested ways manipulating test thought busy?

You're gaslighting me. trying... failing. would think since British citizen, you‚Äôd better grasp English language.

Anyhow, really done, fun believing sun shines purely you! Ah yeah strictly referring go hospital Covid case Children likely get severe symptoms get infected.  Q: Given coronavirus research places done BSL-2 BSL-3
labs--and indeed, WIV even operational BSL-4 recently--
why would coronavirus experiments BSL-4 coronavirus research laboratory conducted BSL-2 BSL-3
laboratories. necessarily safety protocols themselves. Everything takes several times longer higher BSL ratings. decided cut corners. BSL2 level safety dentist's office. Would anyone else surprised caught COVID dentist? take away get covid need stay away pets much possible, humans. 

When covid scare wife isolate waited PCR testing, dog stayed room me. mostly didn‚Äôt want conduit via dog‚Äôs fur, see consider dog‚Äôs health too. paid *extra* nothing, also increased government debt crazier levels ever, we'll paying long term well. Ahh, knives out. wonder Tony Abbott days... get tested? often wonder people go get tested symptoms mild. EU threaten Pfizer export ban.

The EU introduced export controls see going why. announed would block exports manufacturers exporting time fulfilling EU contracts (mainly aimed Astrazeneca).

With exception plant restructuring process early (two three weeks) Pfizer deliveries never late little. whole process affect Pfizer all.

The EU exported way 200 million doses vaccine far. us camp. enjoyed couple months grocery shopping (early mask on) going back hiding. I'm vaccinated real data understand much really going work. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now I'm fortunate able afford delivery job allows work home 100% time. I'm often person store (when went) still masked wear headphones ignore people making snide comments walk by. people really understand impacts us general, I'm OK it. go they'll still hopelessly stupid. Oh can't follow convo thread, understand. speed Alpha drove classic strain absurd. Delta drives Alpha even faster. actually pretty bizarre - since Delta entered UK, alpha cases dropped 2000/day maybe 100/day, delta import levels 10k+/day. There's credible mechanic directly compete: we're seeing alpha quickly destroyed limited vaccinations NPI's delta much less affected. seen essentially every country sequencing Delta presence.

Most lineages (VOC's) tier Alpha, maybe one two par it. Gamma tier alpha, maybe able compete Delta - least, can't tell sure it'll driven way. really seems like VOC's longer even relevant, Delta maybe Gamma cases matter now. This! continue work. hazard pay. Risking life barely cover expenses. Meanwhile people allowed stay home get paid nothing. fair throw money it. Pretty sure NK get plenty sinovac whatever Chinese vaccines want them, free probably. problem whether NK personel infrastructure administer 30 million people. Children don‚Äôt need worry covid. Read article NPR help better understand inflated risk perception referencing ‚Äòa whole lot people‚Äô. could part ‚Äòwhole lot people‚Äô, self-centered ‚Äòworld revolves around them‚Äô mindset describing applies you‚Ä¶ since seem want spotlight much, replies, I‚Äôm leaning direction does. 

Now you‚Äôll pardon me, important work many people rely on, takes precedence silly conversation.  sure. It‚Äôs necessarily indicator good health. lost weight he‚Äôs cutting calories, great. myriad health conditions cause weight loss, good (for him). you.

I admit need run every single day. that's risk analysis defect, know risk much higher heart disease, yet exercise sufficiently. So....self grounding? idea bad misinformation coming country is. said reminded keep forgetting kids &lt;12. Brazil starting see lot children dying (presumably D). ammonia plus bleach. Got it. information regarding Johnson &amp; Johnson (finally) delta variant. 

- Phase 3B - 400,000 healthcare workers
- published # breakthrough cases: 94% mild, 4% moderate, 2% severe
- Claims new lab/antibody studies show time immune responses induced JnJ vaccine matures covers variants concern Beta Delta variants.

In sum data press release suggests boosters necessary J&amp;J vaccine point Delta variant. 

Also, used fully vaccinated status 28 days, 2 weeks US using.

I wish able tag post J&amp;J vaccine news since lot us waiting information! honest, man use losing weight. probably around 100KG 5'6 frame. live Romania. get done private clinics fee, much. Covid-19 Spike protein antibody test. 

We wanted 100% sure immune response vaccine travelling abroad holiday spending time resort thousands people. 

Unless done clinic procedures, reactive agents measuring units results 1:1 comparable. think inability deliver type sincerity. learned Bill important reach kids (I remember playing Sax Nickelodean kid thinking badass), couldnt pull like could. massive penalties too, got caught, much easier get caught less surveillance network. bomb threats got popular right 9/11, like covid now, cancel immediately, figure later. false article? heart goes legitimate medical conditions make unable get vaccinated, immunocompromised, young kids, breakthrough infections, etc. 

For simply refuse vaccine get infected, zero sympathy point. getting asked for. draining healthcare resources stressing medical staff reason. live Portland, area went trip Branson week (I'm Nixa, MO). family literally people wearing masks everywhere went except occasional server restaurant. near Portland, rare see people wearing masks. absolutely incredible. need evidence TikTok bad idea?  army Russian hookers

who specialized peeing? run mile also wear mask grocery store public transit? things mutually exclusive.  10 celebrities got Covid Delta Plus (You wont believe #7) Comparing Sweden neighboring Scanadanvian countries done simply due geographical convenience, similar terms things mentioned.

Yes, Norway Finland similar terms nationwide population density. similar terms relatively high-density metro center bad luck hit heavily early pandemic. understand see fit remove variables (including countries fared far worse Sweden, like mentioned, much closer Scandinavian pop. density ""main"" EU countries) this.

I looked deeply factors like diet, health, hospital infrastructure, Sweden, Norway, Finland really detached rest Europe three countries compared other? eyeballing average national BMI Wikipedia, looks like basically EU occupies narrow range.  Yes getting hit hard virus? 

I think getting hit ""so hard"". cases per capita NK probably still among lowest countries. 

However, take NK's broken economy consideration, even couple hundred cases could put awkard position--totally cramped medical systems, hardship get food everyone putting citizens hard-style lockdown, etc, etc.  agree give third shot.

The neutralizing blood tests refute this; tests still measuring antibody reactions. immunity great use; arguably main thing. Antibody levels decline even healthy immune systems, t-cell responses last longer. cd8 cells kill virus directly. cd4 t-cells direct body begin immune response. cells, disease severity lessened. here. blood sugar dropped right away felt like going sick. that, 0 symptoms. Found fellow Ontarian! country restrictions wish get vaccine. Can't go work, school, gym etc. without vaccine, imagine would help faking covid, getting sick recovering getting shot. scientific method. See works, another way making Elisa dye react. 

Personally going fake positive I'd drop bit ink appropriate spot. else could possibly referencing, given poster talking me, post clearly talking me?

I'm offended, think funny.  caught you, yes. days CCTV thousands public phone boxes city, would much harder work it. Trump said vaccines ready November right. great deal vaccine companies. Stop blaming Trump everything. vaccinated routinely tested infection.

This occur. [Here's Pfizer mention periodic routine testing COVID-19. 

Here's major point regarding counted ""Confirmed COVID-19"" Covid-19 defined according Food Drug Administration (FDA) criteria **presence least one following symptoms**: fever, new increased cough, new increased shortness breath, chills, new increased muscle pain, new loss taste smell, sore throat, diarrhea, vomiting, **combined respiratory specimen obtained symptomatic period within 4 days after** positive SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid amplification‚Äìbased testing, either central laboratory local testing facility (using protocol-defined acceptable test).

So like saying asymptomatic cases would count either arm study. needed both, symptoms positive real world, ~1/2% vaccinated ever turn medical setting symptoms.

This relatively large hedge. ""Turning medical setting"" different ""knowing it."" Many would ""silent infections"" would also ""turn medical setting."" Aside wife's positive test (which got precaution traveling), turn medical setting, either.

I mean, sure, defining ""failure rate"" ""needs go see doctor,"" sure, buy half percent, shit many age ranges, that's ""failure rate"" without vaccine. Truckloads people need see doctor infected. pandemic going ongoing, it‚Äôs going magically disappear. There‚Äôs far many unvaccinated people. vaccinated people least worries.

That's dumb, like say we're certain percentage vaccinated stop wearing masks Sounds great...if 1.5 YEARS really found bit odd J&amp;J came every liberal media outlet bending backwards stress compare efficacy Pfizer/Moderna. get comparison quite simple efficacy vs efficacy, articles bordering ""efficacy matter. shut take vaccine."" Also constantly comparing efficacy vs efficacy days variants?

Also now, clearly trial second J&amp;J dose failed right? guess they're never going tell us? suspect local jurisdictions bother. Also ones vaccine uptake low might least likely want anything. People concerns vaccines due legitimate health issues SMALL minority. point, vast majority unvaccinated adults States people taken pandemic seriously since day one.

Never caught covid unvaccinated, 2 months J&amp;J vaccine test positive yesterday. course vaccinated engaged ‚Äúless safe‚Äù aka normal behavior, shit luck. Anyone else still catch covid vaccinated? I‚Äôm sure like ‚ÄúPhuket, let‚Äôs reopen‚Äù damn wish leave house like two fuckin weeks straight solution Damn say maybe. even news Worthy? 
It's either yes offers protection no.
If answer no, need let people know make sure vaccinated Jansen, take alternative vaccine must agree. pretty alarmist.

By way, live Indonesia even though substantial spike here, actual evidence ground fairly thin driven Delta, media really wanting push angle since spike even started.

They found less 200 Delta cases Jakarta. didn‚Äôt say many sequenced, given many people infected there, doesn‚Äôt seem like high number. reported ‚Äú87% new variants Delta cases‚Äù focus percentage number sounds scary that‚Äôs actually particularly surprising even relevant number. One would expect new variants mostly Delta. 87% number doesn‚Äôt reflect percentage total infected, however I‚Äôm sure lot people drew conclusion. There‚Äôs lot kind reporting it‚Äôs maddening. 9 second rule!  dont WANT die. Whether like them, disagree otherwise. susceptibility conspiracy theories, refusal believe science unwillingness listen reason increase chances death. Whether variant another. Kids gonna kids. cannot help applaud efforts.   Envy world said look we‚Äôre are. Unfortunate timing outbreak. What's next? Intentionally getting covid miss class? could Pfizer they'd go get it.

I'm 17, go expensive school, spent summer interning NGO teach underprivileged children, seen sides. would rather self study go back school covid protocols went toss one month re-opened (not children, teachers too), plus, immunocompromised minors too, something ""children bad"" side seems forget, we're also basically adults, going spare us according logic. I'm also okay entrance exam coaching online reason.


I seen loss basic knowledge social skills underprivileged children, know everyone lucky enough mentored 2 months, would still send kid school one situation, worth risk. would rather focus improving online classes making sure children access it. example, NGO distributed 25,000 tablets among kids lower income areas able connect them. Alabama? many unvaccinated choice people still taking covid precautions? many think ""just flu"" entire pandemic overblown? Now, terms death, Sweden looks like average European country

There inherent problem - cannot compare group. 

The EU far dense, far travel coming (which helped disease spread).

A correct comparison would directly Scanadanavian neighbors due similar density, lifestyle, more. compared them, Sweden significantly worse. still spread people may mild cold-like symptoms? listened Israeli hypochondriac brigade think people dropping dead streets Yeah, still dont remember OK state.

Relying covid diagnosis reporting extremely unreliable.  political pressures report. Lack access tests (especially early on). Inconsistent requirements asserting covid cause death.  factors mean counting number reported deaths good way actually understand scope. 

So better understand actual numbers, need aggregate analyze data. link articles explain well, interested, Google it.

Vaccines generally work well immunocompromised people. people reddit made fun overly complex situations approvals red tape EU, never understood now. exact vaccine !!
Anyway good see major countries EU begun accept Covishield aka Oxford vaccine Probably countries. 

Even USA looks like absolute amount Delta cases still rising.

This means alpha case start see rise normal infection charts. Better nothing, sure.

I wish people would focus getting good fit. comfortable anyway always falling face. said, still better nothing stops majority mouth spray shot directly person talking to. Well one knows whether I‚Äôve vaccinated I‚Äôm considering well others. It‚Äôs objectively true wearing mask protect someone else unable unwilling get vaccinated. don‚Äôt need people see face much wearing mask inconvenient seems others.

Really makes feel good choice I‚Äôm making help protect others cannot make choice.

But yeah people said don‚Äôt wear mask tell people that.

When people ask wear one, I‚Äôm gonna say people world deal issues world isn‚Äôt made them.

Great question washing masks. wonder often people lying vaccinated? Gtf way see wild bunny peril... even get like started animals :) Yeah actually ill day Moderna one got Pfizer first too. I'd though want mess around getting full immunity delta variant could dominate weeks. seemed riskier wait Pfizer take Moderna Australian PM commit opening border Christmas 2022 interview. They've kind painted corner.  interesting! vaccine knocked two days (female), affect guys house. Great see still drop bucket. Western governments spent obscene amounts help people stay home stop spread protect healthcare infrastructure. cost vaccines world would small comparison. tried hard complain throughout pandemic I've easy live own, financially risk due pandemic able live comfortably it. I'm starting get selfish want everyone planet get offer vaccine want able visit family. People offered vaccine delay happening people refuse get vaccine putting possiblity risk. I'm selfish travel across three continents visit nephews nieces that's lot vaccine cost providing nations difficulty paying much context. Granted paucity vaccines difficulty distribution administration remains, wealthy nations step up. 5000 extra skymiles sign flight. I'm older 30, married, stable work [YOU KNOW], that's still preferred existence.  I'm sorry I'm going take introverted card. Delta Diamond Medallion? Same. frustrates people declare pandemic give fuck children. Whenever remind people pandemic still (especially discussing schools open parents forced back offices) I'm met absolute hate. People's feelings take common senses. eligible children get vaccine, pandemic fucking over. need us ever. Catching mild infection work bringing back unvaccinated children OK !! People calling shots understand this. see increasing apathy lately know two cases limited social circle last week - one vaccinated Pfizer, another J&amp;J. First guy sniffling continuously barely mask on. Second guy also mask on. Person 1 tests positive. Next day, person 2 tests positive. Thankfully hospitalized mild symptoms (loss taste smell) wonder would happen children? epsilon 1:5 chance symptomatic disease delta variant ~ 80% efficacy Pfizer/Moderna. That‚Äôs interesting statistic I'm sorry hear that.

Hopefully....HOPEFULLY...one day someone start looking big picture stand point, I'm you. isolated island country? typical.

Exactly. isolated mean virus spread mistaken. Tourism huge Cuba.
If one isolated island country sanctions USA well, rises uncomfortable question richer countries poorly? wear ffp2! motivated potential tourists going give pass night life venues still closed.  still wear mask. mom Cancer. 2 vaccinations. protected? Idk...  change/fund education systems kids see education empowering positive thing is, rather something avoid costs? 

Clearly people clever smart degree, let's use waste it. currently keeping night (two young kids, one immunocompromised)

You cannot get imunocompromised kid get vaccinated? sorry hear that.  overwhelmed order good contract tracing. It‚Äôs also linked stronger disease well Yes, that‚Äôs point. remains true even OC thinks ought true. they‚Äôre still intellectually emotionally immature teenagers. Slept better well, no, screen time night bae. people glance don‚Äôt wear mask even though vaccinated. end day, it‚Äôs choice people shouldn‚Äôt shame it

That said, science says people safe without masks. Also, many people actually clean masks? would really interesting statistic feel bad countries vaccine readily available. 

But US, everyone wanted vaccine already taken it, change go day. Wondering anybody knows aware sort update status J&amp;J 2 dose trial. single dose data came out, much chatter data 2 dose regimen would months away. Well, we‚Äôre months away. Anybody know problem? Cases low they‚Äôre testing it‚Äôs dragging? assume results sort we‚Äôd heard something (like CureVac). Thanks! can't stop spread without family reasonable risk could get COVID transmit kids even vaccinated. Vaccines reduce transmission, level imagine given protective vaccines health. Though honest, well impressive visualization transmission chains Singapore. Click ""vaccinated"" see many vaccinated people passed COVID people. kids stay home, I‚Äôd say fuck it. 

It‚Äôs students/kids education.

Just repeat extra year see still want stay home faking Covid‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. assure - least US, plenty vaccines - eligible adult still unvaccinated taking COVID precautions anymore (and likely never first place). reality currently keeping night (two young kids, one immunocompromised) think days __gone__ necessarily, think depend level threat personally okay with. 7% risk hospitalisation high you, yes correct. like think 7% okay, (which, mind you, guaranteed 7% - real world depend factors like age, comorbidities etc) still activities. important point is, covid hospitalisations overwhelm healthcare system, started locking first place. Especially effective therapeutics, coming years, risk miniscule.

So yes, basically said two comments ago. Im double vax-ed. 2nd shot received April  also got covid June. Unvaccinated BIL go hospital 4 days. me- zero symptoms. problems. still quarantined protect kids dumba$$e$. 

Vaccines dont keep getting this, make strong enough handle it.

I see keeping home drastic damaging I'm position pay nanny work day wife work. missing much. Yes, interaction children important, absolutely, come time. 

And offense taken, good points. Market forces = people making rational decisions. always questions also articles never address. suppose information wouldn‚Äôt generate much fear.  Recovering left hospital, yes. run track again, jury still out. vaccine cause heart issues also. 

To pedantic, cause myocarditis (inflammation heart muscle) peticarditis (inflammation lining around heart). grouped together heart inflammation it. directly cause heart damage inflammation.

The issue heart inflammation extremely strenuous exercise, strain exercise inflammed heart cause lasting damage. recommend light exercise week vaccination, case. week, inflammation would gone perfectly safe. unable things enjoy.

We appear building agreement. things enjoy requires crowded indoor space unmasked hundreds strangers movie theater, dining hall beer hall, ocean cruise, suspect day gone. activities carefree long time. Yes, still test positive covid vaccine. point keep hospital.  don‚Äôt know that. Super Mario 64 one best games time. fact preferred mode existence broad swath them. Forget asking. life. Wearing mask good idea Covid. don‚Äôt need anyone‚Äôs permission take care yourself. got mask ouija board it. decorate mask...maybe bedazzles though. Anyway...

This life don‚Äôt owe pricks explanation.  think little along link starts, could send also donate blood check antibodies. you, I‚Äôd get tested wait days planning gatherings. That‚Äôs though.

You probably don‚Äôt need disinfect though, surface transmission extremely rare long practice decent hygiene. Ryanair allowed openly racist, they're home country?

And maybe Ireland bit different position land border non-EU country. wouldn‚Äôt bring lot clicks, don‚Äôt talk that. media information exciting controversial Yes, relevant links megacomment yesterday. got Moderna doses 0 side effects either. idea totally fine. likely going get second test turn negative miss days only.

and anyways. Lots teens break quarantine rules going stop them? parents? Estimating efficacy based antibody neutralization data good look. remember synthesised chemical makes oranges smell like oranges, indeed, smelt like oranges.

Was ascorbic acid (vitamin C) something else? So, case would likely happened without vaccine. That's personally. people you, they're people. would rather stay respective homes attend respective schools, home school. Everyone? World exists outside rich countries recommending 3rd doses even perform antibody test. get drop head buried sand act, pretending everything great somehow protected undetectable ways? recovered yes? vaccine cause heart issues also CDC said ‚Äúit‚Äôs states decide‚Äù new mask guidance, states gonna get brunt Delta variant (due low vaccination rates) states won‚Äôt implement masks circumstances, states like New York Oregon high vaccination rates would double say masks till sometime 2022 precautionary measure. I'm seeing lot groupthink appeal authority which, science ""following science.""

This exactly I'm seeing pushing ivermectin. going long enough we're tired it.

You even engaged appeal authority emphasizing podcast people's credentials.

Check TWiV. worst. Im fully vaccinated, I'm terrified bringing virus back work - even though everyone im working fully vaccinated. I'm one still wears mask, hope I'm making mistake getting hell now.

It's sort surreal right now. Everyone else work discussing lives everything back normal - everything back normal them. know lucky are.  I've seen reason to. Coming end self isolation period (10 days) pretty nasty covid infection. 

Upon finishing 10th day isolation safe people visit house? could virus still alive surfaces? I‚Äôm going disinfect much possible chance lingering virus? ‚ÄúThis works vaccine efficacy 74% infection.‚Äù

If don‚Äôt mean either, feel free clarify I‚Äôll try answer people (unvaccinated vaccinated) come contact delta variant, there's higher likelihood mutation.

Vaccination mean can't asymptomatic carrier - selective pressure favors mutations get around antibodies keep infection check.

I‚Äôm making excuses wearing mask. I‚Äôm literally following CDC guidance. That‚Äôs excuse apply newborn, vaccinated, be, vaccine approved people age 12 yet? love seeing kind news. discoveries, formulate tests better. Beautiful. Good job kids. actually abuse it. Well talking 2020 here. talking situation present day kids finding unique way stay home school. 

Idk pretended sick fair amount high school absolutely loved basically taking day could. kids could fake covid test, even pretend like feel sick positive test doesnt necessarily mean symptoms, enjoy week half vacation.

That nothing lockdowns 2020 depression caused many people. disagree‚Ä¶ vaccines reduce risk, masks reduce risk. Masks cheap minor inconvenience - both? There‚Äôs still risk, it‚Äôs cheap easy wear mask might save life not? started booster studies several months ago, hopefully we‚Äôll see results Delta 2: Turbo

Delta 2: Championship Edition think hilarious anyone would lecture New Zealand cautious, they're one countries successfully controlled disease. notes Vietnam, Thailand, South Korea's COVID responses well? Correct wrong thought one variants infect fully vacinated people. Anyone know theres amy truth behind that? Oh, somehow know feel. Neat. simple way avoid increasing chance dying new delta variant. Go get vaccine. Perhaps wear mask socially distance. no, they've refused that. Hell, ones likely deny virus exists. current variant wreaking havoc people. I'm simply stating obvious. is, people continue ignore expert advice, people die. could eventually increase vaccination % 70% target. Somehow, twisted statement wanting sort genocide fools. probably don‚Äôt bud. I'm vaccinated like dogs value much highly people. vaccinated care anyone else, would absolutely motivation get vaccinated. I'm sorry üò¢ great lagging indicators. Hopefully get good chuckle expense come winter there‚Äôs high amounts morbidity mortality. I, personally, doubt will. 

Heart disease isn‚Äôt transmissible. grandma can‚Äôt catch car crash supermarket share family Sunday brunch. 

Again, wearing mask pretty simple. Asians time cold. wearing mask store saved someone‚Äôs life, would worth it? 

It would clear decision KNEW would save persons grandma dad. tough part knowing sure. 

But time, you‚Äôre vaccinated wearing mask might save potentially life altering health changes - especially new variants emerge. 

Last summer cases dropped without vaccine, we‚Äôre seeing similar drop. Time tell hope you‚Äôre right I‚Äôm wrong. I‚Äôm going wear mask me, family, community. I‚Äôm scared. don‚Äôt expect zero risk, simple thing reduces risk - not? Little punks RIVM going say fifth way coming saying fourth wave third? cannot even count four. 23 July get second shot. Till I'm going careful. think teens things time think consequences of. I'm sure lot thrilled school canceled spiraling depression isolated months. extra tests done doses exported UK semi-free country, you. Delta deadly Alpha

Even accept 20% severe cases lead long term effects (no studies done knowledge long term effects post-vaccinated delta variant cases) , severe cases long term effects.

To clear, 20% infections lead long term effects, 20% detected infections lead long term effects, 20% severe hospitalized cases un-vaccinated lead long term effects, that's alpha variant. 

Unless study Delta I'm unaware of?

Lets assume 20% \~4000 infection vaccination lead long term harm, 174 million vaccinated. That's rate 4.6/million. we'll multiply ratio efficacy rates vaccine vs alpha vs delta variants. Call factor 4.

So 18/million suffer long term injury infection Delta vaccination (a gross estimate, we'll go now)

The CDC stats \~300,000 people sustain permanent injury per year car accidents. 880/million/year. 

Get grip. 

Stop scaring yourself. healthy.

 ride car, accept risk, screw crap, get vaccinated, go live life. Sure, symptoms covid positive. think there's parent would make kid lay bed 10 days symptoms.   one PHE reports UK, saw across period month, number instances delta plus sequenced decreased ~50 ~10. 

Best data I've seen far it.  Gotcha, that's typing speaking style, sorry miscommunication  starting doubt teenager extracurricular activities, seems creative ideas channelised avoid homeschooling homework! likely tho. Majority quarantined never actually got infected I‚Äôve started wearing mask public spaces indoors. wrong people!? Get vaccinated accident. posted earlier deleted reposted minus one phrase got post removed incivility. going experience advised so. see... doesn‚Äôt seem like enough be‚Äùpretty sure‚Äù though tbh. depends upon individual's sex *and* age. 

My mother 77 rheumatoid arthritis (she gets flare-ups mention discussed vaccine side-effects me, troubling). Mom experienced side effects 1 dose Pfizer, second shot brought flareup arthritis, fever, fatigue course joint pain lasted week.

My brother, 54, side effects brief low grade fever overnight Pfizer 2nd dose. 

I 57, physically active female underlying conditions. 1st Moderna...nothing. 2nd dose: 12 hours - extreme pain shot arm, fatigue, low grade fever serious joint pain. lasted 24 hours, trailed mere injection site soreness. 

Surprising differently effects sexes age groups. think shot volume reflect this, *and* possibly underlying conditions. Gotcha, advised get matching manufacturer told important so. months ago, obviously days change hope everyone get vaccinated safely effectively Exactly. people don‚Äôt accept much risk others do. CDC accepts I. That‚Äôs it

There‚Äôs risk driving everyday yet people still it. Don‚Äôt live life fear - biggest thing fear fear itself. That‚Äôs perspective I'm eligible 1 million 2 million contests, daily $50,000 lotteries newly vaccinated seem enticing me. That's something like 1/10,000 chance compared 1/5 million. bad that's practically incentive holdouts.  submission linking yahoo.com automatically removed source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Nothing more, nothing less Thanks worries, curious see moment, still pretty dang low sadly. also every tailoring would lots testing. Exactly, even wear mask never zero risk. Yet somehow people head every time rise cases someone dies Covid, it‚Äôs time dawn masks reimpose restrictions. many things kill hurt yet everyone focused Covid masks

It‚Äôs like masks protector matter effective vaccine is, matter fact cases lower last year, matter many times virus mutates. I‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs simple people act like it‚Äôs piece cloth

It literally piece cloth nothing clearly simple antibodies = protection 100% true. See excerpt article below. read full article?

‚ÄúHowever, physician-scientists stressed immune system tools antibodies disposal, including T-cells immune cells, may provide level immunity. So, concerning someone gets negative antibody test, still possible immune system fight virus, even vaccination produce antibodies, Mellors said.‚Äù Delta plus Quatro envigorating Shae butter Well could go forever. instead I‚Äôll use use antivaxx friends family.

‚ÄúYou know might right. hadn‚Äôt considered that. Thank perspective you‚Äôre right. There‚Äôs never going zero risk‚Äù. people react either one other. first bad second not. 

Like arm super super sore first shot moderna, second arm barely hurt slept 2 days. It‚Äôs insane take second one Oops, thanks clarification; still waking haha don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶have isolate? It‚Äôs really shitty. teenagers school kids found whole thing really hard

you mean lockdowns. question whether someone enforcing quarantines. friend mine got covid person checking boss asking already negative could go back work. Lmao, mean, ok? long sick, guess. day. needs go lol - health officials say wise. Hoping I‚Äôm minority people fully vaccinated still managed recently test positive. fun, means. mixed messaging frustrating. P=Pfizer M=Moderna wonder they'll try fake covid they're hospital ICU. Reminds King Hill episode Peggy trouble coming something news article decides tell people mix two super cleaning power go collect newspapers people get them. favorite part episode newspaper head honcho talking like, ""we editors that...or well guess we'll let go since catch this."" haha someone gets sick, land 14 days ass regardless plans have, realise.  thing data preliminary. Even it‚Äôs correct, still much better could hoped year ago. Also, wear seat belt time save you. mask thing - getting sick normal. It‚Äôs entirely normal get sick. isn‚Äôt normal overrun hospitals tons deaths like last year

Also, vaccines outmaneuvered. Maybe one day we‚Äôll booster shots vaccines btw seat belt. wanted eliminate risk, I‚Äôd drive all. fun would life though? don‚Äôt want afraid live life interact people like world part always done certainly finding breakthrough cases happen. good news likely mild. Avoiding hospitalization death great. considering even mild asymptomatic cases result long covid brain tissue loss, I‚Äôd like evidence vaccine prevents comfortable masking ending.

Source asymptomatic cases causing long covid: brain tissue loss even mild covid: promise you, lots people died them. obvious direct. Sorry thanks. fixed now. like group project hell college years ... really dont think read original comment reaction. Trust me, teenagers would absolutely elated get stay home play video games day. talking friends day gaming them, really dont feel isolated. really dont think teenagers care people themselves, even parents. wouldnt care causes parents worry, wouldnt first place.

Since youre comparing 2020 today, someone isolate 10 days go mostly normal things. 2020, would end isolation period still isolated afterwards, constant fear worry happen next. Today different outlook situation.

So no, doesnt compare, really dont see dont understand original point. vaccinate send back school, eh? speak media Tuesday? comment automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

But widespread. 50% Americans already got least one shot.

This number seems unachievable Russia.

There definitely lot trust authority USA Russia No, there's number vaccines six month period shots. Vaccines could kill someone immunosuppressed immune system weakened factors. worth risk people. It‚Äôs way see never going zero risk. That‚Äôs I‚Äôm wearing mask risk lot people lower even months ago. Also, wasn‚Äôt talking there‚Äôs comments different threads arguing mask mandates brought back everyone. people I‚Äôm referring to

Also it‚Äôs simple caring people not. care people - that‚Äôs got vaccinated. It‚Äôs never don‚Äôt consider others somehow I‚Äôm wearing mask. different perspectives - there‚Äôs nothing wrong all

It‚Äôs piece cloth - way oversimplifies it. It‚Äôs piece cloth many attach Covid wore hospitals overrun many people comborbidites dying

Also, hate say even mask there‚Äôs still risk someone else getting Covid lol. Especially since physical distancing requirements ended many places wrong Moderna? I‚Äôm assuming family believes covid well treating so. University ages teens living alone however, completely different. I‚Äôd venture say adults use fake test tactic teens. friend mine employee ‚Äúwas exposed‚Äù couldn‚Äôt work five times last year alone. It‚Äôs overkill - first shot offers little protection delta variant (as might well bothered get protection). vaccine side effects temporary don‚Äôt lead long term issues. 

Covid does. Covid causes heart damage. Kidney damage. Brain damage. Lung damage‚Ä¶. severe cases. happen mild cases covid well. biggest problem Ivermectin data generated poorly designed studies. mainstream narrative research needs done. Ivermectin could helpful someone needs show high quality study.

You also need careful pick experts. someone PhD MD mean know talking about. evolutionary biology generic MD lend experts clinical trial research, maybe qualified average person would lack sufficient training statistical/research methods understand data fully. really want person degree biostatistics degree related clinical trial research. ask science thread yesterday think. answer was, looks unlikely. Vaccinated far less likely experience severe illness, often much lower viral loads breakthrough, making long covid less likely. 

Can happen? Sure. common? Probably not. No, I'm fully vaccinated. make meth trailer science teacher NO... trusted der leader science. exact vaccine !!

It's ingredients recipe need approved, also cook. case facility produced.

The regulators need ensure production quality sufficiently high consistent. vaccine produced elsewhere may good manufacturing plant messing things up. Case point: Emergent facility US serious quality issues.

SII huge vaccine manufacturer, they'll probably affairs order, facilities still need approved production vaccine. eat tide pods. Stupid animal's.

My daughter's summer school like new case every day. pulled rest summer

Steve Edwards getting fed Wow ‚Äúsomeone know breakthrough Covid case‚Äù tweets really popular today, downthread see it‚Äôs mild/asymptomatic.

It‚Äôs like don‚Äôt want people get vaccine. I'm discussing exact thing article - I'm talking ¬£250 isolation incentive catching Covid people would catch Covid money, like snakes India. ""Nice strawman."" 

You're free think whatever want. I'd simply hope mature enough understand experts disagreeing issues within field expertise natural. silly suggest ""misinformation"" simply one experts question government agency. ...and would suggest pupils interested chemical reactions best place learn chemistry lessons school.‚Äù

As brazilian I'm confused, I'm 1st year high school (so 15-years old) never chemistry lessons last year (which remote) - actually supposed able mix stuff interesting chemical stuff really thing american movies Bully (the Rockstar-made game)? Japan something like 8% vaccinated last week. sure rate now. 

What know vaccine-hesitant compared US. However hesitation appears specific covid vaccine, highest vaccination uptake rates traditional standard vaccines.

One possible explanation Japan governments never mandated lockdowns (their constitution, modeled US constitution, prohibits it), yet never saw apocalyptic death tolls, feel able manage without mass vaccination. put gloves winter, wear rain jacket rains, what's wrong wearing mask public uptick COVID infections flu season widespread infections area? I'm calling repeated lock downs restrictions people defensive masks, work, fact flu basically nonexistent year evidence this. like wear gloves freezing rain jacket rains wear mask widespread community spread contagion COVID flu. Nice strawman. 

According you, skeptical CDC. Maybe entire organization part big conspiracy Dr. Peter Hotez viewed arbiter truth. *That* strikes insane.  moved back long term contract Ireland, stopped Paris moving apartment Antibes. Vaccines dont keep getting this, make strong enough handle it.

It's important overlook ALSO make much less likely get all. proven statistically women prone hypochondria? used hold thermometer light bulb. guys chemistry shit. I'm shocked I've made far comments. Tell common cold worry we're creating impossible expectations vaccines. They're supposed give us protection resume normal life, almost feel like articles like creating standard can't resume normal life unless risk serious illness zero. know we're eventually going see serious breakthroughs effective vaccines, law averages.

I even feel like articles ineffectiveness Chinese vaccines, undoubtedly less effective others, undersells importance getting that's choice available. true protect Seychelles countries surges virus, there's surge going on, I'd rather Sinovac nothing. Mr. Weber, firefighter, adorable. Thx, I'm Holland :)  didn‚Äôt begin expand media aiding hesitance vaccinations correlation AZ debacle.

Try service positions tell work harder cook dishwasher server. went looking Jobs find anything else restaurant washing dishes thing going every position available competing 20 people smaller city look all. failed. think that's important distinction. There's always panic kids astoundingly stupid things, reality urban legend deeper investigation finds maybe one two dumb kids tried once. Sure, there's real things like kids cinnamon challenge bad asthma attacks, there's actual police officers falsely claiming kids fermenting poop get high fumes.  Viruses really good way producing energy, place lot importance physical structure passive ways things, rather even worrying costs more/less energy. 

Viruses also identified physical structure, immune system targeting them. 
Basically, variants different physical structure immune system trained on, immune system worse identifying virus binding it.  
However, different physical structure may also worse binding cells infect, tasks worked relatively old physical structure. 

It's definitely oversimplified, COVID specifically mutations we've focusing mutations spike region, rather ""intricate"" parts virus. Funnily enough, Thailand 20x cases Germany atm.  Delta sending hospital SW Missouri terrible

A comment one person - 

""A booster\* short term could principle reduce effectiveness immune response future variants, leading higher likelihood symptomatic infection. reduce effectiveness vaccine variants. due Hoskins effect, due antibodies low neutralising quality, still manage disrupt kinetics B-cell germinal centre processes. depends different future variants are"" Yep. J&amp;J too. Seems (not surprising) trend. Luckily, you‚Äôre likely mild case (i nasal congestion days followed loss taste smell week) almost certainly wont need hospitalization die covid. findings apply J&amp;J. saying opinion align views government agency misinformation? strikes insane. situation wondering I'm sure viruses work maybe focus energy whatever immune escape rather becoming contagious? wild guess  already written, guaranteed Noticing somewhat influx covid deniers antivaxxers comments (not these, threads). They're always downvoted bottom thread minutes, still frustrating. It‚Äôs misinformation contradicts administration‚Äôs guidance vaccinated individuals. It‚Äôs simple. 

The CDC says Peter Hotez disagrees CNN published article it. 

I take word CDC Dr. Peter Hotez day week. different CNN hypothetically publishing article Michael Yeadon‚Äôs opinion.  Also cases like scare me:  
Is possible get one? sure? found less 200 Delta cases Jakarta. didn‚Äôt say many sequenced, given many people infected there, doesn‚Äôt seem like high number

I'm sorry, speculation statistically misinformed. denominator thing matters. sequenced 200 cases 200 caused Delta, could pretty damn confident Delta dominant. sequenced 2000 found 200 caused Delta, would suggest Delta dominant. I'm sure find numerator &amp; denominator, 87% number correct, something like 200 230 COVID cases would linked Delta. would give us pretty strong evidence Delta dominant.

Don‚Äôt prosecutors better things prosecute people trying right, ethical thing.   go, straight CDC. february like 4 months ago point.

People need get this, massive systems place useless. risk coronavirus enough justify it, ( never lot people‚Äôs, including mine)  long everyone access vaccines, 50 deaths day isnt bad... Canadian here. It‚Äôs looking like everyone wants second dose able get end July ( think? Maybe august ), anyway, high vaccine uptake, one prediction delta variant affect Canada?? opening plans back tracked? I‚Äôm confused delta variant news. stupid knee jerk reaction spikes unvaccinated enclaves like Palmdale / Lancaster currently experiencing. Nothing science changed. take recommendation seriously. doesn‚Äôt scare keep dividing us saying 2 Americans? literally reinforcing articles like these. CureVac‚Äôs stated purpose using unmodified mRNA allows improved induction viral defenses body, including interferon type 1.

This true, unmodified mRNA lead increased interferon release, leads increased PKR production inhibition mRNA translation. slows rate viruses replicating cell.

But guess mRNA vaccine needs work? mRNA translation! That‚Äôs nucleoside modification used, massive increase protein production. Also inflammation effects interferon release ideal reduced significantly modRNA.

CureVac shot foot decision use nucleoside modification, although known beneficial decade. countries bought many different sources. always knew would fail. Death rate danger covid. Google long covid - age predict sticks with, actually yet reliable way predict susceptible long covid. also insignificant proportion kids die end hospital bit. Moreover, there's emerging evidence Delta strain may deadlier overall, including kids. 

For comparison, chicken pox relatively low death rate, I'd pissed someone exposed kid chicken pox vaccine easy way prevent said exposure (i.e., masks). R0 R. R0 rate transmission entirely due virus itself, ie interventions, whereas R current rate transmission given current interventions (eg social distancing, mask use, lockdowns, etc).

So R0 would useful compare various infectious diseases R useful get idea currently dealing moment respect one single infectious disease, covid case.

When it‚Äôs compared measles, they‚Äôre comparing R0 numbers you‚Äôre taking R.   Get vaccinated! Thanks info. ‚ÄúIf world hates you, remember hated first‚Äù gods work mean? 180.6 million vaccinated, equivalent 70% adults.

Jesus fuckijg christ man

This new variant better hype actually unhinged  probably peak infectiousness, breathed right direction person breathed cloud right in, indoors too. Likely several seconds later would dispersed enough person breathed enough catch it. Anyone who‚Äôs getting procedures done getting testing. Also certain jobs test frequently article says Bierrenbach adds coronavirus variant known Gamma P.1, first identified Brazil, may entirely ""Kids dying Brazil since original variant here, addition P.1 variant made kids die countries,"" said. Hopefully people US get gets fully approved mandates start coming in. Besides that, nothing really convincing anti-vaxxers. Moderna dosage per shot contains almost three times mRNA Pfizer shot, remember correctly. Something lot people seem accept, free choice Masks aren‚Äôt effective though, especially little cloth ones sell every store almost everyone wears. barely see anyone wearing N95 similar actually block particles. know gets said lot places legit look like 3rd world countries Holy shit authoritarian think they‚Äôre allowing vaccinated people sporting events? Board member Pfizer says product works. use Pfizer, starts higher effectiveness less problem. got 5:30 pm started getting symptoms 3 called work 4:30 am. Everyone experiences differently hear average 12 hours bulk symptoms Viruses don‚Äôt work like that, I‚Äôm surprised people still seem saying this. Covid-19 aware vaccine, mutates randomly. Vaccine resistant strains would pop whether vaccines not.  agree, addendum: wearing mask always smart compassionate, point time. really started masking long time ago. general else equal. skewed enough age ratio vaccinated may vaccinated people dying expected, that's vaccinated population older higher risk begin they're still safer vaccinated. Plus people would killed flu average year flu stopped cold. COVID make could get started excess deaths.

Dang, looked up, that's 50K people so. rounding error compared million. Found person sat next hour long meeting Monday Covid. sniffles meeting.

I've fully vaccinated Moderna family flying across county couple days.

If show symptoms, fly? UK isn‚Äôt good long-term example they‚Äôre weird place highly-vaccinated older population they‚Äôve started vaccinate young adults. US better case study, we‚Äôve got mixture high low vaccination areas, vaccine available adults months, it‚Äôs entirely based personal risk assessment. places covid manageable levels though. understand places case, fortunate situation vaccinated around mostly vaccinated people, masks really something needed. centralized authority manage response. Transportation federal orders September reexamined. Dentists following professional guidelines, many aren't, state regulation lax. NCAA concerned avoiding bad headline anything else.

No restriction necessary unnecessary. must implement enough restrictions keep transmissions certain invisible threshold disaster ensues. necessarily consistent fair accomplish goal, enough keep hospital beds free.

And CDC lie. Sufficient N95s general public simply exist. one said work; needed preserved healthcare workers. think cloth masks would help think asymptomatic spread significant driver infection. learned was, clear cloth mask could actually help message changed. Kids always vulnerable population disease, though. disease particular deadly majority children. long incapacitating symptoms take kick in? I'm getting second Moderna shot next week I'm bicycling home vaccination site. course, according gov ‚Äúthere‚Äôs evidence catch covid trains‚Äù. kinda tried reduce people recommending companies work remotely move business start time, reducing number trains ended making even crowded. None effective don‚Äôt think gov really tried either. honestly sucks see people coughing wearing masks coughing talking loud.  Young adults recently eligible get first dose, make bulk cases. That‚Äôs cases nearly all-time high, deaths hospitalizations low. UK really fucked putting hard date reopening instead tying vaccination rates (especially amongst younger cohorts). basically said they'd open up, rescinded people would listen least also ones least vaccinated. coming area high vaccine compliance good overall healthcare access. point, seems reasonable treat covid something like mumps flu. Meaning, mandated mask use needed.

I understand places lucky, one day caught hold true It‚Äôs seems we‚Äôve solved farm labor shortage problem everyone. people work fields socially distancing. born raised Arkansas. innocence charming, willful ignorance not.

In time leading February year, excess deaths significantly: remember Obama ever suggesting stop testing coronavirus... doubt Biden either... there's certain someone two suggest it, remember correctly. 
 Would get moderated mention him, though

Delta DOOM, since appear much deadly previous iterations. means much higher herd immunity threshold, 80-85% instead 65-70%. way threshold country. see effect already country - high vaccination places leveled instead continuing drop, low vaccination places slowly increasing already.  Hahaha real though, they're worried spied on, tracked, yet they're perfectly willing use cell phone every single day that! know... feel like people need enemies, any, create something benign. They're article. vaccine? Post-Covid health problems common even among people gotten sick virus all, study found. nearly half patients hospitalized Covid-19 experienced subsequent medical issues, 27 percent people mild moderate symptoms 19 percent people said  Yeah people idiots.. already cell phones that! One vaccine 79% effective infection Delta variant, 60% effective. Delta positives twice likely admitted hospital Alpha positives. 30% Delta variant hospital admissions fully vaccinated, country 1/2 vaccinated.

This sunny outcome headline suggests. offers protection, yes. Team Moderna let's hear noiiiiseeee! comment thread literally someone saying know loads people who've caught covid doses, UK.

And yet, merely seen, also merely seen? jump anecdotes?

It fact British Reddit users peers yet double vaccinated. 50s UK yet double vaxed. redditors millennials. possible person knows frontline NHS staff, sure. reasonable skeptical. even do, fact mention shows skewed perspective.

I could pointed without accusing lying would still come across skepticism truth. good goals life here, I'm saving fucks people life want vaccine can't take can't get yet. Hey! Sounds like me.

[CDC faq, see last Taipei, July 1 (CNA) Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) said Thursday Taiwan recorded 50 new cases COVID-19, infection source two patients infected Delta variant virus Pingtung County confirmed.

Of 50 new cases, 47 domestically transmitted. Thursday marked seventh consecutive day Taiwan reported case totals 100, CECC data shows.

Speaking CECC press briefing, Health Minister Chen Shih-chung (Èô≥ÊôÇ‰∏≠) said cluster infections continue focus prevention efforts Taiwan, though cluster Pingtung County caused Delta variant seems contained.

No new cases cluster confirmed Thursday, Chen said, adding CECC determined two patients cluster, whose infection source previously unknown, became infected.


The two patients, farmer wife, visited¬†Fangliao General Hospital Pingtung¬†at time another person also tested positive, two parties consultation rooms separated one room, said CECC official Lo Yi-chun (ÁæÖ‰∏ÄÈàû).

Got hands CS. fun lake week. feel like now-a-days would labeled terrorist growing No, absolutely compare whole group. *All Europe* significantly worse Finland Norway. honest assessment data conclude Sweden bad outlier among three, Finland Norway two outliers among entire region.

When exclude places population &lt; 1 million, Worldometers 35 countries Europe. Pretty much wound 1000 - 2000 COVID deaths per capita range. little higher range (Hungary, Czechia, Bulgaria) little lower (Germany, Netherlands, Ireland, Russia - although think latter's data suspect).

There basically 4 countries look like rest Europe list - Denmark, Belarus, Finland, Norway. latter two especially unusual &lt;200 deaths/capita.

Sweden ranked right middle list - #19 35. disingenuous argument IMO fault like two outliers cherry-picked similarities. Sweden hit hard heavy early 2020, much well-understood, especially concerning best protect nursing homes. Much mortality came period. think would entertain argument egg faces New York Massachusetts (who also got hit hard heavy early on) worse COVID deaths per capita Florida.

Using nation-wide population density group Sweden Norway Finland also distorts mischaracterizes true level vulnerability, i.e. density people actually live. biggest metro area Sweden (Stockholm) good deal denser Oslo Helsinki. top that, Sweden's overall population density (25) close Finland (18) Norway (15), also closer countries way worse Sweden like Bulgaria (64) Bosnia (64), Italy (206) U.K. (281).

There absolutely way, right now, control endless confounding factors able say ""X country done better country able to"". We're years, maybe decades away getting point precision. experts today can't neither you. say certainty Sweden's results were, region, pretty much average. whatever extent comparatively light-touch approach restrictions, wound neither best worst country Europe.

For flu season, I‚Äôm wearing one. It‚Äôs don‚Äôt care people, would suggest don‚Äôt wear one, it‚Äôs getting sick normal. Getting severely sick overrun hospitals isn‚Äôt normal. That‚Äôs reason wear masks year

Also, flu season - I‚Äôd rather avoid people sick avoid others am. can‚Äôt - wash hands, cover coughs, also healthier. would amazing much better we‚Äôd people exercised healthier 

What gets hear people say mask flu season want to. different approach - that‚Äôs fine don‚Äôt force everyone else shame thing

I'm gonna say first, think said podcast may interesting way know medically valid I'm expert subject means. 

The second part is, listened podcast, besides Ivermectin, credence things they're discussing, sources cited outdated disproven, kinda like ""vaccine autism"" paper?

It‚Äôs like speeding. Many people speed despite fact actions could often hurt kill people. could choose speed still do. people fact country speed. make bad person? No

In case guess I‚Äôm trying say I‚Äôm following CDC says that‚Äôs really simple be. people say oh CDC wrong even though doctor scientist skip school. (F) one P 1st, 2nd side effects all. 2 F friends also side effects both. skip tests school something.  basically I'm understanding vaccine still effective preventing variant causing harm, however variant spreads easily even amongst vaccinated folks?
