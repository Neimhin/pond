0,2020-11-01," US Elections suppose? ""We best. number one again"" doc's brother mortician, dad owns funeral parlor specializing kid sized coffins Ah he's European Trump since actually cares protecting citizens. probably big reason many us making Christmas though. Severe asthma good enough reason California, 21, may surprised. Thank god didnt go b'day.  Ohh Thank you. agree, tbh. I’m huge party, I’m seeing people really really need too. Try nanofiber masks www.filti.com Scotty, cunt. wear goddamn mask defeat them! look Electoral Commissions then. Masks protect 30% max. virus virus does. do, sometimes get it. It’s fault. It’s pandemic. simply must endure. Glad well. corruption unreal. might aswell dismiss current vaccines garbage stocks pharma companies.  talking left borders open badly infected Italy long enough formula 1 drivers get country? Mexican media reporting constantly right US media generally focus much Mexico's problems.

I live Mexico presume death count even inaccurate US count many many rural areas little access hospital care. Maybe ""excess deaths"" informative line government track it, lot Mexicans dying without test like US covid hurt you?

I disagree saying. I'm saying American better chance living covid Texan non-Texan. statistic headline might imply Texas big bad, they're mainly big. know people downvoting you. Although check math comments, general gist saying correct. 90% accuracy low something rolled everywhere. No. can’t right now. Correlation /= Caucasian Stay safe, friend. 

Everyone wants best - really. smaller population whole lot “freedom” like implying what's happening jn Europe coming us? “at least half population vitamin deficiency”

So half population already deficiency... True. Fauci saying wearing masks social distancing early 2022. stay home What's plan kids? Virtual learning till vaccine maybe year ensure rate infection suitable level? Privileged fuck setup able swing that. people fortunate. 

It'll interesting see flighty people vaccine released still active cases floating around. It'll interesting kids end shut ins months potentially years. Either way, listening available evidence covid-19 risk children. amount evidence remove fear have. People like go living, people like become neurotic basketcase shut-ins. C'est la vie. never late. covid czar, would federal mask requirement people indoors essential business.   
I would also use defense production act get air disinfecting equipment installed nursing homes, using state two testing areas see works. Nursing homes currently high generator fatalities, fatalities winding hospitals first. air handling equipment reduced fatalities hospital load issues, I'd roll nationwide.       
There stuff done. But, first step end denialism. Care insult way people Liverpool it?

When wasn’t even people Liverpool “big one” hey ho let’s trash anyway. Ricky Bobby, you? theory checks-and-balances generally work, clear.

They end giving excess power small blocs obstructionists, facilitates reactionary outcomes seeing now.  No, let's destroy society want sweet deal getting free money stay pajamas watching Netflix day please thank you. I'll never live cause I'm ex Mormon triggering. damn, Utah nicest scenery world. I'm fine breathing air public there's COVID issues, yeah. Actually totally fine it. guess like entire population last fifty years COVID insane guess. lol. one country called United Kingdom. don’t individual embassies, armed forces, international treaties, aren’t members UN. label first national division “countries” doesn’t literally make such. Wales country Texas. Hell even Puerto Rico “country” wales 10% false positives negligible game-changing rapid test like this. something like deployed widescale, free *ton* PCR testing capacity. could develop strategies compensate false positives, like PCR testing within suspected false positive randomized population groups, sentinel surveillance. literally copied pasted article. Fauci also said things back normal point next year. seriously, close US drowning people test see witches? Well even though live America never get virus cause know Parkour. virus cant climb buildings I'm good. can't protect nursing homes. friend works nursing homes. Quit one month ago outbreak. immediately hired another... outbreak week. people wearing masks btw like stated facts experience whole year (generally horrible interruptions fuck year caused me), comment gets fucking deleted. Sorry experience broadcasted mainstream media fact checked random websites confirm true. (lol imagine websites existing solely purpose keep people line, case people might start question things).

Reddit literally nothing echo chamber, anything goes narrative gets deleted, downvoted, hated, etc.

Pathetic. also live west coast use public transportation many times since started. part made think less average human before, never thought possible, gained HUGE amount respect Asian American culture universal understanding science exists working together good thing. Hope so. guy symptom - disease himself. read like poem? think economy... one must die economy! twat. Remember mentioned live TV? shameful it’s come far! imagine death thing fear covid instead large swaths survivors living long term brain organ damage? 

Imagine shithole country Texas nearly 19,000 *official* covid deaths look bad. Australia 907 covid deaths. Indonesia 13,800 covid deaths 280 million people. Thailand double Texas population 59 covid deaths. Yeah Texas going logic. first national divider UK labeled “country” doesn’t literally mean England sovereign country. English Trump bad Brazilian Trump American Trump. fucking moron, like half world apparently, feel need ruin entire world economy something barely life threatening flu. 

Do lockdown neighborhood every time someone gets flu nan die?

This isnt ebola virus/fungus/disease kills healthy young people droves, much every scaremonger twat wants believe otherwise, sometimes kills people things kill first, old sick/weak.
Herd immunity pretty much option lockdowns delay that. Modern citizens UK US never major crisis like war make shared sacrifice. 

This it... *really* important everyone knows repeats lot. Pretty much anti-masker science (and fox news, whitehouse guy) rests **fact** mask great protecting getting sick. *And right really good stopping getting others sick. anti-maskers never talk that. Probably even aware it.

Amazing downvoted hiring nail squarely head. sub places. OP said 2 weeks only. Idk dude replied whole pandemic. difficult him. lose house received $1200 instead normal 2 week paycheck need make life changes. really think relevant statistic internet access? I’m talking Per capita People want extra cautious lives loved ones person gatherings ALL, let alone complaining lifesaving recommendations.

I love family avoiding much possible keep safe.

This joke California's huge population poses serious threat people continue becoming complacent. Please contribute many voices downplaying it, especially discussing populous state 4 huge cities hospitals overrun. That's whole point lockdown. They're reaching full capacity able cope. One same. Trump's govt reflection intelligence avg American Stay dumb :) Here's end... We're going massive crisis sudden everyone complete alignment covid. 

When we're 500k-1M dead going look 2020 hindsight.

And thanks exponential growth could feb. get new leadership, things get better. less accurate tests miss positives catch people first contagious generally give false positive.

This kind test terrible way determine safe (non-contagious), cheap fast way catch lot people first contagious get quarantine infect others. accurate test expensive, slow, pain administer used like this.

So one types tests, really useful used correctly. Give everyone test every day everyone still wears masks practices distancing. 

The problem people dumb, they'll think test gives clear means safe need wear masks distance. That's test be, say, worse useless carefully intelligently used. Considering protests that's happening since May Trump, surprising either. Everything's bigger texas Almost every EU govt got control least summer. US didnt one way, ""successfully buried avalanche untruth"" - using word there, snowing someone fooling - specifically constant barrage lies. *Banjo playing stops* Greatest country world! Woo! bad. level good hygiene would expect people handle food provide medical services. surprise one  [archive link anyone trouble accessing article worst case scenario nothing deaths, although totals could awful.

The worst case scenario social services start grinding halt people sick scared leave houses. Hospitals full take sick people. Supply chains begin breaking grocery stores can't get orders filled. worst case scenario. 

I see evidence that, humans panicky creatures take long stability break they're spooked. 

Put way: people go work sense self-interest (for part), order give income necessary live. fear going work going kill them, long internal calculus begins shift say ""screw that"". many grocery clerks, truck drivers, warehouse personnel, inspectors, factory workers, etc afford lose serious situation emerges? 

That always been, remains, serious potential outcome virus. would sweep across world quickly enough economies end paralyzed one available willing work. people say ""nah, ain't worth $12 hour, think I'll stay home."" Let’s see quickest sarcastic hint political comment involves loss lives perhaps lives loved ones. Lots states don’t even start counting mail ballots Tuesday Probably can't anything til election per president guess. start shutting things people afraid go vote. Rounding corner yall. s/ Uh workers fast food places enclosed places ventilation.

Yeah, terrible. like essential workers they're forced continue work unsafe conditions rest us continue survive. Personally, I'm risking kind fast food. industry notorious putting employees situations they're forced come work even know sick. high risk environment, fact constant contact random people, (as said) often younger I'm eating fast food infection rate area drops significantly shows sustained decline. 

That however, possible I'm privileged position multiple grocery stores deliver door. everyone lucky. everyone store reliably get *at all*. everyone cook home 2 weeks (let alone since march like I've been).  

While I'm taking risk, fast food high risk. steps take decrease risk. Drive thru/delivery only, mask wearing entire time, gloves handle packages, etc. things calm down, first fast food I'll go pizza. Delivered door, never even see driver. Pizza spends little time oven boxed less likely coughed on, easily discard box door transfer pizza plates without touching food touched box without washing hands. Yeah idk man...that seems bit much. would different virus contagion movie like 30% lethality rate. everything reason stop covid shit like George Orwell 1984 fiction Well that's... Comforting? thing surely can't wear mask wear visor, rarely see 420,000 people killed WWII US alone. want compare two global scale, it’s 85 million vs 1.2 million. real. Football trash decade. never let Mike Leach go. think part due way vaccine trials set up. mainly designed show difference symptoms vaccine group control group. Testing whether actually stops infection (or stops contagious) priority - reducing illness is.

I'm basing Modern's phase 3 protocol - (efficacy statements start page 10) although looks like asymptomatic infections listed secondary efficacy statements, maybe one later analyses.

So maybe first vaccines sterilising immunity, testing priority, might know soon (and maybe approval?). course I'm scientist maybe I'm guilty reading lines bit. Exactly friend ? already ahead 100k cases day Obviously need care try follow trying protect yourself. Otherwise can't effectively unless completely quarantined without *any* contact others.  y’all feel Poland’s 100k plus protest? figured would torch lighting ceremony tonight. 1 month old acct speaks.. Covid serious. 

On one hand communist China welded people apartments forced others camps/hospitals. seemed work though. 

On hand Europe US flexible severe lockdown start. virus spread much further.

There easy choices. Except wear mask limit social contact. 

Is choice government individual? That’s arguing about. easy choices. then, real hoax? Yeah, get people tired restrictions, going 400-person party beyond-beyond irresponsible excuse it. Nobody *needs* go 400-person party ""mental health"" ""blowing steam"" far less dangerous options. Lockdown exhaustion BS. Terrible awful stupid idea think pretty bad take hope gets worse US people criticizing country. 50%+ population believes needs done, powerless.

Want criticize US leadership? Dentist open/ available, likely safer going Walmart.

I went 3 days ago, peridontist. Tooth yank, plus dental surgery. arrival dentist , basic prescreen ( temperature, questionaire) .

 Air filters running, N 95 masks medical masks, face shields, gloves, etc.

 pharmacist Dentist ( well trained infection control, educated) want catch it, give it.  Shopping food dangerous. 

Medical/ Dental help may going contract ( collapse ) early 2021. Get done now-ish, wait 2022. Good luck. can't read study:  *The* 
*communities Trump rallies took place paid high price terms disease death.* Haha nice whataboutism bro, great arguement. 

But since asked, would followed public health advice country disease letter like hoped mum whos nurse never deal them. Living rent free head, obviously. I've drinking lot iced tea lol orange juice doubt healthy. Good advice. Normally worried everyone around given they're getting sick. I've kinda reached point acceptance get get it. There's nothing do. yeah I'll prepare stay healthy possible. People thought pandemic depopulation plan realised world contain billions people, disease killed 1.2 million people roughly 10 months best tool shed. Thanks posting. went straight main results study: 

“Our results suggest rallies resulted 30,000 incremental cases likely led 700 deaths.” Yup. saying while. bank vaccine planning handling mess. lot people seem hopes dreams pinned vaccine coming around soon everything goes back normal. That'd nice, reality might cooperative.

However, even partially effective vaccine deployed at-risk population might tamp death toll -- without massive reduction cases, we'll still defensive. I'm concerned someone clearly knows little virus state politics feels need make literally thousands comments it.

Get life champ thing schools one wearing face masks socially distancing (primary school sixth form), could easily changed older year groups follow rules like wearing masks, university person teaching carried masks socially distanced way less outbreaks (at least uni) There’s post already first pg subreddit titled “‘Scary wrong’: Utah epidemiologist’s home address leaked online protest”. What’s point lol. Darwin awards finest Dentists, general, extremely careful get infected interacting people every day. 

I would go really annoying affecting livelihood go something routine. much care respiratory viruses diseases like tuberculosis (kills 1 million/year) February 2020? tough then? lockdowns one consequence must never, ever belittle, making poor people awful lot 

Careful. Words like arouse UK Conservatives. area 6X covid hospitalizations compared early June, skyrocketing case counts too. pouring kind extra gas fire worrisome. said, believe trick treating pretty minimal risk, still much risk kids -- scavenger hunt instead. moving cheaper area option, state? confirm, shop worker. told challange person hidden disability refuse service disceimination. know HD situation. complex lot people talking codswallop say it(hell got three four members staff say weeks bought pretty little badges). issue know people HD, lot fact, hard can't trust phrase now. go enough already, lumped non believers lazy people too. Children fun vs. burning businesses housing black Latino neighborhoods Lol governments fault people wear mask cover chin thier nose. Hurt feelings? Go back nobody leave grown work rest us *some* people’s life vs *many* people’s livelihoods. makes decision much harder much, yes flu killed 35k 2018-2019 winter season opposed covid killing 230k 8 months you! got mine.* ru ok? Michigan I've left last line out, final verse would missed context. 
It blows mind country come together something like WWII war effort victory gardens, rationing sacrifices greater good. willingly give freedoms Patriot act never want another 9/11 happen ever.

Brand new virus known cure limited treatment burning country eight months? ""You benot tell can't eat Applebee's best tell wear mask American, goddamn libtards."" important thing one mentioned contact tracing, particularly Sydney (a city 5 million) managed clamp cases 0 20 per day 4 months testing tracing almost businesses open masks worn people (though see mask wearing spike cases too). person tests positive, often within mere hours public alerts issued close contacts contacted instructed take test isolate 2 weeks.

We’re able suppress like got numbers low begin with. people said Melbourne’s failures quarantine tracing leading second wave proof lockdowns (and elimination) solution - like think Sydney fact proof squash curve begin absolutely use testing tracing (and sensible regulation) avoid future lockdowns restrictions. Decades priming intense peer pressure. Hopefully, hand shaking goes style also. Yeah we're right fucked. I'm happy hear Anthony Fauci holding back Trump Dr. Atlas anymore. Things getting really bad, get far worse. Please delete comment saying simply truth, I'm sincerely worried lame duck session Trump loses election. punish nation, anything comes trying slow spread, COVID stimulus. really really dark days ahead. Please stay safe guys. mean theres also lots evidence children's cases going unreported. Like saw Utah hospitals reached capacity. still dont understand? Man education system failed you.

Imagine bring ruby princess comeback like anything me. hindsight huge fuck hey hindsight locking borders January also fuck up, going go attack everyone involved nah? Staffed who? I'm retail worker means people get treat even like shit *""Texas Capacity, I'm place without we're perfectly fine!""* Yeah, like Socialism hasn’t properly tried yet. Whatever. Close absolutely everything 4 weeks (two incubation periods) maximum enforcement, it'll damn near burn out. 

We it, that's little it'd take. young people Europe weren’t partying? UK literally something called “party weekend” weeks ago. say anything? Everyone always complains worker say anything, complainer say anything either. think normal cloth mask good enough flight much circulate air cabin. That’s outdoors much better avoiding COVID — good air circulation. fine. Also Cummings' mates done suspiciously well untendered government contracts. learned year ago, thanks spotify discover. Also I'm Canadian Americans also weird fetish troop law enforcement worship major sporting events, relate that. know Germany sporting event opening ceremonies. surprised add last lyric: ""How protect cult death?."" feel also highly relevant. boat man. Lost work months, lost birthday, car, almost everything man. people party ignore distancing rules. fucked. I'm quit existence cause cannot home working next year. I've done hiking camping distanced bullshit activities u do. wanna fucking live normal life can't there's reason stay alive. want wait. close paying debt pandemic increased. lost major job opportunities would changed life forever. I'm utterly fucked. Even wait thing basically lost 3 years progress life. There's point anymore everyone fucking people like us over. never late tackle problem... skills resources, much luck.

That's problem around. Wrong leadership, incorrect investments. Misogyny, nice! people could catch year instead 2-3x increasing risk.

You corrected point before. Stop spreading misinformation sub. Oh, sell VW Golf??

/s exactly think enforced ? math, boils individual responsibility matter much wish someone else's problem Yep. Sweden: 5,938 deaths... leak things every time “test public mood”. time public mood “why fuck leaked left everyone worry?”, reacted announcement.  Please go dentist. United Kingdom Union countries. Dentists high risk Im glad police going partygoers (most wearing masks) instead dealing NYC’s crime problem. don’t agree decision party, NYPD bigger fish fry. insult? I'll admit I've half way inside store realised I'm wearing mine couple times though idea ‘opt-in hybrid’ model is. Why? it’s NYC relevant U.K. schooling U.K. management COVID fatality rate India (like Africa) lot lower US. Even assume deaths India 50% actual reported number still way lower US UK. potentially lower age lesser obesity. months back hospitals overcrowded. hospital beds much free. importantly coming time country much open western countries. 

There likely smaller outbreaks next 4-6 months looks like worst India. Ah, makes sense. really aimed curbing global population growth, would target regions highest birth rates, geriatric West. Sounds like something wanna talk about. 4 vaccines last stage trials, tens thousands people signed getting shots (one UK, 2 US, 1 China). trials prove safe effective are. yet announced effective are, seem safe. Maybe within month two we'll get announcement least one groups. What's latest research infection rates touching infected surface VS airborne? told thought fine, would believe you. many options kids physical play sucks. course it. course worse things life. course there's purpose it....but tell fucking suck. Cause does. wearing masks work transit. Lots shit sucks, remember back April/May (before common knowledge) trying alert friends dangers indoor environments poor air circulation, jogger passing street worried threat, needed know masks might protect certain situations. 


I \*firmly\* got shouted anti-masker, even though clearly wasn't. room conversation anything masks. Since then, two friends gotten COVID ""no idea got it"" wear masks time. I'm worried governments properly plan next winter. 

We need take advantage time implement things like standardized QR systems businesses across country. 

We need consolidate processes test trace across regions. Vic Salesforce driven system managing tracing rolled everywhere linked QR system.

We need app phone try tricks like Bluetooth proximity, instead simple things like keep diary we've been, matched business QR records if/when test positive.

We need aged care *standards* employment cross-site tracking get outbreaks spreading next winter.

That needs leadership Federal ministers like Hunt Colbeck... kidding, happen. Based numbers:

0.49% WW2 deaths Americans.

19.16% Covid deaths Americans. certainly are. one infinite examples, people spend money online fun could giving help get food starving people. Write letter, read candle light shout across lawn, don’t need computers people going without food. Murdoch media empire. main objective death destruction. important still need keep away people much possible, wear mask cant, possible ventilate space hand sanitise. #Defundthepoliceunlesstheyenforcemyorders Fear anxiety states. Texas early voting ended Friday, mail ballots pretty much limited 65+ folks, November 3rd chance left cast vote now. There's new 9/11 every 3.5 days based today's numbers seems like country give shit. !remindme 2 months reminds people parties currently positions great importance honest tests. Largely depends live states, you’re going halloween parties big gatherings (especially you’re college), chances you’re probably gonna get it. indoor golf Good ya! good ventilation? air recycled filtering there’s high community spread, yeah, waitstaff gonna get exposed. One study 20% grocery store workers testing positive antibodies, there’s ostensibly reason customers remove masks. still safe enough kids go school people going continue visiting family Germans also going Netherlands party shop Nethlerlands far less contain virus. inefficient lockdown prove lockdowns can't work. people absorb vitamin worse others,or live locations largely overcast. Plenty people get outside often vitamin deficiency, blaming solely ridiculous. 

And another commenter pointed out, large portions world winter months leave people darkness. Doesn’t matter much get outside there’s sunlight day.

The vast majority people, regardless often get outside, would find vitamin supplements beneficial. Unless work requires outside large portions day (in place consistent sunlight) you’re probably deficient. ""new cases"" comes free state sponsored well hospital testing.

This statement makes clear share ""bipartisan"" understanding. new cases come people quarantining, wearing masks, social distancing. Testing confirms quarantining, wearing masks, social distancing results infections. mean ""new cases come testing"" ""cases we’re testing more"" continually assert. Mormon church covid position? Yeah live small town agricultural university, cases students came back suddenly whole county. think necessarily student's fault, think government let go back. brother stuck Nottingham now, paying 9K year, classes online anyway. proud Victoria Melbourne. Incredible progress! COVID taking surprise. little people willing stop spreading.  Utahns doesn’t sound right Another reason never visit hellhole. real mods aren’t better able this, you’re probably introvert. people also don’t need find someone get married. Others running time. America always gotta best cases went 40% Monday Friday; 25% 2 days (Wed-Fri). also - hospitalization growth terrifying, lagging indicator. think got uncontrolled exponential growth since significant adjustment safty measures going see huge growth within next days. Makes sense. It’s lot reporting counties giving numbers. means super safe effective. Not. Yeah, I'm Illinois (not bad Montana, surging incredibly right now), one schools worked announced grand plan start bringing back in-person classes TWO DAYS AGO. take four weeks, thanks Jeeze. wife got tested last week results (negative) back less 24 hours. Australia recorded new cases across country community transmission. 

There 175 active cases, large proportion hotel quarantine overseas travelers. agree though can't see antibody numbers they're article due paywall. summer holidays/travel, season workers countries ? chechz didnt huge 1st wave, virus came country via travel. imo Morons EU Law German bureaucracy prevent/delay certain things.

Last hilarious example lemonade call lemonade less 7% sugar. labeled conspiracy theorist telling people take vitamin March. 90,000/86,400 cases per second. (Thank Kris Allen) people realize large america's population is. half europe's, half western hemisphere. 

America large (completely unacceptable) total positives we've never fully constrained virus, shame, infection rate still much lower Europe's. takes US right 6 weeks infect 1% population. Europe whole 1% every 5 weeks, several countries inside 1% every 8 days 1% every 3 weeks. 

(to honest, couple states, ND SD, growing rate Belgium. Side side, worst/best states versus europe's worst/best countries, pretty comparable.) mom coming United States flee lockdown. planning ungodly hungover Wednesday due election drive airport early morning. Thanks lot UK. wish y'all worn masks. Amazing job Australia! It’s illegal immune system function nature intended. Yeah kind point, politically safe wait it’s bad unfortunately seems like.  Bojo needs nearby times. Johnson genius underneath idiot act 🤷🏼 said governments counting Covid deaths increase profit get paid it. 

So money coming from? economies shrinking, tax base collapsing deficits exploding profiting governments?

And understand accounted season respiratory viral spread known established thing long time relates surge respiratory virus. Don’t act like Europe ain’t also fire Thats crazy. insurance covers like 5 pages stuff. Things don’t even know wth are. Today's numbers brought Jane Wayne Gacy. Thanks opinion, effect anyone else allows go shops prior hopped Xanax. Mask xanax? One addicting awful makes feel awful comes car carry on. Yeah.

It's different coping mechanism people use deal severe anxiety ptsd. drain life well being. Everyday challenge. know story. I'm 36 therapy since 18. think know what's best me.

Thank though concern. Mental illness black white thing visible thing see fix. wish was.

I terrible allergies noticed masks helped really well too.

I'm Japan, many Asian countries prior covid, people wore masks air quality issues/pollen/illness multitude reasons like feeling insecure, anxiety, comfort.

It hurts absolutely one, even me. created lot health problems XXL sizes, additives got banned countries give certain reputaiton pink slime. law school almost certainly provides free therapy service students. use it. think UK going goal. They're trying stop hospitals morgues getting overloaded :/ Eh, play video games FaceTime people. It’s worth spread shit right now. Saying single person alone apartment. Mask junkies real disease. felt need mention he’s Republican because? Huh? 

“So ran friend day! She’s Republican. Anyways says hi.”

People obsessed politics it’s hilarious. It’s even issues anymore TEAM Meanwhile Brazil people ignoring Covid cease exist. Sometimes hate country. That's situation uk. hospitals capacity, already sending people worst areas less overrun hospitals. non-urgent appointments cancelled again, kill thousands even register statistics get diagnosed something deadly early enough save them.

Lung cancer diagnoses something like 70%, doubt covid secretly curing lung cancer.

This get government ignores scientific advisors literally every major decision point tries farm billions pounds mates giving test trace contracts companies literally capability deliver need.

It's fucking disgusting uk can't get test trace working 12 billion ireland get working 750k. didn’t USA that? too. first test work took 16 days. already another test waiting results. need breath test, would awesome! Yeah, created character millions people worship. lot less important private life. Beat it. people saying take 50k prescription capsules that's D2. going make jails superspreader location then? 

I would strongly prefer house arrest. way better vote chode chode enablers fuck office.

VOTE! ND county one highest per capita positive rates state...and bars open Halloween parties tonight. Big props Victorians, especially Melbourne. Doughnuts all! yanks preconception Brits bad teeth, know get dental NHS, next nothing fees? totally free 18 years old.  bandana medical mask N95 likely conceal aggressive look mask...because thin layer cotton isn’t much already legit protection N95. random, policy. Old population, heavy smokers, hug Chinese person policy pandemic ramped pretty stupid politically correct move. Maybe also wonder still keep getting colds. 7 days still quite long too. havent gotten cold flu like 8+ years listening recent Sam Harris podcast today infectious diseases expert Nicholas Christakis (ep #222) predicted little change terms need masks/distancing/remote work-learning entirety 2021. due availability/effectiveness/willingness take vaccine. 2024 likely year could imagine virus control enough return completely 'normalcy' achieved.

It's pretty interesting listen I'd recommend giving go.  Thank answering. weird! Wait. saying tested positive, six days later lost sense smell? Crazy! long feel dizziness? latent symptoms? 

Covid fucking weird. Im saying. Well take aged like Yep, I'd also love see people denied care they've eating fast food smoked well, get five hours exercise week. banned health care system. anticipatory move US election? Yeah good luck shutting house lord. Jesus craves donations economy topic, believe antibody numbers best estimate. antibody tests done summer. Ones done right swept March much higher, although done lot less scientifically. good headline? 

""Old guy nothing, news 10"" think growth rate fast yet. EU cases much faster doubling rate many countries even cases lower August September, US cases taken 6 weeks double 7 day average. reason get drunk people, kids go trick-or-treating, big thing America though. See quickly randomly wanted get little political battle. “Yeah trumps taxes meh!” dude didn’t even mention trump. You’re reason Trump gets much attention literally answered questions. It’s still clear you’ve read answer know it’s saying. individual needs make sacrifices, doesn’t matter big total population. sound like you’re convinced easy everyone else it’s different you. Therefore don’t worry making sacrifices enjoy Covid outbreak assertion. ""new cases"" comes free state sponsored well hospital testing. testing confirmed new cases. bipartisan understanding convenient FREE testing recently exposed showing symptoms huge factor seeing ones actually infected virus. comes far willing trust word Government. Personally, fiance home since end March. restaurant, holiday, trips anywhere nice... think worth risking it, many did.

If take Gov advice, kill you, don't, going government advice. lose-lose.

The UK government subsidised infections summer, we'll get ""whoops, lol soz"". held accountable, be. Ya can. Canada mandatory enforced. wearing mask? getting store.

There's people standing entrance telling wash/sanitize hands also. Apparently one pushed initial lockdown. scientists sage busy debating merits herd immunity, Cummings suggested close down. idea Cummings “Mr Herd Immunity” true. sage members initially advocated approach wrongly thought virus would follow trajectory flu. sunday 2am utc Wtf country become UK, current amount spread per capita 5 times worse Victoria, Australia four months ago (when went severe lockdown). taken time strict restrictions take us 5 cases day. UK thinks 4 weeks going sort rude awakening get German ""Neighborculture"". reason envy simply bored people spy neighbors report authorities. Usually police rolls eyes, sometimes small fine feeling fullfillment particular neighbor.

A system reporting encouraged hefty fine involved means wars neighbours turn perfect execution rules neighbour report every tiny detail.

You go back 90s early 2000s internet mainstream find biggest memes time come ""Neighborculture""

Also wrong parents came East Germany. father victim Stasi mothers family branch participated willingly liked system hated certain neighbor.

When comes WW2 sides civilians(the majority civilians believed everything radio newspaper) paternal side got family members killed allied bombing.

So stop alt BS especially clue talking about. Dont start shitty UK!! I'm racking brain trying figure Liverpool Street halloumi related That's crazy imagine correct, 774,400 6ft x 6ft squares square mile think mostly social construct ""decadence"" (for lack better term.) I've read hunter-gatherer societies tend much less gendered farmer societies. [Another example nomadic Scythians appear female Mongols used teach women fight like men.

While obviously biological differences men women think lot things people tend think ""innate"" actually are. Priming us next revelation. Never never will. bad worldometer 787 last sat it’s bad. Still higher lows. plan: Get infected, make excuses.

The article touches US needs lockdowns: meaningful contact tracing, means cannot meaningful quarantines.  Without quarantines, lockdowns option. Mitten here. direct quote status person let move in. favor stuck living EX.  


""""While we're subject, personally I'd rather see people putting minor risk keep mental state check rather depressed couped up.

People self-employed benefit scheme there's separate program available support self-employed believe significantly less effective. Yup, waiting lines outside, proper distances ppl. Whole action prepared short time, pretty good. Yeah, I've posting incessantly vitamin ages SAD relatively well controlled year D3 suppliments occasional blood work. years I've taking I've keeping tabs vitamin encounter evidence POC really consider year long suppliments UK bring POC Friends appropriate. get bottle £8 years worth drops, 6 months need higher dose. I've bought quite people vitamin result small price pay hopefully healthier friends family. Money issue within 6 months reaping benefits healthier immune system. studies focused antibodies produced response viral protein known NP.

Wrong.

After digging bullshit press reports, found [the original paper REACT lateral flow test used study detects antibodies spike protein (anti-S) Idiot bigly! 4 weeks enough anything? Victoria Australia went lockdown 100 days cases peaked 700s. see sorry lockdown much. wonder long term plan is?  Feel sorry 99% got paywalled. Idk I've seen bunch articles contradicting horrible science knowledge know believe. Yeah, I'm glad one family lost job lock downs. considered essential. reason lose jobs would never able recover financially. unemployment forces wait pay period pay you. Losing single check would default us somewhere we'd never make payment back. We'd fall behind 1000+ dollars expected pay bills without money it. three months late messaging changed much nobody knows what's going nobody cares.

This government disappointing. you’re making excuses? good chunk loud vocal minority bots. looting, therefore increased spread! Fact! complaining. Vodka drank taste chicken tastes like it, I'd never eat chicken add this, work FIFO remote region large indigenous population (still within QLD home state). locked away work March-June prevent spread local communities. Since June allowed catch chartered flight week, also provided POC antibody tests (10 min finger prick blood tests), boarding flight. 
The March-June lockdown federal government decision, state. 48% secondary schools either sent year groups students home positive cases. cases secondary schools far outstrip primaries, good.

Attendance lot schools &lt;85%. normal year would considered appalling even case intervention Ofsted.

Teenagers pretty rubbish social distancing suspect lockdown nature largely pointless. Bozza blame teenagers teenagers. he'll sudden change heart pull another U-turn two weeks. Even worse, shooting foot given proper advice multiple renowned medical experts. Admittedly read title, I’m responding title BS. People uneducated thing spreads, don’t even care learn, they’re obviously wrong things don’t even know they’re it. That’s don’t know got it. video camera exposure experience, could easily identify got it. broke one four basic rules. What’s insane think article article used study. anything trump throwing pandemic plan?? bet fucks still allowed hunt though. Testing SD Biosensor antigen nasal swab tests. Oh bore off. government completely inconsistent restrictions, u-turns every opportunity.  heard too. sleep apnea bit sensitive disposition indigestion. I've started eating much smaller time window (around 10am 7/8pm) water morning coffee outside window I've use Rennie's 5 weeks since starting it. Still eat sugar cut back particularly 4/5pm onwards. Good results far!  Rise up, Italy! March Rome! could spread virus sanitized properly dodged bullet! Imagine kid tossed simple “this” in...

“Is **this** stupid boss? Think used blow birthday candles close range everyone eating piece cake. it, too. even *that* practice changes result Covid, tiny silver lining. like idea dedicated candle-holding cupcake specifically blowing on, (if custom must practiced all), cake somewhere safely out-of-range. That’s necessarily true. strong immune system easily cause cytokinesis storm. Haha, good one 👍 Cytokine response. big problem Spanish flu well. Body goes drive, essentially wiping organs. us tutted quite loudly. Sure! come :) say Maine, that's wicked gross! best thing wear disposable gloves every time go supermarket.

Another really germy surface gas pump handles, beware. article says laat long What's view sheep? think look better lipstick? British equivalent Stephen Miller frank, unlike SARS, high temp/fever least symptoms ppl covid. Loss smell/taste respiratory symptoms better indictator know virus. Anyway mask limit spread, either others others unlucky asymptoms. rough seeing family friend east go lockdown. Hopefully join rest us soon enough! Yeah. Let's destroy economy make sure offend someone asking wearing mask. buy skis online. It’s unlikely you’ll going anywhere long time though might bit pointless. 1. day - 2 581 113 tested citizens, 25 850 positive (1%) Schools, factories, open. 

A locked UK open parte US. I’ve got Pfizer vaccine, far good. 🤞 fair, large scale indoor gathering recent (though don’t intend wear mask I’m sick COVID gone Yeah that's perfectly fine. sick really crowded areas, that's good enough. one's realistically asking wear masks everytime go pandemic. Went Merry Hill shopping centre Midlands Friday. 3/5 people wore masks got passed lurch door enforcing masks. 

Who would thought teenagers would reservations following loosely enforced rules. Nothing said sounds anything like conclusion you’ve drawn, fact you’re almost non sequitur territory there. alternative suggest then? Please advise us. Ok well weak immune systems exist you’re trying deny existence  It’s enforced though. people live good plenty people use exemption bullshit excuse. “lockdown” (it’s lockdown) nothing video needs Yakety Sax. I’m reading sorry consensus it’s extremely rare atm man data doesn’t support statement especially increasing studies immunity longer lasting Good thing schools gotten two week autumn holiday Belgium instead normal one week. I'll feel safe two weeks now.
I'm gonna prepare online classes, make courses projects socialize friends discord Virtual reality. Boris looked public eye said nothing wrong.  Cummings juicy dirt boris sure. work healthcare, contact someone knew positive (they tested procedure).

1. thought people testing would tell &amp; didn’t mention it.

2. told supervisors, said monitor symptoms continue work.

3. responded with, “That’s...that seems straight crazy!” told followed infection control guidelines nothing worry about.

This type idiocy part reason Texas winning stupidity. Damn can't go shopping skis. 

But can: 
Go work. 
Go home. 
Send kid school. 
Look friend's reletive's kids. 
Shop whatever Tesco wants sell me. 
Get Maccies drive thru. 

My life ruined. Boris fuck right off,this indecisive buffoon driving country even bigger shithole necessary realise Europe impossible position right now? don’t see need ashamed. I’m 24 gone back college education; entire class someone contact someone else, 5 confirmed cases college lot classes off. First time, area wasn’t affected much all. time it’s way way worse blame company, government. It’s gov’s fault can’t wfh. said still close bars restaurants...

My point situation less dangerous small house get-together, yield restriction likely pretty low. that’s wild. Lol Durham near Scottish border. need drive another hour half hit Scotland! country taken stupid. live UK here. long distance relationship planning travel home propose girlfriend November going take holiday would continue working there. Would still allowed travel? Give weeks. People don’t die instantly it.  city fun halloumi better. Hold tight stay safe, hopefully see everyone soon.🤞 need work borders massive piss up. God wish mention people maths worked car would needed stop least twice petrol journey flu never killed scale. pandemic hasn’t around one year yet. 

Any questions? Georgia. Nobody wears masks follows precautions here. Please help American confused, thanks! da real Great Briatinainer actual job critical. I'm admin assistant company training team, exactly critical times. Bro, stayed home 3 Halloween parties first time life.

Understand strive personal accountability enforce understanding population behaviors control. policy take account selfish fucks inevitably live among us bad one. I'm sure loud seems. dissenting opinion always get coverage. Journalists outnumbered protesters misguided takeaway number reasons. First, US 6x testing rate India. time India’s record even that, months record much, much that. India slightly higher positivity rate well. Second, cases remotely accurate representation actual number infected, difference immeasurable. story early 1 man India tested positive, 40,000 suspected cases shortly within city. sufficient resources test hardly time, symptomatic cases. 

Swine flu: 30,000 U.S. citizens test positive first year, CDC later estimates 60,000,000 US citizens infected first year, 200,000% disparity. 1 billion estimated globally first year. 63% global population estimated 2019. approved vaccine available 6 months times. Also notable fact North American South American people died higher rate people outside Americas completely unknown reasons, similar COVID. 

Obviously covid tested much higher rate, think people still drastically underestimating scale going here. Billions people almost certainly going infected, India likely hit hardest, likely hit hardest. Looking case numbers alone may diffuse public interest giving foreign aid may desperately need coming months. say you’re anti COVID like saying you’re anti oxygen. It’s thing matter think happening even don’t like it.  Jesus. botched abortion federalist system Italy happened. Government publish many executive orders wants, regional local authorities pretty much whatever want. Sometimes good way, closing even harder, since many local authorities opposition party thick headed, opposite also happened. Even inside opposition parties one page anything apart ""the government everything wrong"". 

Cities go regions say, regions go government says, fascists idiotic always protesting mask without ounce self-awareness etcetera etcetera. Makes sense something evolved like would protect group people evolved allowing passed on. Probably illegal. remember Fed Gov pursuing hard. [Relevant comedy enter buildings people within 8 hrs buildings others time you? agree. think primary low risk hard home remotely, also biggest impact people still work. Secondary, think maybe reduce number days (to support practical science activities etc), compulsory mask wearing support project work/ online classes. University (for lectures) done remotely mixing practical subjects. guys deserve fires. hope rest 2020 calms Australians enjoy fruits hard fucking work year starts changes world Since deaths usually lags 2 weeks behind cases, reasonably seeing increased death now. look this. Article years old still Aussie! Aussie! Aussie! tactic. Leak press gauge reaction go ahead change needed, depending public opinion. think type masks replace n95s since provide better fit. learning immune system works, stopped talking weak strong. That's muscle maximum force, hyper-multi-dimensional, stateful thing. Yup. whole milk helps vitamin absorption. 

Also, amount put milk tiny. recent research shows need 10 times previously thought. like US too. Like less 10% milk fat, called frozen dairy desert something cant called ice cream. 

I imagine lemonade doesnt enough sugar, probably lemon juice. Don’t worry, next fire season weeks away starting! consensus time. literally said nothing refutes comment. like say. wrong dude. Bingo, hidden surprise packet. generation retire early due incapacitations? choose 1 year pain foreseeable 20yr pain guess.

We *know* right now, I'm hoping like hell we've got right 'watch wait' mode. Sound like hospital dropping ball, infuriating. least got PCR test instead rapid misses lot positive cases unless actively sick. many days exposure test? maybe that's increasingly, everywhere virus highly contagious most. let government get control, America. Question: elderly family member think gonna leave money? Don’t forget Halloween White Castle? Asking mate Kumar. I'm mistaken schools still gonna open super spreader children west, could also mean living quite literally middle desert middle nowhere. Temp checks find shit. 

We temp checks work. people sit cars sun waiting shift, fail. minutes later, they're fine. temp drop, get sent home ordered get test. 

Meanwhile, sick March never developed fever. fever ME, temperature never rised level fail temp check. would infecting people, multitude symptoms. Fortunately office group working home time try spread people out.

Even false positives, would better temp checks. Positives would get sent standard test. would able come back work couple days, pay time out. Same, fucking insane. roommate keeps going bars parties. I'm work I'm isolating room away him. stuff like since April far, every ""huge invention"" pretty much useless. Loss smell taste strongly associated Covid, assume positive, isolate notify close contacts past two weeks go get tested. Good luck. I'm self isolating regardless. Yes. That’s correct. Lower population would mean lower test numbers. That’s it’s extraordinary TX passed CA - fewer people, fewer tests, positives.

Worst odiea drive places.  so? guy total shithole somehow believes country handling situation better UK, first world country. Lol okay dude well consensus moment definitely it’s rare o_o people think funny? see every time Texas mentioned. Somebody create r/Coronaviruscirclejerk dumbed way think counties=sheriff city=police department. country divided States, divided counties. county usually contains multiple cities areas ""unincorporated"", meaning part county particular city. main differences, get details find different overlapping enforcement law enforcement responsability, get picked (elected vs. picked Major) many ofher things. Yes stupid Americans. know list pick but, think fairly safe say that, although tried, they've deemed unsuccessful.

What list? tried? 

Clearly read neither comment linked articles.  There's already lot good replies this. two biggest things come mind are

1. General attitude population. There's less people Australia get crazy rights (completely forgetting rights come responsibilities)

2. politicians viewed pandemic fight. tool could use gain.

There's lot detail nuance left otherwise post would several encyclopaedias long point. everything else stemmed two things. sake stockmarket

Your job isnt risk lost assume? Hmm honestly interesting theory. think viral load culprit here? sad watching reports Chinese people arriving Korea get better understanding really happening China. much accurate dataset. Like car race track. Corners open straightways allow acceleration except final corner final lap. seemingly race predetermined lap count end.

Not race fan kind pardon lack insightful terminology. Maybe parents multiple children age 7? Africa seems done quite well overall. rounding corner, soon cure Chinavirus. Tremendous! Exactly! know Republicans wear masks consistently. also various science fields definitely voting Trump.  again, bad apples going ruin everything rest us. someone ground - said day announcement wouldn’t lock down. u turn u turn facebook still thing? masks, hand washing, keeping distance, keeping things generally clean, haven’t even gotten cold year. It’s nice. forget jared kushner mark Meadows. I'm surprised consequences 2. agree experience  Construction management fine, construction industry fairly big well protected. Depends you’re actually though, I.e. foreman vs project manager etc Enforcement made mandatory country’s leader. Someone stand us people corporations/businesses. People suffering. fix corporations business. can’t fix dead people. Although don’t agree protestors. recent March thousand much expect someone minimum wage imo. I've worked shops sucks, want start confronting shoppers potentially get spat punched placed bets trump fires reasons, I'd absolutely broke. Comedian enters chat... Let's hope so. 


But I'm sure. percentage positives still remains same, smaller number absolute numbers means fewer people tested. even Slovakia it. New world leader guess. Yeah heavily pro lockdown even admit end getting severe fatigue it, especially random outbreaks happened along way. broadly applies western europe. yet going rails moment.

the weather, particularly abundance sunshine, biggest factor. That’s good hear. nut baggery suck lot air. kids basically parents say 

...

I literally wrote day 5 year old started school year, told ""dont hug anyone"" (he's hugger). came back told hugged everyone.

There drunk guy driving car dudes there, also went store in.

Meanwhile, deciding get, earshot saying. 

He got packet cigarettes spoke cashier.

He said ""You know Corona virus load bollocks right? I've people complaining it, nothing serious, little cough"".

The cashier even bother acknowledge statement thankfully, left spoke cashier started talking comment, said confirmed bed-bound week.

She pissed guy said nothing, want hassle arguing him. That's handy people spouses countries yet citizens.  
 
We exactly lot flights heading anywhere either. see parents afraid let children alone. let alone house since age 7, pretty much age we're talking (school age?) Came say this. entirely non reciprocal. Cruise lines weren’t far behind awesome thanks Amazing masks do. 

Hilarious people opposed wearing dumb realize masks exactly get back normal. Misread. ok. WITNESS ME! 10 days Hong Kong (seemingly) China didn't. friend warning virus back December. Saying visit China, first time family skip new year, offered mail masks, etc etc. 

Externally, China may bullshitting rest world, internally dealing best could.  Yes indeedy, *four* autoimmune diseases caused virus — doctor idea one. 

Once immune system starts this, keep up: MS bag tricks. I’ve spared one, rheumatoid arthritis ... far 😣

First ate thyroid ... HOLD FUCK bizarre move, five states sent *known infected people* nursing homes, forced facilities house them. Including NY. bed shortage military hospital hundreds beds sat virtually unused time period.

This absolutely must investigated trail goes cold. sure President would fire him, I’m guessing statements like one don’t help. horrifying consequences. No. yourself?  Lack mental health services healthcare. tried leave candy driveway. little fucker knocked bowl broke Halloween decoration. Hell that. We'll keep candy home. Nottingham 2 universities current one hottest spots map. 

They need close schools. So, it’s lockdown, another half-arsed half-measure.

Saying “essential” business remain open, labeling fucking hair salons, golf courses part group defeats purpose. depends. sheep australia eat alive. Yep. I’m teacher Michigan. kid class test positive, I’m considered close contact. Also kid tests positive Monday morning, one class considered close contact contact people within 6 feet student 15 consecutive minutes within 48 hours test. It’s infuriating. Canada struggled testing too. test anyone unless directly flew another country mid-summe many areas, huge backlog limited testing sites September back-to-school hit. Hundreds people lined 8 hours testing sites, results took 10 days come in. better now, damn. put sign local pin pads:

West think shit, clearly lot middle income lower income countries way effective technocratic governance virus clearly show it. Rare see country West serious this. Well done Slovakia. dont know exact science behind that, probably infectious 14 days anymore. Honestly, still dont know scenario example decide go testing today, also dont want attend secound round, many days ""free"". need mention also, go nearest grocery store, even without negative test. get digging graves, travel warnings, whitehouse didn’t allow that.

I guess amount money made really pushed Big Pharma hard time. MERS way deadly spread fast enough become pandemic vaccine going truly worth pursuing. 

Hope everything goes well then. love propaganda Well fits line reports timing Oxford vaccine people gov't/NHS Why? Enforcement Police job, could posted around supermarkets hospitals necessary places numbers cut austerity-only-for-the-poor-brigade year year studies based around single-exposure events. studies repeated exposure works. time two exposure long enough, immune response first infection should, part, prevent second. That’s good point. would interesting see deaths state after, what, June 1st? Lol said hundreds millions doses vaccine (technically even fails vaccine LOL) we're 99.99 percent statistically get objected proved wrong feel lost

If like staying indoors, guest.  real sign one made article? anyone know? can’t find image article caption. Imagine throwing away valuable medical knowledge NYU someone made typo preprint. flown New York twice last 2 months. refused fill questionnaire it. get fined, get arrested. Basically nothing happened Also American here. credit cards contractless chip them, stores accept it. NYC area. you? I’m fairly certain there’s combination things spurring latest outbreaks Europe. slight mutation virus studied determine whether it’s infectious. strong case far. Also, current situation result reducing restrictions. Lockdowns absolutely worked strong evidence it. asked:""Did see articles saying protests cause mass outbreaks covid, even though virtually social distancing going on?""

I said I've seen both. 47 states 50 currently rise best, spiking worse. shouldn’t use national strategy 3 states ok? Fuuuuck that. bet pay enough deal shit like that! already sacrificed, that's problem. know historical revisionism popular around here, Americans highly compliant March-June government set back wasted time. Compare Asian governments shutdowns compared US government tell blame lies solely American citizens. lot less it’s lost virus spending, let alone decreased tax revenue. remember antibody tests claimed IgG specificity 98%, later determined independent validation actual specificity 92%. I'd always take manufacturer claim grain salt. Especially rushed large scale testing conditions far perfect lab conditions.

In place nearby 6 positive 2677 tested. tell you? Either tests extremely insensitive given samples (community without major outbreak even PCR tests need higher RT) , prevalence low even tests 99.7% specificity precise enough.

Large scale tests like seem waste money effort. Instead focus repeated consistent testing highly affected regions, using tests actually make sense. vaccine, peer-reviewed paper, case. simple. want troll me, least creative. Otherwise, bye. true, would explain Japan relatively high case loads (very tested, percentage tests coming back positive high) little deaths. Considering times go store like Target something, people strolling around chin-bra's ""drinking Starbucks"" wear masks face. workers also cover noses, around chin. What's point? Correct, aymptomatic cases accounted *confirmed* case. 

According latest guideline(http://www.nhc.gov.cn/jkj/s3577/202009/318683cbfaee4191aee29cd774b19d8d.shtml). still required go mandatory 14-days quarantine medical facility. discharged move 14-days home-isolation two negative RNA test within two days, two follow-up check two weeks four weeks. develop symptom, welp...  It’s vaccine “ready” essentially already building blocks vaccine SARS MERS. much funding put trying find vaccine prevalent, never needed since burned out. COVID happened took building blocks already started research vaccines repurposed towards COVID instead. Essentially half made vaccine finished. SARS COVID extremely similar viral structure wasn’t hard them. Another party?! Jesus, Quebec easy enforce flights, hotels, airbnb, campgrounds, etc. 

For family visits, people property NY enforceable. precious restrictions gaps. oh sure, see case. that's commenting on. Masks look kind lame....but pair one hoodie....suddenly look badass! summer, bandana also badass. country purposely withholding funds incentivize us go back work. guess who, strategy rhymes ""bird impunity."" Doctors see suspected covid case? til Yea, figured that’s meant, wasn’t explicitly stated pandemic **only** took stupid, would vote PM Dude... WW2 deaths period 4 years. 

We covid 7~8 months. 

Let sink in!! need watch Coco. believes newness virus also means seasonal changes normally decrease viral spread less impactful. Human immune systems familiarity COVID-19, said, might summer, typically less friendly environment viruses, didn’t squelch pandemic. study notes virus spread effectively environments ranging India’s monsoon season winter Wuhan.

Every fucking expert keeps saying 1) No, weather impact spread significantly, 2) ""novel"" virus, clue how's going get data.

Are expert? degree virology? not, provide studies, reports scientific information showing weather playing important role? talking yer arse? Lol fuck dude mad i'm right rumor UK could similar fashion. country back sort ""normal"" least months. first wave basically eliminated states.

Worst hit Victoria, even government giving payments people work payments business keep water. economy shit expected event like this. Get really tired ""lockdowns kill economy"", sure know else kills economy? mass death people afraid out. Huh. makes sense. Thank explaining. limit testing.  wife flying New England week, order check hotel needed negative COVID test within 72 hours.  call doctor clinic say need test (I give reason), scheduled within next hours.  

My wife calls say needs test we're traveling state. nurses *immediately shut down*, refused test saying that's ""a frivolous reason"".  wants test pay pocket (we well insured) $300. 

Because large doctors office, COVID phone line different people answer. wife hung up, called back asked get test, never said travel. immediately scheduled within hour insurance paid it.  guess TLDR somewhere medical/industrial/complex they've told nurses give anyone test. highly doubt shortages too. fighting El Paso lockdown even tho ICU 100%.

Episode III: ? Oh yeah it’s beautiful that’s kinda vibe I’m looking terms people. Wear masks. I’ve read article several times, seems kind vague point. Maybe it’s I’m giddy extra hour DST. Here’s part addresses it, maybe I’m missing it:

And coming Cd. Juarez going hospitals Cd. Juarez?

What? even know effective yet I'm saying reasons deceptive I'm going trust someone history deception either. I'm sure Fauci believed right thing personally find knowingly giving poor health advice completely unethical. line crossed.

Also even good reasoning part. people infected, masks needed. Deception leads infected nothing help ppe supplies overall. agree, people don’t luxury, agree people luxury go wander get house. place work never busy I’m sure don’t see many people someone works Walmart I’m lucky shoot patient wount count infected anymore though... Yeah like definitely bad messaging every time gets brought reddit people still using excuse forgoing masks. excuses. everyone time rigorously investigate source. That’s rely journalists digest information us. suggested American media tried destroy reputation disagrees scientific consensus herd immunity, masks lockdowns. 

This last line story. Always playing victims sycophants. amazing mental gymnastics people use ""discredit"" experts.

""I regret anything said context time said it, correct. told task force meetings serious problem lack PPEs masks health providers putting harm's way every day take care sick people,"" Fauci told O'Donnell. 

""When became clear infection could spread asymptomatic carriers know they're infected, made clear strongly recommend masks,"" said.

""And also, soon became clear enough protective equipment cloth masks homemade masks good masks would buy surgical supply stores,"" Fauci added.

He's yelling since May mask up, supports mask mandate, praises Biden mask usage. data open. hiding. read add yourself. may offer counterpoint public health person - agree likely enforceable, provide people guidance norms interstate travel safely. making policy, though unenforceable, probably makes people take concept seriously. Testing three days advance travel smart - close enough travel gives enough time get test back, hopefully bringing virus New York spreading travelers. know lot people going two week quarantine, wait get test fourth day (so caught virus traveling time show test), hopefully catch cases otherwise would have. perfect? course not, better people deciding 14-day quarantine impractical fuck it. traveling holidays halfway decent approach lower risk others. poster Swedish even country? I'm seriously considering relocation myself, see change leadership soon  means texas managed exceed ca fewer tests, issue even worse. since would need way higher positivity rate (Thus cases missed tests) gop love russia.. see trump Ah, yes, pushed highly-developed cities settlers took infrastructure. /s

Folks like complain 3rd world bubbles exist came be. Yell ""victim blaming!"" good job, really helped natives. since anti-mask beginning pandemic, see reason trust him. I'm going trust someone **back April** 

&amp;#x200B;

your link literally explains why.

it's also precisely public ***STILL*** can't go hardware store get box N95's.

&amp;#x200B;

**So, told wear masks beginning?** reason concerned public health community, many people saying this, **were concerned time personal protective equipment, including N95 masks surgical masks, short supply.** wanted make sure people namely, health care workers, brave enough put harm way, take care people know infected coronavirus danger getting infected."" silly think know that. Science based verifiable facts, feelings. beginning science established mask use. is. He's consistent since spring wear masks. Meanwhile Trump still equivocating. guys kiwis seem sensible western countries get shit down. proud yourself. Madrid long weekend decided lockdown 3 days. back normal. 

Because confined 3 days going make big difference. duration around

Breath analysis proprietary new. Besides, know whether analysis processes same? Singapore technique seems yielded much better results, based articles linked years vs 3 months there

Not relevant month vs Q1 next year

Source ""ready month""? September. Sounds like sales piece. I’m sure cause is, culture America quite different countries. stand close one another, speak loudly, touch, hug... cultures give personal space, generally. I’d guess may factor extent. time id make edit confuse people never heard real eagle sounds like watch angry comments stack video. Trump declared pandemic over. incorrect. Anything less 1% age 70 acceptable opinion. Anything less 10% acceptable 70. 

The question really many, potential alternative outcome? gambling future planet saving elderly clearly worth it. 

To put things perspective, great depression arguably led WW2, thus killing 85 million people 2.3B tot. 3% earth's population dies coming WW3 political economic instability talking 210 million dead people, young. Covid-19 killed 1.2m worldwide, large majority old people, numbers could potentially double vaccines even 2.4m 7 billion people nothing. 2015 140m people born 55 million people died, excess mortality 4.3% (2.15% currently) nothing zoom personal losses.

So big mistake scale healthcare we've months prepare, able give healthcare everyone needs age 80, weak short-term minded politicians want gamble failure need save face. That's mechanism direct viral clearance cells...to eliminate infected cells. might want read immune system works. Try Kuby's. Spanish Flu did. Fauci, [thousands expert civil fired ""disloyalty"" regardless election's outcome. one way pricks attempt sabotage next administration. One lung disease can't wear mask one vulnerabilities like diabetes wear mask free open relationship partner need wear one. also secretly wants dead. state facts. pity think propaganda. guess people everything like propaganda. Smart, really. boss want, sometimes gotta go head *his* boss. That's get though. Thousands die flu year- whyare people dismissing implimenting actions save like covid? Coronaviruses mutate less flu... mean thought stopped caring science. Half counter doesn’t believe science anymore, Fauci even job still Probably legal permanent residents visa holders too. Keep coping. China fine now. 

Also save ""China lying number"" crap please. friends families China first hand experience things progressed since last year.  lab conducting test.

Here US seller's mask. someone goes bathroom, pees, also slips finger beneath mask nose itching. Infected finger. Puts mask back classifies decent citizen abiding rules.Comes out, touches doorknob. 

They study once. Tested bacteria shit testing water containers, like water bottles people's office desks. actually contained it. gotta wonder easy imagine. Lack proper hygiene.

Well, intestines kilogram bacteria drink shit might get upset stomach end that.

People wear masks one looking pick noses, scratch asses knows else. mask mean much actually behaving like well-trained medical pro.  Even shared design ideas, data R&amp;D phase, Singapore get product faster, still patent receive credit it. cruel fact. I'm sorry data support emotions feelings. PhD microbiology/immunology. I've infectious disease research 3 decades academia industry. Media (paid goverment ofc) making protests bigger really are. 

They coverage images of, usually young people (they need someone blame), burning trash bins, throwing rocks running away looting 2 shops (One deacthlon one lacoste shop seen news far away massive lootings protests want us belive happening.)

Also next news are: young man ICU 20 ish 10 days went party... infected people 17-26 years. Yeah. Nothing like free press. 

90% news lies scare people justify hard lockdown coming. Agreed. districts resources manage better others. federal state responses terrible cases. Texas person state mandate.

I also agree it’s better kids. kids stuck home online since March mental health issues become real. still are, even weird, masked, distanced school environment helped them. PE alone helped. Texas PE outside. daily exercise really made difference them. seeing friends teachers like (lol maybe even ones don’t like). Slovakia testing whole population weekend without negative test government issued certificate cant go work, shop nature places.. wanna switch us?!  Better sick *of* shit sick *with* shit though, eh? 
Stay safe. Wait, golf? sport stand huge field miles away anyone else maybe friend two use clubs ball?  I'd obviously agree much better source Trump's radiologist. since anti-mask beginning pandemic, see reason trust him. I'm going trust someone back April telling people reason wear mask United States. Undoubtedly people dead followed advice. wait studies confirm washing hands helped obvious, like obvious masks work. RECOMENDATIONS ( restrictions) essentially said people 70 extra careful visiting stores using public transport. make prisoners draconian. anything Sweden accused thinking much elderlies mental health freedom. 

There punishment police recomendations based fact risk group. 

You loose definition lock up, prison draconian must say.

Please show restrictions talking about? Sadly, think right. starting envy beloved young relative mine enough permanently relocated saner country. informs relief incredible. calmly wear masks pay attention experts there. get tested many have, certain ""lockdown"" measures apply gotten test. Like example supermarket (and possibly should, I'm sure that) deny entry certificate negative test (please, keep yellow star comments yourselves, we've heard enough neo-nazis past week) elderly / child / disabled.  Fauci repudiates Atlas moronic ideas detail JAMA interview. Thanks. need confess, I'm layman, I'm expert topic :-) ""they"" people government, misinterpreted statements regards testing.

Maybe reference point overall success identification person infected? even PCRs low success rate certain stages infection overall think would 50-55% 30% Coronavirus separated critical thinkers jackasses crooks. you’re able see you’re smarter ~40% US population ethical elected leaders really think media likes running stories reinfection scares people gets clicks, bad none fears based infectious disease scientists doctors saying long term immunity. dont tell friends police fair say quite time. Louder people back! Ireland fatalities among schoolchildren yet far know (definitely among school outbreaks), hand lot issues result closing schools. 

But mostly think worried unbearable long term winter (everything closed, cold dark, can't take children anywhere work hours), people would comply, huge risk vulnerable populations. Sure said **IF**. Also im 110% carefull went one around followed mine strict instructions. also dont need visit shops one month “dangerous” situation. know people follow instructions

Anyway see 2-3 weeks mass testing.

Also get situation next month? next one? dont enough tracking country testing every month dont change shit around here. seen next week politicians pat back next month make new regulations people still infected neither died recovered. Someone hospital 2 months considered “no outcome” either die recover [Meanwhile, Czech highest Italian per capita rolling average deaths ever, almost high Spanish peak. Oddly, lives improved.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Yeah im gonna say thats factual Right. Like, you’re going leave people assume get choose seeing friends/family outdoor distanced masks horseshit for... what? next two years? Forever? lot people going say way. cute amount ignorant non educated people here, ADORABLE. 

Don't worry guys, they've working VLA15 since April 2020, hydroxychloroquine one best treatments lyme, that's Trump even admitted using it. 

FYI, American, fuck trying make political, think asshat president accidentally revealed much telling people taking hydroxychloroquine.


Oh but, MRNA VACCINE NEVER MADE DER.

Do guys wanna know VLA15 going work? going use rabies transmit vaccine instead adjuvants. target protein, antigen, simply disappear bloodstream injected wholesale, vaccine must include delivery method. reason, vaccines use adjuvant chemicals, “a compound makes antigen stable immune system recognize it, see it, mount immune response,” Pal said.""""

But basic knowledge years, people fucking retarded reason need hear CNN youtube.


EDIT: FYI, step right direction could implications far reaching future. Also, none heard .... sure guys know fuck talking about. 

Whats sodium dichloroacetate? ....Have great night folks. Hope going home area healthcare system already strained. Gatherings among people generally careful probably one worst ideas right now. I'd make excuse.  Haha - indeed, delegate upwards. 

Note: made substantive argument spite claiming highly educated issue. actively infected, possibly going around infecting people what's equivalence US? can't sleep know that. Texas would top list states could lockdown. lot ""muh rights"" anti-mask people. depends city you/re in. large state varied demographics within it.. Cool story. evidence present thinking logically open mindedly?

You seem automatically rejecting germ theory disease claiming coronavirus doesn’t exist actually Lyme disease. explain cruise ship outbreaks? Lyme disease bearing ticks stowed away ships? doctors nurses infected treating hundreds patients also bitten ticks Covid wards?  aren't. guys seem based, fix coral bleaching Wow! Thanks!
I already started taking supplements occasionally since get loads sun exposure know much one. 
I reading do! know Trump accused paying someone take SAT him. know enough 2 lol.  went huge Halloween party last night! least 150 people there. one wore masks. one social distanced. felt normal. finally felt alive first time months. house must've jammed packed lol. Probably barely room move around. think absolutely right that, hope school remains safe. 

Whether it’s learning online person, almost seems like STABILITY reigns supreme. 

Anecdotally speaking well, schools unstable, kids staff getting sick, teachers living fear, guidelines ignored bended seem detrimental everyone involved. Since articles love shut whole place will. one first, first state March. ***I hope avoid time,” said.*** 

Meaning want another shutdown. see issue stating keeping plan table event shit hits fan Northeast.

I personally think NY's microcluster strategy much efficient sweeping shutdown, knows what's going happen result weekend. way many social media posts people large parties, maskless, drinking, etc. Essentially large amounts superspreader events occurring simultaneously. terrible history lol

Durrr 1930s Germany US perspective 


Why can’t use en masse open everything back up?  We’ve living thing US almost 7 months now, I’ve seen people beyond ready take whatever risks come return normal lives. Halloween neighborhood social media looked different year. Even 83-year-old grandmother begging come visit another state. doesn’t want spend last years life (or least last truly mobile years) sitting house. She’d rather risk getting COVID that. 

It seems like every day people get tired waiting vaccine decided potentially deadly virus risk they’re willing take, vaccine not. wear bad boy what? Like 48 hours change filter! kn95 mask one day like central Illinois myself, absolutely maddening. fight people work day think hoax serious whatever, infuriating. Times, might found knowledge odd, feel respect admiration PPE fashion sense. Thátš ńót réálly hélpfúl could focus point making instead fixating completely irrelevant detail. 70% mortality rate 75+ Sorry. thought referring US govt. post saying US govt left states. comment US govt. I'm sure AUS fed state worked together better US fed state.  Older people recovered well too. Many fact. Vast majority fact. Pretty much. shut whole place will. one first, first state March. hope avoid time,” said.


Cue half state begining self impose.

And half planning protests going now. Making things worse lockdowns become necessary easy fall confirmation bias. scientific articles suggesting coronavirus virus rather side effect lyme bacteria solar radiation? paper reporting misdiagnosis scientist saying disease originally thought causing symptoms exist. release info People die everyday superman. nearly that... blows mind since remember reading news day finished mapping human dna first time. Going article appears well 100K New Yorkers moving else first time state “locked down” results excellent. It’s reopening plan needs avoided planned differently. fail see leg disagree Fauci stand point. garbage that's spewed Atlas empirically false. Herd immunity 10%? people already immune? reason test anyone that's old?  insanity. Large scale lockdowns U.S. over. won. stop trying kill even people hold vaccines treatments. People love shitting US covid response compare another countries level infection US allows people see severe is. Except encouraging following precautions. They're tweeting precautions, like masks particular, work. time they're strongly recommending CDC, unlike Atlas headed someone actually confirmed Congress. WH spokesman explicitly said masks work think discourage compliance ethereal idea compliance fatigue. 

The people say 'fuck that' good excuse keep truth reasonable people deserve representatives. Otherwise represented. They're herded. Wait Olympics GBR, Northern Ireland isn’t included? really start refusing treatment people willfully ignored safety protocols.

What's that, refuse wear masks? went large party comply social distancing? bad, deserve treatment. People need learn actions consequences. We're running low space hospitals, let's waste healthcare providers' time space selfish trash frankly deserve face repercussions COVID. PCR tests likely this. search even one molecule virus. doesn’t mean infected, came contact virus point. going wear mask forever avoid every little non Covid germ virus.

I think wearing mask forever, rather cold flu get out, wear it. gesture done many Asian countries even pre-covid. USA currently 6.4% tests coming back positive, however states much worse conditions - North Dakota 50%, example. See Comparison: new cases past 14 days/100k population.

Do know hydroxychloroquine one best treatments lyme disease...

EDIT: Learn put pieces together, learn discard pieces become irrelevant proven scientifically unfactual. COVID masterpiece Chinese funding lies. Everyone clammering good ol Chinese research funds atm, know United States working Lyme vaccines atm, etc. Like VLA15, etc. Trump admitted took hydroxychloroquine, because... Well, still 100% concluded anything, never am, always research anything everything consider unfactual misrepresented thats scientists do, perfect, perfection horrible idea nothing beyond it, growth, advancement, must admit thing perfection, able understand understand lines. best guess wanted release announcement/article quickly possible, wait get details complications least governors authority. Tony Evers literally can’t anything. Stay home order? Struck down. Limits gatherings? Struck down. Mask mandate? They’re fighting speak (and know “they” is). unfollow twitter, begging people stay home getting sad. Trump, person top, nothing, mocked people wearing masks. Gentleman picture excellent taste PPE :)

That's 3M 6502 7093 filters, reference. According data worldometers Texas passed California reported cases Oct. 21. yeah, true week cases currently rising quite lot faster Texas California. Hawaii sent dozens people jail breaking rules. People skeptical anonymous Covid reporting apps already. stands chance meaningful adoption. What's point comments titles 'equal x US cases' countries reveals numbers? care US what's equivalent US. every post comments like this. lol

I family NY they’re staying put. “The definition insanity thing expecting different results” I've worn mask around 11 hours one time mine never got wet damp? use surgical masks, matters.  Approved health authorities January. We'll ignore countries approved decide full month long review required here. Canada also late table purchase vaccines. bunch countries vaccinated Canada. Great, rewrite things read, arrogantly, ignorant. See! fact relatively young person peak physical condition survive clear evidence 100 million people 65 carrying underlying conditions U.S. nothing worry about!

-Daily thread brigade team know sub least, daily comments Fauci causing general anxiety (and CovidNewNormal anxiety). power, nobody really listening, doesn’t much contribute “Things aren’t good.”

Idk. wish power control say... It’s upsetting. winter going horrible. up, get way way worse.

Those us acting well along pretty close fuck territory. mean we'll wear masks &amp; social distance, we'll also people etc. Let's hope that's case, sadly nothing surprise going forward. You’re right— state several others, following metrics phases outlined “the plan” totally thrown window, favor following plan “whatever governor feels like”, obviously go far earning people’s trust are, I'm home personally. reason noone told encouraged stay home September everyone moved even though almost nothing happening uni itself. Unfortunately majority instances title changed, whackadoo shenanigans. causes coronavirus truly mystery man, it? 

/S last line. Oh Covid thats ACE2 agonist COVID tricks furin cleave cleavage site glycoprotein shuttle directly cells way pneumonic flus do? one ""apparently mimics HIV"" one apparently ""causes happy hypoxics"" one destroys heart blood vessels (oh like lyme!)......................................................................................................................................................................................................................


I believe COVID real, shit work BSL-4 labs would actually work, way real, biological weapon, anything, especially considering know coronavirus's general, infect humans, Sars 10 years ago fucking super rare, many people come contact many strains coronavirus especially handle wildlife way, deal type farm livestock. 

The largest class RNA viruses SUDDENLY made massive leap destroy humans? Nope, thing COVID real, corona rna viruses mutate pick components others extremely commonly, covid real lethal say, second wave would kill 200m+, third wave probably wiping entire planet. even real wave. 

I believe many compounding things occurring here. Coincidental also pumping money Lyme disease vaccines year like crazy every since April 2020. mafia never problem before. They’re freaking 100 cases, exact reason they’re top begin Yup. People keep bitching compliance parties Jazz...but really...if plan goal, don’t know people expected? goal strategy endgame, going people complying. Yeah avoid talking certain things certain friends vaccines go best bidder countries. Also single live alone. I'm terrified getting getting sick. one check me, one make food, call 911 me. Pretty sure cat can't trained things! also sucks cause people seem safe bubble family significant other. isolating right now. I've trying see friends safely, exposed working office public seem majorly slacked covid prevention recently. Add colder air I'm sure safe see again. sick everything much harder, especially comes form human contact. coming massive introvert!!! poor extroverts there! Covid also mutating quickly three get merits? Oh trust me, fortunate. Given cost side effect profile, can't understand anyone tolerates zinc supplements take prophylaxis.

There things start suspect exposure, like famotidine ivermectin. bottles zinc, D, C, quercetin &amp; melatonin sitting kitchen counter, every morning, case melatonin, every night. friend Facebook doctor reading travails helped take damned scourge seriously. people need watch Penn Teller's: Bullshit.

In one episode show hilarious delusion healing crystals length. 

Pretty much every episode gold though😁 think it’s exact opposite— saying “masks social distancing til 2022 regardless get vaccine” much likely get people say “fuck that” middle-of-the-road messaging “follow precautions til widespread availability vaccines spring 2021” No, ""flatten curve"". make sure peak less high. know Surely hospitals prepared first lock down?

Nope. all. like criticize arguments, least make sure right! Wdym? literally said “your point true” Yeah thats horrendous Sunday. Monday might lower like usual. Tuesday knows election. wouldnt surprised Thursday well 10k. Sweden Sad truth. People blatantly defy this, nothing done it. redditors Americans, young lol Yes, right social media China monitored, regarded potential source instability (and they're completely right). However, happened *after* they're reported situation, before. Even news Wuhan market closing January 1st news (even read it, says lot).

I've also really [bad social media due danger represent, sadly see way could also say covering undercounting number deaths Wuhan 10x

Are saying get number absolutely correct early days? course didn't, *nobody* did, certainly got handle crisis first. counted cases diagnostic hospital, death rate ~0.5-1%, get accurate real number case. intentional? course maybe using brain enough. country 1 billion people, virus spread without knowledge control least 3 months less total cases US today?

It's damn *exponential* growth. know unintuitive mathematical background, number case linear number population country, proportional time initial outbreak. quick response tracking determinant.
You can't compare US numbers (that NOTHING) Chinese numbers (that almost EVERYTHING). make sense. Look daily Chinese reports: outbreaks time time, confirmed cases practically *doxed* warn people might crossed official death toll sitting 4634 people least 5 months. find extremely unbelievable single person 1.5 billion died coronavirus past 5 months.

Again, many cases new outbreak? much (a hundreds most), low number death quite consistent quarantine/testing/tracking procedures. especially consistent consider high numbers deaths West happens medical infrastructure overwhelmed collapses. ""flatten curve"" slogan used past months? understand objective here?

Also, look South Korea numbers. They've barely done ""worst"" China proportionally population (they're ""worst"" comparatively recent outbreak, much less restriction population). realistic? ""lying communists"" clear, I’m American. couldn’t care less US government handled pandemic. make TV show I’ll first watch. sure air sequel another communist fuckup. one add pretty extensive list.

Well, we'll see. bet HBO series ever affront criticizing results Chinese government without blatant hypocrisy, West caught pants despite advanced warnings. state Illinois. matters lot. huge amount land land, water, traffic cultural barriers. European countries considered differently reasons states should. governors best state governors jack shit. makes huge difference. Eeek! mitigation efforts, mean. possible, please try avoid social gatherings especially parties. three, maybe Vietnam. Whether reported results accurate questionable. seems two shut down.

* canada 37 million people 3000/day selfishness stupidity, people different needs.

No, is. grown adults acting like children. (I'm American)

Honestly, that's big nope me. Socially acceptable, sure, be. soon bet I'm going throw fucking facemasks trash. I'm wearing 100% time I'm home (except driving alone), I'll continue still necessary. hate them. They're horribly uncomfortable forced switch contact lenses wearing facemask + glasses worst. day they're needed anymore beaten covid, completely drop feel good it. want shit end. field medic doesn’t know dick operating ventilator, extubate, know balloon blown, titrate pressors, initiate paralysis What's coming far worse beginning year, numbers double flu season. single study prospective looks lab-demonstrated cell immunity risk infection? seen good one role cell immunity preventing infection remains undefined. saw pictures one tabloid journals Finland sure seems like business usual. frankly, shopping centres look quite similar expect maybe 30% wear Shame you. ...no? It’s like functioning democracy, can’t really blame Russian people shit shitty leader does. Certainly blame enough I’d wish covid them!!  Many US states bad, example: Illinois 7k, US equivalent 192k. Wisconsin 5k, US equivalent 284k. Minnesota 3k, US equivalent 170k etc. locking people posting dissenting opinions online. low probability serious disease. live anyone. finally convinced family stop fucking asking go Thanksgiving. shop food, booze, pot &amp; office supplies. mask &amp; social distance like champ. 

So guess see issue. may eligible loan forgiveness funds used eligible payroll costs, payments business mortgage interest payments, rent, utilities either 8- 24-week period disbursement.

That period over. Whoopsie daisy indeed many times one get sick? I'm 18 last time got sick 12.

You need get checked get sick many times would say direct result anti-science for-profit enterprise. 

Viruses last concern global warming. Billions people living areas unlivable within 100 years. Also lie. Never heard anywhere.

I see number people suggesting deny services take precautions. Weird since many likely support universal healthcare otherwise.

Not ***next*** month. Give exponential growth 2-3 months unrestricted lockdowns everyone yet infected gets one month. Ya way keep 2024. vaccine lockdowns don’t work herd immunity going route. seriously understand obsession masks. 

They fucking suck. 

They limit breathing(i'd like fresh air)
They get wet disgusting runny nose sweat
Cant see shit glasses
I cant properly speak


I'm willing wear mask pandemic there's way hell wear one dont too.

I dont understand obsession dont stock mask companies. Thanks part problem. actually really really fuck America RT - Russia Today state media. blinded real not. 

You responded different thread insinuating 290 million people going catch COVID month. 

That’s insane.  state run testing sites using rapid tests instead PCR. ""antigen""? Also, I'm expecting negative test numbers increase rapid tests sensitive. Team nursing. Take nurses areas low census like elective surgery. help ICU nurses tasks ICU related. way ICU nurses take patients. used successfully COVID places.

I would never volunteer hospital nurse, nickel dime us enough top getting nice bonuses. might test coffin negative, although positive

Are trying say false negative? Pssst. ppl also love dumbest man history written language English. Might something economic issue, think people would happily stay get paid starve incredibly common themes. poorer nations much better richer nations. Early pandemic obviously due fewer travellers. However point, COVID everywhere world, it’s obvious better response protocols.

They recognize fragile society take threats seriously perhaps. West heads ass, thinking mask debate freedom. ""Army Twelve Monkeys""? People saying ties Chiiina like believe. case number threshold welding doors shut? isn’t exponential growth...because 290million people coming COVID next month. No.

For better worse there's 0% chance US another lockdown. take hydroxychloroquine Africa prevent malaria treat HIV/AIDS

Must coincidence lowest infection rate... ""You think going get next month?”

That's kinda exponential growth thing works. France lockdown mode, U.S need record high numbers coming weeks, even France. April again. Missed part can’t reduce employees pay 25% eh?

I’d say laying someone qualifies reducing pay 25%.

Woopsie daisy  also zero regard human rights means taking strict measures forcing people incredibly easy know one hold accountable. basically locked people inside homes months wuhan. Like literally locked, depend people outside food medicine online came certain moments UK cost £12.8 Billion can’t even test 15% population 7 month pandemic.
Please provide details UK Government. cheaper effectively current government don’t clue it’s doing. you’re recovered, wouldn’t go living normally possible? I'm taking virus seriously, want build sustainable control, needs take account people social nature legitimately suffering trying right thing. selfishness stupidity, people different needs. someone told allowed read year, would lose mind. clearer information research people asymptomatic? *It like COVID-19 DDoSing heatlhcare system.* fantastic! Bravo Scotland! denial adorable. mean indoor dining bars closed IL? That's fairly strict. Although Ive read places enforcing guess witnessed places enforcing it. melodrama perhaps? UK lockdown ""destroy"" generation's ""lives hopes dreams"" France also testing per capita tan U.S so... loan fully forgiven funds used payroll costs, interest mortgages, rent, utilities (due likely high subscription, least 60% forgiven amount must used correct, taxpayers government make money interest. banks made loans do. gone shut borders afterwards though? Czech Republic alone enough cases destroy entire effort. would good time go then? think that’s one hardest things virus. want get top act early seems evident action required. think one biggest reasons Australia (&amp; NZ) (as well closing international borders requiring hotel quarantine returning citizens). 

Most countries wait it’s pretty obvious something anything significant time virus infected many people continue spread restrictions start taking effect, generally takes couple weeks. 

I guess lucky ways shut March could see devastating could got control like Italy closing international borders meant able keep relatively (except outbreak Victoria) control since then. 

I’m really worried Europe USA heading winter Christmas season. think Japan quite big Halloween. lived far larger anything UK. 

In eyes USA Canada, countries acknowledge celebrate vicariously. spreading smaller personal gatherings would guess. ate outside last night people following rules. Walking dog later lots house parties shades pulled plenty noise talking. restaurants bars totally closed inside now! one's killing anyone. ""I 100 friends"" dont, friends arent Democrat god wish us. one's asked Fair point national guard since guardsmen always rotation let go repurposed. drawing conflict zones anyway. 

I think staff get done. 

Time tell. mispelled ""Republicans"", nice try nobody believes BS Latest reputable source saw 236,000+ deaths. :( Ok cool They’re actually ‘richest’

Here’s public companies free cash hand r/im14andthisisdeep Sweden worse neighboring countries still got hit economically. wrong:

1. People indoors, easier spread.
2. Lack vit D.
3. Flu prefers colder weather.

http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2014/the-reason-for-the-season-why-flu-strikes-in-winter/ friends tough come especially school they're significant others differences important. I'm struggling something similar guy, friend I've known 25 years. usually talk politics shocking learn leanings also questioned whether continue friendship values different. love I'm going let stupid dumb ass year take something else away me. I'm hoping step back bit pretend year never happened go back talking stuff disagree about. question flipped, low death rate would virus support lockdowns? yet someone threw party thousand people  230k way? Nobody knows flu seasonal. 

Sure do, 3 reasons:

http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2014/the-reason-for-the-season-why-flu-strikes-in-winter/ 230k already happened, lmao stereotypical reddit comment vaccine reduce symptoms reduce hospitalization least 80% considered success ban driving reckless ways endanger around driver. Drunk driving, reckless driving, speeding, vehicles roadworthy, driving without insurance, hell, even unnecessary acceleration. So, driving car becomes unreasonable risk car, ban driving car. Every person leaves home need posing risk everyone come contact with. Dining restaurant unnecessary allowed right now. Bypassing standard legislative process one. Uh, used panel words. Guess I’ll see happens 🤷🏽‍♀️ Rounding third home think we’d eradicated diseases now.

Infectious disease doctors immunologists shattered this. anyone think before?! it’s literally motto. It’s simple that. defeats point sarcasm, idiot Like what? Remember 1968 viral pandemic killed millions worldwide also primarily affected young people yet still held Woodstock festival pathetic lemmings comprehend life risks

What happened us? Nobody even wears masks southern Illinois church services. Nobody cares. nervous friend’s having.... 8. 

Instead 6. would never gone 1000 person party. Ever.l rank 26th deaths/capita 45th overall deaths. rank 47th terms states population size. Covid. Panic. *banned idiots* easily startled, they'll soon back, greater numbers Science consists spread one virus. social science? science human nature? Economics? Psychology? 

When people say “stand w/ science” “trust experts” (particularly relation lockdown measures), picture someone sits home, studying covid charts watching Dr. Fauci—while failing consider scientists medical experts findings. live nursing home? They'd fewer cases czech much keep deflecting... wonder why? Also please quite projecting fact sad person imitating infectious expert coronavirus subreddits it’s pretty obvious already bypassing laws amendments? would less legal targeted specifically potential danger? think two options following guidelines exactly unchecked spread.

Of course there's options. even sure pretend otherwise lol suddenly China beacon truth, despite origin virus first place. agree going come go goes everyone may come go forever.

I lot investing research.

In therapeutic world I'm awaiting RLF-100 come inhaler form. believe happens become something live like common cold we'll decent treatment.  Central Europe, actually. quit one year. Best find 2.5% US currently, even then, number dominated “at risk” people elderly, don’t see sense forcing vast majority significantly change lives lose businesses that. anyone ever laid viable plane ""focused protection"" allows people resume lives normal? cut contact vulnerable non-vulnerable without restricting even now? political bluffing? far safer get goods mail shop person? Lol, days never tell who's sarcastic not. awful lot people simply want consume resources without contributing society, much true. Again, son, position ask proof anything. Again, nobody. That's always life. Good thing people like rarely make power. 

This dumb. whole ""Americans stupid that's blame pandemic"" narrative getting really tiresome

unfortunately american exceptionalism cuts ways, guess true literally every communicable disease still bravely venture outside. Perhaps too, try get sun week. Scientists officials loyal bidding he’s president, might listen anymore he’s president anymore right thing Americans. would let touch vaccination. I'd rather take chances virus. sounds simple, yet logistics implementing timely safe manner would likely complicated. 

Who provides testing? pays testing? enforces mandatory quarantine? laws/amendments need violated/enforced actually enforce quarantine? too. Looks like weddings night clubs stay menu. I'm surprised orange one trying take credit somehow. complience high, sorry live. want low expectations people. look like they're clear brilliant news. Although ofcourse there's always chance could come back like NZ clear eventually covid cases again(although small). Either way good news 0 cases Still waiting provide evidence expertise. Also doubt someone 50-60 years old PhD arguing like Reddit lmfao going somewhere data. I’m sure use data longitudinally however (how many cases truly active, many people get sick line, many deaths line). That’s said, Slovakia probably tell us lethality disease. 25K found positive, know unfortunately number deaths 1-2 months. Everything else bit difficult draw conclusion Sturgis without beer. Yep. Thanksgiving, everyone brings home Last week ... people suffer severe depression. 

I’m sure people disagree, virus run course. Lockdowns prolong that, although necessary healthcare system going get overwhelmed. However, seems lot people think lockdowns cure. aren’t, never be. Sadly, we’re gonna deal works way world population. Stuff jails? China can't predict course virus. time could mutate become worse. That's make living so-to-speak.

Edit: Again, would dumbshit downvote simple fact viruses? trying suppress real information here? Remarkable graphic end article shows areas involved - keep scrolling thr picture description change. Interesting read, thank you. appears Antigen test 10% less effective, significantly faster. candidate mass screening. reason drop effectiveness requires higher viral load nose swab. ""essential worker"" highly interested COVID tests. lots people building getting noses poked, good testing shown help reduce spread, also nose swabs taking 48 hrs results area (unless hospital worker, 2 hours) It’s well known covid causes automatic certain death anybody goes restaurant. Mormaggedon? Doctors took pay cuts hospital. lost crap ton money stopping elective procedures. may stop winter. Sturgis 2.0 😣 hate truth. cant stand wrong thought thing nothing.

They want go parties give grandmas hug thanksgiving.

So downvote things make feel guilty wanting things. Whilst true extent also harder prove direction.

The closer numbers infections vaccine control 50:50 infections total need statistically significant vaccine effective certain threshold.

It's much easier confident vaccine works 32 infections control group, compared 21 control group 11 vaccine group. latter whilst point reached quicker, they'll likely wait longer infections sure vaccine actually effective deciding approve it. record coworkers' coughs turn in? Sturgis 2.0 😣 one say. Everything unprecedented. guess I'm optimistic we'll get vaccine sometime next year mask wearing social distancing probably carry till early 2022 start see whether vaccine works incase there's shortages etc Furthermore, US actually much fewer cops per person countries. European countries, police twice common. I’ll add another...

If you’re someone ignores health protocols pandemic end infecting even killing others, held criminally financially responsible. Well completely understand grandma coming from. think lot elderly people feel way her. Rounding edge bowl, flushes. *antigen

so testing actual infected people ppl covid past. time 3rd COVID wave! Let's check, maybe longer infectious cruise ships! phased system terms measures...the metrics determine phase clearly defined. entire state Phase 4, even though rapid community spread consistently rising death hospitalization numbers criteria moving Phase 1, would lockdown. governor longer mandate this, health department could already have. lot people, actually. literal centre Europe, got castles per person got beatiful nature. Eh I've met seen extremely selfish rights freedoms. could care less others. testing behind scenes make public confidence. quite irrelevant now.

But back too. totally agree. I'm also biased, married deputy former deputy. inside, think true. I've always thought adrenaline junky types go city jobs deputies laid back even keeled. get spend fair amount time things typical cop stuff. spent time helping people deal bear break-ins, natural disaster issues, bs-ing great people lived area (which means outside city limits within county) questions needed advice someone talk to. 

The elected vs appointed thing sheriff chief makes difference people. instance folks known constitutionalists behave different pulled deputy vs officer. Maybe them, maybe overall rule ones I've dealt with, true. Deaths lag behind cases...and right US multiple states surging *first* wave, cases rising northeast. northeast can’t keep cases control, they’ll second wave France experiencing. talking us mate. awesome. could tested vic 1 weekend would less painful.

Europe USA though.... comes Thanksgiving. Christmas. New Years. Well whole issue. Potentially yes especially social distancing masks. We'll wait weeks though see covid spikes Good question!
See inhaled interferon beta SNG001. Heading Phase 3 clinical trial US UK month. Phase 2 results saw 79% patients going require mechanical ventilation. peer review results imminent. ...no doesn't? least superintendent sounds sensible. saw news yesterday Tempe schools switching person Tuesday. likely going regret that. Stay safe stranger. aren’t member already, feel free join us /r/coronavirusaz They're premature results out, especially thing ""the risks associated vaccination"" results sounds anti-vax. sounds like might much case first vaccines good, testing process designed test reduction symptoms, reduction actual infection (sterilising immunity).

But predict every country vaccine massively reduces hospitalisations deaths, political push end massively reduce restrictions. UK nearly removed restrictions summer even without vaccine (the speed amount mistake hindsight although level still good idea). Son, position call anybody fraud limited knowledge immune system going feelings. nobody. eviction moratoriums millions unemployment run out, within next 4 6 months hell going break loose. Shocking..good thing we're ""rounding corner"".. unless meant right brick wall connected cemetery.. reduces symptoms reduce spread also, people lower viral loads (e.g. famous challenge trial cold coronavirus) ""test"" something imply either positive negative results english language. Weve gone 8 9 million cases 2 weeks. 9 9.5 million less week. Shit's going exponential Getting flu levels barely different making go away completely. Sadly way many idiots country achieve this. best bet vaccine fortunate enough Trump charge. democrats still locked regulations rather final stage trials. Hopefully Trump get re-elected Biden charge probably see another 6 months. blow Happens significant portion population stops giving shit put handmande sign door says **COVID-19 POSITIVE INSIDE, TOUCH DOOR RING DOORBELL, STAY SAFE, COVID KILLS KIDS** STILL knocking. think Tim They're heading summer.

Your second link shows death rate 2.2%. Would like let us know death rate Flu?

Go on, absolute genius.

I'm still laughing think virus nothing fat cousin practically asymptomatic. could start dystopian censoring social media stop spread news deadly virus maybe scared communist regime would massive fuckup even tried cover internally? could also say covering undercounting number deaths Wuhan 10x maybe using brain enough. country 1 billion people, virus spread without knowledge control least 3 months less total cases US today?

Or official death toll sitting 4634 people least 5 months. find extremely unbelievable single person 1.5 billion died coronavirus past 5 months.

And clear, I’m American. couldn’t care less US government handled pandemic. make TV show I’ll first watch. sure air sequel another communist fuckup. one add pretty extensive list. *Some parts America sound insane unless numbers still bad. want go back normal got insane exponential virus growth many areas. expect people stay home forever? wife recently diagnosed lupus, something worth exploring? exactly? US one 2 countries requires citizens live abroad pay taxes. Australia country. completely agree. depends individual. people clever enough realise something need do. 

The issue still belief deadly actually is. Bot damaging long term lot people suffered it... long covid..

To me.. look like 'United states' indeed United comes individuals. love country needed protect it. estimates around 10% peak infection rate earlier year

Yes, April Tegnell shocked discover FHM estimates many people exposed Stockholm greatly overinflated. FHM predicted 25%, truth less 8%.

The FHM history publishing faulty estimates turn wrong, greatly optimistic. Put simply, FHM estimates little “It means either calculations made agency quite wrong, possible, that’s case it’s surprising wrong,” told newspaper Dagens Nyheter.

Ohhhh study slums Mumbai something crazy like 40-50% infected. possible least poorer areas widely spread relevant businesses aren’t open. someone U.K., pretty big deal.

If saw town streets tonight you’d believe Blair’s spirit alive. We’re preparing hunker again. Tell goes, she’s coming back 2 weeks, without negative test hand. people sound like care others first place lol case death rates actually going though. seems worst may over, interesting see second wave esp north gets colder winter Looking short time frame day isn’t useful either. claim Europe double population still recorded less 10 million cases vs US ~9.4 million cases entire pandemic. yes it’s fair assessment say point United States performing worse Europe. That’s Americans like point smaller nation data. also noted many smaller nations much transparent figures probably accurate numbers US. US reporting deaths.  Stab me, stab please would take improvement point. 90% tested negative? 10% chance false negative **actual** chance infected likely 100 times less. moderation doo doo virus come US via Canada Mexico. Even US island, case numbers death toll would probably almost exactly same. reminded wish still around tell us Club Covid Ah yes, 'lockdown literally forever' strategy.

Especially getting tear gassed. Yeah, blows mind. OK go work thousands different households one building, OK wedding FAMILY. Yep, makes utter sense. US solved ton health problems past food fortification. Iron grain products, iodine salt, vitamin milk, etc. I'm particularly concerned dying myself. I'm concerned parents dying, regularly watch children we're work. public comply it?

I hope not, hopefully we've learned lesson past 8 months certainly lot promising data school transmission, I’d bit wary come from.

Your first link summer, reference schools partially open extensive social distancing measures limited numbers.

Your second link says “ Britain Netherlands kept schools open restrictions class sizes requirements mask-wearing. Yet they, too, shown limited transmission among younger children children parents.”

But link reference UK outdated source based crude age analysis infections, information outbreaks.

If look [latest version see *rapidly rising rates* among school children teenagers young adults continue highest positivity rates, rates appear steeply increasing among secondary school children. 

Other data shows institutional outbreaks occurring mainly ware times move quickly, months ago could write articles like data reveal different story. **Nov. 1, 00:00 (UTC+9)**

Even lockdown HARD right now, numbers continue climbing couple weeks, creates perfect storm defeatists scream pointless open let people die. Community spirit vital. cannot understate enough. Lockdown protect community, yourself, anyone pushing end thinking \*only\* themselves. People travel internationally number reasons one tourism. Business, family, co-habiting. South West basically everybody wears mask shops public transport staff good job reminding people.

I guess lot dickheads London.  Cement toilet holes walls. Check master's government basically given testing. numbers longer reliable.

Keep mind 60 daily cases summer government bother set contact tracing, release tracking app, increase testing capacity basically anything constantly relaxing measures even cases started rise again.

Now something like 30K daily cases even catch half government stopped testing demand. hospitals get full government bother expand ICU capacity either.

Oh, government one thing: raise taxes.

Yeah, sure. Absofuckinglutely. considering everything know place can't possibly know, think best option taken, still business, good employees paid better since employers determine keep thus reviews done, customers starting come back know problems kitchen dealt with.  


But took letting chaos take toll get without shutting entirely. Techincally, legally... brought cavalry speak. Public health many problems abound. still ""fixable"". Albeit lot arm twisting bosses, fixable.  


And fixed it. Fuck me, right? We're first child, nice know there's precedent us travel much like whenever flimsy child care reasons... Although wish argue lockdown, wish would put place start school holidays. postponed wedding already 3rd December crap, going cause massive issue hotels like.

The wedding may still able go ahead, hotel rooms I've booked night before... Well, fuck knows now.

I get important, people's lives matter more, constant twisting turning head in.  Wearing mask saying away others you’re sick DRASTICALLY different we’re right now. really see difference...? 

Government mandated closures businesses. Mask mandates leave house. told see anyone indoors isn’t residing house you....... isn’t Asian countries .... exactly described, social distancing, mask mandates (not feeling ill), business closures long term solution? *still* haven’t answered question. must career politician ...  Yes is. needs happen needs start somewhere. That's patently false evidenced talking China 200 countries better us. Frankly think would fool believe China US. Lockdown till reasonable amount cases test everyone isolate infected 

AND close borders DOMESTIC TRAVEL 'I hope dont ease quickly!' Spoken white collar slave. 


You'd talk differently affected Yeah absolutely, current one doesn’t even medical degree training kind. stop dramatic. every supermarket big sign saying need mask entry, least one security guard enforcing entrance. sure independent shops every shop i've staff masked up. walking street people maskless right there, people mask somewhere signs requesting so. Yes possible. started step father justed tested positive couple days ago.

Make sure stay quarantined receive test results. mom tested currently awaiting results. live took get tested amount cases city, worth getting tested due possibility asymptomatic. lockdown ends, feel like essential workers given power enforce mandatory masks hand sanitizer environments work in. amount people simply refuse wear mask/wear nose keep hands sanitized absolutely staggering. Yeah UN ineffective mostly


 gajillion resolutions stop Israeli settlemen example...that effect whatsoever UK still island. could handled like NZ corrupt incompetent baffoons charge. guys voted 2016, looks like guys going vote again. 

Congratulations, failed state. Well yeah... comment didn’t disagree anything said. many instances, keep 6ft sidewalk someone walks past Source: Germany.

the issues first partial lockdown back March were:

- children home meant least one adult stay home, too. Since many families parents work, caused issues. 
- domestic violence rose especially less well families (e.g. parents without job / welfare, small apartment, kids suddenly home day long)
- even normal families issues wiith kids home / online learning, e.g. family three kids suddenly need computer online learning, one computer whole family.
- add that, many schools still live dark ages regarding digitalization efforts. many cases, ""learning home"" consisted teachers dropping photocopied work sheets kid's home maybe phone call later ask problems. Yeah, mentally prepare long haul, panic shopping thing. That's negative feedback loop hurts everyone. well stocked pantry one grocery shop week mostly fresh produce restock things pantry used week.

It'll least three months hard lockdown lucky. There's around 2-3 week delay enacting measure curb numbers, seeing outcomes measures, numbers likely still climb first couple weeks anything changes really rough community moral. 

There extremely loud minority defeatists, demanding reopen numbers big handle give trying control spread turn herd immunity strategy. push early reopening nothing work mind, also push early reopening first sign downturn numbers ""this good going get."" let drown voices reason. 

Remember, everything delay; takes days get results test, takes couple weeks virus either kill someone stop infectious. Daily death counts people infected roughly fortnight prior, daily case numbers tests day two prior. 3-5% daily case numbers relatively good prediction mortality rate fortnight. Use incentive. Every day numbers decline, one twenty difference life saved fortnight. went 700+ daily cases August single digits couple zero days week. 

It possible. easy, possible. Sense community critical. us young healthy we're lockdown protect ourselves. protect vulnerable community. Good point shared Cuomo partners PA Tom Wolf CT Lamont NJ Murphy example indoor party. say watched press conference hospital leaders city. head children's hospital made comment seemed pretty line comments that's kids really impacted virus. last hospital leader comparing hospital capacity compared area hospitals.

Considering bulk comments ignoring facts flailing arms around going “BUT SCHOOLS NEED OPEN”, I’d say person you’re replying dead money school glorified day care.

You wanna risk children exposed another child? 
Possibly child anti-mask parent? 

Because can’t afford homeschool something?

That totally justifies opening schools, totally.

Jesus Christ. ""lockdown"" lockdown all, way. Schools remain open, businesses remain open, go anywhere anything long cops catch you, way enforce rules certain neighbourhoods even patrol anymore.

Also government expects hospitals full 2 weeks, new patients rejected. Thank much sharing this, hard find information Canada. basically outlined needs happen eliminate covid non-totalitarian country. Also exposed another major blunder Europe/North America: reopening schools midst rampant, untraceable, nationwide community spread. cases Canada surging reopened schools. Another one unbelievable series blunders leadership. 

Another question media leadership never mentioned elimination/eradication start, even back March realistic achievable possibility. start told never gone vaccine ""curve flattened"". dangerous ""flatten curve"" message presented Australia committed elimination form start? ""flattening curve"" initial goal tone change elimination presented? Unless you’re buying foo-foo raw pastured milk US, added vitamin D.

I mean Toilet Paper Pasta already becoming scarce recently we’re back square one people won’t fucking learn. Wait what? thing 10 years here. put pin tap purchase? say it, idiots! lining streets hugging Friday night, house parties, etc etc.

It's GUIDANCE, look word up, make informed decision spoonfed every fucking answer. Nothing wrong hermit. everyone needs constant external stimulation. would economic disaster. us actually want work. furloughed really hope get continue working time around. anxiety job furloughed horrific. get right article talk diabetic typ1 covid person diabetic typ1 get autoantibodies really understand think I'm upset. I'm stating opinion think stupid lock entire countries &lt; 2% CFR virus 8/10 people get mild symptoms. I've living life fine Denmark, barely 30 cases total city. really see reason upset. Quite opposite. flown USA UK? plane UK always seen signs life whether city, power plant, village even farm. Parts USA wilderness, even road site! UK dense population. 10 miles nearest town supermarket doctor's surgery considered remote. factual destroyed economy, GDP 7%, far. don’t know suicides. 

All sucked, alternatives worse. least worst outcome. 

Personally found very, easy. I’m working home indefinitely now; everyone convinced actually work better home. I’m lucky profession accomodate that. Cool US actually much higher GDP per capita Australia. structure economy roughly similar too. 

I think key difference US COVID relief money largely targeted bailouts big business, Australia largely given workers industries affected lockdown (mainly hospitality) businesses employing workers.  seasonal flu killed lot flu, existed every season... way seasonal flu lol must know bunch people covid already recovered, buddy quite well many people know Healthcare industry know deadly virus kills older folks people weak immune systems. obese neighbor works healthcare covid 3 times tell deadly virus is. believe bullshit media hype, reddit trying argue r/corornavirus probably gotta CNN house meet one person outside household, long stay distanced other. want go walk chat friend, that's ok. Vitamin enhances effect 5G rays sheeple brain. referring early massive elderly deaths. Also, lockdown dependent people. People Sweden quite good staying distance, blood. doesn't, tough situation: anything spring lockdowns would looked dumb. OTOH, learned repeat would sustainable.

So it: lockdown without lockdown. sawr since 2015 also agree this, like people stop going entertainment winter, going holiday, activitys mostly inside second wave hard, summer lockdown could still stuff socializing outside rate infection low, winter either nothing inside. Probably different mask ratio events, count anything THING?!? (American here, government determined us die asap /mostly s)  Disposable bpa free polyurethane gloves lifesaver. Put exit car go shopping. Throw away soon exit. They're like $20 500 pairs.

Plus makes aware hands accidentally touch face. 

One less worry insane world. NATO thing. confirmed came infected person restaurant!?  weird seem upset whole thing stopping able interpret simple line graph Ever stop think many 30k cases infect cause extra strain hospitals? rallies go exact heath orders congregating large crowds.  American derby Let's face it. Americans would get upset lockdowns even affording it. would holler ""muh rights"" leave home. many can't even deal wearing mask inside store right now. usa broken country. Maybe maybe virus mutated That's saddest part He’ll never live Engadine Macca’s incident. slides even fully fit screen information cropped even practiced it!? okay kill people based age? grandparents? planning die young? lucky, age group one day too. worry, I've able live life fine restrictions government virus barely kills 70 year olds mate. worked last one. First 5 weeks thought allowed found were. told us first might three weeks reviewed... pain would still less time spent going lockdown racking ever-increasing population post-covid sufferers whose health permanently impaired. Texan, I'm even remotely surprised... got lady defied lockdown orders keeping salon open (and getting saved governor cause outraged Republicans much got arrested it) running seat Texas State Senate actually really good shot winning.

People value ""freedom"" living, apparently. ok man, let feelings out, facts still done. Fauci called shit June. Every prediction spot worse fall going winter. Want know thing going keep panning out? Keep listening Fauci. makes angry, sad. deniers know convinced propaganda ploy get Trump office, morning Biden wins election COVID coverage evaporate.

They can't see obvious (e.g. exists countries outside US) facts logic figure it. expect days I'll finally able give verbal punch head willfully obtuse. im saying people going die virus matter what, articles like one seem make trump rallies hot spots virus killing people droves flat true. 30k cases trump rallies 9 million cases America? Thats hardly cause concern. Many super spreader events outdoor. one got Trump sick was. think anyone shit control fucking deluded mate. actually free. cost goods higher. 3% supposedly I've seen much higher items. might've worked literally everywhere moved tier two were. worst places tightest lockdown places ok extra restrictions help stop increases. late seem tight restrictions -_- Yes Victoria (6.4 million) NSW (8 million) lockdown basically 13th 18th state populations USA. aren’t dink little outpost, they’re every bit large modern many US states. It’s took political fortitude effort part people follow guidelines rather thinking slight freedoms. People generally cohesive board unlike Divided States America. Even quite simple issue masks, cost effective proven success cannot implemented majority US states, telling. yet could take active steps impede states. Like trying force WA open borders. outrageous, armed men come take anti-maskers away? kind behavior never tolerated Boraqua. act like that, put jail - right away. trial, nothing. Anti-vaxxers? special jail anti-vaxxers. social distance? Right jail. party? Right jail, right away. go shopping fever? Jail. cough? Jail. charging high prices masks, hand sanitizer? right jail. work home, believe not, jail. workout gym, also jail. Work-in workout. get called COVID testing show up? Believe not, jail, right away.

We least patients world, jail. Oh El Paso everyone stores wearing masks. shooting last year security every Walmart Sams Club can’t get without one all. 

A big part rise infections due military base, stop accepting civilians never closed down. military hospital ran space actual city hospitals. lax base allowed keep working even positive test. lot factors (Hispanic culture it’s emphasis get togethers etc.) biggest town within city tried stop virus I've mostly seen ""I'm exempt"" ""I medical condition"". Nobody questions them. perhaps masks social distancing keeping influenza numbers low, like Australia's recent winter. FWIW think guy right this, he’s pleasant. 

What he’s saying little idea true state pandemic places poor public health capabilities, it’s possible (even probable) countries like India, Indonesia Brazil far higher rates infection currently reporting. It’s likely dust settles, excess mortality data going way figure out. Even then, reporting deaths isn’t necessarily iron-clad.

Doesn’t stop US’s response trash, worthwhile bearing mind especially get “we open back world” phase. Yeah, many hospitality businesses making profit right now, scrambling desperately stay afloat.

I work hotel we're *far* better position variety reasons, survival guaranteed still even amount money hotel lost year genuinely eyewatering. hell anywhere less fortunate us gonna make beyond me. Without financial assistance, you’ll probably run Judgment Proof problem sooner later fines literally mean nothing. 😉 multiple cultures America. cultures within america better following rules others. election, less incentive cut nose order spite face. Keep telling helps man :D pandemic control need vent stress badly ok need take us, get big science scary sometimes. Never go Texan DEATH line!!!!! dead. laughable. Ignoring data emotion. one saying terrible simply saying par 9th place first. I'd home school ability too. That’s I’m talking about! Arrest put jail!!! I'm saying lives get upended. I'm saying lives got upended needlessly. current administration kept pandemic response team, listened Dr Messonnier, Dr Fauci, federally mandated wearing mask, would likely still jobs.

It announced lives changed responses power hide it, deny it, admit it, rinse repeat. suffer yet nothing changes. asymptomatic? what's blood type? don’t think we’ll know, hopefully we’ll never get chance try - it’s really put stress I've using stick poke numbers keys saw someone sneezed pin pad one cleaned England Boris filmed classroom appeared socially distancing. end camera pans round half class crammed corner together! stayed home first. Victoria masks got loose while. places eradicated local transmission months ago, we've opened we're wearing masks.

Basically?

We took seriously start. Crushed numbers greater good everyone. looked amount vitamin added milk US.  small amount -- typically 100 IU vitamin per 8 ounce serving milk. 

Is 100 IU per day enough? recommendations seen vitamin supplements protect viral infections, higher. Even RMD protect rickets, higher. what's point? virus eradicated time frame? Nah. still Australia continue spread lockdown lockdown. Per capita certain US states ahead European countries too. false equivalency compare smaller countries/states 300+ million population nation. denying fact kills older people higher rate younger post made seem like rallies ok asking ages deaths... 700 deaths attributed rally 700 deaths either way look it, young, old whatever case may be, responsible 700 deaths. funny, Texans obese ""freedom movement"" severely restricted. massive benefit then, less taking vitamin D. maybe different ionophore would work. Personally sambucol vitamin C zinc ready take first sign respiratory symptoms. May help like taste anyway. ID looking hospitals WA send patients. several states middle country nearing capacity. Good thing we've already past winter here.. forgot expand last sentence,

""Better them"" imo one greatest ones. sides listen it, even better read lyrics. 

I also like lyrics often describing, like ""Green Grey"" solo ""Ocean Rising"". weeks needed Australia, New Zealand proved. Even weeks amazing. no. could stop pieces shit endure lockdown properly need go forever. Bur pathetic ppl like understand lockdowns work abide claim work. 
A weeks kill anyone. need socialize badly use internet. survive it. Many places it. Many ppl it. Also ways socialize online apart Zoom Skype. chronically ill able go normally half life. tell ppl need socializing survive. I've done it. 
Yes know everyone lives line ppl suck it. weeks needed. Ffs. Exceedingly unlikely without financial support civilians/businesses, even blue sweep, unlikely occur next year. otherwise much likely backfire rather spectacular fashion. next germiest thing -- smartphone, probably 5 Yuan deposited account. China grow larger, comrade! Extends furlough day lot people got made redundant everyone thought furlough ending. Fuckin government! Belgium reported 173 deaths far today, would 5,000 deaths US.

Belgium's total death rate 1,002 per million, compared 712 US 767 Spain. France, Italy, UK 563, 639, 685. Others 120 400. new study 30,000 COVID-19 patients suggests antibodies people produce fight virus last longer previously finding help vaccine makers well researchers trying determine whether COVID-19 survivors become ""Some (studies) reported declines antibodies first weeks first months seen,"" said Ania Wajnberg, lead author new study medical director Mount Sinai's clinical antibody testing ""We see slight decline, overall stable level."" believe grouse shooting still allowed. assume unemployed covid well? see say nothing changed tens millions people whose lives got completely upended due covid. Life knew basically following 9/11 outside going airport, even compare much changed due covid. think lockdown needed, work stop too. stressful enough cooped without deal zoom meetings conference calls. government pay us stay home. people working truly essential workers: Hospitals, Police Firefighters get paid double even triple, risking lives. Well done guys, two donut days row! sunny year round!? comment *BioEdge* pushing Opus Dei narratives get chance? promise won’t removed, stay civil. work large multinational company supposed go China months ago. employer people monitoring hospitals since February. early May June seen photographs taken public hospitals Shanghai Shenzhen showed average occupancy. Things exact learn lessons. several things USA could implement learning experience others even situations differ.

Wear masks. Fine people without valid excuse. 

We reduced capacity high risk locations like meat processing.

Reduce/eliminate people working across multiple sites facilities like aged care.

Set limits number people given floorspace.

Close eat food services. Take away outdoor dining.

Enforce work home possible.

Simply downplaying virus months would good. promoting unproven medication miracle cures.

The list goes on. Ugh, we'll end Wolverines, guarantee it. death rate compare? US, March/April hasn’t gone 1200, usually 500 1000 separate discussion covid deaths - whcih agree you

But appeasement cause second world war, delayed inevitable. think that's common misconception - time, British French public wanted avoid another war - particularly French, lost almost quarter adult male population first world war. isn’t remotely unusual; viral infections amongst common triggers autoimmune conditions. sequelae significant, they’re pretty rare remotely unique COVID-19. Really? Look data see maybe 10,000 whole time equivalent past year, recruitment drive started pre covid try fill 40,000 vacancies. trained everyone else rushing round like crazy without time teach. started train doctors - losing thanks appalling pay working conditions. takes 10 years fully train doctor. 

How many new recruits stick around realise bad conditions are? Called mom lives Texas week Thanksgiving plans. going travel back state said there’d small family gathering, maybe immediate family grandparents something like that.

Instead, tells thirty-one people (who RSVP’d _so far_) attendance. THIRTY ONE. 

So I’m spending holiday alone. want rules simple variations possible. ""If outside house, must wear mask"" leaves little room ""interpretation"".

And masks protect *other* people, you. stop spreading much stop getting it. De nada. Didn’t hear, virus LITERALLY Black Death lungs explode 5 seconds recovering /s need military draft - people serve basic level nursing. 3 month boot camp learn shit get asses hospitals. Start anyone professing anti-mask covid conspiracy sentiment Facebook. Oh gods sake. puerile post even puerile answers. Better 100 cases undetected shitstorm going US atm. depends congested city is, can't keep outside 2 metres people recommended. 

Contrary popular belief virus apparently 'fly' go airborne carried away fresh air wind. travels droplets affected gravity really matter located, someone coughs, sneezes, talks within close radius there's chance sprayed know really related, playing around noticed South Dakota fucking 47% positive test rate. think comment saying pandemic real. pointing benefit quickly ending reducing damage pandemic. Especially since fact wealthy profiting pandemic. Honestly think kept people sane schools open. controversial lots people, e.g. majority r/ireland disagrees, open schools means seeing people streets, normality daily routines, parents still work, kids/teenagers still see friends even though playdates/parties allowed.

Also parks open meet friends takeaway coffee. harder spring cold dark, bearable.

This week 400-800 cases day 1200-1500 day lockdown started. Possibly partial lockdown introduced Dublin already effect. Right wing media done irreparable damage US. watched Tucker Carlson Hannity yesterday couldn’t believe watching. people fall shit?  Texas Sucks I’d agree except essential worker it’s super annoying uncomfortable wear especially hot extended period time. pandemic already work uncomfortable positions shouldn’t keep suffering others. Social interaction prohibition, usual doesn’t work paint long known deeply thought about. U Minn, held national seminars (I attended one)at time H5N1. topics discussed. Reps major companies US seminar. pandemic plans long settled. Trump destroyed infrastructure, plan book, companies agreed. WalMart's trucks would involved moving things needed. Now, there's Amazon trailers nearly every common carrier providing power.

The issue, saw raise last mile. virus respiratory issue. guess attention paid that. Trump imo federal rule violator downplay need safe responsible. get action bring close. president carte blanche expose anyone risk like happening now. Daniel Defoe reported historical novel called Journal Plague Year 1722 scenarios raise. Reading book like standing balcony overlooking city watching long dead act behaviors see now. think works like that. early on, may breathing virus yet there'd nothing detect. swab test however, find early. Dutch company working breathalyzer test could give accurate results almost instantly. They've tested testing streets Netherlands results promising.

The goal test see positive, see negative. breathalyzer sure COVID-19, go back home, there's dought, machine says possibly COVID continue get RT-PCR test give definitive result. helps, basically get like 90% negatives line test remaining 10% questionable negatives positives test. practically massively increases testing capacity. testing Netherlands showed test sensitive basically let positive cases think negative. deployed next month Netherlands. agree, see people US Facebook making statements. similar sentiments Australia people disregard others many, wish masks come sooner political. state live mask mandate also take mine mandate over, future start feel sick wear one. never thought flu potentially spreading kill someone risk, back mind I'll mask others. small discomfort something positive. done? Shut entirely? When? always grateful continue even moreso born raised land under. 

What rest world facing horrifying. current death toll 17,000, doubt could jump much less 2 months. Fatality rate low median age. US Europe, old people make much higher proportion population India. I've check couple times, I'm otherwise extremely serious isolating (high-risk member immediate family). Going many months remote socializing tough, I'm real introvert. Ok Nostradamus. 1 year write let’s talk about. learn manners. milk good really fast put pin pay wave limit $100 $200 Australia March.

Asia Japan, socially acceptable wear masks public especially allergy season, people diseases also many Asian women want use masks cover mouths.

In America Europe, people usually think wear masks “Are paranoid closed off, cover face/mouth?” “What wrong you?” “Are sick?” “If sick, don’t stay home?” first came across conspiracy kid, confused one-world government sounded like stuff utopic post-scarcity societies sci-fi wondered attempt would bad thing virus everywhere, get anywhere.

It’s fact many kids.. kids don’t know keep safe teens think invincible small poorly ventilated space going home spread siblings grandparents parents coworkers. Generally speaking person contagious 48 72 hours symptom onset think 20% chance won’t symptoms all. One child would come contact potential hundreds people time start contagious time realize they’re even sick. That’s schools shouldn’t open. boyfriend supposed work two separate grocery stores safely? Like I’m screwed right? get bit specific:

Victoria went lockdown, metro areas full lockdown. leave house unless good reason, even 5km max (this since relaxed). Masks still mandatory pretty much anytime leave home except eating engaging strenuous exercise (which allowed 1 hour per day, strictly outside). long time 8pm curfew that's since relaxed. visit anyone except example family members needed care (sick, elderly etc.).

I've posted similar thread though - think response would possible US. There's lot differences terms Australia's population/geography, support systems, wealth disparity (which think would huge issue guys stores shut way did).

Maybe super, super proactive first wave hit, can't see response working now. “Oh shut up”

No one knows end.  Including ugly mouth. article says nothing infecting bunch people.. fact flight attendant performed CPR tested negative after. That's better useless temperature checks. Every workplace, airport school one. Saw woman brazenly walk shop earlier without mask. Nobody batted eyelid.

""oh I'm embarrassed, keep forgetting mask work""

Also fact people got paid basic small wage help tough times made way easier get people comply think can, can’t expect every shop security guard police officer enforce it.

Here things introduced assist Covid-19. 

**JobKeeper** 

In March 2020 Australian government announced $130 billion JobKeeper payment package support affected businesses employees COVID-19 pandemic.  

Eligible employers would receive $1,500 payment per fortnight, per eligible employee 27 September 2020 assist economic impact caused COVID-19. package extended last March 2021. 

**JobSeeker** 

The Jobseeker payment payment available employees stood let go, sole traders, self-employed, casual workers contract workers meet income test result economic downturn due Coronavirus. asset test one week waiting period waived.
With scheme, Jobseeker get anything $565.70 $790.10  

If eligible Jobseeker payment (or receive certain Human Services payments Youth Allowance Jobseeker, Parenting Payment others) eligible Coronavirus Supplement Payment. 

This new additional support payment $550 per fortnight starting 27 April 2020. 

*Superannuation Drawdown** 

Eligible citizens permanent residents Australia New Zealand apply 2020–21 financial year access $10,000 super. 

I've working moderate salary ~ 12 years $120,000 Superannuation account. needed to, could drawn $10,000 June end financial year August. 

I'll update comment information shortly. Looking mortality rate hard justify lockdowns means mass unemployment economic recession. could lead severe unrepairable damage global civilization could lead end modern era things take bad turn, world politics already fragile state. estimate mortality rate 0.6% ages, 0.1% age 70 4.3% age 70. People die every day, stop living it, actually lucky old people die. simple solution, follow Sweden, balance key longevity, minor dynamic restrictions combat spread, sacrifice save many ultimately future mankind. I’m going take wild stab assume there’s sampling bias online poll. 4Chan get hold Facebook group greatly skew results? Uh huh. 

Go back justifying Ruby Princess, hack. great idea! could even write marker use throw away ones cold Chief scientist Federal Government said 'nit incorrect' say Victoria nation's best contact tracing. reason mask-wearing failed we're selfish care protecting people around us getting whatever we're sick with. 

Would gotten better results started masks protect wearer. Human nature illegal think problem though city size El Paso need man power city PD help enforcement. doesn’t enough man power deal daily emergencies additional workload shutting everything. 

Also think considering county judge legal power organizing emergency response city county... PD enforcing it. obviously understand wrote.

Let's make easier you.

More tests means USA catching larger percentage overall case numbers good. testing better. way suggests trump done good job know greater deal accuracy bad is.

I never knew dense people could covid hit. TIL.... Polish I've taking who's comments I've translating think hoax exaggerated. seems everyone taking seriously, disprove right wing government think exaggerated suppress protests, right wing supporters government think Bill Gates owns company making RT-PCR machines inaccurate, Doctors get paid diagnose Covid, 80% tests false negative. perfect setup become worst outbreak Europe. don’t opinion one way current state tracing - however - CHO friends mouth piece government aren’t going take shit public. want us go buy lots xmas presents spent money  lead contenders implied work. need demonstrate implication practice, currently done phase 3 trials. **contrary**, USA almost 100,000 cases yesterday per John Hopkins science say definitively time.

Bigger always better. insane surreal hear many people supposed government fallowed suit helped people instead saying doctors lying really isn’t big deal need learn live it.
Good job Aussies envy you!! I’m praying it’s minority. think could sneak Australia things go south days?? Lol please commit democracy actually know that. would great reinfection rare, might be. right now, order something classifued reinfection, person would needed tested twice, get accurate positive twice, samples sequenced, infection verified different enough genome sequence, definitively stare reinfection resurgence. top many individuals asymptomatic first time, excluded studies.

So multiple problems preventing us knowing true rate reinfection.

1) lack testing initially

2) lack testing asymptomatic people

3) failure maintain sample records

4) lack genome sequencing

5) reinfection similar viruses

6) lack time. Right parameters we're seeing reinfections people initial test shortages (that went summer), got sick after. people gotten sick twice July now. words fraction people got sick twice 4 months. also 1/4th time virus spreading. 

We also thought kids spread virus effectively lacked data. also thought asymptomatic spread concern lacked data. New evidence changed assertions. Victoria Australia done bloody hard beating virus back. hope prepared long road ahead it'll work. google hunny Hang mate Theories. also like elementary.

Look this, really devoid humanity want continue people ? that's fucked up. Australia already eliminated first strain virus came country roughly June/July. unfortunate timing hotel quarantine outbreak (that started completely separate second wave caused different strain) happened shortly afterwards.

We've probably (as long NSW community transmission stops soon) eliminated twice country. Oh goodie, another “airborne AIDS” article breakdown over. Suicides actually slightly lower last year according last report saw. Admittedly earlier lockdown. question adapt neighbors restrictions.

You can't really answer restriction none neighbors have. university actually publishes covid figures, despite large increase start, covid figures student staff population actually par normal population. think they're keeping universities open students rush home actually spread covid more. That’s good. Cool excuses mate, that's are. Listen countries scientists learn follow adults room.

I’m thinking issue many families Christmas regardless covid regulations, Boris knows it, try mitigate damage much possible. seatmates would noticed something spoken after.  ashamed English. country total shambles Bale shambles Look, don’t want facts true either bigger consequence here? Someone loses life... temporarily unemployed?

Please understand second trying play impacts beyond death virus. see hard hitting people, know friends lost livelyhoods, homes benefits first time lives struggling make ends meet. also know several who’ve lost beloved family members 2 friends died. 

I’m sorry losing jobs equal losing life. It’s shitty thing acknowledge... get that. essentially prioritise job security etc lives means willingly sacrificing it.

That’s point. We’re used living pretty convenient lives consider tragic choice made boils to. Fair enough, TIL mean, Spanish flu never went away, neither H1N1. Almost every debit purchase requires pin sometimes credit certain amount usually Passengers told **3 months** later!?

What going there? Nope, hard. hard. locked winter first part spring, two full terms remote schooling, visits allowed household, backyard, allowed outside hour day. fact raining cold outside meant kids less desire get there, part easier. one finest parenting moments, video game console saved everyone's sanity lockdown. Imagine thinking need Australian listen doctor scientists. 

What weak excuse use hide fact countrymen would rather kill sacrifice. It’s mass spectrometer. Analyses volatile organic compounds based charge/mass ratio.

Accuracy ok 90%, false positives. since results really quick use pre-screening tool determine needs qPCR test. noticed throughout though seem loud vocal minority sound similar US freedumbs people. many people know starting sound unreasonably selfish crazy. Washington D.C., state. Ha EU started acting like dumb fucks virus people stopped caring masks way Americans many countries. guess one since didn’t manage reply. numbers suggest real risk high risk family members clearly taken account. positivity rate 20% probably enough testing skills move regional area- state often means tropical beach town. hi Piers yeah shows. 

I'm criticizing country's response. i'm criticizing saying people luxury australian killing people left right think locking viable strategy widespread community transmission. Apple Pay never requires tap pin debit card does. Normally limit 25 euro (or multiple smaller transactions single day go 50 euro). raised limit though, 50 100 euro respectively. Taiwan small island next China, far deeply interconnected state Europe like UK South Korea removed virus population. dozens cases every day 200 tests per million UK stay example nearly 5000. control effective contact tracing impossible implement liberal, western democracy. western people accept GPS surveillance state. Half Europe already fair share experience surveillance states. logical times smart phones facebook? obviously reality. political scientist philosopher time write book shortcomings democracy Activities schools kind high risk spreading. Kids mostly facing direction, other. talking much. breathing others faces. since kids get mild cases, spreading lower virus consentration. Nsw +1 case reported tomorrow’s official figures came 8pm. enforced 3 police officers left, public comply, many follow Cummings Barnard Castle. work maccies. Thought I'd get 4 weeks focus uni get paid furlough apparently we're still open drive delivery. Absolutely gutted. Conservatives: we've tried nothing we're ideas Listening little thing called medical science data modeling happen get numbers down. Melbourne everyone wearing masks, fines non compliance, jail repeat offenders.

We strict lockdown since June starting open new reported cases currently. Still restrictions particularly around home visits main transmission point.

More importantly leaders actually listen health experts rather spreading misinformation virus. ironic thing Australians liberties it. remember average person bit dick quite bit time. almost like masks nothing enclosed space. Especially mask discipline practiced everyone. Sweden would 2, recommendations. 

That true though. several laws place well. virus spreads person person. minimize contacts persons. 

Sounds easy. Must conspiracy. (&lt;- sarcasm) Well, go day intent protecting bs ""pandemic fatigue,"" point contact,/ interaction culprit. might look good country gonna get slammed new world order submitting Rona reset. childish imagine anyone ""ok"" misery, clearly one WANTS at. 

That's hard reality grown-ass adult, deal things sometimes, even really like makes sad.  premake masks since everyone gets sick occassionally. really upsetting much waste created pandemic. think mistake compare US Europe, South America matter.
All really demonstrates virtually countries regions made mess it, so. He's 👏 👏 downvoted👏 👏he's👏 being👏 an👏 annoying👏 asshole. absurd DG also useful summer, Melbourne gets pretty damn toasty. Sentience fancy term neural thinkers use pretend they’re special. physical/biological world many forms computation involve neurons produce hard, rational decisions based past performance certain situations. mean exponential logarithmic inverses other. Exponential growth correct. logarithmic plot commonly used see exponential growth straight line. That’s probably confusion. basically told foreigners (that can't support themselves) go home. lockdown lengthy Victoria virus likely go away given better warmer weather since growth (or lack thereof) case numbers also seem mimic flu) Masks thing Japan *very* long time: [**The history behind Japan’s love face horrible. Im sorry, know feels, feel pain. Aussies, love 'happy' Minister's whatever guise. Thankfully speak Australians saying Minister's genitalia/sexuality little interest beyond 'legal'. 

So glad hear 'passing through' great Country, wish 'bon-voyage' somewhere accepting narrow mindedness.  Wish America thing.. lot people fighting lockdown believing virus real still think going life best choice. Except leadership went opposite direction country countries already recovered. Jesus... that’s brutal. Meanwhile country ranked prepared deal global pandemic..... Early on. reopened proper controls.

Why hard understand? ""masks work"" ""let immune system"" people may wrong crazy Covid, normally something said it. otherwise healthy person, around people exposed everyday things carry good immune health. 

Covid wrong time it, hope apply highly contagious diseases like flu. one times? Trying sterilize every encounter life make situation worse long run. captured thoughts here, thanks validation. Thought me. also first ticket soon get chance. old overweight? Yes, know mine low elderly woman osteoporosis. malabsorption issue due chronic illness take 5,000 iuis day maintenance. That's pretty cool. information get infections are, informed decisions steps take next. Knowledge power. could quite conceivably go years. 

In country, England, best seem capable achieving series lock downs designed ensure NHS swamped, ultimately may save lives non-Covid related illnesses serve change date 3 months Covid patients losing lives.

What country people eh. best change date people dying unnecessarily.

I absolutely faith people changing behaviour, we'll back months time: stuck disaster lock again.

The United States seem faring better. There's definitely going ""whole lot hurt"" reasonable conclusions would suggest coming months. yes, however say test produce also false negative results, hand second round could also minimise factor. 

there pilot testing one week ago, tested 3 4 districts, want evaluate data one round regions needed not.  don’t think there’s ever generation mostly learned read home unless we’re going back 19th early 20th century many children home schooled

When illiterature way higher. 
Most children learn read pretty easily right age, anyone even slight learning disability (dyslexia, AD(H)D etc.) gets screwed without proper support.
Also problem home school badly educated parents can't really educate kids properly. could parent understand percentage calculation works, teach kids? Post/comment history says Denmark like first day community transmissions reported schools still open protesting, biology? even 15 minutes day front window, thats takes faired skinned. “Last weekend, live coverage Covid protest Naples, Sky Italia TV reporter middle demonstration attacked marchers attempted describe scenes around him. unfortunate correspondent abandon report then, make hasty, undignified, escape side road, chased marchers.”

These seem like work football goons looking bully anyone, egalitarian protest ensure worker’s rights. even read article? Well, part anti-mask sheeple, then, ""yes."" /s gave shit laying around considered clue doctors equivalent praying. think people going great lengths socialize sex devolution bad news babe. Europe put measures curb contagion, worked. lifted restrictions anti-masker, ""covid lie"" idiots appeared. back square one. Nothing weather. pointed scientists experts countless times, man. Please stop spreading uneducated opinion. need stay home 10 days, whole family. body makes plenty self-defeating adjustments ... notorious anaphylactic reaction, immune reaction essentially chokes death, struggle even breathe. Home isolation whole family 10 days knew nothing. Suspecting knowing. Enjoy ageicide. cant sit front window day ard fairer skinned 15 mins day darker 30-40 mins day? matter point? Idiots continue call relaxed efforts. Best hope virus kills idiots. price I’d pay actually concerned virus. neighbors deserve die. hope pray deny refuse masks get sick die off. literally offer anything society. world together room idiots deny real. test easily done multiple times, still useful. nice thing Bayesian maths constantly feed posterior distribution priori new test. far it’s pretty similar Stockholm districts hit hard spring fares better now. effect even greater consider testing capacity whole different level spring.

The spread clusters means way relaxing thinking it’s course one could assume immunity play role dampen spread. arrested..... virus eradicated, correct zero new cases tests last couple days. said didnt get it, post states exact opposite. 6m alot. True, seems still kind causality cases going deaths going up. Need political execute it. Well currently office do. shoo us brainwashed. Don’t let shit control fucking life dude, please sake get outside. Exposing sun? minutes day hands face enough. (Europe less black people, suffer lower sun exposure most) starting love wearing mask probably keep wearing long pandemic over. Interesting ... so, likely ""the missing links"" as-to patients may benefit Lupus RA drugs, much-touted hydroxychloroquine? member Tory cabinet. somebody said April

""If say Hmm, fancy fab go get fab. lockdown"" problem many residents obtuse anti science neo-facsist worshippers.

Hold fellow citizens accountable - hardly innocent victims. Sounds like British sitcom, US made US version witch ok good original. take mouth, struggle absorb regardless ingest it. healthcare systems better equipped prepared months earlier. mortality high earlier then.

I would say scenario mortality rise drastically critically infected hospitals deal with. What's done tested positive? People UK high risk age group background medical conditions gave high risk dying covid19. Received letters NHS, saying stay home. Various organisations arranged deliver food &amp; essentials door. went strictly exercise, well away anyone might infect them. Seemed work except people care homes. backed realised stood good chance costing Western Australia next election. 

Whether backed know. However say would reason. believe media. 

The Government actions matter would purely reaction Federal Bureaucracy. read reply? said people don’t need use conscious excuse.

My point changes attitudes people towards compliant authority, subconsciously part.

That’s people whinging moaning one man, they’re likely mix adults one household likely visit friends 2 hours drive away less likely want another lockdown. don’t know impression people sat inside whining Cummings. contrary, they’re behaving like nothing going furious restrictions whole Cummings palaver.

I don’t think people expect perfection top. bend backs trying defend government part. whole scandal didn’t sit right lot make people less supportive lockdowns.

Do want explain finally got past explaining it’s shift consciousness I’m talking people blaming every wrong move happens Cummings? I'm thinking visiting local supermarket scream people wearing mask distancing. staff enforce someone to. advice? Even sunscreen absorb vitamin d. Even sitting front window sun good you. also given experimental antibody drugs one else access to. Fuck off. still would look bad came said “I endorse Biden” something. think right. criticism clear read reply? said people don’t need use conscious excuse.

Glad many awake see figbt back.  guess certain sugar percentage maybe become lemon juice lemonade? people cant afford 5 dollar bottle. Especially public assistance limited budget I've read somewhere around 60-70% positives get caught, 0-0.3% negatives shown false positives. Hopefully someone better confirmed info. talking 30% approximately comparison pcr, say pcr test would reveal 3x infectious people. yeah, 2 rounds, mobility minimized, good chances win war. hand, people frustrated pushed go tests, otherwise could go work. also industries like gastronomy brutally struggling this. unlucky situation people. Every country those... trust American know. plenty. Shit man I'm sorry. confused thread honest mistake apologies Covid-19 caused outside force, coronavirus. Vote first. virus eliminated. need political it. Source? wrong Nobody covid three times lol. made up.

It would case entire world. makes global headlines people twice. even get twice. great. done people tested positive stay home two weeks probably slow spread lot. matter people's results wrong, long part population tested negative keep social distancing. dare people work expect want money work! Hiding half face probably makes feel less vulnerable. deal idiots don’t follow rules?  Kids spend 8 hours day together without mask, rules see eachother minute outside school. Clever right? Protocol COVID planes according ""our"" (Germany) CDC folks seats next row front back notified, since count close contacts. thirty one people enjoyable general? thats wayyyy much dinner Personally, yes, think chose risk. wouldn’t have, parents couldn’t stand idea robbing kid summer fun. Others wanted offload martini. Wisconsin, likely sneered Chicago’s lockdown, threw middle-finger wave decried need state-mandated precautions - time. Know first-hand. sayin’ ... unlike cruise ship, there’s way decision could made quarantine kids, even teens, camp due Covid infection - even sure it’s legal. Even martini parents would pick quarantine home. may stupid sent they’d labeled monsters keep there. national headline would sure change Leper Camp, rightfully so. UN founded October 2, 1945. Italy Germany surrendered ón April 29th May 8th, 1945. China before. sure method. Chinese use batch testing. didn’t dip flu season ended; dipped locked (in northeast) started wearing masks. Covid isn’t seasonal flu. agree worse winter can’t directly say “oh flu 20x worse January late October ergo covid” ago, nothing much changed: ""**There clear cases COVID-19 fomite transmission found literature. ""** possible/probable cases since, example New Zealand elevator button/trash Chinese CT machine, seems exceeding rare. also hospital researches swabbed surface around positive patients, found viral material, failed grow viable virus lab. See ""Low risk SARS-CoV-2 transmission fomites real-life conditions"" /r/COVID19/comments/j2dvxk/low_risk_of_sarscov2_transmission_by_fomites_in/

On hand vast majority cases shown result people talking together enclosed spaces. much airborne much droplets harder question clear current data. Imagine living aruba right now. work hotel closed, still get paid good dutch government, get spend days relaxing beach. Literally ancestors. Still noticing people know. people breathing neck standing line. Don’t fake smile anyone. love like saying would OK US army randomly killed soldierd WWII anyway many soldiers died.

Off course OK kill extra people lol 1% lol go school England asthmatic mother know many asthmatic people similarly go school. bare minimum social distancing mask measures (masks mandated corridors two weeks term finally decided good idea wear masks cramming 400 kids single staircase) it. Breaks classes normal masks social distancing (I jokingly coughed several times also crowd students repeatedly spat onto higher floors) long don’t mix year groups. youngest year six formers already sent two weeks seems it’s matter time rest too. ever hear back MLB Dodgers many people infected Justin Turner World Series celebration? Genuinely curious high low risk is. PM adviser called Dominic Cummings. He's absolute turd creature. heavily involved dicey data practices Brexit campaign upsettingly present vocal sorts big government decisions despite never elected anyone anything. face triggers deep urge human sees slap hard possible.

During first lockdown UK lot buy-in collective sense responsibility country here. vast majority people stayed put made sacrifices.

But Cummings. Cummings decided go family jaunt Barnard Castle. Bad enough got caught, made series bullshit lies. instead apologising fired government rallied round muddied message rules insist he'd done nothing wrong.

Morale England kinda tanked that. hope so. Looking many gross practices used have, it’s wonder everyone always sick. Texas United States fucking joke. nothing point pull America laughing stock. world history remember America let people die suffer literally nothing. Us technically started flu season 1/10 cases last year's similar week schools still open. lockdown. don’t think directly blaming trump. 
My interpretation rather elected someone like trump, course stupid disorganized enough could allow something like happen. Fear panic buying causes panic buying.

Just relax, there's enough everyone long want buy 18 months rations RIGHT INSTANT completely overwhelm supply chain.

Nothing's gonna close down, trucks stop driving, food stop sold, calm down. live, saw trick treaters streets parents none wearing masks. local high school closed two weeks three students teacher came covid. also others pending tests.  Honestly, *very* sceptical project, expected turn logistical nightmare terrible organization, frustrated people.

I still reservations whole project, organization surprisingly great given little time preparation. Hats army local governance. extremely difficult project, tight personnel resources (especially health professionals swabs) lack time prepare thoroughly.

I also pleasantly surprised calm responsible people waiting hours line. observed huge amount polarization, frustration, division Slovakia year, given general sentiment around COVID measures, surprised event brought people together. honestly feel given people something take part community really positive effect. Granted, many disagree this, many hate get tested allowed go work, stand long lines that. even among people disagree this, still respectful grateful people worked this, especially military, health professionals wore terribly uncomfortable overalls whole day tested millions people one day, thousands volunteers,...

I still think greatest use Ag tests (and might really bad consequences this), restored faith people country. Trump fires access media like given current position. He's trying prepare country what's potential coming way. trump wins, he's fired. Biden wins, chances announce fresh team task force. Either outcome, way he's using last bit time spotlight help people understand gravity situation. Seeing trump even mocked fox News host wrote mask rally, I'd say would wear one there.  Right?? Like, hell ever thinking? Though kind glad immune system buildup times get sick. man terrifying. certainly learned power social media hard way. sad got this. amount masks stop spend much time place opening windows get fresh air COVID doesn’t care whether poor, rich, middle class, wasn’t recently treatments became available successful. Poor black people access emergency rooms middle class white people. saying poverty doesn’t hurt exacerbate it, don’t think it’s simple. supermarket staff allowed to. us still do, though. Get annoyed every person claiming asthma/COPD come without mask buy cigarettes. wasn’t failure federal government. failure Republican government. Try drugs, makes feel better could get debt. mean it’s either ending existence...  Don’t expect get one right away becomes available.  Nursing homes healthcare workers front line. probably colleges. *everything*: coughing, fever, GI upset, respiratory failure, post-recovery inflammatory syndromes... contact tracing infected people, prime minister told everyone call friends relatives contact last days.

but also second streamline PCR test, countries daily basis. everyone get (for free money) also PCR test, hit tests per day (PCR) approximately 25k tests/day. PCR tests somehow limited. violent protestor protestor anymore. rioter terrorist. go pooled testing infection rate shrink pool. lower infection rate though bigger pools means lower amount supplies needed. Interesting. 9 million less tests, population lower, testing less, right? trying ass, confused here. Weather helps virus live longer surface. What's annoying November they've said still needs said. 60 Minutes interview, clear Dr Fauci like appearing (without consent quoted context) Trump ad. 

He looked furious fact. quiet way. 100k/319m = 0.0003

Sorry confusion Thanks again!
Yeah, I'll see find local information clusters like that. live Japan, information rich sadly... fake smiles! Fake smiles like forced hugs me...creepy. gotten lots reactions fake smiling...the mask def makes feel comfortable dont think local people realize much cases area increased.  German authorities: ""STOP TESTING! many tests! rate, we're testing every citizen YEAR! That's much! Preserve tests *who need most* \[whatever means lol\]!""

Slovakia: hahaha rapid antigen tests go brrrrr

Will interesting see effects have. guess would effective combined one-week, somewhat strict lockdown. First round tests Saturday, week lockdown, another round tests 7 days later. test positive need stay quarantine household 10 days so. soon people get kicked pubs/restaurants 10pm curfew, do? cluster outside place, drunk, maskless large groups. That's mask would help. Social distancing much difficult enforce mask-wearing; fact social distancing virtually non-existent experience. I’ve said thing. Masks don’t mean distancing unnecessary. Distancing already shot dark stop-gap, totally inadequate many indoor tightly packed spaces.

Masks help. don’t help enough, especially aren’t used 100% time (which aren’t eat drink) everyone space, used correctly.

Many get mask little pulling t-shirt nose goes like everything fine—and large swaths population.

It never safe reopen. Essential workers curbside drop offs/deliveries full PPE; establishment open. 

A society shutdown necessary sustain life 60 days—meeting household minimal needs meantime freezing rents/mortgages defective, ill-prepared, deadly.

The poorest subset left service entitled, least precautious, highest risk subset government doesn’t care them, many would rather die make minimal changes abide someone surviving short period time without punching time card—while privileged group gets pat back “keeping economy alive” going TGIChiliBees. Boo hoo fucking time instead letting virus run rampant. Congratulations catching everyone else.. say degree freedom severely restricted Hedge, retirement, investment funds, etc... need sell stakes FB good humanity. 

That way stop madness. gyms shit closed? Entertainment masquerading news. Half school associated cases district far teachers/staff. None cases led transmission within school communities, suggests mitigations working. 

A nearby high school go remote 2 weeks one infected teacher infected 5 teachers party attended. Students nothing transmission, suffered it. 

Teachers need stop screaming students little plague rats they're likely covid students are. Spirit Evil Employees customers ? local Wally, employees masked, 100%. customers, OTOH, whatever feel like. actually wear glasses, furthering contact tracer's befuddlement. honestly went back 3 weeks started feeling symptoms anywhere. high risk lives outside city kinda hung home since April. go plane right now, assume exposed. chiefs normally elected appointed either mayor city council

Which police chief incentive side mayor case. * aussies different social responsibility western europe. question really 'what US advanced societies doing'. 

* said that, europe recently gone rails - popular theory going around amount sunlight (au coming summer) people get - i.e. vitamin underrated resistance 'drug'. gets little press b/c big pharma makes money patents supplements. let alone au gets buckets sun year round, people get enough vitamin sun anyway. instagram stories filled people clubbing/house parties halloween parties around US shit getting depressed. research effect testing? irony strong one Bigger amount chad covid body, less virgin human cells, eventually become one covid near zero risk situations, like go run past group people. not, however, people cluster large groups outside shops/pubs/bars without mask, believe occurs far often. mask increase safety kind situation fairly significantly. Fresh air cure without adequate distancing. lockdown popular start became increasingly unpopular end, probably one reasons started ease restrictions hit case targets. Luckily case numbers came good end. 10days, thought virus last 14days? implementing country wide lockdown first discovery this? Actually members staff follow rules, decisive clear possible actual plan try eradicate disease.
Actually clear decisive plan going handle pandemic,instead handling half assed unprofessional way people clearly dire straights  Nah, person. people I'd say her. Trade L I’d happy man! Potentially. get groceries needs delivered. said mostly cooked home get food delivery twice. contact.

Stay safe! 🤗  irony everyone complains shutdowns bad economy, turns virus running rampant isn’t exactly great business either. state basically wide open, businesses suffering. thought India pace dethrone US number infections, US decides want stay #1. Still, 6 million lot. 25 million population, roughly 50% working age, rest either elderly children. take account remained working. would half working age population got job keeper.

I'm sort struggling find compelling theory explain Australia China pretty much zero cases - given they're less mutually hostile polar opposites countries.  people test, can’t really sure it’s accurate? he's telling great perfect probably give superpowers he's Twitter March telling it'll definitely kill them. Excuses what? I’m remotely sure point you’re trying make, I’m quite sure isn’t anything said. * logistics. Imagine much material redistribute.

Far less batshit crazy Orange County, CA. change state animal Coronavirus? see people saying refuse vaccine see people saying take mainly people like themselves, using presence bodies others pleasure. record high day 700+ confirmed cases. I'd hate think long would take somewhere like America same. Trump's followers want take now. Capitalism says, \`hold beer'. That’ll show pesky virus who’s boss. negate anything said? bruh go get tested realise amount unemployment we're gonna see hospitality sector dissolves

Yes significantly increased temporary Hospitality accounts around 10-15% jobs people going work? feed families?

Sorry wait argument legitimately spread pandemic already killed 1.2 million people keep jobs? fucking river I'm living streets come January.

Social safety nets exist reason yes absolutely ging tough time people work tourism year unemployment compare millions deaths, long term health consequence overwhelming healthcare workers services.

You literally killing people, makes shitty person. Wrong. post full misinformation?

It took 1 minute find Boris Johnson usin phrase ""lockdown"" twice one certain ministers used I've already proven point. recent study Roche/SD Biosensor test. No, kiddo, don't. Assuming Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine even proven effective, neither still undergoing safety trials Europe US, we'd need able distribute BILLIONS vaccine. is, again, assuming one-shot deal, coronaviruses seem follow. 

Do us solid actually research vaccines write garbage. lol fuck right. Yoga breathing techniques time Great math buddy you’re contact five people, that’s still better contact 20. won’t eliminate risk, reduce it. 

My job forces semi-regular contact four people office, it’s perfect, it’s still better 100 people used contact with.  massachusetts checking in. thought nailed.

gonna bad winter This. (attempting) make fun drink raw milk bc think it’s superior. 

Some states US allowed sell it. couple local farmers markets sell near me, constantly saying amazing is. 

Personally, think milk disgusting. Milk products awesome, couldn’t pay drink glass milk.

Moron. Suicides Victoria 2019 August 27th - 468

Suicides Victoria 2020 August 27th - 466 possibly know that? Death might nice enlightening experience comes ask name country going economic boom right locking rest Europe total lockdown. Hey guys one man lived! fiiine.

Moron. couple hundred most. 6 beer half bottle scotch. seem nothing better , math. 3% mortality rate 116 people assuming spread , doubtful best Hopefully isolation requirement NZ's end dropped pronto now. God want holiday. store remind wear one claim exemption sort believe you, allowed tell leave angry disruptive. Hehe, *anti body* stand principles individual liberties much heavier toll pay. best chance would catch new virus spread one infected community identify virus isolate could even that. Organizations like PREDICT source that? can't image anyone saying tests better antigen ones People aren’t going take seriously personally affects death rate high enough. death rate 99% ppl got die 48 hours like virus movie Outbreak, ppl would serious it. lives saved controlled already cause celebration. Even flares back again, starts zero, easily managed going forward.

US estimates another 100k dead vaccine. wartime death numbers prevented.

AU damn good job countries region world. means hell lot lives saved vaccine day. OCD washing hands time. took decades get diagnosed way portrayed media. Don’t even get started gun thing. It’s disgusting baffling. think especially unlikely 20x official daily numbers results half population show 10x infected got infected last 24 hours.

If 50,000 people (or even 25000 people) infected daily basis results would much higher would hundreds thousands active infections.

These 25,000 got infected number different days, perhaps dotted around period 1-2 weeks. ... lemme get straight ...

We stop virus finally get UBI economic policies?

🧐

Well, ... Let's get started immediately! 😁👍👍 yes shrinking pools 1 means everyone gets tested. point pooling possible infection rate low. Even pools 5 means need 1m tests test 5m pools. arguing point, flight know, remember people Wuhan dropping floor lack oxygen back January. I'm doctor, lower level oxygen altitude worsen condition? Aye, treatment improved knowledge virus improved. But, prevented upwards 200 people dying daily basis country, number people hospitals increasing significantly. Average daily hospitalisations country around 50 August, 200 September, 700 October, last couple weeks averaging somewhere around 1,000. So, see going 200 people losing lives daily basis point time. calculated period March July, 28% people admitted hospital Covid lost lives.

In United States, believe loss life toll averaging around 1,000 people day.

So, treatment may improved data telling us enough prevent large numbers people losing lives.

There also unwanted by-product people saved need care resources hospital, thereby increasing demand scarce resources.

Again, looking vaccines improved treatment pie sky point time. need action stamp root minimise number people admitted hospital is: everyone following basic, tried tested social distancing principle. researchers said given proteins fats body fluids also significantly increase virus survival times, study may help explain apparent persistence virus cool experts expressed doubt actual threat posed surface transmission since coronavirus mostly transmitted people cough, sneeze also evidence spread particles hanging lab tests found virus survive two three days bank notes glass, six days plastic stainless steel, though results Ron Eccles, former director Common Cold Centre Cardiff University, criticized Australian study said suggestion virus could survive 28 days causing “unnecessary fear spread surfaces mucus coughs sneezes dirty fingers study use fresh human mucus vehicle spread virus,” told mucus hostile environment viruses contains lots white cells produce enzymes destroy viruses also contain antibodies chemicals neutralize viruses,” Eccles said.
“In opinion infectious viruses persist hours mucus surfaces rather days,” added.

Surface transmission irrelevant, people get people. Jesus H Christ people, almost year y'all still uninformed fuck. wonder get cases every single day. ... exits via window. That's true. I'm sure got downvoted genuine. locked SAD must suck, imagine would make much harder winter. Good luck friend! What? literally hundreds millions doses made right NOW. Walmart hosting three super-spreader Black Friday events year, instead cancelling originally intended. Opening 5 am, long lines, people crowding around coughing one another grab cheaply made electronics, poor quality jeans, thin plastic containers crack month.

^(This satire. Look press release.) test positive immediately contact. virus body several days - even 2 full weeks - show symptoms all. That's they're giving 2 weeks off. may sick now, within next 2 weeks well may come positive.  Yawn. People survive month two without socializing. current level population, viruses come. Locking people homes heads detrimental health might they're catching many people attending, I'm afraid. I'm saying politicians lie before, 2016 feels like reality matter anymore anything, they'll lie even smallest things one cares. think going get worse. No, mass production distribution vaccine alone take years. That's people accept it. he’s stupid/lazy actually anything presidential.  Pence technically charge coronavirus “task force.”  doesn’t anything lie though. Nurses doctors spot random employees/assistants become nurses replace them.. It’s trumps fault Yeah Fauci playing politics here.....

Fucking ridiculous 50% chance false positive result.

But antigen test nearly zero change false positive results. Funny look anything pro china propaganda source. Wow. Lihai! People like die corona, simple Hong Kong news paper despite owned Jack still often criticizes mainland. Trapping people ramming vehicle peaceful? unaware. Germany say ""Tjo, dumm gelaufen, wa?"" thing quarantine rules US joke. know someone got tested positive, still went vacation. Unpopular opinion: north England behaved, wouldn’t need mini-lockdown Fauci said worry This. lot, than, results accomplished typical contact tracing accomplished simply people also independently tested isolated. ""because sounds impossible you""

Yeah, that's intuition works, dude. snippet previous article describing concept: ""*is developing breathalyzer disposable nanosensors using AI-powered cloud-based analysis*"". buzz word ratio nearly chart one sentence alone. see scams nearly identical phrasing pitched time. 

They prey people understand technology works. make fancy looking video, pack many buzzwords per second it, let money pour Kickstarter Indigogo. disappear millions dollars.

Is one legit? Maybe. hope actually. *that exact sentiment* gets people exploited scammed. say 100% sure scam. said hold claims get independent verification fall it. last thing need voters approving $100 Million country buy bunch find garbage. (an example otherwise good technology screwed goes on. Skepticism survival trait everyone exercise. Yes, could possible outcome depends mutated variant get. Currently variants 20A.EU1 20A.EU2 D614G becoming prevalent Europe, latter one know binding power already infectious D614G strain. Tiktok live Maryland like two Americas living side-by-side… walk city dog mouse see people eating crowded breweries restaurants unmasked hugging sharing cups meet eyes masked wait staff look sad. Honestly get angry want yell large groups people walking street without masks can’t even imagine angry people 1 year = forever apparently understand comment, seems. Science process, single end result. point, president dismissing evidence (as trying get at, historically science gives ""wrong""answer sometimes, corrected) basis of... gut feeling? That's point. better alternative based evidence reasoning. That's profoundly naive frankly idiotic statement.

Look, I'll agree discussion waste time. missed forest trees. Yeah nothing says nanny state stopping people dying novel virus. Ironically thats likely hinder help here. tories opposed another lockdown Labour, although almost certainly still pass everyone exhausted isolated much. Pre eye test. People seem care more. wear mask stuff go shops that's minor inconvenience them. people enough able see friends family losing jobs. earth golf banned?! opposed American propoganda used to. may propoganda still truth. previously wiped everything down, frozen items reasons. Seems survives easily frozen packaging. It’s surfaces it’s people inside. early voted waited line 7am 8:30 vote. 15 minutes voting actually started line outdoors, however, don’t feel bad (but man behind didn’t wear mask building, two men front came separately started talking). nonpaywalled full Surprise surprise. bastion trumpism gets rona. Obesity asthma. Covid tipping point. relative said shortness breath flight, yeah...entirely agree post - different state. student test positive last week, I’m close contact. Also, three students quarantined, outside 6’ radius seat. 6’1” - absolutely fine. course everyone sits completely still move chair all. point, US politicians quite obviously made decision shoot herd immunity, science damned.

Of course, population testing positive every week people going around things normal, half cases presymptomatic, contact tracing going fail. Spirit Airlines, Megabus sky. America needs serious, serious, discussion schools. 

It appears open schools may contributing community spread. don’t know data fucking suppressed.

We deserve information truth.

Then decide priorities society compensate teachers essential workers “economy saviors.” used take meds it. awful actually get covid. I’m immune knows long stop stressing giving covid people. Hells yeah Australia. doughnut us unfortunate folk Yeah, remote learning uni now. We’ve managed get 0 cases community transmission yesterday. keep primary schools open remote learning high school up. First: employees value job little, employees longer. 

Second: Require doctors note. live Germany it’s like live works. break leg job relies walking, take multiple months paid sick leave, heal properly, don’t worry job. 

And well... german Economy still slob, obviously stuff still gets done. studies saying last long? prospect effective vaccine low; much lower ever been, given several close applying approval within coming months. China making advances areas science. AI lead country number published papers. really large scale possible repeat times everyone gets caught. 

Yeah it'll huge undertaking, really better way fighting virus short term. Victoria may cleaned second wave well states also get recognition making another mess first place. didn’t easy accident. point call doctor? I've cough go away appointments coming up.. cancel call tomorrow? sensitivity test? Nope bog roll boogaloo states, too. Really gotta order bidet... Uh, go Texas Florida coronavirus subs. They're there. again, parents simply listen care, long free daycare remains available. 

  two high schoolers (athletes) middle schooler. Fairly large district. schools seem strict masks distancing. also plastic barriers desks ends tables cafeteria. It’s perfect scenario better nothing right?
  Anyway, we’ve school 8 weeks limited spread. 

This rationalization finest. many kids *regularly tested?* takes 2-10 days symptoms show up, *if do*. honestly believe school districts would risk *funding* admit efforts useless due inevitable result? that's real issue; simply funding manpower enforce standards 24/7. admitted everyone brain knows, kids groups (even high schoolers) spreaders *any type germ,* mask no, parents would froth mouth demand government defund them. 

Like not, one major contributor increase state national numbers, even places like Hawaii Alaska, neither state tied mainland, opening schools. serious COVID-19, we'd mandate learning online (except absolutely necessary cases like special ed). want free babysitting, we'll gladly kill hundreds thousands. also people previously COVID-19 got it. test positive, quarantine people household. supposed call doctor inform check symptoms. 10 days, symptoms last 3 days, free. develope symptoms, doctor tell maybe check regularly. general 10 day quarantine apply free doctor says, guess. Enforced? who? Coronaviruses among best understood viruses. one new (hence ""novel"") takes design vaccine one fairly soon. Same. never stopped anything normally know things like echinacia actually work rest intended, know people say ""boost"" immune system. 

The last thing want days Covid infection boost immune system anyway, since overactive immune system causes body harm overreaction. That's use steroids, depress immune system. 

People need leave dial alone. Take nutrients body use, laypeople try *self-medicate* anything supposed change immune system works (if indeed that's medicine does.) worked Maine, granted Maine isolated NY is. Wash damn mask throw away gets gross think even accuracy 60-70, caught 25k people. Yay. hoping 25k people sensible enough stay home responsible. Tetrameter, diphthongize ""poem"" one syllable, unconventional (but necessarily wrong bad). anti-vax dipshit vaccines all, get wrong, sure specifics. vaccine actually works since SARS MERS? understand vaccine could ready pandemic otherwise. We're gonna see 1,000 deaths day pretty soon, we? things equal, tests identify individual cases, yes. excel thing still makes chuckle think it

The government tracking pandemic stats using glorified calculator 😂😂😂 assumption meant doesn’t match said. much bs avoid saying 200 people without technically lying guess. B-b-but it’s freedom selfish put people’s lives risk!!/s Yes points valid course. also called super spreaders infections long time could potentially identified this. 

We figure 2-3 weeks antigen test impact complete waste money. locking put us position May that's poised another wave. China used lockdown set system would deter future outbreaks lockdowns, least lengthy ones, would unneeded future. US push SPH orders without making plan control future outbreaks pointless. no, saying lockdown real plan. Italy shocked many people ate white bread and/or pastries seemingly everyday, yet thin. Obviously consider whole picture though. Convincing seems lack control arm study. large scale phase 3 trials conducted CDC someone linked below. Also, evidence currently suggests COVID causing low vitamin D. Better people spreading work causing lot sick coworkers. Hurts company paying sick leave one person days. 

And real flu (not bad cold) pretty serious, reason lot people die flu every year. yeah, people (at least here) go doctor flu. 

But yeah, somewhat waste time. companies require note sick 3 days reduce unnecessary doctors visits. overall, people go doctor get note stuff like this. it’s covered insurance. Yes, happen everyone? Yeah they're called pharmacies. know many flu vaccines given year? Haha I'm living UK I'm waiting first lockdown happen, mate.

It's lockdown nobody bothered enforce one. Goddamn offices schools open, too. We've listening ~~anti~~ American trolls tell us Covid fake.

FTFY Yes, clearly many places know care enough get right ones. Couple fact many people COVID infections fever decent portion infection, end something basically useless. anyone else noticed trend couples going shopping woman wearing mask man isn't? keep seeing time seems bizarre me. think one thought virus serious she'd convince partner wear mask. think guy anti-masker want girl wearing one. Oh, always women wearing men going barefaced. weird. crazy part morons starting “I’m wearing mask keeping distance! don’t help all!” 

Then SECOND someone love gets infected die it’s bullshit “oH DiDn’t kNoW” try make life example do. 

Other people see, say they’re faking it, cycle repeats. - Slovakia China, even small country Eastern Europe handle logistics, certain self proclaimed superpower should.

B - research topic, China already eradicated multiple clusters way.

C - See A, Slovakia get many, surely self proclaimed richer countries should. political, economical. hardly party denying corona, problem closing schools creates society parents usually work reach reasonable income. want studies worth researching. That’s fascism works. “Immigrants lazy, welfare freeloaders, also want take job”

Fascists believe they’re told believe Europe moved back towards lockdown, total lockdown not, least places. much freedom movement employment, far fewer emergency powers April.


For example, country could leave house reason April, except 1 hour exercise within 2km home, collect groceries medicine deliver cocooned person, imminently essential workplaces stayed open, required letter travel work. holiday home staying partners house Sunday lockdown came effect midnight, bad - home restrictions lift unless essential worker. 

This enforceable enforced emergency powers.

Now restriction back place, except milder every count police longer enforce emergency powers. consider lockdown, nothing close total lockdown. Interaction reduced still many people cars streets time. Far businesses open. People travelling others houses much April although restriction technically (with wider exceptions). Police cannot force turn home back holiday home. Nonetheless R number robustly 1. Could argue that, wrongly?

Total shutdown businesses 8-12 weeks government money private lending, full opening afterwards much less impactful business probably March2020 February2021 variably-reduced level business longer least testing widely available NY. might well get tested come instead waiting line 5 hours like guys states normally do. I'm defending model. would much rather countries followed Taiwan South Korea's trajectory development, China force reckoned quickly catching terms development. antigens 4€ PCR 60€ think. sure tho lot expensive. thing. north texas, gets cold like Canada cold. wore mask cold day (42f) thought, nice! 90% media leftist think Andrews second coming Jesus call bollocks media thing. ask Andrews tough questions. like Peta Credlin expose incompetent corrupt government led hotel fiasco.  B wins, attempt lockdown etc, probably end worsening violence

Idk, let's say country locks - violence come from? bunch yahoos flags pickup trucks driving around ... exactly? Everyone side going inside. 

Are T-lovers going riot? whine ""rioters"" every damn day. need fucking arrested. police cooperate, need fired arrested too. think virus cares. USA easy shit least logistics COVID drive throughs.

We'll March-April at-risk people healthcare workers expected vaccinated then. That's really true, saying exists JOrdan Peterson's imagination. Celiac Mono checking in. :( Yep, months stuck home kids, want get rid 8 hours day. dont care many people die get sick it, long get 8 hours day, dont deal kids. Yeah miss April? 😂 Breathomix working making SpiroNose breathalyzer detect COVID-19 since beginning May request Dutch government. 

They worked together multiple hospitals, university government make working test test capabilities. test already used great effect hospitals major testing street Amsterdam ago, results promising. Netherlands probably see mass deployment breathing test somewhere month next month goes well. Lol several EU countries Australia did. Cool, cops able arrest people coronavirus now. thread police arresting people event London... dicking relevant. Wisconsin 5% hospitalized. lot people bad symptoms aren’t admitted, sent home even extreme fatigue struggling breathe. getting numbers? Peru worst COVID-19 death rate, 1,029 deaths per million; Belgium second 905.

Belgium followed Bolivia, Brazil, Spain, Chile Ecuador, death rates 700-per-millions.

Mexico seventh deadliest country COVID-19, 677 deaths per million.

The U.S. coronavirus mortality rate currently 671 per million, higher rate U.K., 650 per million.

Similarly, U.S. highest total confirmed infections — 8.3 million date — world. seven countries higher infections per capita, Mail noted.

Bahrain leads world per capita infections, 46,372 cases per 1 million people.
The small Persian Gulf nation followed Qatar, Israel, Panama, Kuwait, Peru Chile. U.S. next list, 25,184 cases per one million.

Germany ranked 54th 12.1 deaths per 100,000 US 67.14 deaths per see data wearing mask, social distancing shutdowns **DO** work ! apps that. need 500 person party. Masks become new normal way became new normal Spanish flu epidemic ended. (evidence clinical studies CONCLUDE, I’ll accept data. then, evidence anecdotal. think things get bit complicated would comparing one day's death figure stock cases would last multiple days. 100 cases, 5 deaths day case lasted 20 days, 'death rate' calculation would 5% every case would ended death. Cool. infrastructure place get people need them? Sure...but 9 MILLION lower???? use corner card. understand it, Slovakia attempting eradicate virus, like China does. use rapid antigen test false negatives PCR wouldn’t work. different strategy China. attacking Covid propaganda would simplest ever.

Keep mouth shut let work.

America would never know what/who hit them. come Slovakia means hear struggling test people? thought always liked make known better gasp ""Eastern"" country. Many people simply want allow Sweden rewrite history - something they're obviously trying do. FOMO really bad even Iowa, making Florida solidarity haha. dumbass governers citizens apparently.
I'm one worst counties yet everyone acting like hunkydory. nurse friend telling theyre antidepressants trying keep together since nearby hospital almost capacity flu season starting. friends went hitting 200+ wedding. feel like I'm jerk baffled it. Again, several European countries Australia did. cannot control borders effectively Australia can. They're way dependent free movement people goods (and that's counting tourism). Yes, doesn' matter. point find isolate many positive peopoe possible quickly isolate order flatten curve 1918 flu many many long term effects...... ask President Wilson!!! Antigen test specificity &lt; PCR test specificity. allows significant false testing results. Think initial NFL testing results. doctor's note cold flu? one goes doctor things. would enormous waste doctors' time. certainly are, kids home means parents home means people work means economy go phhffttt. new totals? Yeah understand risk worth testing immunity, immunity hundreds people work.
But know mean, heard cases well. 1) Damn, forgot broken ass health system... still, thought norm insurance employed? always unterstood uninsured mostly people working? shouldn’t basic things covered?

And would doctors note require 4 hours urgent care? Can’t go usual doctor instead hospital?

2) No, would fire people abusing sick leave suggesting really sick every Friday?

And believe lot people want work all. Even Germany unlimited social aid unemployed, nearly every unemployed wants work, that’s really negative prejudiced view people. However, lots people want bad conditions treated like expendable machinery. 

3) Going single case opinion whole country? Germaniens jobless rate bit higher US pre Covid spike anywhere bad US. currently still lower. 
Of course system perfect yeah, relatively hard find job eg. older. worker protections better, employed lot harder employer fire US, bit careful hire. 
But overall, hard get job. 

And even unemployed, unconditional government aid. Sure, it’s luxurious means, home food table. vitamin capsules. England island too. Look they're doing.


Australia showed world get cases virus already there. Temporary hard lock downs local travel restrictions. What’s ~3m cases outcome? information there; parents listening. Objectively, give rat's ass schools teachers; rather, want raise children 24/7. That's really issue. Nothing PR. enforced can't enforced. nothing talk. read aymptomatic cases counted cases China. concerned getting st Nicholas shopping done lockdown everyone runs mall. Yes mask helps. still see many wearing wrong everyday. Exposing nose. Grab car driver pulled mask rider. airing vehicle one passenger another. Many places crowded. Low number making people complacent. 

All disaster making. need constantly remind explosion cases could easily happen. really blame though? really good food combined zero incentive go outside due shit weather boring geography entire country. It’s like they’re Colorado California state actually looks nice. I’ve actually said thing threads... America become anti-intelligence. called IGNORANCE Misinformation. texas's second wave really. never got hit hard march initial lockdown. Sure happen 50 percent cases suggested! False positive ration 0.32 based specification tests (1 person 311 - compare PCR). antigen test perfect would need PCR tests. course false positive. I'm sure plenty administration mistakes. mean whole concept wrong.

There also many cases PCR tests people positive negative positive. Meaning test perfect limitations. That's correct. 

There strong scientific evidence, infection transmission 14 low. Children teachers test positive almost certainly bringing home. 

14 different case altogether. groups maybe prone COVID like adults frankly, opinion, terrible social distancing.

The key thing remember education childcare people need stop spreading disinformation point. includes teachers seem forgotten role (thankfully that's tiny minority ranting Facebook). majority teachers amazing work proud achieved.

Education foundational building block modern society. teaches children young adults key social skills professional skills required develop society. good mental development wellbeing countries made LAW children must attend school. Finally, children broken homes see schools universities safe space (and food) away issues. guess ask question thinks important balanced discussion power education institutions governments trying keep open. TIL. That's pretty cool. Several EU countries worse per capita US right lol Actually...its like 31% lingering effects! Eh, high level yes.

At individual level thought beyond ""fuck you, I'm ok I'll want."" real test happens life goes back normal. virus pick steam banished completely. Second question economy doing. home country Canada seen small business sector absolutely decimated. Russian disinformation campaign. sources credible.  disagree, time there's always going outliers flout rules majority people compliant government started conflicting rules. told scientists government experts social distancing keeping large group social interactions outdoors, would keep spread down. within space 3 weeks, every single school, college university reopened government gave entire country massive discount get us restaurants. 

Social distance, go back school?
Social distance, save pret?
Social distance, get back office jobs?

Yes, going parties, going bars, clubs, etc self inflicted ridiculous, contradictory messages government ever since Cummings got exposed.
  kept cases low, throughout summer, government mandates directly responsible rise cases. opened schools, give funding guidance safely. I'm going blame working class parents sending children school day, they're already struggling put bread table. spent time money making sure safe, sent back anyway. I, teacher, feel like sacrifice gods economy. necessarily no. intially PCR test considered equivalent infectivity/virulence, understood people could still test positive even successful recovery infection would considered contagious. 
 
  forgot ""I think we've done great job"". Also throw fact summer Australia localized outbreaks exponential growth naturally slows down. major outbreak quickly contain it, stop spread 1/2 generations contact chain. 

By contrast Canada (which 98 percent Australia) struggling fall yet break much bigger. taking much longer typically break chains 3/4 generations now. summer 1/2 generation in. 

Come winter god knows happen. messaging 6 months [**2021-05-01 15:26:58 UTC**](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2021-05-01%2015:26:58%20UTC%20To%20Local%20Time) remind [**this send PM also reminded reduce spam.

^(Parent commenter ) [^(delete message hide sure already occurring sure risk factor. 

I'm saying that--in addition everything happening COVID acted far--we entering extremely high risk period. 

Instead situations identified outliers, far prevalent. would still herd immunity. RemindMe! 6 Months senior State Department official tested positive coronavirus trip Europe angered diplomats irritated foreign officials could infected. Lots parties US. 

I live major urban area bars allowed open, must opened last night only. Downtown looked like Halloween 2019 Nobody likes overcrowded hospitals It’s really political. idiot interview made incredibly inaccurate statements. I’m sure give Fox News. [archive link anyone trouble accessing article That's wondering about. Although think we're considering reported cases 10x number includes asymptomatic. agree standard number seems fit Texas. We'll probably wait know.  would take many years everyone actually get infected. We've person since early September, short break going remote weeks ago. 

Parents straight lied to. (elementary school) distancing. extra cleaning, beyond once-a-week spray kind chemical. tell kids pull masks 497 times day. deliberately pulling down, slide need reminders. 

We told sternly post pictures videos one kid time would show little distancing is. 

Kids tested. symptoms, parents keep home two weeks instead getting test. parent take child doctor came back note said allergies. Funny, ""allergies"" showed Monday gone week later. Yes, almost definitely cold totally twisted doctor's arm lied saying allergies. since. (My students young tend know extremely well.) 

All cases schools staff members athletes, notifications slow going out. staff member building diagnosed reported positive test work Tuesday morning. notified Thursday evening. 

So (general you) think kids' schools well actually work school, would highly, highly, HIGHLY suspicious hearing whole truth. Americans stupid! /s Yeah three weeks ago Welsh counties lockdown. couple weeks ago counties locked whole country. Ah, cool! Makes sense “Look outside! look like Biden becomes president” /s No,my Dr,met parking full gear,masks,shield gloves administer test. talking about, work people 65, parents 65.

There recomendations restrictions making prisoners. 

They prisoners never were. 

Are making stuff source this? Lol yeah mine longer even revolves around hygiene all. house mess. Stereotypes annoying. start buying supplements now. Yes. Haha push buttons card machine? Same. least still autism use excuse. really sweet understand well loud crowds, time really strange people take risk overstimulated aspie meltdown serious than, know, dying ventilator. Broken, record. 

Broken, record.

Broken, record. Chinese weren’t restricted actually followed rules far superior track trace do. ‘These people’ don’t want punish anybody, can’t even begin describe stupid sounds. ‘Wear face covering, shop online, we’re sadistic want sad?’ Twat. It’s simple rules simple people incapable following large public group? Fuck no. gonna one wearing mask concert football game? Every nation concentrate lockdown provide regular food medicines 💊 hope you’re right Humans breathed humans millenea. There's nothing insane it. What's insane fearing people point think everyones existence threat without mask Dude shitting right now? COVID once. beat it. can't get set amount time unless exposed unearthly dose. never contagious covid due immunity immunity wears off.

I'm posting this. WTF said staying home I'm letting people breathe me. Strangers. Fuck that. humbleness admirable. Im fortunate grown household parents work hard teach meaning kindness compassion.

That’s ironic say that, I’m actually way today drop bunch old jackets socks donated clothing local food &amp; clothing bank, I’ll add $25 donation name u/bzzus I’m it.

Stay healthy. importantly continue preach humble kind. world needs ever. splendid Sunday yourself, friend! I'm person originally replied to, agree person they're useless. right infected people always fever, temperature-check stations screen one definitive symptoms virus. live, I'm pretty sure anyone substantial fever would isolated taken test right away. Results come within 24 hours. positive, contract tracing commences. least think that's idea. 

It's shame Pittsburgh crap thermometers, ones use South Korea pretty good, think. part effort detect anyone might need test. 

Just 2 cents. 

I definitely agree kind breathalyser thing would great. Cult ideology politics turned 11 rest life? Given Russia “attacked democracy” Putin greatest threat world wouldn’t want US spread anti-lockdown propaganda Russia? No, it’s not. governments website accurately describes restrictions. still leave home. Yeah I’m barber although customers wear mask still wouldn’t know  gave me. friends realized long ago people give shit themselves, really friends mostly use ass whatever agenda have.

There exceptions, though. Exactly. Like can't believe let people breathe us before. two friends give flak going CONCERT Halloween party 20-30 people held indoors.

Looks like wrong hahaha. **Key Points**

**Question** construction work associated increased community transmission coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) disproportionate morbidity among construction workers US cities?

**Findings** decision analytical model COVID-19 found resuming construction work shelter-in-place orders associated increased hospitalization risks construction workforce increase transmission surrounding community. Based COVID-19 hospitalization data August 20, 2020, construction workers nearly 5-fold increased risk hospitalization central Texas compared occupational categories.

**Meaning** findings study suggest enacting workplace safety policies providing paid sick leave could protect essential workers high-contact industries prevent widening disparities COVID-19 morbidity mortality.

**Abstract**

**Importance** Policy makers relaxed restrictions certain nonessential industries, including construction, jeopardizing effectiveness social distancing measures putting already at-risk populations greater risk coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. Texas, Latinx populations overly represented among construction workers, thus elevated rates exposure compounded prevalent high-risk comorbidities lack access health care.

**Objective** assess association construction work COVID-19 pandemic hospitalization rates construction workers surrounding community.

**Design, Setting, Participants** decision analytical model used mathematical model COVID-19 transmission, stratified age risk group, construction workers modeled explicitly. model based residents Austin–Round Rock metropolitan statistical area, population 2.17 million. Based 500 stochastic simulations 15 scenarios varied size construction workforce level worksite transmission risk, association continued construction work hospitalizations estimated compared anonymized line-list hospitalization data central Texas August 20, 2020.

**Exposures** Social distancing interventions, size construction workforce, level disease transmission construction worksites.

**Main Outcomes Measures** scenario, total number COVID-19 hospitalizations relative risk hospitalization among construction workers projected compared relative risks estimated reported hospitalization data.

**Results** Allowing unrestricted construction work associated increase COVID-19 hospitalization rates mid-August 2020 0.38 per 1000 residents 1.5 per 1000 residents 0.22 per 1000 construction workers 9.3 per 1000 construction workers. increased risk estimated offset safety measures (such thorough cleaning equipment uses, wearing protective equipment, limits number workers worksite, increased health surveillance) associated 50% decrease transmission. observed relative risk hospitalization among construction workers compared occupational categories among adults aged 18 64 years 4.9 (95% CI, 3.8-6.2).

**Conclusions Relevance** findings study suggest unrestricted work high-contact industries, construction, associated higher level community transmission, increased risks at-risk workers, larger health disparities among members racial ethnic minority groups. Even without Covid sounds terrible u/tb0x provide evidence, invented claim. 

You **completely** aware order white bloodcells COMBAT virus, first enter you. 

You spreading deliberate false claim order justify deserting safety measures going polite wanting leave potentially kill people. Well everyone else “fuck got mine” attitude shouldn’t I? get coughed day long work I’m going get Covid I’ll get work pub. one  also illegal kill others. link actual study methodology, one page summary? checked website, find anything. political post... Blah blah. Basically, couple issues. PCR tests, accuracy rough topic, course organization nightmarish concern regarding safety testing (massess, lines) thing. still, 22.580 people tested positive yesterday, helpful timely quarantene. personally see good thing, much wasnt clear tesring begun. Theoretically essential elements society like water filtration workers etc. would make difficult successfully pull off. Parents testing kids school. Kid gets sick something: Parent chooses keep home 14 days instead getting tested. spreading covid around classroom cold? *big shrug* idea. happens again. 

I teach 4 year olds. starting sound like broken record. also acting like celebrity. 

Case point: Havent seen Birx months til quit task force. certainly part global West anyway! didn’t say don’t go see friends don’t got crowded bars yet simply despite bore are. Far less would needed get Covid control.

There issues accessible many demographics. blown off. need planning infrastructure beyond currently use. mean covid vaccines work, need accounted for. far seen nothing solutions problem. vaccine released hopefully planning come. Member pretty much Western groups like EU NATO 15+ years. Also part Schengen zone within EU since 2007 part eurozone since 2009.

Also way life pretty much westernized unless live backwater village.

We still ways go order catch terms civil society corruption, reason got 40+ years part Eastern block courtesy decision world powers WWII. citizens tried rebel back 1968, got Soviet tanks answer prolonged visit 20+ years.

Prior part Central Europe hundreds years WWI Czechoslovakia one democratic places developed nations planet. primary factor diet. *Sigh* know service industry blue collar jobs work way bourgeois sinecures, right? One favorite Churchill though large tracts Europe many old famous States fallen may fall grip Gestapo odious apparatus Nazi rule, shall flag fail. shall go end. shall fight France, shall fight seas oceans, shall fight growing confidence growing strength air, shall defend island, whatever cost may be. shall fight beaches, shall fight landing grounds, shall fight fields streets, shall fight hills; shall never surrender, even if, moment believe, island large part subjugated starving, Empire beyond seas, armed guarded British Fleet, would carry struggle, until, God's good time, new world, power might, steps forth rescue liberation old. comes huge cost. Chinese committing genocide Uighurs right now. Chinese citizens subject grotesque Orwellian monitoring problem get worse technology improves.

The Chinese government able plan years advance rather decades *because Communist Party doesn’t worry voted power*. debate whether liberal democracy unresponsive inefficient 1930s. resolution sacrifice great deal order avoid horrors totalitarianism. lesson forgotten less 80 years. Sweden better anyone tbh

It’s called freedom live life without government forcing 

You make decisions health, whether want you. want stay home stay home. want live life, live life. True, though least go bankrupt medical bills Echinacea, elderberry , turmeric contraindicated there’s risk cytokine storm, prominent feature Covid. don’t want boost immune system it’s already mounting overreaction. Probably forgot wash hands took mask off. simply touched eyes even mask on.

COVID transmitted via touch, masks one line defense. take *all* precautions, like building 20ft high wall leaving gate open. Thanksgiving party call dinner. people go it. sounds like opening scene extremely shitty horror movie arrive conclusion copycat? See [my comment Spain first lockdown.. true UBI, guaranteed minimum wage expectations. seen huge victory left, set stay place pandemic.

It's start. numbers gonna grow larger cold coming everyone like summer.

Second wave joke thats probably why. anyone thinks solution nCOV19 place people free COVID allowlist? (Allowlist new whitelist :) ) 


What put folks disallowed list means quarantine. tackle coronavirus district district? Test everyone bundled 14 days quarantine. cleared, go live normal life. 

Doesn't make sense? companies mean? find unsurprising I'm glad think mental physical health, poverty health issues put hold minor annoyances republican party killed people.  imagine work public amid pandemic essential worker going develop many drug addiction mental disorder...working retail stressful enough. RCT would easy... heard joke yet. need get more.

Oh, wait... Houston would like word 50k? 50k what? IUs?

Didn't realize people prescribed vitamin D. Figured doc would recommend supplementation. That's literally point government. govern. make decisions.

Check Charter Rights Freedoms. Amendable necessary. Fair point, think that! virus isnt seasonal flu, true.  dry cold air low humidity indoors might help virus aerosolize stay suspended air longer.  Also people tend crowd bit indoors colder weather.  also seasonal vitamin deficiency people sneezing coughing common colds may unaware covid status.

There many factors increase viruses ability spread play fall winter It’s meant used first test masses. way, PCR - costly invasive - reserved detected. I’d interested know false positive negatives. now, 90% would pretty decent step cases rallies going keep growing. attendees go general population spread it. filling hospitals.  2 points listed exactly feel huge problem here.
“You can’t tell do, rights!”
And president making followers believe doctors making it’s big deal.
It didn’t like this, is, sucks. We’ll hopefully get this, it’s kind depressing seeing countries work together fight us Americans divided. I’m tired people acting like mask end all. live somewhere 100% mask compliance cases still rising. question get stupid responses supposed unmasked people parties coughing other. Sorry theories aren’t cutting anymore. real cause masks aren’t working well supposedly places like Vietnam? general health? Lack obesity? Stress levels generally better immune system? Something genetic? I’m sick news saying “it go away people wear masks” going daily life everyone masks cases still rising Resurgence prohibition era indigenous people* running water relocation relocation denied access. yeah, shit changed still eugenically genocidal, embarassment horrorshow nation souls. Fuck that! moral outrage racist cruelty fucked-up Administration tearing apart families (esp child separation) extend Native Americans*. [/rant]

OK called Native Americans, aren't. depends context. podcasts ""Native America Calling"" YouTube channel ""OsiyoTV"" bring nature. Native America Calling often, lot interviews. Saturday mean? first day month new case number decreased previous days. hasn’t decreasing past Saturdays. Perhaps hitting peak rise start trend weeks Halloween cases catch us. trump wins expect fire fauci  Imagine clean one said easy anyone, problem people easy life never learned cope properly. Now's time develop coping skills. Republicans made many states mail ballots counted election day I'm fine approach taken France (which appears thing UK) I'm fine idea calling ""lockdown"". Sorry, lockdown. called restrictions, something else like that. Like, streets busy Paris restrictions started Friday morning. I'm fine let's call lockdown  sure you’re getting downvoted aside probably people blatantly ignore guidelines. never forget seeing patient mine go Dr. explain needs intubated well. asked going call family would happen. 

I basically give hope say he's getting care best nurses ICU closely monitored. 

He died month later 46 years old 2 kids. I'm never going forget going BiPAP breathing 60 breaths minute gowned toes mask, can't see face scared know what's going on. never forget felt like body experience giving someone news screaming outside shift let anger. watch. Time magazine dubbed Dr Fauci “person year” Anything effective vaccine sounds really good. 

But here's part gives pause researchers measured antibody levels group 121 found slight drop three months five months symptoms. larger decline 148 days, antibody levels still high enough neutralize virus. 

It's good 92% still enough antibodies 5 month mark, starting see bigger decline right 5 month mark little unsettling. That's lot time. 

They going study people least year, we'll know while. Fake poor choice words. ""Manipulate"" accurate.

You encourage discourage testing many ways. provide fewer tests, delay processing, create longer waits, use less reliable tests, make tests expensive, reduce clinic hours, etc. 

Testing's one big advantage weeks earlier deaths. disadvantage inherent inaccuracy (for reasons above), willful random. course do. Wont condemn white supremacists, problem trying condemn doctor trying help public. Hmmm Many island nations same, there's reason COVID ravaging Caribbean right now. It’s pretty easy say “I’m responsible States residents” can’t get TV “require” things states. RI setting restrictions summer even threatened SUE NY. Guess residents year? Everywhere! 

VT quarantine guidelines one follows those. fair say yet inmates running asylum? everybody do. going cost less economic stimulus “In response, Atlas tweeted: ""#Insecurity #EmbarrassingHimself #Exposed #CantThrowABall #NoTimeForPolitics,"" making reference Fauci's first pitch Washington Nationals game summer.”

Our apparent leaders. “El Paso firefighters trenches COVID-19 pandemic, cannot talk record number people picking every day El Paso's international bridges.

As result appear escalating ambulance responses international bridges El Paso Fire Department, KFOX14’s source insists city El Paso left dangerously vulnerable position.” mean metrics, Australia freer country US. Could addressed addressed, countries never seemed big priority. also people live pockets Southern US lack many modern conveniences. Also prioritized. actually issue article/type media coverage. People read stuff like - anecdotal evidence-based - think, well people claim everything right still got sick, fuck it. 

In states I've seen data, 50% cases traceable, person knows exactly gave confirmed testing. 50% not. mean sort known high risk activities weeks before. Maybe work store, school construction site, gone parties, dined friends, flew plane, etc. means know directly caught from. good reminder important get tested regularly engage activities.

Then there's sort small minority people anecdotally said low risk things still got sick. live alone left house go walks grocery store dentist essential trip, wore masks, washed hands got home. Even assume people lying forgetting vector contact have, there's evidence indicate experience extreme outlier. 

If we're going fearmonger based anecdotal evidence, might well give credence Trumpie anti-masker idiots run months gotten sick. high-risk family flown 4 5 times Florida since March, go parties every weekend, wear masks, etc. one positive test among them. proof COVID bullshit? No. article proof anything either? No. don’t even understand basic immunology please stop making assertions saying you’re one people actually looking science don’t even understand basic immunology please stop making assertions saying you’re one people actually looking science Imagine COVID numbers would without prevention. Biden right, vaccine coming. guys never heard operational security they? keep highly confidential messages secret, someone watches talking afterwards infer messages said without ever actually seeing them. 

In case someone unblind access trial data (DMC? Regulator? They’re triple blind studies, *someone* knows what’s going on) told highest levels NHS prepare green light 4-6wks, people chain blabbing message cascaded them. 

This outstanding news. face covering, shop online, we’re sadistic want sad?

You're engaging I'm actually saying fun argue strawmen. cases go first lockdown? better contact tracing system? Chinese actually much smarter all? government going differently lockdown? 

Don't get angry government failed continues fail nothing it. want see peer reviewed research that’s I’ve read. They're bots too. annoying. Even /s. sign times 'murica.  ""*The Buck Stops Here*"" sign tossed White House wastebasket. administration lost control, so, enter *blame* endgame. seems 'murica want admit pandemic could handled far better, **was** handled better countries (China, pick country Asia). Unfortunately, administration's ""give fuck"" meter never moved far zero, economy somehow separate COVID - ain't. Get 'murica, statistically among worst infection death rates - poor handling COVID, economy reboot time (probably years).  COVID brought control - whatever means necessary - stuck ditch; beginning feel economic pain disaster. ourselves, reckless combination poor leadership, science bashing, ""I got fucking rights"" citizenry. COVID economy linked. fear *winter coming* 'murica. multiple cultures every country. entirely true. Many Westerners assholes. Japanese mask wearing culture entirely self protection. believe rude spread germs people sick. Korea HK seem picked cos SARS better prepared Covid19.

You ask me, Americans need made clean schools kids, learn sense civic responsibility like Japanese. actually starts there. That's learn socially responsible. Since clean shared public space, learn make mess much work later. lesson expands there.

You ever seen videos Japanese school lunches? Totally makes US look like uncivilized country.  tragedy web browser broke, right URL too!

Everyone! Pity fucking guy who's web browser let leave sub! seems suffering PTSD. hospital staff needs find time therapy, new wave. Let get downvotes:-). Fauci needs stop speaking press. good beginning keeps giving vague comments make sound like one anything prevent Covid, doesn’t offer (new) solutions ideas, occasionally character assassinate someone. don’t know helping way, shape, form. feel like fodder people think overblown surely disease expert would giving specific information situation serious. It’s also infuriating hear people “aren’t taking seriously” people unemployed teaching home wear masks time. also makes Fauci look uninformed acts like certain people answer covid plan exact thing already done, marketed differently  Thanks. It’s better listen though it’s important work they’ve done coordinating names stages everyone referring parts disease discussing it. couldn’t get all. Nope, blocked court nice try Lmao function cells Welcome adult. seems real change speed spread. question moment whether stabilization turns decline number cases. We'll know Tuesday RIVM publishes weekly numbers scheduled press conference. suggestion morons - Listen guy instead pumpkin. freedom stake life loved ones LIFE definitely stake. I’m old little kids, familiar party scene.. but, trick treating low participation compared years. didn’t go.. glow dark party instead kids, snacks, watched Netflix. 

My neighbor pretty cool looking candy tube set big pipe.. threw candy 10 foot long pipe never got close anyone lol COVID related per se matter personal curiosity, cold one normal coronaviruses feel like compared rhinovirus? ""I real problems guy,"" Fauci said Atlas. ""He's smart guy who's talking things believe real insight knowledge experience in. keeps talking things dissect parse out, make sense.""

Uhhh, would care fucking ELABORATE? Christ, Fauci broken record transparent affiliations Democratic Party it’s almost painful 4900 testing state places, aproximately copyring poolling places usually 8 people (2 doctors/nurses/paramedics taking swabs, 2 medical profesionals/pharmaciests/vets/laborants/ processing tests, one soldier, one policeman firefighter 2 administrative workers voulenteers). One place avaragely dealt 60 people/hour, places asked inhabitants come alphabet house numbers, however recomendation every person could come whatever place choosen time. lot responsibility delegated cities villages, mayors organise places testing take place, administrative workforce, food PPE them. lot creative. testing took place buses, one person entered bus, filled form, continued medic took swab got bus door, places military tents outside, inside schools, theatres, drive ins, work good asi planed. Drive ins big capacity airport good, however mayors close city centers big rows cars, waiting time long people causing congested streets, even army vehicles delivering tests certificates got stuck them. even contacted medical staff army provide enough. recieved money invested far gouverment promises send them. gourvenment bought tests printed certificates positivity/negativity filled hand test avoid technical problems. army distributed test, certificates, water, medical stuff (military doctors, 33 austrian army doctors, 200 hungarian medics, huge amount medical stuff voulentarlly called army informing want help, promised 7e/ hour plus 500e took whole weekend shift) operatively dealt problems occured. biggest problem find medical stuff, end people wanted help, respect them, 7 22 PPE, whole weekend week hard work hospitals, clinics, ... also posibility companies 4000 people hospitals medical facilities test employes, families patients own, providing one soldier tests certificates, companies organise places find medical stuff. Also PCR tests Thursday-Sunday accepted. tis interesting affected numbers. People wanted accurate tests want get tested state paid pcr test percentage positivity declined 20% 10% days. Last week lock (you could work, shop groceries pharmacy sport outside region) stop spread minimalise contact people wont many new infections test capture. Without test quarantee 10 days (you go nearest pharmacy, groceries, doctor it, go work wont recieve money 10 days presence required, stay home office boss allows it). negative test next week go work, different types shops dine outside. Last week pilot testing infected regions, teste twice alreaady, resulst interesting. Last week bardejov positivyty rate 3,52%, week far 1,29 %. still decided whole country tested next weekend, plan catch people infection fully developed last week test recognise them. want test least regions higher percentage infected. biggest problems uncertainity testing enough stuff, big quees Saturday morning, got lot better Sunday fact, gouvernment done validation pcr tests even though giving emphasis fact, even though negative certificate still infectious start partying, many people may change mind set borders mostly open. Same! severe allergies persisted even 5 years injections, although treatment significantly reduced them. able get half dose nasal steroid fall nothing else, amazing.

Also, cycling, especially dusty trails.

Plus, masks seem really bother subset trash humans reason... that's kind plus too. Oh yes, did. little issue habeas corpus? American citizens held indefinitely without facing accusers. mention indefinitely collecting ""evidence"" them. 

Whoops. guess 19 years soon! animation landing page oddly soothing. supposed done that? got put useless land, given little national infrastructure access (meaning freeways here), industry apart casinos services. supposed get money it?

I get sovereign, can't tell they'd refuse help someone gave them. always enjoy reading posts! thoughtful person. Thanks summary. really like Pete Buttigieg reason. Harvard graduate, Rhodes Scholar, Naval Intelligence Officer, speaks 7 languages. think he's one intelligent Presidential candidates we've seen long time. wish became Democratic nominee. can't life understand attitude anyone planning normal holiday gatherings year. Anyone level reading skills surely knows playing fire. information there. Sure that? gonna say Dr.Fauci works China lolol People like getting together.


shocking never suspended changed federal constitution, sorry give bad news. work way want work Lozo trying end 6 ft following GOP. Best luck.  kind wish song dance necessary. ought anything wrong government straight-up saying, ""Hey we're considering thing open public comment"" bot? forcing English garbage. American mean bothering learn languages. That's ignorant disgusting that's ""American"" means, want American anymore Native peoples almost universally pushed awarded land developed rural areas.

Nice victim blaming.  not? assholes Patriot Act. forget happened? 19 years soon? Yet, Italian race director October's Giro d'Italia furious teams positive tests removed race. exactly kind careless response leads 30k positives day. problem sovereign nation. like country mandate build infrastructure sovereign areas.

Additionally, people live farms, responsibility build well septic tank. true everywhere country. building water/septic systems every rural home fiscally reasonable Except states tax other, LOL.

Again, read! Moreover, free travel. Anecdotally, yes...it's raging since spring. mother-in-law works healthcare knows six personally died already (six healthcare workers...not six patients).

It's also killing children sure why. described awful internal estimates thousands, great sources find. best quick scan turned June clear can't track worth so, much corporation's genuinely deranged policies.

I hope find better job soon. Sure go tell president suspend federal constitution app Reddit wouldn’t help me. ??? doesnt work White House I'm sure bigger cities, Venlo skip hop away Germany, say people pro-actively engaged taking measures seriously.

People complying wearing masks shops, places business...etc. much less people city overall. Normally would big influx Germans crossing border city essentials almost none weekend. done public emergency. read fully? 

Again, New Yorkers need stop bringing bullshit rest country. thing is, without rest country, assholes would sitting ducks terrorism. One statesmen took care business, i.e., shooting Bin Laden, you. welcome. stop bringing germs idiot politicians territory. believe one first confirmed COVID-19 infections California hospitalized patient first tested positive influenza. big deal time patient hospitalized 7 days realized COVID, meant could spreading unchecked among staff week. know ever follow-up coverage patient fared whether influenza complicated infection, would interesting information. wife disagree much Minecraft creative mode acceptable. says video games rot brain, 30m max! ...I say, let dick around ""tools"" let make stuff little longer.

You can't dont exist. PRC provinces managed miracle.

Some death rates 1/10th less rest world's. Early voted last week. lost faith American politics. mismanagement virus symptom broken system. it’s published researchsquare.com? that? Privilege immunity clause ""the citizen state shall entitled privileges immunity citizens several states"" know Tony Fauci. spent part early career NIAID. trust him. much better hands listening Trump's radiologist. fact Tony survived NIAID many decades testament scientific competence, service nation, science public health manner independent politics. fact problem tells lot current administration happens narcissist worries gets better tv ratings. Well done, Slovakia! Let’s hope people tested positive quarantine, numbers go down. knew it! He's Russian plant! /s

LOL seriously thou, good look nutbag. leaderpship 

Intentional not, love this! Right ya! 4 worst hit counties, included pilot testing last weekend, lowest increase numbers country, lot. see. think China released virus intentionally may looking /r/covid19 Depends gender, age, comorbidities. you’re 65 year old obese male T2 diabetes, I’d get tested. Early intervention therapeutics might make difference outcome. healthy 25 year old? I’d less worried getting tested. first wave allow student nurses building. much liability, enough PPE. tells thirty-one people (who RSVP’d far) attendance. THIRTY ONE. 

Given spread Texas seems inevitable transmissions. grocery shopping, work, subway. Even responsible people get virus. Even could. Sad read frustrations easy understand Sounds like awesome life. really plan lift lockdown 3th November already prolonged? people going parties? get seeing friends, different risk tolerances, outright something would do. Man, hope isn’t risky like now. That’s want next year less worry, less risk. imagining things. one said this.

Speaking ""cute"".

Let link comments thread elsewhere, today without citing countless examples says 30 minutes kill virus. anything (beyond normal filtration) kill virus comes one second takes inhale. makes less likely contaminate hands touching outside mask.  would great, dozen microphones grocery store, someone triggers detection triangulate source drop net person. Well far happened twice Australia NZ. Slovak even top 100 languages spoken number. fool. Yeah unhappy marriage four years ago I’m divorced. I’m obviously thrilled that, I’m better place then. guess thank Trump normalizing divorce. /s course. It’s foolish anyone assume otherwise. Don’t trust officials tell - trust eyes see. people get virus even everything correctly. Comments like stigmatize illness ultimately make fewer people want get tested. exactly wrong America ^ take names &amp; happy vaccine way None said ever happen country. Politics never ending circle jerk matter party wins, office, always circle jerk (now people may jerk little rougher others haha) Definitely certainly needed, today 2282 cases, equal 138,000 US cases That's true, provides context additional information. trust lab conducting test good faith, else PI would put name it. indeed doesn't, never disagreement that. informing. 

And yes, case good thing lots cases, able much testing breathalyzer. Jeff Bezos owns post fuck paywall. richest person human history long overdue yeeted abyss Sure. Covid factor making decision presidential election. Maybe ugly. yet. People say comes back I’m hoping didn’t say economics 

I said freedom Right, headline unfortunate. Lockdowns good bad, really happen things already bad virus front.  It’s two weeks still can’t smell. worries little. taste fine. odd supposed linked. definitely taste cannot smell. work school district open person learning CA San Diego county. Im middle school, none schools district social distancing. due San Diego County Guidelines Reopening schools stating schools social distance “as practicable”. desks 1 ft apart, plexi-glass separate them,with 34-40 students class. high schools approximately 1300 students campus, middle school 300. stay cohort middle high school, class hour, rotate new classroom, exposing new set potential contacts class rotation. teachers 3-5 minutes clean classrooms, prep next class, use restrooms class. windows open campus. teachers told allowed teach outdoors, every class space available. mask mandate campus, kids made social distance lunch. We’ve session 2 weeks, we’ve already quarantine hundreds students district wide, actually starting see positive cases elementary schools, wasn’t happening before. middle high schools reported cases Covid within week opening. Parents quit calling absences don’t want told keep kids home 10 days, sending kids school sick, refuse get tested don’t want shut schools they’re positive. Board refuses change back virtual told going happen chose full re-opening anyways. going week 3, working all. Newsome absolute worst That’s literally comment restated said live Texas. daughter went trick treating last night, masked up, distancing time, etc. houses great: candy front sidewalk, residents sitting back greeting walked by. one house... Large crowd front... masks anyone, milling close other. noped immediately.

And that's case count exploding. scientific perspective 90% accuracy deplorable. 

But practical standpoint ... certainly beats temp checks sort standard doubt I’ll ever go back - masks essentially cured social anxiety strangers. adore anonymity especially loves fools facial tracking security cameras.

I won’t always wear N95, it’s hot sweaty worth feeling safe, cloth masks already becoming fashionable. People matching outfits them.

That said, gained complete understanding people never stopped hoarding food depression similar long term behaviors. Keeping mask purse using hand sanitizer soon get back car automatic behavior now. hoard certain items (in reasonable amounts) like toilet paper hand sanitizer never know won’t easily available. I’m far agoraphobic sure I’ll handle crowds future know nothing like used to. I’ve read suggestions make things safer, like celebrate rather wait end November - cold stay outside later month many places. Staying outside, masked, distanced short duration better going inside hours. Everyone could bring food, buffet style playing setup. they’ve got go inside, open windows. 

Getting together risky, though, different degrees depending specifics. ""And Facebook effective anti-vax tool"", continued. Indefinite isn’t necessary anyway lockdown works well. Thanks lol yeah I’m almost fine even though haven’t tried either :D Another disaster today: 16,915 cases, equal 474,000 US cases hospitals take volunteer nurses something? bring like nursing students help out? public health messaging overall comically bad Lockdown devastated economy COVID-19 devastated economy? ridiculous! cities get confined, point, virus already everywhere? Thanks! better ^^ disease definitely joke Canada's likely going supply issues. vaccine probably approved around time every country though seeing we're already rolling review like 4 vaccines. Thoughts salahs. Scum proof kids silent vectors 

Japan closed schools early mild outbreak. korea.

US schools still closed. cases growing fast fast many european countries kept schools open. lack understanding think determine kind person I'm voting problem. minimal amount conclusions make knowing I'm voting require lot ridiculous assumptions part. know I'm voting Biden, know I'm voting for, know voting still know voting person. far important factors determine kind person am. know struggled making decision, know kind options weigh determining decision. even know priorities are. even appear thinking yourself. appears succumb identity politics mindset force-fed everybody media. even considered candidate directly reflects views everything? I'm fully aware make sacrifices vote someone may counterintuitive certain ideals hold. guess easier think voting Biden means piece shit black think yourself. Definitely nationwide scale. massive operation requires lot manpower expenses. Also, actually works, necessary test entire nation track &amp; trace starts working again. believe would logical locally wherever high numbers appear continuously borders, hospitals, retirement homes etc. Thanks lot :) feeling much better first week torture mean, that's kind law is. people think they're stop people something, they're really punish people caught something. mixed results actually stopping thing. Thank you, I'll edit. absolutely point post! (or any) mask reduce probability wearer get infected. cannot provide perfect protection. believe data test report indicates effective protecting wearer around wearer disposable surgical mask. Number infections still way high today, 8683 cases, equal 168,000 US cases don’t see blame game helpful. wear masks primarily avoid spreading COVID, mask really effective prevent catching n-95. got would idea how, blaming someone household would pointless, counterproductive, likely inaccurate. think part controlled spread early, virus isn’t rampant population. safety measures places effected less virus begin with. agree excess deaths best. two drawbacks need even time first settle need classify directly-caused vs ly-caused deaths. Whether add subtract indirectly-caused deaths depends discussion having. even talking about? Comparing areas like Victoria whose outbreak months ago areas experiencing outbreaks right now?

Nope, I'm comparing peak peak. Ireland's peak per capita deaths second wave far higher Australia's peak second wave deaths. [Zoom can't even definition success according sub? Locking region months reaches zero cases?

I mean, comparing Australia, order argue Australia better ""it believes science"" bullshit like that.

You're imagining things. one said this.

I believe many European countries best can, Australian government charge countries better.

I think comparing Australia's actual results, going look bad nearly every country world. Australia dodged worst it, got small outbreaks control. Yes geographical advantages.

However, like accident well. many things vast majority countries world didn't.

It's fair, get it. Many governments best can. invited? Oh yes, protest happened Gran Vía then, liar. change genes. Got it.  FYI language called Slovak many cases even Barrington Accord nonsense impossible implement elderly would still get infected. us hate family social life. hate. Well, North high numbers South doesn't. North gets locked down. South high numbers North South would get locked down. 

The North locked due high numbers. numbers started increasing South. Therefore gone lockdown. cancel fat fucks work far pandemic brought mostly benefits. whole segment benefits this, people use computer therefore services more. introvert, socially dont mind either. dont face face meetings work more, like, work home want to, come office almost alone whole floor. Closed shops kinda annoying, wait. person could ignore news enjoy life, would quite enjoy pandemic, mainly forces everyone introvert people finally leave alone, perfectly ok alone home, work nothing. Austria announced partial lockdown tomorrow today. Anyone get it. get walking maskless people even grocery shopping. Acting like irresponsible people get COVID extremely stigmatizing people gotten infected, many cases fault own. No, did. former head neuroradiology Stanford well-known within field. forever known Trump syncophant betrayed oath political purposes. blame that. That's 150,000 cases US equivalent Several medical health professionals already stated expect administered January United States better 14 European countries, Italy Legit concern. Ppl won’t even stop Halloween let alone thksgvg Christmas nye. 

I’m thinking splitting smaller meetings, ask get tested/be certain test negative, flu shots, maybe outdoor gathering park backyard bbq. students living campus? So, ends whole, ""but masks everybody else's protection!"" circlejerk. Everybody wants wear masks wear these, everybody else go back enjoying going public No, destination demand quarantine. enforcement, follow etc company's site: layer beneath CAZ nanomembrane filter tight pores block virus, equivalent N80 rating. 

N80 means filters least 80% airborne particles. equivalent hobbyist respirator (e.g. like know data supporting claim N80 rating though. question is
Will affect us long run?
I mean true Vaccine? Although it’s encouraging, data far complete. 

Let’s complete data. Schools studied extensively opinion. inside schools, entire process. Parents picking dropping kids congregating, school activities sports, kids removing masks walking home hanging friends, transportation from, etc etc.

There’s lot potential community spread outside official school hours wish could studied could clearer picture pros cons person learning... it, interested. I've heard positive things, long waits! tried since pretty much hermit right now, I'll definitely utilise need to! exercise get exercising rights bear arms, free speech, slammin’ brisket.  What's prediction upcoming winter America? El Paso. Even stuff see shows like Live PD fake. family get caught weed show took jail. told beforehand going happen let go fine afterwards. that’s usually case funny since marijuana laws started here. Asian countries followed rules lenient. also contained virus much faster larger cities brilliant track trace.

It took Singapore 3 months completely lifted circuit breaker, took China 5 months lifted restrctions still ""wipe covid."" Why? ultimately necessary goal. Life back ""normal"" livable. UK get decent track-and-trace system? seen good answer truly don’t get people like can’t see, could completely wipe covid spent 2 months inside following rules.

Those two different states. two month lockdown like one rules after? Rules like Singapore has? Rules like South Korea? Again, Britain relax ""rules"" without good contact tracing system place knew needed? can't see know simple, plus reality. need making impractical goals---just one month we'll back normal!---is EU state want fight rules, making drag yes that, believe not, rules get TIGHTER. go longer!

I'm fighting rules they're illogical dysfunctional designed deal COVID efficiently. situation fear case Singapore, case South Korea, case Japan, case Taiwan, case Vietnam, case China. Guess what? places except Vietnam Taiwan still COVID cases end world. also, places strict restrictions borders people country continue live relative ease.

What UK needs (and need read thoroughly explain workable UK)

1. SPH orders cases 5% positivity rate nationwide, take 2 months, little-to-no household mixing exceptions made caregivers single people (Neil Ferguson situations acceptable, Dominic Cummings situations not), people cannot travel outside city/provincial limits even previously listed exceptions. contact tracing system needs put place time, well boosting testing capacity PPE pipeline. government must offer financial compensation civilians businesses lockdown. Fines given rulebreakers. Lockdown must lifted cases managed tracing testing system, extensions allowed positivity rate reached. Stopping outbreaks without lockdowns government's focus, well keeping positivity rate low trough mass testing.

2. lockdown, gradual reopening businesses (hair salons, eateries, shopping malls) outdoor areas (parks, zoos, beaches). Capacity limits mask mandates open businesses outdoor areas. People allowed shop clothes similar items. 2-3 households allowed mix indoors without masks, unless household contains high risk people, mixing must masked; public gatherings 5 households, participants must masked. Mask mandates physical distancing rules place public spaces. would continue 2 months. outbreaks occur handled mass testing isolation patients. Businesses small outbreaks shut temporarily cleaning. Short, local lockdowns necessary large amount outbreaks cannot traced source.

3. cases continue well managed, household mixing allowed masked unmasked situations. Intrastate borders lift restrictions capacity limits businesses increased mask mandates must place outdoor businesses given preference indoor ones. Mask mandates eased outdoor spaces like parks beaches capacity limits kept. Fines must still given people skirting breaking rules. stage designed last longest, least 3-4 months. relaxation rules slight functional vaccine starts distributed. state, travel restrictions lifted countries also low cases, orders must closed otherwise except imports business travelers certain countries must quarantined. 

See, long-term, workable plan reliant ""wiping out"" COVID. utilizes one effective lockdown allows gradual complete relaxation vaccine distributed. short-term action get UK back pre-COVID normal, even everyone followed rules. great thing need go back ""normal"" make somewhat livable vaccine out. plan would usable EU nations see reason why, outside border closures, UK could execute solutions. know literature perceived norms create social pressure behavior change. Yes, lit review find examples laws public health messaging backfiring, examples people shifting towards adherence. also think presenting binary sort argument people really spectrum responses policies even though always people respect follow them, people shift behavior, even slightly, overall positive impact. said received phone call one Johnson's advisors lots questions operation. might sound silly, someone wants teacher would make really sad never got see full faces kids teach. Critical thinking seen attacking religion. That's problem. strong fear US Christianity critical thinking science education. Croatia 4 million population, really high per capita. Even India talks frontline workers getting vaccinated mid December cliché said France, probably holds truth, Germans better respected rules. Seen average less people, kept distance, etc. perhaps lax rules, easier follow long run everybody.

My similar question is: things bad Belgium? quality problems live suburbs Chicago. amount people think strictly small town Illinois problem also staggering. seen great mask compliance stores gone to, also observed ton parties drove around last night. People convinced impact them, leading spreading close contacts. south west despite lowest case numbers, predicted hit hospital capacity counties approx 2 weeks. artefact way NHS structured means actually one worrying regions. used liber tarian turn anarcho-capit alist. 

I research sides realized misinformation. Hopefully u/customerny comes around one day  confirm-state governments started drawing protocols doctors,frontline workers final year medical students well Yeah, constantly saying great encouraging kind compliance even slightest adjustments behavior. ""But kids spread virus, even get sick."" LAMP test completely different test. That's alternative RT-PCR test. cheaper faster RT-PCR. accurate RT-PCR. highly dought takes 60 seconds. need bring lab first, multiple stages needed test material, can't done 60 seconds I'd assume. source 60 second LAMP test would love read it.

But LAMP test nothing breathalyzer test. Central Utah here. Drove around Friday night restaurants PACKED, masks find data cases percentage actual tests administered?  

People keep saying US control, terms large population, really seem like daily cases. titled post “coronavirus mixture solar radiation hidden tick borne illness”. statement supported articles posted. much value treating better people catch people die overall hospitals still get overwhelmed disagree. Lockdown masks helped nobody expected completely flip cases deaths almost nothing like did. flatten curve eliminate it. firmly believe season caused go severely.

Look, northeast time conditions right sure avenues spread. Compliance fantastic everyone says. Uh huh. approach seems going well. /s

For millions across planet, way ends gasping.  glad moved there. people know California opted trick treating together year. definitely tough choice make though. worries, upvoted honesty 👍 said 3 people initially misdiagnosed coronavirus


Yes? ... terrible forensics. definitely treating better also much worse job containing case numbers getting control. doesn’t matter deathrate lowers 1/2 4x cases necessarily true. lot people test negative even everyone household test positive-one ""mysteries"" virus will.

Having said yes isolate. kind like national debt, except virus scared nukes call debt start repo-ing shit, right? Dr. Fauci choice neither Dr. Birx. Trump used credibility standing next team totally disregarded advice day one. call stuff appearance de facto endorsement due recent association.

Dr. Fauci credibility credentials anyone prominence US media right now. Atlas quack hire relevant credentials, almost nobody heard recently. Sounds like joke somewhere  told sport, I'm disparaging let stuff like get down. last one even little bit better, keep - everyone loves tryer! Redditors say that, interesting think why. makes young American kids self loathing? actually kinda cute. people may starve least contract virus. Op know commas exist? Czech thing now. Especially nothing actual post Slovakia. basically posted “yeah Czechs dying lot.” didn’t really anything else say. no, aren’t really making point. TL;DR news article DETECT study, launched March 25, uses mobile app collect smartwatch activity tracker data consenting participants, also gathers self-reported symptoms diagnostic test results. adult living United States eligible participate study downloading research app, study published October 29 Nature Medicine, Scripps Research team reports wearable devices like Fitbit capable identifying cases COVID-19 evaluating changes heart rate, sleep activity levels, along self-reported symptom data—and identify cases greater success looking symptoms alone. I'm fucking pissed right this.

My wife doctor stood outside talking Trump loving neighbors 15+ minutes. wore mask stood less 6ft apart walk away. neighbors already kid infected recovered full ""let's get get it"" mode.

I'm sitting thinking threw away months work can't walk away neighbors. First study linked shows Lyme disease misdiagnosed COVID, look effects different stages lyme disease vs covid symptoms.

N=3. millions people secretly didn’t COVID symptoms similar COVID that’s bigger issue right now. That’s article says. said 3 people initially misdiagnosed coronavirus instead tick borne infection treated timely manner.  RN, yeah, important nurses get paid instead expected volunteer here. Hospitals afford hire nursing staff; unfortunately, choose administrators want line pockets. state still comprehensive “stages” type plan? I’m Wisconsin thrown window months ago. feels like everything devolved guesswork pretty much everywhere.

I agree I’m way interested “COVID normal” - so, I’ve already doing? No, he's neither crook, cook.

He's speaking outside specialty, though, general consensus scientific community appears wrong. guarantee majority people educated field always going right questioned knowledge, there's expectation. say 'A', says 'B', compelling case earn trust support.

Whether right, not, lack clear consistent messaging government results reduced trust government. would assume people would listen *anyone* government right now? look like they've got slightest clue manage *anything*? I'm convinced could manage third shift Taco Bell. much better would economy let virus run rampant?

Find county anywhere world that's well without lockdown. Nope, president Idiocracy listened people knew did. worse Idiocracy! 99.7% survive COVID, percentage think likely long term symptoms?

You realize reason news site interviews rare therefore newsworthy, right? talking Australia. Well, I’ve never seen plants grow toilet. I'm sorry. Welcome America Fucking idiocy. 😂😂😂 30 letter (6 actually used language, used borrowed words, names). really letters said differently depending contex. usually kids learn sounds standard length ever letter causing problems, pretty much clicks.  I'm pointing US government lift finger help states get testing going I've read Reddit story, trust media. Lost friend week. It’s coming admit wealthy I've looking forward burning mine. Real question, people without vehicles supposed regards testing? I’m sick, get sick, supposed do? Get roommate drive potentially infect her? Take public transport potentially infect everyone bus? Walk? drive testing nice there’s huge amount people don’t access car. doesn’t seem good option people limited transport options. Guy / gal / non-binary pal Gotta hit frying pan. worked Country Steve.

The bad news: school district stuck 6.9% since summer.  

The good news: We're one less 10 states infection rates pivoting upward right now.   ""you know history!""

It's funny context Hey trouble, taking I'm fucking tired sub.

- you, 8 hours ago

And yet... Yea lower percentage death means virus wearing treating better . There’s fair amount trolling here, everyone disagree troll  wrong Spain celebrate day dead. Stop racist educate yourself.

Edit: ""Better known El Dia de los Muertos (Day Dead Souls Day), Halloween Spain three-day celebration kicks October 31st Dia de las Brujas (Day Witches), continues Dia de Todos los Santos (All Saints Day) November 1st, culminates Dia de los Muertos (Day Dead) November 2nd""

MADRID (Reuters) - Spanish families normally honour dead relatives visiting cemeteries Day Dead spacing visits year second wave coronavirus sweeps country.

Authorities advised families spend 30 minutes graveyards go large groups mark event, linked Catholic holidays Saints’ Day Souls’ Day start November.

“Our family coming separately, two three days apart. last visit,” said Francisco Gonzalez, 81, visited Almudena cemetery Madrid wife.

Spain imposed six-month state emergency last week enabling impose measures aimed trying reduce soaring rate coronavirus infections, including night curfews. 9 months in, I’m expecting compliance. personally skip parties, expecting people follow rules point simply wishful thinking. Liberian flag. Dr. Birx  Like hate her, beginning August clearly stated next phase would different.  stated virus everywhere, urban rural, warned complacency areas point spared. warned Covid ubiquitous things going get bad critiqued certain leader became way less public. Everything said currently happening. im sure close vaccine are, info floating around. vaccine pop probably half assed like let say 50% success rate.

“ technically “ vaccine rushed half bake dont even know might happen.

Best thing wait scientists say something public figures, county, mayors, etc. scientists first hand conducting testing not

you dont want repeat 1976 swine flu vaccine deaths
- aka rammed vaccine throuhh went oj shit know vaccines causing this. worry, shitshow here, too. case, changing stuff time almost chaotically, people local governments (who actually organize much event, national government), get many important informations updating them. lead national testing shitshow. way announce measures shitshow. Thr way communicate shitshow. surprise PM went terrible shift approval rates many people voted movement resent him. way talks journalists, way talks scientists disagree way, disgusting. That's person want lead nation global crisis, one thing went well. general populism, well fact provably plagiarised diploma thesis verbally attacked journalists informing help.

So yeah, we're going shitshow, too. things well, things badly. hospitals brink collapse even recent measures already place might end late weeks. We're success story yet. Jeez shitty.

The fact matter worldwide problem single country population government.

I'm glad New Zealand Taiwan Australia done great job yet seen reoccur places.

I hope anyone going shut world one goes longer periods time rest us mess? Yes none case count France lot European countries have. Contract tracing works manageable case loads, that's case Europe. mean Illinois cases california texas pretty crazy Look downvotes. People starting see shit. least victim group vaping completely different covid. Also loss smell. Maybe destroyed lung similar destroyed lung.  curfews protests/riots summer lifted without violence. measures place enforce this. accord friend works hotel says people coming complaining wearing masks, even wearing all. one says anything airport either pr 2) national guard made doctors nurses already working doctors nurses civilian hospitals

The military doctors nurses already acting doctors nurses military hospitals. 

Just remark hospitals don’t sit 20% capacity, holds true military medicine.

Edited add: no. nearly enough PPE use designed. mostly true, none vaccine candidates (at least U.S) sounds like going accept 50% threshold, even minimum requirement FDA standards.

Moderna Pfizer two leading candidates right expected efficacy somewhere 74-80%, Johnson &amp; Johnson one-shot candidate provided number yet they're bit behind others, also said anticipated ""significantly 50%."" I'd say anything that's 70% considered ""high"" generally speaking enough worry much safety anymore. Even come contact virus threshold, 70-80% high enough prevent noticeable symptoms, chance penetrate immune system, able fight something resembles cold sniffles.

Otherwise I'm sure say people line totally refuse take even widely available. I'm trying sound cold ways feel like Darwinian point. People can't put lives hold forever Karens midwest think they're microchipped. I'm worried live (NYC) we're pro-science city people lining take everything we've though....but definitely see states struggling navigate problem within next 8 months. Governors privately owned businesses may facing tough decisions whether they'll need initiate immunity certificate requirements people return work, school, travel, etc. controversial never done before, also *not* unconstitutional *are* living unprecedented times. cares?! Get thing tested, give everyone can. not. staffed military personnel. 

We large military. draw world medical personnel work branches military. field medics basically good doctors.

You mistaken. worry, Italy overtake France week so. (/s) Vietnam 30 million people France. Japan twice size France denser. SK 10m less. Yeah, that's really good 2nd number report well. Who?

Well, Europe, US, parts South America. I'm well aware talking post covers already.

I'm aggressive answer obvious yet even explaining brain completely ignored it. Texas. continue see numbers rise. take precautions... masks, social distancing, etc. It’s several months since pandemic, numbers continue rise, yet don’t know single person directly virus. one work, family, friends. Makes think statistics sometimes. local news websites absolute garbage? I'd love watch phone video disappeared behind mass click bait ads Kardashian butt sweat vaccines Britain Canada started rolling reviews current leading candidates, small real chance get approval next 2-3 weeks. FDA US accept rolling reviews would take longer approval.  Meh, worried. Try shut things people go back homes. Kind late that. implemented 100 years ago, World War 1 happened. don’t manpower stand hospital ships field hospitals across country.

Those field hospitals hospital ships stealing labor lightly hit areas. won’t lightly hit areas sufficient quantities shuffle let carry on. JFC, people anything avoid science, eh? someone kept record everyone deserted fight sars2, deserters could allowed wait treatment everything done save actually fought. back normal basically since June melbourne hard lockdown. State borders closed sure shops, restaurants open people still working home gone back office too. kind hard believe what's happening overseas normal one fixating. one even remotely cared threw hissy fit. People don’t want live behind computer screen whole year life virus 99% survival rate Maybe. However, many articles I've read suggest follow-up vaccination likely necessary. Covid-19 vaccines may need reformulated regular basis depending strains circulating. Also, length immunity could limited necessitating frequent boosters. Maybe vaccination good 6 months 10 years plus. one really knows. Hopefully, latter. Actually, Europe distinction right now. Oh thank god city fine! really scared second there, 20,000 cities must okay hospitals good nothing it. one knew deal this. throwing darts wall. Darts every hospital country access to. 

It localized also bit true. bigger event cities hit hardest nature living city. even spelled image linked. USA increased testing ? mediocre start see unresponsible americans are, Wonder numbers bigger.   sure got downvoted. even 500$ lot normal person like post defend other's rights kill? Good know. Well November. four months go.

Hope $3 beers Sturgis worth it. Eh, really scandal. typical level despair Robert Fico.

I kinda chuckled Minister FA indirectly called wannabe consitutional lawyer response published today. Lol matter time close again. virus isnt gone. Lockdowns lower number cases temporarily, theyre ultimate solution say April localized disaster luckily happened localized cities best hospitals world.  There’s going parts wave easier April, there’s going parts much difficult. enjoy getting sick, that’s choosing,

As long get anyone else sick, fucking care. 50 &amp; fit fuck. personally fear damned scourge. thisisfine.jpg Unfortunately natural get huge number deserters civilian population, nobody training deal this. 

If me, would give really small fine anyone breaks mitigation regulations write deserters. broke mitigation regulations second time, would charge desertion. really not. Viruses general mutate faster large multi-cellular organism like us long duration time generations. acting like typical virus terms mutation. problematic antigenic drift found hemagglutinin influenza viruses unique characteristic influenza viruses specifically. definitely plan wear them. People Asia don’t wear prevent sickness. also help you’re area lot air pollution allergens.

I feel like mask-wearing helped spring seasonal allergies year. didn’t take Claritin like normally inhaling less pollen.

I remember walking around major city South East Asia couple years ago lots smog. come region US good air quality totally unprepared would make feel. shocking congested got could feel chest. knowledge mask-wearing time, going forward I’ll definitely wear urban areas lot car traffic.

I see masks useful Americans living areas affected wildfire smoke well. Americans. Last looked world fire. Let's keep honest. couple players sit entire year cardiac complications. 

One college player died. 

These exceedingly rare cases though No, way safely. needs data support open. needs actual enforcement penalties following regulations. needs support programs businesses closed. all, needs public support safety precautions. don’t solutions tell current / prior plan began fail right start phase 2 / none things. Ok   shows can't fix economy pandemic control high percentage people simply certain things even open. 

A significant percentage people traveling eating restaurants even though open. Yes course people - despite risks. People know takeout delivery amount outdoor dining. That's enough restaurants survive - especially cold weather arriving.

And Disney (at least read) attempting run parks safely possible means even maximum attendance still much lower pre-pandemic since operating fraction capacity. again, think many people traveling Florida Disney - safety reasons lot money effort not-so-great experience. Heart breaking brought dad doctor says would unethical much like still give medical care drug alcohol addicts even though refuse stop using, counter addiction general consensus medical model disease social model. Whereas antimask people selfish, never heard selfishness considered disorder. respect it. know mean people still using word “retarded” 2020? Exponential growth go long. many people get virus staggering amount people already gotten it. Statistically speaking aren’t much danger getting ones died definitely won’t get again. 

80% people get COVID present 0 symptoms. know this. 

Of 20% maybe 5% need medical attention. Less? haven’t seen numbers that. know maybe could help out. 

1-10 people globally contracted virus according WHO. assuming plays US 32.5 Million people passed away. like ~290million people left catch virus. think going get next month? 

It would helpful know percentage people need hospitalization though.

Edit: NYC 585 new cases 10 new hospitalizations. That’s 1.7% cases needing hospitalization. got citizen app probably accurate sake conversation let’s give margin error +/- 2%?

Not crazy. Majority pick option 2 shit hit fan, come back blame gov demand/protest gov removed replaced Well yes no. also gotta remember little infections summer. spread going happen, whether june july august would shut not. 1k confirmed per day August. Even lower, would still looking similiar situation now.  Speaking introvert social anxiety, 31 way easier than, say, 5. Much less conversational weight shoulders disappear 15 min recharge without anyone noticing, keep busy tasks chores find without conversation group. Check nice moments people maybe one two longer conversations everyone left good impression without lot strain me. Christmas never realistic end date. like ""two weeks"". could make good headline. Well seem favor position ""their"" mean WH; even opposed generally. 

I mean ethereal hard define, serious probably includes lot people blowing wearing mask keeping encounters brief infrequent way truth""

I mean experts politicians think we're going mask distance even available vaccine, expected 2022, say otherwise people comply can't handle reality. people handle reality handicapped can't. go incremental keep extending every weeks people use 'moved goalposts' excuse comply call future requirements question. better honest.  Coronavirus' mutate like influenza does. Corona mutate, general mutations really change much immunity kind like measles chicken pox, influenza lot different common mutations change immune system identifies virus. put simpler terms, coronaviruses might change personalities attitudes, still identifiable influenza changes name gets new passport face every year enjoy getting sick, that’s choosing, Yes, federal government *really* continue financial support. Don’t allow “economists” convince opening early good economy; getting things control damaging couple extra weeks precautionary lockdown.

Economists saying this, thankfully. Economists saying control virus!

Idiots saying reopen business. looks like right either Pfizer Oxford/Astrazeneca sounds like school cut March year, ""oh y'know might week off, extended spring break...."" Anyways, wishing luck backwoods New York agree this.

Regardless much money company has, really hard keep tens thousands payroll return. need government assistance keep businesses afloat new congress January Sometimes it’s hard executives make boats meet. know good Yacht payments dockage fees. They’ve lost plenty US visitors too

It actually seems like they’ve done good job making relatively safe experience, would never fly family fucking Florida right Canadian here. bunch fucking assholes. Always important remember stupid people everywhere.  Belgium fewer people NRW (11M vs 18M). lower population density (380/km2 vs 530/km3). yet far COVID deaths (11.6K vs 2.2K).

You excuses lined up? Mental health. You’re mental. media Murdoch owned trying destroy start., wife caught never did. She’s ER nurse she’s coming contact covid pretty much daily. We’ve sleeping different beds using different bathrooms. seems enough. 

Funny part work basically follows cdc guidelines quarantining, really really needed found positive, told go get test. test came back negative gave paperwork go work. Uh.

Vermont controls people enter Vermont. New York controls people enter New York. Vermont could create requirement New Yorkers.

Vermont also controls people flout rules. New York same.

I... get it.  cant impose fines cooperating contact tracers since “voluntary” unless comes federal govt since state judges saying yes federal judges saying no. HB isn’t beach know. It’s norm wear masks you’re Slowly walking backwards... North felt ironic someone doesnt believe coronavirus big deal posting another state's numbers thought better try summarize make reference two countries without revealing ones title ending ""here's why"". guy charge continues host mostly maskless events..  is. be. Even though Toon CEO name....🤪 OK guys, false alarm! Savannah fine! 👌.   
Whew, scared second there...   
/s explanation. Europe lot (masks, movement restrictions etc) yet lot cases huge spike two countries. Insane... cases Wisconsin 3.7% last week Sunday's numbers in, hopefully Dakotas start improve soon  We're #1!?!?!?!  actually enforceable Hawaii since fly in. ""MTGA"" So, saying Churchill would better told everyone irrationally believe end air raids matter weeks away? Probably, also fall allergy season lots people excess mucous right LOL feel better writing this?  Even tiny deficit performance would make noticeable difference athletes level sport.

It's encouraging athletes tested positive virus, none (as far I've seen) seen lasting impact. are, they're tiny minority. evidence favour idea long-term effects healthy people likely rare. really hard post article without changing title? That’s true, someone kind middle spectrum, it’s hard believe lot people perfectly okay social interaction. Limited? Sure. basically none all? think that’s pretty small number. take much dampness breathing render mask ineffective, 20 minutes; even notice dampness required disable it. plenty moisture comes every breath, notice - would notice tiny virions passing mask like fly chain link fence. 

here's relevant article original sars scare back point even one example history people “set aside freedom” got back without violence? fda dragging it’s feet You’d find urgent care/doctor’s office/lab site walk test location locality. Getting challenge though reasons stated. Try expose least amount people possible getting there. You’re right nowhere near options need walk depending people live. you’re sick walk that’s another issue. cities metro vans come test that’s thought! think said anything specific numbers, however expects transmission get much worse cold driving people indoors, gatherings indoors increasing holidays, pandemic fatigue anger. CEO company. Dude, begged parents last night go surging everywhere here, - - care. 

Never thought I'd see apathy selfishness them. Confuses too, things, y'all willing die go **restaurant**? *Seriously*?

Nobody cares... covid cause excess mucous? half police officers died something happened duty died Covid-19 caught truly supported police would least ask people wear masks public, socially distance, help beat Covid-19. Yes, society pile shit. doctor sort like parent - take responsibility kid even they're acting like spawn Satan. everybody turns alerts benefits outweigh risks vulnerable population.

The whole point testing determine whether true not. doesn’t really explain why. Also cases growing Europe UK.   That’s true extroverts, it’s necessarily true introverts. me, sheltering place adjustment huge one, stay home time anyway don’t need lot social interaction. want interact certain person, phone call suffice. agree, least need move direction. think happen least vaccine comes out, people finally see helping nearly much quickly expected (even though they've already told silver bullet many many times.) Big tech could show leadership tracing program (oh pay taxes) MIA, busy playing politics. meantime healthcare infrastructure going severely damaged coming months. Thanks clarity Thanks, forgotten name appreciate mentioning it. intensive group therapy last November little EMDR really like intro guess? bit everything wanted get that. month talked therapists after, better, told med boarding him, people PTSD diagnoses known win challenges board. tell people get help punish it? Shitty.


 Hoping VA better therapists combat veterans.

But never getting good night sleep rough him, dedicated PTSD treatment like EMDR would better generic anti depression meds they've thrown him. Really appreciate mentioning it, I'll bring subject. Thanks again. Actually see can't done larger scale, 1 testing place 1000 people, 1 nurse doctor (local), 1-2 policemen (local), 1 soldier, couple volunteers (local). thing done state level logistics get PPE tests towns. 

Biggest problem doctors nurses (we neighbouring countries. western countries higher rate doctors/1000 people.  Yup. can't stand seeing maps show total cases per country, point population map. Like course France Germany total cases, gave highest populations E.U. countries. People downvote things like, even things true. virus care people choosing live denial. make easier spread, probably will. here. It's...I can't even think word anymore. Feel like person around want catch it/thinks real. Anyone local FB pages states concerned/thinks wear masks gets absolutely ripped shreds. Fat people continue eat garbage? Refuse treatment!

Diabetics compliant treatment? 
Refuse treatment!

This fun. sadly, Tuesday four years... Media going told stop reporting COVID, economy remain propped middle upper class weather storm, civil unrest going absolutely erupt.

Be prepared, COVID quick lesson prep. 2021 going make 2020 look like vacation year... Alright, calm down. love username OP! people aren’t responsible mess right thing 2016. live New York, also work healthcare. takes couple days get appointment couple days get result want free test provided hospital local health department. pay testing fee (or me, copay), test demand urgent care results day two. 

I’m sorry situation, many others, difficult. Nothing specific tbh general pattern we've seen UK. Open schools/uni, gradually open indoor restaurants/pubs, allow small groups mixing home. Everything seems OK months gradually cases tick know exponential growth. deaths seem low first sure enough start rise.

I say someone desperately wanted us able 'live virus' cope measures still able travel. mean - that's technically possible - able stomach high deaths basically build temporary morgues let bodies pile up. Turns lot people UK _thought_ supported policy, turns see through.

So either continue perma lockdown-and-release cycle switch tack Aus/NZ model doubt it. oxford / astrazeneca halloween don’t think really get it. Many West happily trade lives lost due COVID avoid totalitarianism like China did. Yes is. grocery stores packed today everyone talking Steeler game parties tonight. might quarantine family bit working polls Tuesday. don’t think we’ll go back lockdown like March/April. don’t think it’s going enforceable. ultimately people used something take thing away they're gonna upset it

doesn't help live world people forced compete fewer fewer jobs climate change bears us handful rich ghouls enrich beyond belief expense. consumption escape reality long can't that. 

sometimes people want sit home night confront fact life actually pretty shit, want go game bar blame em one bit aware pipe dream, venting, plain simple. 

It absolutely sucks healthcare professionals killing save worthless lives happily defy research medical science taught us controlling virus. OP nutjob No, not. know, masks general protect around people you, thick, thus people care everyone else wear mask enforced authority. sound like idiot, may partially right.  Oh, look you, powerful strong edgelord. Australia, New Zealand Probably better point Victoria, Australia. China foreign many.

In July, Vic tied France. Vic's pulling 0s seemingly every day.

They never half assed lockdown though, clear cases slowing sufficiently, curfew combined 5km distance house, combined lockdown. Borders course closed countries virus there's vaccine.

But know what? worked. whole Australia pulled zero local cases yesterday, thanks efforts. Summer looking up. winter people about. 

Furthermore, countries winter already started, people kept wearing masks (like new Zealand) winter related illnesses like flu dropped significantly. 

So hope see encouraging results. might say something California dealing spread. Maybe me, people taking seriously begin with. parents refused stop going restaurants public places almost daily ever since started. I'm actually kinda amazed gotten yet, though probably asymptomatically. Which, that's case, even infuriating they're willing going around spreading without giving damn anyone themselves. 

People goddamn selfish, man. understand discussion measures. core competence judge ones right ones

Wow, doctor went life-threatening covid infection deal severe cases daily basis shows much restraint regarding issue.

I'm usually calm person, whenever see someone TV complaining shutdown restaurants bars, I'm quite close yelling TV like crazyman.  oxford vax? addicted convenience worst attribute could COVID age. Americans westerners find unbearable wear strip fabric face they’re used always getting exactly want. likely spreading smaller get togethers people less cautious.  school making us remove masks learn makeup application :( People say every thread, violation medical ethics. give patients preferential treatment, job judge.  people miners farmers, wtf talking about. interact customers. Influenza also cause heart damage. there's 10 million confirmed Covid cases, probably times actual cases, mostly anecdotal evidence 'long-term' issues. top comment? People developing world live different conditions. populations much younger fatality rates coronavirus much lower result. Furthermore, food insecurity much higher. Instituting policies surrounding covid developing developed nations terrible idea. reliable tests hubs work home...other lack indoor social things kids, life same. Wish what? Key phrase response:

Real scary pandemic.

If danger real support extreme measures. isn’t real scary pandemic wtf doing??? No, meant people perpetuating doom narrative often act condescending ""naive"" hopeful people. none went crazy like China early on. Shit South Korea never even shut down. Yes, is. Northern half Illinois. travelling South state, (albeit immature) joke yet, we're Effing-ham. Illinois feel long boring. going much. virus 14 day incubation period. easily get infected day two still test negative catch virus traveling spread 5-7 days later. 3 day quarantine long enough. Idk aviable live Dräger X-plore 3300 good packages too. check get one right filter class. Fits really good price highest filter class 35€ back then, actual think 40-45€ mask+filter. much difference think quality say 3m looks badass compared dräger imo.  Scotland readying country wide vaccinations december would ever wear mask getting vaccinated? would ever that? That’s cool know consequences. hospitals hopelessly overrun society crumble mild degree. Countless unavoidable miserable death need happen. long term Italy become 3rd world 1st world well. that’s price need pay it. Wow. Open eyes friend. western propaganda really tainted perspective rest world. We're living 1950's anymore. world evolved. making sound uninformed ignorant. France entered lockdown Friday think we'll wait abit start see whether covid slowing there. lockdown immediately cause covid cases fall lot people assume walk ICU, it'll loud hustle bustle,"" Alozie said. ""But nurses physicians teams going used ICU,"" continued. ""But many patients ICU, paralyzed prone, truly knowing there's large number course time going added human tragedy count really unsettling."" far know lockdowns Australia lifted last week.

Now big news thing zero cases.

Personally think country going hold accomplishment length time. Well, deleted comment writting is. South Dakota population 880k. USA 328 million. 12 deaths South Dakota day. 12/880 000= 4472/ 328 000 000 rabies (100% fatality rate) mutates new strain that's transmissible via aerosol, people spread virus 20-60 days showing symptoms do, they're already sentenced painful death.

God save us. Today governor announced ""rule out"" second lockdown. Stupid vague; issued one spot. there's one body blame other, government enforcing anything, trying regulate airlines pretty much all. airlines simply follow capitalistic free market government supports.

Airlines countries (not countries, some) reigned governments told do. Source: Work ground handling company Australia. flight levels dropped 400/week we've last 6 months, 20/week, handle international. That's Melbourne international airport, Australia's second largest airport.

Obviously company handle every single flight Australia, companies similar fashion. national carrier budget line (Qantas &amp; Jetstar) trying let go workforce can't afford it, national carrier (Virgin &amp; Tiger) announced they're going administration looking buyers.

Bailouts provided, airlines operate limited flights states, even limited country. know like US, March 26th shut pretty much every international flight except carried Aussie citizens back foreign citizens here. 

Tl;dr blame government regulating airlines. see way make little bit money they're going take it, they're capitalist companies government basically telling they're fine. government proactive, reactive. Enact masks stop Covid getting control, already control.

Airlines companies dedicated making money. government make behave safely. They're going operate whatever capacity they're allowed to. They're terrible companies, 100% agree, countries problems airlines. There’s nothing says cops even enforce law. fact law says enforce law (castle rock v Gonzales 2005).

Cops get choose enforce every day, huge part problem. orders like also systemic issues US policing today. Interesting note, however, get many chances, finally came close contact girlfriend.

Anecdotal, sure, I've yet heard call close gyms place bars restaurants, gyms targeted hotspots transmission. 16 beds based available data. Considering positivity rate hospitalization rate skyrocketed, almost certainly full triage mode point, especially considering they've setup field counties facing similar problems. Amarillo 13 beds, Dallas county rapidly taking beds. Almost every day Dallas county we've gotten ICU patients. Recently 70+ ICU beds taken up, going 270 160.

Triage also happens well ahead number 0, certain number beds already begin deciding gets bed; zero that's decisions made turn away. hunch millions, doubt someone knows figure out. Good thing science based anecdotal evidence ""hand egg"" real ""foot"" ball

But game Feet touch ball fake one? lol

Picture understand better :) needs reduce amount people die, harmful is, get fatality rate flu levels, go back normal life, bonus points reduces spread. well happened april Prince William seems dead(he 37) im mistaken think schools kept open UK, France, Germany Ireland entering lockdown. Problem can't really afford keep kids school could potentially cause harm longer miss education combat triage, quite quickly start dropping params stay within resources available. let's hope stay 80+, old people diabetes, immunocompromised etc, never lower params way may affect someone love. Yeah fucking wish Australia, hugely impressive they've done VA. dont think replicate Canada though our, ahem, somewhat science sceptical neighbours. Watching Bledisloe last weeks fans im locations class, shown ""real"" sport still going somewhere world. Hopefully get back Super10 least rugby wise. 

All Canada really keep ""manageable"" levels, cannot fully shut border way Australia able. Well maybe could, people seem stomach turmoil would happen. (The Ambassador Bridge detroit - Windsor world's busiest border crossing terms $$$ value goods crossing daily). fully believe woulda got double digit cases Canada summer border. See exactly won’t prove bc can’t fraud lol take action required 
To make action stick/noone get bored make political 'muh freedoms' That’s like people making distinction furloughed laid off. still sucks happens you. limited number ~~beds~~ nurses.

This even bigger factor currently. trust police enforce fairly? cops America already apart Covid fake masks Communist crowd. Many never wear walk stores wearing course retail workers can't say anything. Yeah even mask, 5-6 days week gym (or enclosed space) still high risk. Anyways hope ok. I'm reading novel. I'm sorry hear dumb. smart. isnt wizard casting spells detecting coronavirus cases. tests. tests available even free cost. 4+ months ago unless hospital getting tested unavailable confirming cases thus new cases could reported. Please assume dont take virus seriously dont take precautions. take test every single week protect people around me. I'm also moron understand numbers going detected more. I'm arguing anymore argument first place. objectively true even Fauci agree it. Look long took certify rapid tests depopulation plan would wiping us much quicker bloody virus. Draconian lockdowns = great job?

From I’ve heard, Australians aren’t well lockdowns. I’ve heard anecdotal, Aussie friends family tell families really struggling can’t go anywhere, even grocery store. Las Crucens go el Paso. Mandatory quarantine everyone tested. correct response ""Sorry completely misread that"" ""Sorry responded wrong comment"". “Right leaning”.

NYC completely left state/ city already gone one outbreak it’s way towards second. know it’s right’s fault. I'm Michigan, praying another lockdown. medical grade something like KN95/KF94/N95 degree source control, also primary purpose protect. got downvoted shit suggesting New York trajectory - OK maybe slower - pattern undeniable. 

As resident NYC, looking Italy right making *very* pessimistic next months. :/ find amazing US found someone blame here, pulled *another* multinational accord middle crisis group trying help us from. Melbourne made huge sacrifice months. rest country really appreciates it. Hopefully back normal soon math. buy it. confirm thing everyone forgets covid. I've heard many people telling things much better longer get 2,500 deaths day. Like sure deaths alot lower hospitalisations rising. matter covid deaths lower hospitals start run beds. cause covid deaths also deaths non covid illnesses  Nah, look X upper right advert check Social dilemma Netflix. keep pushing towards it! source? child like yourself? thanks.  Countries mentioned replies comments shown maintaining rights liberties compatible properly managing pandemic. Rather falling totalitarian policies Chinese regime thus improving image, ask manage pandemic liberal form government like South Korea New Zealand have. vaccines prevent mild cases likely prevent severe cases don’t know you’re talking reg chalking early case severity malingering (or anything else covid) preposterous disingenuous. 

It tells there’s lot don’t know disease, perhaps intentionally. Definitely worth engaging bad-faith discussion. Lmao Bit harsh call us shitshow worked. nice better contact tracing it’s like getting help Feds Gladys, did. Lockdown referendum two days.

If Trump somehow wins, biggest repudiation Covid Panic anyone could ever imagine. Well countries successful applying restriction 

In case, supreme decree issued limiting constitutional rights freedom movement freedom association 

Police military enforce mandates also established fines complying 

Such fines go towards monthly utilities’ bills gotta pay unless wanna lose access clickbait. I’m Slovakia everyone know got tested yesterday today. antibody tests 80% accuracy, supposed follow testing next week catch remaining cases. publicly available Oura ring supposedly detect Covid Even medical masks meant source control too. “take make stick adequate mitigation efforts”

lol Wishful thinking, understand impulse. think lot doctors going dead over. sub already treats virus turns people zombies agree w/ you. effective vaccine could come soon, could take years. know fact, humans gonna human. cannot lockdown forever. need meaningful work, social interaction, education, etc. soon reaching tipping point tolerance. seen lockdown protests across EU? People going able shutter inside much longer. people, anyways directly across border Suarez, could something it. That’s do. generally feel like people appreciate it. look contempt know they’d love shout ‘sheep’ face. today, guy know approached greet, mask properly on, told three times - know, it’s mandatory mask outside. brings down, masks hated. House Senate Wisconsin controlled Republicans. purse strings get things done. legislature controls money law. governor merely executive. legislature grossly incompetent, makes difficult anything executive. _It real communism_ Russia 1/4 US covid deaths, adjusted population size. nothing Russia needs learn USA, probably know it. order everyone know someone died would take probably millions deaths. virus one ever seen doesn’t know treat. guess someone known do. 

You’d think we’d eradicated diseases now. We’ve plenty time. Yup, I’m teacher Phoenix. Luckily school district’s superintendent going follow old guidelines. one metric still red Thursday transitioning back online learning. We’ve hybrid since end September. 

It’s stressful, wish district stayed online least first semester. transition learning models like disruptive teachers planning, importantly students. People often thing within US order compare states. 

It’s personal attack, it’s way visualizing things. 

People thing height weight distance time, re-frame terms familiar conceptualize. downvote comment?... regardless perspective pandemic he/she right. No! They'll lock *third* time, first two *real* lockdowns! rallies pretty much guaranteed super spreader events right? another thing people understand covid. number covid deaths we're worried whether hospitals able cope surge covid patients. mean sure covid deaths right alot lower compared March good hospitalisation rising covid easily cause hospitals become overwhelmed longer cope confusing ""being arrested infected"" ""being arrested complying regulations"".

The difference latter choice, unlike former. Nope. middle ground. Either stay home sacrifice mental health you’re literally murderer. it’s safe say survived one begging go back work, guess mate, people work payment receive, know hard understand concept let break even further.

 work = money.

Do understand now? working PUTTING FOOD BLOODY TABLE can’t miss it, you’re it. Bleak AF winter, vaccine somewhere around spring, general populous summer. I’m guessing you’ll see masks 2022, mask compliance start dwindle vaccine starts getting pumped out. That’s guess.

Bottom line see 0 chance anyone willing lose another summer this, absolutely another holiday cycle.

Before downvote, keep mind “safest route” “most likely outcome” two different things!! Paywall Look, right risk tolerance comfortable staying home that's totally right. people make choices take risks behalf others every day pretend don't. order food, somebody go food store people work grocery delivery apps pick driving home. may live risk family members people rely public transit using family car deliver food.

Is significant risk? Probably not, certainly light fact need eat somehow. also strike significantly less risky going store get groceries, spending times outdoors, number activities reasonably low risk good people's physical mental health. Everything risk. Part mentally healthy adult learning balance acceptance unavoidable risk responsibility foolhardy things. they'll rethink approach it'll clear restrictions work [Scientists warn Americans expecting much White House many Americans pinned hopes defeating COVID-19 pandemic vaccine developed “warp speed.” scientific experts warn they’re expecting much, soon.

Called it. still need socially distance wear masks vaccine. warned you, nobody listened! Boring. 

This bs happened March April. Panic mongering. Many Americans denial happening politics disinformation. clueless people impacted wouldn’t care point, also infect normal people. Here's latest case/death charts El spiked course. deaths still remain flat.

El Paso currently 75.64 deaths per 100k population. ranks 807th US per capita overall looks slightly Popped lil bit vicodin everything seems fine... Makes sense me. Cuomo needs “the reaper” nickname though. guy insane. THIRD???

Fauci says we’re “elongated first wave”. Yea, get memo? Goalposts moved order fit shaky narrative. Here’s guideline:

What fuck even thinking for? play devil's advocate trump never said covid self hoax. said media stating nothing caused much worse break ""new hoax"". fan trump shut travel China country start thing called racist xenophobe it. Another thing remember America operates federalist system. Trump technically power mandate nation wide mask mandates. even could probably conservatives believe governance issues decided state state basis. saying good bad. say former leftist voted blue entire life, media hell bent painting every single decision trump makes terrible vast majority people reddit. Good job, blow like countries. safe numbers low go outbreak easily large gatherings immunity last even get any. That’s smart government would do. Anyone U.S. thinks happen here? Absolutely none them? He's lonely needs hug. No, spreading truth. Would overkill even effective wear neck gaiter cloth mask? medium length beard current mask barely goes bottom chin feel like beard defeating entire purpose. Would adding neck gaiter top make difference? bring anyone in, paid  sound upset? important Sweden prioritizing testing resources? Implement actual enforced lockdown again. Closing non essential businesses closing schools unis also. requires universal basic income implemented stat furlough business keep running. daycare permanently shut, childcare now. radically change hours make work everyone that, universal basic income fucking pittance benefits give required. 
I know - ooooh socialism - decide important, economy lives. half measure saves neither. I’ve interacted three people said, “Don’t sorry, tested negative X amount weeks ago.” Like, could contracted since depending equal you’re doing. 

People poor understanding COVID. Jack’s complete lack surprise. congress pass another stimulus bill. Even did, $1200 drop bucket people.

 People also ok-ish last time extra unemployment money. happen again, lot states make impossible claim unemployment all. Almost Europe north San Francisco English link, I'd give it, hopefully google translate help bit article talking study lazy look study itself, 70% sensitivity rate according study Motol hospital discussed ad nauseum Slovak media cited government, vested interest making people believe highest plausible number there, plus sounds reasonable tests are.  It’s also accurate. government spent last 10 months creating infrastructure mass testing... 9/11 US. people allowed fly 3 days. countries Europe locked sustained period *zero* (not ""low"") cases kept borders closed? panels (bannable r/coronavirus reason)

Yeah, seems ""wrong"" certain extent, really, that's triage boils crazy situations... people thought ""beyond medical help"" left fend themselves. guess always hope ""superhero"" evolves this, end ""super vaccine"" side. never medics. Field masks reason. Oh stats aren’t American. 

Like 400k soldiers died ww2. 

Did media tell double?

This isn’t trump swine flu. shut whole country it? cause would batshit crazy family christmas 25 us. sit dinner fun, hectic day. isn't.
CDC COVID-19 Survival Rates:
Age 0-19 — 99.997%
Age 20-49 — 99.98%
Age 50-69 — 99.5%
Age 70+ — 94.6%
The data August significantly different now, survival rates deteriorate health care systems put increasing strain. honest, people even read posts anymore, downvote move on. Stay tuned I’m gonna argue we’re stuck ways, make realize unclear respect wants families don’t want risk.

This means friends whose families (or themselves) don’t want take risk, seeing them. Everyone see mutual understanding there’s risk involved. Spoons? Absolutely. reddit, there's rally one side see comments like ""omg look irresponsible are, hope infect grandma family suffers"" get upvoted stratosphere, endless protests looting riots huge groups, whole pandemic thing swept rug comments like ""social justice important cause stay home nothing"". hate Birx misguided. Birx knew got far line would replaced sycophant. compromised morals (as evidence later statements/actions) could stay position influence hopefully good sidelined. People treat Birx like Atlas frustrating watch. hindsight Victoria fucked lot things up, especially start. overall period lockdown could probably half long could done - starting earlier going straight full restrictions instead failed ""hotspots"" approach etc. that's part useful model rest world. get perfect right start. long learn what's gone wrong, go harder rather softer results coming, succeed.

NZ's success gets written world advantages - small size, acted early, outbreak never got big begin with. Vic far fewer advantages still pulled off. wake-up call world. Depends.  Let’s remember people protesting versus throwing stupid parties middle pandemic. protesting wearing mask, yes, charge them.  zero reason throwing optional party. Yeah, linked above. come big deal people died swine bird flus

To point trump tweeting Obama's impeachment


But 200k+ dead Americans, twice many died ww2, ""it's fine""



Either way, thread many tested positive two different states. One smaller population less testing.


Are allowed discuss spread world wide pandemic without somone crying un American?



I know guys care, butI'm sorry AMERICANS dieing. actually like country “Welcome apocalypse” spray painted garage

That picture sums sub  Boris Johnson didn’t want happen months ago, UK start second lockdown. England’s numbers still better per 100,000 population several states.

Getting whole country lockdown US would difficult, states might able manage it. concerned party like there's tomorrow able gather tight dirty places get drunk together anymore. concerned rent entire hotel hundreds come together get shitfaced. go belgium.. made it, number one! Hope cough it! triage. ""combat triage"" different thing.

Technically, they're *same* thing ... based around different ""rations"" available supplies. better still hand testing places give 3 weeks amount bag added voting ballot. see cases go location makes people asymptomatic carriers. Exactly people don’t adhere anymore - government got shit together prepared health services first lockdown well enforced masking earlier wouldn’t necessary. 

UKs first lockdown time South Africa’s (a country whose trajectory months behind) - way late UK trajectory. Good. hate masks could care less. Virginia 14.8 per 100k anecdote: month ago resting heart rate usual 50bpm 120. day two later, fever, chills, joint pain, nausea etc. 2 days later tested positive covid. check every child staff member every single day enter school. temperature usually hovering 91-94 degrees. I've never seen read higher 96. repost Daily Mail article. Enough said. Woowww easy kid, youre r/coronavirus. people would rather us lockdown 40+ years bunch old people die 82 (where would normally lived 83 instead). fact dont give shit literally anything (people suffering poverty depression result extended lockdowns, people dying undiagnosed diseases hospitals treat covid patients). fact literally scenario fine except people dying covid, even means theyll die factors caused endless measures I'm doctor, think viruses burn fairly quickly. think one could hang person months, could would infectious. Yes. ask? said many times, easy go lockdown unemployment rate 3%. Real unemployment Spain beyond 20%, people real economic issues get lockdowns similar measures. think it’s safe say contempt order coming.

Now alternate solution, think either, sobering thought Police Chief, matter actual employer is. Merkel said days ago Germany know origin 75% cases.  must ignoring per capita, us worse lot Western Europe. 

Or 99 percent recover. 

But yeah science says babies need masks everyone needs shelter place.   talk lot American exceptionalism, Canadian exceptionalism? Why, I'm thankful Australians placed interests country immediate wants needs? Seems like Europe US could use attitude. read article? Calm Mussolini. Wear mask. Wash hands. Keep 6 feet away.

Trump ain't worth killing over, know it. Wave 4: Demand starting normalize (although people nervous bit elevated). Supply chains drive. toilet paper lots it. People slowly getting acostom seeing full stock 

I've shopping work (senior living), toilet paper mostly back pre-pandemic stocking. 3-4 months available anywhere, came in, gone day, stores rationing. It’s enough. positivity rate nowhere close 30%. Maybe enough earlier, need mass testing now. Stop admitting anyone 70 40 bmi.  people France gone back hard lockdown weeks ago end all. live Selangor, one states higher case numbers, partial lockdown right now. less restrictive first lockdown back March almost everyone see outside wearing mask sometimes social distancing lacking. Many offices still open cinemas closed dine-in restaurants limited 2 4 persons depending state rules. Gyms open too.


The public mostly blaming politicians/government new wave covid cases because:

-The new wave started state Sabah, Borneo

-The Sabah border Indonesia/Philipines secure illegal immigrants came Sabah, covid

-The illegal immigrants caught put jail without tested, covid spread rapidly jail

-Despite rising cases, election held Sabah Sabahans flew country vote returned current states

-Returness Sabah advised home quarantine properly enforced compliance lacking, spreading covid states Malaysia

-Even though photos politicians ministers breaking lockdown guidelines, get fined there's clear double standard (this one really annoys people here) Might good time use emergency alert system. (You periodically hear radio ""this test.....if actual emergency....."")
Tell everyone masks mandatory, people REALLY getting sick hospital reaching capacity.
Maybe people heard direct government, would realize political joke? Stats anti american? highly doubt happen. Economically folks can't sustain another shutdown. first shutdown effectively failure, although buy time. Second time around would useless. Enough folks would ignore it, also shut schools widespread basis. Indeed. I've moved sort people well. many better things life sort folks.

To steal lyrics.. speak time testing done able analyze. Instead building queue decided freeze home tests days catch up. probably work towards increasing capacity.

If capacity can't increased probably see change recommendations get tested. Right anyone get tested, without symptoms. It’s also county gov it’s bit cutting nose spite face want square Governor getting petty issuing order contempt police chief. Governor get even petty that. many ways Governor make life miserable county, think it’s safe say contempt order coming. encouraging harm others? many times too? Shit happens gotta deal it. Like Trump may immune. anything wants think /s for?  flu vaccines. 

If people take it, problem. herd immunity reach I'm American. Article July. November. Seriously? Looks like many tests.  3K positive per day, 30% would imply 10k tests per day.  Seems low. Would agree protestors?

Edit: Thanks platinum harm, foul. Ty!   Absolutely cannot target enemy armed forces, enemy happen require collaboration everyone. 

When governments try draft assistance everyone, people make excuses need deserting and, unfortunately, even civilians collaborate enemy. Hopefully methane clathrates cause runaway climate change lifetimes climate deniers see wrong were, much cost planet, society falls around us all.

... /s? posts facebook even removed. test comes back negative would accuracy parts world. I'm sure breathalyzer better without sensitivity specificity data, 90% really worst among test methods. 70% 50% number news reports usually sensitivity, accuracy would upwards 95% Indonesia needs pine barrens read Michael Osterholm's ""Deadliest Enemies"" realize we're lucky. could much worse, we're unprepared. 

Despite warnings we've got past two decades (SARS, Zika, MERS ...) everybody's head sand. look risk pandemic influenza, ... ouch. heroes

You brainwashed dude/dudete.  best time plant tree twenty years ago. next best time now. Go Australia! Hell yes! Australia 🇦🇺 negative Nancy, could first step towards checking. Negative: great move on. Positive? Quarantine get follow swan test. 

Imagine could roll people weekly feel like exposed? Help get control. think can’t fake those? states like Jersey New York add *probable covid deaths* , Texas not. fact Covid isn’t listed primary cause death death certificate added count. Places like UK opposite add death list die reason within 60 days contracting Covid. immunomodulators helps? Sure, face face contact family members close friends fine every weeks probably needed sanity. know plenty people went 10+ person parties tonight. There’s need that. I'd gladly take day one. fact I've signed trial might get one day one. boyfriend work beer section grocery store; today one busiest days we've quite time everybody buying beer Halloween parties.

Meanwhile, know every single person working department exposed virus asymptomatic coworker. Work cover tests time needed go get said tests one us starts showing symptoms. Woo~ Yeah? Where’s yours? well way getting wish. much less ok.

Doing OK? twice population New Zealand reported three times many cases last two days New Zealand reported entire pandemic.

If that's definition ""doing OK"", I'd hate see consider ""doing badly"". blood work done two years ago, D3 deficient. taking supplement since. Subsequent tests show low-mid normal range, take regularly. :/ never far; hard shut downs work instantly stopping bleeding. Remember, governors independent authority shut regardless Trump wants. Nov 3, Biden wins, many governors likely take upon lockdown numbers continue sky rocket. Failed state. 

So sad Wa ""refusing help"" fair. many cases arrivr ship air. Kept exports full speed also helps pay pain nationally say really love speakeasies returned. History truly repeats itself.  Thank you. That's udder thing entirely. World Data much interesting graphs IMO. that's entertaining! think he'd probably gain votes. He's full shit time, many stupid people America. So, many... 1. Even examples counter point. measure think Germany *is not* performing United States containing virus? Yes, seeing resurgence, nowhere even close kinds numbers see America. also take countries even effective testing tracing systems, South Korea. case could also add effective promotion masks (has US government consistently effectively promoted use efficacy? think know answer). refuting point testing tracing stop spread virus-- *they do*. completely stop virus tracks, intended widespread community spread. Insofar failures US testing? I'm surprised seen widely reported information past six months. recently, US testing capacity far, far would need test kinds numbers needed get accurate picture current hotspots. kind capacity six months ago (and call ability done question, many months ago Asian countries testing hundreds thousands people week, US still hundreds tens thousands). actually idea level tracing needed, indeed states exceeded capacity necessary trace wide community spread-- New York front runner effort. Ultimately points would stand every democratic country experiencing pandemic equally severely, not. United States measurably worst country hit COVID world. performing worse India third world countries Africa Asia. look numbers see single greatest failure government history US?


2. fact things individual it, yet refuse. People still refuse wear masks. People still refuse stay home sick (and I'm even talking work-- see sick people public *still* grocery stores, etc). People get tested-- know self isolate needed. Same, stocked supplies today. Winter going rough. Well article read gave impression, possibly combination both. case, flu vaccine, sterilising still reduce spread flu, non-sterilising covid vaccine may well also contribute herd immunity degree. Depends look it. UK population much concentrated US population, that's going reflect statistics. 

Most US empty space, wheras UK villages. urban areas, US cities tend spawl lot wheras UK (and outside North American cities general) much compact. Oh yeah, like well prohibition worked! Going pre committed timelines didn’t work well first time world tried it, try again. /s I'll inform Taiwan South Korea despite double population density UK count removed virus populations. Many people moved family area. babysitters don’t want take care kids healthcare workers could infected. option many quit working.  Tell portfolio. Hiyo! definitely say people cusp able afford bills right now, let alone people almost unable eat... People cushy jobs pre lockdown got given upto £2.5k month sit home saving money, people breadline... ended breadline &lt;80%.

There always cost human lives throughout history, US charges people tens thousands dollars stay healthy, NHS routinely ""just"" enough months waiting. That's correct, came winter, we're pretty good shape. really hope (but doubt) Northern Hemisphere position 6 months now. Europe amirite? No, Fauci said Bingham said: may treat symptoms prevent illness. average person street would associate vaccine. time Biden able anything, genie far bottle make impossible get back in. cannot envision much pain store people elderly unwell. good thing death rate falling, hospitals get overloaded, that, also people urgent care needs go again. testing spring tiny fraction today.

That's bullshit. fraction, *tiny* fraction. close 10% current level, aimed likely virus, thus much higher positive Sweden probably 5-15 times 

Yes, FHM thought... antibody testing done Stockholm showed number people exposed virus much lower thought.

While agree likely numbers higher least part first wave, clearly reached peak second wave, every infected person identified (otherwise still spreading virus... would they?) 

What picking highest estimate previous cases, saying compared lowest possible number current cases order downplay current problem.  stores anywhere near enough man power people this. ""Speak yourself!"" kind thing. ......And I'm staying home Halloween. South Dakota ‘s 7 day trailing average test positivity rate 47% according John Hopkins. would scared life lived specially winter coming... Woah, that's ***hasty generalization*** right there! Hey Ohio, anti mask trump psychos threatened Dr. Amy Acton point resigned. spineless governor gave moment trump threatened cut money. Guess what? virus still running rampant Dewine asking nicely people wear masks. That’s plan now.  know, allergies. Ragweed oak pollen. Well controlled point. thought might sneeze cough, I’d wear mask. live mandatory public mask area anyway, face shield could useful home reduce in-home transmissions. 30-50% transmissions occur homes. current debts ramping though that's understand. Social security Medicaid going start coming general fund. game big boys already know it. there's going kind change, new system, know. Texas number one! Solutions problems Lmao filthy faggoty communist. Dearh tou ddirty marixist cuntss *Living virus* entail taking necessary precautious, fuck's sake. I'm downplaying virus. I'm saying unlikely catch MILE away outside. likely, risk catching every time stepped outdoors, since likely well within mile lots people time. Same. refuse kill elderly mother. Fines, massively expensive scale. Due immediately,garnish wages. would way compliance. Still all, majority notice checkbook gets put isolation. positive test means done person campaigning. Announcing would show level honesty virus current administration doesn’t don’t see would hurt politically. also would likely access best medical care despite age would unlikely die it. Go it. hear test again, reason hear antibodies testing anymore. Except antibodies testing estimated 95% accuracy.  Calm down, Satan. Maybe could check sources? Even search random website tells opposite. American public policy sets [value high. Somewhere around $9 million per life. Another measure (much lower, applicable age-scaling disease) dialysis standard: $129,000 per year life.

Applying mortality COVID suggests average infection costs $10,000 mortality alone. Hospitalization costs (covered insurance, ultimately means coming pockets) probably comparable higher.

At least 50% population bears essentially none risks, society we're going end paying all. Letting old people die poor keep alive mark wealthy society. i'm pro-mask whatnot, type law asking abused police result massive civil liberties violations  thought defeated [Bhaganagar discovered coronavirus aerosol particles spread 1 2 kilometers, little friends family got covid. fuck downplaying virus. Can't shoot virus sad USA resort comparing emerging nations find comfort ots response.

You don’t test rates successful countries contact tracing effective public health policies none existent.

Give break. mass events always existed human societies. Colosseum built randomly. I'm sorry. know better experts government admitting 14%. people could catch year instead 2-3x increasing risk.

Stop lying. Well, longer surprises me. Freeze rent utilities? cloud cuckoo land think America is? Caring people freezing streets dying hunger? That’s socialist talk! American website. always trouble understanding difference ""UK"", ""Britain"" ""England"".

It's particularly amusing comes history things like talking William Wallace fighting save Scotland British. Biden given coronavirus plan yet? know sides plan ignore wish idea exaclty Bidens plan involves. wont really matter vote would give better piece mind. Remember SD Governor declined LWA state awesome again? Pepperidge Farms remembers. bogus fast math side: 1% infected. R0 2 means one infected infects two others. lets say new infected manages infect two others 6days. (the world) tests isolates cases, much slower stopped lockdown.

Selfish, purposefully ignorant people afraid confront them. heard black home illegal large swathes south. told anyway. plan wait vaccine. That's it. Golf banned list. go serious. Take you, I’ll carry bags! late; need get Trump executive branch government actually functioning.

Biden lead coordinated effort tell actively encourage governors follow guidelines shutdown community transmission way high. I'm acting differently based fact think effective vaccine, make difference. think signs good. case Fauci thing mentioned seems take vaccinate everyone, vaccine good. Well...it wouldn’t covid death. problem solved? /s get results back there's 10% chance they're wrong.

Yikes Yea sorry... now. That's like shutting stable door horses bolted.

That point.

Your plan Ill thought out. 

Doesn't factor supy chains food, medicine businesses depend open borders.

You're creating bigger problem. mean
You could go, maybe? We've one, yes, second lockdown? Lol putting blame China shitty job done. common US, elections near, post article like official state site. like making propaganda yourself, using power state. I'm saying celery going cancel thanksgiving, I'm saying lack specific ingredients may trigger something people. Ha, totally. left /s thought obvious.

A self fulfilling prophesy. 

Before everybody starts stripping shelves, I'll get extra. Thank goodness I’m essential business Plus, NZ Melbourne first properly lockdown elimination, Melbourne Indiana Jones sliding gate barely grabbing hat last moment.

Melbourne breaking point cases wise. Even Dan beginning make statements like ""this might good gets"" cases falling &lt;5 last weeks.

People end rope. motivation states locking us Australia without elimination WELL starting 700 cases vs tens/hundreds thousands cases countries. 

I think Melbourne uniquely motivated advantaged outside inside forces get finish line. actually know major european country could achieve without extreme long term restrictions. I'm sure stuff earned Catholic Church totally pillaged Crusades. Also it’s usually reporters/authors choose titles. publications, it’s chief editor picks headlines. city church camp/revival started 18 cases kept climbing. pushed hybrid learning schools back week. get want kids back classrooms, cases state, state mask mandate.. climbing fast. really dont see ""in"" school going forward Yes us. doctor considered giving large vitamin treatment said thing achieved long term constant supplement. also wanted make life habit instead one time treatment.

My recent bloodwork shows correct. back 24 ng/mL.  Trust me, we're happier it. honest, hard shoot idiots clearly care lives lives others. remember IHME predicted late November would end summer. Three months ago followup comment niceee scariest thing watching unfold another year is... China might actually new world superpower. Eeeeek Oh yeah work fast food place manager instructed us we're required insist people wear masks bc, words, ""it's job take abuse it"". might ask people wear masks look like give shit sometimes judge correctly someone forgot.

Either way, lot customers get aggressive restrictions anyway. Try insisting sitting table service since collected takeaway order cant sit wait see they're gonna accept shout push sit anyway, obviously agree track trace either. worth insist.

People genuinely getting mad minimum wage workers government rules. insane. schools main culprit current rising rates globally also necessary dental appointment, already decided masks would I'd go somewhere else treatment. trying shame you, saying plan ahead limits are. Same! know countries social distancing thing long Covid without law needed ? wear mask you’re sick, respect people’s space, good hand hygiene. one finds complicated, oppressive freedom, it’s part culture civilized healthy country. 
And guess what, nation ones least impacted pandemic ! would thought listening health experts key getting rid virus? nations health virus. IE. USA fat avoids doctors specifically said premier league goes ahead normal. it’s essential people kick ball bit grass. put every North Dakotan single square mile still socially distance 6 feet. It’s scared getting sick. It’s want live normal life, without restrictions, distancing, crowding limits masks. Exactly, blaming government people partying streets storming pubs festival Samhain Swine flu 0.01% IFR. funnily rainbow crowd always daily thread. Maybe concerted action conspiracy sub downvote every reasonable post here. that's case, I'm sorry downvoters brainwashed idiot influencers morons. Please visit /r/medicine see shit joke overblown. anyone skeptical lockdowns, need look State Victoria see cooperation, lockdown indeed decrease number cases way zero. New Zealand too. 

I'm denying negative impacts economy mental health etc need cooperation support everyone go together rate anything possible, nobody thought 100,000 cases day possible. sense smell come back? One reasons I'm worried get stories peoples smell/taste gone permanently. fair, author use quotes correctly, quoted article. also really misleading. headline, cherry pick.

Really man? think absurd comparison affront opinion. Anyone could say comparison absurd offends sensibilities. ...except, India 'cannon fodder'. expect end well current trends. ever busy event it’s pretty norma true Wuhan, international medical experts knew nothing virus beginning, shutdown, isolation, building 3 specialised hospitals ground up, wearing PPE masks Wuhan SAVED China could spread provinces WORKED. countries enforced similar shutdowns, social distancing wearing masks realised ignoring situation going work. example Victoria, mandated wearing masks 2 months ago month shutting state cases still rising dangerously. laxed approach idiots protesting lockdown wearing masks prolonged recovery process three months. November now, Wuhan recovered late March. friends China back work school, people holidaying travelling domestically again. Wuhan may handled situation dramatically everywhere else (who blame them?), resulted recovering earlier getting back normal. **China everything right, Singapore, Japan Korea started allow regular flights China**. one wants connect us yet (let alone UK US). think we've enjoyed stuck home majority 2020? course not. Sure! that's envy anyone type leadership. think important able gather friends, I've done homes outdoors, even restaurant patios. people less risk tolerance. mixed bag risk tolerances without mandates restricting either what's causing tension. probably necessary tension, still tension. phase 2 results Oxford: OK combined phase 1 2, still passed bar phase 2.

Of course trials guarantee, 11 run. Yes trials set primarily see vaccines reduce symptoms, stop infection full stop. preclude so. We've always payed back though.  government pays 2‐3% interest per year money we've borrowing, even better year suddenly government borrow like 0.5-1% people still snatch treasury bonds. least trying something it. mean I'm big ole law nerd long commission royal one properly authorised guess go right ahead?

Daniel relates story friends got infected North Fakota. One died. given anything close current understanding treatment! Still using ideas Mar ch. 

Daniel explains testing keep schools open.

He explains periods phases covid :
Franework 

1. Pre-exposure - minimize likelihood exposure: avoid exposure, masks, distancing , ventilation, cleaning, hygiene, control pre-existing conditions. Active passive immunization. Maybe even pre-exposure prophylactic.

This want vaccines there. Controversy issue vaccines. get flu shot

2 incubation period - tough window 6 feet 15 minutes cumulative - jump therapy- monoclonals

3.detectable viral loads : chance keep people hospital (ex: remdesivir / monoclonal antibodies helpful ventilator viral symptom time might helpful. ) Info monoclonal antibodies didn’t describe.. help person comorbidities 62 keep hospital. used infusion delivered home. 

Convalescent plasma - benefit, role uncertain, plasma given late 

A viral symptoms stage ( treated above)

B early inflammation ( cytokines, hypocogulation)combination steroids toleslesimid stop cytokine storm treat patients 

Can use heparin, aspirin, etc 


C.early infection phase - staph aureus, pneumonia, bacteremia

D.hyperinflamatory phase ( MIS-A MIS-C) high pete cent people ANAs, etc. pattern seen lupus arthritis. Starting learn mechanisms leads long tail phase.

E -tail phase know black death might inadvertently lead directly age enlightenment might something.

After vaccine put reddit posts thru truth reconciliation commission. 

Part ‘but muh rights’ crowd? 
Hmmmmmm........ refuse wear mask continue gather go nothing happening. keeps spreading fast. So, country getting arse handed covid fucking year long? 

or dead magically pop back feet weather warms up? 

Such joke. Phase 2 finished.

The trials run simultaneously.

They made Phase 1.  Running trials guarantee succeed.

And since bar set fairly low, shedding notion vaccine necessarily preventing illness. Oh, well 2 weeks absolutely. reacting 20 part... gotcha. likely unable post main sub bc account age, evidence certain someone helped situation also explains Jeb Bush lost badly Trump 2016. elder Bush famous talking New World Order positive sense, made whole family part conspiracy. According worldometer, 0.6% population has/had covid. Obviously, numbers underreported. even add 10 million suppose country, 1.4%, still less compared countries. think news article wrong, maybe. FYI there’s vegan D3 now. It’s made lichen. Either way, wanna use D3 supplementing. let die. Lock downs don’t anything starve population released phase 2 results. ‘But muh rights!’ folks like need get credit deserve!

Or merely ignorant/lazy google yourself?

In words, fuck about, mate? still absolutely mind-blowing think rip entire state less year half rate. I'm boat. tell friends straight I'm hanging partying them. think confused first. one went EDC 3 nights last year I'm passing hang outs time. Stay strong keep head down. got this. Yeah age ""opinion important fact"" needs buried excess corona dead ignorant gifted us. Please spend like five seconds researching history Reconstruction, KKK, Jim Crow, 1950s, 1960s, 1996 Atlanta Olympics bombing, part pre-1860 US history.

We're comparing southern white people literal terrorists. Many thousands southern white people (stereotypical not) literal terrorists. running Phase 3 trials without completed Phase 2. USA! USA! USA! Wait one chanting?  Taiwan island. Australia island. NZ island. Borders infinitely easier contain. Besides Taiwan knew transmittable human human Dec 2019 knew deadly was. better prepared anywhere world deal it. China suppressed months Taiwan tried tell world. 11 phase 3 studies right now. Clearly lot work put them. Many likely join phase 3. I'm suck idiot buying calls know could just.... pay people? could wear mask tho. coworker mine population control bs. Every point made completely ludicrous easily rebutted. Look Georgia guidestones example. 

Then showed video Bill Gates explaining preventing child infant mortality reduced birth rates. meant population control. tried explain obvious fact outcome better health care around world it’s good thing seemed go right head. 

The thing is, guy professional engineer. recite entire sections Monty Python Holy Grail memory. he’s nice guy. genuinely like him. stuff it’s like part brain went missing. 

I little research population control mentioned found goes way back John Birch Society 1950s. mentioned response was, “Yeah, know.” time, thought meant didn’t take seriously. realize meant takes really seriously. 

To think absolutely crackpot idea spread beyond fringe truly frightening. hope too. ""hoping"" right thing do? people pay forced accountable? I've never one talk revenge sort crime, whole virus handling overwhelming me. fair, widespread now; encouraged isolated areas short periods time. totalitarian regime intervene people's private issues like Halloween party! / badteeth joke spawned 200 years ago insult British royal family, famous inbreeding. No, fact. made-up justification concocted convince okay put others risk selfish forego hanging friends in-person.  describing, no. math may here, right now, least 80,000 cases per day 7 day rolling average. Let's call 500,000 active cases need monitored followed contract tracing. U.S. 3,000 counties, given time, that's 150 cases need investigated implement contact tracing. counties probably manpower expertise (some larger ones obviously support that, they'd probably cases too). anecdotal, hear stories time kids social services falling cracks dead months someone realizes supposed welfare check 6 months ago. Moral story best way keep novel virus cases low let get high first place, assuming feasible.


Right now, probably thing U.S. go hard educating people age related risk, main indicator hospitalization morbidity.
People 50 live strongly encouraged social distance/quarantine incentives tailored older people. Remote opportunities sabbatical, etc. offered 50 first dont know would 've legal states govt would make temporarily legal. solve pandemic might save additional 200-400k lives safe effective vaccine found distributed. problem talking terms anytime mention majority deaths elderly, people think saying ""Screw old people!"". No, fact deaths elderly means good job informing people relative risks providing options cope risks. think psychological aspect telling people 3 month lockdown. People hear really upset whereas 4 week lockdown palatable people might follow rules. Obviously extended drip feeding bad news better option government honest start. Don’t worry, will. Slowing spread exactly told goal beginning. “Flatten curve”. Every country world killed goal, goals increased now. Jesus Christ run crystal MLM business forced. Boris wanted announce parliament Monday, newspapers online outlets leaked Friday night choice rush press conference tonight. one hour per day go outside, 1KM around max. write paper exact time wakl carry us.

Last lockdown, first, people taking dog outside jogging allowed go (+ medical reasons / work / groceries). everybody dressed jogger. still write paper. Yeah earlier sometimes welded doors shut keep people moving around. 

The sole advantage dictatorship able tell citizens crisis.

I agree, spectacular they've achieved this. country massive. government near absolute control people's lives, might possible.

Meanwhile, US, exact opposite happening. dire results. people freakishly dystopian perspective. year already struggle middle virus peaking prospect even medical interventions daunting. Five years absolute non-starter. mental health ramifications staying home month? Christmas must rough, I'm surprised anyone makes summer. mean professional jealousy? going Christmas shopping non-essential shops shut?

People 'bout start getting asda caterpillar cakes Christmas. international travel. doesn’t necessarily go hand hand tourism. literally healing properties magic crystals. Careful, use word prob get post deleted *England. don’t disagree. know others sentiment you, still right thing. Lockdown plan support recently self employed. put debt BBL. What's going announced next, debt options? Lucky people full time jobs give single fuck, work home, unlike many people know can't claim anything get furlough recently self employed, jobs like hairdressers carpenters, can't make income get fucked government.

I guess we'll another eat help back lockdown February. one. read vaccine news daily. many tourists year globally? Argue want, U.K. wasn’t basing divisions that. 

Keeping airlines running (for number reasons including business, travel back U.K. yes, tourism) dormant mean lockdown avoided whole summer months tourism reasons. Logistically fucking nightmare yes surely worth making attempt saying impossible? science right indicating children may transmit less adults. that's case schools closed restaurants, gyms place non necessity closed. many many reasons closing schools bad point feels like they’re deliberately timing fuck every time get closer finding flat move into. young kids limited groups, least US. 5th 6th grade, everyone crowding hallways moving classroom classroom. already Yeah, small restaurants permanently close, employees made career service industry can’t afford live more.....yeah, never mind them, they’re expendable Lol joke? Everything said fact checked. many months next lockdown happens ever get one He's even member Conservative Party. self-serving adjenda basically destroy Britain. think cares 'party' basically everyone Whitehall hates exception Johnson Gove. sub it’s rule-bar. substantiated children vectors virus virtually invincible it? I've saying near March (when country announced would following Swedish model closing schools) school thing entirely schools effectively babysitting measure parents. close schools, parents need home means employees lot jobs.

Currently people starting wonder good idea since huge number kids either quarantine lockdown point. aunt pulled kid school getting stern emails teachers needed put back class... case came son's class 3 classes (IIRC) mandatory quarantine. Ironically includes son, home. sure you’re getting downvoted. definitely remove political posts. NPR link actual screenshots. would piss too. I'm glad (assumedly) catch covid. fair, probably say anything either. people getting violent told put masks on, dangerous say something. im bristol one lowest case-rate areas country start uni term, huge spike... bristol university classes almost entirely online already far, biggest increases Baltimore City, Baltimore County, MoCo, PG. looking like similar spread we've seen previously.

Counties like Washington Frederick seeing increases relative ""typical"" levels, they're still 30s 40s per day, whereas others listed 150s 170s. insane dystopian future, yes. live hotspot I’ve least 20 different people come knocking door Halloween (I assume). can’t believe I'd imagine remaining uninfected people, assuming confirmed cases fraction two total. disease could've wiped April everyone done part, continues rage control...

Selfish stupid people: give big pat back! not. people make way. political Italy, UK, Spain France? No...it not. Quit making political report facts. It’s simple. really bizarre going lockdown states roasting us it. Like, come on, guy. Us going lockdown keeping elderly mum NSW safe. mock firefighters they're keeping bushfires bay well? Yes, think private companies really right thing protect staff. interest everybody sick quarantined time. place also goes way beyond required seems work. related Sturgis? (I know that's SD, wondering festival impact region.) summer there's plenty outdoor stuff do, even places locked down. Yeah planning staying home anyway. done press conference announced? much expect government competent officials? God tories embarrassing. travel corridors purely international tourism. god. look ""chip cob"" is, God's name people even doing? Like fries bad enough, need bread well? take vitamin supplements without putting crap like bread milk body science much still gathered worldwide increasingly suggesting schools hot spots coronavirus infections.""

Sure virus spreads everywhere schools last resort many reasons 0.6% population region Bergamo died ""first wave"" (and PFR obviously lowest bound IFR). 

(it's still Black Plague indeed, though) want clarify ""visiting doctor"" actually 'care' included giving receiving. elderly folks need could still cared necessary, including things like taking doctors appointments. Auto crashes kill 3500 people day US alone. Maybe shouldn’t driving either situation. outside summer big covid spreader. 4 kids small house, summer could go outside lots fun stuff. Usually winter would take indoor gyms playgrounds, that's shut down, basically 4 kids small house nowhere go.

Lock downs easy single introvert. hard everyone else. Pro science equal pro lockdown. Evil people listen to/understand science know tens/hundreds thousands unnecessary deaths still support restrictions whatsoever. That's greed narcissism. Whether mods like not, virus become political issue. I've seen plenty people challenged shops employees wearing mask. Seen even told leave - amicably course. Never got violent.

I guess depends live, people whole taking seriously am. Feels bad everywhere, feel extra Italy hit incredibly hard early year essentially served warning everyone else think there’s happy medium “no fun allowed” “400 person party pandemic”. deaths per capita. Canada's graph goes 1/10 U.S. crossing U.S. 2+ months. 

I understand. Well, science denier running state. That’s first issue. Incitng people gather large numbers contravening governmental health mandate regarding gathering large numbers stop spread deadly virus illegal.

Do call everyone names understand something? matter demographic take deaths consequences generations well:

-Real estate firms buy lot property forget home ownership

-Health Care industry targets new generation make profits. Remember ""Pharma Bro""? imagine lot common medications. Insulin US already Aspirin +2000%, Covid long term effects better gut like cap. Better live close Canada/Mexiko.

-Since older demographic died automatically means need many jobs several years. 

-Not grandparents anymore would run something credit? E-xac-tly. That’s exactly international tourism it??!!.. that’s different regional domestic rules. feed U.K. coffers one.. discussions decision would take lockdown measures, keep guessing without actual information. Idiot. rural pub south east area strongly conservative also 80% brexit, give general idea clientele, vast majority anti lockdown intention completely isolating. 

Give month hearing family, friends colleagues testing positive daily basis thet soon change attitude.

I tier 3 quite literally everywhere, every day hear people know testing positive, know people 2nd set 14 day isolation due different family members testing positive. According math, number cases minus number recovered minus number deaths, 3,103,208 people COVID states. Actual title:

*Someone's Leaked Covid-19 Hospitalization Data Trump's Kept Wraps* disgraceful needs enforced all. can't honor request wear masks? hard that? can't even believe people US protesting masks. absolutely appalling . I'm ashamed mankind. level selfishness unfortunate. Ah, like talk someone friends 🥺 asked question doorbell rang many trick treaters tonight. co-workers sharing town vacations upcoming holiday celebrations family flies another state. (Human human [symptoms symptoms] surface human, airborne human). It’s difficult folks stay diligent, new many. high price lapse judgement. crazy pills, eh? rewrite history. 355 ICU beds Minnesota guarantee nearing beyond capacity. likely millions Americans like chugging along daily grind living largely life before

Those Americans overwhelmingly disproportionately college-educated, older, male, white. 

Those getting hit hardest subjected worst conditions (teachers, service workers, hospitality workers) overwhelmingly disproportionately less-educated, younger, female, minority. 

Are arguing since people always winning still winning, it’s necessary anything help people always losing? it’s okay sent one check seven months ago Millenials haven’t hit career stride yet? 

Did miss part food bank lines wrapped around miles regular feature? demonstration healthy capitalist economy healthiest? like temperature check get work everyday Agreed - times per captia measure useful others misleading That's said ""rights"". blows mind Health care workers still can’t get proper ppe. Early pandemic could see reason, everyone buying up. far along. go store street grab bunch boxes shit. can’t people get tools need far in? Unreal 20%? they're outcomes fair, they’ve hired 14000 nurses built 13 nightingale hospitals. obvious answer government mandating masks, makes special comply like everyone else? miss good old days conspiracy loons reptiles secret societies. people gambling chips invisible virus real; like I'm gonna hedge bets something invisible? Big brain time. one thoughts pandemic: anyone launches bioweapons here, we're screwed. Yes, buy things cuz media tells me. correlation true people go back points - stupid cause. agree. Kate Bingham sounds like real Debby downer. statements pessimistic. might right might also wrong. shit article. think North Dakota worse Wisconsin. spread seems higher adjusted population (source: Worldometer) Listen know spread Human animal comes Human child science isn’t there. cool need prevent symptoms like flu vaccine we're back lives, yearly booster shots  D2 D3 vitamin D.

If supplementing, take D3, effective. True. Exactly current government wants. people care voting people don’t care, voting. area work “work home possible socialise household indoors” weeks now. person department currently working home (we capable of, great success March/April). people department seem think virus non-existent. One particular adamant immune (despite antibody test came back negative). continuing lives normal. honestly feel like responsible person entire company. ever give up! Never somew everyone it. right thing do. Rn right thing wear mask social distance. Keep it. Likewise. white, need make due. go outside nearly long enough. take 1,000 UI. good diet take 1000 UI every often, like 3very day, go outside time time, fine. Problem vitamin adds up, takes build up. people take 2,000 - 5,000 UI think that's kill. elderly people special health conditions taking much. heard? We've turned corner. much? see use high amounts like 5000 IU's co-factors, K2-Mk7 magnesium etc, looks complex People get knickers twist anything. 4 days explore stoke. Quick question Costa considered essential ? See? can’t trust him! /s getting harder give there's almost positive light visible end this. people giving up, brainwashed, wearing masks, numbers still hitting time highs, seeing numbers like 2022 vaccines demographic, people saying might even create collective immunity enough people take it.

What realistic way US? Keyword, realistic? public health measures become politicized seems likely many US would risk health everyone around order promote ideological affiliation

That like painfully true.

Also article mostly talks national contact tracing plan would followed effective, whoever wondering. ""Britain going roughly month-long lockdown coronavirus cases surge, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced Saturday, 3 months telling Telegraph want mandate national lockdown likened measure ""nuclear deterrent."" 
From November 5 December 2, people permitted to leave homes for short list reasons, childcare, work, exercise, medical issues, shopping basic needs. Bars restaurants allowed provide take-out options non-essential stores close. Johnson said country extending furlough system December help businesses."" dude works local Drug store, without formal education probably knows diagnostic medicine general
Public.... school People generally understand concept analogies. According people (a la friend here), compare two things, making morally equivalent. 

Also according friend, okay cause spread virus something noble society, include helping kids normal childhood. goal posts moved almost immediately since beginning. continue move. Ahahahahahaha. Ah Americans Americans. love lot. money ends going fixed costs. realistic imply writ large people need budget effectively. stimulus unemployment support, consumption *will not* go back prepandemic levels virus brought control. fair. smart people comply it. dumb/selfish ones won't. like here. germ incubators, it’s futile nationwide lockdown allowing still attend school.

Hard disagree. major goal nationwide lockdown slow spread overwhelm hospitals. goal get cases 0. Getting cases 0 almost hopeless, lots things like hospitals, groceries, etc can't close. 

Any measure take limit distancing slow spread, help limit hospitals overwhelmed. got til Thursday third world means can't count, yes. Lmao. mixed bag honestly. believe lockdown installed back start October least.

Well... No, cos also think Universities (one big spreaders) never opened September possible tougher measures coming lockdown 1 would prevened lockdown 2. 

And think public trust government eroded significantly compared lockdown 1 various reasons. makes doubt many people actually going abide it...

And universities still open whilst many small businesses serious danger shutting good going forced close even though IMO way around...

But shit, something needs done. Quite clearly regional measures half-arsed, confusing ineffective.

It's really simple favour not. bit anxiety producing, reading people getting sick working home contact others.

I one week living roommate, week we've got high cases around here, takes bus everyday works office. I've got windows open, freezing, hate this.

I feel like lot people think big deal sort safety net around them, family help pick slack. I'm scared incapacitated way prevents working extended period, I'm single do/pay everything myself. come circlejerk minute, otherwise need ""brave"" face work such. problem amount sugar stuff often add help cover taste vitamins added food. problem Canada too.

Cummings powerful touch. Give fifty years it'll start leaking many BoJo's crew skeletons closet Cummings knows about. Reddit one big circlejerk No. Never give up. better. well, bit... still funny! lol no.
The whole world barred. Even Aussies overseas trouble getting in, it’s straight mandatory quarantine. single digit daily case numbers don’t fuck around. Goodbye mental health jobs millions people. picture top (the thing actually see) insane. Canada. Ahhhh yes old “the kids won’t happy kill grandma!” argument. It’s always fun false equivalency. 

Have fun explaining kids impaired social skills years pandemic justified keep inside months end. I’m sure they’ll thrilled mattered little. 

I’m saying kids carelessly transmitting covid grandparents, dude. elderly poor health staying inside careful around. doesn’t mean take kids trying learn part social community interact others sufficiently. That, me, important thing stay open pandemic. Except catch Covid. talking people going vacations stuff like that. There’s difference visiting family deathbed going vacation. Today Saturday. deaths yesterday ( Friday ) ? trying keep us long knew back it, good. June-October nice little run, we're right back started now. 40% people sex time graduate high school. 80% time graduate college. Ask people go drink meet people year? going happen. Maybe month two tops, point, young people horny. hope get sick then? maybe die?  probably testing everything deal new type disease. That's Europe trying do.

Melbourne going complete elimination though again, really comparable. rate every person ND caught Covid-19 523 days. 

Today's number equal 286 hospitalizations 20%

40 deaths 2.8%

If numbers stay 500 day state way trouble currently is. 500 day within small pop. consistently hitting people affect everyone's daily life. Teachers dropping daily. many children raised grandparents due drugs jail. Who's gonna run mom pop restaurant farmers use daily. things think everyday numbers come out. agree you’d fool believe numbers country, except maybe NZ.

Actually scratch that, happen till get president. Flu spread children school. Australian schools closed months, whereas many US children back school months. Flu probably circulate much US recent years due social distancing, seem comparing northern hemisphere countries southern hemisphere countries valid. I'm reminded Fauci shooting Rand Paul congressional hearing Fauci said something along lines ""comparing US Sweden irrelevant, whereas comparing Sweden rest Scandinavia is"".

Even though influenza circulates globally similar strains found world similar points time, genetics flu circulate genetics spread different countries bit mysterious. current prevailing hypotheses South East Asia seeds influenza seasons Europe US. Cambodia experiencing flu outbreaks right strains good match chosen years northern hemisphere flu vaccine. next couple months going illuminating regards global influenza transmission. It’s gonna get worse. work radiology Miami hospital tell patients visitors multiple times put mask on. literal hospital. I’ve patients wearing mask decide randomly stop wearing reason. Honestly I’ve really started flipping yelling cursing patients honestly ain’t gonna fire pandemic. come hospital take mask fuck you. giant fuck you. Cereal already do... (Canadian) 


And others pointed out. take fucking multivitamin. Take two, eat real food fucking idiots. People “stay inside vaccine” going regret vaccine still isn’t around 5 years later. bet 200k day within 2 weeks now. seem following EU trend, lagging bit might popular rural places nationally support hovers 40%. never cracked 50%. Yep. Australia really difficult flu season last year due particularly nasty strain. year, it’s incredibly low rates vaccination quite high  I’ll say peak predicted higher. already know virus potential overwhelm health systems e.g. Lombardy. facts. “A small percentage people” meaningless, obviously takes small percentage people overwhelm healthcare systems. It’s like there’s bed ventilator every person! Exactly. 2.8% truly, truly stupendous number. It’s apparently something “outdoors” I’ve heard much about.  I'm starting feel like social leper tbh. wanna keep head finish internship keep household safe feel like everyone treating like straightedge buzzkiller. met outside distanced hangouts vidchats similar, going packed bar halloween? That's worst place D: Like much europe well summer need compulsory PROPER mask usage, another 2-week lockdown, severe penalties violation Covid protocol, campaign scientifically accurate information spreads.

People know got ask themselves:

Did wear properly fitted mask times outside home?

Did avoid gatherings size much possible?

Did wash hands, skin surfaces would exposed bioaerosol? 

Did disinfect surfaces groceries, delivered packages, mail, items brought home?

Did disinfect soles shoes entering home?

Did use appropriate concentration type alcohol, bleach, hydrogen peroxide? 

Did limit spend time maskless follow previous precautions? 

It's lot ask people do, taking every precaution best chance avoid contracting virus. I've everything since day one, spouse essential workers area poor mask enforcement. We've stayed safe go way keep us way. hard, tedious need make habit. self satisfy? LOL control damn horniness. animals heat now? species de-evolving? Might well animals cave men can't control horniness get infected infect someone else. comparing partying total disregard towards health others middle deadly pandemic black brown targeted police due skin color.
Got question mark op, exactly sure meant bad news. thing I've heard people considered bad news.


And that's worst, people 55 likely die Covid-19 get whatever issues vaccine gave. see [biography Full hyperboles, especially COVID section, compared pages former Presidents First Ladies. calculating 103%? Lockdown_31_October_Final.final.4.finalthistime 2.ppt seriously misunderstood comment, maybe try improving reading comprehension. point nothing actual societal merits protests.

Did see articles saying protests cause mass outbreaks covid, even though virtually social distancing going on? virus type ethical compass willingly leave protestors alone cares much systemic racism America police force.

If masks enough groups thousands people social distancing without causing massive outbreaks, they're enough small groups people going trick-or-treating. Yeah, friend works hotel, NHS bought hotel rooms country first lockdown could move staff needed. hotel went risk bankruptcy, completely full NHS staff matter days. Thank God won’t happen US. vast majority people care cba change daily routine ""going way"" break rules. ignoring next many... many restrictions put place enforced either.

Rules matter they're enforced brings back previous post. ""I get humanity so... Dumb?""
We bunch trained monkeys inflated egos. us evolved others even best us perfect. virus destroying Europe, takes hard left skips U.S, worries correlation likely weather turning.

In saying though US always seemed weeks behind Europe since start pandemic. 2019 feels like lifetime ago. Hell, February 2020 feels like lifetime ago. Feels like entered tunnel time slowed March left yet. still two months left, easily bleakest entire year given COVID trending right now. least have... videogames? Fuck fear mongering almost guarantee what's gonna happen, I'd put mortgage could. 4 week lockdown, rates drop unis says little lighter, ease lockdown Christmas.... Students come home... r rate explodes go lockdown 3 early January.

Students like people hate Boris torys, go tiktok see videos 10's students house parties adhering magical rule 6, hell people work 30's meet every Saturday football there's 15 one house. 

Younger people / students tend mostly shop/bar/restaurant jobs. Think tesco / coops, alot younger people working senior managers, let's say 10 staff young obey lockdown / masks socialising obvious they'll easily spread older colleagues bring friend / social circles. going keep happening unfortunately majority bracket adhere / follow rules.

I mean students anyone 16/17 early 30's I'd say tends flout rules groups. Fuck fear mongering tried, people stubborn, do? I've reliably informed lockdowns bad. primary method controlling spread virus. lockdowns one consequence must never, ever belittle, making poor people awful lot poorer. thought reliably informed this. Pretty much every shop I’ve sign saying wear mask. Scotland right enough. party people times pandemic might actually feel like discriminated minority. Remember feeling, still important pandemic gone. kids probably aren’t missing much - Scandinavia pushed hard laptops (chromebooks) digital learning aid, we’re finding kids learn best via analogue methods.

Ask “non-digital schools” massively popular Silicon Valley, amongst millionaire tech workers afford choose education world kids. highly subjective point view. think would correct say US needs infringe human rights want pandemic brought control.

That happen though, they're screwed. think matters charge. many dumbasses bottom post begging r/DarwinAwards Awkward merit badge.  father pub awaiting word. much less populated much less geographically dense, know, apples oranges that. assholes saying Arizona casedemic? *slow clap* stupid. That's one reason taught French. decent number descendants French-colonial Midwesterners around, go way research early history Midwest, goes way back 1600s earliest French settlers here, unreal think about, mainly little sign history left.

From read, Native Americans often St. Louis. Americans kicked took over, believe least one allied tribes slaughtered wiped Osage. weird way, handful white people descend French stranded Midwest might descendants extinct tribes. thats cause western countries refuse make public treatment protocol early stages vs asian countries everyone knows it. thats one thing many many deaths? Spain Belgium would beg disagree Everything's bigger Texas. It’s population stupidity test anything context stupid conspiracy theories, ""UN"" ""globalist"" often codetalk dogwhistling ""the Jews.""

 like ""the rich powerful"". NSW +1 Ya, people live absurd places overpriced relative spots guess what, that’s also lot actually work, comfortable conditions, family, lives. People often budget better can’t budget actual cost living are. 

More importantly, millions people moving somewhere cheaper tomorrow. good thing think covid spread rural areas flooded. Following theory India 1.500m people awesome. China 1.300m less 100k cases fucking boss... I've lived three years I've ever seen. couple hundred total?!   know kids want dress visit, shocked level non-adulting going on. across street work hospital, throw huge party. Idk, feel alone living like sometimes. likely complete scam. give dime proven independent verification trusted third party. “You don’t know either”.

Yes, do. Idiotic pretend it’s impossible Foresee danger that’s exactly we’re talking avoiding measures.

This “not bad” rhetoric needs silenced slap. even bring cases zero, point areas outbreak outbreak occur area needs lockdown stop spread rest non-infected country carries normalcy cases/deaths. would probably take bit 2 weeks, would require testing contract tracing areas prepared right now. Cummings works Russian mob, mob owns Leaver Tories. Boris fire Cummings Boris one making big decisions.

This information missing. Google ""Semyon Mogilevich"" want learn more.  point even super enforced measures don’t make virus go away already said. I'm glad America one lots dumb people. 3 days ago 4 new cases , 2 days ago 3 new cases, recommended NSW's health 1.5 meter distance cant maintained mask must worn high risk areas like taxis supermarkets shopping centres etc 

NSW Health's tweet 3 hours ago 

"" NSW Health calling people south west Sydney, number recent cases community, come forward testing. people receive test results within 24 hours.

Wear mask lot called pundits doesn’t represent necessary annoying measure global pandemics it’s symbol moral fortitude. Virtue signalling worst. incomplete list. Hopefully time get full count honour dead appropriately.

For I'd like add Anniz Ebrahim, Director Care Salvation Army Meighan Manor. We're literally worst. absolute worst. There's denying numbers. Yea I’m likely quitting job Monday we’ve positives (found 15 minutes ago) probably going try force positive home. PPE obviously isn’t sufficient we’ve 10+ staff get sick show symptoms past week. vaccine mainstream, guess not.

What's point? sick everyone else too? Why? hate tell coming. severe brain fog, headache, extreme fatigue, loss taste smell nasty parting gift mini stroke. Luckily stroke symptoms gone day. working people can't, want to, companies allow to. agree! Yeah.....not time soon unfortunately.

We locked border hard. Even australians struggling return home. Hospitals crowded patients lying floor large public areas become field hospitals. actually useful. False positive roof.  Socially acceptable: hope.

Required: kidding me, people get rid masks soon get vaccine, hell lot people arent even wearing masks now. they're stuffed now. really restriction empty threat. God wish could live New Zealand. It’s countries much better us, besides Asia Oceania  want move Australia. yeah aunt took vit without K leg bone crashed weight alone mean there’s spot column column b. right lockdown (like super significant) would probably work. It’s 2 weeks, probably even Melbourne’s 8 weeks. 

It’s possible slow things enough really trace, quarantine eradicate, practicality every state holding 2-3 months limiting outside entry that, that’s stops working. think one nicest things someone post pandemic feel sick (flu whatever) put mask on. thinking someone made masks said ""I cold"" it, people around would see ""look person trying protect us"" ""this person thinks dirty"". 

Let thing first Stop blaming individuals failure leadership.

This moral fortitude issue.

This public health issue. ""Your best bet vaccine fortunate enough Trump charge.""

HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA funny.

""If democrats still locked regulations rather final stage trials. ""
I seriously doubt - would happening FDA getting pressured release necessary testing completed. bad vaccine bad worse vaccine.

""Hopefully Trump get re-elected Biden charge probably see another 6 months.""
Trump utmost ignore Coronavirus even exists. Jesus. mom lost April 1st still hasnt got back yet. Well yes, probably wait month see stay 0 fully sure Maybe states pick team names mascots, might help us get winter feel like playing competitive tribal game! can’t slap “to fair” front something expect people realize vastly different things comparing. disagree you. right thing sub perpetuate politization corona. time, particular election basically whether believe science.

I wrong egg on. dowmvoted this. Elect con man, get con job.

The guy spends entire life lying mark, deflecting downplaying problems.  treats constituents treated casino investors: suckers lied fleeced. 90% accuracy 60 seconds. Pretty good. Exactly. 

Not mention masks pain ass keep track of. Sure I'll wear one public health crisis longer. miss able go events without track mask. 

Why would anyone wear mask public longer absolutely too. Enforcement cattle prods! total number infected important, complicated.

In theory, 100% lockdown, numbers would near 0 2 weeks. Since every infected person would spread it. Now, 100% lockdown possible, would take longer, important know, even short lockdowns turn numbers around.

The total number factors play 100% isolation possible. yeah thanks reading early treatments china/japan/korea march 0 death friends/family covid Man totally disagree. militant family wearing masks help us COVID, shit dies couple years so, hope never wear one Interjecting here. School isn’t childcare babysitting me.

Lockdown that. worked hard YEARS get happy leave school, spent year trying help slowly gain independence he’s 10 capable going park without (his needs don’t present barrier - hate term he’s high functioning) needs gentle push. We’ve regressed hugely him, lockdown perfect world. never wants go anyway etc. never wants see people. NEEDS stuff school can’t provide. He’s academically gifted (cliche maths genius) it’s social stuff life stuff experiences learning around people etc needs school for.

Basically... know said *most* truly actual barriers home schooling. I’m working. I’m definitely sending benefit drop go home cry day feel I’m torn health mental health needs. level high risk placed directly odds children actual need. NEED physical school. I’m autistic dont socialise much anyway wasn’t even hard home, aside growing worry impacts them. 

Oh say wholly believe schools need close control outbreaks. think lockdown isn’t going enough Schools close. know, know, schools caused go has. Clearly children schools transmit virus first thought given we’re tracking like 4x rates worst case scenario projections. Schools culprit schools close.

But do, don’t yet feel strong enough impact kids isolation Mum lungs don’t work well. send them... it’s never childcare. It’s them. risk 90 families worth germs coming home day (3 separate classes 30) that’s huge risk me.

Oh someone reply telling pull them. refer back reasons mentioned still sending them. europe boasted USA couldn’t contain virus like them? health care sector wearing years. common Asia, sure people continue wearing things ever get back kind normalcy vaccines etc... wanted correct edited deleted comment

First day internet mate? Well, least eliminated pandemic response capabilities place!  I've noticed people test positive say idea got b/c none friends they've done everything right. ask friends tested, either know they've tested tested. ask gone anywhere past 2 weeks they've bars, resturants, parties, weddings states, etc. ask people social distancing wearing masks, answer no. course know got it, they've made contact hundreds people incubation infectious periods. live city pretty well masks social distancing. know going take hits economy control virus america screams ""MUH FEEEDUM"" builds dozens strains tens millions infected. permanent reservoir virus, entitled asshole tourists travel world, spreading covid-19a thru covid-19z variants everywhere. understand right? need encouragement, importantly economic political pressure force us dumbasses get control. 

If takes travel bans, trade embargos, sanctions rest world, might thing force politicians right thing. Keir Starmer said back October... whole lot-a-hurtin' goin' dropped /s tested cases doesnt mean absolutely community spread. 

Still requires vigilance yes, might ok. Look, point trick treat. point people give pass certain high-risk activities condemn others personal prejudice. double standard. Yeeeehaw. freaking amazing jealous. Even half now... wish.

But didn’t take guys 2 weeks get first wave localized second one. even close close counts small fraction US Europe has.

So ya, also wish done things right early would least come coordinated plan tomorrow since 2 week timeline OP, that’s going it, all. narrative also stop. 90% accuracy. worst useless. 3 months:

500,000. Let 500k sink in! Hot au pairs cool too. Wonder guy looks dress wig? months become couple years long simply cant keep social people locked lash out. seeing everywhere. call people selfish, assholes, whatever, fact humans want human things. Socializing inherently human thing super important mental health. Getting hug, kissing someone, laughing friend, always meaningful person. personal experience socializing via skype zoom shitty lag terrible impossible conversation beyond small talk. lucky husband child get talk every day, many normally surround friends, family, live alone literally completely alone. bit empathy others situation instead making snap judgment folks actively trying kill grandma. Perhaps dark place simply NEED people. 400 person halloween party obvs smart all, bet people attending expecting 400 people, many people desperate social interaction. Lockdown Tokyo Drift couple countries share island... Sorry. mentioned I’m Sydney. 1 every thousand people see mask.

Saw maybe one today walking around Westfield 5 hours. know anymore. thought 200k worse case scenario, figured point even greedy would bite bullet what's right 

Now idk. think anyone cases want, unless imported Yeah they've outdone places spring summer winter season they've bought lot time. Mine TN close that. small town less. 60 Cases? workers alone. possible blowout know Tuesday remember electoral votes popular vote wins election. I'm lost confused believe well. mom still breathing issues early april. Early 60s ran marathon last year great shape. know virus firsthand even didnt kill.

Every medical person know going hell April nightmares seeing one concerned anymore. Virtually hospitalizations hospitals. get comes lil cases rise rapidly feel like point already.

The next month telling obviously. become socially acceptable

👍👍👍👍👍👍👍 governments supposed manage public commons, poor behavior introduction infectious disease harm economic environment many.

You falsely speak there's trade-off. There's none. Contain virus properly, good economy. US 50 dysfunctional leaders 50 different things federal government powerless much due something called constitution. stuff Trump charge ok, like PPE ventilator production, supplying hospital boats, fast tracking vaccine development shutting borders early. would argue handled better democrat president would, given Obama/Biden botched h1n1 allowed 60 million infected. deaths spikes linked local government incompetence, rather federal. Cuomo example responsible tens thousands deaths aged care decisions. US style government worse dealing global pandemic cases we're pretty evenly spread across Victoria state lockdown. ye pretty much this. regardless much virus spreading point still rarely leave apartment wear n95 do. could still get unlucky point people gonna they're gonna call someone else ignorant coming across ignorant. course Vitamin metabolized used immune cells.

He's saying disease causes deficiency rather saying deficiency promotes severity disease.

Vitamin D, along T-cells, vaccines, HCQ - pie sky dreaming people think there's ""bargaining"" way pandemic require change lifestyle. swing cat hit someone got it,”

Well crap, masks, gloves, goggles, face shield, need cat. good job, becoming part it, thats sure. november, promised vaccine making illegal fuck girlfriend/boyfriend time? Weeks ago. impressively Texas running 9,000,000 less tests. understand said primal instinct thing highly doubt ladies wanna sex strangers babies cuz clock ticking Yes. No, think thesis USA exceptionally bad results Us-focused attitude Americans tend have. USA definitely bad job, world. Nothing exceptional. Yeah...naahh! Aussies may late movies, we've seen Mrs Doubtfire. tell us. p.s. ionophore used HCQ..
 
I wonder result use different ionophore.. JHU positivity rates aren’t always accurate, denominator may off. I’ve seen conflicting reports true percentage won’t make claim here, check yourself. 

There positive rate either way still high, count Ya, zero issues wearing mask I’m around others course something else see people looking righteous every step this. makes funny masks distancing disappear front door. called pandemic unemployment. 100% connected lockdowns.  like forgivable loans business wanted one. 

1. Idk know expect government?  Testing free widely available 75% pandemic. measures taken America almost identical world. I'm sure country democratically elected leaders fighting virus successfully. people maybe better finically Germany Norway system set times like this. stopping virus spreading. I'm sure contract tracing played major role increases. amount money would cost us labor resources track every person came contact infected person vacation. 200 person wedding, 5,000 people protest. 
2. Yup, nothing anyone it. Bro agree you. Everyone wants pessimist. vaccines prevent symptoms absolutely significant enough begin return normalcy. Trumps idiot.

7 dead Taiwan.

235,000 Trumps america. convenient one pulled ass, probably. Wreck’em tech equivalent

Disregarding points contrast make absurd comparison require kind equivalence. Classic example: law forbids poor rich alike sleep bridges. 

What compels person trick treat instead protesting makes absurd comparison. 

Also, one protest used justify every single breach CDC mitigation policy hard imagine breaches policy combined present risk one event whatever reason, show much evidence significantly increasing spread. Thank you. googling still wasn’t quite sure. ELI5 would really help. Sounds like autoimmune disease.....yay! COVID-19: 99% survival rate lowest

I don’t avoid sun either 🤷‍♀️ masks “new normal” Spanish flu? know could even possible. make sense all. I'm happy give title worst pandemic response-2020. I'd rather happen us improving getting rid it, ""technically worst ever"", take get guess. Uh workers fast food places enclosed places ventilation... everything you, know? working restaurants extreme risk catching covid spreading it. mention people work jobs young tend go parties stuff. Also, everyone cook fucking home 2 weeks. gym hand safe important. Source worked many restaurants, thing social distancing live north enough, won’t much good mid-September mid-March. Doctors New England recommending vitamin supplements months. That’s usually test sample twice though. odds better, yes. Melbourne, Australia verge freedom, besides masks social distancing, fun!

If get it’s bad. It’s great but, shit happens. Easy say though, I’ve working 10-14 hours day whole time. 

A fuckwits fuck though. Thank you. Even worse. Hehehe. could something........ would love see happen get there, really need policies encourage people go in.

IMO make sense discuss based preconcived ideas instead absolute numbers bit digging: 87% US households internet access would assume percent households school age kids internet access higher pretty sure even higher Germany live yet schools open remain open announced recent soft lockdown. 

I would say kids could learn home. can't still allowed participate vastly thinned school classes provided free internet access government. I’m saying shouldn’t wear mask whenever want, I’m saying shouldn’t something feel comfortable with, way people medication shouldn’t get comfortable taking it. long term goal typically able need things, finding appropriate coping mechanisms deal life. 

When COVID over, hiding face behind mask become indication person behind unwelcoming others. Though may intention, think people anxiety generally need expose therapy really want overcome illness. Meaning really wanted better, would partake activities make uncomfortable become normal.

That’s two cents. Canada I'm seeing 95% usage masks. know western community screwing people like gets leeway. Add anti lockdown, unbelievers, etc....Probably these, things really different geopolitically. talking selfish people think science. deprogrammed personally affected, whether get sick, die, loved one get sick and/or die. literally fucking asinine statement.

That outbreak extinguished months ago, days, heads City Hall, situation far nebulous. virus spread town.

“You swing cat hit someone got it,” said Mr. TenHaken, reschedule meetings Zoom past week assistant tested positive virus.

As coronavirus soars across country, charting single-day record 99,155 new cases Friday surpassing nine million cases nationwide, tracing path pandemic United States longer simply challenging. become nearly impossible.

Gone days Americans could easily understand virus tracking rising case numbers back discrete sources — crowded factory, troubled nursing home, rowdy bar. Now, many cases, many places, many people coming frightening conclusion: idea virus spreading.

“It’s kind everywhere,” said Crystal Watson, senior scholar Center Health Security Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School Public Health, estimated tracing coronavirus cases becomes difficult virus spreads 10 cases per 100,000 people.

In hardest-hit spots United States, virus spreading 10 20 times rate, even health officials given trying figure giving virus whom.

There periods earlier pandemic infections spread beyond large, well-understood clusters prisons, business meetings dinner parties, tearing communities ways nearly impossible keep track of. part, experience isolated hard-hit places like New York City spring portions Sun Belt summer.

This time, diffuse, chaotic spread happening many places once. Infections rising 41 states, country recording average 79,000 new cases day, Americans say feel left lonely detective work.

“I careful,” said Denny Taylor, 45, said taken exacting precautions — wearing mask, getting groceries delivered — became first family among co-workers test positive virus. Lying hospital bed Omaha past week, said still idea caught it.

Uncovering path transmission person person, known contact tracing, seen key tool containing spread coronavirus. Within day two testing positive, residents many communities expect get phone call trained contact tracer, conducts detailed interview beginning painstaking process tracking new person may exposed.

“We pretty successful proud case numbers went down,” said Dr. Sehyo Yune, supervised team contact tracers Massachusetts spring. one several strategies helped tamp earlier outbreaks places like Massachusetts, New York Washington, D.C.

But cases skyrocket many states, many health officials conceded interviewing patients dutifully calling contact enough slow outbreak. “Contact tracing going save us,” said Dr. Ogechika Alozie, chief medical officer Del Sol Medical Center El Paso, hospitalizations county soared 400 percent officials issued new order residents stay home.

The problem, course, failing fully track virus makes much harder get sense virus flourishing, get ahead new outbreaks. area spins control, trying trace back chain transmission feel like scooping cupfuls water flood.

In places, overwhelmed health officials abandoned pretense keeping up.

In North Dakota, state officials announced could longer one-on-one conversations everyone may exposed. Aside situations involving schools health care facilities, people test positive advised notify contacts, leaving residents largely follow trail outbreak.

In Philadelphia, cases recently spiked 300 per day, city officials acknowledged must leave cases untracked. people, said, catching virus family friends.

“We weren’t supposed get point,” said Dr. Arnold S. Monto, professor epidemiology University Michigan, said process tracking cases notifying people may exposed gold standard disease prevention impractical certain level infection.

“If five clusters going time,” said, “it’s hard say came from.”

When first major outbreak hit Grand Forks, N.D., April, problem clear: 150 employees wind turbine blade factory infected. factory shut doors several weeks, public health officials tested contact traced case.

For rest summer, Grand Forks, college town 56,000 border Minnesota, saw almost new infections. uptick August quickly tied students University North Dakota largely contained.

Now, though, sense control vanished. Active cases Covid-19 quadrupled since beginning October 912 Grand Forks County, half people contacted health department say sure became infected.

“People realizing get anywhere,” said Kailee Leingang, 21-year-old nursing student also works state contact tracer Grand Forks. Even Ms. Leingang fallen ill, along several colleagues. traces case parents, first started showing symptoms. Beyond that, trail goes cold.

In earlier, quieter periods pandemic, virus spread degree certainty. hardest-hit cities, people could ask common question — “Where get it?” — often find tangible answers.

A popular college bar East Lansing, Mich., Harper’s Restaurant Brewpub, became hot spot summer dozens people piled bar, drinking, dancing crowding close together. least 192 people — 146 people bar 46 people ties bar — infected. Afterward, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer shut indoor dining bars parts state.

In Ingham County, includes much East Lansing, far harder tell virus spreading now. county’s 4,700 reported cases course pandemic, 2,700 come since beginning September.

Much new spread may tied students Michigan State University, students living campus taking classes online. every day, employers residents call Health Department report random cases defy easy explanation.

The public whole short memory. over, desire among public move past pandemic soon possible. people like wearing too. going wear mask forever avoid every little non Covid germ virus. 

There's also fact country whole really care health. Look high deaths USA. developed nation comes close.

USA #1  That's true many fucking examples around world need show doesn’t fucking work? Europe locked down. Didn’t fucking work.

And point New Zealand Australia, please remember fucking islands.

Numbers rising month. People kept ignoring dismissing that. Hey I’ve seen one before! think meant New Zealand. U.S. can, chose to. Rich poor, examples. article posted sub day we've already lost last 1,500 nurses, number died WW2. doctors nurses dying, they're quitting profession entirely due burnout trauma. Many people saying worked 9/11, hurricane Katrina, etc., covid worse. coming decades, nearly every western country face doctor nursing shortage, staffing experience, means higher health costs, less care, worse outcomes. may even see generational decrease life expectancy, reduced capability handle another pandemic happen. Friend's brother got UK. Lost sense smell taste even he's recovered. He's hoping they'll come back, apparently chicken tastes somewhat like vodka now.

America dangerous. media make many guys guns. election goes without hitch, remember unexpected peaceful ending bad year. kind like cold.

A test, track trace system needs working also, along massive investment support businesses employees.

This pandemic going put massive dent nations budgets, support people should. 

We come side point cpuntires spent eye watering amount money trying support people(where can) economy. read, people favour approach, wonder many people supportive taxes go pay all.

Atm anti mask protests, protests restriction civil liberties... assume countries protests tax increases countries going impose ro pay debt incurred trying support said people.

It's currently mess....only going get worse gets better. Texas population: 29 mil

Positive dementia. Masks aren’t accepted middle century pandemic 

No become norm literal sense, late: Republicans suddenly start believing hoax. Republican leadership suddenly start taking pandemic seriously encourage followers believe existence virus. Americans suddenly stop demanding want right now, instant, accept sacrificing frivolous needs (remember luggage *Spaceballs*?) today good everyone tomorrow .

Realistically, late. Maybe everyone tied beds true, doesn’t mean federal govt needed bury head sand hope went away... like sane admin would worked states come plan - literally opposite like stopping usps sending everyone masks, stealing ppe tweeting “liberating” states.

That's absurd way look it. 99% places failed contain virus. living fantasy land think blaming China initial virus response would changed anything. They've warned pandemic coming exotic animal trade wet markets decade. attempts mitigate it. Absolutely nothing.

So blame countries got borders? thing containable, contained easily every country China got shit together, right? last checked, everywhere. Everywhere contributed spread. Almost country taken care shit. unless Taiwan, New Zealand, Vietnam, country zero new daily cases, criticisms China worth fuck all. part stop covid communities, go away. 

Of course going debate point, trying pin blame China global pandemic. Every country world contributing zoonotic diseases, worst one far. petitioning government stop urban sprawl? reduce reliance factory farming? stop deforestation? helping world create sustainable living solutions? 

No? 

Then shut fuck up, contributing jack shit pandemic prevention. Yeah, wet markets caused this, delusional think pandemic problem caused China China alone. 

Take personal responsibility, fuckhead. even NY bailing small businesses. It’s fucking gross. Exactly, infection rate end first three weeks lockdown would improve right would call virus defeated. Better Biden. hell wrote this? headline says United Kingdom lockdown, article says Britain lockdown.
It's neither: England.

I’m glad fucker knows he’s doing. 

Poor UK fighting US who’s got harmful government. reason. understand intent, careful words now, much misinformation flying around. money never connected directly lockdowns, been. way buffet drastic effects economy result demand shocks pandemic (and still needed purpose). reason two pronged: 

1) United States government levels fallen short direct measures contain virus (testing capacity, tracing, public awareness/outreach efforts, lockdowns necessary); ironically countries attacking virus successfully using measures techniques developed *in US* achieve successes, people heads far asses can't admit different every country, even countries use methods came with-- digress 

2) People America selfish, closed minded people, generally less concerned neighbors/communities instagram feeds question might exempt wearing whatever reason, meaning can't really police people want wear :/ I'm sure heard FBI clearly says ""antifa chip,"" maybe they've gotten already. all, I’d show evidence it’s censored :). don’t want know fall break yet. guess seems strange (for example) attended monday, got tested Tuesday, got positive result fri (when got call) considered infectious period kid probably sick day before? Idk. Could right call, strange way word it. case counts exactly same? hospitalizations exactly same? kids knock doors kids senior citizens involved? area situation right much worse case count hospitalization count protest periods

you also say ""as long kids wear masks"" evidence kids will? parents fighting tooth nail rounding corner remember? mention country accidentally eliminated virus, meaning Victoria would locked travelling rest states unless got control. actually didn’t much choice. ""foo-foo"" mean comment? would normally assume ""fancy,"" raw milk particularly fancy, something mostly drunk farmers. alright, I'm sorry things tough you. take couple let's imagine moment people could decide rights nation based purely social perception, infected area like Victoria able declare citizens right travel Queensland low suggestion correct Prime Minister could walk tomorrow start declaring freedom movement popular making order open state borders, would failure democracy.

So unpick it, would imagine Victoria would perfectly within ""right"" declare citizens free travel Queensland, would perfectly within Prime Minister's ""right"" declare also. likewise would within state Queensland's ""right"" declare cannot enter.

I think civility reasons course better governments get together coordinate, ultimately unless everyone's aligned major announcements made. result disagreement would either two things;

- Recognising Victorian travelling QLD would stopped QLD entering, Victoria Federal Govt (whoever jurisdiction) prevent Victorian boarding plane Melbourne

- states / fed could maintain disagreement Vic / Feds could allow people board planes add pressure QLD. Sadly basically what's happening WA least ""hard border"", people allowed fly WA without permit including NZers part travel bubble. There's intention NSW PM stop happening.

FWIW personally Victorian think ""right"" community determine rules upheld. know much pressure put QLD, WA, anywhere else open borders. end day seems like politics raw self interest. iteral counting like 1, 2, 3 infrastructure get bunch tests masses getting results back timely/accurate manner. South Dakota Best Dakota Exactly, US use money prop stock market 1% harmed financially. Thank god saved 1 % financial ruin though! Victoria also quite literally nanny state probably depends kids actually attended particular day. fall break recently kids vacation anything, call might correct.

that said, trust schools right thing right I'm going give lowest estimate 1.15 average rate - would give us 108k 7 day average week 14th Novemver.

Here's hoping I'm wrong counts, I'm curious. Remind 15 days. fucking tell them! Yeah, lucky enough able get testing 2015 2017 different doctors insurances, parents say insurance plan cover it. hit miss. two tests found deficient. supplementing little bit D, think enough. get amounts skin easily makes seems one would take amounts possibly toxic synthetic D. stick sunlight myself. mostly media trying divide state. Victorians support lockdown, aside minority Q-Anon crazies. … except protection people around you. country doesn’t exist. Fun fact! 
Vitamin aids calcium absorption began added milk US. (Rickets prevention) Americans learn thing two China based locked down. Unfortunately US get tons anti-maskers ruin everyone. might argue mandate, think Ron would wear mask without mandate. may hate government involved people's lives, still cares people enough protect them. Lots good data there, thanks!

Also one thing stood several counties (SD, Ga, Va) 0.5-0.7% entire population die COVID. That’s twice high NYC even would even know request it? know traveling. Especially car. would need stand organization cross check flights, license plates, tolls, verify people went, went home to. Business travel exempt anyway point. also exempt whole tri-state area. described really happening UK, I've seen anyway. Apparently we're also slacking iodine front. added amounts seem enough. Crikes. Like would expect situation could still possibly get worse Spring, would also expect slow burn 15 20 30% whatever got infected would still provide significant slowing buffer. Doubling rate 7 days bad I've seen current surge measures place days (even loosely applied, slowly complied ònes). That's maths. 0.1% 100,000 100. No, countries dropped ball. However China dropping forced countries even deal it.

They've warned pandemic coming exotic animal trade wet markets decade. attempts mitigate it. Absolutely nothing. what's fucking point? data suggests standing corpses 230k dead people likely infected morons like yourself.

Enjoy! reads like trump tweet I'm fan LNP federal government decisively seal borders pretty early pandemic, really main lever pull states run public health systems. Well sound fun. agree it’s still happening. That’s little extreme tbh. Oh fucking god happened. woman fired epidemiologist. enter data dashboard.  fired lying crying media. job simply enter data verified actual epidemiologists scientists. mistakenly entered data verified yet. Instead owning mistake cried media created problem exist led well deserved firing.  hope right even slower :) funny get used even attached protective equipment. 

I love white water kayaking. basically wear full gear whenever step boat. Special shoes, neoprene suit, sort skirt, special jacket, ""swimming vest"", helmet. 

The suit really annoying. stinks, feels weird, sometimes pinches certain parts. jacket really annoying. made almost plastic bag material. really uncomfortable feeling, especially put on. also pinches neck. swimming vest really annoying. really tight limits movability bit. Also gives much volume. helmet really annoying. never quite sits perfectly, straps chafe chin. skirt thing really annoying. can't see feet always way. Also: everything always wet. cold. Worst all, cold wet put on. 

Don't know caught it, getup really annoying. uncomfortable. 

But somehow, week so, get really used feel naked unprotected without it. Especially vest (which assume works bit like autistic cow press machine). 

Of course, done pleasure, really comparable something will, shows get used anything. wear mask day (in house, cooking watching Netflix whatever) sooner later begin ignore might even begin miss it.

Controlling virus means unfortunately seriously rethink indoor stuff. economy never recover. Cause I'm going inside anywhere get vaccine shit over. I'm sure millions feel way.  I'd assume folks stopped really caring started living virus. 

Doesn't help asinine amount Americans who've considered hoax entire time, ""you can't take freedoms"" anti-maskers fucking everything too. right should, tbh need get exams first.

Expect riots. Easter! /s death rate comparisons Covid 19 flu?

Do hospitilzation rate comparisons also?

Do post virus complications too?

Of course don't. another totally blinkered guy sharing debunked, useless talking points see obese unhealthy 20+ cigarette day cousin shrugged like nothing.

Honestly absolutely embarrassingly clueless. people I've met believe religion more. use crutch assholes. I'm original person responding pretty common months ago. lot supporting articles. stupid even then. much evidence childhood spread several reasons, kids work school, far fewer interactions, tested nearly often due getting seriously. instead seeing deciding evidence, people saw decided kids spreading spread it.

Let sink in. numbers low also started isolate contacts contacts, outbreak 100’s might isolated instead whole city/state. guys really deserved getting control year already had..keep safe aren’t aware situation Australian states/territories you? Australian population density general really?

Australia’s third largest state Queensland. 2.5 million it’s 5.1 million inhabitants live Brisbane. Take account 2nd highest % non capital cities dwellers state/territory. Another 1 million people also live surrounding area (aka South East Queensland rest aren’t exactly spread evenly either. haven’t locally acquired case 41 days. 52 since community transmission occurred (ie cases already isolation). Hey, that's good know. pro Plague. motto body choice, like pro abortion crowd, know? Universities hand... 
 
Here Leeds we've got two universities, huge outbreaks across students they've living packed Halls parties. 
 
I'm keeping schools open, Universities moving almost everything online sending kids home (not Halls). many people refuse flu vaccine even current flu season clinics hospitals rotate at. We’ll see many people willing take COVID-19 vaccine... Would helped take first sign symptoms. cure covid, help. Pretty pathetic live time looked upon support president.

So people watching 24hr news channels would see flounder scrutiny. never going back outside. Yes no, late save passed, still mitigate spread. That's Texas mostly comprised idiots opposite needs done contain virus.

The risk dying virus otherwise seems like pretty good incentive. Certainly UK seems like they're aiming delaying action, reports they've already looking get deliveries vaccines starting go hospital within week anticipation super accelerated emergency approval vaccine vulnerable healthcare workers phase 3 trial data released.

It's ridiculous say could well vaccinating vulnerable people 4 week lockdown finished Lets see happens open lad. Lone Star number 1 Australia record low flu numbers people wearing masks, social distancing, keeping safe.

It's hard everyone. Sorry touch 401k Amateur sport leisure closed though Came this, thanks! I’m sorry you’ve through, mindset “people seriously can’t handle months isolation?” you’re exhibiting pretty common among good amount pro-lockdown people I’ve seen turns people away idea lockdown. 

People need realize different people different thresholds, different personalities, different situations could make social distancing harder easier lot time don’t think people realize that. 

Like, guy you’re responding perfect example. He’s saying lost major job prospects debt increased right pay you’re saying he’s whining. That’s “wahh don’t get go clubbing weekend wahh”, serious tangible effects life wouldn’t happened wasn’t this. 

Have compassion. Ironically lot pro-lockdown people don’t show it. research studies done that. Scientists asking hospitals research impact covid. 'Nationwide lockdown'. fancy name restrictions. None enforced, main hubs spread still around probably nothing. Maybe watch lived China visited hospitals, couple friends doctors. Australia 1.4 billion people extreme weather conditions like do. Either way, I'm grateful Australia UK US, I'm positive would okay China. China needed take measures, it! Like sending 42000 best medics country help Wuhan. tells Wuhan indeed worst hit city China, cities came close. second worst city was...HK. 5 cities cases thousands. Many us thought China looks like 90s, improved dramatically including medical field. Look 3 hospitals built, ordinary buildings clustered together, negative-pressured hospitals. also created negative-pressured ambulances. seen country this, China. That's China capable building today, sounds unbelievable manage pandemic. certainly can't that, way would able manage city hit 60,000 cases without national support. something happens occassionally. move passengers aisle, put blanket them, maybe glasses, body removed everyone else.

Also, blankets washed reused flights. agree. leave holes unpatched dam, eventually water holes flood everything. Either properly ventilate mask kids close schools. Exposure sun reduced, greatly, recent centuries. people spend lot time indoors wear clothing, especially winter.

For last several decades, US, told use sunscreen whenever go outdoors, prevent skin cancer.  reason be. rest world weara masks sick. study says good covid treatment 3 theories variations experienced perception amount time passed, ' fast/slow time moves'.

One theory says brains perception time varies based number new experiences. 

 Kid summer, two months off, summer seems forever, long time. high school , older age- boom, blink two months gone.
Every- more- experiences new kid, summers seem forever. 
More experiences new less experienced brain, new experiences= slower time perception.

You ( lot us year ) normal amount 'new' experiences....slowed time ( perception) down. Welp day work got worst wholesaler open businesses public shoppers still find ways get gunna empty shelf's WE'RE NUMBER ONE!!!! redditors lol Get ready long tail. sweden two thirds deaths came peak. peak already double ours. top 10 over. fault he's horrible president deserves get bashed 🤷🏻‍♀️ Pickpocketing almost unheard Australia. Though almost every Australian story getting pickpocketed Europe. We're probably easy targets. Probably main reason. agree needs tested third party obviously don’t know Singapore think “most likely complete scam” asked fact check narratives pushing. took less 10 minutes cell phone. 

Did it?

don’t like ~~the facts~~ racists far-right religious fanstics mean? That’s right. essential. see ludicrous display last night? Fantastic. I’d bit worried device disease vector, disposable mouthpiece not. face gets close it. Locations price range extremely rare location. We’d looking 2 years 1 14 companies seriously interested space study (and previous smaller one) say good treatment covid They're actually required enforce it, police fine anyone see shop without mask shop responsibility ensure customers wearing masks. Would good system police actually went shops this, naturally I've never seen police officer shop...

At least Scotland compliance well excess 95% maybe need 20 25 EUR pandemic Germany, bit (maybe 50 EUR?).

Still enough once-a-week grocery shopping though. wait minute. saying want us put water crops.  Looks like, surprise, FDA actually refused rushing vaccine. country reported something also case group 32 people asymptomatic. Agreed, one well known brands U.K. EU though name carries weight quality double worst peak Sweden spring. basically population us. predicted 10k new years. adjust 15k minimum. joke, relax. made comment made everytime China reports zero cases. Anyone stands make even fraction penny existence care you. Empathy compatible capitalism. could admitted wrong say Australia ""small isolated island"".... no, can't possible that! die virus absolutely capability maintain control yet **nothings changed** fact

I've work since March, blown savings, dipped 401k make rent feed myself, government forced employer close providing adequate money live. millions people position, lucky ones compared people going crippling debt.

But right, nothing changed. comment unnecessary. evidence vitamin helping respiratory disease, havent seen cancer. place shop, storage workspace money paying things separately. Made sense bring one roof.  swab test also give false negative early on.  says adding vitamin helps. outside rallies like protest rallies? completely forgetting cases asymptomatic, meaning method would find **more** temp checks alone allow us contact trace much effectively. Yes that's right, majority would Chinese national still relatively difficult foreigners get visa moment.

They tested, also placed centrally managed quarantine 14 days. That's catch 22! obviously genius ubdefeatable impossible humans understand mask solution that's deficient UK standards probably optimal levels. Barnard Castle exempt time? Asking friend felt France, Macron said : Lockdown, work, study... feel like mom saying : ""Privé de sortie"" (grounded, fun outside anymore) 👁 wouldn’t even call naughty. job get ridiculed employees gotten written using sick leave allowed yeah. honestly covid situation isn’t much better. can’t miss pending test nowhere test Monday clock Monday test  Exactly like fictional setup like implies wars auto immune disease body already anyway. may digestive issue absorption. Vitamin sprays available cost bit more. vitamin absorbed blood via mouth lining. always looked upon support \*impeached\* president.

And following logic question, would condone US President culling weak? kind greatness that? make you? Congrats. team, similar fashion fucking (your adjective above) fascists, gotten posts removed. unable respond. typical. like facts, censor them. NZ funnily enough US closed international borders. went dentist good learning virus (when shut down). much so, invested new equipment. husband went 2 times glad pit needs route canal asap. go anywhere else except important appointments. ok probably numerous measures place like calling arrive etc. Oh, one thing husband read study gargle listerine went (which always anyway lol). well~  It’s pretty clear. People dropping guard. lying friends careful they’ve been. giving up. Pasty lunch-item, Head State. Yup, fucking right! We're good path. Daily cases decreasing. Number deaths go temporarily since lag behind case numbers eventually follow trend cases.

Seems restrictions worked even go full lockdown. Movie theaters 100% open Colorado. department know spouting hubristic crap.  Yeah look tests Texas Yell UK really start thinking Boris really conservative Moderate germphobia, sure, seeing droplets aerosol someone speaks would define unhealthy. That's really good question. also curious searching answer. know different tests now, one saliva test. would guess nasal one collects greatest amount virus results accurate, understand exactly tests run lab. article thought interesting tests work, detailed really answer question. Yeah basically got Ireland last ten days. Shops closed, schools work open? 6 weeks compliance good far kids require someone stay home them? you, supports everyone? think families afford parent stay home teach kids? single parents?

I've worked healthcare professional treating post covid-19 patients entire duration pandemic home health setting. get witness virtual learning parents, particularly low income parents. know want believe bunch selfish Karens mostly families scraping single income they're lucky. Single parents SOL. 

Keep schools open allow spooked parents socially isolate kids years end. ever arrives) 

Spoiler: complete running list every location I’ve since June 8th case need speak contact tracers. get information phone, it’s easy access I’m extremely sick, easier. awful. Can't get money back?

What sickens really wedding insurers actually cover cancellations due act government. Absolute fucking joke me. basically, wedding gets completely cancelled COVID restrictions, fucked. Thankfully, position yet, however get married 3rd, pay registrar fees get another notice marriage, come £600. see can't extend kind thing, fault happening. Hospitals capacity Texas... all. curve Austin quite flat: mainly flaring west rural areas right now. place poorly Texas El Paso.

Land area Australia: 7.69 million square km NiiiiiiiHaw.

PS. Hello Wuhan. Sounds like good time. frats throwing parties weekend, friends went house house. 

You salty want, people going get back normal lives eventually. time goes on, less people care 'social distancing'. Humans social creatures almost year, time give break. guys think US another lockdown? compare current stats well overall stats. New York NJ got hit early knew nothing virus made bad decisions paid price. point, Texas knows everything still keeps wrong thing. point even though less deaths, leadership looks worse. sort small private park people have. Minimal foot traffic 3AM  Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand, Mongolia, Japan. Explain away those. still completely missing point hilariously faked numbers be.

Provinces reporting hundreds cases single digit sometimes even 0 deaths many them. said many times before, cases found beginning testing woefully inadequate.

So means province reported 800 cases, likely many, many cases found. means thousands cases...0 people died? 2 people died?

I know lived PRC even visited, hospitals would expect developed country (which makes sense since PRC still developing). Sure, many hospitals first tier cities snuff, count number first tier cities one hand. PRC big country.

Taken together--thousands cases semi-modern health care system--and fatality rate well flu (we're talking 0-0.2%) see numbers pretty obviously jive rest world's. Clearly Weekend Bernie's fan... fuckwit get back stamping reports pants shitting rather telling states do. 

We succeeding spite him, him. trolling, one stupid. government paid us stay home. mean want wear mask time this, power you. I’m saying don’t think norm most, would bad thing was.

As sick time, I’m strong believer mental health days. silly, must hacking lung call thinking many places have. Either skilled migration program qualifications experience area Australia shortage of.

Or marry Australian. They'll keep saying coming soon never actually come lol. Nope. Actually pandemic stopped dead cold tracks, time, relatively quickly say 2 months tops even less, people willing commit necessary. rocket science, basic biological science. opinion shared racists. went tonight I'm ashamed it. good time friends. I'm going shamed anti-social. Yeah, office job part critical national infrastructure systems cannot transferred laptops security reasons, can't work home.

I also 100 people wedding, going 15 people socially distanced, party afterwards. So, yes, understand difference thanks. conversation relative infection rates, Belgium near 7x much. 

Also pedant, it’s logistical exponential Considering people dragging feet matter main reason still to, choice accept that's we're going putting awhile longer. They're really useful line work, like things like going parties eating friends, nice masks go back needed curb plague instead mainly used keep dust pollen out. can't understand whole ""schools closed we're putting teachers risk!!"" argument. Millions essential workers working throughout pandemic one advocates them. life grocery store manager working 70 hour work weeks worth somehow less teacher? teachers special? Americans minds. UK Cummings official got caught traveling around something like that? Bodies.. always something. Hope well! :) Doctor: I'm sorry positive Covid. *But wait there's more!* Yes. Yes, do. think anti-social, 30 million doses going high-risk people would effectively cut death rate half Fitting maybe lower expectations, suggestion. 

people free want Sam's Club people wear masks? Even regular Wal-Marts.  went local Sam's Club California first time days ago, seen least 15+ maskless people there. Sorry you’re downvoted pointing (accurately) Americans pathologically selfish. like think kind tolerant “best” clearly don’t qualms giving disease someone else get good insta moment Victoria pretty small area Australian standards, size Minnesota.

Victorian cases 1 per 295 people. US cases running 1 per 36. Soros’s checks really helping 
:^) i'm northern european descent wore mask sick public past years serious flu followed bacterial pneumonia put ER. want risk sharing Mom can't get vaccinated flu pneumonia allergic reactions. realized meant could give strangers might able vaccinated. want unknowingly make someone seriously ill knew could reduce risk wearing mask. would get stared at, people double takes little kids tell mom scary.

I really hope least portion America mask ill future go knowing spread whatever even much less likely kill covid19 cuz never know long spread. oculd always keep going reached someone could seriously injure kill. putting wearing scrap cloth worht like driving speed limit, using turn signles etc.

Turns influenze spread asymptomatically antibodiy surveys showing anyting 1/3 3/4 tested antiboides without recalling stymptoms illness. excuse imo practice basic decency mask least buidlings public. Well remember, it’s protest agree with, every single one 150k people wearing masks it’s impossible contributed spread mention 250,000 people died COVID Trump 7 months vs 12,000 H1N1 Obama 12 months? Well proportionally assumption figures accurate yeah sure. India China could complete shit show population sizes allows widespread coverage.

All figures rounded but..,

US 9m cases 330m population approx 2.7%

If India % it’d 38m infected, China would similar. Well, European Union population 446 million people consistently 250,000 new confirmed cases per day last weeks. Per capita, that's twice many new cases per day compared US. Right beating Sikhs wearing turban. think best option would social distancing mask wearing mandatory vaccine, perhaps 2 week national lockdown help hospitals bit (or atleast localised lockdowns hospitals struggling)""

So basically states then? think anywhere close reaching hospital capacity. Antibody: must defeat covid invaders, even means destroying homeland!!!

You: wait second... post pointing live feed want headline internet. 
 
Lol people wonder one takes /r/coronavirus seriously news, one five people also found lack common sense. break. agree spend now. see fix debt mess. like stocks national debt goes up. curve flat? they're overseas they're working Australia thus taxed. kid haa friend frequently goes Aggie games. family covid already second scare month later. kid house long time.....if ever  Vote! exactly want know? Canada similar position us population spread coast coast much better us. I'm buying excuses.

If national plan rather 50 plans actually legit lockdowns, we'd much better position right now. We're cusp lockdowns anyways. We’ve seen US — less open, people go outside. Several national parks big increases last year I’m sure winter slow it, things won’t quiet, especially stays warmer.

Of course, we’re going crowd anywhere, outdoors people getting activity...  Given rampant spread that's occurring right now, ""a week two"" pretty spot on. Yep masks mandatory Victoria probably lifted coming weeks. 112 “hard” lockdown good public health team, media federal government everything could make fail, state federal government different parties. public broadly supported though compliance pretty good, vocal minority opposed complained entire time saying wouldn’t possible, would destroy economy, suicides would rise etc - none true. True. Yeah im wondering someone would die plane wouldnt commotion passengers moment spread around plane Melburnian right, reason could (and to) virus eliminated rest country already. two choices isolated rest country ages, put whole nation risk second waves, harsh lockdowns go elimination. hard months, thank god it. Dan Andrews legend, Scott Morrison go get fucked.

There's part America that's position something sort. Even one states wanted go it, successul, they'd isolate rest country months, that's feasible. think best option would social distancing mask wearing mandatory vaccine, perhaps 2 week national lockdown help hospitals bit (or atleast localised lockdowns hospitals struggling)  vaccine going magically fix everything. virus stay people want move lives. all. 94% cases metropolitan Melbourne inside Melbourne metro vast majority north/west later outer south east. large swathes Melbourne metro area zero low numbers throughout second wave. someone remind competition highest number cause seems like missed obvious memo reasonable predictions vaccine available late March April, gonna 6 months anyways.

Also Trump said vaccine would ready late October. ain't seen anything.

Democrats Republicans also control vaccine trials. Peopledie planes time.

To hide covid requires government completely corrupted coopted men evil intent. They’ll still vote red ballot sympathies extremely limited. happens covid flu try hijack cell? Would higher risk mutation? Extreme harsh lockdowns extended periods time place biggest outbreak biggest factor. Also extra financial support incentives stay home get tested, effective contact tracing places lower amounts cases. also name Propagandhi album. 

But fitting song what's happening US,

Contact tracing almost worthless moderate worse community spread virus, partially reason - virus reaches certain prevalence area, literally everywhere around everyone almost chance figuring particular segment cases came from. would say areas country, many many months since anyone could actually trace significant proportion local cases back one particular event location. still see odd report ""X event caused 112 cases"" ""Y business linked 50 local covid infections"" that's it, always mere drop bucket. Like we'll see news story yoga studio got linked 30 covid cases past month, meanwhile county reported like 8k cases. fighting brushfire squirt gun point. First all, curve going back hospitals going past capacity soon.

Second, still social wearing masks social distancing (which none people doing).

Third, people need social distance like 5 months vaccine out. really hard people wait little longer. Especially since people preaching social media staying home beginning pandemic. key states allow processing early votes Election Day, like PA. much angry government’s failure provide competent contract tracing effective infection control guidelines.

Sucks seeing family friends, least I'll alive unaffected covid-19. talking about? criticised children. There's obviously got balance. think pretty much everything outside probably OK (for adults children) since basically tiny amount cases actually proven infected outdoors compared indoors.

“They’re trying kill people need socialize“.

Are capable connecting dots here? 

Its they’re trying do, they’re actually doing: inadvertently killing people. 

Therefore shouldn’t it. 

It’s funny mental deficiency guys have. even aware it? 

You place priority need socialize, effects so. Killing people. don’t even realize that? Yes. soon possible. Preventative, proactive actions could dramatically halted spread virus would fact helped airlines economy whole medium long term. 
Short term greed always come back bite long. Maybe consider fucking would rather see mass death across world. Fucking COVID-Lover. People like think smart confident. But, mindset comment responded demonstrates total lack comprehension goal lockdown (even though it’s stated repeatedly Boris).

There need significant deterrent breaking covid rules though. Relying vaccine wishful thinking, ignorance unfortunately massive minority keep lockdowns coming. 

Have contact trace everywhere, instead getting poor shop staff enforce rules, submit details breaking rules gov bill juicy fine. 
The rules shouldn’t need ‘enforcing’ anyway. We’re adults here, handle it. can’t? Make wish had. 

Make illegal operating pubs venues organised parties criminal offence beyond fine, lets see many continue callous rules. Australia small island, largest continental island planet. Nearly population lives large urban cities (Melbourne city around population 4.9 million). 

The reason could never work US requires sort agreement leaders actually something. Rather raving anti-science lunatic turned masks political allegiance symbol. 

You suffering serious hubris rather conceding point keep digging hole. Youre making stuff up, draconian lockdown elderly.

NZer, think would manage, starting point dismal. Well done. Small businesses destroyer however it, ways unsustainable tough. I'm Melbourne Australia, we're coming long, hard lockdown. 

But feels good zero cases / zero deaths. 

I went drive country first time many, many months. enjoyable seeing 5km house. 

I suppose I'm saying direct experience hard, ultimately (in opinion) worth it. Small businesses destroyer however it, ways unsustainable not. look things know electron microscopes. Also, actually taking care kids pretty important pandemic. big reason schools stayed open children Sweden otherwise parents would take care them, many doctors, nurses essential personnel children, able work unless schools stayed open. Putting rough? may stupid realize exactly against.  Agreed. lockdown NZ Autumn. \*way\* better winter. outside garden allowed short walk home way agreeable temperatures strongly positive. me, odd point view. far deaths per capita, number European countries similar loss life. wholeheartedly agree US handled pandemic poorly, say deserved millions people take seriously bad take.

I’ve messaged people don’t seem give rats ass. I’m genuinely concerned, people know posted scolding messages people stay home blissfully walking streets, going bars party’s. actual fuck going on. Austrian ""hard"" lockdown even softer German ""lockdown light"" start tomorrow. Sometimes media likes amp things reason whatsoever be. lockdown remove restrictions, end exactly set events triggered lockdown. inevitable. second waves continuation first wave never really contained. Fantasy coronavirus football? cut ties parents around four years ago two decades subjected neglect, physical emotional abuse. Every morning first lockdown first thing thought ""I'm glad I'm house this"" Compassion still matters, even live COVID world. people lack doesn’t mean others don’t well don’t understand people going through. 

It also depends facts consider important. fact covid killed large amount people fact matters you, fine, increasing amount people that’s fact matters. It’s also fact restrictions killed hundreds thousands jobs, increased substance use, increased suicidal ideation, shut universities across globe. less less people putting “tough shit” mentality unfortunately have.

In one fell swoop Cummings proved wrong Thanks one good ones. never really realised lucky went overseas army saw others life. might occasionally whinge something, shut fuck up, life good. point, we're catching majority. Fuck up, you?

Every bar, restaurant, coffee shop retail store closed.

How equivelant lockdown they're open?

Most people (or enough) follow advice otherwise rate infection go (which won't) go crawl back hole. leaders brag defeated virus Czech PM back August talking Czech Republics success. He's PM overturned health ministers decision require masks September. [Situation Czechia also ""Farewell Covid"" bridge party beginning summer.

And health minister resigned, replacement job 6 weeks forced resign photographed maskless walking restaurant days closing requiring masks everywhere even outdoor.

But sure, guys keep clinging fantasy. British folk getting vitamin D? Really?

A lot Republicans 'religious'. I'd say pretty primed Branch Covidians staying home seeing anyone again. 

Who asking that? believe run like shit reason call centres play 10 minutes crap even hear option. they’re hoping you’ll give stop caring. don’t care happens aslong outcome getting wanted. Nope, new rule restrictive basic tier 3. tier 3, rule apart fact meet 6 people, rather one:

""You may continue see friends family live (or formed support bubble with) groups 6 less certain outdoor public spaces, as:

parks, beaches, countryside, forests
public gardens (whether pay enter them), allotments
outdoor sports courts facilities, playgrounds""

The wording confusing though, also says following:

""You must also meet people outside household support bubble private garden outdoor public venues.""

My comment able meet walk may liberal editorialising somewhat, though guess demonstrates confusing rules are. you’ve said it’s clear you’re allowed work. strongly endorse use 'cockwomble' actual thing. find lots flight attendants stories talking too. Yes, except goodwill nation gone. lived fucking yurt third world country two years. freeze winter, wake three times night put coal fire. I'm feeling fatigue. harder anything there. tell I've never experienced hard day life. Yeah, 100% think that's better

And where's covid killing millions? pass 1m 8 months? People dropping dead streets lol thanks! part? Victoria eased restrictions. Shops opened. 0 new cases three days week.

Still 25km restriction place restrictions visits.

If trend continues though, things much closer normal Christmas. personally think valuing compassion way highly, personally rate factually correct morally right higher. 

It sucks everyone, welcome trash future. Texas country, it’s state. England country thousand years, laws parliament. don’t think it’s country doesn’t mean isn’t. kiss connecting flight pandemic. Californian, feel sorry you, Texas, way compete No. 1 state country. Glasses? starting sound like bad comedy movie... president. chance guys better get moron house get someone cares money Even bloody apology would helped Thing is, people pick spread leave. aiding spread COVID rallys. people potentially infecting others leave. Eventually someone vulnerable catch due someone attended event like that. 

Furthermore, people unlikely die still potentially serious consequences covid. might sound lame, thought block living rest years without ability smell taste (or worse yet smelling/tasting bad things time) huge reason take precautions hopefully get vaccine first. See /r/covid19positive stories people symptoms post infection. [Number Asia even coronavirus masks standard among many street food stalls That’s deflecting argument. I’m talking anti-lockdown people. 

Im saying lot pro-lockdown people talk lack compassion anti-lockdown people ironically showing lack compassion towards people aren’t taking mental toll restrictions well - it’s big deal you, shouldn’t big deal people, disregarding many effects people - losing jobs/businesses result trouble keeping families afloat, worrying children mental health possible social developmental impairments, able see loved ones. 

This mindset “I’m suffering don’t act like are” isn’t compassionate way see it, turns people away. people really need work perspective-taking skills. Yeah bloody legends did! Absolutely proud everyone else!

Australia thanks :) Exactly, *i * knew would happen warned family heard scheme. PM crew couldn’t foresee this?? Obviously could chose short lived economical benefits. lost think lost. Regardless people do, there's lot, mean fucking lot personally mitigate spread. thank you! also, first lockdown trapped kids pretty fucked situations.

Not kids stay home playing Xbox online learning. some, school safe space. that's get way disadvantages kids tough situations comes education.


Now, lockdown half term? can't tell you...... make sure immune system less likely react like that? Someone know schoolbus driver. kid test positive bus Monday show Tuesday notified Friday. department health cared kid sat next even though kid stop road bus entire week. driver found someone else never notified called Doh said unlikely they'll get none people bus need quarantine. Unless you’re black brown. don’t absorb vitamin shit. work lot outside vitamin levels trash. Bojo large majority, he'd need incredible push back get wants parliament.  What? realise means Australia long borders stay closed sort ""normality"". good thing, even without vaccine. Reddit certainly place pedantic, Sir. That's get stop testing, people! (Mandatory /s fend downvotes) country full smooth brained dip shits listen science? might. Best estimates days seem IFR .2-.4%, includes early data treatments poor. It’s far exact science, it’s science have. just... get it.

I'm desperately curious know Cummings Tories, clear reason he's got immunity portrayed vital Greetings Mexico. 
The situation it’s kind complicated, 60% working class country doesn’t legal work, employers don’t want pay taxes self employed, part people need daily cash flow survive. Also, lot people don’t want wear mask doesn’t want wear properly believe lot fake news, like “they controlling minds infrared thermometers” “they killing sane people hospitals doctors extract fluid knees sell it”. 

Right suppose Halloween’s parties banned (at least state) doesn’t care neighbors, holding one using cheap shitty noisy Chinese speaker, call police, might never come.

So, misinformation poverty killing people Mexico.

So symptomatic people specific enough, work assymptomatic people either. Good luck raising serum vitamin levels all, anywhere north Oklahoma time year, via Sun. daily positive test 2.500 interesting experiment, 10x times found half population, maybe every country like 20 times official numbers every day. here, difference lose gym times week. guys try nuking it? supposed work fur hurricans according POTUS, amirite? Better overreact underreact case chief. would understand public office, good thing not. Whats laughable callous attitude towards vast number countrymen dead.

Sheer number dead, absolutely first. Current plan end lockdown start december. worst might end start school Xmas holidays. “Bars, restaurants shop windows ransacked central Turin, tear gas fired Milan police attempted control violent demonstrators, police cars surrounded iron bar-wielding protesters Naples beat hasty retreat.”

Nothing says anti-lockdown like destroying places you’re mad able go to. island size continental USA. can’t make numbers know... 20% long term effects.

Probably much ask. herd immunity. get twice it’s worse second time. observable fact it. dont know, like classical PCR test, result within 15 minutes argument making wasn’t meant imply protesting pandemic won’t spread disease go anything large groups without worrying transmission that’s clearly case. 

The BLM protests wore masks that’s one key reasons covid didn’t spread significantly even though thought would. apply Halloween. 

It’s now, kids wearing masks, I’m sure wasn’t hard considering it’s Halloween, shouldn’t saying kids shouldn’t trick-or-treating covid transmission thousands people protesting masks covid wasn’t spreading. true. Proportionally similar. Except Aussie median wealth shitload higher median USA wealth (and median wealth relevant average wealth). hasn’t US done this? Evil always incompetent. It’s arrogance comes makes case. massive benefit then, less taking vitamin D
 
how both? like ""China lied!"" slogan, never changing 'Its Hoax!' game plan. put stick? Lol Prior COVID, every doctor planet would roll eyes assertion Vitamin C, Zinc, Vitamin could help, prevent, reduce severity flu similar viruses. doctors narrowminded refuse think outside box. 

It’s really interesting watch 3 supplements take center stage Covid. 

Hopefully medical community lot open minded future rest us known decades. wonder reflect future cases 10 times daily increase. experts disagree lockdowns. doesn’t solve anything making poor people poorer. Isn’t record I'll must keep job money coming in. don’t close schools it’s criminal yepp, antigen tests antibody test.. US actually much higher GDP per capita Australia. 

No, much higher. $62K vs $57K USD.

However Australia leaps ahead (we rate second world median wealth) comparing median wealth ($411K vs $97K). Median wealth essentially chops small number gazillionairs USA.

That's they're lucky enough work job paid sick leave. lot people calling sick=not getting paid, that's going option people. said, deserve bad leadership. 

Because quarter million american lives die.

Only US amongst developed nations, population death rates acceptable.

In modern country, would revolt. Aberdeen. people see complaining wearing masks online. HAHAHA I've made redundant past two week process ... Went £30 £45 UK safe say lost fight this? power anything. least fight states trying do. saying hoax. nothing worry disappear month. attack country country need anything states sort out. Etc. I'm sure basis calling scam (because sounds impossible *you*?), authorities Singapore certainly think so. They're planning roll public use soon, they're betting technology like allow borders reopen inbound travelers economy depends it. proof pudding eating. total deaths pandemic much higher. I'm actually appealing emotion all. I'm deadly serious. think months months seeing death toll rise going severe impact mental health nation? truly would. germany 14.000 weekend numbers, half country send numbers.... Yeah look, know enough government go usual amount surety venom, Hope listen scientists guys go hard lockdown like should, look Victoria Australia, sacrifice. must wife’s Birthday. Tesco load cheap pasta seasonal aisle, reduced clear summer autumn... Whether want work irrelevant. work still two weeks. paid government stay home, able afford food family. really, still wants keep schools open, biggest spread virus. Kids powerhouse spreading germs, might get symptoms pass older people super easily.

It’s funny education one thing mostly done remotely. Yet reason kids must school little social distancing... China disagrees... wasnt BBC breakfast day saying Lockdown 2.0 stupid idea lol currently tier 3 restrictions... going down, problem solved! doesn’t appear attempt improve situation either. “But HE’s it!”-mentality isn’t really helping anyone  politely asked wear shops restaurants sat table. apparently fines wear public transport think police could issue fines. since pandemic first got real Iran, back February think. lockdowns, 2 week New Year's break everything closed down. Aside that, lockdowns. Except, schools online pools closed. Aside that, everything else open. People give shit anymore, mask-wearing dropping, numbers seriously ridiculously high (especially death rates) whole fucking mess... mention already live shit, getting real tiring putting shit every corner! mate comment sounds insane. People breathed three decades it’s fine. Yea, brain damage worries me. Texans smartest begin with... Problem is, false positives pretty significant impacts many healthy people's lives theoretical lives saved. Orrrrr mom’s basement  makes sense, children spread germs like rest us relevant someone attractive aren’t looking date them? provided support people done.

Yes. right goverment even agree give us another $1,200 stimulus check. 

The American people need buckle prepare high death rate. Mostly can't shut biz give people support. Right without help, lockdowns option. government offering help. obvious going give us help anytime soon. going lot deaths time January hits. First let say I'm sure chose ignore everything said kind change timeline use stats facts earlier covid pandemic. may trying argue I'm hearing peoples opinions, going say I'm wrong right one way rant. I'm interested. 

1 South korea? see cultures compare all.  claim America better stopping spread Germany. questioned statement measures taken drastically different ours. Yeah 6 months ago testing dismal, I'm arguing that. said 3 months ago. know USA awful, I'm saying different. I'm claiming contract tracing testing useless. I'm saying people going follow guidelines, testing tracing going stop spread alone. know think contract tracing testing important wearing mask social distancing. Please explain me? get std test anytime want, mean wear condom. Please tell Government resorbable spread people follow recommendations.. 

2. person refuses wear mask. makes think care get tested? get tested makes think isolate? would assume person refuses protect others might covid change act know it. talking people put mask face use cover chin. mean thats kinda mi plan thanksgiving. 5-6 people 400, but, I'll stocked groceries, leaving two weeks after. treadmill inside too. caregiver(s) work though? report comments. rules sub state remain civil Fuck off. “Even pandemic passed”

So writer article knows future? one knows end pandemic ever pass. America lockdown. obvious government refusing help people. Without UBI expect people agree lockdown. understand COVID serious. also understand friends willing lose everything lockdowns. choice government individual? 

Right state, bars open. blame bartenders. need money. government offering help. expect do? Go shake money tree backyard? people bar making choice go there. blame McDonald's someone gets fat. Ouch, got feelings hurt huh Maskless Torys hang crazy 30 year olds Dad lost mom last year he's dating around. always says ""ooh social distancing."" even know women he's dating personally. He's meeting online idea social circles run in, whether they've contact anyone it. swear get he's blame literally go nowhere apart single friends place. Yeah thankfully get rabies. never got bit friend scratch. come can't leave? Huh? living home briefly splitting girlfriend march 70+ year old parents getting worried i’m key worker knows could bring home, find “temporary” housing. housing turned couch 50 miles away worked meaning commute 2.5 hours day working nights. still day. http://www.nhc.gov.cn/jkj/s3577/202009/318683cbfaee4191aee29cd774b19d8d.shtml
Hope helps.

Kashgar *is* locked iirc. cases lock probably makes less sense mass testing many ways. example, mass testing Qingdao's whole population costs fraction daily GDP. the..?! rude think Rupert Murdock problem, much like US. know government cares state live in? Golf like safest sport play right lol Right? Wear mask, walk night, whatever. anyone think we’ll see widespread lockdowns US? numbers justify enough public support? Seems like status quo headed somewhere awful nothing changes upcoming deaths exist going happen would happened start spread further? 

Dumbest fucking justification thread. Ok get difference UK England explain Britain bit? mean... there’s literally super spreader events happening over. think seeing people mental health doesn’t go shit fine. .02% ND caught COVID today. catch No, covid, regular lung infection. 2018. covid, even worse probably able put someone covid treatment autoimmune disease. favorite calling buddies ""wanker"" prolly even spelling let alone saying right Yeah went 6 houses. people tables set candy individual baggies would sit lawn chairs front porches 20 feet away. pvc pipe set they’d slide candy pipe trick treaters. Seemed pretty low risk. It’s parties that’ll cause spikes tho, bunch little kids walking around outside. IIRC, Last saturday 80k last sunday 63k. sure else ask this- dangerous visit dentist? problem aware extremely annoying exactly threatening. would much like get taken care asap case numbers doubled I'll remain maskless visit scared. sure best course action rabies... ""small"" paid everyone, they'd $2 Trillion debt instead $1T!!! Yes also take countrywide trip go Commons, *after* testing positive virus! Exactly! actually find extremely comforting see entire staff wearing masks properly. Dairy Queen KFC city though...well seeing half employees covering nose mask....I going back time soon. lockdowns option.

They option without UBI. right force people poverty. force lose everything. Recreation? modern school also relatively recent invention, critical essential thing children can't go year two without they're doomed. Backed second dumb cunt realised McGowan Labor Poli time approval rating 98%. Ok, let’s ignore percentages sec. US, we’re 230k dead Americans past 8 months, continues rate means 345k/year. often would say flu reaches levels (even discounting additional efforts taken year)? look cases per capita /s Another problem happened Germany families coordinated one parent taking care multiple kids, taking playground etc. end bad school. El Paso second time. Texas huge. areas impacted. high minority, low income population like El Paso people suffering. telling demographics go home. die. 

That said, Austin's numbers never made sense look literally entire rest state. Yeah - according stats, infections Primary school age children gone 9x since start September (the lowest age group). Secondary school kids seen go 50x (the highest age group)

Why classrooms mask free beyond That’s good hear! (The compliance mean) feels like everyone’s sick point? 

Hard imagine effect before, gotta stay hopeful. That's GOP. Trump done thing without heads party circling around making work him. return got slam incompetent unworthy judges federal judiciary cement ideology without question. full lockdown anyway imo. Lung infection covid? Economic short-sightedness strikes again. dont coughes do...what clickbait article... sound like nazi 1940s. scared? people brag partying global pandemic? Wow that’s great! Lockdowns seem really upset lot people here. also lot people can’t afford stay home $1200 got didn’t much. really thought US Would come together pull through, it’s far gone. People angry told do, even told, givin recommendations stay safe “infringes rights”. suppose maybe large country work together get this, especially election next week, people angry. Thanks sharing! know 90% 180 tests done accurate, whether 10% false positives negatives. ""negative Nancy"" wanting people potentially get false negative results return normal lives spreading virus? point comes back unless managed eliminate one country (a small isolated country spread population like 4m) managed do.  look phrase ""order magnitude"" means. america probably ends horrifically dystopian thing back people minorities detained disproportionately hellish prison system Ah, thinking SK, point ""You'll tired winning"" - Trump, 2016

Say will, he's man word. landmass 1/12th population. weakens argument how? Me

This passage, Luke 11:23, Jesus explaining division lead collapse. accused driving demons name Beelzebub, aka Satan points Kingdoms divided survive. passage reminder “lukewarm” Christian. person barely participating participates goes commits acts conflict word. passage way call arms lay foundation divide people, make clear evil good compatible. 

Let everyone subject governing authorities, authority except God established

An excerpt study Bible: “The civil rulers, probably pagans time Paul writing. Christians may tempted submit claim allegiance Christ. established God. Even possibility persecuting state shake Paul’s conviction civil government ordained God.” 

This reinforced Jesus states taxes Romans. giving said tax done worldly concern give God God. reminder Christians concerned workings government political movements. 

How Governments rulers allowed exist would best justified simple truth humans live linear view time quite unable grasp even one simple variable impacts future events. 

I feel like conversation could go back forth quite time, assure tested faith great many times since conversion 10 years ago without faltering. time raised atheist long time despised hated Christians would stand opinion. Reading scripture would use book point fallacy riddled texts. wasn’t actually started dig deeper study realized beauty simplicity faith many bastardizing. 

Simply put Christianity religion nothing anyone bring table God. acts Christian done compulsion avoid punishment, rather acts done heart changed option perform tasks. change realization love drive evils world nothing else. exceptions group person worthy love. people holding signs “God Hates (insert group person)” spreading false statements. statements oxymoron God send people hell hate, rather acceptance free will, given gift, allows reject offering Iove acceptance. Many theologians purpose God makes last plea upon death done persons Jesus. topic take us rabbit hole pretty soon we’ll talking Apocryphal texts. I’ll end one simplest verse 1 John 4:8 “Whoever love know God, God love.” Peace you. husband nurse works hospital. exposed two COVID+ coworkers tiny lunchroom found gossip. ball dropped place. told could get tested one hospital's urgent care centers. got opening told 51 people front him. 4 hours later told 18 people front him. left. 8.5 hours arrived got call saying turn. ended getting tested one drive-thru health department sites. rapid testing yet though wait 3 4 days results. bullshit Trump's lies easy get tested bullshit. Even frontline worker difficult. break you, viruses always potential induce autoimmune disorders. Easter! sure Easter definitely Easter. Polls open since Friday, mail ins available weeks now. telling people wait til 3rd? Get fuck now, nothing anyone important right now! 0 community cases whole Australia today! !remindme 2 weeks Well Honestly, think Tony blunt enough. know prides non-partisan different administrations there's ever time take stand call pos Trump is...now would it. Govt payment support people lock without job. Harsh lockdown rules, along fines following them. Lots mask wearing. Compulsory checkin using apps notepads shops contact tracing needed. General respect situation business tjeir best battle try support staff community. Everybody hated protesting minimal. main thing govt paid people businesses lock flat rate keep starving. Cost us alot good position cause it. Exactly. Testing sites overwhelmed refusing test people symptoms, even close contact someone infected. 

My mother tested positive last week, refused test father he's symptoms, even though sleeping bed her. needed talk testing him, needed know work. tested positive.  holiday gatherings coming up. I’ve already politely declined family Thanksgiving invite. included note coming high risk please don’t come you’re sick. Ffs. Fuck comment! I’m republican, hate trump, wear mask, wash hands, part. Fuck political thing, that’s bullshit, you’re playing Trump Biden’s stupid ass campaigns. One stupidly anti mask, one acting like mask permanently glued face. You’re dumb ass simpleton truly believe Democrats part republicans superspreaders. Pull head ass... still go back lockdown zero stimulus.  living pain fear days tbh. live outside US, country virus relatively controlled better back home mom sister healthcare workers Pacific NW.

We dreading winter. ""All see respiratory droplet plumes aerosols swirling around air"" moderate expression germophobia.

Realistically, germs going happen, exposure good necessary immune system. Obsessing going accomplish much benefit, deleterious one's mental health. personally go PB since thing started since would non essential things, hard time picturing tanktop UFC ""tribal"" tattoo guys backwards trucker hats huge trucks wearing masks, seems brand loudly complain rights. Yeah, bad breath. like ‘lockdown virus control ease restrictions slowly put surely’ Boomers Plus even good mask use still relies people people, well, we’re perfect. Heck, even sitting class medical professionals, I’ve watched someone mess mask consistently rush wash after. People.

So we’ve got less perfect tool us wear, plenty people probably wearing wrong (if all), people actively spreading too. It’s 100%.

Which still way better masks. isn’t foolproof. problem lack central authority capable imposing restrictions closing borders shut.

Even Merkel wants eradicate virus, can't order permanently close bothers call citizens home things depend her.

Is exact makes EU unique also makes impossible handle coordinate situation like this. matter good neighbor poor job open border them.

In Summer 40% virus infections happening abroad, people going tourism visiting family abroad. could avoided people allowed travel.

It really frustrates one, left right political spectrum, advocating closing borders implementing managed quarantine arrival. Yup, herd immunity totally way go. /s talking social distancing mask wearing effective?

They effective, super effective. France things rigorously virus spreading like wildfire.

Mega lockdown true effective method. successful countries like China, Australia, etc. used mega lockdown. 6M people got jobkeeper (a quick dirty google). Australia's population 25M. said get money. 

I sure point is. much US thing, food purer countries. No. Anytime someone calls ""cynical"", consider 100% proof valid answer said.

As jobs, Boris announced continuation 80% salary support scheme. even read wrote? love asking Americans know bellend replies either ""yeah, end bell"" certainly big fiery ball sky. UK government advise supplement vitamin winter. issue, per experts comments article,is sometimes even forget take them. makes sense terms habit forming compared took time, learn habit season.

Just put milk already. studies linking vitamin depression. understand food consortium this. Much valid comparison. Picking Belgium base one comparisons different whole Europe picking worst US state compare to. ineffective could possibly be? Even 80% right, finding quarantining people immediately knocks countries virus spreaders circulation natural selection they've already bred. Yeah I'd believe that. found texans really proud state, im sure could it. found texas quite auatralian like bit issue Federal Government something illegal first place?

They providing submissions support lawsuit, backed realised stood good chance costing Western Australia next election. spelt 'freedumb' available, common. Many stores restaurants live pay options available. got card tap pay, still need manually enter PIN pad.  Jesus-people trying help you.


FTFY No, vaccines hit herd immunity gets larger, much less strain hospitals economy open up. Especially trump fires Fauci weds disagree. least summer could finish work go long walk/ run gets dark. saving grace summer.

It’s dark 5:30pm Uk winters aren’t cold, they’re wet. finish work 6pm. vitamin me!

It’s worse women. lot (understandably) don’t feel comfortable running/ walking dark. It’ll death human civilization. I'm anti Conservative think Boris twat agree you. one group happy governments decisions. difficult balancing act mistakes always happen instances. issues think cannot overlooked forgiven additional fuck ups like paying millions ppe, tests track trace system fit purpose. refusing extend food vouchers vulnerable children school holidays. often genetic issue. genetically predisposed autoimmune diseases, may never run trigger. Certain viruses trigger them, stress huge factor.

My ex husband's family full autoimmune diseases. developed RA extremely stressful time lives. daughter got type 1 diabetes age 2, bad uri double ear infection. got symptoms RA right starting college. like watching tennis match honestly. depressing one. case numbers low we're point automatically contacting testing close contacts confirmed case, also close contacts close contacts. Last time new case, 500 people got tested one person. Agreed. Singapore's pcr tests take barely 24 hours come anyway multiple test locations ppl go. u get sent home day wait 24 hours accurate pcr test. 

Currently, standard practice anyone sore throat sent pcr. Previously said masks work. coronavirus? strange symptoms never before.

1. Low grade fever, temperature 37.4 degrees. comes goes.
2. Coughing white phlegm lungs, stopped sticky, nothing like seen before.
3. Pressure head, like skin head shrunk putting pressure head. lessened, never experience before.
4. Loss taste, lost ability smell taste.
5. Shortness breath, hard sleep lying night. less now. want Netherlands....
We're great announce second lockdown Crystal imfused masks $50 Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* solution address demographic similar demographics. reopen schools childcare. What's accuracy said antigen test days? test tends less positive PCR test might test coffin negative, although positive, sensibility might different. leads conclusion least 1%of population positive. Rome... Infect Italians covid19 ? Damn, read communist transmission, hope good there. free report here. happened never have, multiple times. so-called chilling effect longer so-called. world outside thread knows truth. elderly parents actually think left house long.  food thought. seeing effects giving ""total liberty""? I’m tired getting accused moron wanting try enjoy something life. Last lockdown essential worker work whilst seeing family friends, became incredibly depressed. lockdown I’ll considered essential worker still go work. I’m 25 won’t affected I’m still expected work sacrifice good things life older vulnerable people. likelihood people voted brexit Tory government without thinking effect young people. shouldn’t go pub see friends? care old people now? keep making sacrifices people literally vote best interest? many fat slobs eat McDonalds breakfast, lunch dinner dead? Still fine? think point see next two weeks look like. might found lots “missing” infections got sick tomorrow went test next Tuesday next Thursday. course great part approach everyone knows won’t spewing virus around days becoming symptomatic getting tested 

But agree it’s interesting I’m looking forward numbers look like next two weeks Well 1.4m pensioners Slovakia according (whether old ill..). need go take tests. Also count children 10. (could find statistics). also need take part testing. also 130k even people working abroad. left 3.5-4m suitable going take test. certain groups people (for example LSNS voters believe every retarded conspiracy never go take test. ) mention people maths worked car would needed stop least twice petrol journey. Implying getting possibly COVID-infecting petrol station, toilet visits etc. problem NHS able handle everybody requires care. available beds people need fatality rate UK go up. Hah hah hah. thanks, know works. Theoretically, effectivity increases number people living together one household. three members get tested one turns positive, two stay quarantined well, regardless results. Also check elder « survival rate ».. can’t beleive people still denial.. /r/justaflubro recession, made worse violent protests. Autoimmune diseases involve absence particular gene. gene stops immune system turning body. right course demonstrates almost nothing national level (NYC instance strict measures) effective half-assed measures employed Europe less economically damaging. Obviously that's pretty broad brush, going *lot* books written subject next decades. mexico... Abuse police civil liberties violations exactly new thing. I’m Hackney (haven’t ventured much months imagine) yeah, seems like 99% people wearing masks indoors. It’s mandatory streets I’m seeing people wear anyway. also felt same. visited west coast US. northern cali upwards, seemed methy. dairy products substitutes fortified vitamin Sweden.

1 microgram per 100 milliliters products less 3% fat. 20 micrograms per 100 grams stuff like butter margarine. Never understand anyone would drive whole family. thought eyesight might faulty. That's risking wife &amp; childs life possible car accident.

If want test eyesight ***walk*** 20 yards car see read number plate. see wife unwell everyone wants lynched it. Durham police investigated concluded fine handed public need move on. Jeremy Corbyn dinner party 8 guests family people turn blind eye. Crazy selective people choosing condemn behaviour...  north everyone wears masks shops. seen President? That's what's going there. Yeah know. interesting much cases found average much look everywhere worry, war would Christmas. around without mask on? Ya'll mutha fukkas need science. Americans also say masks even pandemic so... Italians brothers freedom loving! Oh agree regard kinda rationalized myself. 

But point doesnt really matter shitty weather is. People going about. 

It doesnt really snow here. 40s rainy bad gets. people likely still it. weird seeing countries go path Australia forced too, can’t learn rest world insurance. pay watch contaclesq 3years people pay phones contacless cards.. isnt case us yet?? What's daily dosage? It’s possible fires helped covid situation - international coverage meant tourists may decided travel bring virus. Hopefully good come them. Also, dont care human rights. makes enforcing lockdown lot easier. find someone life talk to.

And need see person effective. sure. government bunch visa options, academic moment borders shut tight. Even natural-born citizens struggling get moment. Obama fever? worry another article month says exact opposite. Scientists doctors might know what's going on, news media sure shit doesn't. result...neither we. given new cases currently imports, would hesitant open borders much. Ireland went €20 €50 per transaction, covers majority in-person transactions. Came looking this. 

I mean fine make own, better. literally copy pretend made yourself? ain't high school, pandemic. ask reproduce Yet another reason refuse covid test costs. keep saying cases go need lockdown again. Well everything cant avoid getting tested that's cases go up. 

See dummies defeated purpose testing. scared people honest honest, get locked idea could possibly case, reports kids spreading around US places. dying also suffering long-term complications; they're immune, despite politcians would us believe. Depends consider ""passed""

If get widely distributed vaccine longer concern think eradicate it. continue unvaccinated population probably mutates something less deadly. (Then need vaccine know exists easy enough stay ahead like flu) Yep, per capita deaths average [over Wisconsin. people think extremes? 0% chance. Care share live? don’t seem great grasp US think current leadership majority Hah! Yep. Paid unlimited sick leave. Would probably amount voluntary mask wearing. Germany thing, businesses close, like gyms, restaurants bars (who choice offering take thry're able make work), schools kindergartens remain open. Apparently found schools much super spreaders feared would be. Let's wait see how/if works, seeing post Dublin similar measures, certainly could work. Unmitigated, infections multiply 2k 200k times month, least weekly testing necessary keep down.

But current transmission rates, factor 10 per month, maybe month even longer would sufficient, positive people adhere isolation forced so.

It seems like closing bars, preventing parties, wearing masks, using soap, opening windows sometimes test month enough keep economy going.

Once tests available every corner enforced, rest restrictions could stop (maybe sensitive areas like hospitals food production). fuck right survival rate. Check back another year likely figure thing cripples long term idea getting into. feel like enter LOST DECADE event US ancillary effects abdication duties current administration. survival rate fuck off,  metric. What's difference police officers killing want states Mexico ? No. argument know facts. draconian. elderly like prisoners little freedom movement allowed part society.

It harsh. antigen tests high specificity almost useless. Also PCR test 100% many cases people went positive negative positive. think modelled 'what do'. want China (welding in) method, terrified Italy (family members taking pics freezer trucks full bodies), 'fuck that, we'll stay home bit'...then UK 'Geezus mate, need beer toilet paper, go shopping', Govt stepped give us hand stay home hide winter watched shit-show unfold. Then/now...we quietly sob beers lack support many getting US. still minimise outings (electively/collectively?), next big 'thing' Xmas *but* Govt cans Xmas tells us 'stay fuck home' again, will. think different mindset 'freedom'. Sounds fair enough. positives simply isolate? guess would take care false positives stay home government mandate get trouble employers etc. get majority vitamin sun... food. First “you people” racist stupid fuck. Don’t say that. 
Second all. god, Dr. Fauchi, one said 2.2 million would die wo action aka heard immunity strategy. give one reason aren’t using “goal post” assess successful strategy US across board? TBH covid alert app kind flop. hasnt worked well tracing cases low uptake. using ones least likely catch covid. Meaning low number alerts sent creating flase argument pro pandemic people hasnt helped. Leading downloading need herd immunity, lot people possible, take vaccine else may perpetuate greatly mutate. Thanks information! I'm still wiping groceries get delivered, guess carry case? N95 filtration standard. masks specifically talking about? Duckbill masks suck pretty bad disposable dome masks aluminum nose strip fit pretty well. Queenslanders ay! They're almost same. Income same. Total taxation per capita same. Wealth significantly higher Australia made him? endangered people?

People get mad cyclists running red lights time, mean they're going run red lights cars? agree rules first place, breaking wreckless endangers people, 

What's different scenario? small scale contact tracing makes difference. sound like brainwashed. takes US voters 8 years notice. non-coincidence matches length 2 terms president. median age COVID deaths life expectancy. COVID lower death rate seasonal flu young healthy people (aka backbone economy). worth reading.
You seem arguing wins title inept went winning it.
From point view awfully sad see come this, hope worst fears come pass see real leadership. work breach health safety wear gross misconduct. sacked someone coming work knew boyfriend covid. formal investigation. polices followed Exactly. people childish simpletons incapable managing lives destinies. need strong guidance adult leaders keep safe strong. /s Shouldn’t problem countries like sg Something nobody 12 outside Reddit says. We’re island - helps going?  Lol wot type technology would exponentially improve contact tracing. 
If companies/govts (Dutch/Singapore) could work together data share, would move things along faster! Saying “ok so?” Doesn’t change people think. 

I gave insight local pub clientele thinking heading second lockdown south east you’re like “ok, so?” Okay that’s damn situation here. point was: pretty silly scale small region large one, since never outbreak actually behaves large area. Taking small state/country/city (such small european country, individual US state) scaling US population really helping characterize anything.

Also ""most people familiar with""? people where? US? Look way, rest, test much more. Also, it’s much useful country like Singapore, take tests leave. contact covid case, quarantined 2/3 weeks, way around it. test, would streamline testing, making slightly faster testing Yup definitely wearing mask necessary safety others.

More open idea wearing one cold need go public though. 2020, excluding maybe state level lockdowns become increasingly untenable holidays coming politics invaded response.

Potentially new government taking control January, enough deaths, anything possible.

Until then, every household safe least safe person choose associate with. know personal lockdowns privilege everyone has, tool point besides masks. cities already tier 2/3 doubt US leadership, western leadership fact, product people. majority least. Wishing bad things happen bad. everyone sees US nation fails at. Take advice made much difference place.

You would've shit tonne less covid deaths important realistic. That's point science. supposed care want, document nature reality. data shows practically zero risk personally. live elderly people though people risk keep home. Same. tier one Saturday gone. spike hospitality schools opened went south really fucking fast. I’m almost offended considering lockdown almost 9 months straight. didn’t come easily us. actually do. time. Millions people. google official sources. Even dumb said recently. clearly eyesight... privileged/upper-classes greatest trick? weve learned that, actually no, sometimes great plan/strategy. conjurers trick make think there's connections privlage Every chart showed shit hit fan cases started spiking week two September.

But yes let's keep schools open, I'm sure there's way they're factor this. thanks joe rogan 🥳 matter. Intelligent people take vaccine die, others probably survive. seeing UK CONSTANTLY argument Federal Government's legal opinions suddenly changed halfway court case they'd already put weight Attorney General behind it?

That's works. New Zealand’s economy continue normal tourism big part it? 55 likely die Covid-19 murder.


If 65 likely die Covid-19 car accident. Also great testing infrastructure, accessible every time I've gotten tested results usually texted within day. Kind already is, stand watch. Yeah, pretty shit year general I'm hopeful next year million times better. cultural changes (wfh especially) hopefully stick, removing commutes making general quality life many better Wales (results backwards problems among adults socialising, new PHW data suggested schools ""not seeing extensive I've heard parents talking school gate hugging likely transmit kids classroom. No. Covid stay like flu. mutates often vaccinated life. That's happened. article says needed cleared travel back home. Yes, we're finally flattening curve, goal restrictions. sharply decrease infection numbers. guys got 25k positif antigen tests ?

We Luxembourg 20k active cases 600k people living here.

Well total numbers ""only"" 7k active cases health minister said numbers dont reflect reality anymore results wastewater indicates numbers must least 4 times weeks ago lot media reported good testing, us true tested per capita country europe (we nearly tested whole population twice) seemed enough capacities (did nearly 20k tests per day) even test centres overloaded traffic jams km long. still dont lockdown. cold flu need leave house? think would common courtesy wear mask? know cold gonna kill anyone could lay low week. Given choice I'd rather catch cold someone knowingly spreading it. despise Trump much possible, him? Blame NM governor, maybe. NM state follow up.

I would think airline would least forwarded communication CDC woman virus passengers. China sample pooling PCR tests. applicable infection rate low. case infection rate 1% sample pooling possible. know what, I've got idea. know whether political thing not. least Melbourne adopted make wearing quickly mandated. also think see many Asian countries, particularly Japan, Korea China wear masks case ""alright then, it"". There's ""fringe people"" everywhere, small portion population. difference US encouraged culture crooked political system.


I'm glad live country politicians fairly civilised... chicken egg question there. society influence human behavior, human behavior dictated societal norms?

Believing evolution, pretty good idea truth lies. would assume follow positve test PCR, right? would like see financial analysis one Apparently masks reduce feelings individuality.

Alex Jones says it, must true /s think, Cummings wasnt elected. He's MP. He's basically adviser, consultant. members party calling dismissal, people actually voted role public who's views held less regard bloke whos actually government. SD Biosensor test according PM 96% accuracy, true.. know. even using testing mass population would mentioned accuracy lower. ""Throw bin"" conveniently forget Reagan Bush Sr. expressed support open borders 1980 campaign. means whole day without recorded case... thing would like see tested: Viral shedding person unloads groceries belt, cashier touches every item, rings groceries next. would love swab groceries see viral load gets transferred way. cashier's hands touch everything everybody day long. never seen store hands disinfected customer. That's really happen. China uses pooled pcr antigen. planetary biosphere. Try 390 Interesting! i’d say 9 10 shops equipped contactless pads Yeah, feel bad guys, weird (Melbournians) kind arse Australia since every state seemed contain us.

What think worked us fact people part understood nurses doctors deserve put fucking horrors countries deal with. hard pressed find someone got connection medical professional. Germany got mandatory masks strict social distancing, limited gathering travelling ""cases"" continue spike anyway. stop rising unless stop testing asymptomatics like crazy, happen soon. trust fauci, that's personal decision care. keep mask day want, even car home, care neither. people outside healthcare field supposed get access NIOSH rated 95, 99, 100 respirator right now? said longer use lockdowns strategy antiscience sensitivity antigen test 30% remove 30% infected people 2 days. mean 30% spread virus. good result bad let decide. R0 1.4 go bellow 1. 

Based data pilot testing sensitivity least 30%. good way know standing protect economy? Yes, agreed. Everyone access free easy testing matter live. Apart education, schools essentially publicly funded daycare country's workforce. there's big benefit keeping open nightlife. obviously apply universities, seem strange group together schools. mask street, meet someone, go shop, get work etc. reality wearing masks months, it’s become act habit yet like putting coat, remembering wallet car keys..... amount times I’ve realised haven’t picked mask arrive local shop! 

It’s much better cautious under. Wearing mask huge positive effect seasonal allergies. able skip allergy meds wearing mask every time went outside. I'll probably keep wearing allergy season. 80% optimistic, swab 80% accurate test perfect time, pre-symptomatic phase people infectious, accuracy 40%. point post, may unclear, feels like wealthy Western society excellent job keeping alive people ordinarily able survive less freakishly secure bubble (compared risks inherent throughout human history, risks inherent many developing societies today). 

To address thought specifically, right form, suggest humans biologically poised breed many times throughout reproductive years, would still element effective 'selection' taking place life cut short earlier reproductive years despite whether they've produced offspring not.

And I've thoroughly disgusted reducing sentient beings value objects I'll leave off... That's hate people reduce percentage too. There's billions people planet even .01% die that's still fuckton people. brains see decimal point go, oh much. get someone family die sudden .01% chance seems lot higher change mind. Damn idiots. (I'm also saying odds dying .01% number threw there.) also care survival rate the, 15-20% chance?, getting lifelong disability we're sure going go away. going mess ways know yet first time get heart decent clip die screwed heart even know. Can't win argument, shows economics degree. pathetic that. massive problem. frign time religion bro, catholic church practically invented science greatest patrons ages. Turns out: people. They’re worried phenomenon called [summer Basically, kids lose skills summer break, loss much noticeable kids lower income backgrounds higher income backgrounds, *possibly* due higher income families providing access supplementary materials like books (that’s guess, good one). average, summer slide one month’s worth skills ten week break, based tests administered right right break. 

Right now, we’re 8th month “break”. got upper income kids lower income age-peers classroom right now, would gap be? Many upper income kids technology, parental support, supplemental materials least keep skill acquisition current. Whatever else say 3 million kids haven’t seen school since classrooms closed, say aren’t getting parental support needed enforce attendance virtual learning. 

What happens groups kids become adults? Sure, humans adaptive, missing year two school isn’t NBD either. Trying enter high school 6th grade education poor English skills going hard, maybe impossible. comparing, last days everyone talking per capita bullshit triyng look good numberes USA. dont see anyone using per capita bullshit using opposite direction comparing Japan, China, Taiwan, South Korea Singapore small, medium large population scales countries. People need understand even though worldwide crisis wealthy nations starting get toll everyday economy. need work either dying poverty covid blame want I'd definitely take chances. Give Peter Dutton's office $10K become citizen.  One thousand Belgian people died virus. Trump send troops NATO squash violent thugs?



/$ That's funny personalised masks awesome Christmas present reopen Christmas - juicy taxed goods bought - time next lockdown new year infections spike again. He'd COVID-19 ""exaggerated"" back March talk also testing borders last week, I'm sure anything decided yet. West Australia handy border controlled called Nullabor Desert ... Yeah, drawing really creates massive impact own.

*Temporary* economic pain - *can* alleviated - produce major long-term gain.

And getting people habit fear risks changing long-term habits, too, impede recovery.

Saving economy save lives works spend money helping people, rather enriching richest few. Yes plenty, rural areas sending patients cities awhile now. town whole one icu bed instance. really wanted join Coco friends Wrong. pubs, restaurants, cinemas, retail shops, gyms etc closed. 

You go work unless to, job i.e. construction.

You cannot meet anyone outside household indoors one person outdoors.

I agree schools staying open stupid expect Singapore Happy cake day Science proven DONT quarantine healthy. makes poor people poorer. Maybe stop racist 5 min listen experts. Two paracetamol tablets get mild temp control. Temperature testing good check people may know unwell fail safe people deliberately trying rig system. someone temp 38/39 degrees Celsius, takes two Panadol waits twenty minutes, pass test dentist. expected go work essential industry can't work home,

Is really case? I'm confused trying work out.

The wording BBC is: include work cannot done home""

It specify ""essential work"" cannot done home

On gov page wording help contain virus, everyone work effectively home must so. people cannot (for instance people work critical national infrastructure, construction manufacturing) continue travel work/attend workplace. ""

Clearly examples gave seem like essential industries, wording still suggests anyone cannot work effectively home need to.

So work ""non-essential"" industry, cannot done home. I'm genuinely trying work out, something clarify ""essential industry only"" please share? summer lucky hot spots different times (NY, FL, TX, CA, etc.). allowed reallocation medical supplies personnel (traveling nurses). country seeded perfectly mass infection levels multiple cities, rural metropolitan, once. can't readily pull data, I'm fairly certain proven Covid stable spreads even easier cool, dry temperatures (sub 50F). top coming holiday gatherings. suspect pretty dire situations around country Thanksgiving. welcome. family stopped wiping April, leave alone hours, sufficient according 

But makes feel better, not. One thing still recommend high-risk chemotherapy patients handle frozen meat seafood carefully, know 1) virus live many weeks frozen temperatures 2) lot outbreaks meat processing plants 3) last clusters China correlated frozen seafood. would hope achieve making statement? provides zero guidance additional information Americans people use. Seems it’s purpose would appear nightly news channels, posts like one. Like US part country that? need everyone works! son developed type 1 doabetes severe illness 11. trigger (the illness) one piece. need underlying genetics. became obvious nephew also developed type 1. husband's side family rich autoimmune disease, crohn's RA specifically. link genetic mutations crohns type 1. 
This means underlying conditions genetics even really aware can't control diet exercise. Big fan Shapiro nice see mentioned Reddit Yes, that's thing struck started reading subject. seems little agreement levels have. recommended minimum level Netherlands 40; AIUI 30 recently, countries still say 20. researchers say minimum level 50, perhaps even 60. brother artist outside London. works alone studio day. listens Joe Rogen, Jordan Peterson conspiracy podcasts paints 14 hours straight going. 

Holy fucking anti masker, red pill, men's rights, clean room, Illuminati fucking psycho asshole become. Oh found Jesus 43 shut that's way fix mental health issues. cut life (again) start month. He's always POS, he's really *annoying* POS. Yeah, I'm disagreeing that. probably vaporware. lack progress rapid testing entirely disappointing. would literally save world right now. even really worth either test? I’m told it’s unreliable wouldn’t want gamble next move results anyway. completely agree think happen. living selfish culture. wankers come workplace ignorant masks wearing one important protect others. context work lot wealthy educated people That's biggest ingredient success really, geography means strict border control properly possible. realise amount unemployment we're gonna see hospitality sector dissolves lead mass poverty crashes potential homelessness around country.

Cry fucking river I'm living streets come January. am. I'm voting La Riva plan test everyone next weekend order capture many positive stage tests capture it. Yeah...Illinois looking best death-wise. ""Visualise"" talking dead people, think correct put dead people per capita bullshit. like saying, people small countries important people populated countries. Looks like political comment elections make looks good totally failure. Tipycal brainwashed comment example: ""In country (only) 220k deads 330m population bad, look numbers Belgium, Spain, Czech Republic make per capita numbers gonna see situation bad"". (Now per capita bullshit using numbers Japan, South Korea, China Taiwan came make comment per capita bullshit comparing numbers France USA) Already got mess Second damn yankees New York.

We's'a comin' ya! work trump part HB (big republican wear mask). TBF live US tested 3 times quickly free. Seems experience varies based location etc. (probably) reasons behind decision media public aware of.

It's literally public opinion.

They even withdraw submissions. *just politics*. people need ""cooperate"", otherwise would receive massive fines. course, everyone totally play according rules, would say someone gets tested positive, people staying home. Yeah time goes I'm seeing fallacy ""economic pain kill even people long term argument"". virus spreading much many people zero inadequate health coverage intense care required worst cases bankrupted - removing workers consumers. 

Also city 6,000 new cases day many people going going anyway, still get deaths financial ruin healthcare. 

Worst worlds really. Yeha defense, article clesrly states, responsability contact trace inform passengers New Mexico Health Department and/or CDC, neither agency asked even flight manifest. saying Spirit could done own, Health agencies dropping ball. “Nationwide” - apply England, devolved governments Scotland, Wales Northern Ireland already taken action. England last part UK anything increase cases!  🤦🏻‍♂️😞 Yeah like locked forever Well, hope turns ok, certainly! understand desire expose children all, regardless positivity rates. There's easy solution, still sit right. definitely obtuse. people get JobKeeper need JobKeeper completely irrelevant conversation. Aye that's fair enough really. Except news article talking shutting country entire month, really specific lol.
I'm Scottish got fright seeing this, thinking I'd missed something Thanks. American, agree. populations anywhere world 'in it'. times like leadership show value. Provided good leader. 
This true companies, community leaders nations alike. Hey, know aren’t getting Canada day soon. Americans resigned this. Glad took vacations chance! I'm 47 kids small (17 21). I'm afraid die, still need mom. nobody else. Even could somehow stop international supply chains without catastrophic consequences (you can't), 1.5 million cross-border commuters EU. lose job good?

And even commuters laid off, invite go google maps, zoom border two EU countries tell exactly plan close it. No, they're immune. know health officials say. mostly correct things, otherwise many others trust them. talked friend US day, said read article reports similar findings schools US. might wrong time though. Let's see situation 2 weeks. That's want meet decide and, yes, country needs change course. partial lockdown effect tomorrow, Monday 2nd, November 30. technology companies policies place label misinformation, easy direct, fixed set truths. 

So what's disinformation one day fact next? I’m looking new book. remember Wat learnt school. working class hero. I’ll check thanks! GL I'm rooting tbh. indecision, complacency complete lack care indicate country that's willing anything covid.

Imho, stage, americans prefer see much burn. want every house burning something.

That overwhelmingly actions suggest.

If that's want, let em it.

For Americans saying ""but everyone wants that, us sane"" well fucking prove it! done bare minimum trump years deal him.

If really cared, here. least 1 month late. guys criminally negligent. sinus surgery start allergic reaction masks minutes. can't even pretend I'm fine eyes start tearing I'll need wipe nose. moments want scream. want semblance life back really can't wear fucking mask.

I want *that* person though, stay home. want refuse dozen people demand treatment. want put employees position. worth grand scheme things.

It sucks is. misuse much possible time.

Minor correction. thread: whole lot paranoia. helpful though....

And people familiar US covid numbers Cos gets coverage sub, mostly made Americans think Trump power? hadn’t thought stress.... sort lock-down place, affect negative test (still gatherings, get hair cut, shopping wherever like etc.). 
If test positive, self isolate (or use state provided quarantine beds hotels) report doctor. 
If get tested, lock-down affects next 10 days (but go shopping essentials opposed tested positive). supermarkets self service tills. items arn't touched cashier. since tills take less space, enough spend less time standing queue shoppers. idea completely stupid forgot mention ""and children's education futures would fucked"".  sequel nobody wanted. Goes without saying really. thinking eat healthy, exercise _____ 

Like read vitamin helpful sensible immune response. Vitamin C high doses also meant good. 
Should lots cardio make heart lungs robust? seek information! bloody obtuse. simple English see problem.

When talking two things add number, means half. said 'most' people Australia get jobkeeper. 19M Australians (out 25M) get it. Hence, Australians get jobkeeper.

This getting silly. hate well actually guy, actually 51% population, 51% people actually voted. Total ballots cast Leave 17.4M 66M population. 26.23%.

Of 66M population, eligible 47M. turnout vote 70%

So leavers, remains people give shit. don’t reality show host running show. India go nearby government hospital, get token number, wait 30-40 minutes till number get tested rapid test kits, tell results hour though. 
 case test positive, get admitted go RTPCR test told stay home quarantined hospital depending severity. 

All happens free. 

You get tested private center $30, results take day two.  Went mall pickup last week... 1/3rd _workers_ wearing nothing, famous “my nose doesn’t need covered” kind protection.

Uk people always struck orderly considerate average. go door _actually_ matters? last even longer 14 days, incubation period longer 10 days uncommon. looking wrong way. Covid kills yes, lock down. People's jobs, health we'll affected. mild annoyance someone else's livilhood. Wow. Thanks info. think alot coutries could accelerate reviews soon Throw everyone jail ensure get rona Why? Agree! License this, make one, pay - quick, help us all! California positivity rate 3%. Texas positivity rate 10%. means Texas might cases Schools closing europe 🙄 apply roughly 1% CFR, means 10% whole population already virus. long winter started... either reached test capacity sure you’re talking China US, it’s probably simple. Absolutely. We’re fucked. Exactly. dont get peoples arguments economy getting fucked. going get fucked either way. netherlands politcian charge safety wedding 1.5 get enforced, end got fine slap wrist. 

Problem used say asshole dont comply rules. says, please comply would better healthcare. 

So opinon hes able job anymore. Even though fine slap enough punishment take strickt stance anymore. Yeah guess voting differently deserve die. Great take mate. Fuck people’s grandparents may may voted Tory want go pub. Really selfish take.

I understand frustration honestly fuck you. understand graph showed age people seriously affected covid admitted hospital. ages 50 especially 75 upwards, contracting figures from?

My wife nurse flu clinics past months elderly patients self isolating unless care homes old folk sneaking without protection figures high 50s?

One issue somewhere like Cornwall lesser extent southwest, going lockdown even though cases per 100000 significantly lower everywhere else country, makes sense.

The first lockdown showed Cornwall missed big outbreak even lifted summer case numbers extremley rare. lockdown prolong suffering fit healthy unable make living, mention winter already miserable time year mental health issues.

I envy government's task stuck rock hard place need realistic maybe accept fact need live covid carry lives. Hope nobody realizes one protestor's name city easily lead one find address phone number would real shame. Yes, prepare cult defenders get defend people costs, behavior typically (and appropriately) traced back religion. goal make people look good help religion save face Yea 

Seems like states restrictions follow Europe’s lead

So Europe’s keeping school open US community transfer Western Australia around 6 months. open back normal since June/July. Schools recently reopened person. Wake county NC.
some athletic attendees (not sure staff students) tested. Positive, along with. elementary schools. Again, saying staff students. Ahh got it. Thank much. bank it. Lockdown England, lockdown UK? depends store management really. store work enforced masks reopened first lockdown getting enough support company got really difficult abuse got stopped enforcing it. Boris said month mask usage stores mandatory started lot easier still exhausting getting constant abuse asking people bare minimum. However I'd rather make sure people wear deal put everyone risk. Dunno. Expect Curry’s outlet Croydon pilfered soon public decide don’t much like locked Xmas. Taking spirit seriously Many stores already like that, paying attention. Repeated displays, often tucked back corner. Fewer SKUs spread space. Beef sort normalized, different cuts, stores carrying things didn't, like lot pork.

A relative saying stores normal area, im sure would noticed. I'm also pretty spooked see lot headlines harvests good, havent seen that. 

Positive news blast right now, since April. Despite positivists think. media crazily optimistic, delusionally so. used consecutive, guidance updated cumulative, due new info come prison Vermont. lot organizations updated policies, though. S. Korea, mandatory mask wearing introduced relatively recently. that, wearing mask voluntary.  rains Melbourne basically every day. Certainly UK, mistake delay action early weeks. could see Spain Italy getting really bad, tell people wash hands. 
 
The weekend lockdown full round football fixtures (that's 100 professional teams across UK) Cheltenham Festival 70k people attending. mention Champions League games, one Spanish club. 
 
After late. Covid rampant. well 100k new infections every day, nowhere near capacity test. weeks delay chance Australia NZ did. blew government thought little Britain somehow special. 
 
We're not. government proven incapable getting decent test trace system place, incapable seeing danger planning advance, incapable procuring necessary PPE, incapable working private sector minimise impact care homes capable taking necessary action staring point blank face go way countries unless decisive action taken. So, they're going save us. obvious middle March people get us disaster average person street.

That said, government people spreading virus; they're blame people ignoring simple, basic guidelines. Chris Whitty stood alongside Boris Johnson back July outright said: ""if social distance we'll back March April"". Also, many people self-isolating told due infected contact someone infected.

Given happened country March April bordering criminal amount people simply ignored scientists telling us, made loud clear. So, blaming government time get us message repeated again, people change behaviour we're gonna go 'round circles ever increasing numbers lives, businesses, jobs community organisations gone forever. There's excuse people. Simple, basic principles guidelines: that's asked them. gonna happen here. place facts. think luck draw. 2 known strains means get both. also matter good health first place well immune system. take away stay fit eat nutritious food importantly WEAR MASK. surely one many first days! Nah, NY wrapped shutdown quicker fastest growing epidemic date. March 20 - April 30. Cumulative def deserves direct blame. 'man' literally threw away pandemic plan former administrations put together replaced plan: screaming hoax, fake news, wear masks. 

It fault. done high level compliance, could hopefully see crushing spread virus quickly may much effective targeted lockdowns almost everybody who's infected families self isolate. chains transmission would broken short time period.

This testing isolating mass scale. contact tracing part largely takes care everyone almost everyone tested.

Now viable weekly fortnightly basis, would amazing. imagine extremely costly. Even (or twice) may buy Slovakia months though. time finish saying hi person once, party ends epidemiologists Wales saying (based results backwards problems among adults socialising, new PHW data suggested schools ""not seeing extensive journal article looking thing different way. I've read abstract know they've factored in: kids go school = parents stay home interact less &amp; older children socialise way home. 

The problem might classroom per se, rather interaction outside classroom, either parents older children walking home mates.

Basically right, school/classroom major problem **and** closing schools work - unfortunately that's result public hate. cold season future I’ll wearing mask ever get crowded subway rest life now. said they’re trying kill anybody. That’s intention. It’s like driving car. Driving car deadly. 1% population die vehicle related accident, much higher odds dying COVID young single people. Nobody gets car tries kill anybody. say “connect dots”, driving kills hence people shouldn’t drive cars, maybe truth it, again, would say nobody tries drive kill someone. actual created AI pre-screening test discriminates 98.5% COVID-19 positives forced-cough recording, including 100% asymptomatics, essentially cost accompanying saliency map longitudinal explainability. 

The article good [research worth reading. far away tests currently used much practical. Also keep mind method get better training progresses. porch light on, driveway blocked still people knocking ringing doorbell. guess that's get years house goes Halloween. Years? Dude lot countries mostly ground spring vaccine work. Whatever medical advice is, that's we're doing. would expect less government power here.

Testing health dept rapid, back log prioritize calling positives back immediately(day of) negatives sometime next week. lockdown hoax? tiktok? well, like breathing anyone point...

/s yes Texas it!! entire interview Washington Post. asked questions, answered. I’ve listen two interviews Diane Rehm totaling 90 minutes. Imagine taking single sentence someone asks “why would say that?!” dunno, don’t read entire interview get back us. republicans.

So explains That's fascist supposed ""consecutive"" ""cumulative""? Many fellow Americans know asses holes ground either. People WANT care. want keep living lives pretending OK.

People believe anecdotes data. ""No one circle yet one get it.""

This result teaching two entire generations people special opinions always right instead instilling critical thinking skills. Social media made problem exponentially worse.  keep hearing people say “we’re careful, hey we’ve made quarantine pod!” really making larger pool people get infected. testing don’t count day - it’s daily New infection, Total. E.g Canada: 
 
Daily New cases: 2,500 
Total Active cases: 30,000 Uneducated fool Wealthiest county Michigan. COVID deaths per capita Italy, Spain UK though, excess mortality much lower could keep fully functioning healthcare system throughout.

All enacting extreme restrictions civil liberties countries - point making.

Their main failure, apparent data, lack attention shielding people care homes - main contributor death rate. Sounds like live shithole County. offense late resolve so. live virus. them... ""From Nov. 7, restrictions expanded 23 types places, include department stores, theme parks hair salons.""


Like wtf? requirements masks already place three establishments? “Galavanting across England”? Give break. Ok little bro don’t cry abt I’m saying odds reinfection average covid survivor likely currently extremely low (that’s real information) don’t gotta baby dude lol especially I’m tryna nice u Ron swanson always purely political enforced know hospitals can’t handle it. Expect Karen’s come loud hard need beer ice cream shop. car can’t get fixed blah blah. Cars don’t need fixed aren’t allowed leave. Pretend it’s 1500 figure stay home quit complaining, get with. lol. small detail mentioned linked page :)

thanks Loss smell/taste common symptom......  Literally took querctin zinc citrate lol Especially morons. Proud jurisdiction man (Dan man) followed exactly science 100% stuck plan despite ridiculous levels criticism entire time. 


I think results point speak themselves, considering rest world going through. Everything song spot on!

Well apart spelling Stansted. Feck. Big whoop - extrapolate Belgium still reigns ~600K infected/day - win! Well almost summer. Yes, Covid contagious flu. measures place actually slowing Covid quite bit, R rate 3 - R number Covid held 1-2 everywhere, flu restrictions normally 1.3 flu season kicks gear. follows reproductive rate halved right average, Covid new cases keep growing flu cases decreased find difficult take off, chains transmission much weaker. 

What New Zealand, say, winter likely possible with, say, novel measles pandemic, R number gets 12-18 restrictions. Good luck bringing 1. Collapsing doesn’t take long. Yes, kids develop social skills needed get basically education. Crazy. Belgium roughly 11.6 million inhabitants. Hence 1/1000 there's 11.6k deaths Starting Thursday, obviously coronavirus going start getting angry Thursday Hmm love Canada one seems redundant me. golf year round southern England maybe? think Chinese response really good. live Heilongjiang wear masks since August. could teach public school September two covid tests. One beginning August one end. 


I want go back west, though frustrated lack progress. kind feel like stuck China. oh shit thats kinda scummy know ._. really is. Robin Williams fantastic actor. People realize difficult comedy pull off, comedians great dramatic acting. Look Tom Hanks. opposite true well, like Leslie Nielson Airplane Naked Gun movies. turn around time less 2 days using labcorp. news another planet Thanks info. sounds like gonna miss lot family I'm sure they'll miss too. go. pissed old enough vote time. could maybe live Brexit stretched long quite liked idea remain mostly cos people chatting shit positive hypotheticals leaving EU. minister explained today talking too, decided to, would make impossible test everyone weekend, would slow whole process, anyone wants science project, can, days. Even without PCR testing, capacity testing spots people material maximum, places people waiting line four hours. Peter Cottontail fucking antidote. obvious. Also hit pretty hard early lot residents need(ed) travel work brought in, lot testing established. bit harder get test rural Michigan. like odds vaccine (definitely oxford it’s proven safe) regardless one works doctors nurses get better treating thing every day eventually enough time we’d able handle fly, longer time vaccine one anti-American moderators sub. Could even Russian China propagandists. article gets posted posted deleted ""low quality"" information. 

The essay interviewed 1) former head PREDICT. agency tasked early identification infectious diseases. 2) lead researcher first identified Covid Taiwan 3) top scientist fighting covid South Korea. Goin' spirit sky (spirit sky) 

That's I'm gonna go die (when die) Wearing mask protect yourself, protects others. According China. believe elected Governor one asked run. Please vote 2021. Ah yes, assume people disagree racist. true sign someone trying find common ground opposition /s Recently we've testing 5-10k fewer compared last week... think Maureen give sod??

&amp;#x200B;

Check thoughts here: Sitting flights long time causes also. Seems weird went asymptomatic dead flight. case Spirit sucks owed everyone timely notification. US troops broke proto actual peaceful protest looks like. Chinas big fat winnie pooh joke 30% N95 Surgical per study weeks ago. Cloth 10-15% blasphemy. anti-America pro virus posts allowed sub!! really hope right without can't see anything going 'round circles country.

But, asked bank it: centuries experience vaccine development tells us expect effective vaccine running within next months. spirit, corpse became “luggage” bill $8,422 charged card. Pretty sure tiny gentleman would lock sister closet hours, given chance... Lol yeah ever nationwide lockdown first place... evidence conclusive yet, vitamin D, melatonin, zinc vitamin C show potential benefit. Antibody plasma treatment may beneficial accessible outside research settings. Nah, chance. Nobodies listening rules now, think they’re gonna listen rules Christmas? Strength Strength part? U call famous historical photo mystery solver lady TV. Maureen Taylor. solves photo ID mysteries PBS antique appraisal shows. could ID'd pic shamed admitting indeed man  already people call sick every Friday day weather nice. unlimited paid, anything ever get done? anyone ""suckers"" work Friday? allergies asthma never better, masking great us. Masking allows people get lives go outside..... Seems pretty huge man, don’t know you’re science anything would cool see others think. many. source titled South China Morning Post way... Remember US, ""mask"" means ""face covering,"" necessarily anything stop aerosols. public health advice idea something better nothing, significant minority population going without, effect guaranteed. Also Hassan Rouhani said Saturday new restrictions take effect Wednesday 25 Iran’s 31 provinces 10 stringent new restrictions include closure schools, universities mosques stem third wave virus Iran, government [also] banned weddings, wakes conferences Iranian capital notice. Apple Pay ftw I'd invite invited sisters kids. 31 people, expecting. Someone give comment gold. Focus anger.

Palpatine you? ""*Response*"" whole denying simultaneously trying pin US troops? Australia, Victoria. Every state really easy, little changes day day life except maybe NSW pointless now, massive inaction government killed 5x many people every action take little late.

We relatively small island, could've contained relative ease bojo sad excuse man somehow managed make every wrong decision months.

He never able enact lockdown rapidly losing respect people would've followed rules half masking ""but liberty"" American wannabe morons follow anyway. Everything show.

If really wanted save economy would've acted swiftly harshly beginning. choice alternative increased unemployment Tory ""Fuck Poors"" MPs never allow. Stop testing shut nationwide hospitals. lot Individuals extremely stupid looks like pretty established relationship me. Covid19 often lethal runaway inflammation, viral load high anymore.

I've read J&amp;J [vaccine showed deadly dose hamsters.
For viral illnesses, established well.
Some professionals try explain lower CFRs observed early summer reduced dose, could well better mucosal state mild weather whatever fully adjust stats. probably pulmonary embolism (blood clot lung). feel well causes sudden death. known complication covid. Sure sounds good we’re tad bit busy adding sugar. thats pretty amazing operation hope countries learn like proof say impossible actually achieved. worry growing numbers comes point people constantly getting bombarded virus, could get uglier. Ok I’m breaking laws 🤷🏻‍♀️ serious? many crazies st george area. China uses both, batch-drop pooled antigen test well, idea company/institute. think consensus CFR 0.5 %. island help much given major air traffic Sydney Melbourne (as well other) fairly densely populated. Victoria demonstrated, breaches quarantine defences (which could happened state times did) get control quickly indeed. Fortunately brought control close run thing there. sounds like country trying deal COVID ... one hasnt given trying control it. many countries like that. Lots outed protest march, cops picked lot others got yogurt thrown thats impressive detailed thank u Wow. partner teacher (so like rifht next door). notified covid case class class shut down. sent home (paid) allowed back 2 weeks last contact kid (even though got negative tes). actually think bit much, imo negative test allow go back work.... already get shit getting people space queue, gonna people giving shit matter what, least enforce makes get make store giving shit. I’m certain that’s reason. Enough people complying PPE regs shouldn’t seeing spike social care sector. Either far asymptomatic cases thought, lasts outside body far longer predicted.

Hope wife ok. things like support homes community, contact tracing staffing levels relatively easy manage. Can’t imagine running clinic like. Uk well plans keep open directly, evidence growing. monkeys infected MERS virus (a cousin Covid virus) different amounts, high dose group disease similar moderate human disease, lower dose groups mild Looks evidence people got infected despite mask protection likely mild/asymptomatic infections people completely unprotected. Swiss study suggests physical distancing may similar effect. What's false positive vs false negative rate?  year ago walked PCP's office demanded tested influenza symptoms *might* asymptomatic carrier, probably would gotten psych referral.  

The focus testing *symptomatic* people getting results fast possible either isolate get back lives. lot faith Biden fix underlying issues brought us Trump. fear 2024. press conference I'm thinking - one first I'd watched ages -I believe context comparatively well comment reference deaths hospitalizations compared locations similar (historical) percentage positive. Combined fact lot places testing capacity test everyone needed numbers high. get wrong, cringe everytime ""our numbers higher test more"" line spoken anyone, actually surprised sharing data actually gave support statement. make feel less excuse justify numbers though.

I think Burgum science denier. However, stance get go always towards ""personal responsibility"". That's great all, except large portion population ignorant selfish, gets majority ""news"" facebook.

October ugly month ND burned nursing homes. big push always protect vulnerable population, residents state failed miserably. Something add up. So... woman walks airport, stands line, boards plane. Plane takes within hour 2 (not sure timeframe), deadly symptoms Covid-19 quickly overwhelmed system died flight. Amazing.   Good. Still voting though. realize immune system also kill you, right?

With Covid-19 aka SARS2, trigger autoimmune response called Cytokine Cascade Cytokine Storm. shown happen SARS1 patients 10+ years ago, we're seeing portion SARS2 patients now.

It's like Goldilocks story.. immune system needs weak, strong.

You need careful telling people things like that. agree immune system kept healthy balanced, comments throughout thread misleading. son admitted week, told nurses needed wear mask outside room. Probably different scenario you’re talking about, though. using antigen tests, similar pregnancy tests result spot, 15-30 min. 4,900 testing spots 14,500 medical staff also soldiers, policemen, administrative workers, volunteers. similar elections, people waiting lines one spot able test 50-60 people per hour. voluntary, get tested, curfew applies next 10 days, allowed go buy essentials nearest shop. Lot people can't stay home work unpaid leave, that's almost half whole population tested yesterday already, people need negative certificate work mostly. Lot people also wants know healthy test free, others want protect families. schools remain open. Idiotic lunatic genocidal Germany call several softdrinks lemonade. stronger branding Cola Pepsi get called lemonade(we rather call darker softdrinks Cola)

Sprite Fanta also called lemonade. 

Even Energydrinks sold transparent bottles sometimes get called lemonade. Germany : 518,753 cases 10,452 deaths
USA : 8,952,086 cases 228,185 deaths.

and say mask make difference .

Yea, trust Fauci way you. Bread crap, regardless type? News me. results two weeks able vaccinate risk people healthcare workers reduce death rate significantly would enough get mess Around 1k turned weeks ago Really boggles mind doh line logic. operator tested positive. workplace e classified low risk 1. found another confirm case operator weekend. 2. operator havent work since become symptomatic. rebuttal, 2 weeks asymptomatic period, DOH surely rules odds worker contract work asymptomatic last two weeks. like dealing highschooler here, finding first possible reasoning prove solution impossible. think need teach sooner school, real world 1 answer always available pick one that's probable. Anyways tldr, DOH petty bad, even Canada number spiking now. Around 1k. even mean? obvious reasons: they're still going trials, 'no guarantees vaccines, would phenomenal achievement get effective vaccine quickly (experience would suggest unlikely), logistics 
involved enough people vaccinated achieve herd immunity on.

I think would unwise put eggs vaccine basket. What's needed people following simple, basic guidelines now: would wise move. zero cases middle winter (June) second outbreak occurred escaped hotel quarantine. got zero cases following medical advice leaders (at least state leaders) undermine it. 

Less weather, leaders making hard choices. Nobody thinks announced mid flight. contacted passengers afterward. Yeah wife thought may passed via post food deliveries etc. Either way issue needs addressing vocalising. Thats mitzbah, right? Volunteering help save lives! barely breathing, sweating, bad fever, people would fucking noticed likely even able get plane two feet. Something else killed her.  trying tell me, English person, whether country country lmao. assure is. understand doctor's note usually costs $100 4+ hours urgent care US? US, broken leg generally involves unpaid medical leave, available job longer people stay low level jobs.

If fire people taking sick days, really offer sick days, you? ""working conditions"" work all, surprising number people want work would prefer nothing intoxicating substances watch youtube videos.

As Germany kind uberfunctional dreamland work, kinda funny used work German immigrant left apparently impossible find job Germany become unemployed, came US work Walmart. procedures logistically voting: Gyms / Schools / administrative buildings place allow every person country 3 min interaction within day without much waiting / queing.

So replacing 3 minutes filling ballot 3 minutes taking salvia sample / etc. currently 50K active cases. test 2.5 mln people get 25K cases, that's representative, conclude 25K 2.5 mln people. Therefore, they've caught 50K 100K PCR tests 200 critical currently. means 0.2% infected critical time writing assumptions numbers. include anybody might've caught passed current wave. Yup! several deaths daily could’ve avoided everyone listened scientists. me, seems like huge issue. Covid 19 affecting Florida infecting thousand day. someone old enough remember Czechoslovakia eastern Soviet Bloc country - comment made brain pause moment. LOL, world changes.  least people US point finger EU tell lockdown work. 

I problem watching dumpster fire burning smell getting annoying. Get shit together please. see u (and enjoyed it). Yeah, many people trust vaccine anyway. I’m Canada, massive number people talk (fully agree non-scientific method) claim refuse vaccine years it’s proven safe (in minds)

The look shock, tell first line release day, unreal. Sorry guess original comment confusing. I’m saying it’s ridiculous someone would accuse expert playing politics giving opinion. seem like level headed dude appreciate Would better PCR test since accurate. Nonetheless awesome effort great job. Many countries learn Slovakia. 👏👏 exactly good news.. Good try, nothing perfect. Lol dude weird man. fauci oxford vaccine 100 million year end Healthy scepticism, mate.

I rule anything anything out, tend go experience: telling us winter months going fly expect situation dramatically improved April.

Someone, somewhere gonna come something pretty special reverse experience current trends telling us. Wow! removed every politician says thoughts prayers? restricted BBQ &amp; pie tables. make correction, asked question clarification. correction didn’t come doubled fabricated numbers.  Belgian here. Testing strategy changed. symptomatic people tested testing capacity maxed out.

If show 2 symptoms, advised stay home, call doctor refer testing center. tested immediately. Could easily take another 24 hours. wait results takes another 24 48 hours.

So, stats see tell ""this amount people got infected past 24 hours"" rather ""these amount tests processed past 24 hours symptomatic people."" Different metric entirely.

At point, become entirely unclear true number infected people really is. Hence lockdown measures again. Yet Ben Shapiro says American health care way better Canadian health care, buddy idea talking about. right, nobody talking long term effects still years away finding out. I'm waiting 1 year mark wake zombies Rick Grimes shows up. thing. wrong. Covid 19 deadlier vaccine it. Covid 19 totally like seasonal flu. US right Europe right resurgence? coming us. teacher, native English speaker. language much easier spelling might factor. language eather can't read write. really people read poorly, unless dyslexia. pretty much everyone reads speed subtitles third grade. plenty peer reviewed research back up.

Most doctors give dietary advice (nor refer someone else can) part treatment plans. lot western medicine based around applying band aid people continue without addressing root cause. Hah, that's part skillset required get well par 9 hole course. Every knows throw ball start next hole everyone owes quid. poster means t-word, one can't say here. Kinda proud Slovak rn. actually didnt go get tested since already quarantine Covid. best care world, absolutely free. overly optimistic; at-risk healthcare workers, people vaccinate end pandemic, vaccinated April, vaccine expected widespread Fauci. COVID also getting point secondary issues surpass threat virus society almost certainly go past march

Furthermore, three vaccines phase 3 success rate phase 3 vaccine 86% around odds one three failing less 0.1 percent

Also, saw downvoted multiple people lol. support misinformation dude. gonna incredibly interesting watch Slovakia's numbers weeks following survey. like country's biggest coronavirus outbreak months "" 197 active cases 14 new cases day.
 
That's rookie numbers. matter hole stick in, nothing act debuff. summarized thoughts exactly. pleasently surprised sceptical too. Due stupid coincidences waited 4 hours line, seen lot patient polite people. operation far perfect boost morale faith nation rewarding much results testing quarantines. needed good news positivity. Bruh gotta critical way said ~1000 people. ""Around"" could mean 1000 +/- 200. Around could mean 1000 +0 -200, close 1000 probably 220,000+ Americans died 8 months beg differ. Wow! Thank you. I've exposed dad sick covid. recovered already, bringing food stuff might exposed. I've since taken 3 pcr tests.over period two weeks, well antibody tests. 3 came back negative. Pcr showed nothing. Antibody showed nothing. guaranteed exposure.

From figured article antibodies means I've virus bloodstream. correct? body recognize virus. donating blood plasma? something understand well. correlation there. governments fund billboard advertising promo campaigns people keep eye vit c/d zinc? masks social distancing believe boosting immune system equally important. also telling people need masks period beginning. Sure, prevent panic buying, people remember that. I’m sorry inform Trump GOP/Republicans welded together. You’re going able escape it. hope don’t end interviewed family’s regional newspaper. good sign. Along leak Scotland starting vaccinations December. massive outbreak covid going must lot data trials showing people got vaccine getting sick much lower rates. probably leaks accelerated approvals vaccines starting. Fingers crossed. article June 2020 CNN's back pages source? Yeah, ok, sure. 

LOL, say ""sources,"" mean actual scientific paper checked peer review actual flyer NIH CDC. 

If can't produce it, go bye-bye. didnt create 25000 new ones. see tho. next days like politicians making marketing 2-3 weeks

And end situation dont make plan avoid future  makes useless Hey now, bemefits.

Those enjoy crystals scientific neutral historic value class people.

It helpful entire customer base pay double anything collection knowledgable amateur geologist would though throw metaphysical bullshit terms.

Not everyone collecting rocks one head company. WAIT:  thought testing equals cases? telling Trump knowingly lying us?  :) worries bud Mate he’s trying argue point too. Obviously rando septic Texas knows us English though right? Large gatherings arent allowed (even summer werent allowed).

But surrouned france hard hit region belgium.

Every day nearly 300k frontier workers crossing border work here.

The difference france belgium able introduce new lockdown. governement doesnt power.

Furthermore, summer long much strict rules neighbours, unfortunately lead large opposition new measures.

So yeah people dont want new measures, attitude ""If die, die"" opposition knows this. (the gov needs 2/3 majority new lockdown) Chin Diaper. Oh yeah, really took us while. We've customers refuse leave get served even though tell we'll happy serve come back mask. Sort stuff makes throw hands air disbelief. 

We security, no. We're centre centre security there's much do. incident month guy threatening staff grabbed flimsy protection screens front till move get us. tried call centre security leave radio given working get anything. worst. blow Americans decided president going be, right? weren’t told happened find read certain news sources. 2500 new (PCR) cases per day. 
After global testing, isolate 25 000+ infectious (Ag) people week two greatly reduce new (PCR) daily cases, would expect go 500 (after 2 weeks).

But also expect big increase (PCR) following days, since lot positively tested (Ag) people go confirm PCR, together close contacts. Australia bigger lower 48. China? see can't here. we're OK back March many places. Shit overly optimistic take \*AT LEAST\* fall 2021 vaccinate people (the US) want vaccinated. significant amount people want vaccinated make COVID harder bring control.

And like said depends vaccines proven effective guaranteed. 

I know want think March need prepared another year (through end 2021). participated got negative certificate continue going work. got test small village. Waited 2hrs total line results. cities created gridlock massive lines. arguably safe becuase people exactly distancing. 

Overall question useful be. accurate tests? biggest question happens next? 28k families stay home. long last? another small period time pat back well did, go back normal life everyone pubs, weeks later shutdown comes back? get sense create false security. Slovaks hard time following rules is. negative certificate, certainly feel empowered disregard safeguards. No. made correction petty can't let fuck go claiming theres bias. need Jon Snow People who’s every day job prevent day one blame. People made country unable produce quality masks. People opposed set rules regulations. Remember US state government overrule Federal mandated requirements 90% democratic ILLINOIS worst outbreak even though fought Trump tooth nail day one. next New York. Trump power “the blame”. enjoy activity wearing mask, hugging everyone sharing food drinks them. 

I'm sure people saying similar things washing hands using bathroom handling food. Correlation causation 90% either take vaccine magically develop antibodies. truth never get there, lifetimes; hell, difficulty maintaining 90% needed herd immunity MMR, whooping cough, diphtheria! 

Unfortunately, take millions die batch humans get it. abused, sure.  Weather plays big role. Viruses love coldy environment. ask; Australia summer heat season.  Opinion pieces aren’t reliable sources. exactly plan moving forward tests?

They tested population, going close borders vaccine widely available? going repeat every month keep positive people quarantine much possible? data gathering, everything continues testing done? also browsing made smartass comment, mine actually made sense


(because read article) Tried, never found effective personally. Well didnt say Im lockdown.

Its governement says.

Read comment below, already explained mean. hospitals reach point triage patients. death rate soar enough oxygen supplies everyone needs ventilators. want risk 5% death rate instead .5% ? like world war z Fold home project ? Hats Slovakia. need start teaching critical thinking skills school. need teach it’s ok question things... take anything faith seek proof. 

Yeah, tried that, parents got angry 'indoctrinating' kids. one wants say it, number one reason nearly 240,000 deaths U.S. people stupid proud it. Would interesting different would Murdoch media outright hostile.

I mean, sky news 24/7 driving thumbscrews in, anyone wanted self-flagellate could tune find rage growing within them.

But course ""free press"" one virtues democracy... Even one man supplies 70%+ it, apparently. don’t know thank you. really hearing people making sacrifices careful. Thank you! range would based literally nothing all. 9-year-old charge country could exceeded standards. do, bare minimum, put national mask mandate place could saved tens thousands lives, even majority numbers Americans died far. fauci source dude yeah mods laugh u considering u threw temper tantrum attacked three times

with three vaccines phase 3 success rate phase 3 vaccine 86% around odds one three failing less 0.1 percent

please lurk Lots ongoing discussion school. I’d like see teachers/parents comment midst person.

I two high schoolers (athletes) middle schooler. Fairly large district. schools seem strict masks distancing. also plastic barriers desks ends tables cafeteria. It’s perfect scenario better nothing right?

Anyway, we’ve school 8 weeks limited spread. middle school many 3 cases. High school almost exclusive sports maskless play. adjusting protocols try improve safety cases come down. 

Schools able enforce safety compliance. consequences anyone breaking safety protocols - harshest one kicked extracurriculars sent online school rest school year. seems work. 

Spread community seems coming outside schools.  zero consequences taking safety precautioning adults. ""Xinjiang week recorded dozens new infections. Thursday, region reported 14 new cases, taking total active caseload 197, according China's National Health Commission.

It's country's biggest coronavirus cluster since 180 infections reported in capital Beijing in June."" Well argument argument gov.

Furthermore gov doesnt even power declare new lockdown, need approval opposition (because 2/3 majority)

The opposition even voted law introduced curfew.

And also guardian constitution said last law basic rights constitution, whole thing delayed week.

So yeah chances high opposition guardian constitution would block every new lockdown. Abstract 

Introduction: date, effective treatments decreasing hospitalizations COVID-19 infections. suggested influenza vaccine might attenuate severity COVID-19. 

Methods: retrospective single-centered cohort review de-identified database 2,005 patients age 18 within University Florida health care system tested positive COVID-19. Comorbidities influenza vaccination status examined. Primary outcome severity disease reflected hospitalization ICU admission. logistic regression performed examine relationship influenza status hospitalization. 

Results: Covid-19 positive patients received influenza vaccination within last year 2.44 (1.68, 3.61) greater odds hospitalization 3.29 (1.18, 13.77) greater odds ICU admission compared vaccinated. results controlled account age, race, gender, hypertension, diabetes, COPD, obesity, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure. 

Discussion: analysis suggests influenza vaccination potentially protective moderate severe cases COVID-19 infection. protective effect holds regardless comorbidity. literature points potential mechanism via natural killer cell activation. Though data potentially limited generalizability vaccination rate low, holds significant relevance given upcoming influenza season. could simply encouraging influenza vaccination decrease morbidity mortality flu, might help flatten curve regards COVID-19 epidemic well. encourage studies finding. would argue 60 seconds minute. Still really good. Yes, find something better time. interested public health, I'm sure places sector looking volunteers. sub would lose mind instead Britain said ""Trump's FDA"". parts Texas really bad El Paso Valley, essentially Mexico Please sir, living perfectly fine cockroaches turned lights on. [Antigen vs Antibody – Trump: would zero, much testing! Boo! get it, realistically chance America getting without vaccine. I'm still surprised people still believe whole ""land free"" bullshit. Everybody knows tracked constantly, they're afraid admit themselves.

I'm sure problem filling form may help contact tracing is. seems brainer me. hospitals texas? fair Illinois, we've almost done many tests Texas, less half population. Also 3rd biggest city, 2nd populated county country. said, numbers terrifying right now. Winter going awful here. anything reward still working? Genuine question. personally I'm crazy publishing working others get stay home. Take look guys comments want know he’s downvoted Outside testing stations okay, many places tests done indoors. That's bit different. Meth:we’re it

Covid:We’ve got it! thing that, sure, N95 masks help tremendously worn health workers. much masks work real world worn average Joe? see people wearing masks, also take off, reach them, touch hands....etc... imagine help, overall effectiveness probably high. Thank :) US states. Sweden. Even South Korea never formal lock sure downvoted correct 🤷🏻‍♀️

None ""required quarantine"" policies states enforceable. lip service.

I appreciate effort appear like virus taken seriously needs backed real action, too. ever going replace Andrews with? potato O'Brien approval rating 18%? Stop drinking Murdoch kool-aid unless ok wrong side history. us isn’t homogenous body regard covid response means. states schools open don’t. districts within states schools open don’t. schools open, students 50% capacity plexiglass walls students. Idk say UK superior protections place don’t know US protections across country. School otherwise. instance, Southern California, LA county protections different Orange County protections. I'm Chinese.
It's clear ridiculous.
If find ridiculous, come back one 10 years, guest. underground bars basically going appear then. People stop drinking force people drink home. Whatever happens happens. virus us forever. developed nation. needs now. Yup, that's point. Even people wondering another shut going do. good number homes lack running water, makes handwashing difficult. herd immunity vaccinations kick Autumn 2021, I'm ditching mask. Every country this. month wait thats 10s thousands lives lost. get guidelines also weigh catastrophic sometimes. LWA? multi generational households caretakers elderly risk? people put risk work keep roof heads go home older risk household members EMA (the European Medicine Agency) already started rolling review AstraZeneca Pfizer Coronavirus vaccine candidates mid-October.  love Canada to. want make look like top things, reality want keep shops open holiday shoppers. Reddit moment lol things grossed moment started showing stores. That's challenged court. end DC Court Appeals, stacked Trump appointees. expectation Biden wins Tuesday order review takes office January, reverse it. author Apollos Arrow, highly recommended Depends contact history. Quarantine important, close contacts recently, probably worth testing see whether contacts need test isolate well. Best luck wish speedy recovery. likely management. worked home spring (teacher) clear us much work tough administration prove wasnt. know teacher put less 2 hours total week would talk it. job like sales something super easy prove effort/success thsn probably. jobs thst dont clear success see management wants would say 2nd biggest....as politically dividing us watching us destroy seems like even effective. would discuss you, worth since keep latching onto spread effectiveness. Note: referring virus' lifespan cold environment. Also, need degree anything life well versed something that's otherwise basic scientific knowledge. fact completely overlook fact cases increased immensely places heading winter, goes show cannot compute 1+1. Since insisting: (this article requires think openly, give concrete answer question). Rohrschach enters chat...

""You misunderstand. me"". bias what? can't make statement like. makes sense. said 92% still enough antibodies fight virus 5 months. 

That's pretty decent, think. case like would blowing multiple times fix 10% inaccuracy problem? Yea really trying shoe foot feel. I’m fortunate enough work home corporate America I’ve seen much forced situations suffering. It’s shit around, US let get bad begin with. you’re hurting cash send PM bzzus I’ll see do. We’re together, remember compassion end day. Congrats Australia, man want donut. wish grocery store would add bakery items curbside pick selection.  Yea gonna lie even covid recovered person took lot willpower play 2k New Zealand even better. elderly otherwise high risk stay home isolate slovakia west lol  ain't fear anymore, tiresome. refuse lower expectations common decency. Leave mess leave social environment? law, still jackass. attitude service people because, hey, law? jackass. Refuse wear mask curtail physical interactions pandemic? jackass. copycat similar name? I've read, Dutch company still process testing Covid-19: Dutch version currently specificity rate 75% (from article), whereas Singapore version achieved 95%. Specificity rate refers proportion people virus-free correctly identified such.

So really doubt same, despite using similar techniques. That's picture reddit captures ""social media images"" That's picture reddit captures ""social media images""  Sooooo “afraid shadow” trying aide killing grandparents one hospitalized month ICU week? true. companies cannot ordered release anything..... they're private business meet guidelines years. guidelines fast tracked we've realized need bullshit years years red tape. Operation Warp Speed proven that. 


And no, add time line. timeline regardless companies signed efficacy pact. week. actually found 1st exposure gossip, 2nd posting attempt get tested urgent care, Facebook. different coworker responded asking getting tested her, COVID 3rd time apparently tell anyone. ate lunch them, maskless obviously, small lunch room.

It's definitely hospital dropping ball, testing employees, safe work environment, contact tracing. Earlier tried instating policy employee exposed COVID+ patient, going inform employee started showing symptoms. 🤦‍♀️ 1) really depends job. you’re freelancer? Unlikely. (And course, many places moving towards freelancers/contractors instead “employees” save this.) you’re part-time? Again, unlikely. (And strategy companies used get around providing insurance multiple part-time roles instead full-time roles.). 

Regarding “going regular doctor,” a) lot people don’t regular doctor aforementioned insurance issues, b) least experience, might wait multiple hours *for* regular doctor you’re walk-in day of.  

Basically, doctor’s note strategy good in-theory, ways US employment healthcare system fucking awful, would another burden worker would incentivize go work sick. Sigh... Must fuckin' nice. one meant receive turned antibodies unable recipient. said felt grateful asymptomatic covid patient encouraged others afraid vaccine process. 

Sounds like nice dude. Meanwhile...  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ talking about? much get coming from, someone dangling thread money since first shutdown, advocate people work suspecting acknowledging Covid-19. tough position in, ultimately better good stay home assure spread people. faster people acknowledge faster situation. relation money, extremely depressingly, really email everyone state government push assistance families affected pandemic. good answer, control. control pandemic responsible. Yes, still high (56) Great image. They'll scale hospital capacity, develop better remedies work vaccine. Come March, spend year inside house family me, two years. definitely celebrate staying power throwaway account, bro. expect? answer close example, Western Australia state around 2.5 million people, closed even bordering states community transmitted COVID case 6 months so. shopping centers, cinemas, universities open like normal since July. NL people:

What's opinion this?

There several countries getting decrease cases. never know due actual improvement situation due change metric policies, decrease testing, local vacations, strikes... reason. Yes. don’t think it’s direct comparison 1) flu relies that; covid helped might fair say something like “if flu prevalence goes 0 10 covid must go 10 100”. 2) don’t really attempt control flu way behaviorally whereas lot people trying really hard Lol you’re prbly correct y’all twist change definition alt-right point end calling plain old conservative part alt right. Dude r u telling already covid xD simultaneously means don’t celebrate antibody staying power okay give per capita infection rate? couldn’t find lot numbers given relation othets Trum showen either anything fix this. Biden least knows pandemic still going on. puts better start Trump. Stop focusing lethality rate. terrible people die number people puts hospital real problem. take weeks recover Covid point released. point, celebrate! survived Covid! See, kill everyone!

But took bed disease probably could avoided mitigated simple steps, else needed bed illness accident, recover result? many people going live pain non-urgent ops cancelled? many businesses shut realised ill went town shedding virus?

What long term damage virus done you?

We asked something difficult try slow virus spread, take steps consider impact others. Plenty people *are* - significant minority refuse accept short term inconvenience unless compelled so, everyone suffers. Really went tangent floss eyes lmaooo Yeah doubt working were...a lot parties last night... telehealth, phone visit. They're going get covid test. doctor best advise illness treatment plan. reddit. Anecdotal experience, doesn’t feel far of, honestly. Everyone know that’s gotten sick since sept gone go get tested tested positive. 

I’m pretty sure negative tests right ones done routinely (like moms nursing home tests residents weekly) thought.  FDA show independence scientific rigor making sure USA last country Western world approve vaccine.  question wait inauguration day? March, CDC said masks effective. work world? Exactly.

I'm happy managed get point applicable to, Idk, Belgium. Yes, does. confusing antibody test? already tried Jalisco. resulted death 30 year old man arrested given family signs beating beaten shot leg. didnt even work, Jalisco one states deaths country. 

Our police grossly incompetent. abuse power dont need another reason arresting people.  Still plenty trolls living denial. kind people get upset see someone wearing mask, want reminded reality. 

**Abstract:**

Goal: hypothesized COVID-19 subjects, especially including asymptomatics, could accurately discriminated forced-cough cell phone recording using Artificial Intelligence. train MIT Open Voice model built data collection pipeline COVID-19 cough recordings website (opensigma.mit.edu) April May 2020 created largest audio COVID-19 cough balanced dataset reported date 5,320 subjects. Methods: developed AI speech processing framework leverages acoustic biomarker feature extractors pre-screen COVID-19 cough recordings, provide personalized patient saliency map longitudinally monitor patients real-time, non-invasively, essentially zero variable cost. Cough recordings transformed Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficient inputted Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based architecture made one Poisson biomarker layer 3 pre-trained ResNet50’s parallel, outputting binary pre-screening diagnostic. CNN-based models trained 4256 subjects tested remaining 1064 subjects dataset. Transfer learning used learn biomarker features larger datasets, previously successfully tested Lab Alzheimer’s, significantly improves COVID-19 discrimination accuracy architecture. Results: validated subjects diagnosed using official test, model achieves COVID-19 sensitivity 98.5% specificity 94.2% (AUC: 0.97). asymptomatic subjects achieves sensitivity 100% specificity 83.2%. Conclusions: AI techniques produce free, non-invasive, real-time, any-time, instantly distributable, large-scale COVID-19 asymptomatic screening tool augment current approaches containing spread COVID-19. Practical use cases could daily screening students, workers, public schools, jobs, transport reopen, pool testing quickly alert outbreaks groups. Yeah, running joke family three adults, can't invide family seven adults. invite you. gets decide time crisis is? government? funding fathers made constitution way guarantee us basic freedom never taken away others said get tested ill clue something happened - 

i got sick, delayed it, turned cytokine storm two days go hospital developed sepsis.

It fever violent shivering lips fast breathing heartbeat gave away. Similar correlation MMR vaccine. Orange County historically bastion Republicans. Yeah article said 90% accuracy Nope objectively wrong that's also comment got removed high quality information. nice day!! thing multivitamins contain lots vitamin E, probably harmful. Especially vitamin avoided thinking getting pregnant. B's important though C harmless. No. late US execute pandemic plan. current pandemic last pandemic. \^\^\^ Hate family huh? Maybe get divorce? - **completely** aware reinfected another strain one originally got. 

 - also **completely** aware immunity means white bloodcells combat virus attaches cells again. 

You **pretending** understand this, want people polite deserting safety measures potentially killing people. 

Improve character. think folks go motorcycle rallies within walking distance? Low mortality rate atm unlike countries, protests streets causing chaos Coupled effective vaccine, sounds real good. fully agree shit show there. politicians citizens handled whole ordeal astonishingly selfish way bottom ones paying it. I'm thankful someone different position different vantage situation able acknowledge hardships many facing currently. Hilariously enough, skill many have, shown.

As offer, truly appreciate gesture, must kindly refuse. I've much difficult positions adult life currently know navigate choppy waters. fortunate enough able keep roof head, transportation road, enough food table. could make request would say take whatever money ready put forth call local food bank around town. Food banks notoriously good making magic happen little funding, even small amount help build care packages families need. Volunteer work food banks also appreciated. Even going times changed entire perspective bottom line is.

You seem like really good person. hope rest day goes well stay healthy! That's case count, asking IFR... anyone comes me, I’m tired seeing ignorant fools claim Singapore copying Dutch company, Dutch somehow ‘first developing it’.

As another commenter stated:

The Dutch company managed achieve specificity rate 75% compared Singapore’s 90% [1]. 

The likely scenario governments started project Covid hit. utilised hospitals trials experiments Singapore merely finished first race.

[1] Correct, revoked times crisis necessary. projection roughly 97-102k 7 day average date ending 7th November (1.2 -1.25 week week growth rate). I'll also project 7 day weekly average deaths somewhere 969-1152 week ending 7th November, leaning toward lower end range. Actually given tests 100% accurate prevalence among population Slovakia assumed around 3% based results yesterday.

Also, official numbers deaths Slovakia probably correct, authorities counting Covid death case autopsy confirms patient died lung form Covid. AFAIK Covid also kills ways.

It interesting compare numbers deaths time year compared previous years. According data EU, spring 2020 EU around 250k excessive deaths compared previous years. Sweden Italy worst performs Slovakia actually outlier country fewer deaths previous years. goal get many asymptomatic spreaders population flatten curve. operation scheduled happen next weekend get almost everyone infected self-quarantine lessen pressure hospital system. Here’s text Governor’s website.  believe guarantee freedom travel within country unless misunderstanding comment? potentially thousand deaths. Think this... *had* biological weapon? US utterly defenseless it.

You damned sure Chinese Russians paying attention. It’s funny Sweden country tell don’t do. It’s almost like they’re saying measures all. Lmao Maybe. colder weather trumped anyway, hard tell correct understand lethality rate isn’t thing matters. even accounting hospital rates covid still high. Still way 95%. It’s careful balancing act containing covid destroying way life. easy situation. feel people charge Slovakia anywhere near population US, fact get done available resources astounding, shameful US following suite. look scientific papers it, say shown case needs study.

It sound pretty likely, though. Lots places require doctors note, 2-3 days call outs. nto verify sick verify healthy enough get back work. 

Requiring doctors note single sick day stupid. insane ask someone might contagious go doctors office doctor say, yup sick note. spread illness wasted 2-3 hours could spend bed resting get better. Thanks Sounds like sanity masks beginning crack.... say were. said I'd take manufacturer claim grain salt independent validation.

Souls Day. everybodys Halloween go? Vandalized Looted hell what? shortage rumors UK weekend. Thank reply.

I dont understand country mass testing opportunity like this, negative number false negatives high.

This amazing, optimistic this. Jackass. Like anyone administration position offer advice countries. They’d smart look opposite do. people spreading disease without even showing symptoms pretty significant get ""out picture"" even Anti-gen tests catch 2/3 positive cases (1/3 get false-negative). help us flatten curve goal operation. government changing laws comes in. need support mainly food, univercity fees &amp; univercity housing. exist regardless part time job not. duration covid19 lockdowns government find solution. log reduction.... Canadian pains see Americans enshrine constitution like this. 

The founding fathers really messed up. Holding rallies certain leaders continue belch “we’ve turned corner,” “doctors scamming system,” helping situation. enough people vaccinated (roughly 60-70% entire population) actually bring us comfortable level herd immunity even efficacy isn’t 100% vaccine, still provide comfortable amount antibodies disease widespread. I’m sure source you’re getting herd immunity isn’t possible covid-19, certainly like infectious disease we’ve able achieve herd immunity (Measles, Rubella, Mumps.) That’s say diseases never ever pop up, vaccination odds widespread problem extremely minimal. biggest hurdle come 2021 educating enough population take reach comfortable level herd immunity protection. Disappointed rudeness regardless gain immunity virus become clear vast majority people far reinfected, even sense get ""infected"" carry it. Thursday morning one minute past midnight, non-essential shops [which includes - limited - car showrooms, electrical stores, travel agents, betting shops, tobacco vape shops, clothing shops], well pubs, bars, restaurants England forced close doors least December 2, although could However, whilst many industry got creative last time allowed customers buy freshly poured pints takeaway product, permitted time Yesterday, Prime Minister announced UK would spend next month lockdown curb spread virus bring rate infection down. sucks, I'm sorry. deserve splurge little order something really fancy.

Hence, scummy copycat. mention eat everything bagels without worrying poppy seeds stuck teeth. world.wide insight gain from.this? hoping we'd see high % indicating herd immunity. low % would also insight, except deaths 50 per million, means basically side stepped pandemic.

Weekend extra work - normal scheduled work, asked smart-assy US bla bla...

I really care couples know, whether lose work go work, talking going work scheduled days, weekend extra paid ones. someone fires show show up, complain.

A bit salty talk context get called out, eh?

Right douche, know, OP comment comment back context on, ""correcting"" whether needed go extra weekend work even covid possitive, basically correcting ""judgement"" someone risk lives. Grow up. 

Your body combat pathogen, bounce you. closed bars restaurants little two weeks ago expect effect number cases. think number positive tests dropping well. Sigh, would nice, dream here, we're back lockdown again. live Germany Nobody actually plans anything similar now. however interesting sort effect project bring. proves positive see others follow suit. Antigen tests antibody tests though? wasn’t. Read two comments see distinguishing factor. Singapore managed achieve sufficient larger margin accuracy Dutch. mean congratulations mean long term strategy stupid. Forgot /s (I think?) They're kinda making go bit situation constantly changing. second round scheduled next weekend, places low % positive cases might excluded. 4 regions hit hardest already tested 2nd time week.

At borders people crossing either show EU approved PCR test also get tested border.

Slovakia purchased 13 million Ag tests, indication left could used test individual regions number cases high situation gets hand maybe retest entire population again.

The point eradicate virus country entirely, isolate many positive people possible order flatten curve help healthcare system well economy (otherwise we'd go total lockdown like rest Europe doing) also get point possible track trace contacts new cases quarantine order prevent kind massive spread right now.

The Slovak healthcare system north country already limits curve new cases Slovakia potential even steeper Czechia situation completely control.

Also worth noting negative result weekend gives freedoms like going shopping non-essential items traveling different regions, lot measures remain place now. Gatherings 6 people forbidden, masks ave worn times, restaurants pubs offer food drinks go outdoors etc. Mask up. go store needed. Bring hand sanitizer social distance. WE, power slow spread. Forgot /s (I think?) November vaccine approved think able start mass vaccinations December? Maybe December 2021 they're lucky. Wrong buddy, brainwashed Murdoch trash? Maybe try watching actually well-researched journalism change, unless actually like misinformed? stupid people, *mean* stupid people. long someone else getting stepped crushed, happy satisfied it’s happening them.  Gotcha. sooner, better. Even die, they'll still suffer, long term. Tons great ale available bottles, it’s British style real ales bad fit. American style ales (most better UK ales imo) perfectly ok drink bottled. Don’t ask New England style ales British real ale pubs though, it’s apparently appreciated old England.

Jokes aside: thought pubs closed entirely? try stay open serve takeout food? Remind Me! 7 days wonder allowed open Pint delivery business? Kind like ice cream truck. Call pint van. Play cool music drive street people run buy pint. 3rd time??!? feel bad health care workers. Hang there. agree people spoke helped contact trace, combined better company policies, things could safer. Fauci idiot. needs shut already. Every vaccine viral infection possibility causing reactions. Sunday 25th October 10K cases. No, people forget. United STATES America like country made multiple countries. federal government control response state level. 10th Amendment guarantees power, Governors control power, good reason. Especially US one size fits solution. needs ever. line similar reports around UK, experts saying. tentative optimism could approved vaccine end year, right there's plan that. mean restrictions gone January, mean best case scenario, vaccine could help save lives coming winter. relevant article Scientific American regarding immune enhancement various vaccines: results overall mixed, recent studies linked flu vaccines—as well vaccines—with lower COVID-19 risk. two papers, one published journal Vaccines September Journal Medical Virology June, researchers found COVID-19 rates lower regions Italy higher percentages adults aged 65 older received flu vaccine. preprint paper released July, **researchers Mayo Clinic biomedical computing company nference found adults received vaccines flu, polio, chicken pox, measles-mumps- rubella (MMR), Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib), hepatitis B, pneumococcal disease past five years less likely test positive novel coronavirus people received line, vaccines may give generalized benefit ramping immune system fight viruses. Vitamin d3 also showing benefits. objectively misinformation I'm really shocked cool putting there. Lockdowns working people want open early.

It's like taking antibiotics stopping regiment finished. bronchitis suffering keep going unless stick 7 day regiment.

Also, noticed, entire world burning fire. Correct Yeah Fauci known conservative estimates. near common knowledge now. know vaccine comes world snap back normal, Fauci literally give estimate like scientist can't give wrong estimates. thing happened 18 months vaccine approval timeline. things legally required, never otherwise? family story chased burly biker Australia quite while... could return wallet dropped. 

They absolutely feel love Australia would probably live could. :) champ gave stats literally less 0.1 percent chance three phase 3 moment fail since want cling little chance guest would patheitc technically development since justification SARS. Current estimate broad availability April-June 2021  get virus shops, definitely get mask, outside, 5minute human contact thag doctor.

If actually follow instructions is, fault test's. problem populism vs authoritarianism really

Being authoritarian **telling** people makes unpopular certain subsect population, countries popularity leader important large enough group bad decisions made people like better surprised. know someone tested positive husband/child never tested positive. stayed home minimal contact two still never got it. say taken seriously, definitely should, weird things happen. ""Ben Shapiro""""""""""..hahahahhahahahahaahahaaa...how ironic thats guys last name took Trumps SAT's him!  think pandemic us acting weird. Whatever stance pandemic feeling stressed want rant shoot message. guess statements true virus’s main intent depopulate earth it’s effective it??? vaccine, case. go well, done multiple times population scale, first time someone China it. (although China using PCR whereas antigen, still better nothing)

Having said that, no, countries follow, competent enough follow would done already. master's degree make automatically smart. Atleast feel smart getting degree, motivation study. also noted British govt rescue fund put work lockdown. leaving citizens creek, unlike countries. Several European countries already this. Greece, Finland Slovenia top head. Earth people sub keep referring ""Europe"" sort single blob unified approach Iceland Cyprus. way Thank you, appreciate comment. love festing holidays used first get everyone together I'm trying avoid unmitigated disasters. sure miss group higs laughing without mask I'd like keep safe :( part worries itll blow I'll look like paranoid reason, logically know I'm safe. got this! Let's get Good News flair here, mods 2 years online learning would epic disaster children. Why? 'dog-ate-my-homework' crap. vaccine? Hundreds millions 'doses' useful work. vaccine, case. 

Very simple. ...I never said anything vaccine. original comment wasn’t phrased well, seem confused. Lockdowns *do* work. 

The point lockdowns Covid prevent health services overwhelmed. prevent people mixing spreading virus, reduce number people ending hospital.

The Covid focus much numbers dead true issue number hospitalizes, number require ICU support. Sure ""only"" hundred might die day - ones recover days/weeks even months taking hospital bed problem. ones suffering ongoing health issues. adding number usual numbers coming accidents illnesses.

If significant number people refuse take pretty simple measures required slow spread, option left force to.  false negatives think they're fine take less precautions negative test result? Especially become symptomatic figure flu. 

Those people easily potential superspreaders many negative tests nationwide give false sense security. types tests known still inaccurate COVID. think surprised calm organized people Facebook social media paints general public. dummies commenting conspiracy driven bullshit every PM's, President's coronavirus related post small VOCAL group Slovakia. people completely normal, thinking humam beings.

Also dummies totally dummed opposition's mission turn everyone Matovic order gain voters. Imagine still Pellegrini even Fico. would Czech Republic, 10x worse now. think playing (or adding to) joke - sound like disagreeing you. That's garbage study, takes median high-quality large sample randomized studies like ENE-COVID small biased samples like infamous Santa Clara study (which Ioannidis also co-author on). also know storms coming future. Better keep umbrella somewhere handy next one hits. Dear heavens. hand-pulled pint real ale isn’t comparable anything purchased bottle.  Texas usually BEST something. WAY GO TEXAS!!!!!!!! wear masks KKK rallies, grocery store????? Wow. That's fantastic. Best luck there! can't eradication without closing borders. UK would better suppression plan Ala South Korean China Australia. think what's realistic country. Also, Melbourne 720 cases day took 3 months get zero. would probably locked severely 6-7 months get cases even close 0. mention everyone getting financial support time, UK afford half year? also keep borders closed intrastate well, one Manchester could go Liverpool on. personally consider 6 months, point short 2 month lockdown would useful setting workable longterm mitigation plan.

You missed boat timely eradication new lockdown set better testing capacity, workable social restrictions, mask mandates on. mean, Slovakia mass testing whole country, might better example follow. One thing wasnt mentioned - Austria Hungaria also kindly provided healthcare proffesionals helped testing, personally tested Austrian team. Thank Lmao beyond dense little bro point manufacturing part guy talking big issue hundreds millions doses currently made. Remember, we're November. fact second time mean portrays, particularly since PM (like almost every European head government) promised avert second lockdown costs. would impossible test whole nation PCR. labs maximum capacity less 20k daily PCRs, would take four months test amount people, would capacity left suspected cases.

Our capacity bottlenecked number testing stations recently, bottlenecked lab capacities opening dozens new testing places. testing stations deliver PCR swabs across whole country daily evaluate labs close capacity left. Sure :). know are. God, wish they'd make mind. They've spent last however long saying lockdown going happen tier system managing things local level way go, change direction last possible moment, probably harm good meantime. Wales, midst lockdown fuming fact could part coordinated effort, north Scotland fuming theyve short-changed government compensation available, London fuming they've working really hard try manage return business (with allowances) work set back months little gains. main goal piss many people totally possible, they've definitely succeeded. wanted achieve anything else, think class failure.

Rant over, thanks letting get system. MS, suspect Mono teenager. mimics knows, neurologists idea. immune system starts attacking body, sucks. Another thing found helpful take smaller bites chew much longer. What? I’m person/poster responding to. Genuine question, doctor healthcare. Doesn’t flu spread circumstances, though? even it’s “Covid season” circumstances indoors low humidity flu spreads, Covid will, too? England legally “country.” literally means word. 3rd time home countries use word “country” mean de facto countries. It’s Brits use describe first national divisions. independent sovereign nations arguing ignorant situation. 

Texas legally state. England legally “country” literally exact amounts power governments. Texas pass laws applies Texas, England lol. Matter fact Texas sovereign country recently England. union crowns happened England, Wales, Scotland ceased sovereign nations. united one larger nation. kept terminology “countries” first national divisions. It’s hard concept 

Hence Scotland INDEPENDENCE vote years ago lol. Well state government actually sues cities everytime try mask mandate lockdown figures. every man here. die, die. not. mean actual growth same, artificially masked high numbers first wave. said hundreds millions doses right cried said objectively do. 

Doses vaccine, right? So....where it? Oh yeah, that's right: IT. 

Please, try explain science using so-called 'popular science.' work. already stated think party stupid it. defend right one. OP mistaken could literally die every time drive car. lot people US think act way. wear masks, take precautions, go lives. Even us things often told we’re reckless enough protect others. people want get mad anything essentials. travelled American South, Texas Bible / sun belt one big walking pre-existing condition.

I mean every population pudgier be. US South basically land metabolic syndrome, almost one actually fit, almost everyone overweight minimum.

Basically populations taking least seriously, also populations inherent risk. man's voters going die droves covid, care. anyone else relatively unaffected pandemic? I'm essential worker life pretty much unchanged. able afford rent area. lucked able buy house cash sold mother's house.

I truly feel anybody trying afford rent addition everything else. house quite wanted, long pay property taxes (which minimal) nobody take away us. lot post, comments. First, think everyone agrees less fortunate always always currently getting short end stick crisis. think saying poor kids rich kids ""both groups"" really oversimplification. people income levels situations country. losing skills, I'd guess different muscle. 8 weeks inactivity weightlifter loses lot, 8 months linear. hit baseline size, muscle memory makes come back incredibly fast lift weights again. would actually memory different? actually forgot kids always take 3 month break. Would kids geniuses year round school? Unlikely. 
 pandemic hit, claim 200 kids NY died reaction months clearing covid. risk gone? know kids spread it, question risk spread, killing teachers, killing people community greater loss person learning year. fair question debate. said different post, maybe answer send back non english speaking students without means internet access. think would criticizing point wouldnt allowed. one answers seems. Yeah Cells produce antibodies 100% lockdown long enough would result active cases infected could identified put specifically designed isolation room, negative pressure jazz

It would take slightly longer 2 weeks even living house may keep virus spreading other, 4 people could *4 incubation periods + 4 active illness + 4 infectious-post-infection* infected time illness consecutively instead concurrently Fauci changed mind something eight months ago he’s obviously communist hoax!! Kind like original Thanksgiving Given poster made quite boasting statement vaccine, yeah, he/she needs justify he/she said instead using trolls intimidate ask. already know someone tested negative wife tested possitive. Safe say he's also positive got caught antigen test. claimed go work anyway estra weekend pay. hate people.
(I know personally, works bf's dad, can't snitch) according numbers (i check them) germany 0,006% positive cases relative 83M inhabitants 0,020% deaths relative test numbers. 
here written US testing significantly germany, explains that, according numbers US 0,027% positive cases relative 328,2M inhabitants 0,025% deaths relative cases - similar Germany.

germany continually rising test numbers gap 0,006% 0,027% positive cases surely shrink time.

nonetheless none numbers suggest dangerous pandemic justifies limiting basic human rights free breathing, free moving, free gathering, free market ignoring parliaments public discussion, censoring critique governing via decrees, usual dictatorships. 

Since know wich source used get numbers, go ahead extract source numbers Sweden compare US Germany. Sweden never mandatory mask law full lockdown overall significant less ""corona-laws"" rest developed countries. get cognitive dissonance looking numbers. Well, Germany regulations people stay home, like pay short term work. right companies 50 employees close partial lockdown get 75% last years November income national relief fund. Companies 50 employees apply European relief fund. lot companies, like mine, mostly remote work. Others like plumbers etc considered essential, stay open, maybe short term work. indeed know exactly. Technically possible (and spring 2.5 months) almost every child could stay home. considered necessary rn. Dude lol even know arguing said hundreds millions doses right cried said objectively do. trying tell hundreds millions doses

I never, NEVER SAID completed vaccine. NEVER. point. said HUNDREDS MILLIONS DOSES. said NO. clearer?

noob  Fauci fired unfettered access time media. Right he’s pulling punches. Unless high risk COVID complications live area that's experiencing surge would delay getting cleaning.

Neither dentist staff want anyone get infected careful.

I'd also say numbers area low I'd try get sooner rather later case there's uptick. analogy, mask seatbelt. doesn’t mean stop socializing people (driving car), means pay attention reasonable safety precautions it. Wouldn’t great post-pandemic stopped accepting tens thousands flu deaths per year normal kept paying attention hard-earned lessons protect health everyone? doesn’t mean constant mandatory mask-wearing, you’re sick large public group. others say “I probably already it, wouldn’t know.” [English future please provide English translation required rule 5. cells important clearing virus infected. Antibodies important preventing getting infected again. W la libertà Give every child’s family elementary school age children $5000 per month stay home home school duration pandemic. Let everyone else go lives everything else stays open elementary schools. Lol Biden clean house like trump has. people can’t touch jusges really need think parents allowed eat bad foods exercise, no? Lots kids lose parents unhealthy habits. usually ""quarantined"" anyway go public much fear getting virus lot people testing sites, e.g.my grandma left house 6 months safe say negative, going much also virus spreaders. lot old people same, especially villages, family neighbors bring food. harder cities many pensioners live alone nobody help them.
Tbh reason hope plan first place rural country, people live villages also fast get tested. 

However thing absolutely confuses fact without test can't go doctors'. Investments actual vaccines. Jesus Christ, kid, learn read. 
Pfizer's vaccine still trials. Show press release Pfizer's vaccine completed PHASE III TRIALS. put caps perhaps read comprehend. 
BTW, still see peer reviewed paper scientists actually found COVID-19 vaccine. Given even know I'm talking about, really shows state American educational system. That’s horrible. one boycotting. Watch one amazon returns! Nobody likes snitches Wow impressively condescending comment lol We’ll waiting guys slip. Corona stay. phrasing poor. states per capita low. agree it’s false equivalency compare America large country uk. trying stay anonymous Reddit wonder there's reliable way determining much week-over-week change due new spread vs. false negatives initial round testing. We've stayed in, canceled plans, seen friends family. 

Maybe change that. Guess said tired. Almost every vaccine does.

Also, knew anything vaccines, know rushed (especially Oxford passed safety trials pandemic). I'm convinced caused periodic droughts, cyclones, floods bushfires. Even urban Australians directly experience them, creates certain culture codependence. We're also premier example nanny state. Guess didn't? locked down. Oh light years took exponential growth we'd colonised galaxy already. non-contact thermometers designed check body temperature. Washington, PA. city really different compared surrounding areas. look political map. Pittsburgh largely Democrat basically rest western PA heavily Republican. time stops novel coronavirus. give context (as someone Korea), masks mandatory really big deal here, 99% people ""daily activities"" wear even mandatory. Like, months since I've seen single person department store without mask, even mandatory.

Night clubs hand... I'd even dream going one year, I've seen pics - night clubs Halloween celebrations seem quite non-compliant people. we'll see goes next week so. Sure, statistics important correcly assess risk.. think we'd benefit lot people understood I’m sorry. You’d think people would least stay masked medical facility!

I’m retail surprisingly nearly visitors following business’ mask rules. Pity bosses don’t require kids 5 people claim “medical exemption” though. Lots little kiddies here, many actually masked, eight probably fake medical claims far. yes, thirtysomething dude carrying forty pound toddler around, feeling you’re lying unable breathe mask... elderly aunt advanced COPD plethora issues fine one. immune system kep active alive constantly fed small doses virus.
Instead going hide away totally germ free environment immune system become lazy.
The encounter flu sooner later instead mild virus -it kill you
Yup - good plan.... Absolutely. colorful cloth masks new favorite fashion accessory. people struggle handle reality/the truth

feelings priority objectivity USA! USA! USA! say face. acting like assholes. Period. Understandable seen public quite bit. Typical toxic masculinity - man strong, woman weak. Strong man need mask - kill virus streams testosterone.

BTW - man wear mask consistently public except low risk areas. restrictions place recently lifted. Come on, must seen articles elderly isolated, unable meet family friends on.

It draconian lock up. Yeah. Would also preferred wording ""there recommendations masks"" rather ""masks recommended"", since big deal frequently misunderstood foreign media before.

Or maybe media like stir things up? :)  Proof....hmmmm. came life Dutch “out there”. Almost identical name, website, value claim. (visible) track record. Circumstantial evidence. enforced. also complicated say people cant see parents children legal sense. Singapore government least credit Breathomix works even Singapore actually contribute more. let older people die? Thanks. think could argued mask usage, type mask, potential viral load. good news, trying assess 100% flu shot nothing else. Getting one regardless though pathetic ineffective American government effective public health measures Exactly... Ooo accelerated big word local pharmacy already saying offering vaccine .... recording hold. quite possible thousands doses day approval.

This planning different producing them. Logistical distribution national scale near simple making be. family member working working 7 days week, 3am 7pm (not allowed say even know much beyond basics). Depending vaccine could serious logistical challenges. Pfizer / Moderna vaccines need stored cold temperatures (around -90f). type freezers going local CVS, standard freezer trucks suffice. omitted part met flew home tested positive. someone consistently show Fridays schedule Fridays. fired excessive absences abusing sick leave think assumptions probably going proven correct. thing happened family cousin tested positive outbreak nursing home worked. daughter husband never came Covid despite living together. Like protect getting sick first place masking. Even countries top struggling now. definitely resurgence going on. object permanence kinda person ya?

You’ll get ‘em next year sport Cough... Luxembourg... Cough. According Minister Defense.

Maybe even UK, that's questionable, check this: TX fucked man, LBK right getting slammed COVID cases ones gives half flying fuck, amount people I’ve give shit wearing mask insane weird. I'm old enough dead sibling polio outbreak. Dead. Six months old. People dumb. I’m Ottawa. I’m definitely including services I’m saying. However, I’ve never sort store restaurant doesn’t accept tap exception Walmart. happening everywhere Western World. Yet say American thing ❤️ think rate we’re going might peak Thanksgiving. guess really depends “over it” people though. study done tested positive already. live foothills Denver 11yr old also remote. keep getting emails cases middle school. Makes feel justified keeping home. 1) don't.

2) matter, maybe they're copycats, maybe none them, one them, relevant, race.

Indeed none, thus never said copycat.

I never said Singapore testing. Netherlands tons cases, means lot people test (8k positive per day pop 17 mil.) within country. yahoo.com may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

He's done part area expertise people listen. 1) going regular doctor would require regular doctor, took same-day appointments, really much thing cheaper insurance plans. Also, lot insurance cover first $2500 even $5k health needs, $100 copays, ""having insurance"" mean much doctor's note level problems. Also, ""urgent care"" often hospital, chain neighborhood clinic offers flat rate mandated medical tasks like school sports physicals vaccinations certain testing. would go needed stitches cast, they're place safer wallet hospital, four digit bills next nothing routine.

2) really talking every Friday nice beach days. people complain light paychecks they're paid days work. Germans Americans different people; right increased unemployment, there's people looking work.

3) understanding said old co-worker time, something like 20% German adults permanently workforce pickier hiring, lost job, nobody would hire ever again. people I'm talking ""sick"" every Friday would probably class Germany. Prehaps light recent events, US also conclude better bribe class generous welfare rather deal political implications approaches. Yeah, used example regarding low margins. lot industrial (less foot traffic) businesses outside core don’t accept tap (wholesaling companies, mechanic shops, paint specialty stores, tailoring shops, etc) schools closed World War 2, closure schools various parts London, example, [lead serious took years massive reform educational system recover from. Many phase 3 trials finished enrollment, others even close. much doubt significant rollout vaccine summer/fall 2021. Also trials finished enrollment brand new platform could see FDA wanting slightly data making call it. Hopefully I'm wrong think super optimistic expect things look much different average person spring. Outliers happening.

The idea restaurants help get economy going. understand exactly that. 'Same schools.

As working class parents, one blaming sending children school, people unable work home go work pay bills/feed families on. complete red herrings designed obscure reality situation.

The reality situation first large outbreak around end August 'round 300 people decided crowd workmen's club specifically told hours drinking karaoke. Cases also traced back people returning holiday self-isolating. Reports detail far less half people told self-isolate fact that. People keeping distance people places shops, pubs on. supermarket yesterday lass tannoy telling people utilise social distancing one took blind bit notice: carnage. people keep saying government blame people able grasp 2 metres follow it, we'll never get unless saved vaccine.

Aye, people, circumstance, avoid situations risk catching/spreading virus. disputed. But, boat loads people willfully ignoring basic, simple principles made loud clear desperately needed contain spread time time. deserting safety measures putting people risk want people thank ?

 - immunity means virus still enter body body combat it. 

If get new exposure, white bloodcells attack virus much effectively that, unfortunately, mean cannot carry it. Neither prevent people getting sick it. 

Imagine breathe dosis virus 5seconds later breathe another person breathe in. **evidence** next person spread get virus white bloodcells?Don't act naïve. aware virus real particles immunity means body kill particles *faster*.

The virus bounce you, fly away avoid either. immunity lowers risk spreading infection mean able pretend like collaborate together people avoid spread. get different strains again, mostly protected whatever one strain got initially. 

I glad mention dose one gets effect, coronaviruses trigger antibody dependent enhancement. basically means enough antibodies *completely* coat spike proteins virus, order antibodies work. get high dosis virus body enough antibodies *completely* coat virus right away, virus use antibodies disguise enter cells easier. stop finding reasons deserting safety measures. completely well proven smallpox disease. coronaviruse disease, takes virus make sick second time, virus strains mutate enough evade immunity / tricks body bloodcells enough antibodies prevent reinfection. 


You want return ""normal"" life, completely understand that. avoid situation now, everybody waited non essential things one year. wait vaccine available amount people takes kill eachother, lost many people pathogen already. 

Keep safety measures times deserter Please. may sick recovered already, lot people recover already lot going die well. 

That politely able talk initial comment made here. bit odd though. live Tucson people wearing masks, state much back business. wonder Arizona still showing less case rise 39 states? nurses blatantly telling wife stay fuck home houses either. city bars restaurants packed. sold us ....And? notice sidestepped question regular testing instead played ""In muh experienz"" card, though means much someone (a) knows science; (b) works educational institution. 

Guess what? doesn't. tough time explaining anecdotal, frankly fallacious, observation hard data. numbers lie: Texas, Florida, Alaska, Colorado, California, France (yes, know another country), India (ditto), Canada, Italy ONE thing common: schools open. stated below, I'm even sure Bingham charge anything vaccine related. think downplaying vaccine hopes support Tories' flailing lockdown plans. Also multigenerational households. live almost every house three four families living one place. much one wants protect themselves, live house 10 people. Everyone block it. one got sick, spread like wildfire vulnerable. lot us obese, hypertension diabetes, there's lot vulnerable. restriction movement past week, limit number fresh infections. anyone comes me, I’m tired seeing ignorant fools claim Singapore copying Dutch company, Dutch somehow ‘first developing it’.

My comment never stated that, reaction someone claimed probably scam, showed example know Dutch company managed achieve specificity rate 75% compared Singapore’s 90% [1]. 

If going use Dutch source, please cite correctly. never stated specificity 75%. said cases tested, able say certainty 75% cases coronavirus. means 75% people instance could've gotten line given test beforehand (the test PCR, confirm results given breathalyzer correct, device able rule coronavirus infection certainty 75 percent cases...The quarter test subjects' results uncertain, sent cotton swab test. 

But taking account test positivity. tested Amsterdam. Two weeks ago test positivity Amsterdam around 20%. means of, let's say 100 people show test, 80 people tested negative. group, test able get 75 80 negative people. That's accuracy ~94%. means 75 people could've gotten line early, 5 negative people would've tested anyways 20 people tested positive PCR test.

So cite source correctly. I'm trying win argument see race. clearly Singapore merely finished first race. work construction NYC, two sites company shutdown two separate positive cases, includes site working at. site shutdown one day. disinfect? told so, though didn’t notice smell, residue, etc. next day returned. admit I’m unfamiliar disinfect large areas. 

The thing I’ve noticed that, site everyone tends wear masks improperly, all, unless they’re job requires one (like sanding compound such). 

Also, since mostly everyone able return soon, likely got rapid test accurate positives, negatives seemingly need verified. Also, correct I’m wrong, picks antigens, likely won’t detected/produced within ~&lt;6 days exposure. Therefore, possible someone positive without testing so, return work day later infecting others. understand reasoning: can’t wait around test need make money, job done certain date, things lawmakers might enforce, well general contractors. 

This first hand, anecdotal experience, things don’t change it’s probably going get lot worse cell immunity protective immunity. circulating antibodies particular antigen, race virus cells kill infected cells disease spread. still going take couple weeks generate IgG antibodies get virus again. literally said Walmart’s don’t tap.

Literally every place city tap. like said, restaurants require press keypad tip tapping. 20 year old bad mental health issues missing youth college experience.. social distancing developing severe depression go long. I’d rather take precautions since work busy grocery store anyways. don’t know article right don’t feel fair people 40 live like 2+ years. don’t even many elderly relatives see care ones know less social distancing me. Faake news, looks like MACA rally /s. Take moderator bot. official figures \~100 daily deaths (pop 267 million) bs then? Super TL;DR: met person, later coughed video. European officials aware COVID cannot transmitted via Zoom. good questions, don’t think anybody answers. We’ve mass-educating entire populations hundred years, nobody knows happens huge chunk cohort remove school warning support. fear result lot long term economic damage three million kids, fear long term economic damage them, society, greater total damage done COVID... proof anybody proof *won’t* long term damage done. 

I suspect damage might permanent, though, least lot them. idea we’ll reintegrate kids back classroom setting long absence, especially older ones. think lot kids lost education good. going lot Americans 6th grade education less competing jobs Americans college degrees twenty years now. 

But sincerely hope right wrong. . Awesome.

But I'm sorry, Britain, EU starts review vaccine now, fuck cant FDA start? Everything brains. wear mask Georgia. Although, rarely get go anywhere. tropical storm made things tough power three days. keep resisting urge go restaurants etc. take vaccine unless want turn monkey! wonder many children want 2 Halloweens next year. One Halloween, one birthdays. \[As long risky then, unlike now.\] Lest anyone confused what's discussed, fabric uses copper ingredients kill virus, intended make safer sorts masks. far border? opened 21:30. free everybody. bring ID card. even need passport health insurance ID card, national ID card. ask telephone number. southern towns villages Slovakia people speak Hungarian, so, communication issue. coming back Hungary show result test. moat kids generally ignore Roman Empire running water, can't get native people 2,000 years later. Unbelievable.  Exactly. guess cases increasing fairly consistently. We're probably getting settled vertical increase part curve. event lives. Something read fake don’t know. Exactly. know single study received mainstream press used NP gauge response. black people access emergency rooms middle class white people.

I think true, saw president, got world class treatment due position. Absolutely hospitals [""VIP"" rich famous people receive higher levels care middle low class patients.

Even case, emergency room, last line defense save life. Everything leading moment probably different. poor, likely worse nutrition (e.g., ""food deserts""), worse working conditions (e.g., Hispanics working meat packing plants), lack access preventative saying poverty doesn’t hurt exacerbate it, don’t think it’s simple.

That point well, simple. partial biological aspect vs. social economic effects? original comment, African American death rates influenced lot things, said ""simple"". first assumption biological difference?

Unless carefully design experiments analyses rule economic differences, hard determine root cases public health disparities. However, CDC suggest social economic status playing role systemic health social inequities put many people racial ethnic minority groups increased risk getting sick dying COVID-19....  increasing evidence racial ethnic minority groups disproportionately affected COVID-19. [2], [3], [4], [5], [6] Inequities social determinants health, poverty healthcare access, affecting groups interrelated influence wide range health quality-of-life outcomes Dude blatantly false info. making up. Look qatar study. tried see could get covid carrier rate people reinfected 0.01. even ONE percent.

I'm definitely correct here.

24 reinfections hundreds millions cases. Nope lol Walmarts don’t accept tap. Also, business didn’t accept tap either. Tap adds 0.5% total transaction charged merchant bank. you’re operating 4% margin groceries (or even 15% businesses) bank charges 2% already taking credit card, 0.5% huge. That’s many businesses don’t enable tap part POS machine package. Interesting. odds infection based population based? question throw idea people get flu vaccine less likely put risk infection risk settings? risk tolerance issue effecting severity anything vaccine? Long term plan? think probably... like literally every virus? exception Covid past 90 days. around 13 000 peiple recovered Covid far.

Might work people mild deficiency, sounds like recipe problems would enough. I'm also still waiting precise Article says absolute free traveling Union. I've seen ways. even odder one see younger person drive much older one (presumably parent grandparent) store, younger one masks, older one not. Here's idea, Grandma wear mask store protect (and others), drive Grandma store. Drive store Grandma's shopping list, get shit, take her. entire thing boggles mind. very, very, rare, also illegal many states, electoral college voter break popular vote. threat overblown going happen. White House spokesman called Fauci's remarks ""unacceptable,""

That's strange, I've seen lot ""unacceptable"" coming white house Fauci's office.

It also seems attacking figure Americans respect eve election is.. wisest strategy. think US one big state, instead number smaller states joined union. Many states US smaller populations Slovakia larger... certainly kind testing without needing federal government. issue US is.. political say least..which makes sad. laws aren’t enforceable unless you’re caught complying Yes, makes lot sense, thank Yeah. Like, planning logistics. easy delay operation, hard accelerate ready. isnt new york’s fault ct mass jersey texas. Eachh state must rules. want remain carefree issue. werent bad idea, everyone thought place reserved them, sites overwhelmed. think it'll work forever? I'm honestly really disappointed America. Like, come on, we're better Oh, Wikipedia? LMAO. 

How actual fucking 9 Migration Importation Persons States existing shall think proper admit, shall prohibited Congress prior Year one thousand eight hundred eight, Tax duty may imposed Importation, exceeding ten dollars Privilege Writ Habeas Corpus shall suspended, unless Cases Rebellion Invasion public Safety may require it.


Maybe New Yorkers actually improve public school education instead using bribes arm-twist less populated states bidding? That's contact tracing comes Trump correct. Vaccine coming 2-week harsh lockdowns time hospitals nearly overrun (and hospitals nearly overrun) best strategy opposed months-long medium soft lockdowns followed even lockdowns. 

When creating health-related policies, important psychologists board predict compliance population. think you’re naive think you’ll magically able stop getting Australia again. said first time quarantine would magically work, didn’t it’ll fail again.

It’s globally endemic disease now. It’s going come eventually, it’s matter time. completely cut forever. 

Even vaccine Australia virgin territory it, you’ve got built immunity all. recovered. 

However, since anecdotal, also note “everyone know” consists 16-35 year olds, work lightly physical essential jobs, generally good health. 

And lot testing bias well. know *lot* people writing symptoms things going go get tested unless they’re sick need medical attention they’ve ordered go employers displaying “classic” covid symptoms. Lots us care other. media hammers relentlessly selfish stupid ignoring essential workers jobs everyday, charities working food banks, etc created help people. Thank you.

If *keeping* people going lives fine Enforcement there's LOCK lockdown.

Tell everyone that's essential stay home. Make Essential mean medical, pharmacy, food. Pay everyone staying home send care packages Essential workers well hazard pay.

And virus population, keep significant fine anyone using mask properly outside home. essentially COVID specific. lot things COVID viruses well non-medical community doesn’t realize this. I’m sorry go :( sure need it. hope too,its sad,uncomfortable, unsafe,depressing environment,for children well, nobody forced work like this,especially safely home.

Makes 0 sence put people building pass get virus,zero logic whatsoever, think morally wrong. depend electricity indigenous people living underdeveloped rural areas. Canada similar problems along sad idea also supposed guarantee equivalent healthcare people choose live boondocks. right thing combat covid-19 pandemic 2nd wave. needs examined US work agree suspicious choice name Singapore’s part. **technology device means mere copy**. It’s innovation ask me. 45 - 60 mins cut 60 seconds. That’s drastic increase efficiency. 

This would likely due different way screening virus. would copy commenters repeatedly tried claim? Pretty sure koreas case count low necessary Yeah that's still insane though. That's 16 hours 7 days week. can't imagine little free time. I'd going nuts. I'm fine however many hours 5-6 day stretch. Usually 10-12 hours day 5 days. get 2 day break. needed me. need time away go crazy. That's serious work ethic have. good cause too. People like hero's this. here. Cuomo full shit. New Yorkers, Texassans, Californistas, Floridians always blame everyone else pandemic, yet they're tourists keep flooding less populated areas bringing virus them. too, infrequently used employees know it. I've slowly training them. Friday interview, Dr Fauci pointed US heading tough times coronavirus, praised Joe Biden wearing mask.

That enough WH unleash Flying Monkeys. Should’ve mentioned sister (and likely mom well, pending test results) literally Covid positive right now. Yes quarantine program set less 2 days I'm sure learned nothing that. Chances better places even another break dealt with. I'm glad position compared places world. Geez. retreat it’s mom sister coming over. can’t imagine dealing 31 let alone 31. Fauci Gang Unite.

""Utah...people listening science reason""

Yeah raised it. Mormon doctrine trumps science. Even science said drinking green tea necessary fight virus, mormons would sit around dying leaders say drink it. wont mask unless Mormon prophet makes commandment, done that, even though, ironically, current Mormon prophet spent entire pre-prophesying career as--get this--a surgeon wore, guessed it, masks, every time operated patients Yep! Woke tons snap stories everyone partying, masks large gatherings. Extremely selfish world live in/ one cares anyone themselves. Sad...

I apologise ranting commenters suggesting Singapore copycat though it’s China simply ignorant me. deaths recovered? thought r/savedyouaclick actually say that, sorry.  Moreover, public health mentioned specific reason suspend habeas corpus articles. Unfortunately that’s relatively small holiday gathering family. It’s rarely enjoyable. anyone care someone else's comments are? upvote downvote whether someone agrees specific comment. agree one comment wrote disagree one I'll upvote one comment downvote rest. Considering bars restaurants biggest spreaders lockdown big effect Whatever government police do, need accept difference want, get. pushing public far, anti-lockdown protests riots defeat goal trying accomplish. You’d surprised. US government pretty much said moving pretending doesn’t exist anymore. means less people caring, cases guessed it: deaths. Jeez. point I'd fake nasty dry cough least get tested find out. symptoms probably decent sign infected, I'm sure least one would kind symptom, still. Would nice know sure. Unsourced comment 100+ upvotes, one witha source negative. Really makes think. fan cummings way lets keep facts straight. Germany outlier? chart diagram look Germany’s numbers half less it’s neighbors. Whether it’s numbers, hospitalizations deaths ever. It’s like don’t challenges. Loads lockdown/mask skeptics here. 

Unlike UK Germany decentralized. may work well enough languages awful Thai. (Not common language, mind you.) know may hard understand larger population makes know harder pull off. mean, assume we're still talking Biden Well.. nba bubble worked out.. 

Divide conquer, one piece time? want wear daily basis around friends family office. actually kind like idea continuing wear stores subway. actually find anonymity comforting. idea run store dressed like crap without makeup one going recognize anyway matter. I’ve seen lot NY/CT/MA/NJ/TX/OH/RI many plates tiny ass VT Town. see stuff like funny. Oh wanna protect state?! Cool. Get residents stop flooding one grocery store serves 7 towns. Vermonts numbers low dumb luck, tourist hotspot. Cases Numbers go death rate goes down. Well, awkward real start. I’m sure fuck else OP would like do. mobile? Like first time.... escaped form quarantine....

Do see I’m getting at? stats mean nothing old? unless stats today meaningless eyes. know stats work right?, joke.

2.2%, yeah many stats marked died directly covid, know people ventilators dying droves apparently... nope people ""tested positive"" within 28 days dying, symptoms could cold flu. Even heavily padded stats 2.2%

Show stats people directly dying this, since provided f all, sheep. 

Take away flu jab couple years we'll get accurate measurement close covid 19 flu deaths, give immune system years covid 19 we'll also see ""deadly"" virus compared flu. right say 2-3 oct 8th, doesnt count right?
thats 2-3 times flu vaccine. hopeful end date though people away likely rule break early on. know lockdown month try stick out. indefinite way likely care start know never take things CEO weight that’s prediction, mid November 

It really doesn’t matter you’re US first world country, means get figured 3-4 months (think abt flu vaccines) feel like you’re using RSVPs now, you’re probably concerned COVID Except one going there. New Yorkers heading south. Warm Weather limited restrictions. wonder why? wouldn’t people took seriously first place. ain’t gonna happen US people care wish death upon people share different opinion.. ‘Murica Agreed

I would also recommend Michael Osterholm’s podcast YouTube. also mostly spot regarding pandemic, he’s government speak freely, also empathetic guy. Great listen. updates weekly. Oh get you. first read headline skimmed “online” part, changed meaning completely. think redditors could better job headline writers. Damn. awful hours, especially 7 days week. Appreciate work they're though. duration around “time market”, light nearly identical names. 5 years vs 3 months there. Ready month vs Q1 next year. hey, really relevant - better!!! That's I'm glad 10 Downing St valiant, refusing give unscientific demands selfish Britainers. Oh true oops

Well hope anomaly something least tcell response good enough rid virus fast enough 😐 lived far Kenosha recently protests. friends lots photos video protesters masks on. Funny press avoided that. welding buildings shut let people inside die  ya go! know sarcasm, UK seeing different scenario US. lockdown applies England cases last 2 weeks 34 per 100,000. 20 US states level. significant portion states, including Northeast West Coast economic engines, still half level less even though they've seen uptick recently. 

An equivalent solution Johnson Trump administration pressured Governors highest spreading states shut non-essential activity. Unfortunately, none going want shit election, especially without government aid. 😂😂😂 thanks reccomendation. see much changed since pandemic started Actually (and learned this!) windows block UVB rays. help body produce vitamin D. However, screens don’t. So, sit front window glass shut = vitamin D. Sit front *screened* window glass open = vitamin D. 

I excited learn WFH front window screens, hopefully makes reduced amount time I’m outside now.

Thought would share I’m also post-menopausal woman beginning osteoporosis. Well yeah, live town close Sturovo, wouldnt long ride, girlfriend gets tested every two weeks, good indication think.

I thought would help us nation, really thank information, going tell friends live near me, maybe someone need free test. Jeff Bezos owns Washington Post it’s fucked there’s paywall No, that's strawman attempting build refuse admit US Americans general done anywhere near enough control spread virus primarily misinformation stemming one malicious group spouting exact drivel you.

Testing cause new cases. New cases come people like refusing follow basic virus containment measures. ""Our numbers bad we're testing much"" categorically false. numbers bad nothing control virus' spread. countries better numbers things control virus' spread. Hiding many cases someone claim ""solved COVID crisis"" mean new cases. Claiming places better numbers testing much irrelevant attempt distract fact suffering nation almost nothing control virus.

Until admit new infections cause positive test results stop implying opposite, spreading misinformation. admit virus control measures contain virus preventing people testing contain virus, spreading misinformation. Nothing else say relevant internalize facts. Nothing say relevant implies two facts important factors. least germs Must nice. US acting like compition get cases. actually is. look figure 1 paper, appear ~8% individuals make antibodies first place.  knew make effective lied prevent shortage. That's still lie. reason lie somehow make lie. trust people lie me. argument, personally trust Fauci. free hold contrary judgement. Honestly don’t care. Ethics. Treat like casualties war. Fix em regardless, worst case, send em home war’s over. agree many solutions cold chain, something already exists temperature. plan using dry ice storage get multiple days sure, wonder enough dry ice nation etc. saying logistical challenges vaccines make much different average flu shot. pandemic could good news turkeys. least, people celebrate thanksgiving much. Fry's foods (kroger) tap pay implemented. grocers do. Walmart tap pay either. 95% gas pumps tap pay. far behind. Neither they, there's argument made. They're contrarian Trump told be. everybody wearing proper N95 mask, could virtually re-open entire economy including schools work, without spread virus 

This true likely agree things COVID. 

That said, quoted statement definitely true likely everyone suddenly agreeing everything politically. Many people cannot even find proper N95 mask, know identify proper N95 masks improperly stamped knockoffs (I know would research feel comfortable it), N95 masks much expensive cloth masks. factor ability get *everyone* able afford, identify, locate N95 masks, PLUS wear properly touch faces. 

It *shouldn't* impossible ask people, Americans is. Actually, comment thread me, since made original comment. don’t care disagree, could constructive conversation provide evidence based response, could actually keep scrolling. O_o see, one think of, police mexico speak spanish, police states speak English, can't think another difference. Police suck abusive countries Obviously didn’t want people hoarding masks like toilet paper. there’s amazing thing called evidence appears something happens. it’s obvious whole world places masks used virus spreading less it’s bad thing change opinion. Changing opinions based science facts normal smart way behave person. smart person. allowed change mind faced new evidence. Nobody set ways forever. Australian response good locked region spiraling control brought outbreak control again?

Because that's what's happening many European countries, know point supposed be. Ireland currently lockdown fewer daily deaths Victoria locked (and cases already going down). Greece, Austria others.

The problem is, again, much much mean MUCH harder control inflows outflows Europe compared Australia. remember Bush years 🤨? OK....so question, different places like Vietnam? problem is, *a month short*. dates going end shifted (or worse yet, lockdown actually lifted planned, allowing virus spread like wildfire even greater extent), going induce flouting guidelines even more. think important people learn languages absolutely yes. Yeah! Warp speed baby! we're going higher higher :/ Nope. We're mourning you. point even mass testing everyday would 25k new cases every day I’m Atlantic Bubble cases, schools open precautions like masks older students, masks public spaces bus, frequent sanitizing hand washing, extra cleaning class cohort (meaning never mix classes.). cohorting, though, interesting effect. young students become tribal. trust other, want nothing children classes. another class passes near us - playground instant, one sure look say, ‘You aren’t allowed around us.’ go woods another class there, automatically head another corner woods play - one tries sneak see ‘others’. It’s different normal way children interacted school pre-Covid. temp required point care.

And they've already designed dry ice boxes transport temp. meant is, over, pandemic. I'm stating personally trust Fauci morally repugnant you? saying I'm allowed hold opinion someone contrary morally repugnant me. tell think. Yes. Pin still required. that's fair taxpayers.

You can't get say ""fuck taxes"" get bailed taxpayer money need something. Unless massive bank, case, yeah still fair agree that. forgot mention Cummings wife Covid 19 time. travelled across country, likely visited elderly parents (they staying cottage estate). I'm sure least questions get answered degree accuracy Lancet months now. huge task even small country like Slovakia. 40,000 people actively involved, including around 15k healthcare workers taking samples.

Slovakia struggled find sufficient medical staff last minute testing sites saved thanks 33 Austrian army doctors, 200 medical staff Hungary staff Czech hospitals across border well Slovak med students study CZE foreign Norwegian Icelandic students studying medicine Slovakia. Pin required every transaction USA. Impressed seem change now! Thank BBC, need objective media less clickbait things. Christ, honest thought slight conspiracy theorist said before, turns true. bloody government. Dutch test already tested 1800 people real test street real conditions (the place around 20% positivity rate) couple weeks ago. also tested inside hospitals. proved filter 75% people certainty, decrease amount people need PCR. results extremely reliable, thus making ready mass deployment.

That's used Dutch testing sites month beginning next month. Dutch government already ordered hundreds devices. thing appear nowhere. Breathomix working breathalyzer detect cancer cells now, also researching applicability detect diseases create pneumonia. beginning May Dutch government approached company create COVID breathalyzer test. made test, tested it, proven reliable quick test, soon reaching mass deployment.

In comment provided sources: Lol upvotes comment prove point satirically making. side still related note: I’ve hearing reports people stock piling food supplies potential winter COVID wave Hi, Native-descended here. entirely self-sufficient without urban infrastructure removals. Happy suggest readings want understand POV ignorant happened here. *sad sounds*  vaccine two, three five years? long afford continue live like this, seem sustainable long term. say preventative measures justified short term, seem lot hopes plans depending vaccine available shortly. So, underreporting? OP, article English another Slovak proven otherwise I'm assuming legal residents. think learning languages important necessary yes. I'm afraid avert need economic stimulus. Slovakia preparing lockdown drive cases down, least certain regions, economic stimulus definitely needed save many businesses even come. could serious effect reduction R0 though, knock results truly 2 3 weeks. nit 733k potential reinfextions right now, cases 5+ months ago.

But get general point. either pro-science guy anti-science guy.

The pro-science guy published plan overcome Covid19 since March, accord successful plans elsewhere world. anti-science guy plan Covid19, crises reality, like climate crisis. anti-science guy elected, America loses allies history mark end American century November 2016. people post idiots assume doctors bc decent grammar think point people wished European response second wave good Australian response second wave. Lying sign leadership responsibility you? I'm surprised Trump. pointing out. fact Federal government little support states setting testing despicable hope so. everytime someone cold wants go store school whatever, wear damn mask. So, 25000 identified people families house arrest 14 days monetary support government. rest, normal work/life. lockdowns needed. 

Other countries procedure.

Let's bring darkness swift end. I'm glad government decided this. works, countries new weapon pandemic.  think fortune first lockdown, went early great success many states achieving elimination foment never took hold people could see would work old people die. well said, friend symptoms you? Would say better worse flu? asking question answer basicallly shows every day. wear masks public places might interact people dont know. dont wear masks home, somebody catches it, whole house might catch it. Usually people dont wear masks jobs interact coworkers, unlike Asie, wearing mask considered polite, considered impersonal, cold, distant overall negative hide face collective, mention people west consider obeyed submissed question actually sick. Catching covid home work like 60% confirmed transmissions, add public transport, full people 1 feet other, even masks save (only certified respirators might). consider majority people dont spread infection, rest ale superspreaders infectiong dozens people probably asymptomatic, infectious exposing lot people following strict guidelines. consider math infectious covid quickly spread population, really take much control. totally ignored covid, half planet would get infected 2020. Central Europe, part NATO, EU, Schengen, Eurozone, high GDP per capita, high human development, higher inequality-adjusted HDI US, western culture, Bratislava 12th richest region GDP per capita entire World (about Greater London).

Just can't point map mean shithole people live mud huts. purposely disingenuous acting bad faith. Stop, please. attempting spread misinformation doubt using [just asking questions solid dose fallacious claims backed single citation. morally repugnant. Sadly new normal, least people start take personal responsibility prevent spreading it. realistic expect people learn Slovakian? referenced post, actually. We’ve got far resources nation left states follow real Federal government support currently Spanish flu H1N1 pandemic?

No? 

I think so. tests used Ag tests, antibody tests. point find many people antibodies, identify isolate people infectious moment.

Though months ago one private health insurance companies antibodies testing part yearly physical exams clients number people antibodies like around 0.6%.

Also AFAIK confirmed antibodies Covid start disappearing months. consolation increase booze sales, im sure stupid halloween party bought shit ton cause wanna fucking BLASTED election day. want absolutely brain cells sober results come in. im sure others feel way, idk we'll see booze sales keep today tomorrow tuesday

but yeah thats bought lot booze today haha answer question. Well obviously. know meant people go “it’s flu, bro” purposefully splitting hairs? much better results communicated date. statement almost correct except reputation destroy going assume person little experience leadership responsibility. Along line, Trump purposefully lying public downplaying virus, discovered Woodward recordings? knew bad, worse flu, continually played down. What’s difference there. Please explain, assuming trust Trump Fauci. tests used 70% positivity rate according study PCR positive patients Czech hospital, even symptomatic, may infections there. tells us nothing percentage infected people critical condition though, since hospitalisations lag cases time currently infected people tested positive within last month. Non-N95 masks intended protect wearer.  Here's study 2011 proving masks effective.
 making policy, though unenforceable, probably makes people take concept seriously.

I would say opposite effect. I'm curious think likely effect. Unenforceable policies show ineffectual government increase disrespect policies. Laws like speeding mj possession often broken rarely enforced cause people respect speed limit smoke pot. lots lots anecdotal reports reinfection. False I'm one lucky whose life actually improved fair amount 2020. work field thrives pandemic times gotten massive pay bumps. live also restrictions low rates infection (for now) life feels rather normal otherwise.

The thing really changed attending parties wearing wearing masks daily. Whats wrong wanting work anyways ? INMATES RUNNING ASYLUM!!! better. I’m Atlantic Bubble. cases community spread (for now). least entire world ISNT laughing us, right? True, fallow rules/guidelines there’s repercussions.
That 20-30% really holding us back.
I legitimately people tell disappear election. 2 days pandemic we’ll back life usual, can’t wait! Lol Here's article March 6th referencing studies 2013 2011 proving hand washing effective. Nope. Mine going right fuck garbage soon mandate lifted. should, kind whole point :) Ok. Got it. Stop projecting me. unload offense commit.

I never mentioned traditional talk therapy. hospitalizations deaths people mainly 80 over, much population need vaccinated see normalcy again? reason lie somehow change fact deceptive. 

This lack sophistication talking earlier. treating deception, malicious, necessary, otherwise, same. Thats extremely naive, actual rule life (I doubt is), suffer it.

I'm literally addressing directly opinion interests me. surprising victim complex. Kinda like flu guess. Flu big deal ask people subreddit. That's really cool! wish state similar program going. Mass looking good right now, especially urban areas. I'm surprised VT list. That's humanity acting too. happens instill distrust others make impossible read facial expressions. Texan say “YEEEEHAAAaawugh ack *cough cough cough*” course Ireland fewer deaths, one fifth population Australia! Per capita though, actually better.

As see, Ireland slightly higher number daily deaths Australia Victoria locked down, therefore pretty much - lower - number Victoria had. Again, point? even talking about? Comparing areas like Victoria whose outbreak months ago areas experiencing outbreaks right now? basically compared Australia Germany August would come opposite conclusions, lol.

What even definition success according sub? Locking region months reaches zero cases? sub deems Europe's response failure many European countries going lockdown again?

My original point incredibly stupid compare current state things Australia current state things ""Europe"" (as Europe one single block, dumb begin with) order argue Australia better ""it believes science"" bullshit like that. asinine theory completely misses possible nuance complexity, even goddamn different timing. severe PTSD bad childhood it’s easy. Talk therapy doesn’t touch it, takes least long heal endure. look forward living world struggles finally understood validated, however, wouldn’t wish personal hell anyone. worst emotional flashbacks - don’t see anything, brain 100% convinced right back terror happening, it’s happening again. may know cognitively it’s 2020, however, overwhelmed emotions traumatic time period beside myself. unconsciously pick fights spouse, hair trigger temper, cry randomly, go numb, overwhelmed fear despair physically can’t move collapsed position couch, stop sleeping, bite nails fingers bleeding sore, stop eating entirely eat, isolate myself, barely talk - never things once, it’s like pulling handle slot machine get random cluster severe symptoms (there far these). I’m 5 psych meds partial hospitalization program year finally caught me. helped, program actually didn’t touch trauma. helped things like cognitive distortions taught cope. didn’t relieve pain, gave tools deal it. 

PTSD huge deal you’ll hurt people saying little therapy, midst retraumatized, trick. won’t. Talk therapy makes worse. Somatic experiencing gold standard trauma treatment. involves whole body - learn track observe sensations body rather continuing panic head. teaches soothe yourself, godsend. Memories stored body, muscles fascia connecting them, adequate release trauma often involuntary trembling shaking like dog. best part never speak trauma (which makes worse - every time repeat story reliving deepening grooves left brain).

Rewind therapy revolutionary new treatment cure visual flashbacks specific events period time. twice - don’t tell story happened. speak moment things started go wrong knew safe again. therapist guided meditation relax you, imagine watching event television minds eye. imagine reverse, like you’re rewinding movie. imagine forwards again, little faster. backwards speed. imagine screen watching shrink size iPad old school little TV, go one last time 2x fast, backwards. imagine ejecting DVD destroying it, therapist tells empowering things meaning trauma it’s significance life focus good things. makes empathetic resilient, example. 

In March single rewind therapy session violent sexual assault experienced 2014 CURED visual flashbacks nightmares specific event. never imagined healing would possible, monumental impact quality life relate people. symptoms never come back, feel empowered. story longer tell anyone, though still know happened, memory different one grocery shopping day school. emotional impact removed. Rewind therapy takes trauma memory recategorizes brain regular boring memory. longer invades thoughts memory get triggered, simply doesn’t bother much anymore. moved forward present - I’m stuck, trapped frozen past.

What needs order heal leave traumatic environment, somatic experiencing week year more, rewind therapy. needs strong, compassionate support network. need traditional talk therapy - make worse.

She can’t leave hospital yet, though everyone currently health care needs know either choose leave, time chosen burn completely something major within body goes wrong. Eventually, body says no, sabotages force stop. whole world fucked there’s one replace them. can’t train doctors nurses zoom. can’t. went veterinary school there’s way done person. thought said virus big deal. take vaccine? Yeah, least they're wearing thin pieces fabric face. Bullet dodged! Hate masquerading entertainment masquerading news. That’s stupid. american, care. DC blame, opening schools stupid. internet can’t. Period. get together won’t safe. may get lucky, won’t safe. Yea, like countries well. look Sweden.. time now, politics journalism finest. countries lockdowns currently:

In case I've censored here, pleased know go back echo chamber hear contrary opinions again. grown place around here. need childish things, like free thought differing points view. Mass Stop Spread (STS) locations significant community spread, community STS site in. Due reason, there's long lines, get tested need want it. would say no, see little benefit knowing whether covid not, unless get severe enough get admitted hospital, actually nothing home improve speed recovery. would let close contacts know sick, quarantine best could. start big trouble breathing, high fevers last week, consider going hospital. Belgium Germany help patients. US have? ""Anti-maskers,"" want call that, care anybody else puts face. want forced to. We’re dumb celebrating traditions? things make us happy?

I think majority humans point, don’t give shit virus, even deadly. People would rather go shit makes happy chance may catch virus, 99.9% survival rate.

If want stay inside protect go ahead, health isn’t responsibility. whole notion stop shit enjoy somehow protect someone I’ve never met, bullshit.

(For reference: family traditional, total 21 people attending. Thanksgiving gathering every year. ifs, ands, buts. feasible way convince everyone large gathering bad idea, especially surging cases. Most, them, frustrated masks social distancing, that's also table well.)

You're protecting ignoring top infectious disease expert country. generally agree this, question US currently get elective COVID test - symptoms contact someone COVID, planning traveling NY? 

Like strong suspicion practical perspective people country right literally can't go get COVID test travel. think that's even possible Americans right now.

Restictions least *possible* people follow they're going exist. Right. IFR Covid is, conservatively, 0.3%. contention lockdowns killed 3% population? RT external channel already cleared up. US citizens trying get get back hospitals side border I'm private sector I'm happy about. CSU team conduct particle filtration efficiency tests material.

So 99% inactivation catches, know % catching. Fine. isn't. difference may simply americans like hug much Asians reserved? Overall less individualistic collective bend. cultural anthropologist. 

But wait. coming years many fields science field days data collected now. Good you. average person frankly shared probably take early grave. not, power you. many endure kind hell. think missing point.

Epidemiology exists. Iceland even Europe, start.  Alright Yes that’s...how laws work understanding rapid antigen tests telling enough virus contagious, spotting everyone infected. infected still test negative, that’s common first. best used testing regularly mingling.

A positive tests means need another test. They’re mostly right need double check. Yeah complains poorly CA handled pandemic one lowest positivity rates country.

“I live Colombia. Things bad right now. many businesses shut many people lost jobs. amount people streets begging doubled, people desperate things food money.

It's horrible situation. super strict lockdown beginning, government understands people survive another one. like choice let people get infected, else people going starve.“ Um. realize everyone lives family? Plenty young adults live random roommates emotional connection to. fear spreading virus plenty keep families apart members essential workers etc. Maybe lived big happy mansion close friends family would better situation, that’s case.

You’re acting tone deaf.  breathing resistance? person breathing difficulties unfortunately top priority. I'm looking novel masks fans help breathing think made people like me.

On hand tried someKN95s even seal tape use least hour lungs get tired. Ah yeah. guess makes sense. No, keep categorizing stereotyping, totally going fix America. Persecute religious, conservative, Republicans, whites, everyone else gods chosen people. going backwards it’s frustrating, I’m white middle class I’m automatically problem. wonder America laughing stock world. seriously think anyone overseas making fun us imposing travel bans us becauase Republican Party? democrats staying home wearing masks, since think going win election Tuesday, making enough impact reblicans die virus COVID vanquished.

Eh, difference certain materials, likely negligible. already proven even basic masks reduce chance transmission HUGE amount. new material probably 1-2% difference most. 

Besides, make difference people around wear correctly (which sadly case way many dummies there). happen posing harm others infected car. product actually brought market, likely see schools, concerts, airports, hospitals. 

People fined complying local governments lockdown guidelines. guys joyful experience rn?

People like getting together. social beings. true regardless kind social conditioning. understand sneering, seriously, parents chose kids basing life plans able work kid school worked. supervised safe place.

This assumption held well what, 100 years so? bad run. seriously, nobody planned this. world turned head. Come on, think parents would totally fine (+ siblings) stuck home together months time? Everyone needs respite care, human need.

I'm lucky kid adult (and lives neither us get lonely). blame parents end rope trying figure possibly work conditions. many level internet connection / computers/phones/tablets / places house even work, supervision needed make work. nightmare sides. necessarily. testing last several weeks. we’ve also seen % positive go 5% nearly 9% 6 weeks. 

This coming Thursday AZDHS announce 8 14 counties categorized substantial spread “cases per 100k pop” metric. effort get ahead news shared public, last week changed guidelines schools say 3 metrics need substantial spread (instead one) recommend going back hybrid virtual learning. problem is, CLI metric isn’t considered substantial til 10% (compare Oregon benchmark 1.5%). substantial spread category 6 weeks summer absolute worst (and school wasn’t even session point). still better border Iowa hit 2,800 cases 1/4th population much less dense areas. want get though this, without constant chart climb, one real choice.
The China model.
Yeah one wants go due infringement rights, keep going loops infection, deaths, crumbled economics.

I'm across border Iowa hit staggering nearly 3k cases today nearly 1/4th population I've seen fewer people wearing masks week ever.

Victoria worst covid numbers cooler months fixed months serious lockdown, mandatory masks host support measures. warmer weather. Same, fantastic know yet. HIV illness lasts 2 weeks disappears years. 

Not saying like HIV, evidence heart damage even asymptomatic cases. tbh i'm surprised already universal indoor mask mandates Thanks!!

Hope works. would ray hope Europe. agree Chicago people seem taken seriously yet metrics pretty bad, know people getting from. thing think bars restaurants people going work, gyms, gatherings? it?

I wish would release statistics people getting help give little guidance people adjust daily routine. im sure close vaccine are, info floating around. vaccine pop probably half assed like let say 50% success rate.

“ technically “ vaccine rushed half bake dont even know might happen.

Best thing wait scientists say something public figures, county, mayors, etc. Guaranteed homelessness way scarier covid  scary. Many false statements. Here's truth. Sweden relied immunity start. That's Tegnell Giesecke kept downplaying obsessed immunity numbers. never right. strategy failed. Thousands died reason. Tegnell Giesecke said ""wait year see"". Norway Denmark never caught up. tried defend Sweden's failed strategy. tried claim neighboring countries would catch deaths. never happened. 

Right herd immunity strategy. ""soft"" lockdowns several cities. Authorities say go unless necessary. That's good. late. many people following rules. might another Swedish failure. Time tell.

Sweden absolutely *not* left country. stuck 40 years ago. Sweden one extreme laissez faire capitalist countries world. That's top 5 wealth inequality globally. level Russia, Ukraine Brazil. 60 70 80 percent tax wage earners, 20% tax rich capitalists. Even less reality tax cheat. ""very left wing"" country allow oligarchs like Wallenberg run country. That's absolutely left wing. Sweden right-wing, crony capitalist country economics leftwashing social policies. Stuff like punishing families take full maternity leave ""equal"". Stuff like social democrat party wants make preschool mandatory 2 year olds. That's Sweden known leftist nanny state, half true.

Since Sweden extreme laissez-faire capitalist economy. surprise also used right wing populist strategy like US Brazil used. even realistic. Even agreed recommend masks finally. Sweden still kicking screaming refusing everyone else already learned. yes, much damage done January. agree change leadership needed right really worry bad things going get. meantime protect course, vote wisely. Election Day this?  must use Trump’s framing political stunt? said ""wouldn't want US spread anti-lockdown propaganda Russia?"" 

It clearly reads proposal US spread propaganda. mean assumed Americans would want (but neutral opposed idea), would worth clarifying. Would happen know many people die tuberculosis year still? 1.5 million. death rate small pox, measles, polio vaccine available? Nobody even one generation ago would ever even entertain thought total lockdowns solve problems, terrible idea. causes mass starvation around world, sets precedent eroding civil liberties, psychological emotional damage etc. One day look back polices destroying many young lives way look back Iraq war, Vietnam. stupid support stuff. make millions act like idiots try decide real virus instead driving response.  experience, that's fucking likely. piece shit office open everything behind computer screen. Supposedly boss made hand comment criticizing I've taken multiple covid tests. Like fuck trying stay healthy protect others, right?

And Chicago, redneck shit hole south. Sorry dampen mood, I'm exactly optimistic shitty american culture changing better... Like, ever. ""Effingham County"" kind funny name.  all. 20% Covid-19 deaths 65 years old around 46,000 far. Americans 25 54 likely die Covid-19 murder.

Nearly 70% Texans overweight, 35% Texans obese. there's always pre-existing conditions get brought someone younger 80 dies Covid-19. Diabetes, heart disease, cancer, kidney failure.



The low percentage, 'only old people die' talking points proven wrong. majority Americans would considered pre-existing condition.



But guess sounded good 15 people Covid-19, would 0, Covid-19 would disappear Easter like miracle. businesses closing; foreclosures evictions, long-lasting unemployment, routine medical care suspended again, stock market crash, social unrest. supply chain issues real possibility winter. afford it, stock essentials. think intentionally made DNA testing would way track. point collect DNA every Mexican family missing kid, reason, far five hundred families. I'm sure why.   Cheap too. $20 bucks 20-30 filters. saved list. Thanks much football fields? Came looking comment! making two different assumptions:

1. changed message people refusing wear masks would wear mask now. 

They using excuse. messaging different masks group still wouldnt wear mask.

That group gonna listen matter tell them. look examples:

This group refused wash hands primary message (hell refused using bathroom). 

Same group unprotected casual sex despite us telling unsafe feels better without condom. 

2. simple messaging enough contain panic buying. 

You understand panic buying.

Panic buying natural phenomena seen world crisis (Y2K peanut butter). matter officials say people panic something needs get people's system. 

If said masks help would also meant healthcare workers get masks. would spread masks. extent did, never never got past first wave panic buying. 

Wave 1 small group reacts starts hoarding. people beought multiple carts toilet paper. group also buying masks. 

Wave 2 everyone else gets nervous seeing people hoarding goods, see dwindling supply essential good buy little bit necessary. good shortages start. 

Wave 3 wave 2 things blown exponentially. goods shertage becomes apparent people start buying more. months empty shelves.

Wave 4: Demand starting normalize (although people nervous bit elevated). Supply chains drive. toilet paper lots it. People slowly getting acostom seeing full stock 

Now lying masks government prevented wave 2-3. 

That allowed stockpile masks healthcare workers. hear message say need masks healthcare workers. 

As soon there's adequate supply (at least Canada) 180 masks.  sub funny. 90% threads USA. 10% top comments always people like you, trying convert thread USA. Even they’re seeing people, still reduces risk. It’ll never eliminate tho. you’re bubble 10 people they’re seeing plus 9 people, that’s exposing 90 people. It’s still better bubble saw 20 friends exposed 9 others (or they’re otherwise isolating either). 

If you’re comparing bubble complete isolation it’s obviously inferior, you’re comparing bubble reduced contact it’s huge benefit. 

And it’s realistic contact others whatsoever. childcare options MiL SIL daycare (with 20 kids 5 teachers). bubble MiL SIL superior, even tho know SIL still sees people. haven’t eliminated risk, bubble reduced risk. Anything Scott Atlas, I'm reading shit

Dude less-than-0 credibility ANYTHING public health-related got lucky thats scary thought part frustration term lockdown. Everyone different idea means. me, strong lockdown would everything except grocery stores takeout restaurants closed, leaving house except outdoor exercise (1 2 hours per day) walking dog, public private events. now, 50. think 30 35. Damn, two hundred comments first five hours. happened? I’m NY, city, cases triple positive rate well. fairly certain it’s schools open hope shut figure get needy kids access stop madness. patterns looking at? Echo away. never anything good people except use argument point. Quite simply, ""guaranteeing"" remote people equivalent healthcare delusion. people reservations stay viable options outside rez, on-reservation, ""elected"" leaders crooks play favorites indulge corruption worse anything people America would tolerate democratically-elected government. ignorant, right. exactly panicking about? lockdown happen cases surging higher ever before, really panic. RIP condolences family I'm thinking back holidays kid. We'd go aunt's house. dad four siblings, kids. would add 30 pretty quick. Especially cousins kids (well lol).

Some people bigger families. Hell Christmas every year grandma's side family would usually join too. dad's cousins not. 

This year however, aunt Crohn's disease refusing go anywhere lol. brother flying home Colorado, since I've seen pictures girlfriend partying without masks, nah. I'll see next year maybe. misplaced priorities ...

It's exceptional .. Hey Auckland, New Zealand. Good see Aussie got stuff control (particularly since sister lives Melbourne). Auckland's second lockdown challenge sure...but honestly...when look rest world really seem like pretty small sacrifice make. knows US going look like Xmas. think going good. Third? never finished first [There many hope temporary. Something feels wrong negative certificate thing specifically, basically unless it, hard lockdown applies next round testing (next weekend).

I meant negative card temporary  Guy's BS-ing back forth calling hoax, claiming vaccine almost here, saying flu, whatever nonsense suited moment. 

Realistically, trials final phases COULD possible early December, though sometime 2021 realistic. swear state full idiots. good Halloween too. People generally wore masks, except eating/drinking/pictures. felt good! one stopping meeting family. LIVE families. anything spending much time them. people living alone, still visit families form support bubble.

The majority complaints pubs, gyms, travelling etc closing. Sad Oxford vaccine being, been, tested thoroughly vaccine released U.K. fact could argued tested vaccines given people stage III testing (tens thousands) usual - several thousand common. Phizer still expects read outs November EU gunning Oxford seems thing, actually, notice asking OP didn’t want that.

Normally time Russia mentioned people lose minds. look found site, although I’m Canada can’t vouch authenticity. click “next” twice get graph choose “Hospitalisations” drop down. Looks like 50% hospitalisations 70. future grim, real grim. UK think debunked theory suppress open(ish) borders, high testing mediocre contact tracing limits indoor dining/pub numbers.

It work. thing infectious. got downvoted shit suggesting New York trajectory - OK maybe slower - pattern undeniable.

I've given up, thing works Asia-Pacific model. visited office saw this, would leave find new dentist. I’ve done quite times restaurants retail stores. simply won’t go place doesn’t care protecting workers therefore customers. Honestly doctors reported medical board. sure anyone care, should. happens governer total garbage human downplays virus, cancels local countermeasures general Trump lackey. hope right. schools open, expect time worse. uh....not good. used believe endemic coronaviruses reinforcing people similar reasons, floor research SARS changed perceptions that. found various mechanisms viruses provide explanation better explained viruses evading immune response manipulating advantage. Thailand, Taiwan 1933 seems likely repeat itself. anti-intellectual aspect fascism strong country. types attacks scientists speak good faith eventually lead mass exodus best brightest minds US. Add changes made H-1B visas tech companies research facilities hard pressed talent drives innovation. say this, sounds like there’s major time crunch going logistically. people expecting vaccine ready till January earliest, hours probably wouldn’t horrible. Absolutely not, hospitals pay labor use. going guys. sub-reddit. said, people want know truth google find out. immunity

...is false picture sweden's response painted foreign media and/or politicians. slovakia... usual Mostly Cuomo policies regarding elderly. old folks homes forced take sick contagious patients would seen massive number initial deaths. 

We’re unaware folly? Boris dreaming really think 4 weeks it. chance meaningful reduction cases rolls thru close contacts. 

The best hope stability (probably aim reality) even wishful thinking. Even severe lock downs Victoria , Australia took months get numbers much lower starting point lower population density. guy work calls spamdemic convinced disappear immediately election.... way talks think may also assumption single bat wreaking havoc, visiting people night like tooth fairy. Well, I'd argue would better knowledge. Statistics inevitable part world works, whether choose try understand better (and thus make better choices) not.

Also knowing simple things like probabilities independent dependent events work hardly ""advanced"" Yawn. Hospitals counties near FL certainly overwhelmed. mean nurse sister pretty mad can't get OT ever since March though.

You get feel like smart virtuous everyone else ignorant POS. said again. comment saying expect 30k plus cases day sometime December. won’t happen.

For country?. sad? activities important lot people. isn’t sad all. Consider judgmental. Yes, need sacrifice things right isn’t safe uncontrolled spread virus, it’s sad people miss things. Hey everyone... break lockdown orders driving freeway fine. lol..... Funny testing many people come lots cases, despite Trump's claims. moment gets dysmal finally makes ""click"" nay-sayers way fucking late.

This gonna Dakotas month less. going fucking brutal late.

The consequences listening Trump. two options: Either follow social mitigation guidelines — including mask-wearing — **or** face unchecked community spread eventual lockdowns. 

Fighting self-inflicted wound.

Which be? rest us can’t work y’all; you’re part reason we’re mess. mass vaccinations mean trying vaccinate everyone country? No. mass vaccinations mean prioritizing high risk groups moving onto everyone? Probably. countries preparing vaccine awhile, Canada already materials needed vaccinate everyone twice. don’t think would announce vaccine ready completely 100% ready too, imagine letdown that. 

With said, leaked email intended viewed public. sure logistics work, could preparing vaccinate chances going low. fire PPP money turns “grant” “loan” meaning go getting “free” pay back interest. 

So since Disney laying workers paid via PPP return every dollar interest tacked federal government. 

So say Disney got 100,000,000 (I clue got I’m using round numbers conversation). could kept money free laid one. 

Now laid people owe government $100,000,000 + interest loan. 

The tax payers/federal government making money here. 

That’s good. already know happens normal hospitals get full Temporary hospitals get put Hospital ships get Etc doom gloom scenario fucking science fiction.

I mean 25,000+ died New York so... really? Germany ""Juice"" reserved 100% juice (Vitamins allowed - nothing else)

The next step (25% (Only extreme sour fruits)-50% Juice) called ""Nectar"" (+ 20% sugar)

There also ""Schorle"" (50%+ Juice + CO2)

and lowest tier ""Fruchtsaftgetränk"" 6-30% juice.

&amp;#x200B;

So order orange juice, always get real one... power COVID seem taking behind shed one seems fine? They're busy blaming DC

There's lot Trump admin. actively make things worse.

And there's fact pay 7x many taxes federal government. feasible local government same. don’t really see either looking graph end. 2018 looks like worst outbreak started winter Europe unlike Australia. Europe couldn’t prepare Australia time see happened Europe. Australia strategy Europe : hard lockdown winter lifted summer season. points virus comeback. It’s clear Europe nothing lockdown work winter...

So shit comparison, forget countries UK, France, Spain Italy big hub tourist destinations.

Plus Australia lonely island countries Europe connected need stay connected economy. thing pandemic response taking right course action inevitably look like overreaction, anything less look like severe underreaction. Oxford hasnt really performing well, Pfizer much likely first market data good. Many governments, including U.S., provide limited financial coverage covid-19 vaccine complications. Recipients basically own. ok tradeoff, many aren't.

The development testing process rushed various companies, shielded liability, seeking profit; driving stock prices. Strong temptation take shortcuts. Tragedies rushed vaccines happened times past. test seems useless unless gonna testing every week..... bullshit storm Absolutely I’m glad it! south east relatively low reported cases last weeks, we’ve real tourist destination people around uk. People coming group camping holidays jump train wherever straight pub work plenty act virus never existed. come right bar mask get belligerent new protocols. I’m relieved many ways deal little bit. That's disappointing ... (for looking another reason bash Sweden)

Here's news... really news. grand total might keep pace covid19's exponential growth couple weeks. stockpile medical resources big enough keep pace exponential growth long. Hate double downer still know sure gonna go might wait awhile things settle point we're dealing fallout still blast damage slow burn lol Pfizer furthest ahead atm, able apply EUA US 3rd week November. volunteer hospitals nurse US.

As award, Trump trash stealing PPE something. buying MCU movie. Depends long lockdown much stimulus. $1200 month rent weeks food I'm confused. right wing told open means jobs everyone. telling health economics experts right right wing wrong ***again***? Unpossible. PPP loans require use PPP money pay employees. fire that. use pay employees fire others. it’s lack hospital beds, therapies equipment worry managersamid surge, 229,000 deaths COVID-19 U.S. It’s depleted exhausted hospitals staffs needed care need life-sustaining therapies.

It's ""not enough beds"" means, no? That's sort collaboration need seeing of, EU help facilitate. 

I can't believe actual minor scandal allowing 'foreign military' (Austrian doctors &amp; medics!) country help national effort mass testing. 2020, people live united Europe (most time) open borders, military cooperation joint battle groups, comes humanitarian effort 'outrage'? I'll sure take first means it'll help other. Stop antivaxxer. frontline workers people preexisting conditions constant fear getting virus I'd like option getting vaccine want. Theyre forcing maskless environment, could record makeup applications home. whole makeup academy online they're making us apply school. far makeup client im excited one bit maskless clients either. Also transfer friend forced take makeup course either, far know, state board required. watched cheesy alien abduction movie netflix ate chocolate. Saw lots people instagram parties. Also add. know? testing infancy. clue initial spread like. 

3.6 rontgen jokes everywhere website. Sheriffs usually elected. seems help accountability :) Ahh yes, avoid reopening, stay locked forever. Actually... made me, others I’m sure, realize much take granted.

Family gatherings,
School,
Friends,
Eating restaurant,
Letting people outside household hold cuddle newborn,
Going get groceries, go shop fun, try clothes, go fundraiser, get together bar... without fear contracting deadly virus..
Vacationing big city popular beach without concern family’s health.. cancelled travel plans.
Random friends stopping by. Play dates. Drinking wine random Wednesday girlfriends. 

There’s more, damn took granted, even complained before.  Rounding turn November. Nah.

Emergency care provided matter what.

CoVID19 changes that. Absolutely, prime minister copped much shit high tailing Hawaii nothing save face seek medical advice shut borders early. Although fires bad happened wonder would result could continued executive pay cut due Covid, got rid gotta eat, right???? definitely government assistance everyone, clue homelessness factor Agree. already know many called rare COVID long effects seen flu infectious disease. Covid ain't special.  Totally worth it. knows 'rona killing *dozens* people??? usually 40-50 Thanksgiving gatherings attend. But, year, one husband's family traveling Austin. 

We've never done turkey ourselves, interesting. Pardon? aggressive? I'm talking people engaging simple simple (like wearing masks sick) save lives. jfc. Congratulations! Sounds like folks pulled something quite amazing. really promising news, College football players Soccer players, lot covid none decrease performance.


This may mean affects Covid heart, lungs isnt bad scientists thing. realize could get results 15 minutes now. 

I guess still understand testing people symptoms. arguing points, looking clarification. 

I understand overall goal flatten curve, etc.... testing everyone it?

Is matter testing everyone today, quarantine, test everyone next month?

Originally, going include personal situation sure would matter. add show interested this. 
I went see relative hospital due auto accident in. 10 days visited, diagnosed Covid. Luckily, symptomatic negative effects. us tested day visited, would negative would worried. However, tested 10 days later found it. Considering people lactose intolerant. lot people even know... dairy propaganda machine. Feeling superior what? I'm embarrassed part sad sack nation proud ignorance. 

Our hospitals overflowing struggling care already there. heart breaks health care professionals tearing apart give treatment probably take virus seriously. 

I wish docs nurses could save efforts legitimately tried safe pandemic, try save people blatantly ignored safety protocols. Worse yet, look many people claim shit made up. covid deniers would sooner spit face nurses wear mask, get sick, still get care? shit angers core. One sentence bullshit trickle economics without preponderance actually going makes one seem like ass well. 

Unless Reddit. case pile guy rational explanation topic don’t seem understand. want understand matter. Real football American version? wrong? summer months, discussion begun, US South America worse Europe, doubt that. opposite. moment, cases start rise US too, unfortnately. race - better worse. discussion saw summer Sweden(blaming right path), considerated example many things. Aww fit agenda everyone gets covid dies? mean said school forcing upon you. Im simply telling they're not... mandatory get license.  first. they're first line, like hundred thousandth (guesstimate, less vaccines, more.ofr others). Normal Joe? Gonna 20 millionth so. Enough expected US alone 20 million doses 2021 starts. common sense. protect community themselves. People follow safety protocols. Mask wearing, social distancing... people saved themselves, clogging hospitals, infecting others. pretty much none. youre 25 chances dying traffic bigger dying covid (if it). mean yes virus dangerous old people people sub really need stop acting like catching means 50/50 chamce dying. youre young like people party probably likely arent real danger even catch covid. Again, doesnt mean parties right stop rediculous fear mongering Yeah country apparently still doesn’t need stimulus lmao  what’s scary pandemic isn’t direct result global warming it’s crowding, overpopulation. keep ignoring climate change don’t know viruses could icebergs etc. Yes, 2020 additional peak due COVID starts around week 12 ends around week 21. additional peak shown bottom plot well. Deaths lag behind cases. France fine last month so. I'm skeptical per capita deaths France versus US remain far apart coming weeks. Sure...COVID double that’s direct correlation hospital stays. 

How long Navy Hospital Ship stay NYC? Like week 2? long. hospitals Central Park. long. 

Obviously resources necessary people thought would be. know, presuming know people thinking kinda makes one seem like ass. anything though unless prepared stop car, subway air traffic. 5 6 Australian states open 5 months, small spike one states amounting hundred cases brought control.
It got away one state forced lockdown control well.
The two major football codes played finals 10 days ago Sydney Brisbane front crowds 40 30 thousand respectively cases result, Sydney Opera House hosted first live music event since beginning pandemic weekend.
Australians expecting spikes outbreaks part eventuated, still light restrictions place, international borders closed state borders still partially open allow trade life normal global pandemic. I'm Floridian (state based tourism) many/most favorite places world built international tourism mass migration (the Caribbean, NYC, New Orleans, coastal New England, Colombia, Portugal extent). world tight border controls strange sad place me. Taiwan, South Korea, Vietnam, Asian countries Wow, everything really bigger Texas

I'm sorry. Humor last coping mechanism working right 3 vaccines likely December 50 million doses available. able get vulnerable people healthcare workers, move there. Ramping production going take while. leading 3-4 companies get chance roll vaccines. Literally 7 billion need it, 2 shots likely dose. 

Assuming 50% people decide get it, going produce 7 billion next year-ish. ""I feel dreadful. longer cold. ache over, head thumping, eyes burning, throat constricted. cold travelled chest hacking cough,' wrote time.  I'll take money !remindme 1 month looking like December they'll start roll available need around spring people widely vaccinated. That's everything goes plan. 

Trump's reliable source. human broken clock. likely would increase effectiveness shaping mask better face, see can’t speak Liberians Ghanaians, Chadians Togolese don’t take regular malaria Medicine 1. 70% effectivity second round testing, people early stage infection lower % get picked up.
2. 25,850 antigen test positive + 46,929 active cases (from PCR tests) better represent many total active cases have, estimate goverment 200 000 like two weeks ago still way lower.
3. healthcare can't guarantee 0.6% death rate long.  Well deaths lacking 10 days behind, every suspected death autospy confirm main case death covid. rule people died covid cause covid directly. What's blood type? pulled planning discussions regarding ""scarce resource allocation"" decision making process get ICU, vent, etc.. run out. really hoping need it. Sitting 65,823 right now. manage keep 80k somewhat good thing...but still bad. well either way doomed. don’t think viable strategy stay longer lockdown. cases ok beginning summer goal always open country tourism industry. 

Harder measures beginning September could helped, feel like second lockdown inevitable anyway. Let’s hope we’ll third one. turning corner.... grandma (89) doesnt leave house wasnt tested well permanent address dont live may able get whole population paper. ""Well, maybe rest house fire, bedroom NONE ISSUES.""

Hundreds thousands Americans dead, care ""ARE NOT.""

What call someone pathologically indifferent suffering even horrible deaths humans?  It’s much schools crazy house parties people have. I’ve seen around live road I’m taking pictures fall colors. One house passed country 100+ cars. slow spread people aren’t following guidelines? selfishness idiots puts rest us risk overwhelms hospitals. 

If you’re going stupid conduct pandemic given meds sent home hospital. crazy video still monetized despite literally spreading covid misinformation I’m anti vaxxer. get flu vaccine every year date vaccines. I’m type person want take vaccine soon becomes available would like see work large population inject substance body. Nice job jumping conclusions. funny countries avoiding lockdown want affect economy much.

That's argument Sweden lock down. Sweden lock 

1. legally possible 
2. They're long-term strategy, trying avoid restriction fatigue long-run (there still bunch measures course) actually already know results were. Arkansas Department Health reported 33 deaths due Coronavirus November 1, 2020. highest number deaths single day Natural State. According ADH, Arkansas COVID-19 death toll stands 1,958. 867 new confirmed probable cases reported last 24 hours, brings total number coronavirus cases 113,057. 10,420 Arkansans currently active covid-19 cases. Governor Asa Hutchinson shared news case death count Facebook following message: ""There 867 new COVID-19 cases AR. number higher normal Sunday reminds us must win every day fight. Sadly, 33 deaths highest yet. safe week &amp; let’s part stop spread communities."" Good lord, comment history.

Can get friends please. rate viruses happening last decades, inevitable hit them. little separates chance current virus one far notable mortality rate. worse virus future, US likely fair better dealing it. lack ability learn mistakes downfall country. much stuck past empathy anyone else. know good people there; but, Trump president, large group people representing nation good people. ones worth paying attention absolutely tiny number, worrying nonetheless rarity *both* infections sequenced means definition miniscule number cases eligible definitive confirmation. many there, know many yet. maybe drug already take also works counter covid 19 big pharma health insurance companies would lose much money

Think would rather get kick back something costs $2700 $3? pretty easy see world capitalism chose bin cheaper alternative besides rather live country slightly higher rate people daying coronavirus (which never know sure case seeing china lies numbers) live literal dictatorship actively carrying genocide part population wrote November **2019**. Make America Canadian Again? don’t need follow link tell fact accurate. 30% referring one 1000 fact math yourself. 5 million people live 5000 testing positive day grab calculator ""We're testing death numbers inflated"" -cultist #5,437 always trade-off specificity sensitivity designing test. gold standard, q-pcr nasopharyngeal, quite sensitive (89%). cannot read article without “logging in”, read manuscripts like read understand methodology come conclusions. statement “these findings indicate noteworthy rate recovered patient could still asymptomatic” seems like conjecture unless solid methodology supports claim Yeah scientists studies working liberal think tanks.  It’s fake news!!! Conspiracy!!

I hate put /s literally always chance get sick. know state government responsibility mess also  Anyway get day results least 24hrs? want immediate family holidays elected literal fucking cannibal I’m doubtful that. plan wearing mask when...

On plane public transit.
Cold winter days. warm! last night. Went take dog walk around midnight saw least ten house parties, masks 15+ people inside. 

Don’t think we’re going great Thanksgiving. countries don’t black people executed cops reason.  people charge decisions access unblinded data? much familiarity process. sucks Yawn

What sort person finds deaths hundreds thousands people yawn?

Hint: mental condition leads one consider lives humans worthless? US hits 200k cases day, trump say ""we're testing more"". blame? Put tent instead… Americans care

People lost livelihoods, jobs, family members gall suggest single American cares. Fuck dude, many us best right now. haven’t seen friend/family member since February. Don’t spout bullshit none us care. Fuck you. UAE ppl already gotten second shot vaccine. would gladly risk getting sick, perhaps even dying meant lockdowns. Sucks people tht young now. Gonna miss best part lives immediately enter work grind Many places world wore masks sick long covid sign respect stop transmission infectious illnesses. I'm sure know better all. COVID January.

Chances something like literally 1 million, enough cases Jan outside Wuhan (or maybe Palermo). better chances getting hit lightning given year. given nobody know makes even less likely.

What one common cold viruses (perhaps even seasonal coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2). characteristic symptom COVID ""metallic"" taste either, fairly common cold-and-flu symptom, complete absence taste+smell.

Yeah, resting heartrate spiking slightly could due mild infection. Going hard Navy ship dock rural mid-west... doctor. got job, seemingly, favorite fox news medical pundit. Wait... complaining people going bars eating pizza selfish also need job serving people? I'm saying selfish - probably are. But, I'm confused post. I'm bar hopping order food try support restaurants. would hope owners vigilant keeping people safe enforcing patrons compliant. Maybe I'm shape thought RHR 52 sounds really good. Pre lockdown working constantly playing bjj 3x week averaging 55 lockdown went high 60s. I've working getting back low 60s days kudos someone UK subreddit argue literally healthcare system WORLD overwhelmed covid. made see red. think place world met reasonable definition healthcare overwhelm--from Lombardy NYC Guayaquil--you simply paying attention. There's going much trauma medical staff world this. judge says

Somewhat confusingly, Texas county managers called ""County Judges"" actual judges judicial functions. chief executives county. Congratulations, amazing!! Depends efficacy.

Interestingly, higher efficacy vaccine, longer it'll take results become available.

This due trial protocols set readout target based total number confirmed cases within entire trial group, vaccine control. vaccine 100% effective, infections come control group, means it'll take quite bit longer reach target number infections vaccine completely useless (0% effective). Actually vast majority people prepared whatever takes protect families, country, fellow man. want clarity resolve lead them. states going pay steeeeep economic political price. could see NY California many others. Absolutely nothing reason it’s barley touched Africa, isn’t population people Witt serious long term health conditions large population people 80/90
And dementia etc.
No matter many downvotes get constantly facts remain healthy young people one two hundred thousand chance dying covid 19 like seriously look data. 

And look population pyramid Liberia 80% population 45 maths. This. essentially mayors unincorporated areas counties. like test good enough. matter they're catching people high CT values. PCR test way accurate oftentimes. thought Trump waved magic wand went away Federal crime? federal law violate? Last time jannies nuked thread OP included articles FIRST SENTENCE post title, lol. is:

“Millions Colombians longer afford feed properly lockdown measures devastated economy.” 

Unequivocally true statement. blame. deserves every derisive comment gets. lockdown America never going effectively happen.

In countries locked hard, even protests allowed, regardless cause..

But Americans see massive crowds 50k+ people allowed, encouraged mainstream news sources incredibly demoralizing. course even extreme liberal havens like NYC, people going break down. China can't believe aim, right now... weird response explaining clearly need extreme measures Flu, replying asking fucking question again.  rocket science. getting that? I'm pointing dichotomy real. never get single conviction. UK lockdown starting Thursday blame Trump Cuomo, democrat, deaths New York, need mental help. ""Hey Patrick, I?""

""Uh, stupid?""

""No, I'm Texas!""

""What's difference?"" Ending lockdown worth life. That's understandable, Anti-USA sub. weird response. paper really, risky school liabilities. issue needing supervise students. Kinda rough thrown fire part training without real supervision ready catch you. expecting nurses clean students mess. 

Maybe summer calm periods could prepare case window bit tight that. Lol Joe Rogan thinks Gavin Newsome done shitty job handling covid 😂 Sheriffs directly elected chief police appointed another elected position (the mayor, city official, committee city officials). influenced heavily political biases. Iowa also tracking 30% positivity. Blame Governor. “substantial under-ascertainment cases, estimates IFR converging approximately 0.5 - 1%” Yes, would lot harder. Almost unthinkably hard. denying that. Still viable strategy.

Europe firmly locked worst worlds. Another lockdown, likely many months long, prospect whatsoever eliminating virus due economic damage done first time. really one shot getting right. Yes, new cases last 24 hours. on-brand. “Remember thing that’s good? Well actually could also bad.” live small town NY you’d surprised many people adhering 14 day qt respect virus wanting get others sick. know many taken upon so. Send Help. bunch parties Halloween. Next weeks gonna suck idk dude, trolling pretty American pursuit Quick! Convert mattress stores hospitals! 7-day running average SD 9 deaths. That's 3,000 per day normalized US population. 

The idea far fetched (much less impossible) hold water. know let spread happen unchecked country catch within weeks months. know IFR least 0.4% (that's lowest number could possibly justify back summer). math hard. thing that's impossible predicting whether we'll stop let happen. Okay so, typo, wrong? tell much spend entire article implying killed lockdown. nice guys finished last, case. It’s hard mask up. weigh enough information properly measure risks?  cocaine enthusiast, Jr., saying 1000 Americans dying everyday ""almost nothing"". release Crisp County Sheriff's Office, Hillman died Houston Medical Center Warner Robins.   contracted COVID-19 duty Crisp Regional Hospital. assigned hospital division, according release. 

The replacement officer may seeing life flash eyes. 50 yrs old health issues, fine. wife parents live them, officer may worried them. know. I'd say still second wave. Scott Atlas cook pointing lockdowns socioeconomic effects? Lol, exactly think ""Masks work? No."" Fauci's plan exact thing that's already done?

The answer here? Youre misrepresenting reality.

Edit: Mods, 10% Americans disfavorable view Fauci. anti-Fauci posts getting brigaded upvoted top comments sub, dun seriously fucked up. Yeh school every year 1 sent home, one biggest aswell, I'm concerned. mum nan told stay home lives still go environment? Crazy Hm, can't confirm German. Google Translate might work simple sentences, lot common complicated ones mess sometimes. prefer DeepL Translate. Honest question, still friends them? 

I'm boat main friend group bunch morons acting like nothing's happened since day one, going bars clubs house oarties. Im super interested friends anymore. think positive trend, testing never better been. testing locations, tests available shorter waiting times. think basically first time massive testing shortage supply demand testing (except summer period basically cases Netherlands).

But could due school vacation last week. means we're still seeing positive trend nonetheless. think stricter measures taken two weeks ago people taking corona seriously again, resulted slowing growth infections Japanese college roommate insisted cleaning dorm room US university checking leaving good. told unnecessary said leave good impression. Maurik CEO company.....

Edit: Dutch one... Oh yeah ones Fort Detrick. place Chinese state media spokespeople say plausible covid created. think came China via Wuhan Military Games whatever reason Americans get single medal.  
  
I dunno man, makes sense saying come Chinese person eating bat somewherei n Wuhan Chinese people even eat bats. eaten rural Indonesia, Palau traditional dish people US. (""The New York Times Natural Foods Cookbook"" Jean Hewitt (c) 1971, Quadrangle Books, Inc. NY.)  
  
That [cambridge revealed strain covid people Wuhan **not** original strain.  
  
But wait there's more, Covid detected sewer samples collected Dec 2019.  
  
A New Jersey mayor tested covid antibodies believes Nov, 2019.  
Even chilling symptoms [vaping match covid symptoms 100%. looks like CT scan. Yes yes yes. cannot tell many times I’ve cried desk year. Okay wokie Try increasing ventilation how? outdoors would ideal, cannot, open windows increase heating, might able reduce concentration virus room, kind like letting smoke out. Also research suggest increasing humidity reduce virus transmission, droplets likely hit water particles air travel far. Good luck. Sorry hear Good job, Slovenia. mean technically Stanford isn’t Ivy League school. point remains true. Gloucester. Looks like I'm test positive thanks selfish cunt boss let office work home despite fully possible technologically illiterate inconvenient (plus ass chair can't see working, probably working amirite?). Coworker take covid seriously unmasked around family last weekend subsequently tested positive. came symptoms tested positive. another person came symptoms, did. Guessing we're going positive. Although allegedly cunt symptoms exposed person developed symptoms starting Friday recently Friday afternoon, run around office without masks seem consented other's ""bubbles"" regard wearing masks office pretty minimal.

Been line get tested almost 4 hours - EXACTLY wanted spend Sunday, feel like shit fever body aches headache. Oh I'll expected work tomorrow, including leaving house go office hour pick stuff up/drop stuff off. Fun times! Try avoid room time much, avoid long conversations indoors possible, look need together, masking help. Best luck! day dead celebrated Spain, it’s Mexican holiday. mean call Mexicans “Spanish” problem.

Take instance Hotels Heroes emergency accommodation program. Front line workers lived multi-generational households given hotel rooms prevent household spread(the common way covid spreads). paid government. government didn’t cut check hotel CEOs like US did. put place program solved two problems. Please let know misrepresenting program, I’ve read helpful preventing household spread. stay home skip year. That’s responsible option. work venice. based saw last night, we’re fucked.

edit: also work area significant amount young adults love party. Pods really work people seeing seeing though. lot people don’t think though. Guy literally fucking idiot. research article appeared Nature Medicine (Published: 29 October 2020)

Title: Wearable sensor data self-reported symptoms COVID-19 detection

URL: screening COVID-19 typically includes survey questions symptoms travel history, well temperature measurements. Here, explore whether personal sensor data collected time may help identify subtle changes indicating infection, patients COVID-19. developed smartphone app collects smartwatch activity tracker data, well self-reported symptoms diagnostic testing results, individuals United States, assessed whether symptom sensor data differentiate COVID-19 positive versus negative cases symptomatic individuals. enrolled 30,529 participants 25 March 7 June 2020, 3,811 reported symptoms. symptomatic individuals, 54 reported testing positive 279 negative COVID-19. found combination symptom sensor data resulted area curve (AUC) 0.80 (interquartile range (IQR): 0.73–0.86) discriminating symptomatic individuals positive negative COVID-19, performance significantly better (P &lt; 0.01) model1 considers symptoms alone (AUC = 0.71; IQR: 0.63–0.79). continuous, passively captured data may complementary virus testing, generally one-off infrequent sampling assay. still fair amount food, still need bit refreshing. part? gets deleted low quality info, shut grievances, right? mask mandates essential travel only?

Edit: JobKeeper, JobSeeker supplements, Cash Flow Boosts etc - programs kept businesses afloat people fed could get tough yards. fan LNP either, least went approved measures. They’ll put in... handcoughs. Maybe Melania rent room think COVID-19 mandate longer work? government? already started stockpiling again, expecting worst. bet shown state controlled media inside Russian itself, though. RT tool influence subversion, meant foreign audiences.  lockdown isnt even strict melbourne. half measures prolonging pain Colombia strong lockdown— borders closed international flights blocked entry March way september. Maurik who? People don’t understand basic exponents. don’t comprehend quickly couple hundred cases turn millions. aren’t used conceptualizing exponential growth.  golf year-round Scotland even. biggest issue winter golf frozen turf--particularly greens. St Andrew's, Scotland, average January low .4* C average high 6* C. colder average January days, I'm sure courses close England/Scotland they're open part. also worth noting ""golf culture"" UK bit hardcore North America. get infected via digestion? Y'all sucks. officially tested positive. Got roomate wouldnt stop weekly sports. Symptoms havent bad. fever day. Didnt lose senses yesterday. little cough. Usually worst morning. 6 days right now. breathing issues yet, bad anxiety whats making worst me. mind keeps telling ite going get worst. Singapore version also tested specialised hospital meant Covid patients 95% specificity. higher 75% mentioned, mention they're conducting tests. I'm sure difference means anything.

You consider extremely high positivity rate Netherlands. Nationally 17% two weeks ago. read it, bit unclear. real-world test, tested 1800 people.
Out 1800 people, 1350 (75%) received certain negative result. others (450) uncertain. Using test positivity Amsterdam 2 weeks ago, calculate around 360 tested positive whole group. means breathalyzer uncertain negative case 90 cases. 90 1800 people received test didn't, 5%. goal test find certain negative cases. test find 90 1440 negative people, means found negative cases accuracy 94%. Even important, false negatives practically 0%, means positive cases slips (saw interview). 

If extremely low positivity rate, total people test negative part total tested breathalyzer accuracy Singapore company founded Covid, September 2019. university research spin-off company, fly-by-night operation.

Good see they're already playing role fighting diseases, young company! Ok, cunt going happen wave; simply time it.

This healthcare system collapses. overwork staff give enough support, they'll leave. already left due health concerns people close them, bunch going leave thing winds realize much pandemic sucked them. posted archive Covid infections deaths side-effect rallies, intent. President's go-to boy, Scott Atlas, pushing hard herd immunity. every rally, President mocks mask wearing rails social distancing. approximately 330 million people US, maybe 65% need get infected get herd immunity, 214,500,00 need catch it. 1% die, that's 2 million people need die. Ventilate die.  get it, learnt new word credence, need multiple incidents thing happening rather single guy talking TikTok. Following health guidelines stupid reasons still following guidelines. days, people understand Bae’s theory. 95% hospitalizations 70 older entire thing.

In Ontario (canada) 95% hospitalizations 85 older. I'm sure getting information grossly misrepresenting truth. even paid attention last 4 years? ""Not killing people"", there's reason vaccines tested, kill people. It’s relevant anything. people think tend high correlation men think women enjoy complimented inappropriate comments. daughter noticed worse year. 

She able successfully wear mask work, shows far she’s come, but, example,
She’ll put hair ponytail take least five times leave alone. 
Things like increasing. That’s true 😂 throat hurts.

As precaution, isolate my
House protect family ? Yeah, vaguely semantic, make case [US never reduced daily new cases low periods increase, like, say, Trump went Wharton, Bush went Harvard/Yale, guy Stanford admin... Ivy League educations impressive again? Lol yea exactly. Shut fuck up. rebuttal. Buckle up, get way way worse. example, Queensland outbreak months ago girls went Melbourne declare it. got police training facility bunch close contacts infected trainer. 

The Qld health minister asked 83 entire households isolate 14 days - did. outbreak completely contained everyone come contact infected person already quarantined got it.

So, zero community cases get live normal life (except international travel). compare directly Australia, gonna look good.

I intention so, reasons stated: dumb, poorly supported, meaningless generally useless comparison explain anything good dumb bragging, clickbaity titles karma whoring. broadly, think it'd best avoid country-to-country direct comparisons entirely. There's many variables play.

As said, undervalue Australia's response, awesome.

And again, would quarantine hotels borders open. We're going back square one. European countries cannot afford keep borders closed indefinitely, policies necessarily yield results. never late. fourth wave Croatia already? Anyone good information efficacy/speed Antigen testing vs nasal swabs? successful Reddit/google searching. put two tests 1 package say: Blow twice 99% accurate result. Problem solved. sure seem think good thing keep exposing inability understand things read. say much credibility here. live? Mask adherence 100% indoor environments major metropolitan area live. Personally, like see future. able pull kids school everything shut due seeing happening Europe shit, Italy leapfrog UK countries. Yes, I’m Colorado things aren’t nearly bad Midwest I’m preparing it. Starting making mental health priority every day getting away news taking walk. Also I’ve really tightened budget. I’ve increased emergency fund savings second lock absolutely get laid Furious redditors trying find contradictory article right now. good news stand! Nah probably doesn’t head feel like say anybody time year would true this.

That said, look forward Halloween parties next year.

Heard pass for, among things, Corona safety concerns. Yes Americans forced drink shitty homemade alcohol Yeah, country needs grow fuck stay fuck home finally ride past nonsense. 

That also includes fools host attend presidential rallies. Hehe yeah Texans say that. New Yorkers yell suffocated death lungs filled fluid? ad hominens okay it, cry it! much education politics history like making panicky hyperbolic statements!

lol okay dude Much slowly flu, though. also, Sars-Cov-2 quite stable spike protein. “The creatures outside looked pig man, man pig, pig man again; already impossible say which.” Coronavirus keeps people business, point. 

We gone bar restaurant since March, used go multiple times week. places open, want go. opening Tenet cinemas worldwide met largely empty theaters people willing risk health entertainment.

If look successful countries easily see strict lockdown allows economy actually recover... Whereas countries rushed lockdown still deep shit half year later. Ah see , plus positive tests test pcr symptoms double check includes going protests participating riots, right? many turkeys make? 5 people last year still managed eat half turkey (a small one though). would much rather President Camacho right now. It’s even close Great shitpost bro. going 80%! Please ask reconsider. Respect Family Well, first, obligated get tested. private transportation there's reason otherwise leave home, appropriate self isolate without test symptoms abate. miss bunch cases anyways, like need particular counted. 

Secondly, situation need leave house, like job, try reasoning boss first, fails, demand positive test giving leave, gonna get tested. Ultimately, less dangerous everyone take public transportation rather every day plus going office entire time sick. mask strictly distance- public health recommends prevent asymptomatic spread, works symptomatic spread well. Must dense nose hair think protect microscopic virus particle Unconstitutional. Won’t hold up. 

Sorry king old people killer Cuomo First know Trump probably lied mentioned vaccine way last debate could ready weeks. bit trueness that? vaccines close? Yup say ignorant history. said ignorant parralels noted experts field cited them. know, substance, something failed put forward all. Add reading comprehension list failures. get masters Trump U, chance? people, lockdown tacked onto end self-imposed lockdown.

I'm Colorado. I'm right things, along, running dogfight family it. 

We currently 1 level ""shelter place"" currently can't congregate groups 10 (5 Denver proper). Further, can't congregate groups 2 households. 

I accept logic limiting 2 households......as long households 1 exempted. I'm pretty salty this. correction: going away unless reach herd immunity (which might never happen reinfections shown us catch virus month, mutated version virus right away, covid might become second seasonal flu vaccine often stay immune, would even bet pharma companies provide blend flu covid vaccines future) vaccinate vulnerable people rest us sweat home go back normal life. anyone else panicking possibility second lockdown?

Where live, widely considered one ""good"" states. government pro-lockdown, seems inevitable. stand possibility repeating March, seems happening places every passing day. do?? little ones aren’t wearing masks. country choose control borders.

You correct - policies, geography determine success here. ... really need make assumption? dunno, Mitt Romney drew line way, way earlier Republicans even voted impeach Trump. I’m worried Utah Hoping things improve stay positive. ""the current administration"" side saying flu jan/feb want people get distracted impeachment. entire government blame, letting one party get away counterproductive. remember people first started worrying it, fucking articles media trying downplay it, people calling trump racist started closing borders, like every single person collectively forgot happened.  going flag post, convinced me. Funny enough, ask average American ""freedom"" means, chances good they'll invariably give definition ""selfishness"" instead. I’m confused anything here, I’m actually completely convinced keeping covid restrictions 2022 would disastrous policy-making. might make sense concern world covid-prevention, inconveniently also many aspects health life would negatively affected policy. Fortunately, Fauci advisor actually policy-maker ad hominens okay it, cry it! much education politics history like making panicky hyperbolic statements!

lol okay dude Parents: Open schools! kids aren’t learning, socializing playing sports!

School districts: Ok, let’s start hybrid learning navigate returning staff students school safely in-person.

Parents: No, like that. one thing keep mind Illinois hitting record infection numbers today possible hit numbers even higher back beginning could barely test several hundred people day.


However, back Illinois along many states implementing strict rules help control spread. far seems like everyone holding implementing type measures back March/April. think everyone waiting election hammer drop start seeing states implementing stricter rules.


These numbers going get worse worse. Either going see shutdowns deaths/hospitalizations climb high scares people back hiding. general economic well-being Sweden always better Cololmbia. comparing apples oranges there. Swedes higher amount compliance government suggestions, factor necessarily going full lockdown. way life Sweden far normal even without full-scale lockdown. scare problem I’m trump fan, fucking hate way blm protests (riots cases) don’t get scrutiny would inclined fear IMHE prediction end February understated. Travel risk factor, although think much top risk factor we're facing US. arrived places, many better protocols place. example, arrived Liberia, everyone leaving plane temperature checked. Everyone wearing mask, hand-washing stations front every building entire city, enormous compliance public health recommendations. one reasons they've less 200 cases country since beginning pandemic: started acting end January. tragic past experience Ebola, knew take seriously acted appropriately.

Liberia... 3rd lowest per-capita GDP world.. Literally one earth's poorest nations... Kicking ass pandemic.

US misplaced priorities ... posted article. Thank input. Yeah. OCD doesn’t revolve around hand washing. stereotype really impede diagnosis.

The pandemic definitely affected OCD though. Reduced triggers increased others.

I think it’s fair say around good time people. many undetected Covid cases Texas? confirmed 100k active cases Texas population 29M. Back June health officials estimating ten undetected cases every confirmed case. sake alarmist (and since testing improved) let's generously assume 1:1. Also, 80% Covid cases estimated mild asymptomatic.

With odds, sample 31 random people TX, there's 8.3% chance least one would coronavirus. one twelve chance family gathering contain one person Covid. well, Saturday woke hungover went get tested. people getting tested everywhere. went home plate good beef goulash, good hungover. see, stupid, cooperate.

That's how. Thanks Abbot righteous prick try say using ACE2 receptor, original SARS like 10 years ago used transmission route, remember ""deadly"" study try state kink/cleavage site glycoprotein tricks bodies furin cleave chunk glycoprotein shuttle directly cells direct cellular fusion. tranmission route pneumonic flus... 

But still isolated...

Go look effects stages lyme disease compare COVID, heart blood vessel damage telling part COVID made seem unreal, even tried pretend fucking HIV components it, fucking nuts.

**BUT GOT BRO, SAFE COVID HOME READING ANYTHING WATCHING DISNEY +**, worry, just, sit back relax. WA state -- saw kids trick treating last night. wife's parents (Colorado) live neighborhood agreed kids within neighborhood could trick treat. set system socially distanced trick-or-treating, along roster names kids neighborhood... werent list, tough shit. names accounted for, shut everything went inside night. Kinda genius, honestly. Yes, freest countries world called ""socialist"" ones. nordics New Zealand make top 5. False. able quote me. So, add ""liar"" list ways bad this. Looks like interesting show.
Added list. help work, customers. prevalent covid is, fewer customers going feel safe come.

Oh okay lol 44. live dark red zone (7day 179 per 100k). get wear masks nose pull mask public transportation (i sit sometimes 30-35min thing) wear dräger mask. Funny looks sometimes care. also high risk solution. want waste things looks like overkill. estimate gets pushed back herd immunity crowd successfully implements strategy. See current numbers. sure confused. even close, 20% IFR super flu.  realize fluoridation monstrously conceived dangerous Communist plot ever face? suppose that’s true. work finance clear objectives I’m surprised Senior Management team anti wfh.

I know teachers Spring. suspect majority them. make fair point related objective measurable metrics us metrics still trudging office risking covid exposure/spread. Regards Ljubljana, Slovakia Yeah waste money pretty much thats sad fuck. damn.  People dying due virus people going hungry. Sounds better me. Trump took it? Nah means work find data cases percentage actual tests administered? 

[Click `Tests 1m pop` keep saying US control, terms large population, really seem like daily cases.

It does. Take UK example.

Similar tests per million:

- UK: 492,168
- US: 435,694

Twice number confirmed cases per million:

- UK: 15,218
- US: 28,455

So similar levels testing almost twice number cases US. UK considers situation severe enough month long lockdown order. Yeah non-American think pretty likely T#ump win second term well. realise actually inconsistent comment 🙃What mean seems T#ump would rather let spread get worse loses works (and winner) whereas wins care anyway ignore done far anyway.

I certainly agree comment people 'secretly' supporting T#ump think larger people often realise polls. 

Note: obfuscated T#ump last time mentioned name comment removed here. call folks Illi-Bamams PERSONALLY start giving fuck Same. Miss going gym interacting community. Restaurants, too. I’ve lost bit muscle mass stayed slim walking lot cycling nice days. isn’t worth going people aren’t wearing masks working we’re hotspot now. aware that

So, someone says: “schools closed Europe”

And respond saying two prominent European countries keeping school open despite lockdown

It relevant reply doesn’t automatically make dumb American

For instance, say : “America closed schools”

And say: Texas Florida schools open

It would relevant reply Holding vaccines? Sure. leg stand anyone says “2022 earliest could achieve semblance normal” (paraphrasing Fauci here) touch reality. statement alone enough make lose respect him. It’s completely unrealistic completely unwarranted. county? grew Hudson, fell apart fairly quickly years later ôh mý gÓď! čaň špék šľóvak Right?! things learn midst pandemic! northeast done first part. cooperation people either test positive, contact positive, issue.

As right painful sore throat, headaches, mild fever, zero sense taste. really odd, something I've never experienced life. Breathing alright, now.

I've gone gym 5-6 days per week last several months, wore mask entire duration time spent indoors, literally everywhere except home, finally got girlfriend lackadaisical. grateful experts made sure years ago stop Ebola spreading control early on. level shows nearly enough people tested. wonder infection rate would could test everyone. can’t wait get healthcare. Especially this. career destroyed 5 years It’s acting like typical RNA virus, mutate slowly flu, could still impact vaccine development.

It’s stable way DNA virus like smallpox is. quiet Europe actually got cases late spring summer, they're getting fall/winter spike. important health care system going collapse they've summer build theirs. B R U H Schools didnt cause it, sturgis read headlines here? Reinfection proof imperfect immunity, data suggesting although immunity isn’t perfect everyone, people it’s quite substantial came home bucket white wall paint. drunk, tripped spilled paint place. hey! bad! missed sofa clean place sit admire fuck made!

It's clusterfuck. Yes, measure work, go lockdown means already fucked royally.

The government put hammer 1.July according criteria. started implement laughable measures end September. 

Now positive test % close 20%. government capacity 40k/day May. 50k. Maybe end year expand 80k. average 25% normal healthcare cancelled. hospitals much planned operations cancelled. Contact tracing limited people form high risk group. !%@# still (2 months now) wondering mandate wearing masks. refused accept kids transmit virus half middle schools infected, 10% clusters even. recently moved back Charleston/Huntington region WV getting laid Covid company failing. level disregard virus insane; know fact bars cities packed limit friends said drove them. went ate mother, brother, Step Dad yesterday sheer amount people neighborhood trick treating going door door insane. daily average 400 probably gonna get blown water next days. clicked link. circles back somebody commenting story. bit think lie? caught coronavirus died? young man life ahead died. think that’s terrible tragedy. even remotely close.   far worse could imagine. 

Unless national mask mandate immediately potential Italian April every county U.S.  Case Fatality Rate (CFR) Italy close 10%.  get 20 30 Million cases hospitals overwhelmed , hospitals overwhelmed CFR skyrocket, could easily 2 3 Million dead months. 

Don't forget flu spreading alongside COVID, someone gets doubt even hospital would save them, could easily see CFR get close 18%. Fair point. American parlance, understand *desertion* mean “the action illegally leaving armed forces.” yeah, overall notion willful abandonment absolutely makes sense me. Musta got one test packs Costco. think Governor side city, would tall order. reality, doubt happens. science clear though. everyone house arrest style lockdown even full 10 days, almost one could emerge contagious others. symptoms tested home end period, would weed might gotten someone else home. would scientifically impossible testing rate drop almost nothing.

&amp;#x200B;

There true serious lockdown anywhere western world. Yes, would need let people prepare provisions, grocery workers turned contactless shopper/deliverers, done. I’m expert, meter looks like [dactyl, trochee, trochee, trochee]. iambs sight. “This” might proof immunity. Reinfection proof immunity. Reinfection proven virus changes quick would hard get one twice compare. No. developed MERS. Moderna’s development forever bird flu/Zika. J&amp;J major leg they’re company approved vaccine based around specific platform used develop COVID vaccine (They EU approval Ebola vaccine based Ad26 vector summer)  we'd respect knowledgeable human beings equal could learn view pitable African savages shit-hole countries.../s Isn’t coke whore from.....? oh no, shithole country slovenia. valved.  Indeed it’s taking least two weeks seeing reports reinfection little 30 days. could Huh?? somehow think European countries borders? economy based tourism exports global depression, using GDP measure health system success isn’t useful. Let joke please. outbreak Australia nowhere comparable. started Europe never big manageable. virus already circulating Europe winter november/december 2019 exploded February/March worst period virus season Europe. Europe couldn’t prepare unlike Australia impossible stop first wave. France recording 1000 deaths/day beginning April Australia even 5 deaths. big difference linked fact outbreak far smaller time Australia, started go bad weeks Europe. Australia time prepare also lucky. managed well lockdown avoided beginning big outbreak. I’m one biggest pro mask pro lockdown people sub. And, you’re wrong.

It’s simple.

You can’t ask people stay home, without providing people government aid. Without providing businesses communities government aid.

The problem is, we’ve government taking action holding end.

Lockdown without government aid would cause harm virus. need strong government support. It’s simple.

So want see us done end this, better vote. one side already declared strategy let virus wash us reach herd immunity. win, won’t another lockdown won’t government aid. probably 85-90% compliance without them
In hk 90% compliance made formal mandate. Small randomised control trial replicated larger studies would effective treatment currently available. 

There are, course, mass studies showing vitamin levels lower severe covid cases, also study showing cells dont activate vitamin levels low.

There number ongoing trials wont join uk trial regard level supplementationa lwo. also looking vitamin preventive measure, treatment. I'll look CDC one larhger Spanish study is, think, following pilot. legal leak emails UK? No, rocket science. Lots places different guidelines different levels adherence ""unchecked"" spread, clearly there's two options.

Not rocket science. good, pointing things differ widely -- I'm familiar differences myself! Better things keep track ;) 

Stay safe :) ▪▪~ Lol. started wearing one February people made fun me. area pretty good mandate soon it’s dropped compliance drop people get tainted. next county doesn’t mandate people give shit wear one now. US 693 deaths per million. France 529 deaths per million. US third wave patting back 'doing better right now' Europe second wave. True may certain European countries, given choice I'd still go lower deaths per million.  

And worth noting countries hear lot about, UK, France, Sweden, particularly bad. Germany quietly laughing 124 deaths per million, example. saying fair comparison, let's get hasty 'Europe' generalizations.  70%, supposed round 2 testing next week. that’s 91% maths. Knowing 91% cases far better knowing 1 25 like countries. Thank helps. anxiety given shortness breathe virus. Makes pay attention breathing causes abnormal breathing patterns. 

But thanks again. need take xanax tough rest out. I've asked ""muh freedom "" compatriots point would consider lockdowns reasonable? virus killed 2% infected? 10%, 50?. think would never consider lockdowns reasonable. stopped speaking them. reinfections. body clearing virus particles uninfected. People retesting positive 30 days? It’s bad tests riot language unheard, something. Slovakia Western best shopping safely, naturally.  City council could fire doesn’t toe line.

That judge could jail contempt court. still can't get comment age demographic sole victim huh?  Also, death penalty drug possession certain amount. Makes sick. Chicago talking banning people Michigan

Really? reverse, Illinois double Michigan's daily positives. glad someone gets it.

Not gets it, fapped it. Fair points, all, well said. 

Which reminds me, [masks also reduce viral load, meaning folks get covid-19 generally milder time also means fewer hospitalizations fewer deaths.  Almost Asia pacific countries really well didn’t actually lockdown like Europe needed to. Keep trying flog misinformation makes feel better, could lock countrymen made sacrifices Victorians Australia. worries, ministry orange assured us we’ve turned corner. would hope calibrate account skin vs. internal temperature. know do, yes they're 100% useless.

I also wonder they've ever caught single case. fever always present *with* symptoms, asymptomatic cases significant think, temp scan catch small fraction cases. 

I've started making habit asking person scanning temperature they've ever someone read high get turned away. gotten yes yet. many factors driving mortality rates.

There LOT cases health care workers researchers learned from. Mask wearing reduce seriousness infection. people taking Vitamin supplements. Elderly people health conditions isolating cautious. people developed partial immunity.

And good news, still thousands people dying every day. it? don’t think so. Well could impose fines government institutes it. I’m saying fines. Ultimately walk fine line closure whole economy rights wellbeing individuals something doesn’t care individuals economy. Ngl one best summers while. remote work, spent felt like three months vacation. like covid never existed lmao.

So yeah we’re pseudo lockdown don’t think people would accepted locked summer. June, 2 months lockdown new cases numbers really low. link. click it. click read post that, great detail sources, shows OP's ""heartbreaking"" post propaganda lie. asia-pacific model? spongebob episode mocking texas borders CZ closed like 3 weeks now. going inside grocery store? enough people around mask deniers could nurses? apparently watch German news reports read newspapers. daily topics Germany going wind paying lot medical care eastern neighbor countries going need.

Slovakia tested half entire population today, 1% positive rate, btw. Polish bit stubborn accepting German offers help. mean time Belgian Dutch hospitals full, we're taking best chances survival.

Not bad country 83 million people, living space half size Texas. vast majority people get wearing mask, avoiding wearing masks. need 100% protected population stop virus spreading. need probably 75%. almost everyone wearing sort face covering keeping getting others faces, even would completely halt virus. Eh? F Nah, weak knuckle needs done. wanna lockdown either mate, time listen adults. would argue both, lol. wanted point since original poster made look like guy depressed quarantines lockdowns. Damn man, get extra workforce even PPE needed? I’ll wear one flu season. Managed quarantine arrival. enough restrict travel need put everyone arriving managed hotel strict control two weeks, even negative test.  I’m sure Europe, they’re idiots. US make entirety one 2 political parties. think math strong point  Partial measures incomplete, definition. aren’t enough. 

Like said:

Follow guidelines **or** face unchecked spread possibility eventual lockdown. 

It isn’t rocket science. information these? caught early-ish Europe’s first wave, July blood test showed antibodies still... would curious variant had. mean extended first wave right?  meant harsh discourage type behaviour. people acted responsibly needed. Lower risk even single-use mouthpieces. someone comes emergency room find injuries speeding, give lower priority treatment something stupid? someone comes overdosed illegal drugs, person downgraded treatment nature problem? someone injured rock climbing without proper equipment training, consider eligible best care lack wisdom? No! That’s time manner punishing people wrong making bad decisions. post going blow face hard, get started bombshelter garbage get upvoted? ""most americans ain't shit?"" really? graceful prose here. masks = distance, reduce far aerosols spread. distance mean constant lockdown closures, sorry that's possible, that's American thing, that's whole world thing. sounds like dosage working brilliantly levels still low, hence suggesting different formulation might work better. sprays come various strengths, least uk. happy relatively low levels vitamin stick it. dont claim expert - vitamin levels considerably higher I'm happy mine. Dude closed borders Australian states.

Leadership needed missing. Tegnell said Finland's state epidemiologist good idea keep schools open ""slow spread virus enough prevent hospitals overwhelmed"" right? /s       
Sorry I'm influenced foreign media politicians, moment thought praising [herd Entitlement. disgusting thing. Almost disgusting dismissivenness. combination, sadly, frightfully common west. meant hypothetically- assuming everyone assistance, would concerns things mentioned. worded poorly! lockdown every winter then? 6502? Like C64 old? dog whistle. excuse really want- wearing masks-by calling question early advice.

They really good finding inconsistencies taking things context support actions. They're testing 12-18k people per day. people morons. CDC source keep getting outbreaks, locking down, getting another outbreak.. many times going giving up? El Paso bad place far US population centres comes logistics using neighbouring surge capacity. wish best luck. reimburse Americans seized property 

You're talking 1960s. reimbursement offered good enough Canada. United States, hand, still holding entire country accountable actions dead people. Time let go. I’m trying understand it’s hard. people France stay lockdown forever even successful lockdown, people Victoria ? South Korean study largest found 1/3 retested positive, symptoms, period went 2 months recovery. unable cultivate live virus found known infections stemmed ""reinfections'. likely relapses brought post viral issues dead virus fragments. China Italy, btw, patients tested positive well 90 days. got link effectiveness number? Well, autocratic whole time (think Stalin). anything think gotten marginally less so, there's actual protest critical intellectual culture now, despite occasional state-imposed repercussions it. idea entirety USA Savannah, GA. Can’t argue that. Truth! amazes many folks west willing take risks. Perhaps cautious view due higher risk profile average young healthy individual, even still 21 perfect health think I'd screwing around.

This caused much suffering many people responsibility play safe end soon possible. So, let's talk facts, think facts, downvotes, way deal fear.

Between various vaccine candidates likely approved soon, 60k people already received them. (Not placebos, actual vaccines.) 

The big fear vaccine Guillain-Barre syndrome. things potential concerned with, that's big one. invariably shows within 2 months. 

None vaccine candidates going get EUA full cohort vaccine least two months. top that, smaller subset (numbers 3-4 digits) trial volunteers vaccine much longer, participated phase 1 2 trials conducted May June. 

A single case transverse myletis (like GBS, TM condition related immune system attacking nervous system) potentially enough stop Oxford/AstraZenica vaccine dead tracks regulators believe coincidental. 

But let's pretend coincidental. Let's thought experiment. Now, I'm going put hand scale here, resolve every ambiguity favor ""more dangerous."" let's assume two people (out 15k got vaccine, placebo) placebo group. know true not. Let's assume neither special risk TM (we know false, we're establishing upper bound here). Lastly, let's assume two case TM caused vaccine (which almost certainly weren't, else trial would halted - continued regulators believe TM *not* caused virus). 

2 15000 = 1 7500 = .013%. (Not 1.3%, .13%. .013%). 

Oh, and, btw, people experienced TM survived. that's even death rate. That's worse-case scenario serious complication rate. 

I know *feels like* vaccine rushed, development testing been. starters, head start thanks SARS MERS outbreaks. Studies viruses identified spike protein target antibodies. Secondly, amount resources thrown trials unusually large, actually approval process exactly same:

When developing HPV vaccine, massive trial, gave thousands people vaccine thousands placebo, waited. certain number placebo group contracted HPV, compared two groups. vaccine trials work. 

Now, HPV, took years, mostly give vaccine people yet sexually active, wait - may take years become sexually active, get exposed HPV. basically set trial motion sit hands. 

With coronavirus, we're middle pandemic. Basically, 15k people hot zone got vaccinated placebo, 150 get coronavirus two months passed (whichever longer) compare placebo group trial group. people getting thousands people getting coronavirus day, trigger that, HPV vaccine, took years going take months. 

(Judging way Moderna talking it, strongly suspect *already* necessary number people placebo group contracted coronavirus they're waiting, per FDA request, entire cohort vaccine two months). 

I understand vaccines scary people, that's okay - inundated false information dangerous years. actually understand process, easy see meaningful corners cut here. I'm happy hear different idea! need different ideas everyone tired old idea switching back forth ""everything open business usual"" ""we announce massive lockdown starting 3 hours"". Hope different idea yields different results. Hopefully Victoria gets another big outbreak killing distopian lockdown dream. get flu shot every year.   flu.  consider readily accepting... clarify, meant results coming back ""current approach insufficient"" ratcheted measures quickly, ultimately levels seen. afraid that, respect that.  people? Surely quarantining all? wow unwatchable holy shit &lt;Cries wonder people trusting governments keep moving goalposts like this? literally lack beds. staffed beds. People need start bringing spare beds hospitals...

/s Fucking Republicans kill us Excellent article. Thank OP. love know debates lockdowns

What would like debate? One side numbers backed studies experience (see NY much Asia) showing lockdowns gets bad (because people bothered wear masks yet) save lives help end sooner, selfishly whines personal freedoms slightly limited.

¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ much information require.  30k people vaccinated.  serious adverse effects would heard.  Maybe one case Astazeneca.   Way way better odds get covid, given age health.  Shoot juice me, bruce.  Put gallon Allen. actually couldn’t care less it. care need do. I’m glad hear you’re part problem, you’re good company there.
So ‘pricks’ break rules? Hopefully China gets another big outbreak soon kills lockdown dream. Basically. Since Russia moved communism autocracy fits. cases, nuanced rhetoric would imply. difference Russians fucking stupid enough fall this.

'Wait, sent us radiologist advice? dermatologists busy diagnosing foot fungus?' Deaths? way never half assed lockdown though

I mean, really correct. 2nd wave, wasted couple weeks trying localised lockdowns, went Stage 3 lockdown 3 weeks went Stage 4 point. half-assing would meant going straight Stage 4. figured weeks needed go elimination rather suppression, first month felt like wasted time.

I live Melbourne I'm relieved happy current numbers achieved looking forward summer I'm also tired Victoria brought perfect response second wave. Yes, done well now. lot mistakes made. Contact tracing, PPE, quarantining, aged care, communication, etc things took lot time improve (which frustrating feels like first lockdown wasted like many places) better addressed, lockdown may shorter. Pretending issues important means learn anything this.

And fair compare whole countries Victoria anyway. Victoria able get support states already eliminated it. able increase testing capacity help labs states, healthcare workers fly help places, essential businesses able reduce staff without big impact life relying states well (for example, meatworks abbatoirs working smaller capacity affect food supply extra sent SA, mail redirected sorting Sydney, etc). definitely things learned Australian response, think oversimplifying compare much.  Sorry hear friend, hope joke poor taste. Best luck hope find better relationship near future. saying Washington Post article written way make situation Indonesia sound worse is? intents purposes, China it.

And epicentre. Literally hit main transit hub, right before/during national holiday sees people travel other.

They've since *other* holidays mass migrations relative normalcy. Yes, strategy involves testing millions dozen cases pop up, Europe US want consider world leaders, done same? lot people scared future comes things. They're distrustful large institutions like governments, honestly get that; polticial institution able probe worthy people's trust lately. 

A lot also may want brush conspiracy theories easily, lot fact quite plausible. 

TL;DR, comes fear asymptomatic silent spreader harbor SARS virus months keep spreading it? evidence? Sure, ones you’ve chosen. 😂 Honestly covid19 incubation period long hiv would better off. time knew something happening world would infected making lockdowns pointless. beds full, 

Rationing care starts \*long\* beds full. 1 ICU bed left 80year old comes Covid give ICU bed (you probably rarely even normal times, extremely good health). reason know healthy 10year old going come later day. keep bed open. know shit texas getting bad sheriff's get board. Normalized US population that’s almost 4,500 per day. Y'all, risk getting COVID grab beer friends appease family member holidays.

It's risk death; several us dealing long-lasting effects. see r/covidlonghaulers .

If us could stay indoors weeks, perhaps right ship yet. Lady Liberty subtly corrupting influence comes preventing pandemic... many cases, mutation rate slow far viruses go. cytoplasmic helps greatly also error checking activity nsp14. one deluding here. know covid eliminated, know 7 total cases week (which Victoria) far better 725 cases day. numbers low get new case, contact isolate case's close contact, also close contacts close contacts. that's saying something.  Life us close normal because: response new threat was

This incorrect overgeneralization. Plenty people drink vodka way tastes. certainly experienced dealing hardship understanding importance protecting oneself.  Anti-Vaxxer.   Go away, hang Jenny McCarthy.

Absolutely. I'll take soon can, whichever one available. ignorance. El Paso county hospitalizations many entire states. 2018 without lockdown
2020 lockdown. aren’t gunna happen seems problematic terms political bias. Valid point, EU actually -- per-capita new infections scale -- worse. current outbreak quite intense! Yeah. Given fact matterhorn despite lockdown tells different story. still trying push weak argument, actually face merits? 

We know ever vaccine opening heroes Victora asked ensured rest country open up. 

You know virus comes back? chief medical officer tells us country children. Attempted murder charges them! Take seriously. 400 whole lot? think w.virginia large population. Well let people get sick die then. going care listen despite months non-stop warnings longer problem. people listen see dead bodies sidewalks even they'll think they're special resistant. Clearly part ""vulnerable population"". Same. You’re bright one aren’t ya already pretend virus woke mass protests spread (which may help explain places like california getting screwed too). Pretending schools spread thing. want pretend like things feel important risk factors. lie. per capita rate high SD?  Guffaw. incredibly misleading poorly written article. Looks like died accident, self harm long haul COVID. middle article:

""'We broken hearted adventures came end Bangor University studying degree Chinese language looks like tragic accident.'"" usually college student even I’m campus it’s risk go large event bc expulsion lol  Honestly, nearly enough contact tracers country get contacts 25,000 people traced isolated. Czechia contact tracing already failing spectacularly measly 13,000 cases per day (double population). Still, judging week's results Orava Bardejov, first round testing week ago, could profound impact. let's hope people run discipline throughout weekend start throwing massive parties come monday. Lockdowns going work unless regional (ie: multi-state) people given significant amount money via direct payment exchange cooperation. You’re wanting Cuba America? sounds you’re talking everything US past 120 years think get one week window Christmas buy gifts visit family. numbers anywhere near low enough open already beginning December. I'm even gonna talk countries significantly ahead curve compared us, sort expectation four weeks enough smokescreen many countries allow suing damages punitive damages decided jury?  loser pays legal fees rule? Rounding curve..of circle. disagree. new yorker, stopped many members family &amp; friends &amp; co-workers &amp; self travelling  Already visitors Sacramento  see number people suggesting deny services take precautions. 

That's reality e.g. smoker means non-smoker gets priority transplant recipient queue. shortage, care (organ case) given one would use best/longest. 

Even universal healthcare, limits meaning rationing. 

I think ever feasible situation e.g. deny anti-maskers care similar (Who would make investigation, doctors? make antimaskers antivaxxers carry armbands different colors?)  Americans regard science magic.

They wont follow scientific advice mitigate behaviour pop pill anything, can't even fucking decide Government govern us. I'm absolutely wit's end everything... Czechoslovakia isn’t thing anymore, mate Correct, get used abused talking point disengenuous agitators United states. Probably large portion population decides it.

Bars packed parties raged city last night. would say get pass winter peak less rear view mirror. would cop get decide laws wants enforce? whole point lawmakers judiciary? would like letting individual soldier decide want go war with.  Here's latest case/death charts Arkansas, running 7-day 63.87 deaths per 100k population. ranks 21st per capita currently ranked 5th 7-day average deaths (hot whole Caribbean, frankly, less boat. built entire culture economy around hospitality, expats, tourism, they’re getting beaten hard supposed right thing. Massive respect state Premier, Daniel Andrews, held 120 consecutive daily press conferences ""pressers"" often hostile media.

How hostile? See Bishop describes ""ghastly"" pressers Murdoch's Sky News Dan"" etc refer premier. regularly report dismay too, ""Victorians yet ready slam Dan"" polls come back though, balls man give face pressure. media, Federal govt reduced support payments throughout, largely according schedule set long earlier, seemingly attempt starve state giving opening up.

Can believe it, can't believe much harder many made be. did. Overall less deaths.

Arizon higher number retirement homes NYS does. 

New York State leads deaths. 

Don’t know numbers looking incorrect. still testing, im US midwest finally got “you passed preliminary screening lets get in” phase 3 signed for. oxford Ah unfortunately problem. ignorance non-compliance safety measures killing ignorant, killing stay safe, too. might report workplace. Makes total sense compare magnitude response needed entire US country similar size single state. sister town months ago saw God Bless Trump billboard bolted. She’s pritzker appointee gets harassing messages work cell anti-covid people. somehow got cell number threaten send immune blood her. Weirdos. 😳🤦🏼‍♀️  Oh, could much worse this. lethality pretty low compared truly lethal highly infectious virus could do.

This shows even less lethal ones big problem well ones offer long term immunity stick around long time.

There lots viruses lethal infectious, kind get survive become immune like smallpox measles.

This one different get immune long vs getting immune life, rather big difference there, still often overlooked problem.

We lucky lethality higher really, high infection rate lack immunity along level lethality clearly bad enough.

But oh yeah nature come far worse viruses this, think big difference much travel population amplifying infection rate virus like this. guess there's probably coronavirus pandemics past way detect pandemic caused virus human history. Good question. [epidemiological] standpoint, infectious disease standpoint, understanding dynamics virus, always expected fall would troublesome time. think community, sort caught us surprise. struggled July, August time period. gone down. positivity rates low 4.5% early September, city really rejoicing that. think happened community, let guard. whether parts Juárez, [Mexico], neighbor sister city, experiencing spike, traffic Juárez 25% 30% year year. **I think multigenerational homes have, lot family gatherings, look sort globally population dynamics El Paso, one ZIP codes, 79938, actually one populous ZIP codes America. layer top, city health care, comorbid conditions, specifically diabetes, make combating [the] coronavirus difficult.** Actually shutting travel would start. Except cruise ships US hardly shut international travel. Bullshit! Therapeutics come along way! We’ve learned lot better prepared protect elderly risk. FEAR MONGERING MSM. People waking seeing never public health, rather systematic collapse economy power/control people. science win! El Paso still available ICU beds though. link? saw US head disease control Russian State TV saying everything fine. Doubtful; workplace even comply temporary Federal requirements. Serious question. comes lot early cases virus we're severe? many people played mild cases something else got it? Seems like every early case hear person ended hospital beds. leader local pandemic task force called it, worry ""space, staff, stuff."" Right there's widespread staffing shortage, covid upswing many places, can't import staff elsewhere.

In words, hospitals nearing capacity even though count licensed beds shows space. There's something called makeup think point? it’s like one company going “winner”. variety vaccines development stages prove safe probably used subset earth’s population. agree want minimize amount every bit helps.

the point 30 minute number meaningless. 10 minute number meaningless. Seriously, long take inhale... takes seconds maybe five seconds most. Let's generously assume 5 seconds, stilll mean air contact mask whole time... passing mask... long take one droplet air pass mas (0.1 seconds?) .  intended chemical mechanism relevant inhalation, would given numbers relevant timescale certainly less 5 seconds.  30 minutes 10 minutes relevant timescale breathing, relevant timescale virus gets trapped mask. . intended benefit likely get contaminated handling mask. hey benefit, one thinking of. We’re gonna die!! You’re correct!

Ever thought you’re genius maybe things make sense agree might flawed things don’t agree with? live New York, trust me, blame both. Cuomo ineptitude Trump literally stealing ventilators purchased. “DiCtAtOr DaN” hope humble pie tastes nice Ebola hard spread. John Oliver piece sheriffs show that's worth watch YouTube well, said one problems 52% (or 62%) run unopposed. Well happens original dates come, cases still rising? one worst USA. 

The Govenors even attempt lock state time year. 

Also, allowed Meat packaging plants continue operation, even though COVID outbreaks started there. Warehouse parties protected Charter Rights Freedoms /s  5 last 8 days 0 cases deaths Yeah fair typically use zoom setup via work. Big difference unemployment rates too. Sweden better anyone else, anymore. cases spiked massively well. economy shambles much anyone. they've locked current path.

Sweden Sweden. isolated voluntarily. North America can't order people isolate without losing minds, people complying anyways.

And failed anyways. *silence denialists*  Well, took poster mean bread broadly. We’re gonna die!!!! Medics clearly idea help people. USA tested 200k per 1 million people France. countries test UK Israel. there's anything criticize US testing. Probably higher.  stop overconfidently posting guesses. Yet 1,760,000 corona cases total whole continent. Even reported still way lower everyone else 

Ridiculously low compared US, Europe, Asia. antiviral hiv/malria drugs...if ""scientists"" werent greedy maybe time reexamine hydroxychloroquine You’re putting way much responsibility shoulders. hate we’ve pushed completely ridiculous grandma killer narrative. virus virus, it’s moral failing contract spread long you’re reasonably careful. mental health worth absolutely nothing? That’s fair yourself. Surely there’s middle ground throwing caution wind imprisoning yourself. Ah, yep! hear that. Prove Lol we’re gonna die!! already happening El Paso parts Wisconsin. Thanks much information. Keep mind Mexico second highest obesity world, there’s lots diabetes hypertension, sadly.

Argh: would me. 26 pounds since pandemic began, lot more! 19 go longer overweight.

I heard Anaferon; I'll look up.

Good luck yours! Covid pro-inflammatory properties result strokes, pneumonia, heart attacks, kidney failure, clots blood vessels. likely hit 300,000 deaths end year people undisciplined weaklings ready act stupid drop hat now.

I miss extended family much anyone wife works facility full Covid 19 patients. reaching breaking point now. ways can't predict right now. world unprecedented stress. virus could easily mutate virulent lethal form. people get infected, opportunities happen. Good time refrigerated truck company part wants say US never reach 200k cases US crossed 100k cases recently I'm terrified it'll go even higher whole situation changed know common cold Coronaviruses? Trump's government said open schools receive funding. That's not""advice"" calling negatives standard response US? Seems like waste time call someone tell they're actually fine.

Over Australia, negative result text message, positive phone call instructions isolate. Results usually next day experience, although waiting another day, especially we've testing blitz like occasionally here, big deal all. Yes here's Trump playing 4D chess again, everything individually policy cases perhaps increased prevalence disease make timeline. *points head* makes smart. laws cancelled summer travel plans nearby states (well within driving distance) testing/quarantine requirements, even though next enforcement. fear enforcement enough.

And yeah, I'm sure many companies would enforce too. really. 

Triage generally means sickest get priority. 

Combat Disaster triage means ones likely survive get priority. extremely high Sunday Utah. Like anybody wants go New York more... Bad mormons! Sociopathic? positive thread I’ve ever seen sub lol. positive vaccine announcement definitely glimpse light end tunnel problem. Hopefully amount testing positive starts going WI. NY feel pain. state seems hitting surge different point WI get crushed. Yep....

Triage = sickest people get care first

Combat triage = patients likely live, get care first Yeah, typo. Thanks Use sarcasm font going act stupid. Deaths barometer. people start dying numbers akin early spring you’ll see targeted lockdowns. 

So far deaths lagged really far behind cases 5 weeks since explosion cases deaths haven’t budged much. could change soon we’ll see. Legit live, sometime back April constructed 500 person emergency field hospital local convention center, stocked gills. area (and sorta hasn't) gotten hit hard totally went dismantled field hospital.  That's actually live. City become barren wasteland. People awful town nothing show anymore. Still one possible outcomes, goal. someone actually benefits financially lockdowns still them, take baffling me. people think everyone's desperate go stand register 7-11? People want see friends go tacos. BEGGING GO BACK WORK? Las Cruces tiny fraction size El Paso Albuquerque 200 miles away. allow lot wiggle room options using neighbouring surge capacity. No, actually miss anything crucial IMO.

I gonna called this, would expect see much impact normal year year pandemic. Even taken steps probably save life, think still enough late response much much worse consequences ones actually occurred. Georgia exporting patients North Carolina. scientists plan trying exploit this? Wait December bro, gotta change house Okay maths, Africa’s population like 5 times USA...  Yes, hopefully groups selected high risk individuals... Idk, probably find deaths millions people less topical viruses every year pretty big yawn. Given western society high percentage people refusing wear masks, dumbfounding think would adopt diseases fraction mortality rate I'm sure know better all.

More like I'm sure tremendous difficulty understanding people write. 1000? Pfffft. happened county live:  Franklin county? journalism dead crap journal puts crap articles? Seems bit overly-simplistic. I've keeping home past like 8 months. Get food stuff delivered, gone single non-essential trip, declined every social event, working remotely.

Feels like self-inflicted prison cell here, basically. I'm glad it, apologize regret it.

But tearing apart knowing everyone else still goes takes dumb risks. Makes loneliness depression stress feel like nothing.

I'm know right thing (which IS, according basic science common sense). sit trying safe, everyone else partying socializing hooking kinds stupid stuff, acting like they're great it.

Only thing keeping going want live guilt might infected, hurt, possibly killed another human being. Lest forget, thing spreads like crazy, even asymptomatically. I'm taking chances. want go grave knowing *everything* save lives around me. REFUSE guilt death permanently injury conscience.

And yet, here's everyone risking anyway, treat like shit want careful.

Why right thing damn frowned on?

EDIT: See, even post getting downvoted replied people trying guilt trip things I'm comfortable doing. Come on, guys.  pcr test positives, huge decrease pcr test demand  gonna let people even know breathe then

That paranoia sounds insane. Yes. I'm going go back normal soon possible. people coming breathing like kid hey Arnold? Lol. tired Sweden politicized. seen people basically hoping Swedes die prove concervatives explain Sweden lot, heard immunity strategy, life same. 

Sweden (and doing) fuck all, strategy admittedly herd immunity strategy, life anywhere. want let Michael Denny Denny Singers way? needs it?! always count chickens hatch? Idem, despise online classes every fiber soul made studies worse every single way possible, mean want schools re-open. case, I'll stop going. gonna risk family members risk donkeys think ""it harm youngsters fine"". Yeah fuck end them. happened lung infection. Ended ICU 13 days going hell treatment try save kidneys. dialysis year half need kidney transplant. Wear mask people, shit serious. I'm 43. Remember, remember, 5th November wont civil war, people outwardly break wont matter. effective plan then, particularly deadly virus 98% percent people. I’m even sure trying say here? expand mean? OK prelim, still shows good results, many others. 11 tested gives good chance work well. Maybe bit less likely. really mask others. really work parties wear them. Snapchat Instagram stories filled people partying bars tonight (ages 20-30). Pandemic going get worse here. lot people telling people stay home back April social distance smh. Texas even hardly report antigen quick tests

Tests numbers easy fake, like watch deaths. Texas 18th. Oh damn. Well again, good luck finding something else grateful chosen year move NZ know bad dude actively ordering that... Consider instacart similar service. 

Grocery shopping pretty dicey rn. people like always problem. sounds risk group. callous unconcerned vulnerable. lock again. wear mask everywhere go. love mask. staying home seeing anyone again. didnt help April. Lockdowns terrible lazy solution often dont even work. facts hold power here! Murca comment infringing RIGHTS AMERICAN surprised honestly much asymptomatic virus spreading.  went beach every weekend, able enjoy family company outside kids see grandparents, son could participate outdoor sports, could walk playground day week, could go friend's pool, talk family walks. gone winter replacements. This. work customer service deal public daily I’m fucking terrified idiots refuse wear masks they’re hurting others. Everything closed Coney Island Pessimistic, unrealistic however. 800-1K deaths day would 48k-60k deaths. total right 300k, certain. wear masks El Paso? 

Why would say retail stores significant community spread actually happen viral infection. sign unhealthy immune system. someone Mexico tell bad situation is?? China knew needed done. enough warning. bloodwork 16 lab draw take prescription vitamin pill week still barely range checked let go. believe family naturally Vitamin deficient. even offering voucher people returning UK overseas stay hotel. send home hope follow rules already burnt exhausted, add insufficient staffing top caring COVID day every day.....I started travel nursing COVID, taking crisis positions. sad see burnt everyone is. stop, 5 months I've enough. I'm proud Slovakia!!

Belgian here. borrow politicians? true. Like said though, forced press conference two days earlier planned. I’m saying understand late. That’s he’s getting me. current surge may chains transmission originating Sturgis. 

The problem contact tracing weak US coming firm conclusions difficult. Melbourne 2.2 cases daily 14 day average 1 mystery case Isn’t panic buying? Considering tests show negative early stages low viral load

For instance, infected waiting line get tested. won’t pretend I’m expert maybe argument primary schools, I’m sure. could argue parents picking children large groups may help tho. definitely spreads secondary schools imagine student goes home parents contained. let alone university students Literally locking Tories spent billions handing track trace contracts mates instead people competent enough get us back semblance normality. mention voting starve children amidst litany scandals. 

bUh iMaGiNe CoRbYn cHaRgE &amp; hahahaha  Well, non-essential shops, leisure centres pubs close certainly, expect working home. 

So real new compliance bit - people stop meeting socially outdoors. think probably yes, majority people. Yes countries UK separate nations (...arguably) different parliments set different rules. England setting rules affect Wales, Northern Ireland Scotland.

Wales went 17-day firebreak lockdown back 23rd October leave 9th November regardless what's happening England instance. 80 prematurely. Seriously looked list canadian deaths listed here...82, 95, 111. Literally every winter life Canada quasi-lockdown. Things barely changed life went lockdown March, change working home instead going office, welcome change far I'm concerned! late meeting would arse thrown onto street. different leader country? Anything contains basic logic really? thought fatality rate 3% horse bolted weeks ago. 

A circuit break may worked back then, advised. Implementing seems like UK deaths due slow uptake blow economy livelihoods too. politicians late stuff time. things criticize, gives fuck fact comment got downvoted dispiriting. see many recommended ranges vitamin D. bloodwork says 20-100, something like that. I've also seen 20-40 20-50 given ranges. comment aged well haha 3 new confirmed cases Hong Kong.

The 61 new asymptomatic carriers found Kashgar via second round full population PCR Yeah lol quit goalpost shifting Belgium. ""Very strict lockdown"" schools open businesses open, police way enforce rules effectively lockdown unless someone calls cops party. Ben Shapiro DESTROYS FACTS LOGIC Northern Ireland one wears masks legally Apparently 200 000 tests compared 300 000 day usually You

That's answer

You virus spreading.

The virus unable spread. spreading. spreading virus majority older fair. state 1717 deaths. 1100+ 80. 40 category 17 deaths one two pre-existing conditions. still sad. reality truly largely kill people 80. * New people tested: 132.279

U.S. still started mass manufacturing N95 general population wartime-like production. People think little cotton mask surgical mask allows get within 6 ft people crowded spaces-No, IMO. would wear masks outside. enforce inside public spaces outside dumb. Limit gathering sizes enforce social distancing. right thing do. Education important, important keeping entertainment venues, bars restaurants open. Sorry you’re really control you’re walking street someone decides walk right past you. gonna do? Jump road?

You can’t social distance outside lot cases, go high street weekend it’s packed. There’s reason wear mask, can’t flip every time might need it. 

If you’re outside there’s people it’s even relatively busy wear don’t full control well distanced absolutely refuse cut government slack, sitting pile weeks ago, idea last minute hodgejob really worries government control. Quite comparison lmao. far justified punishment far reasonable whatever reason universities emerging place spread young children looking less likely spread adults  Tbf it’s pretty useful metric US case numbers ones people familiar  We've virtual teaching 2 kids since March (with summer break). hard better alternative. Good luck! Ooh number solely covid ICU patients. thought total regardless reason ICU. welding doors shut tou get infectex ... that's ridiculous. Whether something issue country B entirely irrelevant whether issue country A. taught grade school. Never sure  quickly devolving back caveman times get gas station, grocery store, mall, diner... people don’t wear masks people wear masks noses chins. People regard fellow man. It’s kind selfishness that’s become indicative American condition. feel online uni classes suck ass. situation isnt getting better imagine next semester stuck rooms online tuition usual :( change healing you. Lol Aw poor baby can’t stay home? Grow entire point bringing curve make pandemic last longer. restrictions, faster rise fall. nothing hive mind invested in. Right now, science school spread out. know college age kids spread like wildfire, doubt cutoff right 18 even biological reason difference.

The thing gets much proves important teachers schools are, used relief parents work jobs even two jobs. crutch like this. fall reason really need close them. Fuck that. Teachers get paid enough put danger sake someone else's paycheck mental well-being. get paid enough teach safely barely that.

It right treat way, that's it, way people going realize what's right, try move away god awful system have, show people happens world fucking convenient. called pandemic, make excuses world, could black plague we'd still trying throw educators school staff front lines. hell getting downvoted?!? 'health officials' yet seemed oblivious 230k American lives lost pandemic. irony video-chatting safe ways celebrate Halloween obviously, SAFEST WAY celebrate all! JESUS, get grip, people! things keep opened vs closed based virus spread. There's - sometimes important - factors considered. look maps cases area see compliance good not. live Kent, went Drayton Manor August. get M1, less felt like COVID thing people knew about.

I idea case, certainly seems problem North. well, they're overwhelmed yet. must think developing vaccine easy using iPhone. Probably wherever promises are. I'm never going without one again. might saying others hear death rate x x amount people positive x amount died, hear, ""this virus spreading areas overwhelmed hospitals, areas won't, economic recovery far away, stay vigilant washing hands social distancing."" that's pretty much think go day.
I've known people passed away, friends infected. get people want gatekeep facts. tell people truth. assumption lockdown actually possible since virus contagious. 

Wait... thought Sweden's strategy based science, assumptions... Good them! So, wrong. dumb threatened smarter ones. either made really stupid election paradigm shift party—those embraced enabled believed “the future” party thereby latched prospects his—even though bereft ideas ethically compromised. None matters long smoke mirrors persist, could potentially take lot people loses. :(  course not. We’ll still get smacked around damage could significantly mitigated common sense measures half America refuses accept. Ugh Automod - I'll shorten original comment say lot q St. George color right Advice also need follow accept. Right I’m still sending kids school it’s open really need (I can’t arsed type welcome view previous comment mine did) I’m exactly helping either I’m hypocrite. I’m aware it, I’m aware point making acceptance hard. Without acceptance can’t really act. sick user name ;) Well officials plan worst case scenarios. I’m really not, refuse risk bringing home loved ones. Citation needed. False positives 
Low tolerances test kits
Multiple testing person equals multiple cases

Deaths  clue herd immunity covid even exists. Anyone throwing numbers guessing. many variables know.

It probably doesn't. never achieved herd immunity coronavirus naturally before. Yeah need mocked incessantly - polite presenting evidence encourages insincerity them. 

They accomplices murder reckoning believe. what? said hermit? might want take precautions care community. alcohol wipes? Life worth living get spend time friends family

also ain't worth living quit breathing Depends neighborhood setting.

The trashy people (loud fuck, probably bike and/or pitbull and/or actively abusing girlfriend selling cheese bought EBT card, possibly using world's shittiest chinese bluetooth speaker maxed out) rarely wearing masks trolleys buses superspreader trap horrible ventilation, nobody wants get stabbed orange cult member.

Grocery stores generally good, department stores like walmart lots dicknosers. Still tons people outside understandably rate pretty low there. colds caused rhinoviruses. probably not. caused coronaviruses OC43 HKU1 shown provide cross protection, tcell memory immunity. sterilizing immunity antibodies. still infected, may able mount defense easier. 

But likely caused rhinovirus. [30 Indians already infected. country high number Covid-19 infected population? Good article absolutely worth read. seems prudent. guys gonna kill many damn people don't.
At least Boris quite wilfully stupid trump. hospitalizations, ICU capacity, deaths? UK mandatory masks this? Everybody can. need realise saving lives bigger priority anything else right now, including financial stability. course ideally neither yes, economy jobs come second people dying. determine say people sacrificed save jobs. abhorrent idea. 

People don’t want really accept reality situation. pandemic, get want. virus holds cards really stripped back saving lives costs. 

The whole world rebuild done. Normality com back eventually survive. survive people stay heck home. Yeah think everyone states needs taxed $20 ""cold ones Vic fund"" guys deserve wtf waiting No. It’s never late. plan effectively executed across communities, some. country needs united, calm, persistent. cushy office job option unpaid days off.

So call sick, comes vacation pool. mouthed management twice 2019 I'll come sick matter spite. listen.

Anyway, I'm working home even though policy 3 WFH days per year everyone else back office masks. Dumb fucks. Even though flu vaccine perfect, reduce spread people. Getting vaccinated may also protect people around you, including vulnerable serious flu illness, like babies young children, older people, people certain chronic health conditions.

The flu vaccine also reduce symptoms even strains fully matched. Honestly there's massive amount flu vaccine, surprised covid vaccine effective flu vaccine massive improvement itself. Thank you! I’m tired paywalls news sites. Yeah Google apple mobility trends started decreasing businesses got shut down, people already going less fear. Eventually something clicks people stop socializing. f\*\*king moron, like half world apparently, feel need ruin entire world economy something barely life threatening flu. 

&amp;#x200B;

Do lockdown neighborhood every time someone gets flu nan die?

&amp;#x200B;

This isnt ebola virus/fungus/disease kills healthy young people droves, much every scaremonger twat wants believe otherwise, sometimes kills people things kill first, old sick/weak.

Herd immunity pretty much option lockdowns delay that. Similar situations exist across pond certain person surrounds sycophants. sympathize. (Not sure getting bot blocked) light on? so, that’s knocked door... 

Just finished Halloween never felt really uncomfortable. Outdoors, lots air flow, social distanced, masks, etc. best could kids blast really tough year safest environment could manifest family neighborhood. We've never achieved herd immunity coronaviruses, rhinoviruses, influenzas, etc...

I sure anyone expects achieve herd immunity one. Yes, herd ""resistance"" becomes immune suppressed endemic disease however long takes, always circulate. Herd immunity disease goes away pipe dream.

Also idea cross protection bringing us closer magic herd immunity threshold bogus. Cross protection coronaviruses provide sterilizing immunity, decreased symptoms. retransmission still possible.

All cross protection means people exposed coronaviruses like hCov OC43 hCov HKU1 may better equip fight infection novel coronavirus. Again, mean sterilizing immunity prevent infection altogether. bring us closer magic herd immunity number probably exist. diseases achieved natural herd immunity to. Plague Justinian one think of. interesting point, I'm convinced people would say less half 160 million deaths. Employers stand behind employees safety. People remember stores treated employees disposable. hope anyways. really think time treat people venomously possible still ""civil"" dangerous public health.  You’ve yee’d last haw Wonder serious must getting Johnson nationwide shutdown One thing everyone keeps telling pandemic: stay positive.  Wealth health would much snazzy Stocked beer bog roll today, case people start panic buy. definitely mind that, I've never seen receptionists wearing masks pre-covid. Patients wore cough, always enforced. British government never given shit welfare children Well 1st 2nd class citizens depending area votes. government locked 1st class citizens south west started show increased rates. also increased payout affected job loss 1st class citizens affected job losses. got it. Antimasker red cap Qtards convinced world conspiring Trump via Covid19 overreactions Spitting Image reboot worth watching? afford pay extra deliveries. Yeah I'd consider special needs online schooling way better since pace. finished task 10min go back sleep instead sitting school another 1h haha Wrong both.

Average years life lost sure looking at, there's sizeable spike summer. normally bet sheer bloody-minded stubbornness British public. Time flies you’re fun, one currently fun. landed gentry family wealthy make fortune finally getting Deal Brexit completed. People obstacles this. thread full people visit godlikeproductions. go urgent care earlier year nearly severed finger. first everyone wearing masks, two people strolled in, masks, receptionist say thing. Pissed off. know list pick but, think fairly safe say that, although tried, they've deemed unsuccessful. European countries looking alternative methods.

When look alternative methods, look countries successful. And, know it... successful went lockdowns. app! yoy could also scan surroundigs get warning picks covid cough! One five dumb bag hammers. Alexa play champions. Night night tory boy

Don't test positive die car crash choke corn flakes next 28 days, may part covid count! Europe paying price stopping lockdown allow summer tourism move forward. bulk economy beaches packed usual. people got sick like USA protesting well. talking relatives Italy hospitals full again. small store cuz shops at, says 5 people time, 20 one wears masks. That's problem much information. There's plenty information validate wearing mask. people wear different wavelength you. take moment day thank school staff! know much guys accommodate neverending changes cleaning protocols etc. appreciate you! :-) That’s right. forgot actually locked 100 cases, didn’t wait 700. weren’t days Wah? 18 today melb. far freezing. Melb gets properly cold ain't cold sure. Yeah isnt 40+ like uncomfortable I'm local bar social media groups agree. incentive threat enforcement hospitality owners leave restrictions entirely public self enforce. I'm blaming hospitality staff anyway obviously want make living still joke There's much do.

Only many ventilators made many beds.

Only many nurses doctors finish training 6 months, ones dealt first wave still dealing burnout mental health issues.

Sometimes time plan solve every problem family havin birthday party told everyone get sick make sure virus takes im healthy im ''beating tush''

i cancel gym membership duringa year progress weightloss might get sick anyway idiots need cake Engaged 8 months? sure he's nurse Marine? kidney failure. various embolisms. heart inflammation. strokes. number fatal phenomena directly caused COVID. 

People mind-blowingly, willfully stupid this. much snot, spit pee excrete pools &amp; lakes get swallowed others? mean, maybe pee isn’t defined “droplet”? sun strong enough give vitamin D, ozone hole fine. originator 116 cases, might well eating bats. Well makes plenty sense. hope God experiment worth it. about? We've full lockdowns already recently went back semi-normal. Complaining ok far become war police (for... reason... Idk Italians dumb... Everybody dumb except guess ahaha) Bojo's plan, I'm worried. know former employer (a solicitors firm) stayed open throughout Lockdown 1.

I managed leave better job first lockdown announced total coincidence glad.

I 100% know they'll stay open time too. Oh please, ridiculous hyperbole, calm down. Apparently delayed could go trick treating! Ridiculous comparison. news came light week someone insider knowledge reportedly leaked government’s daily reports covid-19 hospitalization NPR. updates document nationwide trends hospitalizations covid-19 patients, highlighting facilities reaching capacity stress lack beds, ventilators, equipment. According NPR, reports show hospital occupancy, ventilator usage, ICU bed occupancy steadily increasing month October, Oct. 27 report revealing three shot 14%-16% around metropolitan areas Atlanta, Minneapolis, Baltimore appear especially stretched thin, reporting 80% full capacity in-patient hospital beds. situation’s even worse cities like Tampa, Birmingham, New York: facilities struggling 95% ICU capacity could soon run intensive care beds. issue we're major store small community visited overwhelmingly people day in, day out, hour announced week beforehand _and_ prominently advertised wall. also started hour opening, give alcoholics nicotine addicts time get fill 'cause forgot pick shit last night, even early birds thought of.

Didn't matter. Still got abuse. Probably cabinet infighting back benchers board. Wednesday may interesting yet. article said New York 95% ICU capacity. right? Yeah, else call amount vitamins body body work with. Tory constituencies badly affected now. literally said speech increasing rates Southwest made concerned. Ever knew optimistic realistic time? participated looked analytically saw minimum risk spread. Logistically well organized, mostly outside, lots spacing people, mandated masks. link Same, really going petrol stations around country (yay work) less 50% chance someone mask anywhere experience. negligence intended. 140k active cases sounds scary heck. Consider fear mongered. Yeah, millions people cities highways, like UK millions people cities highways. Today's announcement included extension furlough scheme. sub promote political campaign? 1/2 aged 75 older. 

How many people would simply died last year Covid? flash, 1.2 million age group died causes

Now go provisional death count week. initial wave March/April one idea treat covid, total deaths went up. that, average deaths per week average range prior covid.

So please,  e r  hide, big bad covid coming you!! reason they'll send kids work sick parents usually enough sick days stay home take care kids.

For jobs, stay home take care kid, that's money lost.

All all, healthcare take care well everyone.

Additionally, catch Covid lengthy hospital stay, could absolutely bankrupt me. Even long-term effects.

There something said security healthcare. I'd much less afraid work felt like I'd taken care something happened.

Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* weird feeling Trump going win again, even though polls say differently. Well schools still open so... told NPR 800 state health officials access reports state, must granted permission another state view data. outlet notes arbitrary restrictions fat lot good places emergency services frequently cross state lines, like Tennessee, shares border eight states Interesting thought, unlikely lack single ingredient would deter people celebrating rather traditional holiday. Also TIL word 'manky'. Yeah, think back time little heard parents mention Gulf War, thought bunch golfers driving balls other...

I think it’s something like No, private university lab. always hated “corporate” tons rules glad. wear masks times work less 6 feet distance (even 10 minutes), also wear face shield. rounding corner. orange said Yeah it’s new, big pro-Brexit. testing. stopped testing #1. Yeah, saw kids trick treating today. Suprisenly crowded today. Rounding corner record numbers. Oh they're complaining. truth Boris Johnson lost lot credibility following first lockdown seemingly rushed get things back normal soon (and ways unnecessary) well Dominic cummings flouting rules seemingly allowed so. left lot people resentful.

I'm lockdown, even doubts much people follow it. People burnt man... Controlling spread minimize death therapy vaccine developed prevent overwhelming hospitals thus limiting even needless death. (Someone emergency needs ICU bed they're taken covid patients, guess dies?)

It's really simple shutdowns work that. There’s chance won’t go parliament though. thought ""rounding corner""? wonder were, say, trillions dollars spent national machismo, like military, could freed given people need time this? Seriously, work office. straight forward ability work home. told work home now. Work home sounds like management ask come in. milk. buy specific Vitamin milk. usually since I'm taking supplements anyways. It’s really lockdown compare places control Asia Oceania Exactly.

I've promoted twice work since Trump elected, I'm much better health, paid debts.

None Trump. ""Negligence"" implies mistake.

This mistake. deliberate effort conceal facts. US government Part One: UK outsourced tech support jobs us, I'm one Employees. fuck up, I'm looking job. 



Part Two: switched democracy 30 years ago, killing dictator. opened country capitalism competition, perhaps one proudest achievements robust, high performance cheap internet. pay 10 quids per month 1000mbps fiber optic link straight bedroom. literally switch modem laying bed. 


But unfortunately, communist leaders easily switched off, I'm afraid. live on, like cockroaches , infesting every branch called democratic government. Resulting corrupt government allowed disease spread much already. 


What's UK government's excuse? Without enforcement pointless.

After Dominic debacle initial lockdown one respected bjo instructions. ironic cause feel public support.

Now one pays attention them. Boris's dad caught without mask said forgot rule country (he'd come abroad)

The tories done u-turns water park.

There's real feeling govt utterly useless. Even people voted in.

It's got bad alot newly elected MP's North England banded together make stand govt financial help they've given (its good. - they're serving self-interest)

It's shame people pissed much bjo give toss Imagine world CDC actually collect statistics gun-related deaths, buried data public gather data calling hospitals, clinics, morgues data they’re legally required give anyone government. That’s we’re dealing COVID data.  One major cause states hour makes opening hours confusing, listed online.

So drove store find actually open another hour.

That said, personally never went anywhere first hour open case. expect lock whole country every flu season consistency sake, know cause that's shut country virus really affect old sick.

My obese unhealthy 20+ cigarette day cousin shrugged like nothing. obviously life outside this. home winter much stretch.

It friends stuff. I've seen, classes usually consist 20-30 students. Also, rotating classes really thing here. People sometimes send kids school sick, maybe much US. pandemic probably much less common though. Definitely sliding Texas Florida range recent years. Could anti mask sentiment propell Trump suprise victory Tuesday night? near-zero-risk fresh air street, wear them, everywhere indoors, did.

Got it.

And still stop Covid.

Perhaps sub could stop fucking obsessing masks couple weeks, hold breath. (Slightly above) minimum wage worker here. enforcing masks- get enough shit catching Corona idiot can't arsed put mask on. “According NPR, reports show hospital occupancy, ventilator usage, ICU bed occupancy steadily increasing month October, Oct. 27 report revealing three shot 14%-16% month.” think mistake ""profit"" ""survival"" comes hospitality sector year. real shame resort ad-hom attacks youthful watching certain pundits (full stop), thought acting like adult point. Remember, mature means considering facts, resorting fear-mongering brow-beating.

While indeed dealing viral pandemic (as disease exists every continent), lethality virus extraordinarily low considering death-per-infection rate majority demographics. such, since already know protect vulnerable via transmission vectors preventatives, literally need world governments overstep liberties ""protect"" us other. leave private businesses enforce ""no-mask-no-entry"" policies.

In terms Coronavirus, safety defined probability contracting virus, multiplied probability serious complications requiring hospitalization. first factor technically defined actions actions around (masks + social distancing), second factor determined entirely you. yet define coherent argument (aside ""your freedom, safety"" soundbite) governments must place fines, penalties, legal actions citizens would accomplish private businesses accomplish. everywhere doors though, gyms leisure centres require masks example. prosecution violating = lockdown. 103% good? Refrigeration trucks? sad part probably none young people die, rather older people family infect. Pure selfishness. OP, would try altering title article change meaning? think anyone would notice? [The country europe lowest daily death rate yesterday, 3rd lowest 7 day moving average death rate europe, country europe declining death rates, country lockdowns mask Nothing comment responsible.

/s stopped drinking milk years. strangely, whole Covid thing went down, started craving it. drink regularly. real lot better everywhere else. Australia, Caribbean, New Zealand, Japan, South Korea, Singapore lol goes back point. Want know effective yet unethical way prove theory? 1 confirmed positive mask see many get infected.

You can't say ""may had"" come certain conclusion. No, shoddy reporting (or shoddy detective work behalf cdc). 

The gov't mass testing almost two weeks learning least two people tesed positive (which days arrival). first round testing, half tests came back positive, end camp, serological positive result. 

People came 21 states internationally attend camp. 

**""At retreat, students counselors required wear masks social distance, students mixed freely.""** 

By July, virus already well control many states, irrational assume first kid develop symptoms case arrival. 

This third instance CDC claims single index case despite limited evidence case -- lord knows detriment alleged index case's mental health. North Dakota currently 5.65% *entire* population confirmed infected far, higher country per capita total infections (except 77k population microstate Andorra). talking about? 

This whole discussion long term measures, lockdowns. answer question? there’s effective vaccine treatment, continue follow PH measures social distancing mask mandates forever, live virus accept increased mortality lower life expectancy? Ahh I'm ""chef"" replies said get tips Im get English get minimum wage risk life cook frozen food drunks rent money no..... Memorial Day. Ok man, tell kid, fun hearing funeral trying explain grandpa hates brought plague home grandma killed her. 

That's kind choice really making, type soft individual first thing literally killing people right now, love wish good time, right stupid dangerous. people think black white way. stopping everything reducing transmission zero. trying change majority people's behaviour patterns reduce infection rate 1 ease pressure hospitals without paralysing economy households. Yeah even initial peak hospitals weren’t overwhelmed it. America fucked lol might well whole country bin. Hopefully people take seriously want see Halloween affect numbers

Remember me! 14 days
Remember me! 10 days Well, current rates break end november. Half million February reckon. Regardless president. deaths kinda wired now... give Bezos control world saving us that. need asshole. lockdown also cause deaths. care people die COVID; nobody gives shit someone dies something else. dickhead Downing Street, that's I'm afraid Still got paragraph hate outa you. ;p sucks, brother, makes angry. We're fucking laughingstock be, I'm humiliated embarassed. can't say enough, wrong people?? Ahsjdjdkkf scariest thing knowing America world superpower leaders trust scientists. Roughly population Pittsburgh, gone. Waving utah. 9/11 Anthrax letters. analyzed one found lab US, letters stopped follow-up reports. summer, it’s 115 outside, indoors pretty much option. it’s finally cooling ‘summer’ outdoor activities. understand growth right? understand infection rates increasing? understand there’s delay infection ending hospital? Yeah im going base anything standard America. literally pushing disinformation weakens health responses, shit like many Americans gonna dead tonight. reddit favor right? necessarily - Covid far contagious. 

Covid, mitigation measures, R number 3. spring. Flu, mitigation measures, 1.3 - season much conducive respiratory spread, winter. enough exponential growth 10-25% population get infected season (most people immunity many flu strains)

So takes relatively little bring flu rate cannot take much all. R number Covid brought 2 flu 0.9, steadily keep there, flu die relatively speaking whereas Covid increasing exponentially infects large enough proportion population.

 However frequently brought R number Covid 1, even 1.5 US. Anything 1 held period time allows rate exponential growth, flu, far less contagious simply able take measures hold Covid 1-1.5. Oh no! I’m sorry hear that. terrible combination. sincerely hope pull sooner later. Try stay calm don’t stress out, take one moment time. 💕 moral legal position, scientific one. even demonstrated pragmatic one. Making social species planet socialize benefit preventing wave deaths us unprincipled taking gambles wanton abandon.

No one knows consequences policies are.

Making human socialization illegal moral wrong given proportionality die vs millions lives unforeseen future consequences.

Humanity never socially engineered disease. bet this. can't blame both? Weak leadership through, Boris shown time time listen health science ministers always seems make worst decisions comes fighting pandemic. Stop passing blame blame fall two groups people simultaneously. Surely it’s demand side issue - lockdowns crush consumer spending, turn leads bankruptcies businesses used serve said customers. depends crowded. I'm walking around suburb block, wear mask social distancing easy. downtown business area something, wearing masks. shit absolutely spreads outside, well. Watch quickly anti-worker public turns hospitals like they've already turned doctors. That's need mass testing , quarantining, masks.
We that. Watch rugby, like. crazy much space room given non-sensical voices opinions US. 

That people actually rally around use push back sensible rational voices concept cannot understand someone brought East Asia.

The language use new cluster virus found terms like 'mobilized war' , 'immediate shutdowns quarantines' , 'once weekly flight restrictions' 'mass testing entire city' ... 

The language used right US 'what shall halloween christmas respect pandemic' People still drink milk? 🤔 world aren’t mandating working home possible? I’m NY wfh 100% time company doesn’t “believe” it. Haha, I'm Scottish assure I'm furthest thing tory. Label want tho, mate. ""Just honest"" - Tell whole story then. call propaganda leaving things like

""Very low infection fatality rates seem common Asian countries.8,11,29,48,49,51,59,61,67 younger population countries (excluding Japan), previous immunity exposure coronaviruses, genetic differences, hygiene etiquette, lower infectious load unknown factors may explain low rates. infection fatality rate low also low-income countries Asia Africa,44,49,66,67 perhaps reflecting young age-structure. However, comorbidities, poverty, frailty (e.g. malnutrition) congested urban living circumstances may adverse effect risk thus increase infection fatality rate.""

Yes old people, do? Dismantle health system 3rd world level let people die Corona kill them? euthanize people 60 weak immunity, diabetes etc.? maybe keep pretending we're immune reality hits us hard, lockdown, kill business anyway, quickly start pretending again? maybe repeat Asian countries successfully fought Covid? mean sampling bias - different regions different demographics. 

The economy isn’t hit people drop dead; it’s hit people worry start hoarding money. enough people die might become significant reduction emissions, certainly seems like America trying part. think still talking completely technical point view. course perspective right. I'm talking ""rights"" point view would discussed drinks party. US rights every legal sense word. “.. Fuller, 40, said understands elderly people underlying conditions vulnerable. population includes father, ALS contract virus despite unknowingly spending time family members it.

If dies, Fuller said, “in opinion … he’s going ALS,” COVID-19..”

Fortunately Fuller’s opinion obsolete topic. asthma get Covid-19 subsequently kills me, it’s asthma inevitably led death. words, father dies preemptively Covid family carelessly gave him, it’s ALS killed him. even put guy article? Congratulations “hardening up” events clearly terrible effect life could continue way many years. like many us school I’m sure you’re making many connections getting real work experience field rather sucking school material. 

I’d accept “hardening up” effects weren’t tangibly negative potentially long-lasting. I’m going tell kid could missing important social development harden up, I’m going tell women abusive household can’t get harden up, I’m going tell middle class unemployed parent who’s struggling keep food table harden up, I’m going tell undergrad needs academic contacts get grad school can’t get harden up. Mental health matters I’m tired seeing people act like doesn’t. 

You “hardening up” events negatively affected life way tells you’re rolling accepting gave control life want others same. That’s sad it’s sad see many college students mindset. dumb metric is?)

No Lmao Sucks England must lot cases. Luckily live America everything opening back virus totally disappearing like president says /s \*cries American\* love nickname! comment naive ignorant. happen people. Europe wave gonna hit US next? like correlation need everywhere seeing resurgence. blows fucking mind many places WORSE lockdown stimulus programs shit, people acting like past. need lockdowns support people unable work small businesses ever. fucking nuts. happens November 5th? filling break fall out, needed immediately replace it, many options. Plus, trust dentist assistant (that seeing years) hurt me. extremely traumatic experience child dentist, hard find one feel safe let work teeth. made upset mask wearing enforced. blame deal-breaker though. hear you. I’m trying puzzle it’s hard people, reckon they’re worn w COVID masking, ignorant purpose/ appropriate use masks, COVID deniers sociopaths. Maybe COVID already think they’re hook? necessarily. Depending symptoms. high temperature indicate great variety different ailments require emergency treatment. 

For example fever Stomach ache months ago wanted tough home corona. Turns appendicitis really good thing went hospital Thanks. I'm really tired people saying people stay home they're worried catching it. Even social anxiety &amp; mental illnesses, mean alone 100% time affect us. I've many people say must easy me. not. need least see people, twice month, even interact people. anyone original predictions deaths trump forced Fauci go take back. believe published March/April predicted 160K deaths august. pay delivery. No, we're not. You’re right lot points, sadly large portion country can’t see long term benefits they’ll continue paying price. likely. disagree. seasonal affected depression. summer could sit work outside, sun even couldn’t go anywhere else. winter lockdown means literally inside constantly nowhere go all. never waste good crisis Reinfection extremely rare currently, let's relax bad takes. normal Winter three major holidays, lot office parties / gathering restaurants bars, many people travel warmer destinations getaways. 
Also Winter want see anyone, “let’s meet park stay away options” involve lot coats. meshes well antivaxxers least. still kind condescending. ""Hope goes well future,"" going well working retail? didn’t know, thanks.  excuse poor behavior towards minorities. hah thanks! wonder short sided would lol Stage 3 100, stage 4 400-600 Exactly world isn’t welcomed would think would small percentage mail ballots. early votes absentees ahead even day person votes right? it’s blowout election I’d think we’ll still see called Biden Tuesday. never said need. primal instinct. It’s basic way humans act. Look primal instinct. It’s hard wired humans. sure, selfishness, too. It’s two sides coin. Humans need find companionship. go war survive. don’t know don’t know primal instinct is. look up. It’s great don’t need go meet people. everybody can. women’s biological clock ticking. They’re running time child. Say want, real thing. It’s good mental state in. farken proud. United States Australia, majority Straylians came together. Unlike Divided States America. two kids. It’s responsibility provide care anyone else’s. That’s problem today, people kids expect schools ones raising someone else solve problems them.

Yes, society require things like jobs rent payments. 😐 This. again, paid spread disinformation, would behave exact way them. Vietnam first world country. beat Europe America. American say is, least attempt nation leader! Yes, damn Mexicans Canadians causing USA hit 100k cases/day Half country refusing wear one pandemic. Chances afterwards zero Also sleep apnea, take B1. Sleep apnea drastically increases risk covid complications death. Habitual use antacids deplete B1, quit sugar anything else triggers acid reflux.

Save lives vs pander anti-maskers 

Tough choice know they’re occurring? think meant hospitals, makes sense. Going get downvoted but, strange comparison.

Nurses primary victims war, whereas healthcare workers primary victims COVID. Also, COVID countries (afaik), whereas WWI really. Finally, world population large WWI, effect tragedies like war disease large. Exactly, never exceptions. genuinely can't wear mask due health condition past trauma every sympathy. still can't go shops. means offer support people, home deliverys click collect etc.

Why make law? specific America fucked. many mouth breathing anti mask/antivax dont infringe civil liberties fucktards think may late stem tide. Seriously, general mood corona over. stupid strong Nothing mom Lol stealing this. everybody “get therapist”, dude. Especially loads people don’t job. They’re expensive lot cases can’t even see person. *reality = billion dollar companies like amazon exploit system despite making hundreds millions profit amidst covid whilst Jim boy still close restaurant/it repair shop/flowering business/etc.* never heard deadly disease eventually became less deadly everybody either died got antibodies. ever happened? 

The common coronaviruses probably started way; one theorised caused Russian flu pandemic killed million people 1890. days, pretty much everyone exposed young age, knows deadly would someone first got exposed 90 year old?

And might exactly talking about, viruses killed large numbers Native Americans likely serious everyone else first came around.

Measles, example, common childhood disease vaccines made getting generally seen rite passage; killed people compromised immune systems (that mean worth vaccinating, contagious people compromised immune systems definitely get endemic).

But understand it, absolutely devastating Europeans first brought new world population never experienced before. might caused devastating plague among Europeans ancient times, adapted it. Fair enough convenience/budget bottom line not, personally would rather pay bit local and/ non bezos related business small companies thier employees might thrive. That's cases Australia's total (27,593), almost many deaths (907). researchers found 82 per cent hospitalized COVID-19 patients (who taking supplements) vitamin deficient, **47 per cent control group deficiency.**

Vitamin deficiency common general population appears, least group Spain. biggest advantage think people likely adopt better hygiene habit, frequent handwashing. Staying home sick likely encouraged frowned upon going forward. Perhaps people get sick also use masks.

Working home another huge positive economic shift see result COVID-19. makes sense commute hour back work to. likely true, let's forget potential impact weather, end summer, people getting even fed restrictions, etc. scientific studies showing actual quantified impact school reopening? theyre fun. gotta stay vigilant year 🤧 fucking kidding Every man (woman / child) themself.

The protests saw massive groups - thousands upon thousands people - protesting city squares little social distancing, kids can’t go trick treating parents friend group, even masks, risk high?

Seems like moving goalposts me. know this. sterilizing end pandemic. Yes, need China style lockdown, closed boarders quarantine facilities testing essential arrivals, Taiwan style isolating system infected contacts taken quarantine hotel given tracker 2 weeks. baffles solution staring government face yet 'don't want risk economy' take away peoples freedoms, however, eradicated Covid would far better economically would life freedoms almost back normal apart travelling abroad. I’m sure Burgum science denier. pleasing public wear masks. won’t mandate it. press conference holding back tears earlier year asking people nice others wear mask. disagree “no mandate” policy, hasn’t openly spoken science. Kristi Noem SD much worse.  basically, admission they'll tests assess blood counts basic liver/kidney tests drug dosing, anything else contingent specific problem. vitamin would mainly context bone kidney disease generally, hospital must link Covid early. Target, walmart, etc free delivery like $35 minimum. mean literally, I'm American. vote 'that' 2016.  think get tested constantly. 

And age, get tested often manage early gets hand. 'faith based' camp. says all. words ignorance $. I've read (aka D2, aka ergocalciferol) plant based used hypoparathyroidism among things. D3 (aka cholecalciferol) animal based used rickets. Although looks like overlap used treat things. plant based animal based almost sound like thing, I'm reading they're not. think need ""explain like I'm 5"" post. thought meant boom people going digging crystals, buying them. offence tourism pandemic fucking stupid  Usa 3.1 million active cases, new yesterday. Spain reporting active cases, running total 1.2 million total cases, 25k new cases. Belgium 375k active cases, 23k new.

That's great. I'm running numbers phone adjust population, imagine glancing numbers new cases per capita usa right now, whereas much greater total case load. two different metrics, different implications. Yeah much closer meant comment above. vigilant aware (as really be), paralyzed fear way. Kinda sucks can't tell someone attractive though. Chicks throw smokey eyes they're like hot way. Initially, way back start, federal government made clear going suppression elimination. first national lockdown really slow things get set contact tracing extra resources (testing, equipment.) definitely meant flattening curve.

The government said wanted 80% compliance, Australian people delivered 90% compliance. Frankly, think motivated saw happening overseas think public sentiment flavoured elimination. think geographic cultural factors fall favour too. June states eliminated virus, changes landscape moving forward.

The Victoria outbreak (July) special case elimination close explicit goal.  Yeah, second this. 100 staff medical practice, test every two weeks self swab. Constantly dealing tests come back late, option shut locations 14 days sort out. Last week time test came back positive one staff member, really 10 infected. testing situation still mess.  That's entirely true. dumb trump said cases due testing making somewhat valid point. plenty countries without capacity accurately test reflect bad going. India example 8 million cases heavily skewed towards rich unlike countries better systems place skews towards poor. already ankylosing spondylitis, top would really suck. seem simply ignore third world exists.

So rich nation can't implement plan works nations can't afford fact poverty prevalent US too

And yet nearly 87% US households internet access would assume percent households school age kids internet access higher yet. would say kids could learn home. can't still allowed participate vastly thinned school classes provided free internet access government. That's hard, stranger. Make sure exercise routine things need look yourself. blue light?  stupid comment ever seen reddit doubt tbh hotel quarantine NSW Victoria so, wouldn’t unusual. Various auto immune reactions listed potential side effects every vaccine. reminds condition PANDAS Miles miles many cases. Yeah, used think occasional Asian saw wearing mask little kooky. hope mask wearing folks feeling weather becomes thing US. Better get Murdoch start calling Boris dictator guess abolish name commons derogatory toward common people  Like taiwan New Zealand Australia took threat seriously eliminated virus Australia opened border NZ it’s really island reason covid eliminated keep using excuse ignore shit NA EU done First said virus hoax actually deadly.

Then said ploy get microchips everyone.

Now say deadly enough global depopulation plan.

Can conspiracy theorists consistent? assuming lot here. winter lockdown kids. 2 week hard lockdowns enough eradicate things get anywhere close? mean doesn’t even follow potential virus progression... 2 weeks now, people starting effects exposure morning. Working NSW remarkable achievement done, particular sacrifices victorians made country.

What helped WA QLD refusing help burdening NSW SA keeping country running sake political point scoring Here's easy rule thumb remember. 

If earns money large company; carry on.

If earn money large company; essential.  head maybe wasn’t even comparing US per capita like people (where population density differs factor 30x). peer European countries meaningful frame reference, also similar population density. matter discretion. going something important, course people different ideas what's important not. math. Let's say 0.1% population one million infected. 1000 cases. 90% accuracy means 10% false positive 10% false negative, result would 100,800 positive count. Also 10 cases undetected. took tyranny true~ /r/thatsthejoke Okay Boomer^unironically&amp;&amp;in_ageeement really think aware something averse thing afraid it. Like every second driving car aware danger accident, mean like sweating nightmares it. hope least it’ll put end notion it’s “heroic” come office even you’re sick. Oh get wrong, late full lockdown. happened weeks ago. Agree risks getting close holiday season, also desire spoil summer holiday season partly responsible current state affairs. draw comparison US. Germany's done much much better, could curbed second wave broken earlier germany break already fairly big.

When exactly ""broken"" also live back basically normal summer germany. Sure ha wear mask supermarket aside nothing really happening. localized outbreaks generally virus happening.

So virus ""happening"" summer. go ""not happening"" summer suddenly ""happening"" now? It’s kind funny, first upvoted people appreciated gallows humor, couple replies changed interpreted started downvoted. made much difference place. Chinese letting anyone Wuhan early stages. knew bad enough shut country domestically January didnt shut internationally 2 months later don’t think protest concept that. Wow, social anxiety casino job rough. used work job requires host meetings participate them. got drinking daily. Idk work casino everyday. keep saying limbo feeling terrible feels like year forever. American here. love calling people bellends. Victoria isn’t small area it’s large area infected massive numbers Chief scientist disagrees bud Well doesn’t work segment population doesn’t isolate... requires unanimous collaboration entire population work. 

It takes enforcement. People anything incovinces unless they'll get trouble don't. fine people take handicapped parking spaces. like think live around bunch assholes park closer, do. We'd need enforcement federal level handle police refuse jobs, done. Yes. That’s exactly need do. stay heck home ever fucking fuck?! ... &amp; Melbourne &amp; countries listed, virus GONE AWAY enforced measures.

Sounds like need get tested mate... Wow that. never thought antisocial trait ever turn positive thing. Haha. masks enough groups thousands people social distancing without causing massive outbreaks, they're enough small groups people going trick-or-treating.

But worth risk? going least possible. protests least protecting human life; risk infection night town? week prediction well 😏 That's yesterday. Today went 0 (4 hotel quarantine) elected, said “how bad could be?” assumed checks balances would prevent anything major. yea, are. That's nice, dear. Thanks regional Victoria hard worth Yes denialists simply cannot accept exceptionalism could possibly root problems.

It must geography, genetics, temperature, or........... Right? Like obviously better plans random, uncoordinated stuff hoping magically improves thing “2 weeks it’s better” line disproven many times over. suggested military enforcement quarantine back Feb/March sub, couple ppl agreed. still fix this. Definitely enforced quarantine proper leadership. GOP states never let through. Oh right that's bad outside yesterdays reporting period added onto todays tally. think first full day days ago VIC donut day NSW carrying case, could wrong though Loneliness massive health risk. many studies prove this, chronic loneliness bad smoking. Socialization essential humans  Exactly. whole summer people cases didn’t rise. Soon schools go back, cases rise. Hmm coincidence. still flights Vietnam countries lowered travel restriction travellers Vietnam. Japan one countries.

Also, Vietnam still allows returning Vietnamese citizens, foreign experts, investors, people official diplomatic missions enter country. waiting list long still need have: negative test certification allowed on-board, wear full PPE board, get tested least twice arrival, stay hotel government quarantine 14 days, install contact tracing app phone duration stay, submit government travel history planned travel schedule country, health monitored local medical professionals visiting house daily 28 days, limit contacts house/hotel room workplace 28 days, inform planned contacts install contact tracing app phones 28 days. guess lockdowns work better change seasons said actually appreciated chief staff Mark Meadows saying last weekend CNN administration going control pandemic. “I tip hat admitting strategy,” said. “He straightforward telling what’s mind. commend that.”

Bout time started really distancing what's going WH now. Nope. haven’t gotten flu god knows long (I get vaccine), I’d rather get flu week living constant fear people. every person breathes, can’t really avoid that. can't tell joke not. ... &amp; Melbourne &amp; countries listed, virus GONE AWAY sausage many companies could everything protect workers since beginning pandemic really let down. solidified fact sense loyal employee considered expendable. dont go trick treating mask practicing reasonable distancing neighbors? guys hysterical Nope hotel quarantine local transmission today 🍩 Yeah turns sorta similar US, especially Northeast tiny states could work one state live another. Especially essential workers get priced city centers commute via rail 2 hours. Curious uk celebrate since don’t Australia. Stop per capita bullshit... beat 7 days. Woo! 

Damn. get sick, usually recover fully within 3-4 days. 68 new cases yesterday - 3 new deaths.

Hawaii still community spread shitty contact tracing - like rest america. easing travel restrictions like fall apart soon.

If want talk islands let us discuss UK ireland...... get many people fired possible furlough bill cheaper time? better, sure, probably won't. Yes! Really fun things neighborhood too. Candy chutes, candy skateboards, remote control car delivery systems.

Already caught one 😂 seem forget 700 cases day Victoria one point April top 20 globally case numbers undiagnosed aspergers? I'm wondering walk outside while. video game addiction suddenly good thing hospitals nations overwhelmed, medical personnel left cater new cases, death rate skyrocket, combined exponential growth not, really unlikely. can’t believe schools still open Belgium given spiraling-out-of-control situation google triage. 
It happening earlier covid. People getting turned away dying beds. change minds.

Yeah facts, carrying world increasingly works less less. Good place pandemic got information sources linked showed 0 experience epidemiology lol.  goaaaaal People stopped drinking milk? someone giving up, over, while. collectively shit pants hard amount detergent get stains out. even then, retail worker last month there’s nothing could someone came store without mask (maybe 15% time). apparently it’s police enforce government policies clearly never around Even medieval people would cringe crystal healers call witches burn alive. Government making emergency policies combat terrorism overreach good government. Government making emergency policies combat increased drug use overreach good government. Honestly fuck fuck anyone would trade freedom safety even worse make believe safety. what's 5.4% senior population US currently? poor plan. forced lock frequently shorter bursts. I'd rather one severe lockdown incredibly low numbers goal never another lockfown.

If month reopen, long need lockdown live there, police quite incompetent abuse population specially poor look native (they executed native men month ago), also wont follow rules. fine people crooked governor say something.

Milan's almost 1% population test positive second wave already, 2/3 much mortality NYC first wave? Wales Scotland? lot people Victoria fighting lockdown, including media.

Sure Jacinda popular, need realistic here. guns, trucks flags Bible. Utah full Mormons? RDA dose recommended way low, 5000 fine pretty much everyone things help absorption vitamin D. live America, really think inaccurate image.

We're country people used sacrificing greater good, that's problem. cultural problem, individual problem.

Sure, small percentage us actively rallying masks. much larger percentage --- I'd venture say majority --- quietly wearing them, wearing sometimes, wearing except hang different groups friends every week. We're trying stop laws, we're ignoring them, wearing mask time haaaaaaard liiiiiiiiike hard thiiiiiiiings waaaaaaaaah.

The anti-maskers small percentage us, that's they're saying quiet part loud loud part quiet. TON Americans think way anti-maskers do, even would never admit it. Thank taking time conversation, things heated right im dick best time sorry, long post im tired please try stick here, think mixing terms fundamentally dangerous good civics.

Fundamental argument idea things determined social perspective, still, formal one expressed process nation. 

While fundamentally social issue, human rights, expressed legal form. common law countries (broadly referring commonwealth US that's areas studied) essentially tried put shield around social area (and many others) ensure issues determined people (socially talking about), important, court supposedly society (this could argue fun think :P) decided way get voting. get limited number predetermined ways police reps.

Ready deep dive Australian electoral politics? 

If live system country expresses social desire bills amendments. Frankly, Australian's wanted things considered rights, that's choice determined ballot box. good evidence show latest election large majority state supports hard lockdowns, shut borders travel, indicated resoundingly re-electing state premier. 

Now let's imagine moment people could decide rights nation based purely social perception, infected area like Victoria able declare citizens right travel Queensland low cases? significant business social pressure towards reopening tourism industry southern states government elected ignore therefore avoided part southern second waves. 
 
You actually used good example china rights misunderstood government/lawyer/institution would deal authority issue. talking is, essence, ""policy issue"" (from national common law jurisdiction viewpoint anyway), rights (e.g representative leaders country Australia im right assuming American) allow us vote leaders go determine rights privileges law, ballot box point social perceptions towards right, become law extraordinary cases become constitutional amendments. 

So example, Australians Americans determined people certain rights guaranteed (right fair trial etc.) infringed upon matter supposed force law held support exercise e.g prime minister said ok Queens asked etc. etc. (im assuming rather skip deep dive exactly courts determined boundary). 

In addition this, identified, though law (which remember social expression democracy, though imperfect one) people additional privileges grants law may changed, modified, removed parliament (therefore people) decide needed. way, Parliament fulfils role check power court determining law restricts court appropriate realm particular act situation illegal law stands. 

So back China, would consider many things china violations human rights (such lack right free trial freedom religion) things morally repugnant illegal (Patient theft, overly harsh restriction movement without legal justification), lesser breach social contract. intellectually honest think difficult compare common law countries non CL ones im going further. 

The key thing right afford (socially legally) much higher standard protection mere law, may changed parliament whim. 

This particularly always crucial understand live federal system, state governments strong federal system massive resources disposal ensure people regarding right followed, simply authority resources turn protection privilege granted law.

Australian's (or least Queenslanders shall see rest country next fed election) decided freedom movement conclusively right one. grant right would unfairly infringe upon actual right powers state government (on behalf citizens) ""make laws subject relevance that
particular State"" correcting you. Sorry upset lol means WINNING! pretty fucking annoying people London places ignoring restrictions. area virtually everyone wears masks shops, visor, many wear outside too. Seems bigger cities flaunting rules. world needs this. defending handling Covid way, case anyone wondering, Texas 2 times bigger U.K. Yeah 9k scam, especially unis said they’d 50/50 person online online... sorry situation. don’t blame students continuing academic life govt guidelines either, months properly control spread school life started again. whole certain cities states will. let's hope vaccines safe highly effective. highly effective, mean 80s range. Thank NZ: 15 people per square kilometre

Sure Jacinda popular, need realistic here. remember going school, we'd get detention even five minutes late. punishment Boris get? Man authoritarian power fantasies real. y’all upset you’ll never able control 330 mil  I’m reading multiple books right now, finished writing one own, watched 50 movies, lost 20 pounds. stay home. I’m also crying restrictions. understand people whine like this. spent 20 years avoiding people people go nuts months. hiking camping bullshit? still stuff friend two completely avoid people. 

3 years progress life give break. spent 10 years panic attacks. guess people already certain mental health issues coping better people ""normal"". better be. Incompetence lack morals. people less likely follow prohibitive rules perceived sense unfairness? really affecting whole country, though - south west East england still lockdowned really problem except student outbreaks Exeter Plymouth. Exeter one well contained, Plymouth one looks reached care home somehow. wish news suggesting vitamin along C Zinc whole time instead throwing inflated death numbers people's faces 8 months. 100% A-OK people think this. likely fighting everything possible catch spread virus. know, right? Tell rationing war years harder social distancing wearing masks months. Tell waiting agony know whether son brother father going come back war YEARS harder staying home rather eating out. 

This fucking bullshit. mentioned many others:

Because parents still expected work.

The parents can't take care children working hours.
So taken care someone else.


The childcare system(s) (daycare, kindergarden, school,..) europe really good affordable.

Our whole system ""two person income"" depends it.


""Children vectors pandemic"" , ""children need in-person learning"" , ""schools safe"" , ... , ..

Those excuses one true reason:
There simply feasable alternative, allows parents keep working. Northern suburb cluster, Casey Chadstone crushed. They're well.

Go away ya gronk.  Shit, man. parents Iowa I'm scared them. People decided they're tired it, they're going go back regular life. kind control there? could call popo them. Masks little still sitting indoors close people extended periods time. Masks out, short duration, contact. Unless bigger amount COVID inside body Seems pretty chill NZ Good. may digestive issue affecting absorption. Vitamin sprays available absorbed blood via lining mouth. ""innovanation"" 🙃 Low key sounds like Fueller wants dad dead. elect party, individual Sweden increased SEK200 SEK400 around time. (AU$32 AU$64-ish). I'm amazed high amount pin transactions allowed do! Wow. like living completely different timeline rest us. hope attempt humour missed mark. Still excuse inappropriately touching kids think we're around every 15 seconds point. like demonstrate exactly US President Impeached deserves bashed. Easier buy vitamin D3. 2,000 5,000 IU/day see GP. lost luggage kissed connecting flight got covid. got going me. /s factual information topic routinely blocked Swedish lobby. unable respond. recoveries at? magically keeping track number longer important? really still think hospitals brink reaching full capacity? anywhere close beginning pandemic now, would different people wear masks forms night life restrictions? fucks sake, less 1% CFR &lt; 50 year olds, absolutely insane go full lockdown that. entire countries go full lockdown height many much deadlier diseases past? No. friend still taste smell 3 months Technically coronavirus happened flu deaths avoidable well? come never made major headlines? Whats scare media? term British catch term anyone four nations, including Northern Ireland. USA seriously needs something like independent election committee. Thier current system seems like sort thing would expect corrupt 3rd world country. Give six months. stands up, even skeptical. now, surprised see another article scientific evidence showing first wrong. interpretation comment involved ppl traveling abroad living Australia fyi People ""take seriously"" small parties surely one infected visits. hide someone dying plane? Go live America then, 51st state bloke Ok cool. Hook em. think even US see 4,000 deaths day, maybe that's hard maybe. really not. anywhere near Victoria did.

Can't half ass expect results. sharif like Yeah can't speak social security medicaid besides underfunded way long. may need increase tax alternatively we're screwed get prepared laughably small payments case anyone wondering happened, people top wanted less cases protect airline industry. 

If contact traced properly, word would get someone died plane July covid infected bunch people. 

Such story wuld've tanked reopen push. way I've looked epidemic hit pandemic level peak first wave China sheer spread led trickling countries. February, peak flu season. skyrocketing northern climates dipped flu/winter season concluded, substantially reached regions like midwest. 

Basically, first wave right end flu season. seen US February peak. think relation people cold flu, like Asia. never thought cold, will. read article, assumption. OK criticise literal children wanting happy childhood somehow OK tens thousands angry yelling adults marching streets shoulder shoulder. comment mine reference, allude (and specifically name one, economic constraints hardware) circumstances make situation disproportionately negatively affect children poverty.

It's bad ""discussion norm"" gloss actually discussed use single data point, devoid relevant context, make judgement call topic understand place know. surprised many adults turn man-children life majorly disrupted extended period time.

My mom great example: Brushes aside proclaims *""I gotta go!""* yearly vacation. Never mind outcome catches disease probably fifty-fifty death lifetime impairment. living Maui, Hawaii pandemic began. many friends SF flew islands first days airlines selling ridiculously cheap tickets counteract initial loss travel interest. agree absolutely. say that. immune response COVID-19 often faulty, auto-antibody production type 1 interferons (an anti-viral protein), cytokine storms oversecretion useless It’s Haiku, it’s Fucku That's barely enforced well. Saw people SWR tube either mask chin wearing one. tipping culture reminds big companies like coke blame consumer amount plastic bottles littered around globe, yet produce millions bottles. shouldn’t people pick slack company, fuckin pay people more. king understatement Funnily enough periodontist what's got freaked first place. Need dentist give new tooth going process pulling periodontist. staff either maskless/mask nose main doctor recent checkup :( Considered reporting sure good would even do, probably even repercussions. Here's hoping dentist office better Yep, lockdown schools open ain't lockdown. France, Germany, England. Another European economy bites dust.  go Barnard Star, make sure several points packets peanuts first. forget towel. Yeah.... Oh, projection. undiagnosed, would know? They're advised avoid confrontation moment. Challenging ""anti-maskers"" put risk. We've learned exactly nothing, sadly rabid Tory voters seem learn anything despite non stop shower shit we've lived decisions past years. 

Boris still incompetent unable string coherent, empathic sentence together despite educational background 

No, offering people financial incentives sit restaurants unmasked airborne respiratory pandemic good idea I'm south coast confirm. Although noses uncovered pulled way stating 'wearing mask' I’m accusing this, anyone uses Cummins affair excuse act responsibility fucking idiot. He’s calling nationwide lockdown basically can’t see friends anything joy it. course go work crowded office despite office work easiest home kids, vulnerable ones key worker parents, still school. Schools MAJOR infection hotspots yeah ok, it’s “lockdown” 

This worst government country ever had. They’ve spent ten years transferring public money private hands telling us “we’ve got money” justify national scale manslaughter spent year demonstrating little give fuck whether live die still people sit bleating like “ooooh don’t nasty, they’re best”

It’s pathetic. exceedingly agree less 1% chance even getting severe side effects even vaccine gonna get one day anyways still half pay hospital bill overpriced shot. 

Go see folks. also open borders similar countries like NZ Vietnam shocking number. Digging article seems major chunk children can't speak English. I'm sure English second language feel cracks online, clearly big part issue. True homelessness, lack access technology likely smaller portion.

Still, last sentence qoute agreeing with. Claiming ""permanent setbacks"" find excessive. Humans especially children incredibly adaptive. People want shine spotlight every potential negative crisis. Many kids spending time family members ever before. find great lasting benefit development well being? 


""Circumstances might push student school today different, even currently missing students return school soon allowed so, months missed opportunities learning could mean permanent setbacks,"" wrote. Yeah, today places mostly empty, doubt even 1 million tested. Still nice though don’t want blamed, admit using disposable cloth masks shown studies effective. 

And ridicule everyone else up-to-date epidemiological education. 

Where education basics masks? need NIOSH rated 95, 99, 100 block virus. 

Micron size matters. mask simply work. That’s basic information well-known since March. 

It’s really important don’t run around Internet telling people everything right still got it. That’s dangerous wrong information. I’m sorry guys got it, I’m ridiculing getting it, critical you’re leaving gaping holes information masks, acting like don’t know got it, it’s fault. want seen following examples Scotland, Wales, NI. Even though that's happens. Every time. bring sanitizer me... pin pad. 99.7% survival rate

*if healthy old*. 

Not mention, generally wanting get sick even non-lethal way solid excuse. people, sure. others, really code word Jews. I've seen many times. Sometimes they'll put (((parentheses))) around somebody's name indicate they're Jewish. call ""The Echo"", visual representation ominous echo indicate consider Jewish people brother already decided visiting family thanksgiving spending alone, live best states terms infections. really big deal, call parents. corner dear leader keeps saying turning like corner horror movie there's scary shit around bend? agree government could handled lot better, end day it’s responsibility act accordingly. It’s rocket science, plenty data realise going away unless stop spreading. It’s people’s fault ultimately, government. offering bible Another half assed measure, kids still go school...workers still go work impossible work home. Basically shutting non essential shops inform school give child X registers. X code government approved absence related COVID, receive fine. 

At school work can't social distance got: extra handwashing stations, sanitiser one every room, year class bubbles, staggered break lunches, online work absent. We've positive case yet; mostly we've strict measures encouraged kids work online show symptoms self-isolating. worse first time, yet lockdown less restrictive. Fucking madness.  99.7% survival rate. ... death people worried about. crippling effects bankrupting hospital bills too. real healthcare US, remember? type wear? Fabric/surgical ones offer worst protection uncomfortable. n95 n99 pretty decent soft edges made kind foam. Sure, comfortable whole day, cold want go shopping - not? definitely dicey. 

I'm mindset wanting another person chain via service like instacart still go myself. keep distance people keep moving also wear n95(I this) another layer top. Plus sanitize everything isolate anything buy immediately use several days. I'm going use it, I'll usually wipe 70% isopropyl alcohol. like Alabama  disagree. history indication, thing bring American people together unite common enemy. covid19 caused outside force, Americans would unite like 9/11. know Trump tries push narrative China's fault, however know (not entirely)

However, one knew biggest threat America would America itself.   N95 masks take 30-50% straight 95%. It’s important don’t leave information response. get paid money. days ago school, smoke break (so masks), guy felt intense need queeze two others guys together lift together. *was* funny, moment questioned everything  wrote strong, weak. Broken easy entropic universe.

Look W shapes flu IFRs simple example strong apply.
Women also thought stronger immune systems. Covid19, die less. Could hygienic behavior leading lower doses, could ability fight better. side, get long Covid often. Pretty much. I’m sorry that’s true. hospitals filling even though lockdowns implemented it’s left late sadly possibly going see replay happened Spring badly hit countries Europe actually happening majority here.  Come everyone. Pull together make work. Wow comforting me, im bang target. Except dont home yet. Thats scary part.  spread misinformation, please. Unfortunately Texas days go see people without masks. like gave up, got fed trying save lives. 

I never understand US turned country 50% population got brainwashed soo quickly. 

China deal bullshit fucking 3rd world country. 

Let's keep opposite recovered countries done see takes us. Let's keep defying science make bunch bullshit fallacies see solves anything.

If keep listening retarded infants WH get nowhere. Let's use common sense quit bullshit political drama ignore problem higher death toll rises. No, delayed Q&amp;A section shown BBC 1, news channels people see know exactly got it. guys wearing N95 masks. 

It’s mystery. 

The mystery anyone actually thinks loose-fitting mask completely unfiltered airflow coming around edges, going protect coronavirus. 

Studies shown masks reduce exposure 30 50% best. It’s better nothing. you’re wearing N95, exposed someone, you’re going get COVID even loose fitting cloth mask on. surgical mask. 

They simply don’t protect. wish narrative evolved past cloth masks never did. right birthday hahahaha love life 🙃 Dominic Cummins Dominic Cummins Dominic Cummins. I’m bored hearing it. It’s irrelevant point. lol sums like that. young man still pulls heart. terrible, terrible story. 42-year-old guy. arrived, pretty good shape, intubate him, anesthesiologist. held hands, said, ‘Cristina, swear wake up, two small children.’ help go sleep calmly, promised him. promise could keep, four five days, patient died. mess. still carrying this.

This scares shit I'm bit older two small kids, fuck

Meanwhile, everyone around seem care. wanted keep kids safe home numbers rising, problem immediately, I'm group risk apparently Yes. pandemic. pandemic reasonable approach saves lives. Dunno. Never seen faces. give 3 days, they'll say working like that. way expected one day. Granted wont rise much Sunday since testing sites pretty much empty right would good add another 500k. Europe made mistake allowing international vacations summer driven virus. paying price include U.K. this. [Inventor PCR analysis Nobel Prize winner Kary Mullis results Man 99.7% survival rate, go spend time folks. Well recommendation, people knew would go walk early morning  lock downs on/off thing ? 
After lock lockdown sounds like rational response No, logistical curve constant curve, likelihood asymptote. There’s always going people can’t catch one reason another rate infection simplistic exponential curve there’s high likelihood early fast burn either front line workers can’t avoid risk takers don’t care super spreaders, people (in majority) won’t get chance catch ergo spread once. Woken wrong side bed? 

There’s report EOTHO caused raise cases 8-17% cases. Covid secure. See soon!!! :D That's 50% whole nation. initial message wrong - put pressure fact mask protect claim protect OTHERS. People assholes, care others. really noticed masks helped quite bit allergies. really hope people adopt strategy. live Greece entered second lockdown It’s going hard winter people still continue ignore advice.
Personally don’t FB IG anymore got sick tired watching people feed party summer never mind Halloween. Let's throw facts discussion. causes problems people strong opinions. Bet December first day (assuming numbers stay low). Nobody wants premier keeping families apart christmas. Friend mine US gun pulled asking customer wear mask. earth indoor driving site? poor fucking healthcare workers Marshall's work indoors breathing fumes damn day. Surely Theres better way it? Check percentage wearing mask india compared countries india top 5 somewhere hit 1 million deaths people shift goalposts say 5 million deaths avoided. Maybe subtract Covid deaths entire population US - say great leader saved hundreds millions lives, cut chase? Sweden basket case, better try use neighbors excuse. confirms everybody already thinks. would take thread thank cashier lady works German DM cleaning pin pad punched pin.  


I made sure thanked this.  
No wonder Germany well. probably agree things, call statement. everybody wearing proper 95 mask, could virtually re-open entire economy including schools work, without spread virus. They’re multiple countries.

Solitary confinement social distancing holy Grail. context real life. Masks are. Masks work. everybody wore one, would pandemic. Even completely open economy. Kids need education. also one antibodies/autoantibodies sounds pretty First PM cared much economy, cares much education, one things done remotely. Would make sense celebrate vaccine comes out. Pretty pointless celebrate kind stat without one. Suicides aren’t reported statistics - “know” otherwise isn’t relevant. economic issues temporary, it’s going far worse countries without lockdown Yeah, pandemic, I’m sick. Otherwise, thanks little risk children deserve stability education. close state borders? gates police highways state lines are? Restricting travel states seems difficult many roads cross state lines. many places check. maybe roadways Australia less convoluted here. I’d rather bed week flu around two decades without worry Wales NI currently lockdown already. said flu SEASON. know, common peaks. wonder US state Er, relax? say something seemed anything other? This. possible stop U.S pandemic? hell alot work, yes. government people willing put effort? No.  lockdown, literally innoᴧation actually retarded Yes yes sunshine? live Victoria lol. 5 weeks ago. man can't even read first line accurately, dismisses real information, mocks misread something, rolling eyes failures? Thats laugh. Germany. People go little crazy L C K W N - ""don't go restaurant. go gym. go bar. meet 10 people 2 different households."" last one bit uncomfortable, sadly necessary. Basically everything else basically open. drop kids school, go buy groceries, shop clothes go hairdresser want to. Calling Lockdown stupid effect people panic buying toilet paper flour everyone scared next four weeks Lockdown effect psyche.

I wanna know happens real, hard Lockdown needs done can't get numbers control. think irrelevant, people's dismissal rules opinion traced back galavanting across England. forget it, Boris wants. Every person public position one power found following rules forced resign. he? that's people following rules anymore 'how come ok me?' employer (retail) using exact &lt;6 feet 15 minutes 48 hour deal.... nevermind fact I'm around coworkers closely ebb flow constantly span 8 hours day Coronavirus Cases:429,229
Deaths: 11,625

? supposed force cough. Read [the actual promising even article good. Actually state monopoly violence, basis civilized society. abour week* btw lol I'm exact situation you, except little bit younger - i'm gonna point virus seems long term effects showing *all* ages, including possibly permanent lung damage thing brain ageing 10 years 

I totally get saying honestly resonates pretty strongly me, immune Covid we're 20s  Lol sure even bothering run reelection? Seems like doy everything power lose. Percentage growth Bergamo Brescia lower areas Italy starting point high, given two hardest-hit provinces first wave.

That sort point tested positively..... positive direction! door greeter, told remind shoppers wear masks allowed enforce anything could discrimination, fair enough really wish could least challenge little bit Virus cares greatly moral indignation. country wish wage biological warfare would subtle ways even know. 

i.e. Sending agents contaminated everyday products, sending pre-symptomatic infected individuals know infected, even sending ""kamikaze"" infected terrorists.

Meanwhile, people would argue whether virus hoax, whether government orchestrated microchip everyone whether even deadly public health experts say. Well Fauci said don’t worry declining antibodies think good  sound deficient. Please seek help :) live SWPA. place see people wear WalMart enter restaurant. small businesses see anyone wearing one all. need prepared water, fertilize, prune though. 
This fear lost. 
In concept though, agree. Problem is, common US might ever know got - use lifts, hallways, shared spaces ventilated? could noone covid positive person you, could pick aerosols. 

I act every indoor space others go risk area even empty. take bins flat, walk shared hall (only 4 flats still.) goes mask glasses I'd say covid changed America like 9/11 airfare/travel, politics, terrorism, etc. say whole country irrevocably broken due it...which might worse impact 9/11. even heard theory. literally read first line 🙄 Eventually yeah, little kids often self centered (not fault, people are). understanding it’s unlikely give false positive, may give false negatives. test positive, know self-isolate don’t need get tested again, you’re negative still cautious. Also, many people get false negatives test positive later there’s virus system detected, retesting catch cases later. can’t certain doesn’t mean there’s little value learning can. Sanitary system ""collapse"" march, even brescia. we're light years away they're closing everything again, absolutely reason shop's closed winter? love (note, /s) conservatives claiming pandemic politicized politicizing it. us complying much can, however can. pandemic, nothing politics. freaking President one doubled politicizing it. Per friends OC, Democrat? No. One went party Airbnb house twenty people. masks social distancing. around 100 friends hang socially across two groups people 4 us go party take children trick treating last night. mean, fair, US soldiers also value freedom living... Ugh Fauci’s estimates conservative. November arrived, winter month half away… Actually no.

Stores insurance. think bank allows set limit online banking account (Sparkasse) reason get tested make sure asymptomatic carrier may given people, maybe got person turned asymptomatic carrier may spreading right now. Around (Oakland county, Michigan) plenty testing sites, Many free, well urgent cares types testing. plug Covid testing google phone get huge list. literally wrote read comment. thing contradicted yourself. Keep America Great! Could provide source that? would good handy. say reinfection wasn’t rare? might missed statement based actual quote chair vs. headline. Okay think I’m going crazy initially read comment literally think read words “it actually isn’t rare” shit least interpreted like that. bad made dismiss bc wrong declarative statement. I’ll read I’m done cooking americans always make lol someone explain functionally many testing? physically how? get population go along ? everyone replicate Self swabbing reliable enough. people wrong way. That's something people would learn unless pursuing career heavy math/statistics though. like expecting comp sci major know mechanisms specific drug interacts body. smart person still lack specific knowledge field. Germany term Lemonade used softdrinks, get called brand. 

But general bureaucracy strict allowed call juice, need call extract on. customer always call juice despite law enforcing ""extract"" country election system straight 19th century frontier land.

Oh, wait. UK celebrates Premiere League wins. person maths.... lol. Brits. guess plan staying homes forever. virus stay. proven immunity even post-infection. want do? Lock home stay ""alive"" till die something else? Well need said, people 👏 talk 👏 like 👏 👏 idiots. ~~*Meth*~~ *Covid. We're it. ^^^(but ^^^still ^^^on ^^^meth ^^^too!) drive testing? really cancel appointments get test results back. Could unkempt nose hair protect one Coronavirus? see another filter behind mask. bushy, thick nose hair could help capture virus bind vulnerable ACE2 receptors. brown one. 

A white terrorist would lone wolf ofc. Shouldn’t targeted hallucinogenic state would vulnerable… What's supposed happen two weeks? Seriously, explain logic behind 2 week time frame me. part got tested today tested negative! problem half population bitterly opposed regulations Half Americans done virus even virus done us. half afraid shadow call surge assume way say it'll another spike first wave. antibody tests wildly immaculate, unfortunately. 

Unrelated fact, mom exact experience OP. Finally got antibody year last month came back negative. I've one guy lick fingers ""clean"" pin. bit shocked say anything. definitely cleaned letting anyone else touch it. spotted one person wearing mask (excluding kids) recently. recorded zero cases day. 

Before requirement see occasional 1 person couple wearing one situation. Oh 5am today wondering wtf wrong me?  Care elaborate? fail see could draw conclusion based said. case years ago new,, particularly Google translate good languages days( even oddballs like Hungarian Finnish) Fair enough, obviously that's right. sounds little stupid selfish me. policy, goes effect Wednesday, apply travel New York neighboring states Connecticut, New Jersey, New York, travelers required quarantine three days getting another test. second test negative, traveler longer required “If test says you’re positive, remain quarantine,” Cuomo said. “If choose get tested, remain quarantine 14-day New York resident traveling outside state 24 hours must follow New York resident leaving state less 24 hours required take second State officials said new requirement enforced way previous 14-day quarantine policy, travelers asked fill questionnaires. policy leans individual compliance. could’ve done without draconian lockdown measures Socially changed. travel wise well. got pandemic pup life different. 
I worry older relatives more. trick-or-treaters door directly, parties found so... guess returns work Monday condition it’s different? lot gaps errors read comment. Regardless know tons couples one doesn’t they’re forced either use personal time possibly lose job go work unknown you’re experiencing symptoms.

Thanks douche though, makes point 100% effective. went wrong summer camps :(  Rookie numbers, bud. mean already see huge number restaurants allow people dine indoors cold outdoors enough space set booths outdoors. see urban areas restaurants 2nd+ floors get away packing restaurant fully inside without people suspect would ground level. Unfortunately, right. Depending virus mutates, may still get there. evidence suggest getting deadlier Europe. death rates escalating. still pretty early second/third wave. think election forced FDA US companies slow down. aware election occur first.

It adds weeks timeline anyway. Orange County always Mickey Mouse place Third? still first wave worth get tested? feel awful fever 102 etc. bother test self quarantine wonderful 1 65 people covid statistic! accuracy tests also 60-70%. think safe say, even safe say definitely safer assume stay home say anything 2 weeks. happens state run Republicans trying keep inline Trump's constant dismissing virus masks. people rural areas smaller cities West Texas Panhandle buy message disregard masks social distancing. least guys plan sticking it, adapting needed. 

Japan done ZERO, everything back full swing since end March. Everyone knows they're reporting true number cases here, we're hoping transmission limited viral load low due like 90% population wearing masks. We've real lockdowns social distancing all. People keep going even sick.

If like staying indoors, guest. asked employer, hospital, get tested, told go one urgent care locations. Urgent care different ER. warning wait would like urgent care, even staff kept lying much longer wait going be. insurance specific. example, get prescriptions filled hospital hospital's urgent care locations, they're covered pharmacy. free test site near us besides health department trying avoid could get rapid test, health department yet. ones work costumer service? I'm becoming student next yea need part time job support I've always done workingin costumber service. Canadian here. often go U.S. travel. took U.S. ages even support pin codes. pin 5 years even encountered U.S. retailer machine accept them. probably take amount time pay wave. 

I've Australia times they're ahead Canada. Pay wave everywhere, even things like donation boxes soda machines. Oh daily thread forgot daylight saving time hour early today haha. Hope everyone kept safe Halloween even though know didn’t, I’m sure. paranormal, tell, either isn’t real doesn’t affect fun trying last night… understand, state matter tired it. entire administration guaranteeing people way go susceptible population unfortunately believes administration so......... Wow, Navajo nation still hard time. :( thought tightened things up, guess many live multigenerational families interdependent. say he's also positive got caught antigen test.

Not safe say. Overall SAR \~30%, although somewhat higher spouses Halloween? think lead surge cases US, Ireland UK widely celebrated? MIS stating stats 

Because don’t know infected got infected Slovakia 50k people isolate track see contacts isolate truth fair spreading demagogy ;) vaccine, case. nothing brave, legality   great deal homelessness there, can't helping. Australia says hello even enforce many countries without going Human Rights laws. New Zealand locked people hotels without giving individuals choice. interesting

You take away numbers article think China ""Cyberpunk 2077"" millions, tens millions people infected.

In fact, number people infected Kashgar 200.

How else would say ""mainstream Western media"" shameless? Trump sometimes calls liberal media ""Fake News.""

The fact Western liberal politicians never reflect to, liberal media using old uninspiring ways talking.

If America's elite politicians continue like this, America nation inevitably decline

The goes media. ""Western mainstream media"" eventually become obsolete.

Check article, thought CNN still living Cold War era

Remember Cold War ended December 25, 1991? support argument seasonal factors least partly driving infections? Unfortunately kind threads becoming rife ""refined sociopolitical analyses"" differences East West - single culture way life, know - determined response pandemic. 

It's obviously unadulterated horseshit. 

Now, undermine Australia's response, excellent worthy praise. says nothing Australia vs. say, average european country.

The way go Australia NZ lockdown early zero near zero cases. keep borders closed, trace extensively, quarantine shit everyone entering.

That EXACTLY several European countries did. Greece, Ireland, Denmark, Austria Slovenia locked early weathered first wave successfully, keeping deaths low recording little excess mortality. Germany also kind same. Even Italy itself, caught completely guard beginning, enacted harsh lockdown several regions zero cases while. summer kept tracing extensively mask compliance countries almost 100% least indoors.

Unfortunately, afford keep borders closed long term. Freedom movement people goods VITAL European economic engines keep running. right learning open borders virus BOUND come back, unless Korean-style tracing system trace much enough anyways (see Germany).

What countries keeping control? Four islands (Taiwan, Japan, Australia NZ) one de facto island (Korea) also tracing system would unacceptable west would viewed blatant privacy violation.

Then Mongolia, Vietnam China, closed borders. land crossings, international transit hubs like London (except China, survive huge domestic market), international trains (well obviously, controlled), commuting flows countries, etc. Plus also countries bordering Vietnam recording zero cases.

China also HUGE luck mostly localised outbreak. things spiraled control Wuhan, virus still significantly spread outside Hubei.

Plus, previous experience SARS MERS.

Their response would maybe possible Iceland, Canada even UK. Thinking keeping border checks indefinitely between, say, Netherlands Belgium absolutely ridiculous. like closing border Tokyo Nagoya. temporary, spring.

Unfortunately, Europe really bad spot fight start. Maybe locked together end February...maybe. several European countries react swiftly effectively resources had.

So, again, happy Australia, I'm getting tired reading ""cultural analysis"" overgeneralised bullshit sub. isnt? maybe today. threshold alarm ICU 30% covid full. regions like mine there. already it. need black plague hinder society's ability work. think stroll soldier ambulance's time response hour like lombardy march, dunno, think big delusion late people believe misinformation school 40 years probably picked book since time.

I'm saying kids impressionable, know there's bad information internet. parents never learned think read internet quality read *newspaper.* Newspapers perfect sued, unlike reelTRUTHnow.biz /r/conspiracy Yeah, nothing going come election anyway. fact FDA probably western regulator carrying rolling reviews, ironic considering much sub pushed ""corrupt FDA"" narrative. could delay approval weeks US. Lol objectively wrong literally phrase used many vaccines atm used many people still crying abt bc lost argument

If like staying indoors, guest. According conservative mother Wisconsin, first rising positive numbers Wisconsin college kids, she’s given said deaths WI people pain want die. She’s happy Captain goes ship seems vague me. said better alternative. able get work done 4 days cares Fridays? huge number, especially considering false negative potential tests used. Australian, hard get head around Europe could drive three countries way grocery store. chance closing borders. It’s dumb. say Europe save Slovakia ""total lockdown""? Oh thought doctor would like risk see covid patient face face guess read somewhere even enough people living higher certain latitude. Enforced who? UK police numbers cut 25,000 last 10 years Well ""missing"" work, missing extra weekend pay.
It's time off, chose extra work even though he's possitive.
If read carefully said yoi go pain writting that. Bless Dr.

Keep telling truth!

Tell LOUDER! know. people start gasping panicking annoying create panic around situation necessary not. got SAD lamp? so, make difference? hospitals US (where live major areas) capacity going start taking people according risk. always detectable; underlying conditions aware of. family one copy leiden factor V, increased risk contract corona virus. 

 I'm loss anymore. people still tried trick-or-treat, saw recklessness everywhere. solace I've recently Whole Foods everything clearly labeled social distancing. There's lot relief fact one else get elevator shopping partner. Coverage protests always exaggerates severity. still arguing this? Texas legally state, country. England legally country. There’s really much else say suggest study Magna Carter, Wikipedia educational corner internet. let go man!  Pass Corona.. Where's proof? Oh wait, right, any. troll you. objectively correct literally hundreds millions doses made 3 vaccines combined. 

Uh, kiddo, go back school. assuming currently work. ""Promising results"" call scientific world ""Maybe, maybe not."" functioning vaccine yet. 

And got sent report world harassment :). good day. Others call _courtesy_. Along others said, Melbourne long considered one left/progressive cities, pride cultural capital Australia.

They done amazingly, really - city hard imagine coming together this. Many young adults around country move city image that's shown deserved here. Props them.

Although even say that, even think ""if city could done this, would Melbourne"", feel probably would done state govt decided to, tbh. state Australia widespread covid, attempting get rid rejoin rest Australia seems ""unaustralian"" me. Why? wish could take idiots local US idiots send island somewhere...wait minute...  That's great analogy. like burning book agree contents. 
""Sorry Grapes Wrath, Depression real, onto BBQ grill go."" Squirts lighter fluid.  Man, idea. People want anything web free... problem entire summer develop good plan. testing? done go basically. plan, nothing, PM went like YOOO TESTING EVERYONE BIGGEST OPERATION EUROPE I'M BEST LOOK ME. 

He going crazy every 2 days press conference summer 2-5 new infected daily. Crying people wear masks, went wedding without mask. on. bought 15 mil tests secret well, are. dispute 230k dead solely corona figure. quite like remaining elderly relatives alive possibly heart attack cheers.

I sacrifice christmas that. Yes wrong. England country all. literally every definition word. England first national division sovereign nation like 50 states USA. Destroying health, sake health. Go Slovakia! „Tja“. Much eloquent. sufferer SAD, I've taking Vit 4000iu daily since May. Hoping it'll help year. Media knows bad news gets clicks. seeing split ones want inform ones want maximum eyeballs page. splitting difference saying things. 🤷 email sent NHS Lothian director David Small Health Social Care Partnership (HSCP) members different local authority areas, outlines scale operation explains: ""Timescales uncertain, working assumption vaccine available mid-December 2020. could easily infected again. instances different strains way confirm reinvention, bc know resurgence virus not. But, like said, gain long standing immunity coronavirus, even somehow magically 12 (last checked) strains get infected from. already talking vaccine boosters yearly bc *scientists know long standing immunity* Yes it’s doable. Slovakia great thing good example rest world. probably bought wrong ones. They're idiots mean deserve fucking die. wrong man correct. assume positive cases tests 10 days, currently infected 50000, get 50000/10=5000 per day. means 50% positives actually captured regular testing. see, thinks type science technology comes Asia, Africa, Latin America ""a complete scam"". I'm side here, even hint racism post. it’s going like happened Melbourne, expect police enforcing rules. Instead calling Thanksgiving, people calling “Kill-your-family-day” Texas literally “parliament” laws too. think it’s “country” doesn’t mean muh freedumbs! around 1k mean? could 1k, long it’s around it.

Below 1k anything would say dismiss someone claimed 1k.

Together, 2 expressions make zero sense.

Also, source? accurate test used? 99% like RT-PCR tests used elsewhere result region false positives. going school worse kids coronavirus. spent time money (at federal level) making sure education safe time. lucky enough move place good school district they're careful. Poorer districts lucky. society really value education way we're suffering terrible lack federal government leadership right now. I'm American know personalities background people.

That said, I'd say someone repeat obvious clearly getting enough people help 1,000 losing lives daily basis.

'Same England, obvious needs stating again. get everyone, may get alone save lives. You’re next door neighbors. care. help keep us informed posting English language articles here. telling way is? guess often politics trump lies constantly redefining herd immunity order make impossibility. Congrats guess? many people blame White House pandemic... They've locked prisons area US. I'm certain lockdown everyone coming, parties saw advertised. Huh? Aside striking issue English language, also seem problem basic arithmetic. U.S. actually worse UK/Europe; difference remains seen death rate. that's waiting game.   different mutated strain strain. can't immune something never had. No, pubs bars PACKED every weekend cities. Closing make big difference. Cases Liverpool gone lot since entered Tier 3. fat enough land hospital weeks, matter young are. What's antigen test? antigen antibody? conclusion test outcome ask for?

I able read article due language. rare occurrence, people typically die. Excess deaths better way see true toll US. bypasses whole cause death argument simply looks amount extra deaths reported year.

This Johns Hopkins article good job meant literacy instead literature, literacy rates US [have gone Illiteracy among whites .04% 1976 1.6% minorities. Since 1990, literacy rate US stayed steady teacher? I’m curious taught reading 4-7 year olds 6 years ELL students 2 children learn read pretty easily. Also wasn’t arguing homeschool all, pointing time kids learned read home versus school public schools US thing. every measure delay. Like lockdown still next two weeks continue exponential growth hospitalized people. starts going down. much couldn't. Didn't. pretty excited this. browsing made smart ass comment kept going. Let go stop douche. weekend short Yup surface transmission fear-mongering needs stop. companies need stop implying sanitizing way go tell people wear damn mask. focus both. still early stages pandemic, might point. test infrastructure adapted rapidly providing results contact tracing travesty. capable controlling this. actual contact tracing place, could actually safely open much more. Here's ranking current hot spots state (7-day average per capita heat map showing data states ranked total per capita plan wear mine sick go out, “after” COVID-19 Trump Rallies religion. Utah conservative state many people listening science reason. Lol @ post history dick people anyways yeah I'm objectively correct literally hundreds millions doses made 3 vaccines combined. USA least enough March/April. mention pandemic ends at-risk healthcare workers vaccinated death rate drops, every single human earth gets it. Also vaccines mentioned EXTREMELY promising results far.

So yeah every point made proved wrong. Looks like one writing garbage eh

/u/blazingsaint get load guy Frankly, less Facebook fact people critical thinking skills. Facebook, would lunch room office gossipy neighbor next door Art Bell like radio program. Facebook took online, made international widespread.

We need start teaching critical thinking skills school. need teach it’s ok question things... take anything faith seek proof. question get info from... world would anyone take information random post internet 99.999% scientists/ medical professionals beyond me. prepare. entered state contingency September. However, reason, work. Cold weather helps virus survive longer air. get PCR done want sure false positive not. 30% chance positive still test negative virus yet developed body. tests 95% accurate 30% chance false negative, that's 2 rounds false negatives 1st round would definitely become positives second. mind asking, Halloween party day Halloween? enough population say small margin error many total cases are? Ie assuming 1% people there's ~500k cases total? would put (reported) death rate somewhere around .03% according deaths google. mint ones taste nice 2% infected, 60% sensitivity = 1,2% true positives. 98% * 99,7% specificity = around 0,3% false positives. Meaning 1 5 false positive. Here's latest ranking US states total per capita states ranked 7-day running average deaths (current hot extreme curves one. irony? Experts repeatedly said weather major factor, neither surface transmission. Simple that. 

Why hell Asian countries similar trends, Australia New Zealand? comes people responsible authorities taking serious, that's all. That's about. 

It's global fucking pandemic, sorts stats, graphs etc meticulously reported, there, take genius look understand. IFR=.23% estimated median. higher places lower others. Looks like Belgium former. think could challenging. test negative one day next test positive. MIL tested negative next day started start feeling sick went tonget tested following day tested positive. 

It would good regardless quarantine ones tested positive limit exposures people havent tested positive. Science takes awhile. may never know. best day pray future generations information people willing trust scientists. fucking sucks get abuse. people really terrible people :(

Does store security? ! honestly boggles mind. I’m singapore least semblance normality - everything mostly open people things. Surely minor inconvenience mask triumphs personal liberty? see UK Europe going 2nd lockdowns think wore masks! validated dan andrews must feel right ❤😛 happened Salt Lake City, northern part state news source St George. whole state experiencing recent surge Covid cases Utah's major hospital ICU's capacity. state recently sent mass text everyone state warning surge asking everyone wear mask socially distance. Why? 

Not respecting measures? Large gatherings? same, wear 4-5 layer cloth masks, one layers filter material rated filter 95% particles, that's easy purchase. make sure mask tight face, air goes mask around it. Still 100% effective, want walk COVID ward it, feel comfortable enough public it. catch thing would likely someone household tighten enough. threats mostly, people usually comply... there's lot conspiracists, course. that's different thing. Texas also leads California per capita deaths. Here's latest 64.38 deaths per 100k. ranks 19th per capita at? City Pittsburgh times I've small shops mask use almost universal. course restaurants bars different story. picked 25,000 people isolate spread unknowngly others... alone fantastic result. TL;DR I'm 99.9% accurate predicting hurricanes saying one tomorrow everyday. people use ""model""? No, absolutely not. positive get ""quarantine leave"", basically sick leave, means paid sick days course. exceptions leave basic things - getting food, water, maybe grandma needs help dog needs shit.. correct. States cannot restrict movement states. outside scope legal authority. get exposed virus again, body combat pathogen easier, still carry around infect people. way Victoria lockdown would work US. People would rioting freedomz oppressed. already minority causing trouble Melbourne. Seriously, Joe Rogan really bad take this. I’ve lost respect him. World War Z book (and ""prequel"" Zombie Survival Guide book) use fictional virus ""solanum"" way zombies created. yes, technically virus outbreak lot mechanisms described stories used potentially used real life :-) Extra money added state unemployment benefits.

South Dakota need it. ones without bootstraps die /s questions:

1) sure Singapore didn’t equivalent innovation statistics?

2) Singapore copycat Dutch? Maybe Dutch yet prove capabilities 90% accuracy rate Singapore done?

Until two questions answered, there’s evidence Singapore’s copycat Repub way thinking look dominic cummings barnard castle G'day covid goodbye covid telling forcing people quarantine right get plane? obvious Corona virus gets worse winter. proportion people indoors poorly ventilated spaces proportion vitamin deficiency? think interesting open question Shit. Innscurate* week even worse, poor kids. thought month quick guess worse Spaces commas? WTF? policy, goes effect Wednesday, apply travel New York neighboring states Connecticut, New Jersey, Pennsylvania. Well, simple - account lower sensitivity Ag tests used. many positives missed.

Also, soon evaluate fatality rate, deaths lagging indicator (it takes time disease worsen enough cause death - least weeks). daily death counts increasing get worse since near full capacity hospitals, care patients getting worse. includes future patients, tested positive. Yes info two countries planning kind testing? I'm Hungarian I'd love too. Oh France Western European country? 

Ohh anti American garbage low lives. 

Must US Yes is. called statistics :) many robust reliable tests answer questions. Super weird seeing many people Instagram partying there’s pandemic going tests, find cases - DJT

When tests, find valuable information - Science Exactly. potential get really really bad here. :( much media hyping demonstrations? It’s hard tell bad is. It’s you, I’ve seen several times Florida Midwestern American, inspires me. Great job! bad won’t happen administration. Scott Atlas, top adviser White House Coronavirus Task Force, appeared Saturday Russian state media argue lockdowns, Newsweek reported.

Of course he’s going Russians. Let take terrible advice. Depends ask, people think go away Tuesday. imagine place social structure support broken economy... tones kids go public place get internet access (the US).

Our government essentially saying library Starbucks safer school (since kids go access internet ) Sweden disaster. Even best usa states would bad Australia standards. Victoria australias worse performing state 800 deaths (next worse 53) tried social distancing, work home options, restricted trading restaurants work American, selfish Amen.  Sweden section date. sharpened local restrictions several regions including 4 populated ones. CNN, shameless! people mass Vermont? One thing I've noticed anecdotally around schools clears plans (like mine) done wonderfully havent really cases yet all. schools acted shifted suddenly person way vague guidelines ones failed. think question open schools long clearly though defined plan They’re blatantly trying steal election might pull off, so. That’s probably why. spread increasing continuously! reached record levels summer hot weather supposed kill it, guess what, DIDN'T!

You one overlooking fact despite weather nothing really changed. That's it. Weather important factor, that's scientific consensus, get it.

Of course focusing spreading effectiveness, fucking virus spreads! contagious disease, else focus on? Surface transmission relevant, people get people most. Unless living grid information anyway. can't admit put good use. CD4+ cells help B cells produce antibodies help CD8+ cells kill virus-infected cells

Yeah uses certain words experts seem sure read entirety paper looks claiming infection fatality rate Across 51 locations, median COVID-19 infection fatality rate 0.27% (corrected 0.23%)

Where getting 0.01%? American want see completely agree you. 

I’ve lived China can’t wait visit it’s possible. Even hospitals fill big time? goodness man lol. 50 states USA exact things Scotland has. administration going put money schools. talking 30% approximately comparison pcr

who ""they""? study Geneva university showed 89% sensitivity vs PCR It’s clear you’re selfish care yourself. want know live yourself? Thanks explanation. 

I generally creep folks' comments frequent sub enough recognize usernames. 

Just figured he/she judged harshly specific comment. Yeah I'm socially acceptable, becoming mandated forever another story. doubt it. Besides federal government right shut shit regardless Central European country NATO EU definitely falls western developed nations although agree like cold war. Well done sir (madam?) ! Oh, wasn’t trying make 1:1 comparison. Rather comparing environment. Sounds like that’s fair comparison, even x flu cases doesn’t mean covid cases. 'except children 10.'

- that's spread virus, believe/s Oh. makes perfect sense then! part thought odd 3 people inside, 4 outside, unless 13. Lol. that's gonna even happen US A. Gloves! may expensive 

It's actually quite cheap, published contract supplier tests 40M Eur remember correctly special education school zero cases NY opened 10 weeks school. Mask wearing great basically keep classrooms completely separate one another. little time spent kids hallways. Kids within class allowed play one another long wear mask. "" ""What foresee successful vaccine continuation form public health measures, go progress months 2021, getting towards third fourth quarter, see considerable approach towards form normality,"" Fauci told Marr."" Third fourth quarter = summer fall. We've got long ways go. right.  

But America place default ""no school"". 

Most countries, even fearful, alternative days brief closures. Thank you. didn’t know worked noticed images without captions several stories. Get well soon! Try vodka bromhexin! :-D article linked uses terms like ""likely"" ""potentially"".

So, known sure T-cells prevent reinfection. Hopefully are. immaculate good thing? intention giving government information /or talking contact tracers compared weekend numbers weekday numbers? Clearly Democrat/CNN push numbers, destroy health system🤦🏻‍♂️ come guys makes everything even worse longer us... may well case taking safety measures cases threatening overrun healthcare system outlook vastly improve matter months vaccines treatments save many lives. Hopefully year covid nothing minor inconvenience handful die per day thousands. I’m willing make adjustments life meantime means save people preventable death. push numbers, destroy health system🤦🏻‍♂️ come guys makes everything even worse longer us... saying decades. critical thinking core class like math physical education huge error imho. anybody first-hand information situation (particularly regarding hospitals restrictive measures) Malaysia? seems well now. odd exactly? love complex rules many exceptions. thing !RemindMe 14 days push numbers, destroy health system🤦🏻‍♂️ come guys makes everything even worse longer data isnt even globally though. Keep mind almost countries keeping schools open point even go lockdowns. Theres real reasons schools last thing close. Sure Democrat Ye hope 40 years occupied USSR going permanently delete hundreds years European history. Elderberries probably best thing there. vitamin C Zinc added sell immune supporting. elderberries used long time immune help. You’d better taking separate supplement C Zinc it’s minimal.  Blue parts everyone wears it.

Red parts Well US never stopped it. US 1000 death/day several month roughly Germany 10 death day several month. question go back level time also increase? Numbers look like increase cases well far.  suggestion well grounded science. Yes, sicker COVID patients likely low Vit rest population. association, cause effect. example, nursing home pattens likely severe COVID likely outside soaking sunshine making vitamin D, worse outcome likely age co-morbidities, vitamin level. Young people U.K. don’t seem mentality. create that? community spirit among young already Australian culture? Oh, unfair. question begs answer gets post removed. Please...somebody say it. won't. may juvenile, I'm gonna it. Why? winter too, months later. government sane plan... Astonishing. 

Boris trying achieve R=1.0 madness. never get rid virus &amp; takes 30 years achieve herd immunity, concept even works covid19. One Nation Hanson. she’s removed politics covid now. understand you’re saying.

But never shifted consciousness. never lost sight needed done, saw Cummins real person fucked up, like time time. Yes he’s position power. Ok. So? Lmao I’ve never seen abbreviation Positivity still 30 percent though. think MERS less contagious. far sustained human human Truth dead. massive uncontrollable outbreak would even unlucky. am, think Slovakia’s citizens lucky government willing takes contain mitigate damages possible. Gosh, Earth possible? thought live lives stop we're virus. Congrats nations make hard choices, dispense sugar coating weak excuses. Bite bullet, enforce decisions try force virus-controlled future good nation. leadership. unpopular greater good. infuriating part living bullshit. People newsfeeds crowing MONTHS. spite rising infection rate, spite rising hospitalization rate, still nattering god damned ""survival rate"" still high.  


Because fuck fact ""low"" percentages representative hundreds thousands people died. classic representation statistics easily misrepresent qualitative data quantitative data. can't even argue dumb fucksticks. Election. let education get way facts... Fuck covid truther scum earth. Since February I've used either card card holder punch pin. need touch it. Financial support lockdown. doesn’t work otherwise people can’t afford feed families. needs political will. We’re fortunate conservative federal government come around agreed pay it, competent thing managed do. rest executed competent state government, including border controls, masks manufacturing mask mandate. sure problem one us mental block numbers.

Sure, 6M lot. 'most' means half.

I stand said: get payment. Everything’s bigger Texas! think part people right thing, heavy fines restrictions put place. people encouraged call cops people right thing - labelled ""UnAuStRaLiAn"" think particularly younger people opinion thing fucked sooner get better everyone involved. 你是看最近的睡前消息了吗 No. can't. sounds like person story could gone existing dedicated test site? instead going fuckin hospital??? lmao Silly sounds, wonder might actually help vaccine finished Trump's term ends. way Fauci scientists say safe people believe it, Trump crow take credit followers want discredit it. 

If vaccine completed Biden half country seriously open believing giant conspiracy. 😕 countries this? Seems like good way protect economy. reason CCDC doesnt want antigen tests used. don’t think alone thinking that. It’s reprehensible. Sayint political issue Europe correct. lot political fights deal it. strong divisive US 2 political parties. real real. hoax plot depopulate earth. hoax kills old people. government trying kill you, go party without mask.

Welcome upside world. down. Hot cold. Oceania always war Eastasia. destruction certain large power, rest world seems better ability plan future. Ironically COVID might end saving planet. far...WA also well quarantine area (keep please). Although 50 cases last Thursday(?) travellers quarantine. Also 'local area borders' put place quite early, mostly protect Indigenous also 'localised' potential spread. America always number 1 Contactless card payments use years. Hold card close card reader. People seem get message lockdown last resort ""the law"". would great see governments hospitals world maximize patient throughput minimal loss life really happens people go spread loads covid burst hospitals. like watching someone lose RTS game units went random stuff think closest truth here, personally see someone breaking rule that's peoples' safety, regardless whether pubished go break rule myself

I'll still get mad punished it, I'm struggling get head people would want break rules someone else interesting approach, likely effective long term anyone entering country immediately tested well. enforced? Would people comply? curious current leadership majority democratically elected point, they. large enough group supporters. Instead quarrelling majorities, look results. allowed do. Y'all got stop morbid humor begin acting. joking imo seems reinforce sense helplessness, like Americans powerless.

You hardly protested fascist genocidal leader, much could doing. You’re correct antigen tests faster they’re accurate PCR tests. It’s easier miss active covid infection antigen tests. stand said. (probably) reasons behind decision media public aware of.

I say probably chance may right (but think so). Yes, positives required go 10 day quarantine home. fact positivity all... people willing take risk children's lives? time someone detected, lead-time disease, already spread least one time test positive? Yeah ""backed out"" court case gave evidence favour Palmer basically damage done. irony started president wanted deter Mexicans wall. people want asylum Canada, able easily due protected borders. person asymptomatic, would reason tested. Positives supposed self quarantine 10 days. testing issue certificate anti counterfeit markings stating result. police checking people street, malls, etc, must carry certificate time. Testing supposed repeated next weekend follow negatives see. bit obtuse here. needed got paid. Plenty jobs affected, need it. would way compliance.

No, would bunch republicans guns marching front lawns democrat mayors.

America brutish kind reasonable lockdown work. feel anxious, agree strangely comforting. wear two masks (normal hygiene mask face, cloth top) like nice warm face hug temperatures dropping. Can't wait get wool masks winter. :) Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* what? contact tracing? next step insure people space money isolate? literally turning point majority people knew followed rules religiously said ""fuck it"" collectively.

They still take precautions rules government implements feel like anything enforced.

They scream can't afford furlough again... fining people complying mask mandate public transport could made mint. tube morning distressing anger inducing journey work... nose mask wearers make rage ones obviously give shit wear one... im saying people going die virus matter what, 



Places take seriously fewer cases. Less spread. Less death.


Quit defeatist attitude. People low vit Scotland far north also cloudy rainy--we get basically sun winter. 

I think food supplementation would help. looks like one company launched vitamin milk, seen it. PCR accurate tests. facts Federal Government supported lawsuit Clive Palmer try force WA open borders united Western Australian population, backed months in.

In span time, law change, constitution sure hell didn't. Worked Melbourne, Australia. no, experts say that, may, many also advocate hard, short lockdowns. November great start

&amp;#x200B;

elections fun Texans like out-done California. ;) agree, part think we're pretty compliant rules government enforce, need keep enforcing reminding us risk. last lockdown one's pushing us streets back schools, hopefully much staggered approach opening up. Hospitalisations virus going fall 4 weeks, lockdown probably extended another 3 weeks hopefully reopen, rishi buy presents help scheme. 

We capacity almost 500k tests day that's going improve time, staggered release lockdown even testing hopefully get next opening right. Also, I'd like believe majority population plan flying around Europe like summer discuss school closures, I'm sure people distinguishing secondary schools primary schools. 

Your link clearly shows secondary schools, transmission rates still high. look 'nice bribery'. 'We'll give $x stay home shops/pub/work bit. going plan, back fam-bam Xmas'. test positive antigen, almost absolutely test positive PCR. problem false negatives. plan test everyone next weekend, see. works, soon kid tests positive whole class isolated tested. mass testing schools positivity rate lower elsewhere Ah, guess it’s credit then. always use credit, tap. wondering many people saying enter pins. Ohh single leaked email well MUST completely true...derp. definitely feels way.  they? talking COVID ones? COVID gonna rushed well might be. Public health harm reduction, impossible get people entirely stop things; people going celebrate holidays despite Covid, like people going sex despite STIs existing. cases, yes, ""just anything"" safest, that's message, outcomes worse lot people go thing. say, ""here's thing safely"" people likely listen you, overall outcome better. Still could longer immunity seems pretty decent atm honestly know bit anyways much anything bad. could maybe see turmeric useful, often recommended autoimmune disorders. However, others snake oil. They're better making sure get enough Vitamin B12 (two chronically low patients autoimmune disorders). Vitamin fat soluble, that's Fauci's asking people take milk bread (calcium also enhances D). Vitamin B12 water soluble, whatever use, piss out. Ah yes see mean. 2.500.000 tests one day huge congrats Slovakian people. However even get 3.500.000 4.000.000 wont leave lets assume 40.000 confirmed cases.

You'll need add 1.000.000-2.000.000 get tested treat potential cases. still tough case solve besides cost effort put forth. Kids allowed Corona back then. people ""innovators""  positive antigen test mean active case still pass people objects people might touch. It’s hard wear mask wear one anyway avoid risk potentially spreading Coronavirus. I’d say benefit economy lack deaths coronavirus numbers dropping worth minor inconvenience wearing essentially new piece clothing. Exactly!!!!! NYC daily cases risen 200-300/day 600-800 day hospitalizations deaths yet followed.  indirect evidence reduced viral load via near universal mask wearing decent adherence NPI's work. 

Fingers crossed true continue careful avoid surges, No, cards tap places shop now. It’s possible stores don’t yet though. Tumeric generally considers anti-inflamatory. Read comment. concept breathalyser isn’t new. Singapore indeed FIRST adapt detect Covid, highly doubt Dutch Company yet achieve another one pfizer 100 million end year forever champ. lost argument get tested, necessary them. People need get test result go work, example, encouraged get tested.

People self isolate without much sacrifice risk (that is, mostly retired people) encouraged rather stay home quarantine (with exceptions, e.g. grocery shopping) especially cautious either way, since level risk getting infected testing stations. big problem antigen test takes least seven days you’re infected start antigens virus, least researching company worked time (April), period thought people infectious days 2-5 infection. ex showing mild symptoms years, onset came developed health problems end second pregnancy. developed butterfly rash joint pain. ran fever 10 days jaw muscles swelled much could eat soup.  Yes. It’s called T-cell immunity, we’ve known months. 

Yes, small minority (emphasis small) people get reinfected reasons unclear. feel like I'd still want test prisoners. 

But maybe that's I'm part Slovak government. honest, antibodies last 5 months nothing brag about. enough time that's past since pandemic started study long term immunity. still happen. cross reactivity contamination. [case local newspaper couple days ago woman positive result antigen test later get negative result PCR. same. Dutch company managed adapt invention detect Coronavirus? 

The idea breathalyser means new invention. Hell, don’t even think concept patented.

The idea breathalyser means new invention. Hell, don’t even think concept patented.

What Singapore managed adapt detect Coronavirus. So, would mind highlighting copycat? design? novel ability detect virus (which don’t think Breatho**mix** ) yet achieve)? Wow fck fck fck fck. That's peak infection. really isnt, look comparrison bars parties orgies. principles? defying health orders? right party? 

that complete lunacy. wonder cancelling Christmas turn bunch people ""never-torys""

The Simpson's reference, anyone get it. 90% time people choose bury head sand via distraction. I'll take ""stay fuck home"" $500 Alex. No, didn't. quoted excerpt said deal made future vaccine, current one. sample size large enough see 1% side effects quite clearly, would affect hundreds trial participants Didn’t accuse Swedish doctors number human rights violations based newspaper articles? guess it’s factual accusations haven’t verified yet can’t really forego conclusion. people comprehensively screwed (especially US) kids get school based interventions therapies, many time sensitive. can't take year of, say, sensory therapy autistic kid. Missing year disastrous. could handled shutting society sake keeping schools open, could handled sending regular school kids home disadvantaged kids could get therapies. we've got WRONG.  literally quoted o________o American Way. Again, here. Try reading posted. joke. Close damn night clubs. That's strange. Tumeric echinacea often used immune support herbs. assuming goal *isn't* harm people sending healthy family members situations carry virus back bother. Nothing wrong bit optimism either. point event refuse accept situation England, staring us face, individual contribution helping people around us; vaccine arrive we'll way disaster. buy kn95 masks?
Are ones Amazon legit? Yep. See subsequent post, first I’ve heard too. Interesting keep mind, since one issues Covid over-inflammation. Inflammation natural, maybe would ok, maybe much avoid these? rate, I’d like hear newer, reputable advice. That's actually something skills shortage list. also pays quite well Australia. Well, yeah, doubt that.

However, lot stuff consider. lot uncertainty would go, planned short amount time, huge portion people actually put lot time preparations know two weeks ago. operation basically big elections (considering swab stations selected based polling places), organized several months happen, happen regularly, pretty much uncertainty. president, leader armed forces, informed it, even though army organized it. miracle went well did. state government owes lot military local administrations good job ensured little chaos weekend. communication government good could easily gone lot worse.

The parameters tests used also questionable, although turns least specifity much higher originally expected, give us reasonably accurate map prevalence (if false positivity higher, get this, country would homogenous positivity rate). Hopefully lead false negatives spreading would without getting tested, give false sense security.

All all, seems like turning great result, might end negative consequences well - let's forget thousands medical professionals already overworked tiring weekend. thousands military members worked project taken duties regional disease control centers, crucial days. Last least, non-zero risk testing lead spread hundreds people tested single space (thousands places), medics swabs unable swap gloves swab due shortage PPE. doubt people gotten infected testing stations, hopefully huge number.

I agree, end, shaping fantastic result, lot done better frustrated handled politically top level. lower levels government, military, many health professionals, volunteers, owe thanks to. USA years decades away mythical utopia herd immunity. no, late. need critical thinking. stuff hear astounding.  lot people decided area, yet positives ever increasing. Yeah mean like 5-6 days. really low % upto 14 days. 

I mean yeah, safety first, rules gonna happen again, may enough teachers.

Anyway, good news seems no-one else school tested positive shows safety measures must something People really isolated Korea, kept entertainment venues closed larger cities want crowds. vaccines exempt liability claims  hope they’ve found something helps. Also kids better wearing masks think us realized. 3yo just.... problem it. mind different told wear underwear boots raining. preschool initially said require 3yo group wear masks kids good changed guidance. Watch share video people Couple issues here: prevalence certain region may lower 2%, sensitivity asymptomatic cases may low 30% specificity determined lab conditions much lower number samples. huge sadly missed opportunity validate tests large scale testing much less ideal conditions. rhetoric getting nuts. ""flailing""? without jobs self imposed shutdowns. ourselves! I'm saying poor coronavirus response. shut down. pretend China cares people imposing dictatorial shut downs slaughtering Muslims. Live free die mother fucker. Dude lol babysit ""May 12: DoD HHS announced $138 million contract ApiJect 100 million prefilled syringes distribution across United States year-end 2020"" like dude one downvoted ppl google searches Watch share video people Watch share video people [k, almost Europe restricted movement, curfews closed shops restaurants Holy crap look fuckin dolt. What's rationale behind testing people retirement? mean, that's science say? Sorry little bit unpopular opinion, *want* wear mask; *have* order keep others safe. Wait.. 1% cases 50% population tested?....
.. guess isn’t testing problem.. Yep, short term pain long term gain. imagine that's Chinese felt strict lockdown beginning year.

When case numbers low, much easier track contain new outbreaks. We've seen half measures taken, always come roaring back loosen up. case levels West comfortable restrictions triggers localized lockdown China.

How many people die set goal eradication local transmission rather mere reduction (aka flattening curve)? Open 8 days,12 schools affected,31cases+,we staying hybrid. far working this,I work special needs children,it horrible trying person remote,its loud,administration day, teachers pulled class quarantine, subs,are capable running class,people fearful, rooms cleaned sanitized properly ( coming seeing food floor day before)

The children learning conditions, one day 110,degrees,the next day 40, temperature control also problem, getting colder outdoors.

There organization, ready opened,but pushed it,so would lose money ,per child,as parents threatened pull put districts.

There daily emails,letters,calls parents notices case quarantine, much back forth, everyone stressed burnt out.

The superintendent says no,the cases spreading schools, township, close sees tick cases.

The numbers seem good,and shame forced in,instead waiting things organized, done properly vaccine numbers lower. mind start using word?  Read article; vaccine here. They're talking process IT. 

Bye now. unable prove anything said. Texas cases, even contest. Dallas county 14% right we're running short tests. El Paso's something ridiculous like 20%. “Takeaway pints?
Usually call “bottles” buy stores, bars... confirm Liaoning well. Mask still mandatory public transportation everything back normal. course still tension worrying resurgence nothing like beginning year whole city locked ghost town.  causes panicked buying? Fear external threat could impact supply items panic bought. buying shed full toilet paper panic buying due fear virus eating trees something.

Fear *of* panick buying necessarily mean panic buying themselves. preppers always stay fully stocked everything need afraid impact availability necessary goods due panic buying.

Or fear panic buying cam cause someone start panic buying themselves.

See difference? America biggest joke world stage since Trump become Potus. 

This pandemic ultimate test capability government. Judging situation, obviously Trump administration complete piece shit. Period. 

I’m empathetic toward really want take pandemic seriously, care protect lives. May Mother Nature protect virus. Officially Morons, yeah It'll make absolutely **no** difference who's WH. Biden anything without stimulus Congress. Congress anything without lobbyists handlers' permission, *will* take bribery, they'll worried bottom line. governors anything without money Congress FEMA. 

Basically, we're own. It'll come individual counties households making decisions. vaccine long way off, Americans (and others around world) better ready long haul two years economic recession/depression. problem, however, Americans resilient, well kill keep 2019 lifestyle. stay isolation days get tested arrival provide negative test enter country know that. better headline would ""England joins Wales Scotland nationwide shutdown, PM announces"" 1 4 people died got it

No, infected, almost 27% **hospitalized** patients.

Hats army, nobody believed could pull logistics nightmare little time prepare, everything incredibly well organized something scale. Spoken like child never felt dread knowing job still exists. might fiddling numbers one thing can't denied: they've taken **very** seriously. Chinese friend told visit parents Christmas lets say they'd spend month quarantine China (in proper facility)! Two weeks Beijing another two weeks get home city.

The one thing I've seen though throughout pandemic difference collectivist cultures v individualist cultures. general (though exceptions like NZ Australia) collectivist cultures seem done far better job handling - matter actual response country was. kids school northwest burbs Chicago reopened month closing again. kept remote saw coming. I'm seeing right I'm waiting board Spirit flight. Yay. paying becomes expensive long run, inconvenient. China wielded effectively.

I mean epidemic super easy squash hard fully agreed 3 week lockdown. Everyone stocks food (or delivered food government can't afford it) wait 3 weeks. Epidemic practically guaranteed burned practically 100%. 

In fact, 2 weeks might work. 

That would, retrospect, obviously best thing initially sick areas US.

Then areas cases simply isolate allow traffic without quarantine/tests out, vital material logistics organized human interaction.

This sort plan would saved sooooo much money bother, us emerging April practically zero cases.

The problem never properly.

Instead denying fire oxygen, gave little oxygen 4 months, gave lot again.

As healthcare system, somehow managed merge couple sensible options whole fact dumber sum parts. anything done definite exposure virus potentially prevent full disease? Medication instructions? viral load severity proven? paying attention new studies topic coming hospital March week. 2 people ward tested positive kept longer. got point healthy enough leave bit mother vulnerable, didn’t want send home.

So put travelodge 3 weeks, getting food packs local Sikh temple places.

After realised costing much keep us hotel (there others there). found 1 bed flat supposed temporary accommodation feeling I’ll while. dick-all thread know. It’s called analogy, dolt. 

You take pictures people event wearing masks ignore group aren’t. 

It’s like mostly peaceful protests. That’s another analogy didn’t understand it. Cameras lie. journalists. people like fall you’ve educated easily misled like sheep slaughter. NZ lockdown worked well too, NZ locked early, soon cases hit 100.  still spread lockdown without transmission chains stayed contained various households died out. There's lot extremely unpopulated areas, population lives coast, cities. Australia urbanized population US. Rural areas US able minimise infection, instead seemed *welcome it!* 4=6 month figure b.s. That's long antibodys detected blood long immune. would be? many triggered snowflakes. think are. Smoke weed.

I'm joking, fair, almost entire companies run zoom right now, lot money stake. underestimate it. increase sugar counteract decrease palatability resulting removal dietary fat food. like human centipede puppet situation. True there’s time place info like especially constructed way provides wrong message Remember, is. Never mind side effects minimal pop level vaccine. Even 1% pop ADE means population level vaccine. agree. sick since pandemic think wearing masks one reasons. Sounds like Chinese propaganda tests high specificity almost useless

It's useless prevalence low 50% chance false positive result. dont really buy tbh vaccine though? governments going cage us forever? Cable declining, else would boomers get news? ***Cries Southern Utah***

I live/work Lake Powell. 115* hottest day, usually hovered around 105-110 June August. Australia island, China enact much harsher measures western countries. 

Exponential growth works ways... get reproduction average rate you’ll soon get low enough numbers rely contact tracing quickly isolate hotspots 

The US point seems given going business usual ship sailed long time ago food distribution military/civil services, solve logistically? exceptions leave within 10 days? paid wages? Interesting approach, see immense difficulties much bigger countries (like Germany) countries population willingly cooperate. pathetic existence, like know it’s reddit people upvoting come man live little would really great least things people Asian countries became customs here. lived japan kid. dad first noticed flu isn’t rampant Japanese offices much American ones winter. culture workaholic here. People don’t like taking time off. wear masks. socially distance family members coworkers sick. sanitize surfaces. home couples even sleep separate beds one sick. result? Less sickness. Instead entire office class getting infected one two people would. Americans act like it’s inevitable one kid gets sniffles whole house get it, one person office gets sick everyone get it. family implemented quite habits. result growing up, colds flu didn’t spread readily household. Indirect blame incident? Sure. 
Direct?  No, unless trump friends Spirit CEO controlling like puppet behind scenes. Fluoride water... got point life actually feel comfortable going meeting new people. I'm giving virus less .0001% chance killing friends. I'm going recede progress made socially shut another 6 months, let alone years like people sub want

People risk shelter themselves. worry goals. Move NZ, they're like backdoor way Aus. ask Queenslanders. 

Or could try luck fishing boat Indonesia, might end wrong prison island.  Serious viral infections always potential induce autoimmune disorders. Rotavirus Herpes boring old Influenza. Given Covid little pathogenic commonly transmitted viruses, exploding rapidly macro scale, expect see larger usual quantity induced autoimmunity. Sorry what? Australia? Millions did. federal government completely washed hands it

You mean shut borders well countries implemented largest welfare spending since WW2? Come mate... Thanks. country normality long time. happy Victoria joining us. Thats like 40-70 times 9/11 deaths. 

You really consider labeling virus terrorist. would limit White House would stop it. Ironic Jeremy Corbyn removed Labour Party racism Especially troubling times impossible kids catch spread virus schools emerging understanding resistant it, don’t spread easily, don’t show many symptoms, schools significant source contagions. 

This may hold true young school-aged children, evidence points towards opposite teenagers college-aged students. think possible majority enough idiots party (IDS accused caving scientists). can't see labour rejecting though, they've calling national lockdown Tf wrong you, people dying Newcastle 770 cases single day student halls, definitely covid hotspots.

I think don’t want deal backlash parents feeling kids aren’t getting taught properly home, university students making (very fair) claim £9k per year use facilities getting 1 1 teaching massive rip off. Hang dry driving car alone see wife unwell? Corbyn perfectly fine dinner party 9 people family?

Durham police investigated told public move on, maybe take advice... Yeah, figured such. America bit dog eat dog feel? Could wrong thats seems outsider. People general even understand accuracy actually means, much less sensitivity specificity components vastly affect use test scale. Bayes' Theorem like 3 steps removed people's knowledge, sadly. pandemic shown anything, removing math requirements education fastest way scientifically illiterate populace.  Meanwhile Germany:

""350 people?! can't 2 weeks!"" think overestimate many Americans self awareness insights nuances propaganda. agree awful matter motive. Sounds like sequel fear loathing track trace system

Covid19 infectious several days people enough symptoms decide get test covid19. implicit delay, test needs take less day. Otherwise tracing people already infected several others. Current UK track &amp; trace ""Too little, late"" 'Looking mates' way much socialist concepts mainstream American society embrace. time he's points summarised news articles even started speaking might well stay home rest life school districts remote supplying chrome books? 

In Germany answer question 'what school ever that?'. Certainly state funded ones. debate also effectivity kind tests, need probably tests get accurate numbers.

also: today second day testing, number go second round next weekend well. Boris co British publics interests mind.... That’s one approach. I’d like see effort culture shift. would unacceptable someone step onto bus yell racist abuse passenger, rest passengers would step immediately. would outrage. needs done masks. (And don’t start ‘exceptions’ argument. don’t buy - people don’t wear masks don’t care) Honestly admit huge order pantry items. several billion dollar companies publicly admitting problems supply chain. I've found several things missing shelves multiple times last month, prices still higher lot products. So, stocked case got worse. arent shortages least I'm prestocked quarantining around thanksgiving time. Vic cottoned people getting tested afford miss work, started offering payment offset lost wages people isolate, probably made big difference mean way trump denounce psychos tried run biden road? Comparing social movement disease incredible failure analytical logic. 

I hear point, dangerous, overly compromising anti-science, advocate public square hard can. 

My compassion stands nurses dead. Someone's drinking Murdoch kool-aid hahaha. gullible you? Yes, obviously. month homeschooling great, much preferable. Welp start opening public gatherings schools right pieces went up... Maybe that's hint?

We know highly infectious good reason kids spread well adults Even kids die less it.  rare? 
I’m SoCal 100% go people wear it. Despite say country get win like Victoria (Australia) unless levels Government working together. Fed Gov gave generous jobkeeper helped. lock little political bickering.

So no, think Fed state governments fine. perfect, better anywhere else Western world. hope one folks pass asshole people problem, people common sense. live? Leeds streets busy, especially en route local parks dumb. Either let boys play cancel season. thing get 2500 positives everyday normal testing cant get 25k cases everyday cause would duplicating interesting approach. goes well see countries following. may expensive expensive lockdown. *Laughs Dutch* Cummins human like rest us - fallible. can’t go life expecting perfection top. point need grow take responsibility ourselves. Anyone defers responsibility onto others needs grow up. Yes Cummins affair mess, people need stop whining. don’t want keep repeating myself. matter many times say “tough shit” mentality you’re sticking isn’t acceptable restrictions causing real harm people’s lives. isn’t inconveniencing people don’t feel like wearing mask inside Safeway want go bar-hopping - serious repercussions harming people tough shit attitude void empathy short-sighted. you’re sticking it, clearly nothings going change that. can’t teach compassion. 

I’m glad people didn’t “accept things way are” like important turning points history like French Revolution civil rights movement. God knows we’d at. part tourism pitch? Multivitamins cost pennies per day. must salad burger. English, googled barnard castle looks like cool place see.

But what’s joke, google didn’t help all.. ban next? Fox hunting? aristocracy stand that! know survival rate high? haven’t begun triage patients. Right now, everyone needs ventilation/therapeutics getting it. know 20% cases require type hospitalization ~2 weeks, happens mortality rate patients begin lose care require live? Well tell you, survival rate goes down, fast. 

Go check post history, I’ve posted argument 240 days ago. issue virus never high mortality rate. issue time hospital required 20% cases. Eventually begin triage, people die. think 2nd wave Spanish flu deadly comparison 1st? It’s ran medical care people left streets die couldn’t keep up.

Hospitals already run max capacity year round, going 2nd wave first time flu season sign slowing down, absolutely plan. point anyone say taking vitamin prevent getting Covid. 99% information relates preventing death severe outcomes.  political there, thing would contained already. economic cost, even direct payments businesses cover wages home workers, would fraction deep depression that’s coming due mismanagement, things fail thanks mismanagement, like casinos nations. No. actually love need physically see talk them. 

And no, ""get it"" day anyways. Kind like get tuberculosis measles. Wtf malicious attitude. anybody favor infecting them, buddy. Definitely! needs harder enforcement rules. Yea seriously. I'm fucking tired sub. Pretty much really issue probably cell immunity. vaccines. Accept it. Vaccination coming sooner think whether like not. Unfortunately... United States adds new coronavirus case every second, hospitals West Texas Wisconsin overwhelmed soaring number critically ill many cases, it’s lack hospital beds, therapies equipment worry managersamid surge, 229,000 deaths COVID-19 U.S. It’s depleted exhausted hospitals staffs needed care need life-sustaining therapies. Thank sharing this, gave hope alone experience. chronically ill/disabled wounds abusive parents; left university getting started white collar career. disability left pandering meaning left world.

Tb0x, nobody accusing wanting infect others. 

That said...

After immunity, unlikely get bad case, even immunity, people silently carry infectiions shed viruses spread even they're showing symptoms. Common knowledge certain viruses. 

Who knows COVID, known disease spreads asymptomatically first infection.

It's worth somewhat cautious. time, Boris, time... part may wanting risk going testing place since vulnerable. mean me? lie say said reinfection going happen everyone never said that? data perfectly line said. paper line two papers cited discussion. paper says 8% infected individuals sufficient antibodies fight disease 5 months. 8% huge number people could possibly reinfected. currently confirmed infected US, 733,000 potential reinfections (and growing daily). But, guess push narrative rather look science actually says, there's really point even discussing it. making wild assumptions based one legitimate question there. Thank much help world! Putting good vibrations universe returns good vibrations you! gatherings allowed? love talking this. needs much larger part conversation. ? literally can't? Welcome Fourth Amendment.

It's mind-boggling people rabidly anti-police, demand legislation gives freedom defy police, refuse cooperate police approached almost always people think police using state pandemic justify literally invading private property - usually without adhering already-established constitutional policies - hauling people jail for...hosting people. 

Pick side. Either police racist, violent, overstepping jackboots need much less authority interfere peoples' lives tyrannical force enter home arrest party 10. can't ways. Exactly. weird let people breathe you. Like people masks weird ones scenario. like one took science. multiply kids pets businesses Canada tap pin pads, don’t actually need touch it, card/phone tap works without direct contact.

However, Walmart’s use machines tap. also restaurants force touch buttons asking tip requires touching complete payment.  Corona + flu? yikes There's going 330 mil people anymore guys get together Fair enough use French, readable, makes lot contextual mistakes. Lol wtf talking Thanks appreciate it. hope do, too, back you!

Teaching year fucking miserable. even virus, constantly shit every single direction. We're going major teacher shortage soon, many us burnt completely fuck out. Life always matters. 44 still matter. deserve die could gave handled virus better. Yea American claim lost countrymen help home? /s Im sorry hear this. Im still trying figure correlation summer deaths Texas/FL, etc ramped up.... family somewhat fortunate secure burial plot. virus ravaging Indonesia, densely populated capital running space bury dead. Sure why? Even back realized trying protect healthcare workers far important.

We need ask people figure part out. Yes. mask. socially distanced people live with. 😷 Vaccines mass produced months already build stockpile ready go moment approval gotten.

It's quite possible thousands doses day approval.

That meant everyone get once, key populations will. Lockdown, when? theoretical chance vaccine ready mid-December would stupid work assumption. vaccine ready, damage done. ready havent prepared it, even time wasted. Yes keep eating Fox News poopaganda Also Oz 16m people whereas Europe around 650m people many many governments. simply can't compare Oz Europe. One thing you’ll realize relationships fights aren’t worth having. everybody stressed right now, ignoring things like may vital health relationships not. especially considering last winter pretty mild im (us).

short term pain long term gains problem time, antibodies previous infected people wear cause get infected again. but, freedom tho... support support now. mean think could gotten enough compliance without military enforcement back Trump dipshit, pipe dream. doesn’t make sense, could get both. complain you’re accused moron say moronic stuff like it’s wonder. I’ve already man it’s picnic. haven’t able see Mum Nan (who probably doesn’t long left) almost 10 months people like prolonging whole affair. 

You one you, think others change rather crying can’t go pub baby. think accurate reesson recent experience epidemics recentish past. Two simple examples SARS MERS.

Go look South Korea response MERS, bad. virus got hand became difficult contain. 

But also learning moment country. took learned MERS, scaled one best test, trace isolate regiemes there. extrovert complete shitstain. Wow. mess! Thank posting experience.  hope districts learn implement what’s working experience. Meanwhile wet markets operating 100% making sure another corona virus soon don’t want Russians sick either. see people without masks since became mandatory public indoor places. whining foggy glasses still ongoing though around 70% asymptomatic carriers get caught test Yoo, someone covid recovered never thought someone would act like I'm bad person life bit less stressful since can't get/transmit virus.

Shit makes sense would love test coughs. Texas. know districts structured disciplined. telling experience. don’t work school, I’ve kid district 14 years know many teachers/admins hear them. It’s perfect staff think it’s hoax, follow rules seems working.  oddballs like Hungarian Finnish

Can confirm. Source: speak oddball (Finnish) going read giant cookies message came couldn’t press ok button screen. hate internet days need visit? 

Asian countries followed rules lenient. also contained virus much faster larger cities brilliant track trace.

I truly don’t get people like can’t see, could completely wipe covid spent 2 months inside following rules.

Instead want fight rules, making drag yes that, believe not, rules get TIGHTER. go longer! 

Would rather see grandmother 2 months, 5 years (which long predict take us people like continue ignore rules)

Why people world incapable seeing bigger picture. blows mind dissapointed bud strains Coronavirus family (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 aka COVID-19.) Scientists started develop vaccine original SARS-CoV funding research cut pandemic petered out. 

So yeah people talk vaccine “rushed” it’s actually works like decade. Australia also closed internal state borders contain outbreaks/protect clean states too. real? seems like he’s done everything within power. house Salt Lake. article Saint George. yes, we're bat shit crazy Utah. Compared ""old guy tried destabilise US win election"" pretty good news. Haha yeah get this. Funny thing went visit china charged foreigner ticket prices even though like ""I'm taiwan"" lmao hella confused well.

I get advantages disadvantages chinese citizens, I'm going say no. get question coming though, unfortunately think there's easy answer that. plenty blame go around. Pfizer completed enrollment later Moderna, (Oct 27th) neither company completed vaccinating enrolled participants. 2-3 weeks pipe dream approval imho mostly eliminated country. cases coming returned travelers, quarantine. Unless escapes good chance little local transmission. county red even though according state doh death since 9/25. I'm sure accurate map part ""I'v training whole life"" exactly said before. extremely difficulty living OCD pandemic. definitely should. Honestly really wish give date begin with, order prevent everybody accusing government ""shifting goalposts"", even though unpredictable situation. 

The lockdown also last beyond Christmas, people become eager exit lockdown they'll end huger celebrations normal, end spreading virus. virus take days holidays. such, ""lockdown save Christmas"" idea completely bullshit. 

The problem that, however, they've already given dates, already pushed ""lockdown save Christmas"" idea hard, will, again, lead *lots* rule-breaking misguided accusations ""goalpost shifting"". literally went paper day discussion... titer required neutralization. caught reference mr. Kotleba Woke looking snap stories friends large parties. one cares anymore. least people age range. Bunch narcissists. get sucks can’t normal things, wish people actually concerned others themselves.. sadly, they’ll start caring someone know affected. Hope doesn’t come Doubtful Mass protests like countries. people world wide like told do. leader? Hahah hahah hahahah Well, introduces concepts become important later on. Even ""dealing large numbers"" basic concepts probability would benefit people greatly. natural intuition begin understand things super helpful population level, even people can't explicitly write paper. doesn’t mean wouldn’t work Trump administration gave chance. Instead Trump started listening radiologist(completely different specialty) said flattering things early pandemic, even appointed White House advisor. transparently self serving attack Fauci attempt ruin credibility. time least afford it. Pa-thetic statistics updates Netherlands? I’m completely alright it’s faster there. completely term us copycats simply ignorance point, Doctor Scapegoat sacrificial lamb. Scary times Fauchmeister says lots things, diametrically conflict past statements. Like Narcissus, man loves looking reflection TV, I'd imagine he'll continue say things keep image front him. game Tories, great time playing too. would duplicates? Positive cases would go quarantine, wont going test again. weird got aunt uncle didn’t. No. Nobody knows flu seasonal. also assumes things weather true lot places. far likely huddled together inside July January Texas, winter still flu season. minimal. Wait.... think theres magical tool detects every new case across world? called tests goof. get new cases numbers hospital state testing. CDC reported actual infected 6-24x 'new cases' numbers lack testing people sick giving shit taking test. testing simple free places new cases number going sky rocket reporting free testing. risk partners told weeks ago list early December vaccines trials finish expected. 

It’s fantastic news correct, ease restrictions small potion population vaccine, risk COVID high worry long term vaccine issues literally saw old person knew high school Trump Rally yesterday took video snap chat one person wearing mask, it’s like don’t even hide lmao Pfizer expecting done 2 (3?) weeks, Moderna oxford December yeah I’m wrong still enough time knock sucker spring especially vaccinate everyone risk health care workers ...Dan Cortez Good you. fly family emergency. looking forward it. Eating balanced diet general impossible people. Sitting window sun hitting even 15 minutes day asking much. opposite. 

The White House needs get real. Can’t say: immunity while, except people reinfection ? believe Canada also started vaccine review time EU Third? looks like second. think Slovakia Proof Concept bigger countries take know us. Maybe near future see kind testing worst affected areas - big cities followed whole countries. type businesses talking about? like shops closed? can’t understand that’s issue. support says everything deciding let everyone know reason tells us you’re supporting. need million cases day minimum. Quickly achieve herd immunity dance Village People. /S wife's family Slovak. family friends ""went honeymoon"" 1968 (they lived Czechoslovakia). still return 1990. know 8% antibodies didn’t provide enough protection? Oh cool! New Yorkers decide make run go states? Oh yeah, count.

Thanks, Cuomo. Keep LaGuardia open outbound flights!  None trials even done next 4 weeks. might preliminary data doubt approve new platform preliminary data alone. hope 70%, think that’s close enough don’t know effective yet. Fauci already stated first generation vaccine may great. [actual study Consistent data human coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-1 Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV (17), also find stable antibody titers period least 3 months modest declines 5-month time point. plan follow cohort longer intervals time. Although cannot provide conclusive evidence antibody responses protect reinfection, believe likely decrease odds ratio reinfection, may attenuate disease case breakthrough infection. believe imperative swiftly perform studies investigate establish correlate protection infection SARS-CoV-2.

So, bit middle ground mass reinfection one-and-done COVID, pending study. 100% disagree 733k potential reinfections

Then disagreeing results study. least leftists following campaign buses nearly hour trying ram caravan road opinion; Dr Fauci needs get real direct people. message must told, matter cost (finicial, personal political) Luckily people, media organizations back. many lives stake including health safety medical workers.This moment time epitome entire career ""Whole lot hurt"" sure. hindsight, many us thinking acting like wild animals 9/11 slippery slope trust reporter nowadays. order fact check, one needs research source themselves.

Good public health mass testing. Although, believe golden standard still PCR-RT. [Michael Gove warns new lockdown UK might extended past December 

You know, *should*! mean, four weeks pretty unrealistic deadline begin with. seriously consider extending Christmas well; know now, virus *not* take holidays (see also response comment Halloween downthread), least public health standpoint, ""lockdown save Christmas"" idea amounts little bigger utter bunk. Oh sure. fully aware cold chain immense challenge getting vaccine around single country, mention entire world.

Pretty pathetic. news, White House led fucking moron hired hundreds fucking morons function mouthpiece. Actually Americans pretty large personal space bubble compared certain European countries less touchy feeley, that’s probably part Spain France badly No, Fauci also 40+ years experience infectious diseases. He’s correct virus pretty much everything said minus mask comment beginning. Nobody perfect. Apparently take child school register (to avoid bullshit fine) homeschool school accept back choose reintegrate school system May rest peace.

Seeing fifty years made staunch socialist. anti mask start, means shouldn’t trust him? trump still anti mask denies basic science that’s okay? realized seriousness virus changed opinion accordingly. exact opposite conclusion yet are. mental gymnastics people wild suddenly last place US Canada without big outbreak Atlantic provinces. Also, streets busy walk crowd definitely wear mask better Trump pretty damn low bar. That's really standard hold experts to? Developing countries often pretty robust infrastructure past nation-wide vaccination programs entire population reach even remotest places (polio example).  Trumptarded United States better.

That's fighting. virus restrictions seen totally disproportionate actual impact virus.

The actual human loss relevant human loss. America accusing country cold war. Made laugh.

Who cares believe not. 

It's you. 

Get yourself. people top wanted nothing all. dont know thats chart reads. Ya thought same... lockdowns created equal. Canada first lockdown backyard, parks, hiking walking, going drives quiet beaches, etc. France leave house 1hr leisure time must within 1km residence. best believe backyard porch Paris apartment. ethical perspective totally get saying -- page recently. 

There's lot fucks think covid big deal -- honestly we're going able convince them. want go get covid picking supplies -- I'm morally okay that. tried _so damn hard_ get people listen think -- I'm done concerning safety point. 

Beyond - even assume people working instacart/etc anti-covid folks -- reducing amount people running errands reduce overall threat landscape. single person shopping prevents 3-4 people going store, that's net win. 

If run N95s, source KN95s ebay days -- effectively filtration, less ideal heat fittings. man least somewhat decent one. thats cool. Throw Fauci bus letting Atlas [go (literally Russian state media) argue lockdowns restrictions. 

Completely beyond parody. could made medical masks ""vital medical supply"" making crime resell masks people pharmacies companies sold pandemic.

And made crime hoard medical grade masks - 100 masks per family member.

Even laws unenforcable would gone message masks important valuable out. evidence statement complete dogshit. 

I asked evidence political nonsense statement, since report mine criticism removed. statement complete dogshit. That’s got removed mod.

No got removed rude reported it, moderators ton time look every debate gets Qatar study. wanted see see could get reinfected CARRIER, even symptomatic covid, rate reinfection 0.01 percent. HIGH DOSAGE exposure. there. You’re wrong. Objectively. Argument over. 

So one study Qatar literally proved reinfection. Wow, arguments place. also didn’t abandon safety measures. Stop lying. made up, like everything else said. fact, still social distance wear mask.

I say abandoning safety measures, said deserting safety measures. said infect people anymore, although say know long would last you. fact, still social distance wear mask.

Good, exact reaction aiming way, initial comment saying SERIOUS OCD able worry getting transmitting virus healthy mental health.

Just shows said untrue serious OCD, able reply still trying prove stance, stunned.

Be stunned then. sit spread misinformation, saying everyone got infected pandemic would over. 

Virus mutates exact reason dependent eluding immunity host. virus keep coming back, like coronaviruses, stop spreading misinformation able catch it. 

There consensus anybody still get reinfected separate strains one originally caught, safe take care others. 

And hope nice day. Masks preventative viral spread new information... Plenty Americans supposed to. many US leaders 20-30% people opposite.

In Australia, Premier agreed pass laws supports required, police ticketed people flouted new rules. Big difference. Mandatory strong word happens places. shops dont give shit super markets seem let people without mask weak excuse. live near restaurants PACKED every time past. One actually big plastic tent outside also packed there's real spacing tables. Also, town centre busy hell hardly anyone wears mask, people walk around big groups lots people stand around vaping smoking. wonder high risk, full idiots Finland Slovenia smack dab middle second wave.

As Australia back August. 

The point Greece, Finland Slovenia EXACTLY Australia start - lockdown early, close borders, trace, wait out. Finland even went proper lockdown way still emerged relatively unscathed around 300 deaths first wave. Greece even better around 150 deaths country 10 million one highest median ages world. even spike summer managed get back control - could even say performed better Victoria.

But could afford keep borders closed indefinitely. reopen point, got hit second wave cannot control effectively Australia could. basically confirmed point. honest dont think choice avoiding it...but yes well. stay safe. mean.. thing America lol police corrupt matter Sweeden tried this, economy tanked worse still recovered. Also get multiple times antibodies last months. Also antibodies one worst parts. Well let’s see since admitted wrong changed course. He’s spewing lies like president rest predictions spot on. Fauci said would see 100,000 cases day past week happened. People called crazy said it. Science established hand washing either, since new virus. believe held too? Trump awful irrelevant. Tell people wear masks pandemic I'm going trust you. Stores insurance allow handwave away protesting peaceful whereas looting violence done rioters terrorists. Absolutely not. trust police even less trust people don’t wear masks Probably another first world nation get turned away PhD speak French. Yes posted times now, happened 2 days ago keep winning. am, quite frankly, sick winning... especially looks like. Finally accurate timeframes, thanks far ""real"" academic interviews compared appearances network television. also talk ""why"" horrible position. could certainly ""real"". would love hear explain advised US vs actually timeline form. Biden totally wholesome trump stoking flames pretty hard. Anybody goes RT thinking they're going spread agenda fool. asked appear Russian state agenda. 
prnewswire paid press release conduit. news site. Basically pure advertising. Ok Hitler lol First all, “we”? write publish article? apologies. American, enough trouble believing politically driven news comes mouths American news agencies, especially regarding virus. little trust news outlets situated Russia China. Two countries perpetually stuck cold war. European countries also did. Interregional travel Italy banned 3 months straight.

Again, temporary measure, still easier enforce Australia relatively isolated metropolitan areas clearly separated pretty much nothing between, save densely populated stretch along southwestern coast. Things make money already money get priority :) Helped Trump, efforts cut red tape bureaucracy, billions approved pushed motion. Ah man, must really suck take time day make comment like that. Wth talking about. Greece, Finland Slovenia smack dab middle second wave. Slovenia Greece wayyyyy worse first wave control.

Australia basically zero cases compared guys, completely shut second wave. Yep. Im communication half family. old co morbid life matter them, really benefit them, I?  Q told think good idea trust people who've lied recent past? surprising? 

Part population willfully ignores risks attempt flaunt defiance mortality. way suppress mortality.

The get locked down, people actually defy rules deep within want believe live forever.

The party becomes transference symbol sort, thing lifts threshold death continued existence. party party life, celebration life defiance death itself.

Very people ever get it, word way. Mostly hear say things like: 'I wanna live life without fear.' reason given: '...and bad economy.' Things like that.

But underneath fear death creeps consciousness time pandemic, fear existential needs alleviated, ameliorated. hence parties blatant disregard mortality another. hard find balance restricting freedom public safety. mind lockdown. However, pretty much feel like we'll lockdowns freedome till get vaccine. way we'll able keep untill then. 

I wish people going parties etc would give shit. Police break illegal parties like every day. Hmm, right..damn. Nothing like intersecting pandemic borders stir pot. difficulties recommended ranges different people different needs also us absorb necessary vitamins equally... example vitamin C helps iron absorbtion, calcium inhibits it. Loads complex relationships. That’s iron tablets 100mg even though ranges normal levels normally 15-20mg... goal flood body absorb let sort can’t absorb. 
A lot people whine vitamins expensive things pee tbh kind goal good news. Trump ability fire directly. That's exactly already refusing go along delusions. pretty much state borders Australia closed other. 

AFAIK interstate borders Victoria NSW got closed July (since previous wave ended course). kind localised lockdown also several areas Europe did, e.g., Spain Madrid. think plan keep interstate borders closed indefinitely vaccine comes, you? ad interim measure outbreak Melbourne would get control again. again! need mask “lie” back March/April protect supply masks healthcare workers. time mask supply scarce point US government seizing supplies, masks, etc. going anywhere healthcare organizations. needed done time doctors nurses treating sick would become ill died causing bigger issue. Study sponsored company who’s trying sell product. peer reviewed data, insight methodology. Garbage post. That's already happening hospital. One ""nursing assistants"" day physical therapist enough CNAs go around. nurse-to-patient ratios increased, we're crisis charting (bare minimum), told many words keep people alive. Hospitals much customer-service based, tell us nurses worry getting cups ice warm blankets patients drastic change illustrates dire situation becoming. press release product sale, yes. data backing claim unlike many similar products. would human social norms shaped Abrahamic faith last 5000 years evolutionary trait?  Sounds great paper. happening anywhere? unsophisticated thinker. thoughts Santa Claus? Base reading appear really enforced. Sure business closed public movement restriction really enforced. guess someone can't even civil would okay deception. mean KGB? Dark days. Slovakian here.
Around 1 mil citizens tested 12pm,which means within first 4-5 hours testing.

For reason, population testing. Many people think corona hoax either doesnt exist serious flu, unfortunately. wrong, there's way many hoaxes spread facebook people believe without research.

I disagree, IMO certainly needed. research know needs taken seriously. glad done.

Second round testing done week. yet.  Song day: Lunatics Taken Asylum"" Hush, allowed bring facts sub. Breathonix uses PTR-MS Breathomix uses Metal Oxide Semiconductor sensors. naming similar, overall technology different. machine learning + instrument basically every -omics company. PTR-MS MOS used various research groups companies analyze exhaled breath. r/title gorge   Dutch company deployed soon, basically testing phase made ready deployment waiting approval. already tested real world scenarios testing site Amsterdam, 1800 people got tested.

It also got tested hospital trial that. government company said test give certainty negative lot cases (means basically false negatives, danger here). test Singapore done 1 small clinical trial 180 people, they're certainly still process testing right?

Now article mentioned, cited source incorrectly. They're talking specificity 75%, mean 75% people line test received breathalyzer test tested negative certainty. 2 weeks ago positivity rate Amsterdam around 20%. let's say 100 people, 80 negative, those, test managed filter 75 cases. That's 75% specificity negative result, 75/80 = 94% case. goal test find positive, filter people negative.

Edit: seems like Singapore test done small clinical trial, reached large trial public locations. Dutch test seems done weeks ago deployed soon massive scale Netherlands.  forgot table-salt baths. &amp;#x200B;

Hopefully won’t get downvoted this, anyone explain think good explanation? understanding (and feel free correct I’m wrong), N95 masks public able obtain via hardware stores *not* medical grade, supply chains locations provided masks public supply chains provided masks medical establishments different. 

So medical establishments couldn’t use masks public access to, public couldn’t get access masks medical establishments used...how would panic-buying public lead shortage medical establishment? 

Going further, since FEMA federal government (apparently) ability seize supplies (like spring), public try hoard over-buy medical-grade masks, wouldn’t federal government re-route supplies medical establishments instead commercial retailers? Or, like one guy Tennessee hoarded tried price-gouge hand sanitizer, seize supplies people trying masks? dailymail.co.uk may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

The Singapore version also tested specialised hospital meant Covid patients 95% specificity. higher 75% mentioned, mention they're conducting tests. I'm sure difference means thing appear nowhere

The Singapore company founded Covid, September 2019. university research spin-off company, fly-by-night operation. validations inducing CDC/FDA. google it. Yes, part team. He's best bad lot. moment heard mask advice last spring knew needed listen experts *different country*.     
I think Fauci wrong since mask fiasco. stuff late. late masks, late aerosols. hear things like ""infectious dose"" whisper. Take multi-vitamin, god forbid.  experts countries, countries much better results we're seeing here. Here's article [last discussing Austria requiring mask wearing big mistake US Europe, opinion, people aren’t wearing masks,” George Gao Fu, director general Chinese Center Disease Control Prevention (CDC), said.
“This virus transmitted droplets close contact. Droplets play important role – you’ve got wear mask, speak, always droplets coming mouth.”

Yeah, right Chinese guy. Said last March. read last March, decided guy makes sense. clear people like selfish give shit anyone else necessary collect PPE front line workers federal government managing epidemic poorly important make sure protection first Brother law tested PCR positive, asymptomatic whole way through, stayed home sister 15 month old son and, fucking morons, never isolated one another ""it's better catch get with.""

(Actually, somewhat consternation public health experts, they're saying expect *have* EUA end November.)

Pfizer, Astra-Zeneca, Johnson &amp; Johnson far behind. expect we'll multiple EUA applications end year. Funny asked that. conversation 2 best friends day. One moved state said wasn’t coming home holidays questioned due pandemic. response “lmao I’m worried more. friend got symptoms. affects old fat people, it’s flu marketing campaign worry full category.”

The response disgusted there’s point arguing. haven’t seen 2 friends especially one saying he’s voting trump. won’t end friendship it, it’s truly disturbing makes question I’d want hang someone mindset. Fortunately I’m petty avoid types convos moving forward. think keep retail open strict capacity limits mask mandates. Clothes diy stuff bunch things essential, there's lot essential you, essential somebody reason can't relate to

That said safe mask mandates come fines guidelines acceptable masks. cloth wraps. chin diapers. external vents. ded. that's different reason. flu mutates quickly, antibodies useless met mutated viruses. actually is.

Sure, perceived norm, Governor talking ass? remember Coumo throwing fit spring Rhode Island wanted institute similar policy. Wearing masks seems becoming norm, see business travelers taking test upon arrival quarantining 3 14 days. That's lot friction wasted time. Similarly tourists, think tourists touristing right now, there. 

This seems like type policy honored breech. example, highly doubt media figures professional athletes, whose travels state easily tracked observed quarantining three days upon arrival back NY. ""Rules"" case officious requests without consequences clearly apply hoi polloi exists class(es) people clearly cannot comply requirements perfect examples create disrespect government. I'd love see Giants SNL guests, studio media guest publicly shamed air, practicing within 72 hours arrival NY. seem likely. Ya like maybe WW2 Considering question based sixth form, home schooling would absolutely fine me, especially home situation good WiFi connections seperate study room deserve beer cheer! Rate decrease stabilization (which we're reaching now) hopefully decrease eventually. right, even worse Slovakia tested half country day, Czech Republic.

But also, that's chart DEATHS, cases. necessary past Good. way ends enough people businesses stop complying. I'm actually child situation, school measures hand sanitiser far, I'm really uneasy going 90+% overall hospitalizations (and deaths) people 70

These entire numbers COVID sure. exactly this! JK payment available? That’s one subsidy found validation SD biosensor (I think used here) specificity 99.7%. Bratislava, 717 people tested positive 230670 (0.31%). Given specificity possible, even likely, false positive. You’re comparing covid cancer fucking moron holy shit 😂😂 Sure. that's sort point.

You army people working insane hours logistics expect use supply chain they're building soon. think we'd vaccine get EUA February, relative would able get sleep. 

If relative armed forces? know person charge logistics 4-star general. (The military knows things logistics - say, army travels stomach.) think would better putting written statement every days concise observations public health recomendations. Meanwhile, Kansas positivity rate 27% last time checked. people going life normal. think metro areas ok least people wearing masks, rural areas numbers going exponentially add rural counties vs metro area counties, rural areas many, cases.

Oh, woke today chills terrible headache. cough temp 99 degrees. I'm bit worried, even though really anywhere wear mask everywhere go. Border closure racist. I've exactly experience T, literally mum asthmatic too, things going school still mandatory masks even though there's 1800 us, year groups 1 sent home. safe enough protect mum nan anymore Hague pretty stable amount new cases last couple weeks, really see lot action taken companies/people, I'm pretty surprised stable. Maybe due holidays.

It seemed like people really took seriously couple days partial lockdown, week later seemed forgotten. Almost measures supermarket, much lower mask usage (days partial lockdown lots people wearing masks). guess neighbourhood filled people short term memory haha. certainly is. suggest keep mind Slovak people top list foreign languages want even need learn. Maybe certain someone didn’t systemically erode trust federal government individual states wouldn’t independently review safety. totals, worldometer says #3 #4th rigtht now, unless meant something else. truly shame. one state lockdowns last 3 months NorCal things bad atm feeling guilty cuz distanced mask wearing visit 4 friends seen year. I've seen parents 2x otherwise I'm staying home 28+ days month. really sad many people convinced pandemic big deal. Thought fascinating rational discussion. American media refuses allow politically inconvenient arguments, blame going elsewhere? hilarious irony many left used (and actual lefties still do) like RT. tested half country day. Spain Italy that, course would peak. Lol duh. Bc becoming head dept Stanford student there? became head due accomplishments within field. Yet still get common cold flu. Like what, ""you arrest contracting transmittable disease""???? Well done Australia! going make money this? 

You know, one Western economies Covid-19 control, stable democracy boot - make us tasty safe investment? 

I know New Zealand already beat us it. well countries. top 10 something. deserve money? use knuckles. good stick, seems safer fingertip. may case are, would encourage double check actual data lot people assume Scotland it’s true. 

There vocal minority shouting Great Barrington Declaration “shield vulnerable” fact 45 don’t realise vulnerable. might die normally, triaging based oxygen availability might different story. 

For Scotland, talking thread 45 - 64 age group seen hospitalisations throughout whole thing. choose “In Total” drop see hospitalisations. Cool, thanks pedantic Thats testing werent testing they’d zero cases Yes. many freedom important safety. Even short term. overwhelmed, could end happening?

Things getting rough Pennsyltucky fall Every one us safe country thankful yes frustrating watch countries fail badly. No. Ironically, skeptics believe conspiracy theories accuse everyone else critical thinking skills believing everything media outlets say.

We also teach children differentiate different kinds sources variable credibility, properly evaluate likelihood conspiracy theories real. gotta pull bit mate compare country shirshow others going atm.

Id rather guys almost 6 months straight lockdown, try get virus 700 cases 0 (Melbourne, australia) biggest worries lockdown? 

Is fear coming mental health perspective, economy concerns, concerns? understandable reasons, obviously, given government assistance everyone homelessness isn’t factor, fears originating? Canada’s goal try get regulatory process done close time final trials done. would mean would little time final trial regulatory approval whereas regularly regulatory approval wouldn’t start trials concluded. work? would cool did, still budget time “ if” scenarios That’s Patty Hearst level dedication House Mouse doubled number beds way, once. can't keep doubling number every week. Covid19 ***can*** keep doubling every week. Yep. animal training learn positive reinforcement better producing desired behavior negative reinforcement/punishment. think health officials understandably freaking think counter ""covid going away"" message ""you killing neighbors wtf people"". think empathetic ""I know hard I'm sorry going I'm proud people country hard work staying home wearing mask..."" would go lot farther. 

I also think need think social side ""social distancing"". Im single live alone unemployed since April. I've seeing immediate family week. point much likely infect vice versa. stay fully isolated almost year, think point would killed incredibly deep depression. Telling people ""don't see humans unknown number months/years"" completely goes human nature. Guys, else think pay executives pre-Covid salaries??? Disney took PPP money tax payers get back money plus interest. 

So hand if/when do. 

But don’t want real conversation. want bellyache. Mods deleting comments. 

How questioning validity coronavirus policy wrt constitutionality “purely political”? various trump critiques “purely political”?

And factually calling failed policy sending elderly covid patients back assisted living homes led deaths incivility?

Do teach critical reasoning Reddit mod u? see C19 causes robust immune response triggers Cells durable B Cells. 

While thing sterilizing immunity antibodies, suppress virus lessen symptoms. 

Even virus sticks around long time (very possible, probable really) likely immune suppressed endemic disease since people exposed infection vaccination. 

This virus bad right novel. one exposed it. Many experts believe OC43 caused Russian Flu Epidemic now, mislabeled flu. Killed million+, aggressive virus first crossed humans. circulates mild coronavirus. mean temporary restrictions freedom emergencies worked democratic countries relatively high levels freedom (rations curfews UK WWII NZ, year) lot countries I'd rather emulate China model... Haha, right. great people low vitamin absorption.

Also, else going get vitamin we're cooped locked down? Governor says covid fear mongering Fox News places lol Ok 5 months, right? Sorry writing rabbit hole Disney *bad*

You're spot politics. lot things complicated life. Science science needs sure thinks ""right"". Well that's least one reason. Politics complicated many different opinions needs. higher go (city level county/district level state level federal level international level) harder becomes find proper balance compromise. Add countries statesmen defend stance costs welcome world. 

Not mention lobbying undoubtedly happening bend politics favor corporations. 

To play devil's advocate ""average Joe"", day 24 hours, need sleep, work eat, probably family old enough, where's time energy get complicated matters like politics science? indeed way easier feel better stick one media outlet skim headlines smaller articles. 

I know digress hard now, upon writing text remembered following graph found site know graph comes regard every statistic find internet correct, nevertheless find interesting ""making money"" apparently become much important ""developing meaningful philosophy life"". I'm old enough judge myself. 

I'm glad made leap college managed get better world view (sorry sounds weird, know say better). College let's develop naturally think decide want achieve. Set priorities. 

I really wish anyone would get chance higher education everybody needs college degree everybody needs critical thinking skills mentioned. going write paper pass class without critical thinking careful collecting sources? enough use Wikipedia Fox News (""Bild"" would probably equivalent Germany). 

However, feels like everything around humans developing faster humanity itself. Technology, ability communicate person around planet, ability go anywhere trade anyone world. Humans can't seem keep that. least everyone. Edgar Morin says book ""seven complex lessons education future"" able talk anyone world without waiting, farther away actually understanding person side world. wrote book many years ago...it probably gotten better since then. 

After University many years started liking languages. Like, hated language subjects like German, English, French etc. science guy true science guy needed hate subjects cool (see, goes ways). I've enjoying learning French last years also want work mother tongue (not German) well, guess need know mother tongue. feels right. 

Anyways, wall text. Good luck hope find success deserve able make world better place.

Let's overflow hospitals kill thousands people covid illnesses can't treated overburdened hospitals.


'Anti-lockdown' people need grow-up get priorities. much much bigger population.

Are trying say US bigger population EU? husband high blood pressure? Unfortunately, cosmetology/makeup school, there's really way it. can't get hours without completing courses properly. They're even close richest. research saying stupid shit. people get Covid, go hospital, die hospital. That's covid death. 

Some get Covid, knocked week two, ultimately kick covid virus. longer covid patient, may lasting heart palpitations, poor blood flow, respiratory complications, etc ultimately succumb to. That's covid related complication I’d love see Colorado. went CareNow centre got PCR test said they’d get day test Oct. 1st. think it’d huge help, I’m worried won’t prevent another shut down. Masks prevent worn here, definitely lot nose etc.

I hope possibly required temp checks ANYTHING avoid shutdown There's also risk long term covid complications even unlikely die. trade probably worth it. Thursday one able order home test again: oil. Maybe true, also comparing countries EU 10x population density US. I'm pretty sure something it. definetely helped. Couple family members around city, me, tested positive, symptoms, maybe cough. One member works totally home weeks, met family one hour weekend.

Without testing, everybody would go tomorrow work on. many issues, unhappy people, different opinions result help. need stay quarantine 10+ days happy spread covid become positive. entering second wave without lull first.
This like taking large pan, filling water sloshing around one side other.
The wave never subsided, matter gang momentum, like tsunami turning back opposite side more.

Americans general greedy, selfish severe issues instant gratification take make stick adequate mitigation efforts slow progress disease even get first wave. Literally richest company world money god they're laying employees?  


Make make sense. know say can't say more, but- know family member got field work? military? would love work logistics distribution job like I’ll check thanks so? 

I’m side going get worse, better ways treat now. Yes, doesn’t really matter empty beds hospital, exponential growth doesn’t go forever. 

Saw comment saying expect 30k plus cases day sometime December. won’t happen. Considering number tests declining week week, dont think numbers represents true 43 285.277
*week 42 310.716 That's CFR. Case fatality rate. Based confirmed cases. 

The IFR, infection fatality rate based assumed total infections much lower, 0.25%-1% range. actual risk death 1% lower overall. Due testing limitations, especially large outbreaks, cases confirmed skews towards moderate severe cases. testing limited required bad symptoms, sometimes even hospitalization get tested. vast majority asymptomatic mild cases missed periods, driving CFR up. example US depending time pandemic missing anywhere 50%-90% cases times. 

Around 0.5% overall seems current average guess different experts. vary 0.25-1% range. infections occurring 40 group IFR around 0.1%. brings average lot. starts increasing exponentially 70s+ begin hit double digits.

Edit: Also vaccines passed safety standards know. Efficacy what's question. done couple zoom meetings terrible, kept crapping video never sync audio. I'm sure money proper set would work great cant really afford drop ton money Well would logical thing do. Mathematician here. thoroughly completely wrong wrong. American new COVID cases increasing exponentially rate 2% day.

I've read several comments seem pretty full-time side virus. I, personally, support humans.

I'm blocking you. Ive never said anything WW1. Go reread mr. reading comprehension Glad hear take it, conflicts article content. ""These findings indicate noteworthy rate recovered patients COVID-19 could still asymptomatic carriers virus""  Really good point right honorable Boris Johnson Upper East Side Manhattan New York State done probably look state Premiere Victoria Western Australia motive second severe lockdown. r/AustralianPolitics discussion want discuss politics behind lockdown think refuse treatment people believe refusing treatment interesting idea. Think people refused treatment due point view? don’t deserve treatment! fair. 

Also, people weakened immune systems due poor life choices refused, too. Don’t like eating healthy support others? treatment you! Don’t like discomfort making tough choices behalf others? treatment you! 

Don’t like comment? treatment you. needs consequences. strategy. (It might outcome however.) discussed already, response like many others, I.E suppressing virus infections. think best way deal refuse covid patients hospitals. covid patients = hospitals functioning normal. simple. Someone suggest Donald Trump, he’ll love this! need lockdown live life normally. disagree. Live small town NY. enforced several employees, letting back work returning bad state. also think 5-6 people top head traveled self QT getting back I’ve zoom meetings weren’t coming meet person. Many people taking seriously. 

But also know lot aren’t too, neighbor bragged going bad state said fuck Cuomo joke. Sadly she’s retired nurse. ""beyond medical help""

The sad thing going that. triaging resources, gets bad enough, distinct possibility people could saved medical intervention would unable receive due shortages. Triage places resources good. 25 year old conditions acted like idiot get care 50 year old diabetes took every precaution forced work starve circumstance Yeah, okay, claim 200000 plus american died covid, twice many americans died ww1.


And said 400000 died ww1


Now trying say meant people us died covid ww1. That's like 10+ millions people.

So bring 400000 thought meant world wide deaths?

Or changing subject bad claim yours? mindset great. start issues. Spoiler alert: wrote WW2

Great reading comprehension doubling jt brah LA. 9% percent Winnipeg, MB Canada. Starting understand U.S friends feeling crazy high numbers. never know much hurts stub toe Probably problem then!

Yeah, contact something like 1,000 people per case (contacts contacts contacts) need go extent, isolate families colleagues catch most. slowly work contact tracing. neighborhood Halloween limited guess depends live.  meant it. everyone got sick right would two weeks. Yep see thing NW suburbs. Mask compliance good stores saw good number parties last night. Well mean give insides actuall seeing: 
On average normal year months december march people dying 8-10 % years average (thanks cold weather weakens immunsystem) , months may october people die 6-8 % years average. months april november pretty much average. everything would normal year, would sie smooth streched valley year. 
So different bumps start 2017 , february-march 2018 vie shorter uphills middle several years ? 

Well 2017 Cold january Germany (or basically hole europe) thousand people died usual . 

Well smaller uphills middle years 2018,2019 2020 days (or following days) temperature rise 35°Celsius (95 °F). days always deathrate jumps significant (many people would otherwise died days weeks later otherwise )

So biggest bump, 2018 comes deadly influenca/flu season ever Germany. Estimated around 28 000 people died (usually estimated 6000 8000). 
That happend 2-3 reasons. Well extreamly cold Februar lead biggest influenca wave since like 17 years. rare strain influenca viruses dominant one. problem rare virus type , commen way cheaper ""3-times"" vaccine didn`t work ( company usually gives free). people , even risk groups one . expensive ""4-times"" vaccine could prevented would maybe safed 5000 20 000 lifes (no standard). 

Now corona deaths. ""corona wave"" hit march/april death numbers usually dropping. increase deaths flattend anual dropping process looks like ""extended winter"" death rate weeks instead classic ""rising"" wave. Still calculated diffrence deaths 2020 compared average 2016-2019. result get like 7900 . Confirmed dead corona virus time segment 7200.

Sorry bad reading comprehension.


Either way, change claim 400000 died ww1? Airborne aids confirmed believe trying warn government bad going get pressure gov mask mandate. court room, would risk showing ordered so? one Sweden saying herd immunity achieved. really base knowledge clickbait headlines? like others pointed December likely earliest first get highest risk. General public start getting likely spring sometime. wish better luck future. average age like 20 isn’t many 80 year olds pottering around.
I retuned west Africa outside airport malls there’s real effort contain virus. 
But young healthy population without serious health conditions barley makes impact Sometimes anti-maskers hoax patients identify actually get sick go ER. hospital, hospital could deny services since unlikely patients would follow directions anyways. Wearing mask reduces risk, sure, leaving interpretation whether participate large group events. people want push lockdowns banning non-essential events, needs apply everything: political rallies, weddings, protests, sports events, etc.

Otherwise one group say ""protesting important us stay inside"", another group say ""look, get that, also get events"", everyone's whatever want blaming side. Ebola extremely severe lot less difficult contract.

If recall lot people isolated fear contracted ebola 11 actually contracted 2 nurses worked closely patient. Good suggestion, thanks. Hang too. sure. since talk essential travel, I'm also sure point is. outbreak Europe far bigger, thus would necessary remain lockdown far longer 0-5 cases, wasn’t possible economy. Sounds like sugar high. Seems like need ponder said. There's incentive private business offer mass testing services. Time let go.

Well, I'll leave Sounds tough you, hope make ok. I’m board whatever measures R down. pricks don’t follow rules? strategy — aimed allowing exposure virus order build immunity among general population protecting high-risk groups like elderly — controversial. health experts liken playing Russian roulette public now, country’s chief epidemiologist said strategy appears working “herd immunity” could reached capital Stockholm matter “In major parts Sweden, around Stockholm, reached plateau (in new cases) we’re already seeing effect herd immunity weeks’ time we’ll see even effects that. rest country, situation stable,” Dr. Anders Tegnell, chief epidemiologist Sweden’s Public Health Agency, told CNBC Tegnell said sampling modeling data indicated 20% Stockholm’s population already immune virus, “in weeks’ time might reach herd immunity believe we’re seeing slow decline cases, spite sampling (testing coronavirus) more.”

It strategy failed. apologists like deny ever existed. means states US high rates, averaged whole US way people smaller countries would look bad. Per day? know, that's exactly feel too. point, even feel bad morons assholes wipe out, like said, problem affecting many others well. live richest country world. Volunteering nurse exploited.

Either way, thread many tested positive two different states. One smaller population less testing.

Are allowed discuss spread world wide pandemic without somone crying un American?

I know guys care, butI'm sorry AMERICANS dieing. actually like country” sounds unethical impossible install Well TBH impulsively asking volunteer skill-free work local hospital. hasn’t ever happened🤔🤔 ...but have, explain that. ""explain reinfections we've seen."" Period.

I actually agree reason many supposed reinfections--that experts saying whole time. whining bad we're handling it? apparent virus gonna virus matter are. France, Spain, UK, others case counts exceed look per capita basis. Yeah, Trump covid-deniers suck would better without much.  problem it’s never month. Remember two weeks flatten curve? don’t trust goddamn thing I’m told anymore, I’m sure I’m alone. Goalposts constantly moving. there’s comprehensive strategy, goals, endgame outside lockdown say good luck feeding yourself, course you’re going get lot pissed off, non-compliant people. Yeah, ok. Either way sure sounds like huge spike cases thought already achieved herd mentality. Lol. Ffs people 😂 says even one matches first Meanwhile, WH denigrating Fauci [letting Atlas go Russia say dumb shit like lockdowns masks work...

Is end sight? America defeat pandemic? Look Vietnam, South Korea. They've got figured out. US third wave patting back 'doing better right now' Europe second wave.

In comprehensive federal survey, small fraction SNFs less 1 day turnaround staff resident testing late September 2020. Although testing delays improved time, state testing far behind less 24-hour turnaround epidemiological modeling suggests essential prevent COVID-19 outbreaks even hot spot counties facilities received point-of-care instruments mid-August, less 17% SNFs turnaround less 1 day. Conflicting regulations testing supply shortages may hampering efforts take advantage study include reliance facility-reported test result turnaround times, inability differentiate turnaround times 1 2 days owing survey design, lack data type testing used SNFs. look table, even improves values. lol. especially hate people compare US numbers US numbers. Ramping production going take while.

They've ramping production since starting Phase 3 trials. Gates Foundation, example, put big money sort at-risk production, *something* ready upon approval. Rounding lip drain... Cause commented base it. stopping testing analysis, stopping Thursday delivery home tests self-testing. “essential travel“ mean someone beg food Oh, I'll redirect /r/conspiracy dont even know im wtf talking about. know nothing situation country false reports reinfections confirmed genomic sequencing. No. 👌 Haha yes, number. *bam* nerd high-5! also moral failing catch communicable disease apply covid?  talking people buying clothing grocery stores jumped mask mandates. never said mask mandates made punish people, talking extra mandates like stopping people buying ""non-essential"" items. Like person goes grocery store also sells items like magazines, alcohol, toys children, there's good reason able purchase items. concerned crowding, put capacity limits stores instead. 

I also think approaching argument crisis situation I'm arguing long-term, post-severe outbreak restrictions. Even crisis situation, grocery store sells toys, customers able buy them. That's meant said people making rules punish people they're scientifically valid. know mask mandates based accurate science people going extra shopping online, accuse anti-mask anti-science? may used debating anti-maskers understand frustrating be, help make assumptions. Also, called twat that's ad hominem. Honestly whole situation complicated, even constitutional lawyers sure what's legal what's not, imagine lot lawsuits future various outcomes. example, forced 14-day quarantine anyone returning abroad March already declared unconstitutional courts. time state emergency, gives state lot powers normally have. legal mess, general people ok temporarily giving freedoms.

As negative certificate thing specifically, basically unless it, hard lockdown applies next round testing (next weekend). looking study done Insights Education. article it, mention find. talks estimated 300 billion missed schools days pandemic learning debt. many deaths going take people care? worry older relatives more.

That's pretty much me. Perks small country, guess. landlocked shengen zone though, keeping new cases coming might tricky I'm going anywhere. ones headed south douchebags fit right there.  Literally why

All people risk isolate everyone else able get back normal, basically risk dying you’re 45 healthy TRANSLATION:


Doctor Çelik, since beginning May reporting us regularly work senior physician isolation ward Covid 19 patients Darmstadt Hospital . Two weeks ago tested positive yourself. you?

I recovering rigors intensive therapy hospitalization. leave without trace. still feel weak, circulation causing problems. domestic isolation, can't get going taking walks. course listen deeply, precisely know look for. Overall, however, feel much better. received great sympathy friends family look well.

How illness start?

Two weeks ago, night Friday Saturday, got severe headache woke it, atypical, also Covid. Nevertheless, irritated - also knowing risk encounter week due medical emergency ward. That's paid attention symptoms usual. got fever attacks night, next day tested positive.

Are sure got infected hospital?

I can't say one hundred percent. cluster private sphere, hardly private contacts. regular contact Covid patients, makes sense. fact one got infected ward indicates systematic hygiene failure. so, punctual, unfortunate situation. work seriously ill patients Covid ward, situations arise hygiene standard self-protection suffer fact done quickly precisely. example, foggy glasses prevent making precise incision draw fluid area around lungs. cannot use glasses short time. example I'm sure many colleagues Covid stations familiar this. patient coughs moment, careful and, doubt, get tested.

What happened tested positive?

In course illness, many things unusual. 34 years old, younger people without previous illnesses disease likely mild. said again: guarantee will, individual always fit statistics. find now. general condition deteriorated massively within three days, high fever cough strong sputum. Covid complication lungs, caused condition deteriorate much within hours go intensive care unit Monday - three days onset symptoms. one lung effectively left ventilation. lung less incapacitated major bacterial infection. typical picture Covid lung disease, Covid caused bacterial superinfection settle lungs.

The clinics full corona patients again, staff reaching limit: anesthetist puts oxygen mask patient.

Has increased fear know disease well?

I state worry much fear. reaction colleagues, looked well, showed special difficult course one expected even intensive care unit. surprised shocked many colleagues - too. Fortunately, significant improvement started strong drug therapy. fact young previous illnesses. lungs recover relatively quickly inflammation.

Did feel bad afraid?

If work hospital, know it: Patients really bad fall kind apathy fixed eyes. motionless emotionless, feeling. kind self-protection. days later, conversation colleague looking night duty, worked kind precarious situation was.

Were able say choice treatment beforehand?

Sure, worked treatment standards. long state people could talk me, therapy also discussed. rather informative, clear guidelines treated what. important feel kind control therapy.

What therapy like?

It mainly antibiotic therapy bacterial infection. addition, received thrombosis shots remdesivir - condition worsened, dexamethasone also given. intensive care unit, received high-flow oxygen therapy. form nasal cannula ventilation high doses oxygen given pressure keep oxygen saturation stable. intensive care unit four days normal ward another four days.

Did go badly particularly large number viruses?

Something like basically possible, fit course had. severe course mainly due bacterial infection. complication Covid-19, pneumonia typical Covid-19.

How feel got back normal ward?

It hard time absolutely critical situation hospital still going on. Exactly fell ill, ward reorganized expected increase number Covid patients, happened. patients admitted could stand sidelines. question rounds was: ""How many patients have?"" stressful. Covid-19 cannot accelerated, however, time hospital oxygen, inflammation body temperature stable again. could released. needed oxygen hospital, ten days isolation apply time discharge. isolation expire November 4th. hope,

Has concern changed view disease?

I wish need personal impression. cannot denied sharpens view going really life-threatening course like me. want keep disease away patients care people close to. less enough ever rely statistics mild courses. Even course special, make less real.

How situation Darmstadt Clinic?

More space created Covid patients suspected cases ever before. entire station used positive cases. Thursday, 30 Covid patients normal ward seven Covid intensive care unit. additional station cleared suspected cases. staff also expanded, huge effort made within short time. cooperating even closely smaller hospitals relocating patients milder course deal complex cases. Organizationally, mammoth task.

How big concern capacities reach limits?

We already back mode postponable plannable interventions partially postponed ensure acute care normal patients emergency care Covid patients. clearly lagging behind infection process - urgently need breathe again. current infection numbers become cases requiring treatment ten days. average age sick rises, lead severe courses. whole theory, we've talking weeks months, coming full force.

Politicians reacting massive restrictions public life. understand restaurant owners, example, understand this?

Absolutely, understand discussion measures. core competence judge ones right ones. Restaurants engine infection clusters past months, understand criticism. one thing certain: need measures reduce number inpatient admissions. Otherwise unpleasant winter. good politicians reacting decisively.

Is anything gives hope face the

The self-sacrificing work clinic staff. always amazed motivation colleagues dedicate work. gives hope know people might really burns. save us worst. resource politics society rely indefinitely. I'm happy work area many people attitude. think plumbers call ""Brown Friday""... specific, expanded view elderly. yes, say fck elderly refuse best catch covid live last part life like everything ok. people overwhelm hospitals, make us pay due restrictions drive economy down. Hmmmm...for ""optimist"" seem angry. one state lockdown mask mandates last 3 months . australia enjoying xmas summer soon almost restrictions like NZ Scum exact experience district too. going well all. “early on”?. November? March? could reopened, yet? proper controls? 

I’m trouble understanding sub could advocating something ridiculous damaging. Yeah think problem many media outlets much air time enough say. many ways say ""wear mask wash hands,"" inevitably devolve opinions dramatizing events. volunteer hospitals nurse US. leaders hospital systems make millions year, nurses volunteer? That's taken advantage of. see downvotes, maybe implied sarcasm, wholly wrong. New York resident leaving state less 24 hours required take second test.

You going test positive 24 hours cases. Yeah read parent also one linked.

Not part conversation. compare directly Australia, gonna look good. many countries mandatory quarantine hotels? Hospitalisations 45+. “Hospital Admissions Age Group” here's point. happens US released vaccine right now? Especially know works better Oxford putting out? Would rushed us it, even though we've taking longer study UK/Europe? okay China Russia put there's out?



How come US gets bad wrap something better? literally months months trials? 



The troll asshole. catch less 20% infections people often asymptomatic. Maybe completely useless close enough. Enjoy shit life point testing everyone relatively small period? Let's say total population country 100. tested Monday 1 person Covid. thing find 1 person it, person quarantine everyone came contact them. 

What people tested, get Covid person it? results come back 3-7 days (not sure long takes), show it, assume safe. people think test spreading even though test said negative. 

I saying happen plausible, wanted explain thoughts mass testing could cause problems give false sense security. 

Why testing everyone important? fact is, selfish, self righteous douchebag. Period. spread virus someone else infringing life, liberty pursuit happiness.  Common decency empathy almost non-existent country embarrassing. Enjoy transverse myelitis. old / live parents, own? own, go. stopped going thanksgivings couple years college. People gave nasty ""it's really sad anything"" text messages, big deal. English trade, business air language world. common language spoken people living modern society. Everything shared needs also English. Saw somewhere recently Pennsylvania peak January way cases I'd think it'd much sooner. Singapore interesting technologically advanced futuristic, prison system outright barbaric. American prisons get bad rap least lashings thing Florida remains 9th place US, 10th place deaths read parent comment, also one linked.

I'm taking offense, I'm pointing dumb meaningless whole comparison is. I've already pointed times sub prone extreme oversimplification. guess comes territory default subs, still. According 6-in-10 rate economic conditions negatively 2-in-10 think coronavirus control U.S., according latest Fox News national survey likely voters.

Even that's right, that's 20% country (maybe 10% talked republicans) think situation control. That's lot.  vote! 1918 Flu. 

It’s sad got almost hundred years worth extra medical knowledge still end situation. Well, economy better Democrats. Deficits decline Democrats. international relations improve Democrats. 

I guess Trump may appeal people like getting lied every third breath, count number. mean first one, one conversation under, says ""Europe amirite?"" specific....

There's reason someone one European countries done things mostly right take offense general comment like that. believe that's correct interpretation. Within 30 min, 99.999% virus eliminated (LR = 5.12). Within 10 min, virus eliminated (LR = 2.31). layer beneath CAZ claimed filter airborne particles. accurate, good deal (though all) virus would inhaled trapped eventually neutralized virucidal layer.

[Recent shows reducing viral inoculum (amount exposed to) lead less severe symptoms lower risk death. believe mask effective protecting wearer reusable masks disposable surgical masks. Normality killing people good news. Please retreat troll cave turn oxygen hope so. becoming optimistic got worried past week! Never thought I’d crave normalcy badly referring Donald Trump? guy upset US continued test people virus, thus kept finding new cases?

Right. Spot on. Also, believe fighting others freedoms own. Ben je dat, Maurik? Yeah one things helped Canada trash weather march/april initial outbreak. ended lockdown compliance went shitter noticeably. least enough time things like prep hospitals get people used idea wearing masks mandated. readily accept mortality associated flu. Oh good news? bad news US actually uphold higher standards releasing vaccine early. Vaccines put hold well tested MUCH THOROUGHLY? Bohemian/Czech brothers 2 weeks ahead number cases. We'd amount cases nothing done (they around 12 000+ cases day,and population around 10 mil).
I hope sort well, somehow. currently lockdown. wish good luck.

So 2 weeks time decide do. rather experimental, turned ok :D.
On friday (day first day testing) around 60-70% medical personnel, capacities filled around 98% saturdays morning. close. agree. since taking British ales... honestly know sarcastic not, let's clear, meant. blaming younger people statement, younger people enabling behavior. populations trying protect willing wear mask admit real happening, position make rule going take vulnerable member population public setting, take safety measures well. know changing habits remembering new stuff get harder one ages, that's younger population needs step reminders education, fails, rules protection everyone. I'm quite sure got FUCK ELDERLY that.  suppose, sorry. October 2021? think way clear then. thing keeping sane video games. get work 6 immediately go home, eat dinner sit computer til bedtime. Keep mind somewhat normal pandemic happened, least would go stuff occasionally, anything

I've seen past months.

Shout-out dude called communist help put mask “...And contract now, we’ll throw free set Ginsu knives!”  right, comment satire. I'm happy give credit credit due.  number active cases still rises despite lower daily cases long time. long active cases still rise flattened. Tried KF94? Echinacea elderberry stimulate immune system. That's bad autoimmune disease virus cause cytokine storm. Tumeric strange anti-inflammatory. Thats done Belfast,Ireland. 
All final year nurses quickly moved uni ward within weeks first surge. 5 day work week scam anyway. haven’t worked Friday 3 years. Working 5 days 1.5 way live US needs change Texas running 9,000,000 less tests.

how cost-efffective! Freedom people. you’re worried getting sick option stay home. That’s makes America great! Spanish flu make America mask wearing culture either. Americans even shorter memory years past. going start wearing mask cold/flu COVID. drastically overestimate publics memory major events. 

 rather cold flu get out, wear it. gesture done many Asian countries even pre-covid.

People Asian countries whole way considerate Americans.





In mid 2000's, Republicans trashed economy power decades. However, voters forgot gave House 2 years later. Pundits always assume people much longer memory do.

This sub representative average American. Spreading covid bois looking forward still around Easter simply see wrong again? lots people understand per capita numbers think US reporting highest daily case numbers we're still worst country far. Europe far worse us point. much much bigger population. Yes, lockdowns devastate economy except short term (during lockdown) . Covid devastates economy long term. Well managed right timed lockdown drops infections level economy active basic social distancing rules. Well it’s easier enforce quarantine people know individually. It’s far harder it’s everyone city. even issues getting people cooperate contact tracers. There’s requirement give information consequences don’t. Ya option I'll taking significant pay cut we're looking reluctant possibilities. even use *Statewide* strategy. areas State almost covid going down, areas increasing illness. Locking area that's fine dumb. that's restrictions, social distancing, masks, measures put place areas around country. ok, know bluster notice initial comment Czech Republic. thought writing Slovakia. read. worry. know doing. must suck you. live outside Dallas walks life wearing masks,not rednecks. indian guy gas station getting masters data science...no mask, hispanic laborers home depot...no mask, everyone shopping/working ace hardware sanger...no mask. you’re probably US know France Germany. like 30 countries Europe 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 didnt say you. hilariously bad logic debate someone supposedly master's. Whew, thank God I'm US anymore arkansas problem. call department health get tested day. turn results 1.5 days. live Colombia. Things bad right now. many businesses shut many people lost jobs. amount people streets begging doubled, people desperate things food money.

It's horrible situation. super strict lockdown beginning, government understands people survive another one. like choice let people get infected, else people going starve. So? comment replied described America. reply America. yeah shit, every single country Still, Ireland countries outside North America celebrate it? already call ""Democrat"" is. Harshest insult know. thought testing meant cases? could be?!?!?! Good luck making Americans stay home. Even “lockdown” March Americans shopping parties homes. always put lockdown quotes, never really was. NJ, anywhere US I’m aware of. laughed saying US Nazi Germany, indeed hilariously dumb. said ignorant history.

Then got sad pointed anyone uneducated history, me.

I'm sorry upset lmao silly thing said. ITT: people fantasize non lockdown world looks like, make things.

No, Sweden proof. They're screwed, comparing Sweden 3rd world country. Something something incivility. picked something similar Menards. Two actually couple spare filters. Hope never feel compelled use don’t exactly know “they” is, mean WH yeah, I’m definitely defending people. 

I really don’t know mean “ethereal idea compliance fatigue”. “ethereal” that? mean compliance fatigue real, well, I’d say take look around compare March.

As “people say ‘fuck that’ good excuse keep truth reasonable people”— “the truth” here? Policy-making around covid judgement call based politics input multidisciplinary array experts (I’m hoping, least). “the truth” mean vaccine available, it’s expected guaranteed widely available spring next year.

Additionally, public health measures realistic achievable. Expecting population remain compliant year come neither. Ok well disagree based saw. one anything saw anyone two months. commuted week completely empty building (literally, people went would stayed home) roads absolutely empty rush hour. US many roadways states. Even unpopulated areas multiple roads across state lines. Maybe comparable New south Wales state. looks like many roads get state. state effective keep state borders closed monitored? Girlfriends family friend small, immediate family gathering. 11 people total including 2 babies. 9 people, including two 80 something-year-old grandparents got covid. 

Even small gatherings ok. Perfect enemy good. Yes island must also know immortality rate then, guess? inevitable lockdown comes, complain 2+ month lockdown awful. people, lockdown tacked onto end self-imposed lockdown. 

I’m fortunate live Australia, definitely don’t isolate like start year. glad don’t live Melbourne. 

When guys lockdown, make sure get right. Don’t allow “economists” convince opening early good economy; getting things control damaging couple extra weeks precautionary lockdown. I've noticed recently, deaths beginning creep Europe US, brigaders Daily Discussion threads quietened bit. They've stopped commenting much, they're still there, mass-downvoting anyone showing even slightest hint taking precautions. look realclearpolitics clear Trump going lose. There's also bias comes Trump polls many people embarrassed say vote time vote.

I think Bush would win second term either. ... better, metric.

Including muh economy. many people would like believe US worst right now, proud beacon hope Europe toilet well. People held Europe America's head months made comparisons showing bad US doing, places Europe far worse suddenly comparisons need stop? Lol no.




Narrative games aside, basic valid per capita comparison problem. Simple that. oh know (outside USa) Nope, see comment trail. empirically demonstrable failure formulate substantive counterargument. restating comment saying Im bad. Jesus, fines huge. That’s like enough money buying used car.

A little harsh. Yes lockdowns. Especially America. coming time AA lowest unemployment EVER. scared hell white liberals. black man $ black man can’t control. trying destroy African American communities well poor minority. Lockdowns ZERO health. know don’t work. I'm saying general, reason public platform force one language, live world thousands languages exsist. wish we’d Sweden does: hire ton contract tracers force individuals families get quarantine. would allow people go daily life without much issue majority population. governors enacting policies protect citizens. maybe, god forbid, exists federal government actually set general system deal this. right, course. issue first full season idea much conditions increase spread covid. know likely zero important make sure keep influenza. allow get control take steps limit spread, could potentially even worse. Decades? Immortality via transferring consciousness feasible decades. think line San Francisco US. somewhat bare-bones unsparing. 80 covid-positive? Automatic Do-Not-Resuscitate. mean going get treated, hard limit much expended. guess we’re screwed then. youtuber thinks mask nothing people remain infected months. slow recovery. comment would make sense if

1) completely misread modernization theory says (i.e., open societies come economic growth, before)

2) fail realize functional educational institutions ALREADY EXIST China Tell person disrespectful idiot bot operate almost full capacity time. Lots hospitals become “overwhelmed” average flu season. read articles outlined beginning pandemic. hospital easy increasing inbound patients percent. straight terrifying would look apocalyptic scenario taking account everything stands way happening. Stop panic monger. It’s juvenile.

How argument still think making coherent point? think going happen millions people get sick time? majority people don’t die, need hospitalized. What’s going happen need oxygen there’s 100 people also waiting get oxygen. Nobody immune this. People get sick. isn’t simple little cough. buying time. everyone part, wouldn’t mess. Doctors, private healthcare, health insurance, big pharma companies going rich Better flu, basically tired asf really people going NY western MA, urban areas, tho. Bit different story there. Cuba deserves better this. calculate foreign aid percentage GDP, wonder people world generous Cubans. I'll never forget plane sitting runway filled doctors, hoping help victims Hurricane Katrina, waiting permission, permission never came. Sanctions need lifted. Utah last week, group hospital administrators presented Gov. Gary Herbert list criteria doctors would use decide patients receive intensive care, [The Salt Lake reported.  plan, requires governor’s approval, would take account patient’s condition, likelihood survival, age.

This utterly bizarre situation hospital rationing care requires sort government approval. Hospitals established protocols algorithms ethics boards reason. heard Kim Kardashian hired island ""find form normality"". Seems good fit ask me. ration, need criteria I'm insinuating idea exponential growth works. Rationing care option limited number beds.   

Once beds full, everyone get turned away, anyone needs hospitalized hospitalized **WILL DIE**.  

If virus left unchecked could see every hospital lower 48 overwhelmed, 980,000 hospital beds U.S. hospitals get overwhelmed goes 4 5 weeks, could easily millions dead May.  

If think economy looks bad know, 30% population COVID, hospitals overwhelmed, running medical supplies, sick people left die home.  

People willing lose jobs rather get sick care options available.  country come complete standstill, beginning. Right. Nobody disputing longterm health impacts covid-19. Anywhere East Asia would preferable mess west right now. Ordinarilly complicated make move decent career history I'm afraid pretty much looked laughing stock par US right countries would looking at. say understand sentiment can't really close borders within Europe. Imagine Germany 9 borders non existent.

Note would love country well implement strict managed quarantine.

Now, UK, Iceland, etc. excuse honestly. Wait.

Because get gloves NAPA suddenly enough N95 masks doctors nurses able use needed? countries require proof vaccination certain diseases. could end like that. Tell Europeans benign get back me.
Your figures way wrong way, Reddit, Facebook Twitter reliable sources information, American neither President. US. think lot people like bash US blame politics. across whole Europe too. late May around 10,000 excess deaths / week. mean that's really two options, comment kinda indicates. follow all? Oh, thank goodness! Dr common man found box gloves! country SAVED! thought one scaremongering themes linked democrats. all, going allow/deny medical care people *not related rich are*. far Connor Reed’s death concerned. stupid people, really ""Westerners"". people stupid wear helmet going space. stupid would burn shields legion archers nocking arrows. No, son, I'm not. Again, I'm sorry data support emotions feelings. That's going happen educated run mouth things fully understand. much respect dr. Fauci. He's almost 80 still fighting good fight. deserves much better happening right treating him. US least, really can't survive without car. like 99% people aged 20-60 one. 

But there's also delivery. weird coincidence Africa less sophisticated healthcare low cases take drug though hmmm....

Or maybe big pharma colluding doctors make money Remdesivir thing essentially except costs around $2700 dollars

The amount doctors get kickedbacked must pretty nice. Would rather get kick back something costs $2700 $3?

Big pharma executives seeing dollar bills everywhere moment, number deaths Jakarta surging. might like 4-6 weeks ago.

[Jakarta Sees Record Burial Numbers number burial 90 day prior pandemic. peak early September reach 180 day. Outside September, govered 120-150. last two weeks 100-120.

This official Jakarta government website. [The number burials every day number burials listed website.

The reporter mostly given task finding juicy story corona virus Indonesia, without leave Jakarta. reality cases gradually going down, deaths also dropping. It’s change. It’s different law enforcement agency. Ideally, would Sheriff’s Office Police Department working conjunction. right now, Sheriff’s office complying police department not. police chief can’t anything without city council instructing to. He’s bit at-will employee, unlike Sheriff elected. City council could fire doesn’t toe line. Clearly know lot history do, trust say worry you. Explains reinfection we’ve seen. Again, son, comes viral direct viral clearance response reinfection, CD8 cells important.  case missed upthread:

Just clarify — you’re incorrect. 

And it’s actually sort offensive misrepresent experience push agenda. student, originally Llandudno, north Wales, beat killer bug “glass hot whisky honey”, Mr Reed said time, [**and returned UK year undertake degree Chinese language Bangor ... heartbroken mum Hayley said post Facebook **her son found dead halls residence Bangor (Wales, UK) University** last week.

As timeline:

.2. quite sick protracted period time disease progressed cold-like symptoms severe pneumonia. 

.3. Lockdowns didn’t even start China (or anywhere else, matter) late January 2020. pandemic declared Jan. 30, 2020. 

.4. **Connor pleaded — publicly repeatedly — people take disease seriously.**

[Here’s non-tabloid third moisture filter growing bacteria? masks vented? scale virus mutation, mutating less year pretty fast could impact vaccines I’m waiting see states start stay home orders again. It’s difficult support without federal stimulus, numbers last couple weeks worse April.

Politicians probably reluctant lockdown Thanksgiving Christmas backlash would receive, idk anything point. Case numbers way higher, treatment seems bit better less people dying April May. They’ll pull infected tooth. And, unfortunately, [that take mostly Well 21 weeks approximately 200,000 excess deaths time. little bit low side thanks pandemic weaker warm summer months. also much lower IFR, approximately half April. sure better treatment another factor. 

That mixed blessing pulled America complacency hammer us hard October-infected people start dying November. Perhaps get back 20,000 deaths/week near future. hard flu season, could spike back 40,000. 

My big question major mutation make virus virulent, deadly, resistant vaccine. Hence big error bar 2021 death toll: 50k - 18m likely around 200k. Many survivors seem suffer anxiety depression, especially hospitalized. thread one paper discussing things. Sad life ended young age. news report? They’ve literally trialed every major medical center US. led WORSE outcomes. Reading sites linked info wars doesn’t make educated WHO? safe approach. last thing want rush something make everything worse. Japan Vietnam around 100 million people. Korea 50 million.

Okay *believe* respect wants families don’t want risk

No fucking don't. Otherwise irresponsible going around putting others risk becoming carrier less 10 months left stage life.

So? one, self-centered spoiled brat.   There’s abundance PPE. aren’t zero supplies, aren’t much better. government assistance everyone? hope talking US, definitely isn't. Oh right.

This isn’t Black Death. Stop acting like post imagining two people tied together rope trying run opposite directions, course neither ends getting anywhere want go. Unfortunately, seems general public's response virus many countries. want get cases spread never able get low enough many people ignoring social distancing mask measures. People want virus spread unchecked everyone get virus get past foiled staying home following social distance/mask protocols. end stuck middle place one getting want. like first wave outbreaks Australia Autumn got shut June. relapsed July overcome again. completely demonstrates plausible shut virus winter willing take required steps Understandable!

Toddlers: nowhere warning worlds immediately shrunk size without capability understand. Vital, crucial aspects lives like softplays libraries nurseries etc expanded minds play socialising cut overnight. returned since first lockdowns done diminished capacity. average 3 year old spent 15-20% existence planet lacking key developmental functions society, they're aware lack understanding comprehend why.

School kids: obvious one it? Old enough miss pals aware grown ups around talking killer virus need afraid of. old school kids missed exams, future apply university jobs they'll forever branded generation never got results.

Both toddlers school kids receiving end cruel experiment may caused untold damage many them. know, signs far good.

Young adults: imagine going university find ended prison. Imagine getting new job January find made redundant furloughed shortly after. Imagine knowing afford live ever see friends again? Except instead young enough state sees dependent, seen adult told fend yourself.

Working adults/parents: one me, hi. Working home ""luxury"" afford I'm callous tone-deaf enough assume everyone else age kids can. there's already. even relative comfort (for thankful) everyday spent panic/survival mode, juggling responsibilities clients wife kids ever support network involved childcare (kids clubs, nursery, childminder, trips library) gone diminished.

So yes, entire generations. hope case *the absence effective community mitigation* you’re still getting?

The people know better Schengen suspended long. good luck kilometers trucks.

How going implement managed quarantine every car crosses border?

Btw, there's already ""border restrictions"" place see effective are. saw plenty first four months recently. deny it, keep saying things different labels. there's downvote squad. One key commonality. Super strict border controls - residents allowed enter heavily enforced 2 week quarantine. first month pandemic, idiots neighborhood organizing food trucks come in. live without fucking taco weeks interest public health? Yesterday, went ahead annual Halloween parade trick treated well. Meanwhile, person household goes husband work. exactly 3 times since mid-March. kids once: go Target birthdays pick presents. 

The overwhelming selfishness people around astounding. I’ve come conclusion family remain seclusion foreseeable future responsible caring fellow citizens beyond people. Except catch people speeding. put cop highway radar gun. can't catch people unless stop EVERYONE inspection works take minutes. That's unenforceable. can't enforce everyone can't enforce anyone. Sure 1 year good bet 1 year enough reported muscle damage heart brain damage damage permanent compounding one year enough. I’m doc I’m rambling behind paywall realistically speaking lasted 2 weeks followed re-opening everything restrictions (capacity/masks/plexiglass). 

Right now, nobody Europe believes ""November Lockdown"" extended December even January since back March/April Governments already lied multiple times duration 1st lockdown.

People's trust Governments gone across Europe (except perhaps Sweden).  already rationing care, prediction? It’s god given right ignore critical infrastructure failure. Yeah stat wise looking good live big city work I’d say 30-40% people still don’t wear mask inside. Rural Florida driving stopping gas station one mask on. Obviously hoping get better worse happy lack masks distancing.   Except billion people China get Sinovax (I think called) already rolled out. asian countries might also choose Chinese Vaccine.   Billion people India probably mostly get one vaccines.   

Russia use home grown vaccine well.  billion people West probably get first dibs vaccines American/European companies. Every country earth vaccination plan, date \*the earliest possible vaccination date\*. vaccine ready then, put motion. not, plan pushed forward say 1 month time.

This non-news. Every country vaccination plan, ready use late 2020, even though course able mass vaccinate 2021. plans still though. would pretty dumb country found suddenly millions doses vaccine, use plan. matter believe not. fact China handled virus million times better US. lot foreigners right attest that. It’s best comparison right I'm Chicago, house Chicago, spent whole life Chicago, ""another state"" far I'm concerned. Hey, glad see still stalking months later. Stay creepy dude. current growth rate USA 1.2 week week (on 7 day averages).

This exponential growth. sustained rate 9 weeks averaging 203k cases day (all 7 day averages) 5th Dec 421k cases day week ending 2nd Jan. gives us 14.2 million cases. missing average 50% cases growth rate true 1.2 week week, 28.4 million.

Of course growth rate could increase decrease this. week week growth rate 1.35 averaged 9 weeks would lead 1.25m daily cases time, although level model going completely changed overwhelming testing capacity completely (and hospitals).

That leaves us 30.8 million new cases 2nd Jan, assuming we're missing 50% cases now, ramp true 1.35 per week average regardless ability keep up, leaves us 61.6 million true infections 1st Nov-2nd Jan.

If exceed that, I'm discounting, growth rate must exceed 1.35 week week average 9 week period.

Of course peak 421k 1.25m cases day (or twice true infections), long climb well total numbers would still ramp quickly weeks peak, least period would faster time way up. SARS-CoV-2 severe seasonal Coronaviruses, theory immunity last longer seasonal Coronavirus immunity except mild cases.  It’s Halloween party!

Mainly European countries, Israel, Japan, South Korea, Mexico. information? can't use isolate trace people like PCR test. 10 20% seropositive could let people immunity return work. use seropositivity individual level whole population, statistically (e.g. find areas more/less hit on)? FDA’s review system works differently, one leg Warp Speed they’ll get insight interim analyses. need rolling analyses FDA system. lifting lockdown Australia ?

(in seriousness) Sweden provided reasons bash Sweden, deniers amplify this.  know interview Dr. Fauci said otherwise that's case that's unfortunate building supplies cases down. Maybe doctors nurses getting break... use data generated though ongoing targeted tests contacts positive people catch outliers.

Especially I, nobody, buy N95 masks. get means nurses doctors can. idk extent pointless enforce strict travel protocols across landlocked regions probably something Europe might see US Europe Canada Japan, etc... Facepiece inhale exhale valves, breath cross filters collect bacteria. Exhaled breath hits plastic duct condenses droplets directed downwards, away around you. significantly safer around unfitted mask (fabric, surgical, etc) tends leak sides. way safely US unless long, strict, 3+ month lockdown. That's taken successful countries legitimately reopen safely. However, shorter less strict lockdowns still work effectively would certainly help bring numbers temporarily. constant back forth game lessening tightening restrictions either vaccine highly effective treatment developed. latest spike attributed small private gatherings 5-6 people. lockdown US capable stop gatherings. best close non-essentials give people nothing outside homes, can't stop what's currently causing spread. Good job Slovakia! Definitely. heard Cuomo changed order, allowing residents without quarantining. one know. old Dutch woman undergone chemo wiped immunity out. there's double standard thinking. holds follow covid prevention protocols responsibe health, blatantly ignored health years ways named many more.

I find odd little attention placed person's responsibility keep oneself healthy possible prevent and/or mitigate severity symptoms one contract virus.

Not word mainstream media US. Europe no/little capacity bursted middle crisis.

Most emergency hospitals built get used. people testing positive remnants. impossible eradicated virus many cases already since beginning. Europe locked 3 months eradication even close. would lockdown knows many months, ban movements long. interconnected country like Europe, would acceptable many aspects. It’s always easy say “just lockdown”, “you need eradicate” - country it’s different response it’s possible Chill, friend. We're seeing orange Matterhorn (2020) squatting next Mt Everest (2018) K2 (2017), think he's saying he's little underwhelmed height next brothers. certainly am. People don’t care anymore, it’s fucked world live isn’t it? I’ll keep part masking social distancing, seems like empathetic ones amongst losing battle. went back soft, open pubs shit look landed ya. whatever makes feel better ever-increasing chance catch plague die dude. immune response could one prevents illness rather infection. although someone catch virus won’t get sick. Vaccines serve purpose well Governor say court decisions. haven’t months minority wants option 2, imo. It’s last resort. That’s question. testing positive active virus inactive remnants? Everybody expected logistical disaster, example done like 45 minutes entering line receiving sealed envelope result.(the testing reaction takes 20-30 minutes) Today testers complaining enough people coming in, everyone eligible tested yesterday. operation could done even faster. Amazing work Slovak military medical personell. bars restaurants One would guess test gives right/wrong diagnostic depending case hand, randomly breath. would schedule 2. Im american, guess differs country country. case trump could well lose election, biden doesnt seem like kind guy completly ignore virus like trump does, “even president it” argument could useless couple months double take. Thought posted conservatives subredit. optimistic moment maybe valuing science. Silly me. denialists said couldn’t get control! high school near shut Melbourne student tested positive. one. School closed deep cleaning two weeks, teachers given 2 weeks off, paid course.

But I'm measures allowed us get 720 cases day Melbourne July, hit 0 three times row, us 20k tests per day still. people retain right rebel. already happening Michigan go extent anywhere near bad going get here, sure already happening places too. Yeah, think many people want wear masks time... time would probably consider wearing mask pandemic get groceries feeling sick... generally avoid going I'm sick.

There certain amount privilege viewpoint, though, I'm living paycheck-to-paycheck, usually well stocked pantry/freezer, huge inconvenience risk skip getting groceries week two. Dont ever change, crazy latter day saints. mean fair, reason seeing people stores without masks largely required, necessarily people trying careful.  New York **same percentage** nursing home deaths many states countries.  

Why didn’t Arizona Nebraska better numbers Cuomo? say keep shut 10% occupancy that... Schools open though no? course, government care controlling virus. making hen feather. I've watched almost every press briefing recommendations communications made says otherwise. ”others” say numbers hilariously low make sense it. seems misconception people get COVID crazy mask deniers go party (and likely contract course), people I've know who've got ""careful"" continued see friends family without masks. say 10 people even 5 people whatever, need come contact 1 person positive get it. People keep forgetting point limiting gatherings spread lots people once. guys think end? \*sigh\*  It’s sad. grew Decatur it’s frustrating see happening. friend Georgia caught Covid flu time. She’s liver transplant patient. taken Mayo Clinic convalescent plasma, remsdirvir, plenty b12, oxygen week still isn’t well.

Don’t mind typos... wait vaccine available make mandatory go cruise? Get beers 23,800,000 Africans infected HIV 69% worldwide cases

Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* media hyping everything. need clicks ad revenue life blood business. Fear breeds clicks. remember that. Well precisely majority choosing option 2; believe choosing “if ignore long enough go away” 10 days always used 14 two weeks. Can't sure. seemed lag policy effects. many Americans would die virus everyone knows someone died it? fear that's what's going happen take seriously.

Edit: kind dumb ass would downvote legitimate question? even question answered math. actual answer. happens Europeans go camping like 500 years... Sorry rude. It’s emotional subject me. live people get spread virus good cause? No-one obey Christmas anyway, holiday have. replying post. yes quote almost 1 1000 accurate. think last saw around 0.80 1000.

I sure channel3000 coming 30% JHU significantly less. It’s like quoting random source. JHU one reliable sources pandemic USA. Good. Forced vaccination way end pandemic. “wide ranging” interview Fauci, ask we’re not? Yeah, one got zero closing *everything* sitting *was* zero? get ""down"" 1000 day?

We half ass it. 


Just enough. news days journalism it’s true sense dead. I'm quite sure do. test weekly work, great, I'm going visit family Christmas. I'll week, I'm sure how/where test I'm need test fly back. certainly test upon return NY. workplace at-home option people mail in, I'm sure week I'm town. don’t think precedent this. sure given global crisis tests monitored high levels contaminate double blind status. hundreds thousands getting sick every day must keeping tabs 50,000 people vaccinated. suspect see greatly lower incidence infection among 50,000 people would say “hey seems like working let’s start mobilizing save lives.” least would doing. Stick original dates stop imposing rules, one other. People fed up. They're often typical cheap laser thermometer guns find Amazon There’s shitton people don’t wanna hear that. Springfield last week it’s amazing masks worn. region locking hospitals tomorrow it’s bad. dad hospital today 10 days downright scary possibly stuck without least one family member heart surgery. looking rehab facilities moultrie county half outbreaks. Needless say, decided keep them. Oregon one lowest rates coronavirus country protests. outdoors mask relatively safe. Shocked Pikachu Wisconsin testing gotten better, even nowhere close needs get complete picture pandemic. States like Iowa, Wyoming, Idaho, Kansas, etc. critically under-testing. example, Wisconsin 4x testing per capita Iowa is. definitely wearing airplanes. used get sick every flight I'm like keep wearing mask over. thought Cuomo control. happened?  know vast majority people hiv medication right? It’s less 1% Nigerians Thats insane. 1 case high school city 5 million immediately closed entire high school 2 weeks tested 3000 people, students students families.

This case cause concern us, one mystery cases time, finding came important control spread more. 

The amount political shit smearing media propaganda created shit, world, even Australia control it, mindblowing. federal PM done nothing attack Labor run states (Centre left major party) lockdowns enacted control Coronavirus, simultaneously pushing welfare cuts, unemployment cuts, funding cut mental health services, 10 minutes party talks Labor parties lockdowns caused unemployment, financial trouble, rise mental health issues. Wisconsin, right leaning counties north getting wrecked covid. Per capita Wisconsin worse NYC hight outbreak. Um. 

They used “and” there. 

Maybe English second language, means blaming federal government ALSO schools opening up. 

Of course, federal government issue advice governors schools open. 

It’s almost like nine million cases lots blame go around. isnt ending probably end 2021/beginning 2022 vaccine super widespread, even try anymore know quarantining wont end this. Custodian, stocking supplies, etc. Based American political talking point, see inflated amount cases per capita testing much. /s forget CDC.

TBH public health doctors need take good, hard look right now. 

Wait, no, they've done excellent job creating massive clusterheck conflicting narratives / misinformation / manipulation, people actually trust now. That’s great, disagreeing. might want start getting shit ready.

It took 2 weeks get medical ship together last time. late wasn’t even used much. course, you’re land locked isn’t helpful it’s FEMA National Guard. prepping now.

We this. right leadership. they’re without Trump’s help. Imagine that. made aware via social media classmate went rally we're pretty close proximity way classroom seating setup. I've super top things since March successfully avoided family getting thing. I've avoided gatherings friends hosted, avoided people (indoors), avoided going bars breweries weekly occasion prior this. I've made sacrifices, know share room proximity one people fucking frustrating. I'm somewhat high-risk folks live exactly young.

All what? see Trump person? Yea, risk seems worth it. /s important thing know exponential growth nothing exponential long. Australia, wrestle crocs brown

ourselves Murdoch plague we'll sweet. ""covid fatigue"" wants use reason going yolo... please know people serving critically ill patients experiencing something many orders magnitude more. emotionally drained. resources help help us drained well. I.E suppressing virus infections.

Nope. SLOWING virus infections.

The strategy preventing people becoming infected, spreading rate infection longer period time - ultimate goal allowing herd immunity develop without overwhelming medical system one moment.

No attempt ever made actually halt spread virus. significant proportion first wave even bother testing people. Yeah understand that. I’m saying want see work large population without producing complications put body. sure I’m getting called antivaxxer r/coronavirus people love jump conclusions won’t end friendship it, it’s truly disturbing makes question I’d want hang someone mindset.

I'm confused this. truly disturbing question hang someone like this, end friendship it? NY statewide shutdown again. economy can't afford February that's Biden wins Dems take senate. Cuomo localized lockdowns then. American real football... Would rather wait line outside hospital days give chance try? start, hard lockdown ended 6 months ago we've entire summer freedom since (I assume suggest low-level restrictions masks destroyed lives). looming lockdown, schools unis open in-person teaching normal.

Toddlers: argument may merit age group alone- intimate social interaction age important part long-term development. 3 months, ""15-20% existence"". I'd need evidence destroyed lives. alternative time? Contact play young children almost guarantee parents get infected; shielding elderly- grandparents too.

School kids: School kids get level results. Although, predicted grades unfairly low public outcry many grades revised upwards. that's Tories Tories, direct effect lockdown. Nothing said school kids equates lives destroyed.

Young adults: Well again, that's Tories fault sending kids uni right announcing they'll lock accommodation ended remote learning anyway. Anyone government sense would advised move student accommodation first place instead done remote learning home (which totally sufficient uni kids life destroying). ""Imagine knowing afford live""- government plenty resources financially support people who've made redundant furloughed. direct effect lockdown.

Working adults/parents: I'm sorry hear particular situation nothing equates entire generation's lives destroyed. Again, school nurseries going remain open upcoming lockdown.

Pensioners: mean see relatives, able closely mingle throughout summer. Church cinemas open throughout summer. Anyway, one generation certain virus harmful anti-covid measures we've seen.

So no, none said equates lives entire generations destroyed. So, melodrama.   COVID-19 nasty. Many people become asymptomatic spreaders even develop conventional symptoms like cough fever would persuade stay home. show symptoms though. truly pathetic. happy? *do* propose doing? Definitely *nothing*, eh? mean “skill-free” ? Touché. test "" I, donald j trump, superman, need expirimental treatments, limited pharmaceuticals, private hospital, private medivac, phalanx doctors. Quit covid, covid, covid, whining!"".

Expecting quick boot out. unproven though? would probably tested 50k people prior approvals. *literally* name disease? Albeit informal one? scientific consensus agree certainty. 17% second wave infection clusters linked fucking eat help scheme encouraged everyone gather indoors eat without masks crowded restaurants. Adult adult transmission indoors hospitality risk infection highest. Child child transmission schools relatively uncommon comparison.

I would intuition read research, simply correct. kids carriers.

I'm still staying fuck away disease bags though. sure hell eating indoors since start pandemic. 97,000 new cases reported

*Reported*. Say again, *reported*. New cases *reported* new cases. amount new cases *reported* depends actual amount new cases amount testing. actual amount new cases depend amount new cases *reported* amount testing.

What worried new cases *reported* making someone look bad. reasonable people worried actual number new cases far high easily preventable, harmful contagion. disingenuously conflating us saying ""there many people infected COVID-19"" malicious claim important thing us suppress information many people actually infected contagious, harmful virus. I’m Tory fair wasn’t going introduce measures Monday hand Ed due newspapers leaking it. 

He probably shouldn’t set press conference early afternoon needed 2 days prep hours cut slack. 

That’s thing I’ll give slack though. Oh wow, guys get low 5C? Dang, US? I'm low they'd give 50,000 IU weekly supplement sure. repost of? use search function URL cohort Covid far less, least year, year 125,000 deaths 25-44. 2,000 COVID. 123,000 87,500,000 pop . 0.14%. sure average year looks like. I'll look up. Many kids rely school adequate meals. Avoiding helping either know restaurants ever recover fully. Eating first expense cut recession, right? effects virus going felt years.

Which, nobody tries use anti-lockdown thing... mass death also pretty fucking bad economies too. There's good solution point. fair, that's plausible plan long commit seeing one else immediately party next 14 days.

That said, even simple flu feels like hell earth. worse, even survival less guaranteed, something I'd risk wanting get something attending large party. infographic says That’s equivalent 680000 US cases 

(See dumb metric is?) I've prescription years. Every year test I'm 35, okay means need keep taking prescription supplement keep there. That's nice Lmao! Basically Better plan? memories brain encoded year—the equivalent brain would encode 2 normal years. science right indicating children spread covid less affects part country - part country locks down

affects whole country - whole country locks down

Where’s bias? *lockdown* lasts couple months less time. It’s 365-day lockdown it?! It’s like you’re idiot purpose. still summer vacations you’ll likely christmas, stop whiny drama queen, isn’t first world comforts. share market barometer success failure. 

this one frustrating points, absolute irony still going tank things get worse. We're going ton people dead, even economy silver lining. Everything going shit. According primary school plays tiny role... articles children transmit less adults. that's case open primary schools  Cool. potato sandwich, see. Yes are, even orders clothing went India years ago currently flowing back China. kids? ask regularly receive emails lice, pinworm infections spreading around. mention knowing son habit sticking things hands mouth touching everything.

I'd also say young kids uni students two groups one fully take care cannot. uni student learning home, means stays home learn. young kid means supervisor must also stay home. That's big reason unis go remote learning younger grades not. busy give national adress country radical changes way life? Glad he's got priorities straight. per capita equivalent, like France, UK, Italy reporting 1300 deaths :( mail-order tests do. Might bit dumb question, ""nationwide"" ""in england"" fit? england considered whole nation, even though part UK? missing something else? Especially another round wasted spring forward. happened year. I'm sorry hear that, hopefully, state able get (at least things like Chihuahua). better start thinking could beat like did. We're left dust. Yep, get covid, stitches tetanus shot bill. UK embarrassment. US Republicans kinda expect shitty UK land keep calm carry on. still worked supermarket I'd love to, makes soul crushing job bit fun. love deflection though. Nah dont put fries chip cob need proper chips,cut think finger potatoe,bit salt &amp; vinegar sprinkle bit grated cheese it.

I always wear mask unfortunately work high-volume retail location many customers come unmasked told stop them.  


I scheduled test tomorrow, unfortunately find options rapid testing got one 2-3 day turnaround. Rupert Murdoch man done much harm, guy running USA UK abyss. USA gonna civil war election. destroying democracies. might busy? work facility requires testing high priority status results, haven’t got tests back taken results 12 days ago, 9 days ago 4 days ago. point, whoever tests positive 12 days ago, even matter we’ve exposed now. first wave lockdowned later UK did. difference London alone double population twenty times smaller area. lucky live remote island edge world people get symptoms though Boris talk sense Trump None restrictions going protect teachers, grandparents, others risk groups long schools open. Irish charts found Seriously bag move that. seeing later posts, sounds like real class act. 

And did, bad.
And was, that's big deal.
And is, fault.
And was, mean it.
And did.
We deserved it. Thats point.... point would better control soon saw numbers US begin spike lot sudden, began panic buying. knew second time would worse first. knew people would behave exact way second time around. Technically I’ve preparing since March/April. 

Naive optimism blind faith suddenly become lethal. naturally selected population. used ER vet never wanted crush people pain so, much worse dared give false hope. It’s betrayal, cases haunt most. balancing risk consequences measure.

We absolutely acknowledge schools open increase spread virus. schools closed put undue pressure parents, deprive children social development need.

Those valid concerns, kickabout school really. However, hoped measures collectively reduce spread enough drive virus down.

Now universities... Hmmm. grown adults learning home. Ouch. Nothing hurts feelings worse dumbasses internet thinking friends. ever going get this? They're referring republic Ireland. R number seems stabilized 1 level 3 restrictions finally kicked in. We're level 5 goal get R 0.5 asap get case numbers double digits lower December.

Good luck england.. finished Australia... feels sooooo good.  blithering act, he's also incompetent running country, though job he's trying do. He's trying use right-wing populism satiate childhood ambition ruler, facilitate asset grab wealthy.  anymore. country really full morons top bottom. Nothing ever enforced, people still got grasp basics. Wear mask, wash hands, stay home told. hard. weep future here, I've seen true nature majority people first ticket soon get chance. Would surprised all. polls showing Biden ahead make Republicans go vote. least, expect much closer race polls suggest think pro vaxxers day one leave rest us alone expect cops random though would help get people it. people chance get high fine punishment need individually enforced much. going there?

Anyone involved particular grift going double hard excuse hand catastrophe. seemed work Japan.. far. I'm explaining something needs be, actually right Australia. like it, factually correct. 

The idea think international law could result right show understanding legal system works spreading disinformation. Dunno got info gyms, pubs, restaurants, cinemas, hairdressers etc. closing. updated guidance government's website already. think mildly cautious person would deliveries curb side pickup everything.

You can't go store claim cautious.  Yeah...if cali level infection it’d like 70k+ cases day.  Ha!!! Gotcha beat like 100k. Go America!!! Woooohooooo

Roadhouse.... ""one bad apple"" argument. allow people exist country, allowed take control think ever said elimination. Even current zeros, think expect little fires manageable remaining restrictions contact tracing system cope smaller numbers.

In Victoria 'steps' come lockdown set back July, pre-determined 14-day averages indicators progress next step (such reducing curfew, first thing moderately relaxed - 9pm instead 8pm). ended track those, we're ahead. requirement less 5 daily cases (rolling 14 day average) think X number 'mystery cases' (no connection existing cases). 

Our strict international travel rules make work. Australians, permanent residents immediate relatives enter. enter, go mandatory, supervised hotel quarantine (or military base) 14 days. can't leave country either, except federal government permission handful reasons. Right now, nationwide, cases picked hotels get released society. work. save lives. problems listed solely caused lockdown, maybe exacerbated by, caused by. example, stable, loving parents beginning beat kids they're locked inside. already evil people may more.

""Exacerbated by"" **caused** by. COVID-19 comorbidity &lt;1% fatality rate. make safe? course not. combination COVID old age, obesity, whatever leads death someone might otherwise many years left.

Japan, population almost twice UK, around 1700 deaths UK's 46,000. that's told piss spread disesase, they're told. I'm saying Japan's utopia, got societal problems, least seem able spread lethal pandemic want get haircuit go piss mates. states heavily impacted coronavirus far seem experience partial/temporary herd immunity reach approximately 1 every 2-3,000 people hospitalized. point positive cases start trend relatively quickly.

However, North South Dakota currently trajectory blow past stat reach infection levels achieved CT, MA, NY NJ early pandemic.

I surprised, yet am, two sparsely populated states, seven months pandemic, likely tread infection rates hardest hit densely populated states early on. profoundly stupid. much preferred lockdown summer.

There's unacceptable examples (killing someone donate organs one needy person), kid yourself: absolutely make life death determinations every damn day. aight fortunately vaccines already tried older volunteers Moderna's vaccine shown promise. data this. go store need pick medication, need food. averages twice month.

I actual quarantine shelf things pick up, chilled, sit 3 days minimum. disinfect hands &amp; kitchen table putting stuff that's chilled away. make sure put wallet, keys, purse area usually touch. give shit people say I'm crazy it. I'm negative it. 

I also pick food delivered. find really weird CDC keeps rolling back virus spreads. think getting orders it. Go eat dog turd brainless fuck. time? Yes April vaccination start making us able open even more.

LOL thinks _Belgian government_ able procure distribute vaccine timely manner. Remember facemasks? There’s paywall. Please post article. still wear mask travel work speak patients.

I think state 6 million might new case (singular) today. I'm entirely sure yet. sure, lost enough tests contact tracing. going? means might get choose death send lupus, true. peer reviewed yet, need wait freak out, sure. I'm upset I've spent summer everything could social distance. boyfriend same. Unfortunately job failed made significantly less expected go back old job cook bar recently reopened. Tonight cooking party ""some rich fucks"" put it, bar remains open regular service also. 

Normally works prep shift morning open baby right beginning mess. Since work part time hours making half planned for, return work well unfortunately place willing hire someone many years waitress/cooking experience pizza places another pizza place... despite everything stay home, going groceries necessities, positions get serve selfish people go drink bars eat overpriced appetizers importantly baby risk lose apartment. 

We fucked weeks. feeling spikes among younger groups reason many people seemed practicing social distancing time decided Halloween would fine go say fuck it. You’re proving ignorance. European countries even worst per capital US. Look France Belgium Keeping safe lol, Covid fatality rate kids less flu. John Oliver said this, week great! pray turn better treatment it. Make America Dead Again! US, there's 1 highway. highway hell. Remind me!!!! 42000000069 days Even non-covid world think moderate amount germaphobia better lack it. Would rather weirdo thinks droplets one flu? would rather first. nothing magical surrounded water. US largely surrounded water too. advantage somewhat easier limit travel country countries. traffic coming Mexico Canada driving number cases US. ""Not island"" source problem. fuck point lockdown? way stop spread virus, everything open continue spread. Wear masks, distance best possible ride vaccine ready... Hell probably 300k, essentially half million. Might well round 1 million. Which, large interval, isn’t far 5 million. Could easily round 10 million. 20? We’re looking TWENTY MILLION NEW CASES TOMORROW  Yep, however, Hawaii doing? Kinda. know fomite infection risk low, maybe case her? Seems like two low risk activities. survivors Covid-19 carry worrying signs immune system turned body, reminiscent potentially debilitating diseases like lupus rheumatoid arthritis, new study point, body’s defense system patients shifted attacking itself, rather virus, study suggests. patients producing molecules called “autoantibodies” target genetic material human cells, instead misguided immune response may exacerbate severe Covid-19. may also explain so-called “long haulers” lingering problems months initial illness resolved virus gone bodies.

This first paragraphs article worth reading full. /r/theydidthemath Pretty sure means increased infection rate makes easier test efficacy vaccine.

The way test vaccine give 10s thousands people, half half placebo. Send real world track get sick. drug arm get sick majority time compared placebo arm considered success. infection rate slow, could take year longer, since world decide try murder citizens instead sit home bit data clear earlier date potentially lowering time needed prove efficacy.

Pharma give fuck Trump, put vaccine work, long term businesses, success one vaccine drop bucket drugs working on. 100,000 deaths Christmas. ""again""? US shut first time

but shut january? wholesale like european countries have, could easily see states shutting equivalent. one state makes move others follow. ? R calculated 4 days intervals covid spreads.
The formula c * R^(t/4) = (c+n), solved t. calculators can't take fractional roots, using ln workaround.

* / calculated left-to-right, (ln(n+c/c)/ln(R))*4 US incompetent administration care people. Try open windows can. Yeah, know gonna get cold. purpose hysteria? infectious disease like flu, case fatality rate lower 1% IFR less 0.01%. country accidentally eliminated virus

Y'all flexing rest us now! Awesome job 👍 thanks! Remind me! 10 days verdict nothing works (see Sweden) r u ok? NZ: 15 people per square kilometre 
UK: 275 people per square kilometre 

NZ population: 4.8 million 
Uk population: 66.6 million

Closest major country NZ: Australia 4157.41 KM away

Closet major country UK: France 33KM away. 

Sure Jacinda popular, need realistic here. talking r/sino right? I've platform long enough remember created. Basically r/china notoriously anti-China, much bunch people basically left created sub counter shit spewing, time echo chamber grew become radical eventually became type shit r/China opposite rhetoric. literally watched ""trump train"" texas blocked biden bus driving highway. Wtf people? like car show without fast nice cars instead big trucks many flags fit flapping it? cant understand it. [the could 1 million fatalities early next year. BREAKING NEWS: driving Barnard Castle becomes nation wide test literally anything. hope US comes senses reconsiders lockdown; I’m South Florida cruise ships coming back tomorrow bars open. It’s insane Given username, like football, like politics. thought gave context, sorry felt didn't. Barely anyone even dressed up. waste. heartbreaking. Wow wear mask still got it? Imagine that. funny thing pretty similar situation US federal government completely washed hands left solely states accomplish. miss store interactions much. We're delivery only, partner WFH 10-month-old baby, people around. Plenty physical contact.

But different getting see new faces. Compliment someone's lipstick haircut. Complain mildly checkout person something.

No one gets see cute baby give compliments accept vicariously!

Ugh.

Anyway, try walking around neighborhood around time every day! might start recognize dog walkers wave even cross street avoid direct path.

Plus, extra bit sunlight super helpful waning light months towards winter.  Living Melbourne come 3 month hard lockdown . would say going locked winter time . would much harder us summer everyone wants . Get good food , put heating cosy front tv play games . UK know miserable winters get therefore easier right thing stay home . pay back? like print back. Rofl. No, think person saying parents want what's best child, like normal loving parents do.

Yes parents benefit able send kids ""daycare"" 7-8 hours every weekday daycare. Parents want what's best child shown virtual school young kids, (Kindergarten grade school) work. critical time development decent parent would concerned that.

Maybe re-opening schools bad idea, something else needs happen imo. Virtual school needs either revamped ditched alternative.

That's take non parent Oh yeah I’ll rushing get vaccine. Not. Couldn’t find time beers read two paragraph isolated showing symptoms. state tested nearly everyone camp ... None cases fatal even serious, CDC reported, one Aug. 11, CDC said, everyone camp cleared travel back home. I’m also NW burbs saw coming kept kids remote. Hybrid lasted week return remote. Nearly everyone legitimate reason, (symptoms, close contact positive case) already tested usual way, hospital pcr test. agree that, definitely last part. still think though might cautious ya know ? chance (considering phase 3 vaccine success rate 86% so) vaccine three we're counting failing less 0.1%. think eventually vaccine roll we'll around Q2 next year, agree social distancing best practice now. \+957 cases, 972 patients discharged.

Why fuck stop counting 957 Everybody gets quarantine fatigue. That's remind act selfishly, nurses doctors suffer.

So far, 1200 healthcare employees died US treating Covid patients. ones dead exhausted mentally fried.

Dr. Claire Rezba documenting deaths healthcare workers died COVID-19 here: look rest Europe think find science seems agree reality question successful lockdown is. (hint: countries went lockdown go lockdown again) Everything online uni year. Please keep mind original warning came April, although article posted. first I’ve heard Tumeric echinacea detrimental, though. Anyone newer, good info supplements? cross road eyes closed. die, die. backed data ""Our World Data"" - Number deaths countries covered article last 30 Slovak language, interested, gallery photos taken yesterday Slovakia testing places: don’t think courtesy. It’s necessity now.
After pandemic won’t need masks common flu cold. 
Otherwise one would build immunity lesser illnesses.

But that’s two cents. Yeah, many people trust vaccine anyway. I’m Canada, massive number people talk (fully agree non-scientific method) claim refuse vaccine years it’s proven safe (in minds)

After months months restrictions given high risk nothing happens probably break take it. Please. It’s like complete opposite Costco, even Texas people wearing mask Costco. strange Texas Sounds good, then:  
AstraZeneca guys right? ""AstraZeneca exempt coronavirus vaccine liability claims countries"". think I'll pass personally really, really hope mandatory. end pandemic vaccinate at-risk people healthcare workers tbh see anti-vax man (I'm sure there's enough) thought France Germany keeping open Please translate American please. going produce lot interesting data. going reconfirm every positive case PCR test? people saying worked 9/11, hurricane Katrina, etc., covid worse.

That's problem media. fail deliver message Covid became like daily catastrophic event. like get several 100 patients care maximal attention. get 50 first day 70 second day 100 third day constantly full capacity. Even Covid get health care workers good chance mental stress will. many jobs effectively performed remotely yet workers still going office (like me). unnecessary risk almost reward. believe 14 days recommended quarantine someone may infected people develop symptoms within 14 days. 

If already tested positive probably longer infectious 10 days. countries borders. UK could done easily. Hasn’t shown protests little spread disease? Purely anecdotal everyone masked ones I’ve attended. figured would active cases googled active case stats, found confirmation. Besides would people fell cracks somehow. think maybe getting confused terms mean context study. AI program wearable forming prediction currently covid, study prediction 80% accurate. diagnosis, showing 80% likelihood would diagnosed tested. None measures enforced. Chicago required 14-day quarantine people like 30 states, one airport corralling people flights making quarantine. 

All hear lockdowns, quarantines, contact tracing bunch things aren’t actually done they’re logistically impossible. It’s ridiculous. people stop claiming can't breathe wearing mask? shadow longer you, cannot make vitamin D.

UVB needed make it, rays bounce ozone layer angle sun 45 degrees. already questioned earlier thats australia new zealand wel WINTER. hole ozone layer. might give ability make Vitamin winter sun.

I see lot commercials promoting vitamin even shower UVB light Netherlands, companies see opportunity government slow.  ... often, *may* come ""who more-likely survive."" would take private enterprise point. I’ve given federal government. Jab already would probably better, easy situation. lockdown means killing part economy, lot restrictions people etc. hard take action right time. don’t hate masks. wear mine faithfully. well area. one wants jeopardize it. false. confirmed reinfections, sequenced virus time, confirmed people infected two different strains, meaning actually infected twice.

Edit: downvoting this? said 100% factual. I'm one claiming supposed reinfections real, OP one claiming artifacts. person forum 2002 used 'socialised daycare' refer public school system. Given many schools kids graduate &amp; need re-learn (or even learn 1st time) high school stuff college, makes sense now. Since pandemic shutdowns began March, thought popped head 'socialised daycare' thing, society need really think full purpose school. academic side trying handled via Zoom, &amp; people years insisted school 1st &amp; foremost academics, kind complaints seeing lately schools? academic slippage/regression, course. email says ""A point keeping schools open would progress faster herd immunity"" 14/3 promptly moved secondary higher education remote learning entire Sweden. consistent, right? **Discussion**

In small crossover study, wearing 3-layer nonmedical face mask associated decline oxygen saturation older participants. Limitations included exclusion patients unable wear mask medical reasons, investigation 1 type mask only, Spo2 measurements minimal physical activity, small sample size. results support claims wearing nonmedical face masks community settings unsafe. We’ve open since end August (RED) midwestern state substantial (extremely high actually) community spread. state university too.

We 3 elementary schools, 1 intermediate, 1 middle, 1 high school. 

We’ve closures limited positive cases. going full time full capacity minimal distancing. catch - students staff required wear masks times. 

I’m teacher one upper age schools one child Elementary. sad nobody written one voievodship hit 96% positive ration time ago. 


And system handle 60k tests daily, means, situation much much worse Except judge case head county government isnt hearing cases. judge impact law enforcement he's presiding excessive force trials 

Around 100k Americans died ww1 run City Chicago Cook County. one fall Pritzker. believe English speaking channel. Shame me? I’m allowed put little ones masks classroom although wear bus common areas. choice. comes Department Education. care provided matter what.

Quick ""life saving care"" typically rendered, matter ... sustained day-to-day care may be, sorts situations (ie. People ""sent home"" hospital longer space house them). clarify way kind lockdown had. another person saying ""strict lockdown"". term still ambiguous. So, saying responsible organization would engage planning, reviews wargaming iron kinks dealing possible future events, rather throw prior plans, hire golfing buddies important roles, generally run around like chickens heads cut off? sounds revolutionary.  mind Zero Covid means elimination. Close borders, close everything till gone completely (or TTI'd oblivion). support fully.

However charter outlines. attempts put political spin absolutely (and ruthlessly) technocratic response.

We already 'People's Assembly' - called Parliament.

Also centered text pain read. travel ban irritates much. aks quarantine traveling state daily case rate 15/100,000. made sense summer, states list mostly quarantine Illinois travelers, way around. triage. ""combat triage"" different thing. I’m arguing, don’t read German. 

Yea see peak, years lines superimposed mean? Despite draw downs troops overseas, military medicine largely maintained hospitals clinic presence still need resources Golden hour away safely wage war.

CoVID19 makes worse quarantines along transportation network deploys reploys troops.

There little spare capacity military medicine step help handful hospitals.

You didn’t hear much, summer long military using nearly spare capacity FEMA deployments handful states.

Add crunch travel docs/nurses due high demand everywhere reinforcements country.  Yes, happens mortality rates people ignore scourge much grows teeming monster hospitals longer handle. Sounds like catch line real cheesy thriller movie. part chose leave context, making statement disingenuous. heartbroken mother revealed Connor never got 'hardship' contracting coronavirus forced spend 20 weeks 'harsh' lockdown China. 

The differences chinese lockdown wuhan 16 weeks vs open lockdown UK Australia stark. endured lockdown anyone even known - 16 weeks harsh lockdown Wuhan, two weeks Australia three weeks UK.

So, weeks UK Australia mandatory quarantine time 4 weeks due travel. Yes July, 4 months Europe. July Europe happening right Victoria : end lockdown, spring/summer season. stupid compare France example second big outbreak autumn season shit weathers. Australia lagging behind.

Not forget confirmed cases Europe november/december 2019 outbreak started right beginning winter season hope understand outbreak Europe nowhere near happened Australia far harder manage. gargle cask strength scotch 3 times day fine.

""A scotch 3 times day keep covid away""

:-)  That's kind poor excuse though. countries could learned Liberia without ebola epidemic themselves. Speaking Canadian, total hypocrites times. look America lot superiority complex many cases, we're really much better. Im glad Champaign however GOD DAMN CHAMPAIGN HIGH HOPES US see peak bottom, specifically drawn show effect COVID? arguing with? No. Germany, populated EU country, 1/4 population US. Absolutely nobody talking case numbers EU whole. Kinda forgot Ford county round  Social people suffering due staying home conversing online much suffering go adhering keto diet. Facemasks uncomfortable, there's way around it. Especially someone wears glasses: I've switched contact lenses can't stand facemask + glasses, fucking horrible. stop wearing facemasks pandemic still going on... can't wait us beat covid stop wearing them.

(Note live US, means beating covid lifetime possibility) U.S is, think third fourth testing. Africa lowest infection rate anyone? ""experts"" said poorer sanitation vitamin deficiency yet whole continent relatively ok compared everyone else.

They take hydroxychloroquine suppress human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) replication vitro cells monocytes inhibiting post-transcriptional modification virus. also take prevent Malaria. 

Trump took well seem sick all. Dr li ming yan chinese whistleblower also recommended it. Maybe need study canada 37 million people 3000/day certificate card two weeks thing. Honestly, people would comply tried anything longer. Lmao you’re actually lying head local law enforcement agency, unless wanted arrestees' cases dismissed officers' excessive force cases proceed, I'd judge says. Yes, know. definitely economic issue. Spain already high unemployment rate. relatively poor compared Germany, France UK. refer BBC news organizations receive public funds managed governments ""state media""? You’re fucking idiot know immune system works many different cells besides CD 8 Cytotoxic cells kill infected cells. CD4 ones also essential part adaptive immune response. Read immunology idiot That’s POINT united every state considered separately, especially big ones land barriers like California Texas sound like antimasker yikes sounds like good idea applying quite redditors ;) agree. Even recovered virus, mocked people wearing masks. He’s big believer science doesn’t include doctors scientists anymore.
Just pray away we’ll fine, it’s working well! Yea except people going bars restaurants private parties we’ve made successful vaccines animal Coronaviruses, good idea aim cannons Spike. provides framework responsible people follow. friend Florida wanted come NY put mandatory 14 day quarantine. enforceable? really especially drive in. people still change behavior. reinfections people sort immune system issues?   really seen much information topic, asking. Yes long? year good bet year enough think countries go winter drive infections it’s shown virus spreads indoors people likely stay indoors cold. Australia good winter cases going winter low winter, country, nowhere near cold countries. *most people social nature could us stopped testing days bunch tracing works manageable case loads, that's case Europe.

Many European countries low amount cases summer. cases started increasing, tracing failed nothing done. less half tests. missing many cases CA. Maybe better educated would know affected countries Europe experienced hard lockdown well Victoria. Doubt choose live like dumb fuck, I’d accept dumb fuck consequences. COVID19 cancer herpes. 

That’s called adult. happened El Paso? major type manufacturing requires close proximity others? Kind like slaughter houses certain states middle nowhere huge outbreaks? Anti vaxxer lol. need slap label don’t agree me. I’m saying don’t want something injected body numbers prove it. used bunch people proven work, I’ll happy take it. don’t desire inject substances body without certainty won’t harm way. millions people get vaccine works I’d love take it. certainly don’t want first 5% people get doesn’t work/causes complications, that’s unnecessary risk. yeah never said people shouldn’t get first. want to. I’m sharing opinion think right time take people call “antivaxxer” lol. Get grip stop assuming things. used treat HIV President Dwayne Elizondo Mountain Dew Herbert Camacho, that’s who. Whelp, think done here. Think lives could saved kept tent idea long. 200k+ dead Americans, tell us ;) hope joke poor taste.

OP's lost sense taste.

EDIT: Sorry That’s correct all. USA follows testing system EU (ie stages - III release public). may different ideas acceptable efficacy right decide. case Oxford vaccine decided reviewing data time stage three trials running. Canada is, EU is, USA isn’t. Nancy Pelosi came load old bollocks standards basis reality. mean Tegnell's words said strategy. ""Safe"" building herd immunity Sweden via viral exposure. read quote deny it?

If goal suppression earth talking seroprevalence herd immunity much? Yeah get data could different. They're saying 13% Cases skyrocketed live around 2 weeks opening schools. officials trying blame young adults partying? lol give break. trump told go Russia Today. F that. still break China starts even that. doctors know hospitals full hallways filled people waiting bed, longer send sick patients there. probably something happened French nursing homes back March. Getting sick blatantly ignoring health protocols.

Everyone get treated prioritize actually make effort situation people need prioritized.

Insurance work way, cases does. still place.  completely true. work. worst parts March April Tegnell Giesecke obsessing incorrect immunity numbers. Nothing thanks weak effort. Except unnecessary deaths.

Actually thanking Swedish private companies really encouraging work home FHM slow doubtful (""but equality"") better. Strong push work home among good things coming Sweden. still here? 

**Follow social mitigation guidelines issued local federal health authorities.** 

It isn’t difficult concept parse. 

Guidelines may basic principles cannot exactly everywhere planet isn’t homogeneous, governed one state. 

Do *seriously* get that? Don’t answer; it’s rhetorical. Well that’s true result lot people practice social distancing? something special el paso? Incubation period  Sorry Wisconsin's GOP legislatures vacation year convene shut kind mandate regards pandemic. far Las Cruces Albuquerque I’m actually happy upvotes comment outweighed downvotes! Whats fitness level heartrate thats normally 50s?

My resting heart rate always around mid 60s low 70s. Lol Indeed. However lockdown necessary, measures need taken spread load widely fairly. possible, would lose course try block measures. No, think nearly impossibly difficult trace specific pockets disease outbreak event occurred almost two months ago. Yes, Sturgis spread disease bunch people traveled home brought respective cities, think there's enough data point trace North Dakota's outbreak Sturgis. jhu site state previous week positivity rate teens. loud, vocal minority.

The best part call silent majority, hilarious (and subtitle punk rock song called *Abolish Government*).

This fascism dies, loudly indignantly. Keep fighting good fight. Less population yes, people live capital cities. Population density majority Australians live quite high. primarily suburban."
