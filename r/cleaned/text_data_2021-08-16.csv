0,2021-08-16," first two numbers 7 days missing? data painfully clear vaccines much much much safer getting covid. line argument disingenuous misguided. sure which… either way I’m confident even 30 years won’t close million people die vaccines. Dumb ass covidiots.  Nice cops die public facing professions? want insert agenda?  No, means tested. sucks say drew short straw. McDonald's gas station employees required pay tip bussers, back house, bartenders whether pay tip not.

Is shitty situation? Yeah. tipping means cost someone money wait you.


If got problem tip culture, stop eating sit restaurants. all, going effect pay increase continuing give employers make staff rely tips money anyways.


Otherwise principled. cheapskate rationalizing yourself. Oh, hell, lowered intelligence + possible COVID psychosis going shitty combination deal with. :(  Every vaccine came new card. lost it, got vaccinated place, would e re-issue ppl didn’t need second. sure worked got vaccinated different location second dose. I’m assuming pull patient records live hurricanes getting prepared trying avert serious crisis best can. fails, usually due human folly, hurricane itself. People wear one mask seem eager take others. It’s probably toddlers aww gross, parents can’t leave toddlers alone rest bed sick. normalise amount time spent close contact.  highly unlikely get car accident given car trip. better believe put seatbelts get moving. Yes do. Look requirements French Polynesia, Spain, South Africa etc. flying home sketchy part. US requires negative test get back. lot tourist get stranded . quarantine country. 20 right French Polynesia. vaccinated too. body starts emitting 5G giving people 10 ft radius +3 saving throw vs COVID done math children? 

No one wants lose child… way folks(and news) danger absolutely ridiculous. wish bought shit ton super fast tests 80% accurate, made vaccine + test entrance. Great! vaccine kids 12? work healthcare, double mask wear face shield, plus outer protective layer? able transmit you?

What kind tests done inflammatory markers? thought x-rays CT scans show inflammation tissue damage. That's okay. Everyone knows long haulers people already COVID, chronic illness. pieces enough anyone understand. become Covid love Israel ? Yeah we've known toddlers sneeze face thousands years, that's gross. need buy food restaurant? No. decent share us relapse.  one arguing right thing do. going happen. No. know germs thousands years. actually pretty recent discovery.   folks said, patients hallways regular reality parts country long befor Covid-19.

Pre-COVID spent 15 hours ER hallway, witnessed man code die, try unobtrusive family came back stand right feet grieving. night left little PTSD.

And ***before*** pandemic! regular Friday night Charlotte-area ER. A) doesn’t anyone ask kids want care? poor kids mercy parents trying kill them? B) exactly poor kids going like grow parents? Oh no, ridiculously generalizing statement sea lion. I'm crushed. Cops never respond calls like Lot words think summarize opinion: 

Masks effective personally are, many reasons pointless keep focusing on. 

The almost religious fervor either side mask argument absurd alarming especially juncture pandemic.

Politics apparently pandemic policy science. problem. Enjoy true patriot neighbors. Provided aren’t fat course. Let know ever make eugenics dreams reality  community spread Hawaii.  Tourists vaccinated negative tests.  handful tourists... people people getting vaccinated Brooklynite, present hearty thumbs action taken city Gov’t scared kid good reason. 6yo get hospitalized contacting covid? Yes. extremely unlikely? Yes. Typical American. Always complaining one educated turns nose people ask educated. ironic self-fulfilling prophecy.  Sounds awful lot like social; security numbers, lol. 369 officers died *all year, total, across entire United States* 2020. 240 Covid. group needs stop complaining dangerous jobs lmao fake vax cards popular, wonder well works. needles big name US vaccines tend smaller. Son large fear needles. Wife took mom person giving told fear. supposedly shook little fear. needle.being small initial injection bad like some. Aka.some.you feel liquid injected quick. remember called shot affect usually. feel lump maybe word later. 
Now die injections MRI etc fun. bad scale mRNA vaccines simple. Let person know like shots. talked son giving looking. quick jab done. 
Like.said scale.of bad shots low. Words still hurt though hollow head mate? Sounds like someone needs tell works. Yes minimum wage workers call heroes pay expected enforce this. don’t think need test negative vaccinated masks social distancing deemed ineffective measures?

Ineffective? No, they're enough either. Flu cases 2020 2021 decreased DRAMATICALLY. day heard news reported deaths flu last winter, country (I live Europe). shows much transmissible sars-cov2 influenza (for insisting flu). Ironically, followed good news saying expect worrisome wave flu cases fully ditch masks social distancing restrictions, since less people caught last year, less people form immunity/protection it, urging people (specially elderly feeble) get flu shot - far less effective COVID shots, still highly disparity mortality rates well latest stats re: waning antibodies transmissibility, vaccine mandates truly required keeping people safe?

Again, far deadlier flu (even restrictions social distancing) importantly **far taxing clinics hospitals**!! Small pox worse suddenly make Covid good, less bad (but still pretty fucking bad).
And waning antibodies mean vaccines noneffective. immune system memory, vaccines train immune system fight infection future much quicker never got shot. subsequently faster immune system responds less severe said infection be.

Your entire post implying vaccines simply needed without saying straight away (to avoid called anti-vaxxer?), picking scaremongering arguments without context giving depth actually mean.

Either anti-vaxxer, troll thinks funny spreading disinformation thread clearly need it.  vaccinated necessarily stop catching spreading

It prevents strong majority people needs do. Vaccination slows transmission. 

What's happening currently questioning Delta variant whether vaccines help enough it. know help least somewhat, there's still benefits enforcing vaccinations. Think we'll see senators flee states there's one left exploit?  6yo understands danger gets vaccinated. relying lot estimates assumptions. scenario seems plausible, that's say. really safe. would rushed lost control life, endangering around you, careful let spiral wildly control, say, ""Who fuck cares?"". 


We're global deadly pandemic made worse deadly idiots morons, can't something drink now, you?

Infectious disease outbreaks new thing cruise ships never know full extent ships fly flags countries extremely lax laws. Cruise ship companies scourge Earth.  evidence it’s transmitted mosquitos. likely infected domesticated pet interacting wildlife.   Government keeps capitalism check, often times goes nature capitalism benefit citizens.

In original comment calling capitalism self-regulation. many things country government allows businesses, corporations, private institutions regulating authority, privacy concerns online advertising education two examples.

As redditors already pointed you, effective government makes happen, capitalism helps it’s sole contributing factor make seem. Unfortunately yes….my question genius health officials messaging is….a weeks ago mask mandates came back NoLa. said vaccine doesn’t protect others….so put mask back on. 
Now say even though vaccine doesn’t protect others need prove vaccinated others indoors. WTF??? trying save point? different cigarette soda taxes. Glad self righteous authoritarianism holes charge! Since stopped street vendors selling illegal goods? might care... overall ppl vaccinated policy... maybe get delta Submission data FDA put me. think anything gets approved. hate say 50% vax rural county isn’t bad.

I‘d call phenomenal looking country (Switzerland). We‘re barely hitting 50% fully vaccinated progress stagnating now.

Fucking travesty us, don‘t mean throw shade people living rural regions US, would expected something else. means decided  Well, clearly figured out. Let's go see attitude working Florida. Oh no. Florida approx 1100 deaths per week 151,942 new infections per week.


Let take look I'm located. got 70% vaccination rate (for first shot) back June. I'm 11x less death rate 8x less infection rate Florida.

I guess ok people killing rate ~4700 per week Florida alone. number rising week though btw. What's max number deaths per week say ,""ok, that's much""?

If get that, know get head. got vaxxed two different counties? actually got first vax one state second another state. Biden's major dissapointment issue, sadly  Seems southern state thing. start school Labor Day west coast (US). Labor Day first weekend September. us going eventually die , first time sick one times Covid adding health issues time .

It people refuse mask vaccinate decide , eventually go away big issue .

Only day bother wearing N95 masks going eat outdoor gathering? would've likely better wearing cheap surgical masks eating around people. feel like someone else said too. they're ""virtually immune."" people talk diseases like polio measles eradicated, lot people forget mention high uptake vaccines. definitely get low rates measles half eligible population vaccinated! That’s Canadians only, bub.  they'll go jail caught signed back first came wasnt good choice since pretty well isolated. understand take. could hold continue wearing mask etc kids 12 vaccinated would awesome. Louisiana, Covid Vaccines reported Health Department, access via [LA app free everyone state access driver's license vaccine information. Seriously made option County, fortunately Governor put mandate place right b4 school started, parents fighting it, sending kids School maskless anyway. Less week School year, 2 full classes qaurintined. I'm it. part ""freedom"", it? 

(I knew recognized name somewhere 😉) taking timing account too? find exact new policy LiveNation website find references test done 2-3 days prior event. That's likely that's turnaround time PCR test accurate rapid antigen tests. incubation short 2 days, getting test 3 days prior (within policy) going spreader event kind afterwards would ""perfect storm"" bypass policy completely.

Is stretch? Absolutely. mean impossible though.  year really looking like wants take title away last. Look key writing.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Whoa really amazing description. point, probably thinks reversing course would put bad light. tossing people lions care.
I'm wondering state legislature power boot him, mindless zombies? Gotcha. would absolutely take flu hospitalizations/deaths US flu season set over/under ""like previous years"" maybe 2015-2019 average. reason, many people wear masks throughout flu season. yet. I’m mobile frankly can’t arsed Ok, ""we can't go eat **ever**y again?"" dramatic. gets vaccine. 

You also live New York City. general vicinity Passaic County New Jersey, still hour away city. So, like can't eat indoors local. can't go city it. 

It would really bad idea anyway go indoor restaurant unvaccinated health. seems reckless even consider dining indoors going indoor events given concern safety child; risk picking virus giving child?

The vaccine transfer baby mentioned. Antibodies may. *reports* could even find breastfed babies negative reactions mothers vaccinated handful social media posts (a even debunked news medical sites). CDC recommends people aged 12 years older, including people breastfeeding receive vaccine. Also, pregnant recently pregnant people likely get severely ill COVID-19 compared non-pregnant people. 

This seems like non-issue making issue. literally fix *problem* within 24 hours. stick plan get vaccinated summer. Thanks link, data indeed bad news. I'll still call Hero. Eff accusers, bunch losers. Whats positivity rate? vaccine   Excellent! employees contractors required wear mask inside NPS buildings even crowded outdoor spots

Makes sense, already camping. thinking thing:”dump doorstep. I’m cool that!” Can't cases can't tests. least they're good something Freshly squeezed Pennsylvania lockdown right now?

Can leave house? fear kids... 7 year old's school north GA 55 cases first 2 weeks school :( Country point even VOC. Maybe read bit more. Less 1% cases sequenced US Lambda. Delta overwhelming fitness advantage...

'The Centers Disease Control Prevention keeps list variants concern interest within United States. Notably, lambda CDC's list variant interest, concern high consequence.'

Straight CDC.... dunno you’re downvoted chances outdoor transmission negligible Seriously, want ask exactly thinks got immune system from, mailman? nurse support this. 

However, say don’t know single unvaccinated nurse. know grumbled fact pharmaceutical companies given immunity liability vaccine injury. honestly, think fair gripe, still got shots. 

Also “nurses” spreading anti-vaxx crap aren’t really nurses, they’re CNAs hospital staff. 

Obviously, I’m saying anti-vaxx nurses don’t exist, absolutely do, think it’s fair pull license actively spreading information goes public health guidelines. Nurses giving medical advice anyway - cost license right there. husband like gonna ""second shot appointment? actually getting fourth shot right?"" (Since said first shot make schedule once) I'm like I'm planning tempt tho lol Anyone CT this? covered insurance? look state system? I'm at, fringe Chicago metro area surrounding rural stretches, bigger are, anti-mask/anti-vaccine are... Thats good point. seems weird anyone traveling place place, effectively making potential super spreader, would exempt. anything would think essentially long distance coronavirus delivery service, would mean would even heavier restrictions most. Lol.

I wonder eBay. really detest COVID pandemic; like immediately highlights bad policy. something dumb? 6 weeks later crystal clear implemented dumb policy. Dumb ads killer Soooooo. 

I live Florida, positivity rate county 28.5%. husband works high risk environment one vaccinated. Covid making rounds past couple weeks. We've spared (so far), school started going get worse gets better. 

Would dangerous reckless us go get booster CDC gives ok general public? I've reading CVS really loosey goosey checking credentials. know got first dose -- check ID doctor's note (we got first doses March available gen pop FL).

Morally, would best shots went countries need them, tell sitting going waste part state. say it. sucks people physically unfit vaccine benefits long term, want another two three years shit people wont get vaccinated. give idiots platform TV give dangerous opinions? hell basically remove viable hosts path disease.

Sounds eerily like fighting wildfires. Gen Pop. sounds weird context. best screenshot dude told ""I'm putting something body made 9 months"", kid not, went post history, first post ever something like ""I can't stop giving oral random dudes"". TL;DR:

Metro Nashville schools continue require masks, despite state governor attempting overthrow mask mandate.   Guess I'm going NYC again.

Sucks everyone wants get vaccine something I've already had. Neither, that's relapse chronic illness. sources? I'm looking scientific analysis discusses whether strains spread easily tend less deadly matters US vaccinated later. Immunity wanes time, unfortunately quite quickly. stay fuck home! parks miss you. Yes sick this. Argued nutritionist spreading anti-vaxx misinformation FB yesterday. babbies formed patients hers... blame you. Servers bartenders take much abuse. June great July good August looks like November. Delta curve ball way transmittable. R° still well 1 we're still rising. Hopefully peaks likely need vaccinated get there. Hence policy Somewhere know there's someone shots. wonder many have. Free access vaccine coupled pandemic causing severe stress mental health issues... people probably glowing Oh, keep seeing fake vaccine card pics/posts? else required? used work someone Iran. One nicest, hard working people I've ever met. exiled Iran spoke government. know that's easy place live heart actually hurts people suffering respiratory viruses returned near-normal levels, flu expected spread again. Getting #fluvaccine fall best way protect family would assume would like previous years, extra spice covid top it. Hospitals going dealing surges once, going nasty.


Also infected time. Slim chances, always got flu shot anyways year got asap. Rand Paul? words deep. Oooooooooooooooooof. feel dood. Stay safe. Ha. Ten year bartender here. Quitting job tomorrow. It’s hard enough arguing fools put mask on, I’m supposed check vaccine cards along picture ID? know hard people push back showing ID they’re clearly overrage? people I’m arguing with, pissing off, probably asking conform leave ones decide I’m worth tip not? source income, since hourly well minimum wage. Yeah right. Good luck staffing restaurants now. beyond absurd. Well way. state put sign window verifies business submitted vaccination records employees, put sign window verify business met food health standards. they're required check undocumented immigrants staff. Sure catch everybody, instituting deterrent lot risky try ignore rules.  Seriously. evidence-based medical procedures agree with? 78% population vaccinated that’s hardly surprising.

Look disparities death rates US Kaiser Family Foundation. You’ll find vaccinated folks 1/6 less chance dying. That's lot people probably thoughts prayer nurse much.  Code blue - crashing - body stops working - actively dying  long doesn’t take too-young-to-be-vaxxed kid… ""up 95%"" mean? Like that's upper end confidence interval? never thought would say but... I'm proud Atlanta Falcons!

Also I'm amazed they're team NFL 100% vaccinated. Euro dude here.

This US forum, global forum.

This absolutely right time talking this.

In Europe publicly talking since March 2020, likely outcome end Cold, Flu Covid season every year.

This means needing get vaccinated every year winter hits us.

You also talking mutant variants Delta hit, way could prepared properly reduced risk, didn't.

You also talking recombinant events.

If COVID happens infect wrong bat camel Middle East possible combine MERS virus produce novel coronavirus spreads like COVID kills like MERS.

That would bad. 37.5% fatality rate bad. Billions dead bad.

So vaccinating everyone near cities MERS know exist animal populations sending staff sequencers areas detect track MERS much better moment.

But talking possibility, taken action prevent outcome. really idea people thinking good news. I’m sorry, booster shots mean need get real efficacy vaccine.

I’ve fully vaccinated since April. vaccinated people life acting like pandemic over.

The vaccines work better could hoped, need acknowledge less effective time.

The anti-vaxxers lost cause. CDC needs prioritize timely transparent data vaccinated. Especially comes long Covid. restaurants essential. go grocery store make food get take out. person replied allowed post me? said child better parents dead. Wtf. got second dose early January. arm ready. 3 months, move 6 months. Umm, no, cops pull ask drivers license time want, lot, happens occasionally people still get drivers licenses...

&amp;#x200B;

They ask ID youre breaking law underage drinking... know again, ask suspect underage drinking, commonly restaurant bar owners know get closed fuck ever let underage people drink bars, restaurants bars ask ID youre obviously 30+

God people even touch grass, go outside? anyone even drink drive? want things happen you, go move bumfuck wilderness Alaska. know. almost feel cheated thing got dying hospitalized Covid. No, vaccine. developers behind vaccine might explored option, vaccine still effective known strains. ""My rights arent restricted support it"" 

Well fucking duh That's December me....I'll take one though. Already 3rd shot scheduled tomorrow CVS. make easy sign it. got 2nd shot end March. Time start classifying fake vaccine cards like opioids. Thank voice reason thread. kept reading thinking one questioning this. Yes, get vaccinated, practice safety measures, really know third booster? risk vaccine shot

what risk.  laugh people compare Nazis WWII. matter thinking masks help prevent spread illness not. forcing millions people wear mask everywhere rest lives worth tradeoff. I’m sorry hear that. Hope get quickly. many months second dose? It’s 4 months me. wanted get third dose tell elderly friends big deal &amp; shouldn’t wait CDC recommendation. What's efficacy Modern vaccine new Delta variant? also unlikely large impact. think get shot vs risking jail buy fake card agree. I'm vaccinated refuse wear mask longer. mandate live, ignore it.  can't let run. think guys fully comprehending hospital situation. People need surgeries gonna get told get bent months months end sight, people non covid related anything going die preventable shit. mention covid shit basically driving health care workers brink. Good luck running hospital everyone decides say fuck shit.   much like 9/11 loss privacy 

as walk around phone broadcasting location, able turned listen time. way slow virus rewarding thing slows virus. Ppl tired masks makes sense use reward system. Also keeps businesses open gets real bad again. perfect makes alot sense. local school mentioned article, masks optional schools mitigation last year place. Almost one wears masks. opted virtual least that. Yes indeed. Aches fever/chill within ~8 hours. I'm going get every single vaccine sun, Pfizer J&amp;J Astra Zeneca even Sputnik V 3 China have. much protection anyone within 10 foot radius protected COVID, cured virus repelled me.  feel like kids 12 still going doctors yearly check ups.

I one kids doctor annual check Doctor said routine visits immunizations much expecting significant measles outbreak near future. sure got antagonistic there. going like flu was. Except probably worse overall top flu cold things. like said people going like flu get sick days move on. yes, also going like flu society sucks allowing people stay home sick people go work instead. yeah, going continue spread mutate vaccine improvements worked on. Like article person saying, going go away. I’d take 5 cents gallon fill up. 😆  understanding vaccinated prevent anyone contraction spreading virus. 

So actions others put less danger. vaccine purely reduce symporms.

This unlikely wearing mask essentially works group effort wear one maintains proper social distancing. getting real tired data shot got... nearly scary prions.  It’s though, one: “Long Covid” poorly defined, two: there’s ton useful data Long Covid unvaccinated vaccinated groups. 

But least one study found maybe 1/5 symptomatic breakthrough cases lingering symptoms (no definition meant.) tracking asymptomatic cases. 

That’s garbage data. 

Continue take precautions wouldn’t worry much beyond that. Fuck tipping. Pay proper wage instead. small number. want stop living life based odds, go ahead. me. counted proof exactly? enforcing it? Restaurant hostess, security, bouncers, waitress, random police coming restaurant? Jesus Christ.   Yeah.. suspected committing crime violation… break another law age drinking. Sure. shot #4? problem I've ever mask child always wants wear fpp2s, even go hiking middle nothing, cause beautiful turquoise blue lmao Personally, I'm vaccinated I'm done masks. ever said 40? certain conditions probably, absolutely closer 90 40 general. 

Regardless, even was, interpretation still make sense. think claim booster means 100% effective? That's still wrong would 2.5x increase, 250% 3.5x increase, vaccine would need less 28% effective even possible, obviously wrong.

It's obvious bad data presentation. I'd bet money numbers closer suggested, we'll see soon. 2021 far either. less deadly situation vaccine, dude. unvaccinated people dying 20:1 vaccinated, we're still losing 600 day, think puts us vaccine exist? Come on. would great news weren’t needed first place.

This isn’t great news. Okay, basically wishing death me. 

That's nothing new, people since beginning pandemic. membership among make popular. still makes immoral ethically questionable prioritize notion someone's freedom actual life another. 

But dehumanization arguments acceptable now, expect immune ""natural selection"" takes place. There's always someone low end bell curve, tomorrow you. I’m curious well, first dose Pfizer made feel worse second, I’m anxious booster work me. thing gonna peak soon what? keep hearing gonna peak soon, weeks gone cases still going up.

I've felt worse I've felt years day. Moderna joke. Death rates gotta least 10% more. I’m talking convincing people. feeling ones reached change minds kids get sick.

Of course can't zero cases forever, can't let circulate level much, much higher vaccination rates. Please let us know goes Thanks response. hope able get booster soon vaccinated co-workers recover. Dude really got around huh? stunning rate cases per million. Shit. need this. CVS administering 3rd shots valid reason nothing stopping someone lying. ask basic questions nothing more. ask basic 3 questions sick.

I need schedule either second dose extra dose (for patients weakened immunity)

You click continue choose either Pfizer Moderna enter date 2nd shot.

After enter zip code, choose location pick date/time.

You enter name/address/phone number/DOB continue ask insurance answer 13 yes/now/I know questions it.

So yes anyone lie get 3rd shot. valid reason getting mine blame anyone lie shot 6 months ago high risk works around unvaccinated people. Yea I’ll put money COVID vaccine annual shot like influenza.  certainly crazy/stupid. adoption rate abysmal going go way far beyond this. Good seeing early on, people lying vaccine clinics order get 4th 5th shots. quite creepy fully honest. wow - i'd terrified parent states. Canada, 75% one dose far 12-18.

I’ve read “cross vaccination” different vaccine one’s initial two shots shown effective. 

Now I’m reading Pfizer regimen demonstrated 50% efficiency breakthrough infection (vs 80% Moderna). 

I’ve pondering getting third shot planning go Pfizer since first two Moderna. I’m wondering whether higher level protection Moderna cross- vaccination effect two types vaccine efficient choice. Anyone input?

(I suppose admit realize I’m nit-picking - feel pretty fortunate opportunity get third shot, it’s looking like approval imminent round 3 - I’m curious science is.) somewhere California, Los Angeles think people allways write LA city name  Tl;dr:Vaccines tested adults first. plan rolling 6-12 billion vaccine doses rest world is???

The thing is, getting vaxxed you. Sure, benefit get less sick die catch covid again. But, around unable get vaccinated, too. friend whose kid cancer terrible immune system. got covid, he'd die. people like that, too. many speaking absolutes yet absolutely clue you’re talking about

The flu shot yearly influenza virus segmented genome recombines emerges new properties frequently.

All vaccines given schedules provide optimal long term immunity needed yearly… there’s absolutely evidence rationale going end needing yearly SARS-CoV2 vaccines flu comparison merit  Exactly. There's legitimate concern people ignoring Actually impressive. math previous replies simplified assumptions based around efficacy rate actual effective rate.

Its likely effective rate vaccine something like 70-80% depending variant. Since efficacy rates based controlled studies effective rates based real world applications vaccine.

But let's assume lowest number, 70%

A 250% increase 70% would make 3rd dose 91.42% effective. might savior need culling idiot masses Florida. get new variant fuckery, consider resounding success progress. 1. We’ll NZ should’ve proactive competent around vaccinating population. COVID-19 global scale isn’t going anywhere anytime soon possibly ever choosing isolate country continue lockdowns even smallest case numbers % vaccinated low sustainable approach. 0 Covid case goal 80% vaccinated pretty unrealistic radical, can’t imagine country ever reaching 80% full vaccinated least anytime soon NZ rate it’s going. Would crippling lockdowns small number reported cases long time.  
 
2. 2 week lockdown doesn’t even seem realistic possible, going full lockdown reopening process would take least month likelihood reported cases showing high prompting continued lockdown. 

3. ongoing balance countries face keeping country running live lives economy crumble people make living/survive keeping virus bay doesn’t kill injure vulnerable it. choosing lockdown especially small number new reported cases shouldn’t taken lightly Yeah, Hawaii looking good Oregon bad. Yes south terrible rest country isn’t going spared delta

Maybe it’s bad hopefully it’s Hawaii 61% fully vaccinated they’re big trouble - that’s according Hawaii News vaccination rate 80% population 80% eligible population? 80% population would crazy high -- Malta's county world that's gotten small population.   light Delta full return schools, I'm happy asked trials expanded. 

If insist this, let us want opt kids trial. people worried vaccine side effects get huge sample size us feel kids much threatened remaining unvaxxed get protect them. Win win.  

But reality I've tried enroll kids every vax trial I've able find heard absolutely nothing back experience every parent I've talked tried. Need evaluate proper dosage child + efficacy reduced dosage. Yes 0 natural immunity lol.  Quarantine infection two weeks, prevent spread.  One case becomes 10, 100, quickly. US testament that. thought cases fully vaxxed people getting anything beyond mild symptoms - case? so, extremely concerning. dad know people made sacrifices dad's freedom? Freedom free. least could same.    hmm know that. always thought rust. learned something, suppose always better get shot regardless dirt not. Never know been. wonder 2021 figure stack vaccines available. guess it'll worse. Deaths today lower March year, correct.

But statisticians look number hospital admissions today predict number deaths occur two weeks (or so) decent accuracy. know 2% 10%, consistent proportion people go hospital make it.

People usually die COVID day go hospital. takes while.

The fact they've called five refrigerated morgue trucks means surge deaths coming. Suck up?

Not sure say, nobody happy situation. better ending ICU worse, spreading disease someone dies.

A days discomfort seems like brainer.  knew US health system would eventually fuck rest us lol. Sadly, 12 approval going come late. School opens month, kids get natural immunity due Delta schools effectively removing precautions last year.
With natural immunity, parents rush get kids vaccinated. See COVID coming Gulf Mexico need stop Mexico /s experience valued $79.99 12 slated later year, unfortunately. Even better give arms zero doses. Per article church members referring vaccine ""Mark Beast"". damning, powerful association vaccine concept literal evil. begin presume know overcome something like this. Vaccine approval takes time.
 
It even complex seeking approval 12yo due ethics. parent child need fully informed including potential risks 
 
Children little adults size maturity child's immune system huge factor here. talking 2 children age difference 6 months react differently. 
 
Then way children react decline quickly. 
 
So going take time. Depends medications. meds wife takes reduces immune response. immune system respond appropriately vaccine going robust antibodies. 

She knew could get mRNA vaccine taking full meds doctors felt robust response worth getting meds weeks.  idea works, ‘m wondering it’s better get one shot each. J&amp;J, get one next time around? don’t blame people think it’s media thing. wife tried convince sign AZ stuff she’s seen news anyway. Better safe sorry. 

On another note best mate Brazilian, Corinthians fan (I don’t hold him) wish well friend. I'd want see several days flattening I'd call that, South general definitely looks reaching peak. start going couple weeks, overall national numbers may flat even declining, even cases continue rise Upper Midwest, Great Lakes, Northeast. US waves regional throughout pandemic, even big fall/winter wave peaks differed 2 months earliest states latest states. NZ long time Covid restriction free, rest world semi lockdowns, restricted on. think measure quite point. don’t agree here, it’s judgement call part state cases aren’t big deal hospitalization/death sole problems Covid. potential derail health system, makes important prevent else, sure. doesn’t mean stop there, large swaths people getting worst flu lives simultaneously, potentially enduring long term damage result problem societal significance well, it’s “I don’t wanna get sick it’s unpleasant.” UK 61.1% population vaccinated.  know.

Is kind blood poisoning one get rust myth keep shipwrecks well I'll take many boosters needed. Big yikes.

Hasn’t current vaccine shown effective delta variant? Yep. nz looks trouble getting through. can.  Every country screwed one way another.  Nz mostly normal whole time though.  someone baby late February 2020 really hard determine risk one two month shots March April 2020 (mine date little information understand others opted stay home, barely made postpartum visit April, stopped soon told us good luck) sucks - I’m sorry hear sister hope recovers soon without going hospital. Extremely worrying getting harder see end this. may wrong impression valve concentrate air outward forcefully escapes cloth? right, force exhalation concentrated smaller area funneled would create bottleneck expel air outward (I may wrong) Vaccines contain adjuvants, historically form aluminum salt, increase immune response. immune system tricked putting real effort. Typhoid Mary immune typhoid fever chronic carrier, infectious 30 years. 

And like people today, refused quarantine isolate, continued work cook. Linking cdc website accurate info politics? That's really interesting way describing There's /asklegal sub want get better answer. bad assumption; forest fires Washington still [pretty grim](http://fireinfo.dnr.wa.gov/). way get back anything close normal involves putting conditions like while.

If ignore that, virus stick around, continue mutate, kill, spread rapidly. never life used know it. government rapidly lose popularity

This sad true. really no-win government officials office. see happening AUS populace angrily lashing Morrison NSW premier letting COVID spread.

The NZ prime minisiter darling managing pandemic I'm guessing going come thunderous end point.

People's anger really misguided fear. thank you. got vaccine could stop wearing mask, that's longer case. Fool once, shame you.... Except assuming linear growth, delta r0 may high 9 (though figures conservative ~6), implies pretty huge exponential growth. signed executive order would withhold funds/salaries school districts implemented mask mandates.

That's disgusting. Yeah, I'm optimistic third dose even effective.

Basically possible second dose 3-4 weeks provided lot short-term immunity, long-term immunity would better achieved 3-6 month interval. was, however, feasible study given urgency.   get what’s point vaccine still transmit get disease? lessen effects? that’s would require like they’re required stops transmitting thanks Got mine April. December is. time send kids back school...    Pennsylvania teachers got 😬 That’s also doctor told - one additional shot needed “booster” 

Of course, still lot data needed I’m sure I’ll get another booster next several months. seems safe assume we’ll need boosters years come given mishandled everything been. Good him! unvaccinated honestly treated ""doctors"" get ""medical information"" Facebook anyway. regions, physician right refuse service (as long situation imminently life-threatening), obligation transfer service another provider. point make life hard possible unvaccinated get it. anti vaccers reduce degree natural vaccination, bigger problem might future mutations reopen cycle... Sure take months next variant taking COVID mutating right now. Even people aren’t hospitalized delta variant includes high amount virus. 

More virus means faster mutation. single people know sexually active Covid barely ever stopped dating hooking except maaaaaybe month March 2020.

It’s happening Tinder instead bars, meetups parties, it’s happening rate. Quarantine bio-terrorist states. Sure let know long term 5 year plan. win year two pandemic turn endemic. NZ model isn’t going work here.  moved Nashville last night, lived rural suburban TN that. confirm. need anything get right Thailand. Doesn’t matter is, approved vaccine get someone’s arm now.  That's fuckton deaths. Drowning lungs matter hard try breathe?

Yea….pretty miserable….and god damn frightening.   That’s really good news  6000 one school district quarantine , wow Looks like I'm due September 20th!  There’s many sports activities kids outside school. level interaction kids outside school lot. Masks school may slow spread, it’s going stop anything. called *ethical grey area*. We're talking points continuum, fundamentally discrete categories.  ok? someone explain vaccine less effective given time? different getting vaxed bunch things child again? could also used warn people potential issues caused vaccine. “informed” seek professional medical advice trusted health providers. 

Blackballing journalist disagree sad. However, certain groups would proud you.  I’ve read, CDC’s recommendation boosters 8 months official, recommend take third shot manufacturer. Right now, there’s evidence mixing mRNA shots effective sticking one brand. studies shown improved immune response single brand mRNA dosing mixing Astra Zenica mRNA. AZ isn’t approved US, option isn’t available you.

Additionally, evidence beginning show Moderna may effective two, least far antibody production goes (we know B cell cell level). taken Pfizer, might make sense pursue Moderna. makes sense reverse. Consult doctor, I’m willing bet rec get before.

(Which worries some, I’d like seniors medically vulnerable life get Moderna booster really effective.)  Actually problem countries face. Many gotten used deaths degree really. vaccinate literally everyone vaccines next? point near future countries let run expect deaths unvaccinated degree also vaccinated, cannot maintain endless cycle lockdowns etc... NZ might harder facing death waves countries had. hand many people deaths hard covid cases surroundings hard hit countries relative.  never onto winner that. People Chinese, they're afraid government (especially punishments strong), happened lot people flooded next town area got locked down. useless plaster issue.   see too, cannot accurate. Maybe day two might acceptable outlier. way cases going way deaths continue drop. immunocompromised decided get own? ask immunocompromised? Yea son turned 3 I’m pretty devastated.  Third time's charm. Really, think it'll like flu shot unless board it, easily upset someone country flying driving bringing something else really. found 1960, think it'll disappear anytime soon. Go get stabbed today, got 3rd stabbing.  even mass gatherings right now. would require way testing  knows feds provide money school districts sounds like wants withhold funding go elsewhere. “Everyone wins” eyes - schools still get funding, masks stuff, gets money move budgets. question whether immunocompromised not? Hi there. mandate.  actually took immunology senior year too, idea two years later everyone would suddenly goddamn expert modifying old saying, goodwill begins home.  Everybody says correlations exist, actually? Prayers family.
It’s they’re sick regret decision. Regret get vaccine please. regret 9 yr old special needs granddaughter got relative neglected tell parents antivaxxer. Outdoor event too.  FDA deliberate methodical, good reason. 

Problem is, virus isn't.

Which mitigation measures matter much. help buy us time vaccines officially authorized.

The anti maskers making worse us. Listen, don’t usually get sick. can’t remember last time flu. sometimes get flu vaccine clinics set job…but miss don’t fret it. vaccine I’ve actively sought get life. empathy people think they’re well enough soldier Covid. it’s really easy get vaccine (in U.S). table set distribute baseball game went recently. (I didn’t see anyone getting it). it’s sad situation end way. don’t understand many stories it’s going take convince people fence get vaccine. Even keep suffering quarter much guy wouldn’t worth it? $4 billion gave COVAX tens millions vaccines donated keep donating certainly help. US one country, alone can’t solve everyone’s problems.  Ok going first thing found JD professional doctorate PhD research doctorate

Interesting... funny probabilities. Even anti-vax, anti-mask people catch ever. professions America well organized medical doctors. wish trades anything close guarantees income self determined working conditions. leave profession they’ve gotten in.   Scared flu? Based evidence exactly?  non vaccinated person really like Typhoid Mary group vaccinated people ?

If actively spreading, likely. People contagious long, seeing numbers we're seeing, people spreading REALLY spreading actually surge projected fall ? large events example ( like concert wedding ) dangerous fully vaccinated people fall?

Predicting virus always gone children really greater risk due mutations ?

Lots people seem think so, plenty agree. they're ones unable get vaccinated, they're higher *relative* risk before. Players union blocking vaccine mandate.  mean, get point, take hippocratic oath? spoons barely stick body anymore! 2nd opinions, assholes, dumbasses, shitty office staff, chairs dildos them. 

All good reasons see another doctor.  said spread eventually matter what. going tangents saying wrong. Glad see agree.   people fucking crazy  blame Twitter letting MTG speak mind, oh intelligent tweets help many people…../s Idk free subs get free donuts 😉 confirm doctor said exactly morning Good duck anti vax people lot churches done things. Well, hope “personal responsibility” crowd would, know, take personal responsibility. purpose. panacea ails ya ain’t it, though. Potentially avoidable risk. Make sure use words make point. 


Avoidable risk would mean I'm vaccinated, vaccinated, can't catch Covid all. simply true. also element us buying supporting vaccine rollout pacific islands. People different beliefs. Respect FFS Fair enough, curious.  country. License suspended likely imprisonment spreading medical misinformation causing danger public health. 20 years ago treated condition require monitoring potential cancer cell development. biopsy came back possible precancerous cellular changes doctor sat said time surgery remove problem. asked would happen choose wait see, said, ""Then find another doctor I'm going stand watch one patient die unnecessarily."" love doctor many years. went annual physical end said ""You due XXX booster, important helpful.......""

I felt bad Doctors, like actually feels urge patients vaccines. 

&amp;#x200B;

""Yeah, whatever, load Doctor"" Texas FL even top 15 US states terms pandemic long impact. reason surging seasonality (hitting entire sun belt) Delta. thing going happen MW NE states fall / winter. think Israeli figures 3rd vaccine encouraging. time keeping door shut best plan vaccines secured. see rational primary care doctor would this, long allergy well documented taking every reasonable step avoid exposure. letter informative, legally binding doctor see *anyone* who's vaccinated. I'm sure families kids young get vaccinated. One assumes he's going kick either.

But mean, *does* decide die hill want see someone medically can't get vaccine, said he'd transfer records. places one doctor. 96% doctors U.S. vaccinated

Can back source? that's awesome number!  got it, thanks Far right ideologies, low level education, general issues authority/defiance defiance's sake, hostile view public.

So words. Big, dumb, bullies. anyone know picked 8?

So don’t cause rush people vaccine lines distribute people got earlier Okay enhanced intubation got good 😂  go ways. Recently annual checkup noticed never asked recommended vaccination. asked nurse said ask want support personal choice.  say anything back little surprised answer. makes wonder standard care I'm getting rather shop new doctor. again, I'm Texas insurance vaccine questioners might find anything near available anyway. NZ would zero covid implemented shit reactionary policies like world has, including country Canada. one illusion NZ able maintain current numbers forever, current strategy economy done fine, they've 26 deaths. would call extreme success comparison countries normalized hundreds thousands deaths day. country values economic growth life, mean NZ well. Ugh. I'm sorry. hope girlfriend stays well. Logic run course refusers. IMO they're causing harm country fellow citizens. I'm fine applying pressure. actually force vaccinations anyone...but serious ostracization rest society. human right spreading...and that's they're doing. whole crappy business would mostly them. Holy moly Sewergators wasted Corona Right now, even American Academy Pediatrics [urging speed timeline. slow deliberative design fine peacetime medicine, needs flexibility true emergencies.

My gf, teaches here, wanted bring box clean disposable masks students forgot masks use leave them. However principle school, said that's allowed. According opted masks, 60- 70% students wear masks. teaches 5th grade. trans people seeking HRT. shocking passes ""treatment"" doctors. happens overweight folks? Interested here. factor risks, catching COVID-19 also attacked angry anti vaxxers also PTSD seeing thousands die.   vaccines 100% aren't, still chance get sick.

Sorry suffered.  
At stage borders opened. New Zealand buying time. Time vaccinate citizens. Time see troubles countries. nations sharing information number people affected reduced substantially.  
I Australia severe lockdown due delta escaping community. massive vaccine drive reach 80% end october. understand vaccination unlucky enough 8% get really sick instead seem like flu. Lockdown means cannot drive 5km home. local government areas police army greater numbers. someone tested positive, police/army visit daily make sure home spreading virus secondly need moved hospital case get sicker. curious nature virus everyone gets really sick even aware sick. sorry badly affected virus. according methodology headlines always leave half data. 322 ICU beds left Texas total 7706 ICU beds. would expect anything different less 8k beds 30 million people two years global pandemic. handled previous waves better, means less natural immunity. death rate gone yet (cases spikes month ago) largely thanks vaccination.    best part can't pull ""My Doctor said need it"" bullshit  asking advice others thought.  Damn thought weed headline actually fucked  That's GP's England people made take vaccine made wear mask  excerpt:

The scientists found aerosol exposure directly deposited SARS-CoV-2 deep lungs, whereas fomite exposure resulted initial virus replication nose. Regardless exposure route, animals SARS-CoV-2 replicating lungs, lung damage severe aerosol-exposed animals compared fomite group. 
 
A second part study compared animal-to-animal transmission virus air contaminated cage environments (fomites). Airborne transmission markedly efficient compared fomite transmission, suggesting airborne droplets key SARS-CoV-2 transmission route. additional experiment, using air flowing infected uninfected animals, supported finding: Reversing airflow uninfected infected animals greatly reduced transmission efficiency. 
 
The findings support public health guidance focused interventions reduce indoor airborne transmission SARS-CoV-2. efforts include masking, increasing air filtration social distancing, well handwashing regular surface disinfection, particularly clinical settings. oh. duh Florida's numbers goofed up. know really hard get test here, got tested two weeks ago took 4 days get test. That's increased.   referring students, count includes 80 employees. big brain comment thread.

If you’re gonna deny healthcare (which think absolutely criminal) people based use certain medication, what’s next?

I think get challenged court physician denied license. Doctors functioning democratic first-world society duty provide care anyone comes doors (who isn’t threatening gun). doesn’t matter patient took certain drug beforehand not.

At point vaccine mandate shit gotten seriously hand.

Although would love mandate people get skinny treat disease lol /s Next sue school board allowing send kids without masks.    Sure, also make reasonable assumptions based things know. Covid magical alien virus. understand good amount now. illogical predict surge cases time period know nearly every respiratory virus (including coronaviruses) spike. mention factors like staying indoors big holiday gatherings. No, virus ""clock"" goes ""well winter better start spreading more."" almost things KNOW enhance spread increased winter season. Nevada, AK getting close that. Basically states got hit wave early on. It’s dropping Florida well.  get might make sense, side effects. classified folks made vaccines medical professionals reviewed them. vaccines designed intended produce effects even expected many instances. intended purpose vaccine protect illness, anything else happens process side effect part intentional design. saying people going hospital emergency services required show proof vaccination. Yes.

I fell once, landed thin metal bar abdomen. impact pulled artery intestines began bleed internally. time made ER, lost 4 liters blood internally almost pulse. required present proof vaccination receiving life-saving exploratory abdominal surgery, would dead even vaccinated.

If logic hurts brain, maybe stroke get hospital ER, refuse treat evidence can't speak even suggest vaccinated. Far right ideologies, low level education, general issues authority/defiance defiance's sake, hostile view public. ""Do want join MaxxVaxx downline?""     life dude whatever want Wish this.

The people wont get vaccine ones going doctors advised vaccine, take ICU beds. 

Meanwhile, family member gets bad accident cant get treated ICU filled morons. end dying jackass vent complaining still dont want vaccine laying ICU bed would likely available people got vaccinated. 

Then getting pumped drugs getting hospital, asking drugs got.....so fucking stupid!

I respect peoples decisions, also think pay decision, good bad. doctors really give shit money. risk tolerance think that's need that's fine. Tennessee, #33 education. see parents rushing kids school. *are* stalling vaccines. medical infrastructure able handle influx patients unvaccinated population covid gets loose now, interested trying fool believing will. *may* able handle influx we're vaccinated either, hell lot better.

The plan (as detailed last week) get many people jabbed possible next 6-8 months open border, self isolation recommended people travel. Right nowhere near vaccination goal, right border stays shut go hard trace Covid try get population ready possible.

Does make sense? Yeahhh it’s republicans politicizing medicine though.  I'm puzzled US saying 5% ICU admissions fully vaccinated whereas Israel says half. terrain really different? Um... could upvote 1000 times would. Drives batty threshold COVID ""Zero cases, full stop"" mere mention infection fully vaccinated person elicits kind reaction told someone late stage Pancreatic Cancer. I'm convinced folks literally think COVID certified death sentence ""best"" cripple Long COVID. fear far removed science. Damn, good job getting vaccinated. hard work beginning pandemic thrown away. Southerners really putting rally caps take lead Northeast.  narrative pushed actors bad intentions. rest combination people exhausted taking precautions truly thought vaccines perfect.  hope like kids   friend owns factory (that pivoted perfume manufacturing hand sanitizer) morgue, many employees outright refused vaccine able offered essential workers need physically show work. finally agreed take neighbors started dying left right center take need vaccine visit mall. partner family anti vaxxers.

There also lot misinformation going around well. anti-vaccine culture concept exist. Tampa area. assume wear underwear. dress code, even become relaxed. vaccine?   people realize you’re vaccinated something doesn’t mean won’t catch it. Maybe covid didn’t evolve vaccines would almost eradicated virus delta vaccines less effective getting symptoms. Also I’m sure chances needing go hospital higher well still extremely low. people would get vaccinated wear mask wouldnt need anymore lockdowns.

There’s lot us would love chance prevent breakthrough symptomatic COVID using tools available like Regeneron. Getting COVID inconvenient, affects jobs daily lives, puts around us risk. Yeah went second Pfizer. It'll pass.  abbott that. Maybe send ship full masks require people wear public spaces  He's fully vaccinated getting early antiviral treatment, likely stay fully asymptomatic

Pays governor, general, pays vaccinated. constituents would realize yes Guillain-Barre get groceries [touring musician athlete exempt allowed /SARCASM Trump got covid really stop downplaying virus. think clearly lot selective listening regards vaccines work. polio vaccine shingles vaccine pretty much creates immunity, rather like flu vaccine decreases symptoms. There's really thing breakthrough case--the vaccines never intended create immunity. ppl read hear want to. I'm happy see cast majority vaccinated cases mild moderate; exactly expected. There's easy way average Joe Shmoe avoid confusion: wear mask. hard that?  I'm vaccinated goal posts moved last months. Back everyone first started getting everyone celebrating assumed over.   many commenters actually read article?

I sure didn't. feels like useless endeavor point. 

Keeping community safe enough. Seeing friends/neighbors/family/coworkers die enough. Now, children dying alarming rate enough.

I'm wasting time. fact, I've started blocking every AntiVa within personal circle community circle. absolutely interest ever interacting again. NZ went single vaccine strategy effective vaccine, Pfizer. Developing nations beating NZ relied heavily less effective vaccines like Sinovac Sinopharm. far higher vaccination rates protected living far restrictions NZ. worries too, esp side effects bad first set vaccines.

Thankfully, reports Israel’s initial round boosters post-vaccination symptoms manageable. study 4500, 88% said side effects worse milder. Israel 100% mRNA vaccines. Still issue wrestle with, hopefully initial jolt immune systems first doses worst it. FFS TIP GRATUTIY. Grab clue.  really. People sick it. Taking away fun things people necessary get mess. Cognitive dissonance hell drug. People love act like mask mandates nothing, masks big deal many little reasons compound lot. people terrible reactions skin, difficult communicate, especially another country speaking accents foreign languages, everyone knows forced wear mask gym fitness class horrible. short, cannot live full life mask. open theaters concerts, people attend way would without masks. one wants go concert able enjoy freely. 

Also travel internationally significantly work, it’s job livelihood pay bills, last 18 months devastating. Spring saw surge, last weeks free fall cancellations postponements delta. Everyone loves talk travel “frivolous vacation”, travel industry supports hundreds millions people around world. Every cancelled job thousands dollars can’t reinvest business, pay freelancers, qualify mortgage. can't wear long outdoors hot out. disease knocks body's ability control temperature correctly mask big contributer overheating. mostly feel fine without outdoors though. one explained anything thing makes conclusive argument. Amazing keep replying literally basis opinion.  Monoclonal antibodies associated 20% reduction risk death. Don’t get wrong; I’d take infected, that’s pretty weak reduction justify DeSantis’s policies. Abbot slim, 63 wheelchair bound life, can't great overall health. What? Source? not. Vaccines safe way go  that's insane. people high risk tier also.  true. Proactive individuals ok part. Hospitals suffer. claimed Darwin. industry pretty. Going FEMA'd Florida Texas day now. EO new Executive Order emphasizes path forward relies personal responsibility rather government mandates. Texans mastered safe practices help prevent avoid spread COVID-19.""

So much ""personal responsibility"" ""mastering safe practices."" clusterfuck! sad ridiculous sarcastic positions can't identified, look sound like positions taken community leaders. 

If genuinely stupid, think would capability abstractly thinking opinion 2nd party point view? issue expecting people pay something expectation instead gratuity still cant define. shit fine questionable. Flu shots given every year. get spread control possible need COVID boosters often all. I'm done feeling sorry them. feel sorry medical staff.  Caring citizens first selfish? Completely topic continues upvote regurgitated stupid shit jfc probably coped lot better people stay home. already lot hobbies done home.

The problem convincing go enjoy life usual. told stay home long, can't convince go non essential trips eat out. absolutely understand logic double vaccinated taking precaution (hygiene + masking reasonable) way forward, covid us forever. can't shake mind set 'that go unless essential'.

It's like easy lockdown(s) I'm mental issues going normal. convinced go IKEA last weekend, alone is, one step time guess. incredibly amero-centric worldview think vaccinating 100% Americans would stopped disease. vaccines weren’t made tackle transmission. main goal reduce risk hospitalization. working brilliantly made for. NOLA allows PCR test last 72 hours. see, also 2nd pfizer. see tomorrow LA ever get way? Guess J&amp;J folks wait little longer get sub benefit delay see happens overseas. locked hard saw happens Delta rely contact tracing. Earlier pandemic case escaping community every two weeks, lockdown contact tracing enough. 

Now seeing real world data efficacy vaccines coverage needed slow infections. months even data whether vaccine wears completely 9 months year. know 3rd booster shots effective everyone essential. 

Waiting longer means time better antivirals come market, time get safety data young children vaccinated too. also means able see even worse variants pop change everything. give elimination late, never go back. Better patient cautious. economy growing, wage growth time highs, unemployment lower pre-pandemic, 95% time life totally normal. afford keep strategy longer.  see could stopped it. realistically another 18 months vaxxes worldwide get herd immunity. Even we'd gotten 100% US, still huge swathes world would take longer. real story. He's vaxxed getting instant A-tier care, he'll likely fine. cycle death continues policies place. That's assuming sense begin with... think Krispy Kreme one free donut day til end year show vaccine card. least little something! Depending live, might get it. California requires employers give time vaccine side effects.  Correct. Maybe doctors forever stash cards ready available, maybe administrator like “well haven’t done vaccinations months now, I’ll throw spares away taking needless space.”

I don’t see point deliberately thing I’ve asked equally viable options available. Seems childish me. Fines non compliance Israel already it, many places too. whether needed safe.  drives crazy... teacher say kids socialize fine mask, something cannot quarantined sick. get mutation easily transmitted, high death rate slow progression see infected. Gonna go limb say 'Delta' probably last major variant/wave most. chances mutating become vaccine resistant low. mutate enough completely evade vaccines would mean spike protein altered probably turning itself. Massive flash point explosion cases last month +. We're probably peaking now. give 2-3 weeks start see cases drop. No, never going away, fear gone we're longer naive immune populous. Small flare ups there, falls back mere nuisance probably sooner lot think. really, no.

There many factors would need considered mandate makes sense. FDA approval one many significant factors. wouldn’t give us data daily it’s true? would encourage people get vaccine. Yes! I'm dissapointed federal leadership. hot mess live radio silence national level. I'm still waiting answer mass casualties supposedly going kick in. started mass vaccinations january 7 months still nothing...and infertility? Hasnt seemed happen yet year get sick regret it? 2 years? 10 years still waiting everyone die it??  You’re plague rat. Workers damned! /s fact god damned many deaths completely unnecessary something still can't get over. 

Just fucking unnecessary. saying long Covid getting vaccinated cured it? people want talk that? vaccine makes dramatically less likely get virus addition reducing severity get it. Well that’s fucked ‘some central database’... Jesus, thought mocking Abbott. That's legitimate quote article... Keep mind claws become indestructible adamantium infusion. Prior regular claws. would legitimate oxygen deprivation.  similar reaction last week got tested negative covid. think true getting regular cold transmission since people maskless now.  delta takes lock hospitals flooded like south? thanks So…can get third then? gone that, make reason. gave new one forgot first one home second shot I'm sure big deal Yeah mine CA whole US done year ago. Would prefer max mandate? that's alternative True also. home Villages. I've read different numbers Pfizer's effectiveness. number 40% suggested, include hospitalization death limited getting breakthrough?

THere many numbers borderline overwhelming. go 9 months without seeing partner? kind contractual agreement separates you?? totally get it.. could hold little keep wearing mask kids 12 vaccinated, would awesome. Given contagious thing is, I’d say yes. Terrible. reported taken custody assault? I've heard speculation Moderna could higher potential side effects uses 3 times mRNA Pfizer vaccine. IIRC, Pfizer 30mcg mRNA Moderna uses 100mcg. 

I initially wanted Moderna, ended getting Pfizer times hearing speculation. I've also read lot anecdotes seem confirm this, seen actual numbers support it. what's worth, side effect experienced Pfizer jabs tenderness shoulder injected. can, did. want believe it. marked world clearly US standards regulations? Yep, different borough, I'm Brooklyn. restaurants I'm talking around downtown Brooklyn, I've also couple restaurants Manhattan past couple weeks. lol learning live like learning live hurricanes. force nature cannot bargain smart thinking getting 3rd shot. 21 year old college except university allowed require masks vaccinations due state law. I'm young workout regularly got healthy weight category I'm risking moderate asthma getting worse catch covid.  get 4th shot, got it. entirely honest you- ran trials areas high infection rates could get end-point efficacy quickly (and good way stress-test efficacy). may better not, was/is cool sure.  


You check future trials currently enrolling trials things online- pregnant friend actually multiple trials, least one life-saving device medication belt vaccine. :) Highly recommend. types trials involve medicines/vaccines could look (maybe later tho lol). sub doesn’t. look upon people vaccinated.

-not sure restaurant codes come city? city auditors? quickly actually add new items process? audits involve sampling *clientele* rather restaurant area/process?

I incredibly skeptical happen confirm - Abbot indicted felon Paxton argue merits go record claiming masks ineffective promoting public health pandemic? Yes, that's reason need increase vaccinations, otherwise, people worse time overusing hospital resources. Healthcare premiums probably $2,000/month time kids grow up. won’t universal healthcare then. So, guess they’ll suffer?  Ah right right, sorry used wrong word. 

Legacy vaccines(like flu shot) inert amount virus vaccine itself. That’s meant viral load. It’s people feel symptomatic receiving vaccines, afaik. 

My layman understanding mRNA vaccines rather including virus, bodies immune system figuring fight off, give immune system blueprint fighting off, actual battle takes place.

Especially environment much news get online fake misleading. so...orphans... :-( Remember, essential working diligently pandemic nothing show it, unskilled worker asking basic living. I'm fully vaccinated, events makes feel I'll patient zero Covid-Omega-3. one, comparing FDA approved vaccines emergency use authorized vaccines.

So, vaccines FDA-approved, mandates fine? Maybe lead instead. bad good way. anti-vaxxers can't run around infecting others themselves. ""my immune system best"" contest hallways them. Precedent (sorta): 2005, Hunter S. Thompson get cremated shot cannon, per will. IDK preachers teaching COVID far, article seems rather backhanded. would religious leader, teaching several thousand year old scriptures, expected clear opinion fairly medical technology? No, got tested covid negative. Literally likely fall, like said everytime comes  mean watching homegrown taliban take over...this insane. Adjust expectations realize people simply die COVID every year. 100's thousands already die annually around world influenza malaria. Death COVID added tallies eventually accepted new baseline. Could someone explain science behind new recommendation light reduced effectiveness delta variant? vaccine released couple months ago? so, goal protect delta? really understand problem. venues gonna effected necessities.   thought Pfizer immunity wore faster Moderna. J&amp;J seems less efficacy two vaccines. want know side effects expect. second Pfizer two days fatigued week. wonder expect similar booster - though I’m obviously either way.  Go neighboring state. States don’t often share medical data. breakthrough COVID positive last week.

Every symptom except fever loss taste smell.

I mild- fatigue, watery eyes, sinus pressure, GI issues, brain fog, sore throat

 (37 yo healthy)

6 days symptoms Yeah. I'm implying anything fancy. think misunderstood mandate. Vaccine cards required takeout delis. indoor dining, gyms, venues etc. still pop places grab something go. I'm willing bet restaurant seating takeout still allow curbside pickup well. can't sit dine in. Vaccination masking seems Trivial Pursuit, too. Antivaxxers keep playing Cards Humanity like Game Life. lack care Boggle one's mind. Simple steps get R0 Uno. mascot sus. LMFAO feel like kids 12 still going doctors yearly check ups. hope get vaccine pediatricians give. feel? Yeah good all, healthcare system currently collapsing major part country, boosters thing mitigate that. fall, unvaccinated filling hospitals kills vaccinated FAR declining immunity. know rate PCR false negatives is? Husband fully vaxxed 2/3 Pfizer. watching closely 7 week old. got “booster” couple weeks ago, Friday. Sore arms, sore armpit (lymph nodes?) reaction initial shots. Got sick waiting CDC announce what, frankly, Reddit known weeks now. bullshit “you don’t need masks” Feb 2020. Seriously thank God Reddit. family makes without getting covid, truly due “whistleblowers” Reddit. tested covid came back positive anything stopping walking local pharmacy asking vaccine, without telling third shot? lot comments starting sound like ones made people favor requiring ID vote.

Weird local govt would require one other. Got it…yeah knowing probably already lost lol hopefully implement something similar CA. I’ve already seen many people get infected fully vaccinated b/c people won’t get shots!!! mean access them. able license AZ vaccine serum institute brand use those, Pfizer, Moderna, J&amp;J etc allow that. Even Pfizer opened vaccine plant India, vaccines would still belong Pfizer could sell highest bidder. thin blue flatline. I’ll right behind see Pfizer February. Bummed it’s going take long said it’s 42% effective Delta. see someone asshole, side vocally worker respectful way. Outbreaks tend calm public support. considering bit too. figured prioritize overall efficacy instead shitty days symptoms. We'll see end regretting days haha.  Pretty crazy think 5 national parks June left mask home. wearing everywhere Likely local corner drug store pharmacy choice. download scan app yourself, it’s App Store free. anything say would convince covid? Fuck Forbes bs keeps posted data back up. actual data could find cited Washington post survey 4500 nurses showing 83% vaccination rate May 22000 nurse survey from
February showing 70% vaccination rate. anyone look actually died, parole officers, correctional officers, desk jockies. mention mostly old obese. bs highest order. fair - antibodies people within right opt risk vaccine shot literally reason. 

The risk COVID vaccine bad reaction low. like vaccine none. opt out, mandate. That’s news me. It’s hard keep everything. interested see recommend 2nd J&amp;J recommend Moderna booster J&amp;J. Canadian think major US cities New Orleans definitely there. actually heard city kind small. sure actual size city population Wikipedia says size small city. city considered mid size Canada suppose, also 1/10th population spread across larger country thus much less large cities. mean NOLA history culture foreigner's perspective would think things like Boston, NY, LA, Chicago, Houston, Dallas, Philadelphia, etc etc

there cities like Seattle, New Orleans, Milwaukee, Denver, Portland, etc definitely larger cities consider major grand scheme world. comparison, Canada really four major cities, Toronto, Vancouver, Calgary, Montreal knocked ass days boys!!! second shot put bed day better alternative. [Contact vaccine lost get replacement. Take photo card still it. Oh know, it’s really bad. Gonna watching YouTube tomorrow people total meltdowns young service workers job. Gonna fully booked day cheers antivax entertainment sorry service workers may gods forever favour. Vaccine equity doesn’t matter doesn’t stop transmission. Okay anecdote n 1 extrapolating entire population vaccine never offered 100% protection.  Pfizer vaxxed here. wait 6 months? UK deployed 4 vaccines, periods longer recommend manufactures, presumably also longer expected women.

Do link original study? would interested see multi-variant analysis vaccines? understanding particular supposed side effect commonly reported recipients specific brands vaccines. important case UK's vaccine deployment.

It would nice study able clearly exonerate 4 brands meaningful reproductive side effects. haven’t asked vaccine card pass anywhere yet. downloaded ago case something happened original see anyone actually asks mandate enforced. Well, merry Christmas then.

Literally, see ya December, Pfizer plan get 6 year. enough body start producing wifi. Yea see viewing platforms buildings enforced hiked trails Canyon since late 80s imagine bit busier since worked there. virus won’t go away COVID 19 become another cold. serious question though- like already pressuring boosters us smart enough get boosters mandating wackadoodles actually get vaccine? 

I mean I’m happy getting booster to. SUPER annoyed though a*holes haven’t anything spread lies. It’s weird bringing choice like big win ?

The right thing would allow business require proof vaccine choose. Period. 

And stop comparing public schools fda approved vaccines private business emergency vaccine. 

It’s straw man argument. 

You pro vax sensible also recognizing bad move personal freedoms. JJ get second dose booster, might take bit longer, get offer. US recommending boosters everyone 8 months second shot. It’ll interesting see that’s true. work CA school. Vaccines mandated employees. Masks well absolutely everyone. classroom two expensive new air filters. 

On top that, people take masks seriously here. lot people never stopped wearing them, vaccination rates high. Even things we’re looking good requirements lifted, grocery store least 50% mask rate. it’s 100% easy.

I sincerely hope don’t close. figured given?

I think like disagree disagree. thx. hate here. time flu season. promise one profiting timing.  (Ps I’m vaccinated health care worker -
Who understands capitali$m) Never said anything self regulation lack it, means develop vaccine rapidly derive powerful, wealthy corporations, derived capitalism.

The vaccines created government. government paid subsidized private entities. Hospitals this. I'm boat you, went J&amp;J triple vaccinated instead quad. me, J&amp;J third shot par with, definitely less severe than, second Novavax shot. Good luck let us know goes! Pretty sure boomers highest vaccination rate That’s called sickcation. Like said elsewhere thread, speculation: I'd imagine due approved use, order control supply workers started getting late dec/early Jan, maybe say ""get booster 6 months"", they'll start getting way many people coming get shot, due different groups bunching together.

I could foresee situation clinics end moving forward 8 month date start seeing significant drops demand. makes go one particular study citing 40% effectiveness other, robust studies showing 75%+? Same. Fully vaccinated January 20th live area super low vaccine rates. Violent dogs put down. Oh know song. Came spring 2020. would cover this? seem Delta-specific version yet, booster existing one.

The thing Delta particularly immune-evasive, one thinking something would evade vaccines. Pfizer made booster targeting so-called ""South African"" variant vaccine-resistance, turned Delta outcompeted it.

I suppose they're working Delta booster now, time ready may something else outcompetes that. get they're going third dose OG vaccine now. That's exciting. Can't wait another shot.

I predict we'll get new vaccine year, like yearly flu shot, die.

I'm okay that. Canceled due counterfeiting.  Booooooo ""It's ready now."" There’s study published New England Journal Medicine basically showed J&amp;J recipients higher antibody levels month 8 week 8. Also varied antibodies showed “evolving” cellular immunity. would surprised they’re recommended boosters while. I'm sorry got covid - makes feel better J&amp;J, people know got covid either pfizer moderna vaxed (one person know sick almost two weeks friend caught hospitalized, early 30s, underlying conditions, Pfizer vaxxed.) crummy luck end, right thing getting shot available you, hang regrets. Hope recover soon. Death immunity passed subsequent generations. novel virus stops novel. happy got 3rd moderna shot last friday! Enough waiting. wife got vaccinated pfizer 6 months ago got infected seriously enough lose taste smell, get brain fog fatigue.

I think accept unavoidable.  get antibody test check them? interested sure available, get it, type criteria use get test scale use know high level be. insight experience? reformulated booster based delta? sounds like real answer.  That’s feel- shot #2 enough show badly want avoid getting actual infection. Yeah, unfortunately vax rates kids age 12-17 \~33%, kinda foreboding uptake amongst 12s.

Hope I'm wrong, think supply going major issue  Hopefully one yet nothing locked requirement vaccination proof. meant like news headlines made sound like weren’t really effective . example one glance one would make statement like “Well doesn’t sound like vaccine works well.”. I’m saying think like that. I’m sure people assume . Found FAQ page I’m sure it’ll work state. came back April it’s possible it’s updated include state.

Maybe. can't comment standards since I've never paramedic.

Generally, government wasteful private sector meets exceeds gov standards.

And that's going mention well.. population spread. US urban areas, considerable population that's spread rural areas.

I may wrong here, believe firefighters technically paramedics across board. also volunteer fire EMS like y'all do. varies state state though.

Our federal government typically concerns intrastate commerce issues involve multiple states. even issues generally concern commerce. sad see hit Delta. good. Safe effective? Sure. pharmaceutical ghouls profit chemotherapy drugs scalp people insulin suddenly found conscience decided best darn human beings could, *right thing do.*

Face - absolutely zero liabilities companies. vaccine even make less likely get virus, ""reduces symptoms"" totally immeasurable claim. Even class-action suit attempted, hide behind emergency provisions. even enough, company tremendous slush fund money set aside specifically bribe hurt signing NDA agreements.

Totally legit, guys. nothing good stuff - hesitate stupid monster who's literally killing Grandma every breath take.

What measure, however, truckloads federal money sent companies every vaccine make. absolutely best interest spread vaccine far wide, well release rolling list 'boosters' never end. amount people online say work healthcare field call HIPPA stunning. damn thing lol.

Explaining: I'm Brazilian PhD student got scholarship year abroad Germany. applied visa February, Germany enacted travel ban Brazil. Today finally received email communicating rules changed visa application accepted. However, provide proof vaccination either Pfizer AZ get it. none, took Sinovac's Coronavac (we allowed choose vaccines Brazil foolish enough comply rules).

Edited  already limit rights unvaccinated citizens. choose vaccinate children, allowed attend public school (which IMO bigger deal allow resturant). I'm wondering also disagree practice? 

There's reason this. vaccinations required students, smaller percentage population cannot vaccinated/vaccines work would effectively unable attend public schools (because outbreak preventable disease -made likely mass unvaccinated children- would risking death them). egregious violation *their* personal freedom, individuals choose medical status.

Thanks comparing far numbers me. leaves bit queasy especially school starting immediately fair. Someone help math. 2 jabs gives 90% plus protection, mean get another 250%?

I assume start curing people around you. :) wrong saying national, pandemic global lol 

I've never heard referred national pandemic before, weirdly patriotic messed way. understand. trying tough guy something? Like, mask, helps protect covid, biggest cop killer 2020  case countries higher vaccination rates?

Furthermore, assuming issue vaccines Pfizer? I'm guessing talking cases requiring hospitalization Hi live Neshoba county could wrong. meat grinder people packed together mud (whole fairground nothing mud) 10,000 VOTE REPUBLICAN signs literally every surface.

Oh yeah there's nothing do. There's 4-5 carnie rides, horse racing (they whip shit horses, brutal horrible), like 100 folding tables selling awful tee shirts that's it. sell alcohol, everyone brought own. restaurants, shows.

Those cute cabins? cost 6 figures (real houses area go less) land they're they're accessible couple weeks fair time. actual fair week. picture would taken day fair starts they're setting expensive af house year people show up.

Mississippi really worst state. Nevertheless, Israel mulling lockdown holiday season next month. Yes, Janssen another name single dose Johnson&amp;Johnson vaccine sinovac similar efectiveness take two doses, slightly less AZ many bodies fit trailer?

Wait, 16-50? large median? think that’s case lot places though. Bodies generally transported holding facilities picked later funeral homes/coroner/whatever. places full, happens. thinking need regional respiratory centers clog regular hospitals wiped earth vaccines.

And took 2 centuries! justify 1. CDC dragging feet. Like israeli data clear. 2. We’re literally wasting doses. didn’t deprive immuno compromised folk doses literally expiring. Death rattles thing awful. largely prevents badness. 

Where’s data? “Hearing” something isn’t data. Stop relying anxiety hearsay. Follow data. interview stated condition kept working since 16. read want work health care facilities today, would need get shot. safely stand sidelines say get shot. Exactly.  There's world, Reddit, America prevent it, lessen chances long-term effects, I've heard. I'm thankful that, still worrying. know who's already 8 months? Healthcare workers first responders got back December. decreased immunity happening alongside delta variant really bad combination. What's penalty using fake card monitored?

How many children lost one parents unnecessarily, devastating family often plunging poverty? Yup, luckily rational part brain trusts modern medicine believes vaccines awesome overrides shitty anxiety end getting shots need. bad anxiety attacks get time water fresh air, I'm happy protected. know right thing do, even brain throws tantrum. tested 

How many millions need receive vaccine year see properly tested? 

I'm impression multi-year trials mainly exist due practical realities diseases. is, run horribly rampant, deliberately sending people get infected largely considered medically unethical. vaccinate wait someone present risky scenario could infected, see right? 

Meanwhile, raging pandemic virus risk everpresent. Testing much long-term thing need be. walk door viable risk infection, depending live social circle. 

Testing sounds like pretty casual correlation argument. Understandably, whole FDA approval process well understood, ever year learn it, would seem it. called red herring bring unrelated item. know trying make point I'm really sure is.  vaccinated, transmission end world. Get masks. toward front line shot, got good 4 weeks there. Shit niiice. 

If unvaccinated people also didn’t decide join mask-free party. Christmas present myself, guess. fine That's extreme must pay fair too? great wow. Yes.

Perhaps consider using J&amp;J vaccine booster mRNA vaccines?

Or least study see makes sense? New production that's storage, sure. mean stuff sitting open vials pharmacy freezers. Yeah father immunocompromised cancer treatment especially could never get lie like that. Glad got booster though. Give already  Yes agree, mandates need thing past. opposed giving people proper respect instead coaxing, coercing threatening them? Everyone final say happens bodies, anything beyond brutality, matter misguided may be.

Anyway, I'm gonna argue politics angry nerd. need hyperventilate. Delta around several months now. still saying 70% long delta made big splash. does, though?

I’m guessing anxiety around this. Take breath. Vaccination protects well badness.    Fuck  Easy way get trip jail, faking government documentation. paying attention you. People cannot convinced Google ""CDC"" ""reinfections"" said, 10th call day thing, they're sweating running around block times, think they'll keen ""allies"" say. Beat cops report directly sergeant. officer refuses enforce law property's owner request trespass, need Infowars theory back up. telling they're inconsistent.  Ultravaxxed....with tears eyes since mild infections still give long covid.

People keep saying there's data showing risk high vaccinated nearly data Long COVID focuses unvaccinated. saying get long COVID basically tells nothing; get eaten shark tomorrow, risk actually getting eaten shark tomorrow extremely low. Masking needs stopped. I’ll self administer vaccine monthly that’s takes get us mess guys get fucked size J&amp;J population small need get sick figure thing know mRNA vaccines.

FDA even speculate immunocompromised recipients J&amp;J need booster shot despite evidence. insane. Respect Danny Meyer leading way this. nearing expiration, 110 million far, donated quickly used countries.  Lied Walgreens one state over. Told first shot. Told insurance etc. One Walgreens managed look up. 2nd one gave less info succeeded. bulletproof way would claim immune compromised though couldn’t stomach saying that. 3rd shot moderna feels worse shot 2 worth it. mad favorite anti-vax sub got wrecked?

I hate phrase “check privilege,” least… think position.  New production, sure. mean stuff sitting open vials pharmacy freezers. shelf-life.  Like admitted interview: 

This nurse. wish got storybook ending like end movie Contagion. Vaccines deployed life back normal spread.

The running theories Israel are:

* Fast Waning efficacy months
* Perhaps unique issue vaccines (not stored properly early batches weren’t good - seems unlikely)
* Israel short interval doses, longer one would better off

It seems these, 3rd booster would help. crossing fingers Israel outlier. Dunno 🤷‍♂️ took months fix information issue mine got today. links Google pay guess use like credit card??? I'm really sure states see it. got third shot? How? verify anything?  that's great Ooo thanks! hope like that. I'm really glad bad third time. really feel like going went last time again. obviously really hoping terrible. Everyone loves good comeback story Yes unfortunately peaple stupid. Finally something good 28-3 Regardless think, terms vaccine, currently right decide want get vaccinated one interfere decision. employer goverment.

So right put mortal danger? 

I'm fully vaccinated. I'm also immunocompromised, antibody response. effect, I'm vulnerable virus last year, worse since Delta higher infectious rate I'm much likely need hospitalization. 

If first answer stay inside, been, much possible. I'm person, too, hard reality can't live entire life hermit. medical treatments need visit actual clinics for, mental health keep up, needs groceries home supplies feasible delivered. 

So unvaccinated still present real threat me. unvaccinated family members, friends, people whose ""rights"" defend making world unsafe me. rough couple weeks get covid, I'll wind hospital coffin. 

Where right live exist? pretty bad anxiety, blood clot thing scared getting another J&amp;J dose. major anxiety attack got first shot even knew clots. I'd feel comfortable getting Pfizer Moderna booster, ya know? 

It's funny. choice Pfizer J&amp;J, went J&amp;J avoid second shot second anxiety attack middle Walmart, boom! Turns really make best choice. Clotting, lack information, etc. cops like pretend solders, everyone knows aren't. Falcons something bigger Superbowl. ability claim team smartest entire league.  best t-cell+antibody profile combination. should, theory, similar better. [NYT article seen 2020 vaccine wasn’t available yet let’s get carried away. 
 
But yes, many C19 LODDs 2021 preventable taken damn vaccine. many unnecessary deaths across country. I’ll never understand level ignorance. Ah, less Moderna probably par Pfizer. people others states use that? march stupidity ceased, see. Blatant violation HIPAA

tell idea talking without saying it.  Fucking wild you’re getting downvoted. People got brainwashed HARD past year. Literally people collectively agreeing people vaccine allergy take risk death vaccine shafted society. Except people seem think it’s “Live free die preventable deaths.” Link?  No, exactly opposite result seeing, opposite *was* seeing Iceland Delta got there. vaccine decreases risk Delta infection used, vaccinated cases would small minority, 82% cases. there. Ok scheduling vasectomy. we're middle overdose pandemic dummie. can't even spell ""you're"" , lets learn you. one fake one keep updating you’re vaccinated state, believe need “Key New York” pass rent fair? Nothing important time. increases immunity lasts months trouble.

Like give go herd immunity type trouble. People going get vaccines every 5 months.  cards convenient put wallet given size. wish laminated cards size credit card. Mine kind looks like one cards back library book 90s. scan onto phone jpeg case needed proof really feel comfortable handing phone random restaurant.  Pfizer applied approval booster gen pop today, FYI still need make “no big deal” catch Covid

We already this, called getting vaccinated. say scared. understands intelligent human being. Lack understanding leads fear. Florida can. pulled before. blame her. I'm younger I'd quick fast. anticipate fucking enforce masks. God, idiocy hurts. Nope, they'll give new one. Plenty people forgotten cards went get second shot. Cousin pharmacy tech, said even go back pharmacy got get another need to. Laminated way go. NH meant said live free die. [we 85,000 hospitalized today. last year, number reached november winter surge. it' snot even winter rolled nat 1 :/ Yeah fair call there. Although think far promoting efficacy vaccine serious illness death, sort aggregated data would really go long way. example week showing percentage hospital admissions vaccinated not. 

This kind administrative promotion (or not, vaccines effective) simpler way convince people something, balance risks, almost categorically save life.

I think it’s really sad see people hospital repent say wished vaccinated. Australia around 75% (according sentiment polls) going get vaccinated. Let’s say numbers might inflated somewhat. around 15 % say get one day, till need long term side affects known. It’s group people I’m sure, given simple set statistics, may well swayed. 

Anyway, point is, data need specific all. I’m sure available current climate around media information, clear objective way display efficacy vaccinations would go really long way. medical sector screaming people get jab. feels like brainer. Sure, take risks, mitigate them.

We fly mainstream commercial airlines well-regulated. something design maintenance goes wrong airplane, type plane pulled service problem identified fixed.

Riding cars risk, design safety systems like traction control, automatic braking, seatbelts, anti-lock brakes. try ensure everyone drives basic understanding rules safe driving.

Eating food dangerous. develop rules around safe handling storage foods. require people handle commercial food wash hands cover hair.

Life risk-free. smart societies best reduce risks wherever possible.  mean, toddler literally sneezed snot mouth today... can't say I'm surprised. Florida, Florida, Florida. Europe also arrests jails people teaching dogs classless tricks. uh, united states bit apprehensive comes talking away liberty. liberty shop owner case. Jesus right... Moderna recipient here, damn. mean, I'll gladly take another shot think Moderna brought low enough yet require them. 

I super thankful working figuring Delta crap.  Even vexed people still wear mask indoor public areas. CDC recommends this. Remember means literally every available storage space morgues full. Right… random person scribbled oddly shaped paper. Realized last name one letter off. effective law would come hospital Covid aren’t vaccinated aren’t group unable get vaccine, send home. Great questions, CRP ESR levels high. known inflammatory markers common covid patients. revealed via lab work. Whoever said CT scans chest x rays show inflammation tissue damage severely mistaken. hospital chest x rays performed DAILY covid patients. Luckily, chest x ray post covid looked great. Benefit vaccinated opinion.

As working healthcare, patient ""covid"" patient. reasons. family visited brought her. said negative admitted tested hospital staff found family done. asymptomatic, brush teeth, since able so. contracted gave parents. us vaccinated. said, since covid patient, wear level 3 filtration masks fit like regular surgical masks meaning seepage. wore regular patients pre-vaccination. provided wear non covid rooms.  happens add Kurt Angle mix? Darwinism: Technically, we’ll fewer climate deniers Covid difference shots?

Like would ""Official booster"" different getting another shot whatever now?

I'm Florida 2 shots Pfizer, plenty left since one wants shots, would going CVS wherever getting another shot getting 3rd ""booster"" shot would slightly different vaccine variants whatnot? choice heavily segregate what’s reasoning behind it?! Weird everywhere USA. Canada consistent Labour Day also. much protection go back time punch bat infects patient zero. Mask babies 24/7/365. That’s gonna new yard sign. really. I’ll wear mask I’m expected around folks ask to. I’m back traveling, going again, generally living life. when? could wait something worse delta comes out.

Edit - add want folks comfort level allows please feel comfortable based risk tolerance. already said tip think expected to. society works. always find excuse tip. shown hand already, self-absorbed fucking schmucl.


Also, ""the adolescent you"" makes sense I'd called adolescent first. Otherwise say ""you're acting like adolescent."" know can't even insult people properly. penchant capitalizing words like suggests try win arguments talking people can't get word in, news flash, work text format. keep little temper tantrum making ass yourself. feel sorry mother, carry around nine months grow into... you. Let's clap hands, psychic here. read minds everything! said think masks more? say vaccine available all, hospitals risk overload... I'm virologist, gathering dissenting opinions valuable others interested real discussion.

I'm vaccinated btw I'm pro vaccine general. I've gotten shots, future children, questions asked. I'm also favor mandating state employees nationwide, along anybody goes public school (including college). asshole, even smart - make baseless assumptions based paragraph text. Yayayay! Go you!!!!  Yeah, I'm ready give personal information easily freely. sad unnecessary  business. thought occured might find another line work.

And thought gone away. infectious disease experts ones polly-cized pandemic. making great decision! hate needles process quick painless shots. didn’t even realize happened first. Let person administering shot know fear, trained experts make sure easy experience. 

Also reward something small! Facing fear huge deal live San Jose drive San Francisco start next week requiring vaccination proof enter gym. Others said it, I'll confirm -- injection needle tiny one least painful shots I've ever had. even realize done. fine :).  anything delta variant? They’ve proven viral load similar non vaccinated finally reading hitting villages. know avoided somehow mutation, may ask? Factor V Leiden multiple clots pulmonary embolism years. I'm blood thinners life now. taking blood thinners time Covid? I'm always curious there's enough studies it. wonder Covid affects people like us differently somehow negate effects blood thinner point enough cause clotting regardless (which kind terrifying, mind always wanders worst case scenarios...) Don’t that. Insurance deny coverage, careful Agreed. However, prevent exposure turning severe case know exposed, that’s little hopeful Yes, even dumbasses cluttering states fleeing fallout. OK, question deserves better answer. Parents moat around baby. need deepest widest moat possibly can. means vaccine, masks, distancing, works. expose baby babies. Parents lot keep beautiful babies becoming superspreaders.  enough pcr soon enough rapid... wow Good know, thanks. impression dengue ADE lot worse that, find CFR anywhere secondary infection causes it. 

While bad, 1.5x increase would end world (in unlikely event occur). go move. Everyone disagrees arguments child adolescent. guess keeps challenging Dunning–Kruger effect. vote both. comes little surprise.   2 days that's still lot daily rate  1000 deaths reported Florida week, day. following week 1400.  It’s primary violation states, get pulled speeding you’re wearing seat belt, get ticket it. can’t get seatbelt though. would actually make sense executive order, since dress codes harm anyone. stuff stupid going kill kids can't vaccinated yet. That’s pretty convoluted way saying abuse. Maff rly hrd  Whataboutism finest.  go Walgreens, say qualify booster FDA recently approved that's it? remember beginning vaccines approved waves could go online pick high risk condition approved, smoking one.  OK. good one. Enjoy evening. Man ATL? weeks ago mask sight. persistently masked person wherever went aside airport. Lol. Remember last mind. accept COVID going endemic. It’s time especially countries everyone chance vaccination return normal accept new reality. *cries Albertan* NYC went get first fake ID college yea definitely happen.   Thank you. Wow expect Atlanta first Seahawks needed cut one guy done like 2 months ago. would probably lawsuit waiting... Yes also worried unvaccinated ~~revenue sources~~ members would catch COVID die therefore also longer bring money?  Copying pasting response comment booster shots below:

I’m excited this, means immunity presumably going start wearing en masse, it’s going hard convince people could barely persuaded get vaccinated first place need get another shot. I’m mistaken, going facing long difficult uphill battle. I’m trying doom-and-gloom, don’t see much reason optimistic situation come, anyone “bright side” countervailing view share, please do. got pretty nasty side effects J&amp;J. Wild chills fever New research CDC actually indicates twice likely catch COVID already bro. almost feels like concerted effort get everyone take mRNA forget single dose shot article commenting said majority disease murder. still personal health decision regardless whether ""educated"" matter not. Tell me, long term risks/effects various COVID vaccines? mean, clearly must educated matter, right?  knew effectiveness would wane time enough people get vaccinated, least realistic possibility. They've talking boosters vaccines even available. could care less unvaccinated they’ll do. Give booster dose. No, isn’t. Coronaviruses mutate quickly - far flu - you’re never going able vaccinate different strains. you’re creating distributing vaccine strain A, B, C, D, E shown up. Same, usually need boost around holidays anyway. moron. guess praying ""god"" really working needs beg vaccines. 

Unfortunately, religious nut world sending followers demise. infringement privacy demand present medical records get privately owned grocery store policy matter. state overstepping authority going get worse, recognize extremely naive. silver lining breakthrough infections personally know people got MRNA vaccine. I'm sure happens know anyone got JnJ breakthrough infection. Deer too. SaY axe. one question have---will 2 doses still count ""fully vaccinated"" 3 become new ""fully vax"" Articles written constantly it, personal vendetta COVID coverage absolutely asinine given prominence right I'm front line medical worker, vaccinated December 23. go ahead get booster? south getting delta booster fun way Omg too. Thanks laugh!  triggered anyway? I'm going say it: gave much credit nurses ""heroes"" thing. Doctors general deserve praise more.

Nurses, hand, without disparaging individual person, gross generalization, suck. disappointing number turned antivaxers spreading shit, enforced profession, sounds medically informed, isn't.

I mean absolutely offense nurses save lives daily part job worked much possible urge people get vaccinated. Upgrade 6G speeds let's goooo lol seriously. I'm hoping 3 \*worse\* dose 2 believe right live outweighs individuals' life freedom, Everyone live life sees fit harming another.

These contradictory statements we're talking someone using ""freedom"" rationalization take precautions risking infection spreading disease pandemic. 

Your whole argument delicately balanced notion personal liberties must never infringed. infringe time society, public good outweighs right whatever damn well please case. different, we've half year significant number people turning noses vaccine, obvious can't common sense thing much less others. 

If someone disabilities live US, aided ADA, law deliberately carved give right access precedence someone else's right employ/teach/service/build/etc however please. law passed, proved someone direct deliberate harm exclusion, public good inclusive outweighed value someone else's supposed liberties. 

You've bent others self ego existing someone disabilities. Every sloped curb, every electric door opener, every low counter, every sign language interpreter, every braille sign, every dedicated parking bathroom stall that's installed intended you, me, anyone else disabled equal access society. may chosen that, done name regardless. 

I think we're beyond silly notions ideological purity now. That’s design. feel you. gonna keep getting boosters encouraging friends family. That's would heartbeat lifetime feeling. Universal Healthcare, baby!

Oh immunity covid pretty cool, too.   second shot Pfizer, laid bed 5 days extreme fatigue. could sleep... Hope booster bad, I'm gonna lie scary. 100 microgram dose probably bit sketchy re: side effects small 12 year olds (not deadly anything, likely pleasant) CDC guidance different vaccines given within 2 weeks other. take one drug another one later. got both. what's big deal? free available everywhere. body tough there's zero risk. we're going need boosters perpetuity anyway.

also leaving room nuance rant rules. sometimes rules make sense sometimes don't. us weigh case.  Pediatric ICU beds full, think that’s going turn out? that's horrifying would shocked &lt;12 crosses 25% Makes hipster vaxxer. love we're straight guinea piggin right lmao  guy getting downvote? someone fully vaccinated chooses get booster despite eligible longer considered fully vaccinated?   San Francisco black people least vaccinated racial group? Lol Ya bad Canada donated 40 million doses now. Maybe thrown away almost zero side effects J&amp;J April. slight headache bit tired. Pfizer shot knocked ass. Got around 10am 12 hours later fever, chills, body aches. Tossed turned night. Bad arm pain. Next day horrible headache. last 24 hrs it. issues since. lady smart enough nurse? Yup review outdoor dining codes well seeing what's happening around you? 50% population would refuse use products could effective continue get sick virus.   Hope get tickets laker game. time season existing vaccines address known variants far nyc city agency yes. Every restaurant posted letter grade well. 

They sample customers view staff checking. 

Same way bars get audited checking ids correct. New Orleans first believe. several immunizations right routinely get boosters. i.e. Tetanus, Influenza, ect. need question efficacy COVID immunization means. There’s several, you’re real stickler, you’re waiting results Correct. That's stuff vaccine 99% effective looking December data bad reporting lmao that's embarrassing. 

They coulda vaccinated months ago. Interesting stuff sounds exactly like they've telling us mRNA vaccines. never claim reinfection common severe.  Depends death... Holy fuck I'm dying! amazing! someone gets 2 Pfizer 2 moderna 2 AZ 1 J&amp;J? new superhero Vaxman That’s 2 full high schools single day, god. No, host ask giving table. audit customers venue.

When health inspector measures food temperature they're talking customers big famous national parks like Yellowstone &amp; Yosemite extensive museum galleries detailing history, geology, flora, fauna etc. concessions eateries get packed peak hours. tourist centers cater tour buses bring throngs day-trippers. course real hikers &amp; backpackers avoid areas, literally like plague. worse flu common cold thing considered ""taboo"" first place. continues remain way people go ""back normal"" anyways, nothing change virus makes less taboo rather willingness accept risk deal prolonged sickness. 

The person replied framed future COVID meaning typical person bed ""a day two"" would seem imply COVID become like flu even telling envision future actually COVID still worse (meaning us adapt virus ratger virus adapting us). whole point argue current actions what's going make envision future unfolding reality (COVID still worse flu deal it) opposed virus adapting way ease discomfort prospects catching (it becomes like flu feelings towards match view catching flu). ^ insight type person would articulate this, check user's past comments certain subreddits. answer question, responsible public health. certainly situation would upset take covid seriously. necessarily translate forcing vaccinations.

Upset even begin cover it. 

But agree measures taken preserve public health, bridge far mandate vaccinations, what's recommendation? 

It seems clear people bare minimum protect others personal choice. wasn’t exactly truthful. got J&amp;J shot DC Pfizer VA, live. pharmacist asked vaccinated already said no. wasn’t showing VA records received one yet gave me. feel bit bad clearly isn’t shortage. already federal crime, [18 U.S. Code § punishable fine and/or 5 years prison. least charge people want. first line February. immunity fading  Late party—where’s ‘muh freedom’ stans at? Can’t wait see public freak outs   feel fine now. Shore shoulder 2.5 days, first night chills, 2nd day body aches soreness(as intense workout played rugby match previous day, tired. 3rd day slight arm soreness.  think choosing paint people different opinion, poor light.

If respect peoples opinions never respect yours, unable productive conversation.

I believe vaccine extremely beneficial safe most, important able talk disagree. medical bill savings, like paid get vaccine! We're windows phone world believe 3 safe elderly, could choose them, I'd want Moderna. elderly relatives (mom, aunt, uncle - 70s, serious health conditions) got Moderna well. Dad blame it, Billy. Take upvote. also CDC   That's remote classes looked like whole last year (in Utah). Majority population chose person school, minority students chose remote afterthought. Kids little instruction, basically assignments online. Complete joke. hope behind next year :/ Good you. Hopefully people quit, think know what’s really going happen. They’ll probably get sick. frankly I’m it. 

Your boss sounds like twat. husband got vaccinated Jan, I’m pregnant one year old home. want boosters ASAP. works pharmacy said get one, makes consider even more. heard considering using star constellations. mRNA robust vaccine. adapted extremely quickly efficiently. 

The issue speed variant mutation creating variants almost certainly outpace.  No.. haven’t gotten 3 flu shots span 18 months struggle understand logic anti-vaxxers even vaccine-hesitant, perspective could off.

The vaccinations pandemic come control. ~270 day population 21.5 x8-x12 daily rate Western countries per population. Wtf I’m curious immunity people who’ve COVID gotten vaccinated after. Given varying time doses affect immune response, wonder there’s similar sweet spot time COVID infection vaccine (or booster) would provide protection.   Heard Dana Carvey reading really hope so.

Also common people, medical industry seen predatory financial purposes. easy think FDA sitting around might get paid it. maybe insidious plan keep COVID going plan financial gains 🤷🏻‍♂️. wholly impossible, unless evidence know it, I'll trust FDA knows doing.

Yeah, reckon ready that. actually sense case/death numbers might look like highly vaccinated population. Can't save stupid. going full level 4 lockdown midnight tonight, majority New Zealand level 3 days, Auckland Coromandel level 4 7 days, could obviously change information comes hand. Level 4 means everyone must stay home leave essentials (groceries, doctor etc.) think going keep getting waves numbers seriously ill get lower every wave. last wave friends getting sick testing positive symptoms. serious case all. case first waves.  Heart inflammation big one, myocarditis developed younger recipients vaccine. Including Delta? literally said “We go Hard Fast, Light Long. look Sydney.”

There also needs actual discussion long term plan here. far, vague talk borders might reopen point, whilst claiming elimination strategy ""indefinite"" confused contradictory. 

IMO, setting clear goals mature discussion long term strategy would encourage vaccination, prepare people realistic end goals.

In addition that, think lot people society overreacting fact still transmit virus even vaccinated. according [this ""Researchers also said fully vaccinated people less likely transmit virus others"". even healthy, still transmit virus, despite asymptomatic, less chance transmitting vaccine.

It's incredibly resource-intensive stressful involved, even patients completely asymptomatic. yes, even patients vaccinated.

The question whether point determine cost-benefit calculation makes longer worthwhile so. already blaming another enemy. Pro-vaccine pro-lockdown people. sure come catchy name us. split amongst children blame us right keeping lockdown. already request. Nobody going spend time verifying who's immunocompromised not, like places verifying first dose leading million boosters given last week.   mean yeah, sure dictate economic system, also choose go back eating hand picked fruits, using wood heat homes moving foot horses only. point?   relatively healthy 30-year old vaccinated April want booster now.

If get booster soon, think works well. There's reason MMR, HepB, varicella vaccines wait period 2nd shot (or 3rd case HepB) Anything thoughts prayers. know work long term.

We're shutting right clear transmission link; know came we're pausing everything couple days figure quarantine people link. 

Frankly, hospital infrastructure able handle massive outbreak without buffer high immunization. know that, interested trying fool believing otherwise. light reality, best thing get everyone jabbed. That's correct - NZder people know borders can't locked forever. 3 days unless live Auckland Coromandel. it’s 7 days. said, even 7 days really short time grand scheme pandemic.

No. sustainable strategy long term get much population vaccinated possible order mitigate illnesses deaths inevitably occur open borders. we're close level yet are, best way try prevent becoming Australia 2.0

Frankly, hospital infrastructure able handle massive outbreak without buffer high immunization. Yeah sure, countries like Afghanistan Syria locked better. good data Delta variant cause?

1) outcompeted variants one found infected people

2) vaccines designed prevent severe disease, infection. definitely appear impede infection. PCR tests show viral mRNA, whether coming actively replicating virus destroyed viral particles. 

3) Antibodies naturally wane vaccine. normal. Vaccines provide initial exposure defend actually exposed. 

There's epidemiological data spread, assumptions transmission, etc tested laboratory setting far know. Behavior drastically changed (loosened) since vaccines first distributed, MUST accounted for. using vaccine booster patch poor initial rollout lack comprehensive strategy. hardest hit areas ones low initial dose - focus efforts booster need one? lock early cases spiral. wait 1 case turn 2000 Everyone's going get eventually anyway.

Ideally they've economic harm country covid will.

We've already true all.
I can't believe people still making blatently untrue arguments 18 months line. True leadership.
Being reactive letting virus spread give bigger economic damage. Hep B vaccine, people US routinely get, 3-dose regimen. submit university back. Vaccines need boosters new idea all. Hey, that's wrong. blame UPS guy FedEx guy.  going start burning bodies mass graves anti vaxxors get clue?  It’s far less cruel ignore patients actually need care say cardiac incidents, car crashes etc booster dose elicited significantly higher antibody response initial strain coronavirus Delta Beta variants, compared seen among people got two doses. booster dose seemed equally protective Delta Beta variants original coronavirus.  60% gravely ill patients fully vaccinated.

With nearly entire high-risk population fully vaccinated, really mean much. practice data Israel shows unvaccinated individuals 5x-8x likely become gravely ill vaccinated individuals. Vaccine efficacy severe illness Israel still 90%. anyone explain big emphasis around booster shots antibody counts? memory cells eliviate need exactly (antibody count drops eventually, memory cells cause production more, virus reappears)?  Yeah sucks get logic it. They're freezing Auckland try figure came since there's likely transmission link, they're freezing everyone else quarter Auckland melt away countryside avoid lockdown possibly take unknown transmission chain them. NOPE What's maths 4 doses? Asking friend. struggle express much loathe Clive Palmer  C would necessary countries would done B too.

It's like need arrange medical records transfer, simple checking 'I'm immunocompromised' box.

Also tiny island nation, unfortunately occupied country wants everything go back normal matter what. away testing mistake. never gotten point community spread. Zealand country world handling pandemic correctly.

I'm tired hearing this. true.

NZ's approach pretty simple itself:

a. lock hard early

b. get zero cases made sure eradicated covid locally

c. keep borders closed aggressively trace every single case slips cracks.

Now, many countries step b. Problem is, many countries afford step c (as in, seal world indefinitely) without completely wrecking economy point covid spike would beneficial. mean, country like Slovenia indeed eradicated covid around May 2020, done? small country middle Europe whose entire economy based heavy daily exchanges neighbouring countries. last unless everyone else around board - even less realistic.

There reason pretty much every country world outside New Zealand even tried eradication approach failed. Getting zero cases problem, maintaining zero cases is. far, New Zealand, China still pursuing strategy - even entire 1984 style surveillance apparatus draconian border policies still got several outbreaks yet contain completely, knowing even they're successful time round cannot long term strategy.

August 2021 still random ""we done like nz"" pops out. frustrates me. Many countries luxury first place. Italy locked harder Nz two months straight still cases time covid endemic point. done? lock infinity beyond delusional hope reaching zero cases import first truck drivers coming Germany? Love logic: ""I already covid antibodies, need vaccine"" gets covid second time: ""now I'm even protected!""

But clear he's talking sick COVID, he's saying stuck hallway (and article talks COVID taking beds Florida hospitals).

The whole thing reads like article wanted talk half FL beds taken COVID, hunting quote med staff want expand situation talking about.  Given vertical rise case counts hospitalizations, fast arterial bleed US. get happen. Many countries opened still getting deaths Australia would comfortable with, even high peak.

I think need accept community. want avoid large numbers hospitalisations deaths. we're aiming 80% vaccination rate. reckon eventually exceed people keen get jab. may depend extent post vaccine symptoms. wife mild effects, headache, mom count sick hell day two. never get high enough vaccine rates stop Delta huge issue you. less immunity nation even vulnerable vaccine escape. Vaccine uptake lower seen deadly virus first hand

Not saying NZ done bad. Obviously not. whilst europe's worst behind us, way way worse come. think usually test twice annoucing positive community case puts country lockdown personal able job touring lighting designer concerts again, also perk protecting others virus. sorry loss, Yoda….  Good leadership. Vietnam Australia examples proactive comes delta. plan seems match people already got, extenuating circumstances (not sure would be). deal exponential growth! They're correct responding immediately instead waiting see large trends cases. Apparently NZ politicians actually studied math. Unlike USA politicians 'wait see trends go"", worse (DeSantis, Abbot others) prevent states using protections. Gosh, wish. fun first time around, decided again. headlines exactly dealing last year.  Astra Zeneca always two-shot regimen though. feel like vaxxed keep getting anti vaxxers die off, really sad So, according you.. work mailservices package delivery intelligent? Lesson also learnt Australia restrictions alone cannot beat delta - need right top contact tracing too. 1 case many hundreds contacts (they tend go contacts contacts), quite enough work own. 170 days precise Take tums beforehand chase Krispy  I'm disagreeing decision ethically dubious lot ways, also consider people getting vaccinated US there's lot doses already taken ice expire need go people's arms. problem administered boosters. I’m NYer. forgot last night went, custom, get beer laundry dryer. get vax app get in. took 10 mins I’ve never happy inconvenience. Whys New Zealand's vaccination rate low ? Barely 18% fully vaxed right ? What's issue ? small rich country rates much much higher. Might false positive ?  think NZ afraid tbh. 

Same Western Australia. Whereas New South Wales keen open soon hit vaccination targets. normal circumstances, even early 2016, I'd agree you. 

 

However, damage done politicization public health (and government institutions) , well incompetent right negligent pandemic response last administration changed field. I'm afraid damage done take decades fix, all. logic applied food safety. 3 7 days shocked. 7 days cases end another lockdown. announcement tonight said positive case infectious since Thursday. Six days plenty time people travel around country. friggin rip-off!! Alabama Mississippi battle every year worst state US.

I'm glad nausea, odds slightly higher mRNA shots. Thanks. Idk I’m getting downvoted seeking information.. year covid: I’m ready date!
A month later: Oh shit!!! worries I’m ugly anyway. starting feel like think saving world, living part world, say fundamentally thing changing names, even contagious COVID That’s interesting. often kids tested exposure? How's food safety?  3-4 weeks shots likely best timeline giving protection shots first place, time study anything else. finished children antivaxxers. Everyone knows second shot knocks people butt 24 hours. first shot little effect most. 

Will booster like first shot, like 2nd? maybe even continuation worse reactions, even worse 2nd?

I’ll definitely get I’m supposed to. like knowing expect. Covid last summer. 

Got vaccine spring. 

No way I’m getting booster. felt 5x worse day vaccine Covid. 

When Covid lost taste, tired fever couple days. Pretty mild overall. 

Day second dose Pfizer vaccine constant pain, felt like worst hangover life terrible headaches light sensitivity. way I’m again. people NZ taking this?

Like actually listen paper lockdown 30-50% people ignore it(aka American model)? luck infections lead anywhere work JJ? JJ weeks later Pfizer 3/4 weeks Pfizer 2nd dose? Well go get booster there. least low vaccination rate means higher odds winning raffle prizes!  Though zero Covid cases obviously ideal it’s still unrealistic weigh important factors well country, it’s people economy implement lockdowns inevitably gonna long term commitment. I’m starting college US (CA exact) person week imagine insane would schools shut 1 reported Covid case campus (which several reported cases campus nearly ghost town summer semester starts). It’s inevitable transmission degree point it’s mitigation pushing vaccines keeping health measures like masks social distancing. country’s people economy manage lockdowns matter ridiculous reason it. it’s different places like US even developing nations imagine strong implications small countries like New Zealand larger population would enable economies scale, US could get cost per person even lower.   says 2 days cases think 3.

heres last 3 days CDC FL

Should also noted 7 day rolling avg went little bit Friday Saturday back little Sunday (but still lower Fridays), first time ticked comparing day day. rise infections comes schools head back classroom.

Boy ain't hell coincidence. fate sure cruel mistress, eh Tennessee?

It's like what's needed painfully obvious, one shouting last year more. Still though, could worse. could Botswana. Florida. much rules citizen buy in. get kids 12 vaccinated USA (hopefully fall) going something learn accept x number deaths per year from, like flu such, life go back normal people. Looks like Florida great place researchers study effects COVID (acute Long COVID) kids. way, Floridians warned DeSantis views. manufacturers raised lot fuss off-label use.

I wonder that’s shorter regimens fully studied didn’t want people blaming spacing reduced efficacy. vaccines move in, number infections come less relevant continue assume vaccinated people get sick (or even symptomatic). I'm discounting fact covid long-term effects even without symptoms, given Covid going away, need start focusing (a) getting vaccines people's arms, (b) reducing hospitalizations death. vaccinated sane protesting governor Alabama Mississippi take action? guess feel safe aren’t otherwise opposed governors’ idiotic policies. Vaccination masking outgrowth political views ignorance.

If people speaking governors, basically complicit point. 

I’m envisioning wealthy vaccinated places like Huntsville feeling safe world. get vaccination cards laminated preserve longer? long would ink last? I'm first dose vaccinated Pfizer waiting second one. little afraid last news Israel. got infected vaccination :(( hope vaccination right way win.

What? take long single team get there? Lord rings moving tho  Frankly appalled think remotely appropriate approach single reported COVID case, don’t seem realize implications lockdowns apparently understand severity virus especially among highly vaccinated population.

Legitimately voters ones put people charge. that's true need tetanus shot. full regiment vast majority already provides pretty decent protection, I'm much less worried people refused can't get vaccines, especially even make hospital non vaccine treatments, staffing critically short beds, treatment could well delayed unavailable.   superspreader road race downtown Nashville week ahalf ago. boosters going 3rd shot original vaccine? created specifically fight new variants? understanding current vaccines created original COVID strain. could wrong see additional shot original shot provides much value. Zero Covid like, impossible. It’ll like going “zero common cold”, since come virus.

Why don’t NZ Australia high vaccination rate yet? That’s almost inexcusable affluent nation point. two shots (Pfizer) don’t know I’ll take third. problem masking continuing safe. 

But it’s one feelings took 2 shots gave vaccine chance? studies showing protections barely last 8 months, many shots wanting get next however long? 

I’m definitely anti vax, think everyone get shot. I’m ready jump line third, idk starts seeing bizarre me. emergency acknowledge it.   could pickup tetanus, HEP, another booster. Many standard childhood vaccines need boosters every 10 years adults too. Roll Tide (of Covid).  wish comment higher up.


if im supposed get booster, i'll get it. god damn feel guilty hell entire swaths world havent single shot yet :( Same, even got vaccination covid. promised I’d send back. homeschooled last year mentally suffered lack interaction kids. wonder could example kind animal acting reservoir, like, Covid jumped kind animal NZ cases circulating jumped back guy... possible? Jab baby!   headlines start reporting, “we’re running out!,” could see lot unvaccinated people running nearest CVS. theory, though.

Your theory might hold true running out. We're going stockpiling years.  Florida also hit tropical storm 1-2 days ago many testing centers closed period. appears GP. positivity rates doing? continuing rise say may true. started flatten hopefully peak. Incoming DeSantis say ever. everyone Vaccinated not? Monday, Iraan-Sheffield ISD, district 80 miles south Midland, announced would shut three campuses starting Tuesday, keeping 338 students home Aug. 30. … virtual remote learning made available Bloomburg Waskom ISDs — two small districts East Texas borders Arkansas Louisiana, respectively — told families Sunday would hold classes week campuses. … Waskom ISD closed elementary school Aug. 20, unable properly staff campus number COVID-positive staff members location… Albany County NY. 42% positives vaxxed, 20-somethings driving cases meant be. rollout complete.  one seriously thinks requiring proof vax things gonna long-term thing right?

I sincerely hope not. don’t want keep getting shot every year get things.

“Oops sorry didn’t get booster even though got two main doses, game you” really hope aren’t going force us get second J&amp;J vaccine considered fully vaccinated. hope least opportunity get one others.  start early emergency use like USA. NZ Australia 4 months behind rollout point catching fast. Ugh. I'm sorry. :( knowledge every single family know done Disney recently brought home Covid, even ones stayed masked 24/7 everything right. encouraging. exact symptoms Pfizer shots. Looking getting booster week. yearly checkup Friday thinking asking give one. auto immune disorder, started taking immunosuppressants yet. Actually got approved waiting specialty pharmacy fill order. 8 months 2nd dose 9/21 I'd ideally like get booster I'm suppressing immune system, I'm hoping go ahead give booster.  stop people drinking driving

Suggestions? 8/10 method sending CDC changed, would create artifacts period definitely hear saying, playing devils advocate. meant add comment lot mind guess didn't. 

I know right answer is, dont think mandate. guess I'm voicing people actually politicizing vaccine (as getting spite left), getting legitimate medical concerns. 

I'll give situation example. I'm vaccinated, spouse not. allergic seems everything sun, thats exaggeration. body sensitive everything puts it. could go great detail horror stories it... works federal government job mostly wfh mandated vaccine. right thing got medical exemption doctor (who pro vaccine) concerned might happen gets it. work flat ignored exemption terminated her. spent thousands dollars lawyer could get job back. We're broke reason. coworkers worked 20 years medical exemptions job now

I guess fear mandate is, seeing federal government job handled it, federal government know mandate vaccine properly, really going screw people like spouse trying right thing. 

She said would get sees long term effects. many unknowns right now. Stop letting unvaccinated idiots get treated hospitals. vaccinated individual, demand access hospital bed suffer emergency need emergency treatment. Ha! Well probably well protected :)

I chills fever broke overnight. tired next couple days afterwards. 

I really think robust immune response driven adeno pseudovirus infecting cells vaccine works well despite second dose. J&amp;J vaccine knocked completely three days. could hardly muster strength energy take kids school. 1. Brazil geopolitical enemies.   
2. technical difficulty negotiating vaccine. Pfizer sent 100 emails offering vaccines $10, never answered. current vaccines effective severe disease death, even Delta. trying say that, noting would expect require vax card proof enter building vaccines still provide strong protection serious illness, boosters coming. obviously thats best way protect yourself, feel need protection beyond that, n95 mask. still feel need stay home isolate 2 3 shots plus n95 mask, imo thats totally unreasonable basing public policy unreasonable concerns like that. 

if saw kind reasonable endgame here, might feel differently, doubt much reach % vaccinations needed get rid covid reach herd immunity, virus continue spawn new variants, least awhile, cant restrictions forever, or, imo, even years.

widely available free vaccines, vaccine requirements non-essential indoor activities, widely available, cheap n95 masks seems like best do, least im standing now. wouldn’t say third shot making violently ill.   
Third shot administered less 24 hours ago me. 5 hours shot, started feeling sore joints tired. night, approximately 10 hours after, flu like symptoms started. Cold/flu meds making manageable. depends medication. delayed methotrexate 2nd dose remicade.

My opinion don’t care. fully vaxed end January worked pharmacy time. I've since let go longer healthcare worker, I'm wondering leaves me, 8 months way people age bracket now. Thanks, makes sense. Literally misinformation can’t predict future think it’s unlikely virus able evolve point frequent vaccines needed combat new variants

There constraints virus binds host receptor future strains going constraints else virus won’t work anymore, it’s pretty likely least lifelong protection maintained new strains even current vaccines. would probably ideal booster designed delta variant really depends quickly safety could determined production ramped  ever happen?!?!? /s  Hopefully pediatric dr, get end game here, mind? Certainly can't keep shutting entire country every single time one person gets disease literally endemic. I'm curious - what's way out? ""Just one week new school year, 5,599 students 316 employees Hillsborough County isolated quarantined COVID cases continue rise. 
That's equivalent 2.4 percent student population county. 
Isolation refers individuals tested positive COVID-19 quarantine refers close contact positive case. 
The Hillsborough County School Board hold Emergency School Board Meeting Wednesday, August 18, 1 p.m.-3:30 p.m. School Board Auditorium discuss latest district COVID-19 impact best way mitigate spread virus, including mandatory face coverings students staff. 
The current policy Hillsborough County masks mandated students, opt-out provision."" I’d argue neither late early pandemic. believe we’re transitioning disease endemic thing like flu, hopefully within nearish future, number vaccinated previously infected individuals future outbreaks much less severe. lol guy... ""we can't 100% guarantee expiring doses used world's vulnerable population, enough go around anyway, therefore talk them.""

&amp;#x200B;

That's like saying grocery stores throw away expired food instead giving away, lot make people hungriest world. Yes, delayed methotrexate week 2nd dose (unfortunately first) Remicade she’s on, normal, weirdly doesn’t effect antibodies way. think it’s biological?

I asking start seeing rising cases measles, do. 
The problem uveitis arthritis seems come back rather quickly we’re late infusions. it’s really hard clear up. don’t like delaying meds. 
It’s catch 22… measles higher consequence, probably worth risk. lot nuance completely lost this. much risk things locked locked down. People vaccinated take risks vaccinated. Etc etc. mean people say ""lmao let states die out"" *everyone* antivax/etc

If 50% state is, people think say ""lmao let die"" without feeling guilt lack empathy 50%?

Making broad generalizations help anyone. States big. Socio-political shit complex. States one giant hivemind everyone thinks same. That's trying say.

-Under-5s, brands: add 4-6 weeks timelines.

This experience Pfizer shots far. Congrats! Yes, way prevent this.  LGBT people anything people anti-unvaccinated choice? Even sick days, people weeks weeks worth. get kid gets it? Suddenly need 10+ sick days. next month get norovirus showing work puking sick days. pretty hard find things criticize New Zeeland response.

They shut 1 case... breakthrough cases even high levels vaccination. live Covid forever. Yeah, need look Israel see A.) Pfizer breakthrough cases quite common also B.) Pfizer still least preventing ton hospitalization death. 

We gotta, to, need to, absolutely must come vaccines crimp transmission variants better. I'm really hoping second gen vaccines use front. 

Hundreds millions people infected given moment forever sustainable long term. rips healthcare system drives mutations like crazy. 

Like, yes, virus always us, probably can't vaccinate total extinction, always going cause absolute batshit roaring waves incredibly deep shit. sure false positive? Yet Oregon reported July 1 5 positive tests someone fully vaccinated. 20%. Antimask parents area telling kids, us Rosa Parks moment."" Public comments School Board meetings interesting. One woman called mandate ""Luciferian"" another seriously thinks kids facial deformities masks. accurate scientific point made low death numbers among kids, ignore rising hospitalizations multi symptom inflammatory disease. best part think School Board listening constituents, prior Governor issuing mandate, caved gave opt masks. Barely 10% kids opted wearing masks, lot kids valid medical reasons. parents delusional. know inflammation? symptoms? According something saw earlier, administration likely waiting hear NIH studies mixing vaccines. completed dead? Nice, I'm due one December. little Christmas gift myself. can't read article, 8 months first second shot? AKrowdy right. Good. could kept hospitals ICU beds (willingly unvaccinated only, kids medically can't exempt). took 2 years 500 children dying meningitis bumped age group 11-55 2-55. Absolutely expected, sign + it’s effective preventing serious illness. However still catch it, still spread it, still cause illness people cause complications. long allow thing spread mutate control never end. That's works. Thank asking.
She day 14 well. scary hell family go it. May family safe experience  [26 deaths total, that's 5 per 1 thought would case 2nd shot got knocked ass couple days. Depending got it, could go different location offering incentives. far ethics getting another vaccine?? They're literally throwing around millions vaccine doses away America anyway.   Epitopes various variants remained unchanged still great protection serious disease death. I'm sure would suggest.. let run wild country? pretty hard find things criticize New Zeeland response. Yeah I'm think mom thing. 70's vaccinated February immunocompromised. I'm still worried though. SC vaccinated, honestly numbers little troubling. 20% deaths vaccinated? Wish America reasonable. lot people first shot parts world desperately need one. variants making boosters for, coming areas without vaccines. Make make sense. I'll honest, got first dose yesterday need work. see coming mandatory near future. collapsed 10 minutes it, know need second one work, unless make need third part society I'm going nowhere near it. That's convincing enough me. Thank you! Via Zoom, even patience attempt... agree children need access vaccine ASAP, trials run pharmaceutical companies, still ongoing. I.e. FDA probably data outside Pfizer Phase 1 trial results. think Phase 1 around 1000 participants. Phase 2/3 around 3500 participants, second shot administered mid-July. FDA requested increase number participants due recent concerns myocarditis. Pfizer issues recruiting participants. Moderna pediatric trial probably several months behind Pfizer's.  everyone knows national guard medically trained to...um...carry stretchers? I’ll put way: according source particular vaccine chance cause blood clots. Right now, get vaccine anywhere, questions asked. informed person reach primary care, primary care research person’s medical history determine certain vaccine right them. uninformed person may reach out, whatever reason, potentially cause harm good. 

For moment, forget what’s going COVID tell due diligence journalist wrong. Today: 603,000 total shots, 334,000 first shots.

Compared last week, -18,000, slight drop total shots, -90,000 first shots. But, Tuesday historically lowest reporting number day week.

Stats today: 50 states 50% one dose rate 12 older, handful states reaching 80% first dose rate. time vaccinate country, far different variant circulating (like we're seeing now). start over.

This terrible strategy. certain that's true Mr. Trollface? son turns 12 9/7, also first day school. I'd love level protection school starts Dont regret, mRNA shit unknown causing lot people AI problems months road. got J&amp;J proven method, NEVER get mRNA 🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑 Advised who?   Pfizer would happy, they'll recommend weekly stakeholders exit strategy, vaccinate entire population. smart country vaccinates population novel virus. Stupid question: vaccine actually called vaccine? definition vaccine states vaccine provides immunity one multiple diseases, COVID vaccine provide immunity. booster shots sounds like treatment vaccine. someone please educate me? (Fully vaxxed btw, don’t want sound like antivaxxer) Finally!  Sorry bud, far confident stupid sound. true communist super powers today, one ever existed outrageously cruel, extremely shitty place live, collapsed couple decades. even then, always second to...capitalist USA. Please stop spreading contagious idiocy.  kidding? wanted liberty death gave both. Big conservative win. They'll vote probably 2024 primary. time, American Academy Pediatrics asking hurry want kids getting sick, either. ever since start vaccinations, people keep referring fever/chill/headaches/fatigue last days etc side effects vaccine. 

These side effects, they're literally intended effect stimulating immune system mount defense. That's they're meant do. say side effects covid fever/chill/fatigue, that's does. 

It probably would've done good PR work frame side-effects vaccine. 

Just venting void.  us got Pfizer/Moderna first time around looking J&amp;J booster?  NY, similar experience. exposed someone died COVID vaccine available. feeling well found person hospitalized time naturally went CVS get tested drive thru. test, thankfully, negative, I'm looking final bill little $100. would / people researched adenovirus vector vaccines also recommend pfizer booster, us jnj good wait? asked almost 11yo wanted go another state (because state tracks gets registry) pretend older brother. said would dishonest would wait.

I'm curious think 137,000 people going manage staffing military hospitals *and* civilian ones. Anyway, point. point ramp efforts help vaccinate world. right diverting booster shots 3rd world countries much. yes, gesture, one contempt. Let die then. Good!
How refuse science reason, turn science reason death comes knocking  completely unacceptable. Punish people causing problem. Deprioritize non-vaccinated persons COVID treatment.  Ah, Malcolm Tucker rendition carrot-and-stick. like it. read exactly like explained it. people really misunderstanding it? That's pretty naïve. Delta spread every country named NZ. spread open, going stopped.

The current strategy works, NZ going closed forever. focus lack vaccines, patting back living isolated island.   ""The analysis peer-reviewed"" 

lol problem here. That’s 5 trailers souls going straight Baby Jeebus. 

And live eternity infinite bliss, singing songs praise, eating endless grapes copulating infinite virgins. That’s pretty damn good outcome ask me. 

This assumes Christians belonged right church course. got third shot, nearly bad second one slightly worse first. hope get quickly. Unfortunately might business decision. certain areas, bet lot money made anti-vax parents. doctors US swear oath? country (Italy) would illegal. doctor denies treatment patient call cops would huge trouble. wow. love Wow failure. let 600k+ die overwhelm hospitals year ensure economic growth. I'm certain true state reside. heard true across country based reports I've seen. 9/7 close, sure thinking someone else birthday 8/7? crazy thing? even far overall average growth rate Tennessee -- increased 826% since July 12. 

(That calculation 7 day case averages one article 14 day averages, entirely apples apples, nevertheless, pretty good sign things great overall, either) Ventilators help smallpox, doctors even entirely sure exactly kills. treatment supportative care immune system job, maybe would 25%, even 20%, instead 30% dramatic decrease mortality would allow comparing COVID (remember, existed mid 20th century lethal before) Nah they’re selling federal government municipalities. Government contracts, bought bulk Holy crap! I’m glad you’re better now.  Damn man. sounds really rough. go making positive life changes family. Unfortunately article provide demographic breakdowns raw numbers. Stats like indicative vaccine failure result vaccination rates higher older, vulnerable people generate much immune response vaccination first place. boosters recommended populations.  true example, even though reported number deaths 2017-2018 flu season 188, CDC estimates actual number closer 600.

And that's single year (with flu vaccines) vs 1 1/2 year covid (with vaccines kids).

Obviously possible covid deaths kids undercounted too, imagine testing covid much commonplace testing flu. not. already there, go take look comments /r/medicine get feel level frustration burnout. employees contractors required wear mask **inside** NPS buildings even **crowded outdoor spots** run-on sentence form: retirement finance option 401k account pension plan, either established partnered employer, set automatic contribution paycheck, employer may match money, particular percentage total paycheck, deposit together.

They use perk. money now, little money goes away later. technically ""free"" extra money people afford held aside 50 years, I'm sure hope die then.

Note percentages from/calculated gross pay pay period. employer matching percentage contribution, matching percentage pay. get $100.00 paycheck, contribute 10% 5% match, total contribution $15.00, $10.50. money matched coming them, hate matching large amounts... case live long enough cash out.

So: pre-pandemic employer 3% 401k matching. opted shift 1% pay 401k, would copy dollar amount money put 401k. contributed 5% pay, would calculate maximum 3% pay, put 401k (my 5% 3%).

My spouse's actually forces contribution pension plan works similarly. pension involuntary 10% contribution; automatically take 10% pay set aside, match 14% total pay. nothing additional means [effectively] look gross pay 20% number pension balance. wanted bump contribution additional forced 10, say total 15% they'd match 14%. We're around 6-8 month time period many dam fully vaccinated people catching breakthrough infections Delta, way see people waiting 9 months clear could use booster that.   wait months place line (know people lied said bar tenders such). 50% sucking quickly could get theirs. number daily new cases US seems stagnating last days. consider peak? Release boosters!! got vaccine early April. time got vaccine vaccination site huge set like clinic disaster movie. Probably 50-100 people getting vaccine moment getting mine hundreds waiting. 

My daughter got vaccine approved 12 within 48 hours approval FDA May. went back location vaccine. know there? Nobody. literally walked right counter, wait, got vaccine giant room dozens dozens techs administering vaccine single pharmacist lobby building. leaving saw one family bringing child. 

At point region around 55% vaccine adoption rate eligible patients 16 up. 

That's got sinking feeling. half state still needed vaccinated big vaccination sites already shut lack interest... fucked. are.  almost like Moderna/Pfizer huge marketing pushes media... know couple doctors already took 3rd shot (little different situation). doctor take advice, however, ask one. haven’t looked closely I’ve least seen headlines results numerous trials mixing matching. also seems like would major priority FDA figure out. Crazy wouldn’t recommend it. I'm Alabama past 30 mins two ambulances zoomed window work. Guess now. Hard say. look like things peaking southern states. However, school opening we'll see COVID human behavior that's main driver spread. 

It's question whether case surges move parts US now. seem Midwest Oregon. Well, duhh 12 can’t come fast enough. kids start school two weeks masks optional. I’m fucking beside anxiety. bemoan stories cases deaths doesn’t way. 

You interesting point though. 

Perhaps someone wrote stories deaths day, even running list, better information person death affected around them; maybe it’d strike home people way current emphasis huge increasing case numbers running death averages not. 

It would almost impossible nationwide, could see effective local level. 

Problem usually get death stories background people public antivaxxers mostly schadenfreude.  mouth gods ears. work daycare. sick af. never sick shot, even likely covid school Feb 2020. Exactly, so.many.dam.fully.vaccinated.people.are.catching.Delta. 

Of course keeping hospital/dying, night day difference alpha covid even catching covid pre-Delta extremely rare. We're around 6-8 month time period many people getting breakthrough infections I'd say screw get booster sooner rather later.

My response “Yeah, if….” live NYC far understand, must present proof vaccination. CDC issued vaccine card, NYS Excelsior pass (digital vaccine card), NYC vaccine pass, pic card work. shall see works. schools, literally school required get vaccinated switch elementary schools younger. lot people going switching jobs soon then. Let's see many good employees force back work companies year. front page New York Times numbers year now. Large swaths people cannot even convinced get flu shot. Given struggle get critical mass people get vaccinated all, massive struggle get people get boosters, goal moving towards ""green pass"" type society, vaccinated status gatekeeper participating social / work / leisure / travel activities... seems pie sky nation like US. idea going movie theater relaxing know everyone inside checked vaccination status seems within reach -- realize, also check date vaccinations. I'm vaccinated, I'm going run 26 miles. Thanks asking though. Thanks this. Would good see demographic breakdown. it’s cold /s

I’m really sorry go that. sounds absolutely terrifying I’m sure scratches surface go through. Jay Cutler whiny QB one them.  felt better countries worse problems get vaccine first waited. ramping now. According CDC recommending boosters people fall categories:

* receiving active cancer treatment tumors cancers blood
* Received organ transplant taking medicine suppress immune system
* Received stem cell transplant within last 2 years taking medicine suppress immune system
* Moderate severe primary immunodeficiency (such DiGeorge syndrome, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome)
* Advanced untreated HIV infection
* Active treatment high-dose corticosteroids drugs may suppress immune response sat plane virus researcher said Moderna ""best"" vaccine larger ""dose"" somehow. pretend know whether dose right word thank response. convince people positive still get vax? both. 2 year old want prevent long issue caught this. extremely sheltered her, trying keep safe. I'm 35, overly worried long covid issues like daughter wife. vaccinated, never stopped wearing mask following strictest CDC guidelines. knew types variants possible. Currently 16s eligible. 80% 16s. second shot Friday. fine waiting 8 months. lol

[Collect whole great sign Texans general. Considering Covid taking emergency rooms, feel people life happen unvaccinated bodies take space could likely prevented death long term damage regular injuries.  least dolly cool everyone likes her. makes sense. means trust vaccines. Germany it’s possible put kind restriction fully vaccinated people. goes constitution. understaffed hospitals? people quitting burnout? collect unemployment &amp; covid benefits? Automod allow mean words sub rephrasing:

Definitely ugly space folk Stargate universe. beginning suspect Goa'uld care health people. hope get correct treatment soon possible. I'm sorry dicked around. let dogs out! New York packed. Considering Florida Texas essentially live air-conditioned house car, picking food drive ins, much less human contact, impressive spike bad. need strike balance. Vaccines, masks, nonsense lockdowns curfews Impossible clearr....we needed test get Canada, get home.  course people dumb enough trust sports journalist doctors. ???

I understand mechanism action understand can't physically long term flaw.

Tell me, know using smart phone long term adverse effects?

They've around 12 years, vaccine.

Oh, understand smart phones work, can't physically adverse long term side effect you.

Let guess, know mRNA vaccines around since SARS-CoV-1??

Also, find particularly says believe modern medicine?

What think modern medicine is? Iron Lung? new vaccines literally definition modern medicine.  Yes, even fully vaccinated. Florida districts might get money Feds state cuts funding. I’m sure go towards improving internet remote learning students. That's interesting news. Planning ski trip Canada. Maybe I'll drive across border then. field all, viral vector mRNA vaccines deliver spike protein instructions cells. cells make spike protein train off. end result would same. see mRNA booster work viral vector original shot. That's dangerous viewpoint backed facts. 

 

I love thread story hospitals short staffed, nobody talking all.  number 1 number 2? Suck it, reddit. Thanks, numbers disconcerting. parents protesting, mask mandates.. link?

I tried ordering Amazon *obviously* fake. Material felt completely wrong put could smell it. Los Angeles, addition every kid gets tested COVID every week. antibodies made still recognize delta variants. issue amount antibodies low compared amount virus people exposed to. Delta extra infectious evades immune response, infected produce massive amount virus overwhelm immune response. Boosters increase antibody production, needed. Leaves confusion whether doctor would consider seeing patients recommended take vaccine though. think saying definitely true people, others, like inlaws, really cannot underestimate much things like authority giving stamp approval mean them. live state governor actively suing penalizing schools try require masks, yet, still deeply reliant upon governmental guidance determine think issues. explained major countries standout leaders using science logistical know-how handle covid giving boosters people demographic, CDC made call yet, refusing get booster. (My in-laws older existing health conditions). know soon Biden gives word, first line get -- despite 4 years Trump, despite initial CDC advice masks necessary, despite clearly US lags behind countries covid response, appeal-to-authority strong people, especially older generations. chance moderna take booster shot give unvaccinated person africa india? turns we're fine happy poor barren monster  Yea, completely agree mandate.

Mandate pcr test flying would good system. wrong need conversations vaccines visits. pro-vax was/am vaccine hesitant youngest child allergic one 5 shots got time know one. 3 peds agreed signed exemption papers school. one pediatrician asked would like referral allergist deals vaccine allergies treating them. much want that, even know specialty existed. Now, getting shots huge production people standing ready step first sign trouble, *can* get shots.  Tbf sounds like worked pre global pandemic... Frankly federal even state means build cheapskate hospital 30 days like China. Id argue itd fine. Alabamas parking garage idea isnt terrible, sanitary holds idiots refusing vaccine... Im ok that.

Actually term preparedness next pandemic id argue gigantic concrete behemoths considered asset handle overflow. Doesnt help staffing though stake situation vaccinated American, Based lot upvoted commentary various subs, “pandemic darling” status slowly surely beginning turn. properly fitted n95

If find one fit seven year old, please let know. youngest last unvaccinated member family mindblowingly frustrating trying keep safe, particularly school open. think it’s higher that. We’re already booking hotels flights… Everyone agreed don’t want miss another season hockey since we’re vaccinated, sit out? going forever waiting covid end? Can’t live life like forever. Well would love auto mod keeps deleting comments links NCBI research articles topic claiming ""news site"" may ""political"". short, comes doctors either knowing anything prep, wanting learn, homophobic ideas as: giving patient prep make want sleep around, want that! 

Similar thoughts birth control. Seems like failure hospitals. I'm sure mixture burnout, free covid money government. 

  
 bit unnerving see media outlets running stories hospitals overflowing covid patients. state journalism country horrendous. 

Hospital staffing clearly main issue play here, states issue. seems misleading places lead staffing issues. know longer outcome this? another booster shot every 8 months until… forever? Trying understand reoccurring thing twice year rest lives pandemic “ends”? Lol, also downvoted oblivion yesterday posted figure Israel. downvote brigade something?  They’re going deprive even Americans culture.  bought KF94 Amazon fit 6 year old perfectly. They’re probably becoming harder find definitely there. sorry loss. fun seeing everybody run around like 2019?  mean he’d much higher chance ventilator without it? agree.   I'm pretty sure every hospital every state hiring nurses moment... yeah, one state, hospital system that's problem. 

Not burn out, illness, fact anti-vax fucking idiots turned short term problem long term one end sight stupidity.

in short fucking idiot  Ah ok want tell India vaccinated delta mutated I? Reformulated delta boosters still clinical trials. Weird allow show negative test. Heck, they'll trust 15-year-old Facebook doctor. slaughter though it. whole past 18 months risk assessment risk assessment weighing risks. truth exposing unvaccinated kids slightly covid big deal, definitely worth keeping whole nation economy locked for.  irresponsible. proven exactly why. vaccine means probably minor case, odds death close zero. Unfortunately breakthrough infections thing vaccines, according Israel UK, they’re fairly common delta.

This CDC recommends vaccinated people wear masks indoors. vaccine combination N95 (or equivalent) provides robust protection infection delta. People still use physical calendars flip? bizarre. That's one smart mama What? TDAP every 10 years. Healty adults generally need Hep Polio boosters shots kid. Hahahaha! Exactly US needs nationwide consistent vaccine credential.  Funny got turned marketing opportunity.  He's gonna fine though, vaccinated quick intervention. Opinion polls suggest otherwise

In June, [94% Brazilians eager get Europe, Spain lowest number people unwilling get vaccinated, [at around Common you’re governor suppose spent total 10 years graduate school - including residency fellowship. can't imagine squandering away trying make &lt;$1500 (not including ebay fees) something asinine. amount probably less 1 month school loan payment. waste. take mask 1st, 2nd, 3rd shot? not, what’s point? get at-home rapid test amazon cvs/walgreens. got mine next day delivery amazon. tested positive rapid test sore throat symptom (positive pcr next day well). reliable rapid tests although room user error. read directions first fine go route. Yeah, consequence living area high transmission rates. gonna guess? gonna throw HUGE maskless get-together last night. many people also vaccinated? many infected end extremely ill  suspect really need data one.  another poster mentioned, tropical storm avoided populated areas testing sites would’ve closed day most. Tropical storms really non-event Florida. That's honest, we? qualifications, many people talking about? sounds like select afford it. mind sounding like picky ass means explain future. suspect governor one conditions (high BMI perhaps)? doesn’t feel like hospitals swamped moment, everyone good chance qualifying compared important political figures. Simple primary care hospital network gone day appointments waiting 3 weeks get boil lanced. I’m guessing I’m standing much chance asking specific antibody test ordered.   go get Pfizer moderna shot getting j&amp;j? wife got j&amp;j never hear positive things shots. Region E (Dallas/Fort Worth), currently 78 ICU beds available - number deceptive. 96% ICU beds currently occupied. Region E encompasses 8 million people several large cities - think many hospitals Dallas, Fort Worth, Arlington, Plano, Garland, Irving, McKinney, Sherman, Denison, Richardson, Lewisville, Denton, Bedford, Carrollton, Grand Prairie, Frisco, Mesquite, Allen, Flower Mound, Euless, Grapevine -- huge area dozens hospitals, spread 78 open beds them, imagine several zero beds available. 
 
Region E Hospital Usage:   would state want inflate numbers that?  Mask people follow common sense advice. Get vaccinated well. certainly plans go Disney. live Midwest I'm currently even taking kids grocery store... Fully vaccinated, receives best care money buy, go back couple weeks saying ""just flu""  gonna say authoritatively probably isn’t big one still wouldn’t worry. find stressing out, alternative ways attend class? Like online option pre recorded lectures? make sure whatever feel comfortable with. would much like know answer this. 21 hours ago. mask sight group one least receptive vaccines   completely utterly ridiculous. think COVID respects minimum age?  Delta contagious. could become bad news, fast Oh things news didnt bring up. Idk appears ""capacity"" like ""overflow capacity"" often ""available"" not. think could consider overflow part regular option capacity ICU id wonder often flu ""normally"" pushes passed that. Like obviously one h1n1 bad year often end practically sharing beds roomed hospital hallways? ever point needed consider putting parking garage? + Flu actually known seasonal plus ready made accessible vaccines.

Like im programmer amazon web services often lets services handle random bursts extra cost. worth customer service hassle... become problem goes beyond burst ie... Two months unfettered community spread. instance(computer layperson) starts fail goes out. Hospitals seemed able handle bursts sustained burn growth? deal.

Disclaimer: please dont take argument wretched for-profit healthcare system. Ive love it... disgust disappointment. dont see ICUs werent poorly managed considering pre-covid norms. least newsworthy prior. Uhh… would argue great. fact situation deteriorated enough mandate extended actually terrible news. It’s better early 2020. vaccines go long way

I'd argue opposite. reason.. vaccines state 30-40% received refuse get vaccinated. way worse.. early 2020 choice.. choice now.. people refuse. I'm 29 never even knew *could* get it. mean think ever thought *wouldn't* allowed to, never occurred me. fear needles think I'd ever issue getting jabbed help cut community transmission bit. He's also supposedly fully vaccinated. likely remain asymptomatic. said comment, believe Everywhere, soon, assume. already reneging relaxing masks Oh, complicated. partially vaccinated. Got positive tests receiving second dose 2 weeks up. don’t specify. Possible got infected got second shot week later. knows. Sucks single dose didn’t keep hospital.  parents healthy one chemo past. 60s sure risk. don’t seem concerned all. need one these, age 65, bmi 26, diabetes, htn, cancer...I full list infront encompass lot people. wife got upper respiratory infection cruise Hawaii... got free ibuprofen ship's doctor Beasley went full fuckin crazy. sucks too

i loved cowboys fan. 
but immediately talked shit cowboys going bills Oh know goes beyond me. need time prepare side effects. Second dose almost ER ""following science"" not? already know outdoor transmission negligible.  Nope. Covid seasonal flu immune system take care it. god stuff. /s  depend tourism lol. locked down, people would starve. still managed snag enough vaccines. could get one months now. condition ED, pretty underweight immune system bit weakened. sure big risk factor underweight is. Still 80%+ chance catch covid even Delta variant. Even extraordinarily unlikely I'd end sick, dead hospital. Mid September far fewer crowds since kids back school. changing plans.

At point live life normally again.  Plenty done slow spread without vaccines. Worldometer says 1.2 million confirmed cases 10% positivity rate tests Georgia rate 121k per million population. Washington 68k per million cases, 561k total 3% positivity rate. Washington 33% less dense got virus first colder.  state one time covered medicine, administration. pretty expensive yes. Probably hundred dollars. know grants still place medicine. He’s probably going point mild infection “proof” COVID overblown make hospitals illegal something. bet good insurance low copay Governor all.  comes tolerant, caring, open-minded redditors wish death upon someone disagree with.  Im suggesting transmissibility vaccinated individuals far low support exponential, country dominating spread we've seen past months.

The vast majority cases found within unvaccinated communities reason Walk in. drug store. 10min. Actually, second game. Opener U. Hawaii.  problem lucrative, need antibodies tested window. comorbid condition, age 65, diabetes, htn, bmi 26, cancer, others.  heard what's happening many hospitals, possibility outbreaks causing resistive variant? Bear mind people go hospitals reasons Covid. Lol, that’s stupid people eBay selling hard drives loaded torrented copyrighted movies Believe me, get it.

I’m sure downvoted - got already announced didn’t really steal anyone’s spot, probably took dose gonna thrown ""Over april""

""But t-cells""

""Immunity lasts years""

Yall clue youre talking 😂😂😂😂

We actually need boosters now. Antibody titers key cells supposed ""on-demand"" reserves kick normal decline neutralizing antibody (nAb) levels, providing protracted protection. several new reports point nAbs antibody titers decline antibody titers key, igG half life 27 days, standard coronavirus reinfection period 90 days, using half life equation, find vaccine lifetime 157 days 2nd dose.

Find antibody critical = × (0.5) ^ ( / = 100 × (0.5) ^ (90 / = 10 (10% antibodies provided natural infection)

Find vaccine lifetime, given 4x antibodies induced = 400 × (0.5) ^ (t / / 400) = (0.5) ^ (t / / 400) = (t / 27) × = 143 days (after 2nd dose) + 14 days = 157 days

Meanwhile, basically shelter place recommendation UCSF Dept Medicine Chair, Bob double masking (cloth/surgical). indoor dining, &amp; sadly poker w/ vaxxed pals. I’ll peel protections cases fall, particularly make choices, don’t underestimate Delta. CDC said, it’s new Can't boost vaccine adenovirus vector, right? Although they've already showed UK study boosting AZ mRNA works well, likely would get Moderna Pfizer booster Check Realtor.com varies. 1 4 homes sold people moving state buying Airbnb.

I'm transplant Boston area. I'm 3 hr drive Boston take train. Yea I’m gonna go ahead get booster week - fully vaccinated January 15th I’m area high covid rates. sad, reason sooo sad live relatively cruel world. society leaned toward utopia dystopia, tragedies lead hardships. world, generally do. 

Point is, gut-wrenching feeling hear story due covid, rather reality much harder person's life going without parents there; that's commentary society.  Uhmm want it??
The vaccine temporary side effects. rare long term serious side effects. Also vaccine doesnt work well advertised. (If did, masks back again) Also colds vary dramatically severity. bad cold feel lot like flu, chattering teeth shaking, etc. flu different league  There’s big difference literally banning masks forcing people non FDA approved vaccine enter private businesses. 

Like night day. 

I’m pro vacation vaxed. much like 9/11 loss privacy - watching people give freedoms fear. boost delta already happening. thought advantage mrna vaccines problem New Orleans, sad see. numbers city pretty good low certain demographics   vax work back January. 😬 helping generalizing. far every gay person PrEP. thank Federal Reserve Wall St. Money power control.

Vaccine equity going big factor defeating pandemic. purpose booster increase antibodies, antibodies protect alpha, right? What's like Delta?

I don’t even want know next 5 years look like willingly give away freedoms. Welcome news! healthcare provider, got second dose early January beginning worry waning immunity right Delta ramping up. Hopefully actually gets approved soon. Fuck

I say we're sane :( schools CDC FDA recommended immunocompromised mRNA recipients get 3rd dose. far don’t recommend J&amp;J recipients. mean J&amp;J better, least longer lasting, booster either needed, needed much later? I'm - need paid leave vaccination &amp; side effects Yeah, I’m fully expecting count day two. I’ma try get morning shot sleep fever 12 hours later. Absolutely yes  chance experience young colleagues shot. old boomers get absolutely horrendous second shot experience Pfizer. generally tell people know second dose already. Even bad last time, would rather get booster get covid. that's body reacted vaccine, shudder think would handle covid. oh wow, thought still lol. hope album comes soon. graduated last year, still signed updates. 

Texas, everything recommend. School enough money buy 50 top line iMacs anything sports wise. money goes stem reasoning.

Nice expand nationwide coverage, dumb-dumbs south need protected themselves. mom won’t get vaccine, know mentality would like. It’s every person thinks get covid they’ll one 99% end surviving it. None thinks they’ll one ones dies even ends hospital.

Or think numbers made up. lot going around. It’s easy dismiss hundreds deaths truly believe deaths something else labeled covid deaths.  mean fair last winter/spring crap shoot places. remember staying late refreshing sites, calling around random places, getting knows many lists.

The FFCRA, mandated employers fewer 500 employees provide paid sick leave suffering COVID, expired last December voluntary extension ends September. point, we're basically back pandemic anyone physically bedridden COVID make choices everytime got sick something else before. Maybe I've worked unfortunate jobs relatively shit benefits (especially comes time off) there's always people something obviously wrong physically showing work (be can't afford miss time want show company much reliable worker are).

Based I've read, mean 8 months second dose. COVID thought cause blood clots immune cascade also ramps blood's willingness clot. AZ vaccine thought cause blood clots (very rarely) producing antibodies bind directly platelets. wearing mask reduces risk doesn’t change fact exposed. That’s I’m saying. Masking important vaccinated even send kids school, masks spins come positive case guidance quarantine. No, technically start 20th, small businesses already enforcing this. aside bar owner association rules reserved bars - restaurant indoor activities businesses - started like week two back enforcing this. think City used experiment jump start enforcement City-wide, especially successful far. Ever Ever therapist told need start using word frustrating even it’s frustrating it’s still really fucking sad ridiculous May ask cannot? enter business? Ive requested vaccines 3 4 times life, basically enrolling new school. required show proof social events? Thats whole point comment, way head. state in? never heard it.

/s would fucking awesome Better. Trending wrong way, considering we’ve ton hospitalizations it’s weeks now, think it’s good far deaths go. 

Thank frontline medical worker life get rest. Definitely. don’t really remember Swine Flu Pandemic 2009 half country vaccine losing minds? everyone ok vaccine wasn’t “ExPeRiMeNtAL”? looks like wasn’t nearly deadly Covid. people shouting 99% survival rate too? dog favorite hobby. become invulnerable fire DOTs NYC maskless month hospitals fine. got whacked April 2020 probably ripped city's population. argument lead April 2020 [the data show we've likely already peaked actually heal others touch need car curbside pickup I’m sorry, I’m confused. Didn’t state earlier 93% 15+ Iceland vaccinated, represent 80% cases? 7% unvaccinated represent 20% cases? argument favor vaccinations efficacy? Bar-B-Q. one wanting accept reality babies toddlers probably likely spread disease parents caregivers cared directly, close contact.

Everyone goes straight babies toddlers gross, probably mostly fact sick, parents can't tell go sleep room. major supply chain issues comes sending mRNA vaccines en masse. need build production facilities countries, try ship incredibly fragile vaccines outrageous expense difficulty.  players college educated???? need education reform bad. 1 team managed far.... point vaccinations mean little regards spreading Covid. I've long day. saying worse better they're saying?  Nope. That’s case according state. good ole Alpha around here…for now. villages high vaccination rate, they’re mostly elderly. hope booster isn’t mandated order considered fully vaccinated. fact substantial portion vaccinated population need booster anytime soon. Education level highly correlated vaccine approval New Hampshire, kind confused. CDC region delta since says rushed  Ooooooh okay makes sense anti vax idiots shut testing site earlier today. pregnant people pregnant women? getting bit ridiculous now... 1-0 far season. Give trophy. wife can't get vaccine, can't go eat every again? Anywhere 1 999,999,999 Reverse Uno! isnt chance getting covid without shot like 100% ? never said business can't deny access. However long showing private parts, nothing cops it. wonderful can't wait come city don’t understand anti mask antivaxxers important appreciated comment. It’s clearly sarcastic, right?! Yikes

Though seem bit attendance. remembering right?

This still unlikely soft landing.

The reports hear say masking occurring varied industries building however outside - much all. earned break! Enjoy vacation!  natural infection boot? set long haul!  bruh u didnt get joke english like im 5 years old buy GameStop doge. one refusing food can't prove vaccinated. takeout refuse vaccination. literally choice. beginning masks prevalent now.

Basically put something mouth, message. This, thanks.

I literally lying next door little cube. waiting hallway space couple hours. spot going give me, rushed family side.

I abdominal pain, much shit going intense. stayed gurney lying tried stay way. locked eyes wheeled hallway imaging.

He back 15 20 minutes. Everything going okay suddenly alarm went off, everybody floor rushed cube area. worked seemed like forever trying revive him. one lost cool. could hear clearly memory saying night weird around midnight already.

I've never close death actually happening before. Right died power outage too. crazy night. cemented serious fear ever returning emergency room hospital ever again. Yes, that's point entirely. never metric success, data point strive for, since lockdowns started. year 2 ""state emergency"" hospitals even close April 2020. Little bits stoicism helped me. Like letting go things can't control (basically every major disaster looming horizon) focusing things can. Look it, helped put things perspective ease anxiety. mean “overdose?” Maybe learn spell. People really distinguishing testing positive COVID falling severely ill here. I've also never seen description constitutes ""severe"" vs. ""mild"", symptoms certainly bad enough put hospital, call mild cold; pretty severe standards (I bed week hottest week summer - spirits improved, I'm still recovering lot congestion). know vaccination prevent getting infected, necessarily, *supposed* prevent symptomatic disease, that, least *severe* symptoms. Overwhelmingly likely fail. wouldn’t believe many medicines fail phase 3 Ok gotcha. Still bad insanely bad like thought. Thanks clarification. Putting freezing cream beforehand (available counter) helpful lot patients, vaccine injections painful, others said, cream good mental state alleviate sensation. one refusing slice pizza. takeout refuse vaccination. literally choice.  concern giving rights likely never get back.

You're concerned vaccine requirements threat rights, we've required vaccinate decades. hyperbole highlights asinine concern is.  bolsonaro ignored 80 e-mails Pfizer, Brazil would likely vaccinated entire population two doses already.

This power Zé Gotinha usually try distract patients I'm getting ready poke them. try distract you, fight it. They're trying make easier  need something, vials doses set expire, fact, think already approve using J&amp;J vaccine post-date. 

Either use boosters give world, don’t let go waste. point is.....?  Yes! add consequences (for doctors nurses) spreading misinformation masks too, vaccines. That's Pentavaxed you. :) post removed cannot verify reliable source. Twitter sources may reliable. possible, please re-submit link reliable source (i.e. news article).

NYC high vaccination rate, hopefully hurt much. others pointed out, past either quarantines letting disease thing runs people infect, people relatively immobile isolated compared now. Keep mind centuries cities tended walls could close world keep disease (or in) things got bad enough.

Nowadays even ""lockdowns"" actually anything stopping people hopping car going somewhere 500 miles away bringing disease them. covid restrictions many people ""first world"" countries could trivially get passport plane ticket almost anywhere world better reason sightseeing, potentially bring disease them. Even political existed true quarantine, enough police soldiers combined cities actually keep population going wanted to, even enforce testing every person quarantine positive tests. Hopefully could motivate southerners get vaccinated DeSantis' Shock Doctrine developing planned. hope appropriate place don’t know calm anger anti-mask/anti-vax crowd. hospitals overflowing you’re freaking someone else wanting wear piece fabric get shot. New Orleans liberal like almost urban area is, it’s fundamentally even culturally southern.

Kinda like Miami geographically literally southern big city US has, it’s “southern”. extreme, don’t get wrong, it’s similar kind dimension.

Ways New Orleans “southern”:

1) Unsweetened tea consumed much heavily sweet tea

2) Catholics galore (check out, KKK used really really hate Catholics)

3) Long history acceptance homosexuality far predates broader south even cities

4) culture alcohol excess, Puritanism.

5) Distinct food cultures Cajuns creoles much separate southern food, although plenty crossover thanks shared African influences

6) Significant historical urbanization nowhere else south ever really had. New Orleans one point third largest city Us largest city south 1830 1950. Historical urbanization south otherwise fairly mutually exclusive scale.

7) Historic immigrant populations unlike anywhere else south, including Irish, Italian, Jewish, etc. can’t find groups south, urban communities 1800s immigrants rare south.

8) New Orleans voted succession.

And really, let’s get main point: Born raised New Orleans, I’ll damned anyone calls southerner. don’t identify one, feels totally wrong. far I’m aware common sentiment here. FALSE! 

They even focusing Lambda deemed variant interest. 

\- Dwight Schrute know limits...here's 6 seconds ""not great, terrible"" scene   meme'd bit scratch list!    serious problem. countries still low enough disease burden effective contact tracing found outbreaks apartment buildings shared ventilation (if recall correctly, reports Singapore Hong Kong vector). Australia, couple outbreaks travel quarantine facilities used hotels shared ventilation.

So, possible everything right vaccinating masking errands avoiding crowded venues, still get building redistributes air units. Retrofitting sterilizing UV-C lights HVAC systems growth business, anticipate remain one years come.  girlfriends boss intentionally infecting employees.

My girlfriend works retail job manager hardcore covid denier. ER 2 days covid-like symptoms, returned work without telling anybody happened. Almost immediately break store 5 employees (including girlfriend) tested positive. manager claims flu refuses get tested. girlfriend got sick denied PTO two weeks quarantine can't prove got work. manager outspoken covid denier anti masker, frequently complaining nothing pulling mask speak employees customers often leaving entire shift.

Is someone call force get tested? call police? gf scared retaliation manager reported superiors HR multiple times this, company done nothing. Sadly, you’re probably right. agree vaccinating world slow variants. lot ways virus could mutate set us back square one (or worse — much, much worse). 

But mRNA vaccines intense refrigeration requirements make tough distribute overseas. need ramping production there. don’t think US boosters really going make much difference. mRNA COVID-19 vaccines effective prevent infections""

I'm exactly sure person talking data fairly strong vaccines reduce risk infection that's literally purpose “after reviewing available evidence including risks myocarditis, ACIP determined benefits using mRNA COVID-19 vaccines FDA’s EUA clearly outweigh risks populations, including adolescents young adults.” Straight Lmfao, aint killing fat people alright bro.

I, internet stranger, thank service give blessings seek booster. say? Pharmacies less likely deeper checking asking insurance info. say insurance get free question asked. NFL planning controversial rule game ends tie, instead overtime, team vaccinated players automatically wins. neighbor ER physician said treatments improved lot since last year. frightening indeed. support masks indoors, banishing indoor activities vaxed way far.

I can't remember said it, something like: people robbed liberties, give freely, demand ti taken even. that's see here.

And I'm pro vax, even pro obligatory vaccination looses status emergency vaccine  Dude, fact living head rent free 16 days pretty damn bizarre. Yikes... CDC ACIP says get 3rd dose vaccine had. Weird, since USA, 50 percent 25-39 year olds, 45 percent 18-24 year olds vaccinated COVID-19 (as today). suppose vaccinated youngest people passionate vaccinated compared oldest vaccinated people.

I'm fully vaccinated Millennial cutting ties vaccine though. mainstream media blast people - ""NOBODY WANTS WORK!!!!""   extremely difficult say sure exactly happened one individual case. main takeaway broader data vaccinated people less likely get disease, less likely get severely sick die disease, less likely spread disease disease. 

The people vaccinated less disease spread direct relationship. 

At individual company, anything could happen vaccinated people could get sick unvaccinated people could remain extremely healthy. statistics medicine broader trends one case. Boom...in face, non southern teams think control herd? Nah, way. See brother. May assholes loose like goose. Amen Sex minors. third dose base vaccine, right?

""Essential workers"" actually means ""essential work"". workers replaceable. Saaame. stayed home cold Wednesday. Thursday evening 101 fever. Given know vaccinated people able spread Delta, third shot returns immunity pre-delta levels (where evidence pointed vaccinated ppl spreading Covid rare), it’s good thing collective immunity regardless. Probably won’t help hospital system much true new vaccine recipient, still helps reducing spread. Someone please put mind ease ADE. 

I horrible fear eventually variant found cause ADE, suddenly everyone previously covid vaccinated see chances dying skyrocket 10 90x unvaccinated alpha was.

I put fear mind months vaccines kicking butt, surging delta cases worried again. We're really struggling keep virus control (I know probably never gone good) means mutations, mutations, mutations.  mean- many areas request use trucks. Strange thing say… Appreciate honesty. 😂😂. Wait. original person responded taking Australia comment got deleted deleted it. claiming needed vaccination card ride buses go grocery stores Australia (which correct).

You taking New York. That's find anything. searching wrong location.

Anyway... still allowed shop grocery store section. able sit eat inside go 'dining' section.  Major vague thing.

Just guess, district quarantining 500 students first three days school year. opinion POC unable decide what’s good bad

yes Makes sense. Young children age put mouth everything, always drueling slobbering stuff. Us parents likely kiss snuggle age well, symptoms children young confused many viruses child may pick daycare. really cool story, bro.

Every single covid pt hospital unvaccinated. Every single one. understanding reading subreddit POC aren’t getting vaccine due lack access

Your understanding completely wrong. POC myself, live predominantly POC neighborhood, spend time POC-heavy areas. walk two steps bazillion pharmacies get shot, NYC gov vaccine trucks parked major streets provide anyone age minimum, heavily blanket neighborhoods low vaccination rates order encourage make vaccination easier. vaccine extremely accessible POC not. point, unvaccinated result choice, accessibility.

We're whole new world federal control ""for good"" preaching. Thank you. find part interesting Court held mandatory vaccinations neither arbitrary oppressive long ""go far beyond reasonably required safety public"".

Risk death contracting smallpox estimated \~30% compared \~2% among infected COVID-19. Given disparity mortality rates well latest stats re: waning antibodies transmissibility, vaccine mandates truly required keeping people safe? masks social distancing deemed ineffective measures? push byproduct non-compliance among stubborn/misinformed? something else I'm aware of? trust vaccines always always will,

The thing true EU members. compeltely insane get preposterous claim 99% adults Brazilian city 12 million people vaccinated covid.

You believe city 1.2 MILLION people live slums voted Bolsonaro 3 years ago achieved higher vaccination rate Helsinki, Copenhagen, Zurich Vienna have. That's nuts, man! also relying Sinopharm Russian vaccines population. Thanks! Ok, claim impossible, get data Brazil? 
You multiple brazilians thread telling antivax isnt thing, yet insist belief somehow credible actual data.
Why? 
Critical thinking essential, specially times like one we're living, believing something insisting ""it cant so"" isnt knowledge, critical thinking. 
You unwilling accept facts dont like also unwilling look data it. pregnant friend (trial participant) go get third shot- playing around. I'm also trial mulling dropping third shot, different vaccines. Vaccinated Jan/February go trenches TX university. 


I want stay on, keep giving data, I'm concerned inadvertently precluding variant-specific booster might needed, I'm mulling it.   FBI wants big fish, care small one.   one Epsilon, one Lambda, worry guys - feds paying CRAZY money one these! city limits proper? wider metro area, actually people referring say “Atlanta,” much bigger city limits.

If nothing else, it’s interesting AJC reporting total cases, total enrollment, mask policies district. could prove valuable data final analysis see masks really help Delta variant. course, final analysis won’t come soon enough make difference, work say “I told so!” course is, stating still spread disease really tell whole story. broad measure covers current pandemic? I’m don’t doubt government overreach specifically fits it’s hard otherwise gain consensus Sadly Patriots going go big run end 160% vaccinated. Falcons end somehow squandering impossible margin overcome. Nah scared vaccine stay home. making quotes now? mentioned fat people?

Volunteering hospital indeed great service applaud time e so, wouldn’t able prevent hospital visits first place talking common sense selfish people filling hospitals? ounce prevention that..? do. Make absolutely miserable unvaccinated.

Mandating masks? vaccinated people follow guidance. useless didn’t arrive spread moment time. Comparing rate increase time period two locations isn’t relevant. Also you’re talking rate increase, numbers people getting sick proportion vaccinated unvaccinated population.  Hawaii underserved hospitals, majority cases unvaccinated people. 

nearly every headline take ""hospitalizations soar ---------- mention 96-98 100 admits unvaccinated."" See problem here? Trojan Officer  Lovely. travel restrictions *and* Vaccine Police. 

Those crazy conspiracy theorists, wacky. Nothing like ever happen... one video got attention last week, moron named Dr. Stock, think. ranting like lunatic school board meeting Indiana. know uncle (we don’t talk anymore) blaming grandma’s newly diagnosed cancer vaccine, sent parents (all healthcare workers) video proof he’s right, we’re horrible people supposedly giving grandma cancer.  ""You can't explain tides."" - Bill O'Reilly 2011 early Israeli study seems show third dose regular Pfizer vaccine enough effectively neutralize delta. Pangolins need lockdown fortunately unders 12s get vaccinated pushback agaisnt mandates restrictions. everyone chance get vaccinated, people won’t care unvaccinated people get sick die choices. lot ""nurses"" actually nursing assistants unit secretaries etc. actual licensed nurses promoting foolishness, worst offenders CNA's ancillary staff medical facilities.

Nurses actual licenses protect. ancillary staff don't, makes harder stamp out.  submission automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Anyone else concerned Fake Vax cards?

Fake COVID-19 vaccination cards worry college  First shot: near zero pain.
Second shot: pain all

Generally, I’ve always found looking away focusing breathing effective things like getting blood samples. Vaccine shots, contrast, usually quick done. actually ask second Moderna shot done didn’t feel all. specified food, alcohol.  work district. kids sick can’t get test too. double 11, dude. don’t double stupid. Whos fault isnt living wage support yourself? ask server employed server? get shit service pay tip time gas effort top free meal? know pediatric ICU state full children Covid case early on. trust health professionals news stating children sitting ducks Governor bans mask mandates, might know observing. assume studies follow.

People catching smallpox least 3,000 years. found Egyptian mummies ancient texts describing disease. wiped earth vaccines. 

And yes, smallpox airborne respiratory disease. social security number never meant form ID, yet are. 
Also, absolutely assumed vaccine cards proof vaccination. else intention? And?... Yeah south like katrina. least build levees etc. model prepared by Prof. Eran Segal from Weizmann Institute presented cabinet meeting last week suggested third dose administered people aged 40 would reduce daily number infections 10,000. third dose given people 60, claimed, would 20,000 confirmed infected people end September. booster given people 40, would 10,000 infections day.

That's told willing kill haircut last year.

I hope dying voluntarily Covid-19 hurts really bad intolerable mental torture. Thanks info 

Yep, I’ve taking supplements since last summer. Fizzy orange. full FDA approval comes see many mandates. say undocumented Yea think impossible. virus replicate spread it. adolescent unable define GRATUITY. 

Find legal document standard tipping requirement. ""no, that's me"" really seem think things affect you, specifically. would great everyone living wage without relying tips, that's reality right now.

Taking employee serving wrong. ur first vaccine, vaccine card said beginning service workers enforcing mask mandates needed _actually_ deputized. in, made special purpose law enforcement officer. Leave powers arrest weapon carrying, charge every jerk fails obey lawful order mask leave. charge every idiot takes swing service worker mask assault officer. Time make laws something good change. South African info basically gave 400,000 front line workers. going way tangent billionaires economic policy. replying comments regarding boycotting business shorthanded service workers based assumption business. original post also tipping service worker. Last checked, Elon Musk Bill Gates random Chinese food restaurant neighborhood. Homie take break news. know it’s hard believe still good reason hope. doesn’t sell well unfortunately studies what's earliest somebody could contagious exposure? 6 hours unlikely, right? Ah, crybaby POS.

Right now, social contract. Eat sit restaurant? Pay tip.

And ring (for sake easy math) 100 dollar tab, server expected pay percentage sale based 20% tip standard. means yeah, tip, still pay did. cost money.


If opposed tipping, stop going sit restaurants confirmed given restaurant A. Pays living hourly wage, B. make servers tip percentage sections sales.


If willing that, principled. cheap. breaking current, existing social contract around eating sit restaurants. two assholes equation. employer, you. want kick server much coward(or fucking self absorbed lazy) anything else ad hoc rationalizations.


And stop saying ""you"" me, I've never worked tipped position. I'm capable thinking inch past nose, unlike you. schools Maybe that's part whole sum meant. Since gives descriptive rather specific details hard guess. Bill Belichick: “We’re CVS.” son started daycare remember felt like perma low grade cold. Daycares schools fricken Petri dish. Wow. 100% um........ I'd say something flawed here.. promise us ignorant fellow here. Stay well Prost! Yeah parents, sister gf got boosted. It’s easy.
 Nobody needs wait. Esp front liners ffs.  healing factor, adamantium, retractable bone claws. ""Your former voters"" painted sides. 

*this comment seems political one side, fact, covid kills regardless political party. fact reads politically, politicized humans made fucking virus* Please don't. last time guys turned big L. Freedom free. saddest part reading stories day day knowledge absolutely zero impact anti-vaxxers. infection severe disease exactly? work casino UK. first started job masks legal requirement building. half players refused wear them, many complaining ""makes sense"" wear walking table, (thus proving fucking clue anything). management finally started enforcing worker caught Covid... well, enforced week. point people discovered could simply pay less £1 get thing sent said exempt wearing mask, which, despite legal requirement accept, casino allowed easier actually refusing service people wearing mask.

Now masks longer legal requirement number people wearing basically zero. There's 5 regulars wear them, rest bother. blame now, literally nobody else going wear becomes wasted effort everyone's part. wearing mask protects everyone around me, protect me, protect customers people I'm going catch customers?

I'd happy see masks becoming legal requirement again, also know many places intention enforcing rule. AZ resident checking Ducey prohibited exact thing happening fine me. Independent business owners freedom restrict access business right also fine me. way things going anti-vaxxer anti-masker sentiment?

Yeah, it'll common childhood disease. like polio. Plus creates new variants. Fire all. committed jobs.  Fortunately, that's efficacy works. means vaccinated J&amp;J, infection 29% likely lead hospitalization. instance, someone previously 10% risk hospitalization (not actual number), 2.9% risk. capital city TN (Nashville): 250 students staff members — 52 staff members 207 students — contracted tested positive COVID-19 since Aug. 9, according district's COVID-19 data tracker. total, 980 students 95 staff quarantine isolating.

This mask mandate.  Every single one preventable.

I-5 corridor here, 4 hospitals 2 counties requested National Guard. hospitals full, happy hear request granted Thanks heard ADE responses 90x? [dengue vaccine 1.5x increase hospitalization young children year 3. thought close worst-case even ADE-prone virus.

We seen ADE capable it. ADE early SARS vaccine research targeted N protien, none switched protien. ADE going happen seems likely natural immunity perhaps whole virus vaccines like Sinopharm anything happens selective spike protien vaccines. it’s safe patrons show random people front name DOB? weird… doctors give BS medical exemption cards people get around mask mandates. Everyone family (except me) got Pfizer. I'm getting nervous safety. eventually something sick bed call work school, come back day two later. Proof identity needed register voting, fraud rare. going ask, Oregon highly vaccinated? think we're less ideally vaccinated home work counties, apparently others luck people getting vaccinated:( 
Our small counties hospitals absolutely ravaged this, horrible. people still convinced hoax ""Inconvenient"" bit understatement. People worries kids going get sick disease vaccine exists FDA dragging feet approving it. I'm confused rather want taco hot cocoa, both. I’m sure lot know it….why wouldn’t they? may important discussion. wouldn’t know Tuskegee experiments done people government?  Hey, fellow Albertan. answers either wanted agree one, offer virtual solidarity shouting *the hells, people???* everyone around me. 3000 cases day.  many actually dying?  many cases already vaccinated versus unvaccinated?  Wish mainstream media would tell whole story, one shaped agenda. New Orleans well Speculation: covid-19 circulating 2019; happened Wuhan would call variant interest less-transmisable ancestor. Evil never seem like punishment deterrent. Thank kindly. ""no duh"" reaction. Mine love putting anything everything mouth. think entire house covered 1inch thick layer baby drool point. resources take care should, hospitals maxed vaccinated people urgent health needs turned away unvaccinated totally preventable situation moral choice far tell turn unvaccinated patients leave immune systems “own research.” state. Fuck state idiot people it. kids couple wearing masks. 

My son’s best friend whole family believe masks problem people vaccines responsible shedding virus everyone else. parents nurses! 

The little girl lives across us asked mom could wear mask school mom said no! 

I angry frustrated! Gaaaah! opppps, filled No, no, see, frustration inability form sentence, appears reading ability could also use work.

No, think selfish piece shit. too. However, I'm NJ Excelsior Pass work me. wish version. dad breakthrough infection Moderna. mild. didn’t get infected know even though we’re small apartment. Found Floridian. Dude know gloves still fingers. Mittens winterwear ones fingers bunched up. I've seen 5 house calls near home 2020, every cop present wearing mask.... also seen 4 house calls paramedics fire rescue scene.... wearing masks. Well, protect employees customers well. Early pandemic brought local police large container hand gel stores sold out.

They smirked like nuts. Yes. zero enforcement, really matter Rand Paul? 

Rand Paul: [I'll licensing board way ran room get phone download MyColorado app right, covid contagious deadly. feel businesses allowed regulate regards food safety? ""I've mask year, waaaah, forever""

How virus stops mutating spreading like wildfire? acceptable answer you?

How hospitals full can't handle amount patients are?

How majority population gets vaccinated? yes, think mandated. don't, complain mask mandates. There's reason kids vaccinations attend public school.

This ""I'm wondering"" kind question, passively implied expectation mask proponents expected wear FOREVER, ridiculous. far control, may second lockdown point.

What doubt ability pharmaceutical CEOs pass opportunity infinite repeat customers. Well think many 12 unders dying covid nowhere near many people 2020. roughly 1/6 hospitals ensure previously, let ride wave out. share taco :) Albertsons let shove vaccination card right Apple wallet. praised Twitter it, freaking convenient class act move ever.  friend vaccinated early pregnancy knew getting covid would worse. globally surely sample size large enough Plus booster may turn provide much greater immune boost initial 2 taken w/in month other. studies showed delaying 2nd dose elicited much stronger immune response taking 3/4wks directed. may find 3rd dose 8months road really awakens T-Cell/B-Cells - there's lot nuance immune system many people understand (me included).  exactly saying... required NPS builds crowded outdoor spots.

Nobody seemed care all.  Everyone's talking ""boosters"" ""waning immunity"", yet we're using Israel's data? guess way administer vaccines similar ours, unlike UK Canada booster shots probably needed soon thanks different dosing schedule.

Man hope mixing Pfizer Moderna turns surprisingly good thing originally got mix get fully vaxxed ASAP afterwards mixed feelings decision (some outside influence, related countries currently recognizing mixing matching “fully vaxxed” etc). *would* nice happened end effective guess we’ll need wait studies that. I’ve seen data AZ mRNA mix, much mixing mRNA. basically using mRNA vaccines tide us develop robust vaccine? Worldometer source. seems confused data. Link? seems like week criticism. Current vaccines provide sterilizing immunity individuals think work fine.  100% chance excruciating even survive. unvaccinated play ""Sorry!"" Unfortunately FDA usually accept foreign studies pass still available don’t take next booster? 2 J&amp;J studies combined total 47 people. one Moderna studies 50,000 flu vaccine mRNA booster one got before. I’m saying you’re wrong, it’s “common sense.” think I’m crazy / stupid watch low third dose adoption rate compared second. Hahaha, kid would adopt damned hard. Much easier make unfortunately. necessarily though. earlier studies showed delaying even 2nd dose 12 weeks elicited much stronger (multi-fold) immune response receiving 2nd dose 3 4weeks. assume booster provide immunity similar first round. T-Cell/B-Cell mature may surprised 3rd dose months line really kick immune systems gear. Falcons second favorite nfl team equal Alpha variant (Wuhan) Covid. comes Delta variant Covid Moderna efficacy Pfizer preventing infection according Mayo Clinic study 50,000 people. However, vaccines give 99.9964% protection death 98% 99% protection symptomatic infection hospitalization:  Again, understanding efficacy figures referred whether patients became symptomatic; required medical assistance. whether became infected contagious.

I'll another deep dive that, better understand certainly anadotally seeing vaccinated individuals contracting covid, semi-regularly.

There plenty things still learning vaccine, seen enough data suggest effective stopping transmission. delta variant may mute point.

But answer question, responsible public health. certainly situation would upset take covid seriously. necessarily translate forcing vaccinations. anyone anti-vaxx people observing test result vaccine efficacy. One bs arguments see spewed. ""I need research""...from who, where? medical experts trust now? youtube? Facebook? Lol fooling anybody magically go away, mean ability breathe.....they correct!! Shit laminated vaccination card... Yes, 250% extreme makes think 250 peecent low reluctant people got first doses may also go direction willing get booster since experience initial doses impacted them. case, long people get booster, it'll improve outlook community spread hospitalizations overall. Viruses mutate change. flu, there's updated booster shot every year. Also, vaccine efficiency last infinitely. time, wears needs another boost. thought common sense? brother got $50 gift card bought nice bottle rum it. jealous didn’t get anything since got vaxxed January. nice shared me. sure spite hangover worth tbh. struggle feel fools... ways one. Exactly, always tell threads send unvacinated elementary school kids back person school week. Pretty scary know many unvacinated kids class come unvacinated households, households care covid anymore. sucks. gotta get wins somehow. thanks places saying laminate free seemed like good idea...

Side note, wife notice written name getting laminated. wish death upon anyone, comes us all. Old young, even thousands died vaccine side effects, die time, both. Conscious individual freedom gift given birth. Use fulfilling life. believe right live outweighs individuals' life freedom, Everyone live life sees fit harming another.

If prove individual deadly disease inevitably spread you, fine, take action. Otherwise speculating future crime like movie Minority Report, believe fair assessment justice. fundamentally believe restricting another person's freedom choice think could harmed future.  


Again, wish death harm upon anyone. someone disabilities understand life harder. That's hand dealt, think fair make others bend self ego. fully protected 100%? 250% protected? data says Agree. girls show really short skirts.. boys too…

That’ll fuck heads. Maybe knock sense dad extremely scared needles (as he's fainted blood draw before), went first Moderna shot held hand. looked away said even feel it. I'm scared needles, too, get sorts medical stuff done, close eyes carry conversation it. Good luck thank part! 💖 surprise anyone? It’s like flu shot, virus changes you’ll get new shot every year. hospital service. “brave” enough wanna get vaccine, shouldn’t need hospital help get don’t feel well. basing recommendation based Mayo Clinic study preprint. Pfizer 42% effective preventing infection July. anecdote seems make data real.  6 inch. Going 95% 99% five-fold reduction hospitalizations, may seem like lot small rate increases huge impact public health. said Delta variant too, page got updated late winter. Another page addressing says infection provide sterilizing immunity individuals (which kind immunity keeps catching something). news articles since last summer, though. need help math one. Great, I'm glad live there. much country. Maybe makes sense there. here. 

It amazes people would rather live locked home, risk virus. makes even less sense vaccines. 1. Jacobson method vaccination Smallpox use 400 years. Founding Fathers inoculated 180 years Jacobson decided. 
2. Covid vaccines gone normal FDA process (10-12 years approval), emergency use writing.
3. Covid19 smallpox. Smallpox 30% mortality rate killed age groups humans, Covid19 1-3%, less 1% healthy. even deadly 1918 Flu, pandemic viruses 20th century.
4. Smallpox effected humans, animal source reservoir. 
5. Covid19 going seasonal flu, like respiratory viruses. Smallpox seasonal. localized never became pandemic (too high mortality rate), like Ebola. vaccines never eradicate Covid19 like Smallpox was. 
6. Covid19 becoming less deadly time, like every respiratory virus. Smallpox remained deadly mutate much (different family virus).
7. Justice Barret declined injunction, mean cases heard USSC. better precedent ""disparate impact"" make Court likely rule ordinances un-Constitutional. effectively segregates US population. Whites Asians access services, majority Blacks Hispanics barred. Grow needs lose license next.  1/12 well. watching booster news sure. I'm it. Get vaccine receive felony using fake medical card. But... lose weekend... mean everyone eventually need shots twice year? vaccines frequent?  ""Personal health decision"" lol. like unfounded skepticism derived youtube social medial takes. people would like believe qualified doctors. one time foolishness damn pandemic. think answers correct. means 2.5x increase amount antibodies system.

eg: 21 days second shot high level antibodies, I'm sure units they're measured in, lets say ""Parts-Per-Million"" PPM. So, 21 days shot 2 like 10,000 ppm antibodies.

Over next months, amount antibodies declines. data still coming quickly level, lets say 6 months dropped 5,000 ppm.

The third shot, increase level 2.5 times, raising 5,000 ppm 17,500. (Because expressed 250% multiply 5,000 x 2.5 that's have, multiply 2.5 *add* original 5,000) 

Now numbers absolutely reflect actual levels antibodies, used examples. remember exact numbers believe UK tried wait 8 weeks shots, US 2 3 weeks shots Pfizer Moderna respectively. 
 
Anyway main point, seems like Biden administration going recommend boosters 8 months initial shots. people getting bit early cheating system may robbing peak robust protection. area bad outbreak hospital systems overwhelmed, fuck stay home orders thing past--unless people suddenly going comply isolating contact tracing, sincerely doubt. Otherwise, mitigation strategies table, including stay home orders. Came say thing. went desperation. many unvaxxed people around coming it. went without hitch. understand dilemma always go point ask pick time plenty slots say today tomorrow take one. ask basic questions again, dilemma. personally blame anyone jumping line 3rd already past 6 month mark. Team J&amp;J get guess figure since CDC decided forget existed. exactly 8 months? state opened vaccinations pretty late (end April), I'd prefer getting sort booster Christmas-time gatherings. guy seminaries. I'd interested real data this. gut would suggest anyone willing get two shots also willing booster every year so. pretend live little fake town week? Why? Reporting cases greatest evidence vaccines work. enough problem getting people vaccinated need help get. Except reason ""taboo"" COVID (to use person responding to's phrasing) dangerous things people normally call sick for. point start treating like flu cold (ie longer viewed ""taboo"") would point almost everyone vaccinated (putting annual COVID deaths in-line annual flu deaths), look like ever going case without government mandate. lack vaccinations means we're stuck waiting game *hoping* virus becomes like flu (the likely outcome given long enough time frame guaranteed). 

We can't real return normal yet lack strong herd immunity we're already trying force issue going back mostly way things pandemic began (like treated things actually flu spreading). doubt lead lot people going work sick COVID spreading others that's used sick cold flu. Thus get never ending cycle mutations likely continue fester amongst unvaccinated relying natural antibodies constant threat next Delta-like virus could around corner putting even vaccinated risk.

If nothing current situation changes, there's real reason think we'll day like old normal we'll like new normal involve higher annual deaths flu-like illnesses, mainly driven new strains COVID. event like that, COVID becoming like flu makes less taboo rather people's acceptance higher risk getting severely ill dying will. actually lean towards latter likely outcome rather former specifically pandemic handling unfolded thus far. subreddit: “FDA approval means literally nothing. I’m going go lie pharmacy get third dose. Also, hate vaccine hesitant since won’t listen science.” Left start business work started treating us horribly came back lockdown.  impressive sounds bow page claim reinfections rare ""might"" happen delta variant. know still handling honest. getting ready start nursing school Covid happened feel like want persue career medical field anymore seeing way people treated.  put lives (and really lives families) line 24/7 they've received return big shit sandwich. think I'm cut it. got sick both. happy seeing boosters. literal kick ass lol tired this. like J&amp;J vaccine fell earth comes studies. go get two Moderna shots say screw it. interested continuing ignored. let know 3rd hits get hours. Pfizer Moderna still highly effective Delta. specific vaccine would add little. Issue seems reduction efficacy time rather vaccine protection delta strain. Everything wrong happening America, one sentence... Typical Bears 2nd half they’re trying push vaccine even caught recovered without hospitalization. Glad don’t live dump NYC. Third shot nearly bad second. First dose sore arm. We're going solid data NIH research: Smell urinal pass NYC. rest state isnt bathroom end going need make vaccines free counterfeit cards $100 so? booster shot looking likely, vaccination card laminated (ik might wise decision) done? write new one first shot vaccine second? Israel’s numbers way unique. Netherlands, UK, Spain Portugal highly vaccinated countries seen similar spikes. Common countries hospitalization death fraction previous spikes, unlike situation Florida.  folks work closely together many hours anyone wearing mask. saying spread took place work, curious state one. I’m even surprised. One neighbors cop said it’s ongoing issue department get fellow cops vaccinated wear mask. Basically bunch covid deniers. Moderna whole way through. There's big difference vaccine that's around less year vs vaccines around decades. idea long term effects covid vaccine understand send girls home shorts skirt shorter arbitrary length straps shirt thinner arbitrary width, can't send kids home show school maskless middle pandemic.

I still entitled opinion 8 months long. have, America. gets registered system app show I'm vaccinated antibody response shouldn’t basically considered unvaccinated? feel much safer vaccinated. I’m really worried long Covid. know there’s anecdotal evidence less prevalent vaccinated people wife can’t afford take months leave even it’s covered disability. wife therapist it’s continuation care issue clients.

It’s hard know think right now. fact impossible get took everyone get one means everyone hitting 8-month mark different times, rather huge groups people eligible day like last time. That’s question. I’m absolutely provax went hell second shot. I’d weigh much protection vs effects. Nice Numbers Spain falling rapidly done vaccination drive yet. think get 90% people 12 years old vaccinated.

It really interesting see fall wave.  Sadly NYC lacks resources actually enforce started request business owners staff vet people... staff owners want Anti-vaxxers violent morons. 1.3% people low income countries received least one dose Hospitals: bad, bad.

Yeah, Seattle big scandal one refused hospital, investigated, given slap wrist. scumbags danger community, dying would good news infecting many others along way.  Great takeaway pandemic: lot stupid medical professionals there. Given low ICU capacity, 4.6 ICU beds every 100,000 people massive community outbreak would rapidly overwhelm hospitals.

We US well states all, unfortunately.

We far behind unfortunately. fair, able go bars parts US, even 3 months ago. 3.3 deaths per day pop 11.5 million... Vaccinations work!  Freezedom point.  True, talking health inspections now. can't authority new rule Whoosh went groceries walk dog. I've asked paper couple times. I'm NZ whole country going full lockdown 3 days midnight one case discovered earlier today.  good news getting vaccine might help lingering effects COVID, vaccine help reinfection, still great got vaccinated overall. Sucks learn hard way, hope they're okay. Well, 279 million spent recall election decrease kitty bit. We've pretty good run. Here's hoping spread!! I'm happy live somewhere entire country goes lockdown soon case found, means take seriously good chance stopping tracks. short answer no. 

The longer answer is, depending healthcare provider, may digital option you. 

The longer answer is… really fucked whole thing up. live US. 3 months ago randomly speaking girl NZ Clubhouse. bar time. hearing classic bar noise background lovely, especially ephemeral. kinda teleported BC times (before covid) 

I remember thinking ""Your country shit together, good you""  perfect cut. Shoutout even opt-in digital passport.  booster coming soon. go!

Roll punches! got done last friday, issues far. chills, muscle aches/soreness, fatigue. Today(monday) feel normal. breastfeeding well, noticed significant change son(he feel little hot Saturday) amount milk produced. wonder we’ll able mix match. got J&amp;J I’m worried viral vector immunity, though suppose that’s trial for. unvaccinated individual one really risk single person? Sure, could catch spread it, vaccinated folks.

It’s like could clap back smartass reply face consequences. thing citizens cop dick pull camera. It’s closest thing sort power. I’m every single time one behaving badly they’re brutalizing someone blatantly violating rights. No. vaccination rates much higher best strategy.  give drivers license free.

Where free drivers licenses? CA $35 :( virus person. getting injured this.

People *dying* right now. Also, whats thing show buying alcohol? sort people ""enforcing"" this?

The problem concept, little moronic antivaxx shitstains think earth walk upon, cant even conduct public space

It's. Just. Another. Piece. Of. Proof.

Making physical *them* considerate children prooves let public. know one.  We've let bad situations get vaccines first, pretty low rate vaccination.

We've basically fully open months months point, excluding international travel. probably going week two country. Small price pay.

We hospital capacity vaccination rate handle large outbreak.

The strategy likely change early next year. ever approved though? don’t know much influence politicians FDA, see possibility republicans attacking funding approve vaccines. federal agency all, subject whims congress. Ya dems tiny majority now, may midterm elections, don’t know FDA finish process then. CDC's PR messaging departments face utter incompetence. absolutely mind boggling stupidity. Allegiant Stadium requires attendees show proof vaccination. T-Mobile Arena won’t far behind I've mentioned I've known several nurses anti-vaxxers lives.

That youtube video includes references description area, well info Dr. Seheult. Agreed wholeheartedly completely disagree. matters public health, especially pandemics this, helpful government step set regulations. long term solution get enough vaccinated population.

So they're using spin story sell agenda rational person falls apart says ""well actually working since 2016 work this""...

Its easy see right intentions... reason hospitals filling bad reach certain point start get lot deaths would preventable proper care. Yes, good thing thanks vaccination amount deaths per population infected quite bit easily change allow healthcare systems get overrun. Delta + unvaccinated remain much capable still. seriously seriously doubt it, least “on label”. 

The FDA pretty notoriously conservative stuff like this, unless there’s specific trials data mixing vaccines, won’t “recommended”. 

But doctors (more) free whatever always get second “first dose” pharmacy you’re willing lie.  Would “full” third dose theory “better”? depends inject 4th shot into. works best bunghole. city announced mask mandate yesterday (Monday). goes effect Friday evening. know they’re giving people time acquire masks change signage, 4 days? whole lotta spreadin’ goin’ 4 days. 20 day dying Alabama average. can’t find stats quickly they’re admitting people. Stop, /r/Coronovirus ""scientists"" already settled issue.

Neverminded lot factors time two shots, far 2nd shot cases question were, etc.

No one says impossible one slightly better other, lot science reading one preprint. Interesting. Wonder can't pharmacies here. 🤷‍♂️

Want mRNA jui️ce.   look upon New Zealand this. They've done outstanding job compared country/continent.  First Clinical trials another country 100 km away. later normal vaccination. 
Two half doses Moderna later full ones Pfizer may also delay 'waves'; if, x% people hospitalized go ICU, take (on average) week hospital getting ICU, max incoming ICU patients would (roughly) week max incoming hospitalized.

The totals may even out-of-whack, since time spent 'normal' hospital vs ICU may different, may full ICUs month hospitalizations fall. That’s honestly feel ultimately save situation we’re in. Flu got couple years ago diagnosed early doctor prescribed Tamiflu. Felt better shortly after. need equivalent Covid whole thing done, provided people get diagnosed early that’s similarly takes. vaccine still best line defense, coming second would treatment. Doubt it, specifically says 8months people vaccinated period March/April. 

Under 12 expected drop next month two afaik, there’ll good month time two least, even drop boosters. “Permanent”  also stands reason spacing second dose extra 2-3 months give 2-3 months efficacy.

I'm Australian I've seen first hand quickly 1 case become 45 cases 6 days (where city right that's locking 1 case).

The problem ""strong willed"" thing stubborn. would reckon nurses anti-vaxxers already way nursing school due stubbornness (which basically gotten school without) mind never changed.

Interestingly (or perhaps not...) big difference vaccination rates RNs, LPNs, BSNs. Let's get ahead ourselves. Here's site tracks measles. far, 2 reported cases 1 state 2021 (up Aug 6th). Yup. Sydney (Australia) lockdown 7 weeks failed act quickly. successfully dealt previous strains covid without locking Delta different.

They're opening anytime soon. They'll probably still lockdown October, unless want overwhelm health system, already struggling. side effects? original shot booster? sure countries policies, traveled another European country random test people without vaccin certificate, tested negative PCR test.

So really surprise without testing vaccinated people see problem.

The short answer road. Everyone panicking risk breakthrough cases vaccinated individuals, lock back get booster shots. Then, sometime next year we've reopened stuff again, new variant occur infects 1 every 70,000 vaccinated people show up, everyone panic again. perfectly safe go back ""normal"" soon children approved vaccine, never world prioritize unvaccinated favor vaccinated.  Israel also 3 week dosing interval like US did. UK Canada spaced much more. Singapore mix strict covid measures last week apparently.

Israel might best analog this. Uh purely anecdotal one side family one part India (Tamil Nadu) seem slowly slowly opening back (upper level schools, universities etc) seems think get vaccinated side effects, that’s fault, die virus, that’s bad luck.

That’s common logical fallacy lot vaccine hesitant people. disease makes zero sense me

I got vaccinated September part Pfizer trials. unblinded January mostly went back normal life, least normal possible given continued restrictions time. Indoor dining, indoor bars, hell I've bummed drag two cigarette total strangers. pretty far efficacy ladder point given almost year. Still caught COVID, least symptomatic COVID. 

Then got people like OP got vaccinated relatively recently sick. Weird shit man new thing get shot every 6 months? I’m already hearing talk lambda variant binary though, people stupid understand it? Even get covid vaccinated, likely lot milder.   assume get little sooner 8 months right. got second shot 4/29 odds Im going visit family holidays time. Would really prefer get beginning December option available. Right? live Texas. Texas California countries, we'd still top ~15 pandemic laden countries. Without them, United States would sink country second highest number cases right behind India whose population ~3x US. I'm jealous NZ's efficiency belief science. want make hats say ""MANZA"" stands ""Make America New Zealand, Alright?"" think go anywhere countrymen realize New Zealand real. understand booster targeted toward new strains, instead original strain. heard anything official yet though think plan offer 3rd dose alongside flu jab next couple months Thank sharing, much clearer now. Hopefully whole NFL will. We'd fucking things *and* lives let Covid general population without said population vaccinated first. I’m 42 still go yearly. thing adults kids 12?
Genuinely curious way here.  Except vaccinated people *extremely* unlikely get sick. masks ""necessary"" protect people willingly vaccinate people potentially carrying disease. disagree.

LA wallet here, scans drivers license automatically pull covid shot state database.  feel like study could ring true different areas country varying demographics many factors would thoroughly looked order definitively prove there's significant causation (vs correlation).

I think study would valuable investigate PPD/PPA (Postpartum Depression/Postpartum Anxiety) parents prepandemic. IMO connection makes sense would much easier draw reasonable conclusions prove point. fortunate take day. often forget everyone is. much normal life dependent people vaccinated people work are, perfectly safe. safe next couple months debate. WAY many people seem nurses.   Paywall. asking one single case Auckland affect someone Invercargill example? Would mind letting know process goes getting Moderna booster? also got Pfizer figured pharmacy wouldn’t allow pick booster already know had. I’d prefer getting moderna well Yes. it! BIL's hospital scheduled staff third doses starting next week. Good idea, we'll keep letting covid spread like wildfire keep mutating overcome vaccines, we'll get another booster shot every months.  South Island different rest country situation? Paywall It’s sad lie something free could potentially save hospital stay thousands dollars known moderate severe side effects. approach announced last week cautious reopening. try hold much possible allowing vaccinated travelers back etc. it’s going long time NZ ‘open’ like countries buying time? working solutions well?

Would like ask ppl share potential solutions stage know good ones peer reviewed. Part reason COVID dangerous put restrictions everything brand new virus one immune defense to. could infect wreak havoc several major systems body immune system could mount defense. Eventually (maybe even soon) essentially everyone immune system defense COVID they’ve either they’ve vaccinated it. immune system exposure virus, it’s much less likely make seriously sick.

We see flu virus caused 1918 pandemic. 100 years ago, caught that, body didn’t defenses lot people killed made severely ill it. everyone’s got defenses it’s one several flu varieties crop seasonally. one tests 1918 flu condition entering country it’s longer big deal. It’s coronavirus variants. it’s big deal makes lot people sick. years another cold. could titers tested see level immunity is, could least partial immunity would worth blood work peace mind you’d get exchange, parent. This. Thank you! time move on.  collective mental health world cannot handle much longer.  Decide getting covid vaccine - avoiding unrealistic. children fine. honest one believes 7 3 days. know cases unless got incredibly lucky. 

So I'd say us know ""couple weeks"" soon  Keep attitude? talking wish antivaxxers boycotted event planning attending hasn’t needed precautions it’s people travelling bring in. Seems like must leak border worker somehow  Lol - NYPD going regulating this. There’s direction De Blasio… mention, he’s even mandating vaccines police department. They’re supposed getting Covid tests regularly vaccinated enforced either. know someone police department hasn’t Covid tested since started vaccinated, along rest 50 something people unit. least half police department vaccinated that’s De Blasio cannot mandate it. mention, without FDA approval, mandates unlawful people work law enforcement biggest threat. can’t see system works yet… wake up. police officer going lose patience person isn’t vaccinated, anything, they’re going give free pass.

I’m fully vaccinated believe people get it. also don’t think it’s right force it. force privately run businesses mandates they’re even requiring state level. Cops aren’t vaccinated supposed enforcing laws don’t even abide by? Lol. It’s backwards. awake enough see lot pure scare tactics really strict enforcement regulation around it. It’s reach numbers. accuracy

It's accurate, false negatives main problem, obviously issue ability differentiate covid flu

It's incredibly easy, genomes two viruses nothing alike, chance something impossible happens PCR testing, every single covid case NZ genome sequenced agree shouldn’t that. Indulging things isn’t going kill though, “living life” pandemic might kill people around neckbeard works home stays home except masked trip store every 2 weeks, also want booster soon. got second Pfizer early May. 

I'm gonna wait patiently get one up, whole thing makes nervous. mate AKL supposed travel Queenstown weekend. Texas official vaccine registry?!? ""considered workplace death"" mean? Considered who?

I thought employers could require vaccine private right contract laws prohibiting employers so. like fired reason (except discriminatory retaliatory reason codified statute, e.g., race, sex, age, disability), fired getting vaccine. 

Can explain? handle workers comp many employment discrimination cases maybe confused. Makes sense lock ~ week stop spread since vax rates low moment. It’s big ask. relax bit population vaccinated. Cant wait come city I’m running back car grab oversized note card. Well Larry Page made over, rich.  Seriously, friend got $50 cash card getting shots late. Yes big deal obvious link border (like airport worker etc) assume it’s widespread long term strategy Australia either states this. Unfortunately largest state (NSW) soft got hand. outbreak started 7 weeks ago NSW recording 400-500 new cases day. restrictions implemented recently implemented 7 weeks ago. spread countryside interstate.

NSW got away suppressing virus without locking entire city state Delta different beast mess around Delta.

I'm ACT. locked 1 case last Thursday. 1 case already become 45 cases (in 6 days).

Long term, plan treated covid like flu WA seems want stick zero covid strategy. personally think best option, 80% population fully vaccinated (our goal, reach Christmas) kinda moronic stick zero covid strategy.

Time tell works out.  talking Israel? later analysis showed vaccines work. initial delta outbreak area 90% people vaxed, yet something like 50% hospital unvaccinated. 

Initial claims saying work comparing percentage hospitalized overall country percentages, ignoring epicenter was. 

Israel proves vaccine helps, going provide 100% protection vaccinated people need still follow precautions. got mine yesterday, third short Moderna. kinda hoping side effects would bit less harsh, sadly nope. bad second. think means two things:

1. Vaccination greatly protects severe illness vs. non-vaccination
2. Vaccination mean immune severe illness, especially older, immunocompromised, doses time ago. Wasting vaccines instead giving countries mutations break meanwhile there’s still people saying it’s hoax  Ugh go Anyone know booster get J J? Request artistic rendition.  I’m sure they’ll go whatever health authorities say. really expect fda/cdc downgrade millions Americans fully vaccinated want hold booster months? Referring nation racist. heard first folks. 1 case observed mean 1 case present. individual contracted virus somewhere else. likely people symptoms, infecting others. 
They way beat virus act fast strongly. one countries least affected Corona. ask work, one else guarantee anything need offload cases another state. Death rates go roof staff stretched. still bring boys yard? thought Taiwan overkill NZ definitely takes cake lmao. expect 1/2 3/4 people already taken vaccine US take booster. US states something like 70 million doses stock already. unwittingly become patient zero.

All pandemics go away eventually. past went away population immunity reached point could sustain either disappeared completely receded point required new generation unexposed individuals mature sufficiently large cohort could outbreak again.

Sure, COVID going away short term, ahistorical think 'go away' - point effectively non-existent vaccination routine thing - timescale 5 6 years.

COVID flu, influenza virus generates immune system effectually new virus every years. SARSII much constrained. I'm wanting contrary see cases way deaths (so far) look climbing - breaking point people hospital? yes, kept lockdown going, would eliminated. 

That point. Italy also stay stage 4 lockdown 365 days year next 70 years. eliminate virus point. question twofold:

-would actually better alternative?

-is worth long run given they'd import cases elsewhere time? funny everyone attacks woman decision. agree her... no. think get it... yes. butbthe reason many unvax react them. stop calling people stupid thay lose job maybe start listening you. fuck wants listen someone keeps calling dumb?   people care ""the economy"" literally demands millions killed change?

What kind fucked system that?

There never objective need anyone go hungry left unemployed anything sort due pandemic. productive capital destroyed lockdowns. 

It issue redistribution -- resources taken rich given poor duration elimination program.

The rich blatantly refused agree thing start, everyone (but mostly poor) condemned ""living virus"" instead.

No, was, still another way.

It’s right opinion. independent business owner, yes, enforce whatever feel right. local government, no, trust people right thing ensure safety. Don’t treat like kindergarteners. Let people put signs windows specifying vaccinated vaccination status welcome let individual people decide feel safe dining going gym. It’s ridiculous. saying almost beginning people 50 \~99.998% chance survival something, worry?

Banking survival alone bad plan, fun either live decades severe ongoing health problems. become severe want die endure yet another 40-50 years unlucky! legal US?

In Netherlands several companies asked government guidance whether legally, government answered; *shrug*, know, wait someone sue let judge decide"". go CVS receive additional dose right now. already approved immunocompromised people, pregnancy ""compromises"" immune system, even need lie completely.

American Hospitals Buckle Delta, I.C.U.s Filling Up
By Albert Sun Giulia HeywardAug. 17, 2021

The summer surge coronavirus cases United States, led domination contagious Delta variant, well second month, number hospitalized Covid-19 reached heights last seen overwhelming winter wave.

The number patients critically ill, requiring treatment intensive care unit, risen, too. Data Department Health Human Services shows number hospitals full I.C.U.s doubled recent weeks. Now, one five I.C.U.s reached exceeded 95 percent beds occupied, level experts say makes difficult impossible health professionals maintain standards care sick.

In many states, hospital workers seeing admission numbers resemble saw height pandemic winter. struggling find enough beds, others employees working overtime relying contract nurses emergency medical technicians. Outside hospitals, officials erecting large tents house everyone.

Dr. David De La Zerda, spent year treating patients I.C.U. Jackson Memorial Hospital Miami, thought early summer drop cases meant crisis phase pandemic near end. feeling lasted four weeks. According federal data, 300 patients hospitalized Covid Jackson Memorial Hospital system week ending August 12, around 70 beginning July.

For health care providers like Dr. De La Zerda, rise cases feels like déjà vu — emergence vaccines worsening blow.

“This virus becoming preventable disease before, new, know there’s something do,” said, referring vaccines, highly effective preventing severe illness death Covid-19. “There’s sense lack concern, know isn’t true we’re working hospitals.”

The share hospitals full I.C.U.s rising

Typically, coronavirus patients admitted hospital condition affects ability breathe, according Dr. De La Zerda. patient’s breathing deteriorates enough blood pressure falls low, taken I.C.U.

“Some sick immediately taken there,” said. “And it’s usually around second day admission either get better get worse, depends.”

The number people hospitalized nationally already surpassed level seen last summer’s surge, still climbing. states, particularly South, hospitalization rate approaching, already reached, all-time high.

Seven states — Arkansas, Florida, Hawaii, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oregon Washington — hospitalization levels exceeding recent winter summer peaks. signs rise hospitalizations slowing nationally, although Missouri Nevada, hospitalizations started rising earlier summer, increase may slowing.

More young people hospitalized. number children hospital — 1,800 right — number new admissions day highest ever been, based federal data going back October.

Relaxed public health protocols, steep slowdown vaccinations Delta variant created experts call perfect storm resurgence. Researchers say hospitalization rates one accurate indicators severe area’s Covid-19 outbreak is.

“Case counts dependent testing behavior, different potential biases come that, death data lagged,” said Lauren Ancel Meyers, director University Texas Austin’s Covid-19 Modeling Consortium, tracking coronavirus data state since pandemic began.

While strain familiar health care providers, aspects current surge unprecedented. patients Dr. De La Zerda sees younger, said — many 40. patients mechanical ventilators, instead high-flow oxygen systems allow speak, often talks them.

“Every single patient regrets getting vaccine,” said. “I don’t one doesn’t. look really sick, look really young. see somebody talking you, next time see them, they’re dead.”

Data reported U.S. Department Health Human Services individual hospitals. excludes counts hospitals operated U.S. Department Veterans Affairs Indian Health Service. I.C.U. capacity numbers based number staffed beds reported hospitals. Numbers hospitalized patients Covid based inpatient beds, including I.C.U. beds, include confirmed suspected Covid-19 patients. Good.

Companies right refuse service original double jab (Florida sits up....) 

""4-500 cases per day...? [Hold think kids vaccines hospitals aren’t overwhelmed signals clear path forward move Covid. Yes, immediate antibodies wane faster vaccines. much faster. Also, nobody saying can't get sick again. vaccine. Also, natural immunity provides robust b cells production least 8 months infection. cells produce immediate virus antibodies.  
Natural immunity also memory certain site virus, like vaccine. Vaccine produces antibodies memory cells spike protein general. Natural immunity produces memory multiple sites virus, general spike receptor binding domain spike.

I'm pretty content approach vs outcomes. people here. It’s privilege access vaccine protecting people saving lives. privilege access best healthcare resources facilities world. It’s privilege people freedom running businesses independently. It’s privilege government controlling decisions private businesses. Sure, general recommended guidelines place, set rules follow purposes public health we’ve along. every business owner would agree set recommended guidelines MUCH different forced mandate say many disagree with. Many lose business oppose, risk livelihoods, business source income. 

Now independent business wants require limitations restrict access choice, 100% right so. However, another business wants request either vaccination negative Covid test… able that. option falls within guidelines. another business decides don’t want ask anyone provide documentation eat restaurant, use gym, use services… socialize social media pages, put signs doors, people make choice whether feel safe giving places business. It’s called holding accountability making decisions. middle grounds keep people safe. doesn’t extreme. 

It’s Republicans see violation rights. It’s really anyone brain understands law. violation FDA approvals released even then, privately run businesses. government. government doesn’t control livelihoods, set guidelines public health becomes issue reported hot spot, take appropriate actions needed there. That’s appropriate level government involvement comes small businesses private companies. whatever want state federal level. 

This coming person vaccinated done “right” things throughout Covid. stand mandates. Mandating hospitals… normal. Mandating public settings… normal. Private businesses… abnormal. Guidelines adhere expected, way base saying enforced restaurants small businesses moment norm century. Government never intervened extent private business. world living in, people required show vaccine status order sit table dine? international perspective: example Netherlands dropped mask requirements almost everywhere already, lead uptake cases. (Still required public transportation medical facilities.) 70% adults already fully vaccinated, 84% 50 91% 65 people.
 
They also open nightlife terrible idea (new cases skyrocketed) closed again; new case count quite low now. well, faster light anyway.  making Delta permanent. last better vaccine it. It’s joke America won’t timely fashion, we’ll hell already broken loose. Maybe even then- looking FL TX TN GA and… Thanks two different sort related issues. Multi dose vaccines given multiple reasons. second dose COVID-19 two dose vaccine stimulate greater immunological response first dose alone, usually first dose alone effective enough. Pfizer Moderna went conservative two dose trial gate sure effective mRNA vaccines would turn out. J&amp;J running two dose schedule trial also, opted one dose trial shorten trial duration.

Boosters form may approved first doses effective enough given, time immunological response waned needs re-stimulated.

It probably intent, clear, current initial immunizations effective given currently approved state. one currently vaccinated, confident choose get vaccinated, initial vaccination safe effective. potential future authorization booster shot mean current regimen ineffective way inadequate. Maybe New Zealand move to. understand feel hurt patriotic pride, numbers speak themselves. Thinking like exactly led us now.

E g. EUrope could done coordinated measure, instead every country different policies COVID jumped like ping-pong ball countries.

It could worse course like US Trump, Brazil Bolsonaro LOL Americans least partially vaccinated 70% eligible Americans least 1-dose vaccinated, seems unlikely majority actually believe vaccine going transmit movements deep state unless they're playing pretty intense cognitive dissonance.   got December, January mass vaccination sites opened date second shot. “Fck that” -new zealand   everyone pumps trial vax system accepts Covid basically unstoppable spread population it’s okay everyone’s shot…for literally zero reason ""high mortality rate""

What talking about? Stupid stupid does. continuously evolving products. continue get better better. Thankfully, doctors nurses murderous psychopaths like you. line thinking right issues covid besides death happen body would able ramp memory cell mediated immunity, immunity symptomatic serious disease keep fading circulating antibodies drop much, even though protection death remains higher. 

Any immunologists want speak valid might be? 🔥 fine 🔥 Another posibility B.1.617.2+S:T791I (AY.12), Delta variant mutated Israel. are. Hence free safe effective vaccines.

You’re making really strange argument.

From day vaccines proven safe effective federal government promoted them, private sector, notably US military.

The military especially telling best electronic medical record data capture world, see patients entire history, risk factors, vaccine status one place cross reference anything, they’ve found vaccines absolutely safe effective mandated months vaccine drives post military members post vaccine sites stood get vaccine Americans home abroad.

I’m sure much US Government could promote safe effective vaccine. Nonetheless, pregnant associated with:

1. young;
2. encouraged get vaccine healthcare providers;
3. enhanced risk due stresses pregnancy places body.

(I agree point 2, likely pregnant people less vaccinated others age cohort). means COVID pregnancy likely serious tragic groups.  What. The. Actual. Fork. 

What wrong people?  Rapid test antigen tests get pharmacies. PCR tests require expert running laboratory. mercua isnt blatantly discriminating people? NZ tiny nation bottom world little outside contact, fairly high mortality rate comparison places similar standard…seems like fools gold standard! Get shot, wear mask, stop complaining

Good little minion, stop thinking, government Yes WEP. agree Taiwan also handling well.

Everyone's going get eventually anyway. economic harm country covid will. got J&amp;J felt literally side effects. eat immediately afterwards maybe thats why. I'm literally excited get shot offers protection deadly virus. going appear MCU? I'd like add China conservative policy vaccination.

China vaccinate elder people first, instead choose slow vaccination avoid side effect them.

And contraindication vaccination, example anyone GBS (Guillain-Barré syndrome) allowed vaccination, even full recovered one. GBS ok US CDC guideline. Save issue international pilots idiots country mistakenly trusting less quarantine, would say Taiwan handled pandemic better New Zealand.

Life pretty normal though we've accepted trade off. Would NZ willing same? time J&amp;J seemed like best choice one done wasn’t first vaccine kind. wasn’t worried viral vector immunity time since looked like would one done deal.

Reminds January 2020 people first starting notice COVID media outlets still referring SARS-CoV-2 virus. thought “SARS 2? Well first SARS didn’t really anything United States nothing worry about.”

Then, know, everything happened. Moderna Pfizer need delivered frozen, delivered, thawed stored onsite 30 days 2°C 8°C (35°F 46°F). First off. - Stop. going let pass by. 

Second - New Zealand home largest Sāmoan people outside Samoa. Māori make 17% population. proud, multicultural nation embraces Differences sees shared culture strength. tackled COVID well work together beat this.

$187,880,000,000

Moderna $15/shot, $45/american times 330,000,000 Americans.

Could walk get shot. found kid close contact someone tested positive. still need wait 5 days 7 days exposure test changed delta earlier? didn’t see sitting next her. sitting gate nearby. Airport packed. everyone noticed, beyond obvious. Later baggage claim, away everyone waiting corner, hear someone blowing nose 75 feet away. is, shame. thought nothing coughing blowing nose, loudly, front 100 people. cant stop thinking it. least flight home seeing parents first time since everything started. gross even pre-pandemic etiquette pediatric version may well different dose. wouldn’t competition adults kids availability. 

It may also help make kids feel better see mom dad get shot first. went first took kids get flu shot last year. Imagine mercy millions people refusing take even basic steps mitigate disaster. Good New Zealand. They've handling amazingly well people able enjoy way freedom last 18 months. got it. funny.  wait vaccinated send back school? 4 levels here, keep mind Auckland level 4 week rest country 3 days. level 4, move level 3 still restricted movement,no gatherings etc levels go back 0 community cases long enough I'll pass, thank much. Feel free move New Zealand. Oh wait, families literally separated let people in. flying back states September get vaccinated first day back. still dont know shot get. studies getting J&amp;J later getting one mRNA? going move Canada, read better wait doses, schedule kinda fixed around 7~8 weeks. 

My Canadian girlfriend coming states. anything special get vaccinated roll right cvs? Let’s… let us.*** sure getting downvotes. person responded stated “the name virus coupled previous epidemics blew made think wouldn’t different.” point virus appropriately named 2019 one knew would blow not. Blaming media coupling name current epidemic previous ones claiming somehow downplayed seriousness virus somewhat revisionist. knowledge virus evolved claim January 2020 could predict health economical impacts virus, therefore named something different, inaccurate. got first shot January. state (Missouri) dropped ball vaccine availability drive 4 1/2 hours round trip get it. would've loved get swag - hell, even nice sticker - happy gotten vaxxed. 

My dr told morning get booster. least time closer. 

Still hoping sticker though! Pfizer here, 48 hour timeline follows reaction dose #2:

* Shot administered 1:15 PM. immediate side effects, released go home observation.
* Resumed work 2PM-5PM
* Went gym, leg day give arm got shot break
* Made dinner. Starting feel little off.
* Went bed.
* Woke next day still feeling off. taken day work anyway. Derped around played video games.
* 26 hours shot: hits me. Started getting chills, temperature little bit. Feel nasty exhausted. took nap two hours, felt lot better. like flue week compressed single afternoon. 
* Make dinner. Immune storm almost over; feel lot better eating.
* Went bed.
* Woke next day feeling fine. vaccine becomes effective, percentage improvement performance results smaller increase total performance. example 200% improvement 50% effective vaccine improves efficacy 25%, 200% improvement 99% effective vaccine improves efficacy 0.5%. short room improve less effective vaccine is.

And actually non-trivial performance improvement. means cut breakthrough cases factor case looks factor 2.5. Hospitalizations/deaths vaccinated people would likely cut least 2.5 factor, potentially more, every vaccinated person boosted.

It’s good improvement.   vaccine works (which people far smarter assured us) really matter. draconian leaders

It's draconian leaders *we democratically voted for*. comfortable know gets us best outcome. past weekend major teachers' conference Wellington, attending couple hundred teachers country, including groups Invercargill Dunedin. including large Auckland contingent. Sunday night flew home teaching two days. takes one Auckland teachers infected country. Pretty sure joke, believe disease called Covid-19 first observed 2019. I've looked seeing conflicting reports. know whether third dose (booster) Moderna half dose? (50 mcg)? Right!!

80% people sub want use Southern States scapegoat anti-vaxx movement literally affects entire world

There far many comments like ""let die care, lmao hospitals overwhelmed"" every person every state thinks exact also affect sane + vaccinated people states well know sorry dumb joke  go CVS get one. say insurance ID require it. Yep especially covid Yeah. expensive Nordics near top. That's government handing money like candy ease economic burden. Opening schools month two away vaccinating children idiotic. I’m guessing quoting old articles can’t imagine scientific risk vs reward analysis current situation would lead conclusion. Hoping you. 

I really hope start sending vaccines elsewhere, idiots don’t want anyway. sure anyone get reference sure reminds Madagascar. Maybe depends are. Provincetown massive party data showed vaccinated people get infected get symptoms. suspect identified source extend shut down. silly they've committed it.  got vaccine ran cards made copies them. mine even good card stock, essentially copy paper.

Then, derived type argument capitalism sole responsible contributor vaccine. again, it’s wrong. effective government allows successful capitalism. capitalism Africa, South America, parts Asia, yet don’t see level “wealth” see US Georgia law. Im wondering cops exception. data infection/transmission % drops? Even study fails mention effective J&amp;J actually preventing symptomatic disease. says 67-71% effective hospitalizations. Pfizer Moderna studies state effectiveness symptomatic disease 67-71% effective hospitalizations 67-93% effective symptomatic disease. big difference comparison.

Packed restaurants/bars/events.  AZ approved Medsafe give wanted to. there's need now, enough Pfizer arriving vaccinating 50,000 people day. That's per capita rate US peaked April. want see bill transferred state hospital. hope people top notch insurance plans.   Agreed! vaccinated relatively early due in-person teaching, six months second vaccine lines almost day start school year. Knowing vaccine efficacy waning I'll going back classroom without social distancing vaccine mandate honestly pretty devastating—I'd clinging hope they'd approve accelerated booster schedule like Israel's five months. 1.

She NZ. I’m blessed NZ hasn’t got major Covid outbreaks now. So, mother law teacher religious school half people vaccinated. Day 1 conferences get covid tested exposure (she vaxed) week going students houses talk families without masks. normally watches daughter one day week asked could mask given risk feels worth it. do. right deny then? wife feels really sad it. Mostly mother putting fight it. end family Europe even met child year half... feel laws lucky ones wearing mask minimum. Thoughts? New Zealand access vaccines like US does, take look Texas/Florida's ICU capacity now. 
   
NZ would get asses handed twice hard tried open up. Sorry missed posted it, hopefully found answers.

The UK government strategy getting people first doses quickly worrying getting smaller number people doses quickly. appears working well. Pfizer want expose additional criticism/etc recommending something outside directly tested trials. CDC equally cautious, made recommendations conservatively regarding timing/intervals/etc. They’re basically right now. schools south open without masking decent mitigation strategies. It’s whole level entitlement (good choice word might harsh enough) people turn noses available vaccines global pandemic, also spew misinformation antivaxx memes attempt poison others getting vaccine well. 

It’s strange groupthink it’s really hard watch people know least sort used respect fall it. 80% 16+ It’s nightmarish think toddler close three years old point, known world without pandemic short months life.

Seems like fantastic gig. Appreciate have.

This society dealing with.  Often one dose MMR enough people. second dose recent addition— definitely got one MMR kid. Also there’s blood test get test immune response. doctor check titers MMR see one dose gave immunity. vacine rolling slowly NZ?  know robust immune response? Yikes, definitely! That’s crazy stressful! 
Pre-Covid pretty hard core anti-Vax pockets live too. pretty good outbreak years ago. believe that’s state made school admissions rules stricter. Bold assume live dystopian hellscape USA. going controversial, want good uptake EUA vaccines kids, schools need tie mask requirements vaccination status.

From . two months ago, half parents 3-to-11-year-olds one survey said child would likely get shot becomes available. 

Otherwise schools require vaccines fully approved would take us late next year. Vaccine huh Ok! I'm really glad hear eVil Chinese vaccine providing good protection there. 

As aside, forget context comment was, saw notification thought scolding me. ""Chile"" sometimes abbreviation ""Child"".  PTO days replaced sick days, boss longer cares calling sick year LOL. Likely younger children need much oversight parental interaction older children. OP I'm double vaxxed Canadian. I'm still quite cautious public appearances. I'm afraid dying even hospitalization, cautious isolate suddenly 2 weeks look like job. 

I also 5 year old. end mild case due vaccination could get full case. Plus notice soon enough could spread friends parents maybe parents vaxxed.

This you. overall surprised American attitude. would take 3 years numbers like achieve herd immunity

Well [Herd immunity Delta variant mythical impossible, expert vaccines work.... forever. Booster shots less necessary rate infection spread goes (i.e. people vaccinated). Yay.... Going second AZ tomorrow. :-( choices, (""You cancel, go end line, maybe get leftover Pfizer month two. Maybe."" ) I'm happy get decent vaccine.

But, South Korea, they're looking this, hospitals quick treat it. we've 3 recognized deaths 12 million doses. too, I’m thankful vaccinated early (as PA student), I’m graduate start working (#1 choice ED) would really like get booster that... I’m getting nervous.  doubt double shot booster :-). Punished responsible. I'm novavax trial too. Got vax January I'm strongly considering thing. I'm seeing lots people online novavax trial saying they're going get approved vaccines, headline feels like time same. 

Please keep us updated symptoms! thinking would prefer Moderna well. misunderstood. I'm commenting said police. I'm saying laws can't written compel show ID certain scenarios, course happen. 

Police cannot compel show ID whim. FWIW I'm fully vaccinated getting booster shots. 

Sometimes deserve getting downvoted really think here.

People already dying breakthrough cases. I'm saying likely get severe time goes on. get complacent. I'm sorry want hear, let's check back 3 months.  course want cash incentives. schools mask mandates ""masks optional"" since Florida? I've really trying find data schools mandates (I think safely assume ones without masks badly) hard find differentiation. 418 now, 1 hour later! would totally it. QR codes. carry vaccination card.  really hope long haulers stop long you. I'm incredibly sorry ended getting sick. Thank service. citizen neighboring GA, south majority anti-vaxx movement sadly. reason people daily, including couple stubborn family members. double KFC. Right. That’s I’ve banking on.

Place looked like Pompeii, frozen time. Calendars March 13th indefinitely. eerie. Walmart day pharmacist literally wandering store looking people give vaccine toss nearly expired Pfizer vials. either encountering already vaccinated people, anti-vaxxers - seem luck finding anyone would like dose even 12+ demographic (and tons back-to-school season). isn’t ideal, locking immediately, difficult manage spread. Lockdowns get dragged weeks. seen happen Australia. mental toll economic impact orders magnitude worse. snap lockdowns, it’s possible get back zero relatively quickly, thereby saving lives, get life back normal. come home recover. Definitely come contact people reduce exposure you. tell isolate 2 weeks wherever are. get home recover. likely feel ill entire time, life now. thank additional context! getting benefits, long term contracts helps understand pay seems excessive. figured good reason outside hazard pay, makes sense. soon, may qualify later.

It's strong argument.  moved 100% back up. pretty much feel  considering delta raging I'd say sooner better. ~4 months, expect we'll swing. 

Whats efficacy vs delta @ 8 months? winter last.

Far people protected severe cases COVID time around. mean well, asking minority cater majority. want get sick anti vaccers, us always wear n95 stay home.

Fuck that. stay home get anything suck up? here, friend. data disagrees you.

Unlike mRNA vaccines, [there evidence suggesting J&amp;J gets STRONGER time, due robust cellular immune heard much noise regarding J&amp;J boosters, compared Pfizer Moderna. Honestly could listed every state. Still sure haven’t even considered reducing indoor capacities addition masks. “strategy” vaccination.  Well.. American hospitals one particular region anyway assume needing boosters every 8 months (or whatever) on, getting shot means due next booster sooner would otherwise. KN95 KF94 protects parties.  Obviously needing vaccine would best news. are... Right now, one really cares whether COVID actually eradicated century. people talk eradication, they're talking whether COVID disappear go back pre-COVID times within year so. Clinical trial results pediatric subjects.

How know that? Around Day 4 began get really worried, even questioned whether I’d made right choice. really something completely wiped days days. vaccine risk I’d rather take, wish way test level protection. also wonder whether intensity reaction vaccine correlation much protection have. took polio measles decades go away, immediate. diseases still pop poorly vaccinated demographics. I'd careful today's data, NY shows Florida data anomaly (reported 3 days data day early, happened before) that's probably helping boost numbers. still increasing, definitely plateau yet. makes point violate people's space. Wishing rode pandemic New Zealand. fuck rest world still don’t vaccines, Americans shot #3. Sharing Caring guys lol  saying 5% people took AZ died blood clot... among developed blood clot, 5% died?

According article, still extremely rare. 1/50k 50yo 1/100k 50yo develop blood clot. going over, like almost every country world. Unless NZ plans keeping borders closed indefinitely. works exponential growth scenarios. Small actions early prevent take giant actions later.

Do get lesson ever though? Nope. soon cases go arbitrary level deem low, eliminate restrictions. Europe plenty room hospitals without lockdowns. One word: vaccines. do. I’m fully vaccinated adult. Moderna, too, effective Delta right thankfully.  sucks throwing expired vaccine right now. keeping enough hand vaccinate gotten yet, going waste. think missed point. Florida high bed person ratio elderly population. doesn’t give huge advantage sheer amount elderly. elderly also concentrate certain cities like south central Florida Yes, much less likely. vaxx, odds (43F) went many multiples, talking infinitesimally small numbers— going 0.1% chance death to, say, 0.001% huge drop. Going 4% chance hospitalization maybe 0.4% (or less) also enormous drop. I’m using Economist model pre-vaxxed odds: [Economist consider somewhat higher risk, various chronic issues get quite ill colds flus.

It’s don’t like odds smaller, point argument could *even tinier* me, individual, less motivator get booster given sick got vaxx. I’ve read booster increases immunity 250%, way related intensity vaccine reaction we’re talking possibly weeks unable function. wasn’t like cold, like could barely function human five days.

All say booster, me, stopping spread, protecting vulnerable populations. much less odds (and definitely scared COVID, trust me) getting severely ill hospitalized. think general conversation booster start steering direction lot us bad reactions jabs.

Given death/population ratio US, probably saved 55-60K lives thus far. would definitely initial uproar, they'd eventually get wanna see favorite team person wait, haven’t released guidance yet. Unless you’re immunocompromised. Even school needed switch (at least temporarily) virtual, would take time. equipment used many returned schools (not sure still there) would redistribute.
IMHO would good idea redistribute cases kids need quarantine. School shut far worse virtual sustainable? Regular boosters rich countries may temporarily divert supply poor countries, covid vaccines limited natural resource. time scale production basically infinity - there's continuous demand rich countries give 2 shots year, we'll make enough fill demand. PCP much way. never got flu shot started seeing ~10 years ago. 5 doctors share building, several primarily geriatric care. position basically ""you're going sitting waiting room bunch 85 year olds walkers oxygen tanks, least give flu.""

Fair enough.  Possibly they're also including ""suspected covid"" diagnoses, since without test, left guessing. Legit Caribbean schools take you?  NZ year half prepare! mom's boyfriend lose shit. pineapple Mr. Bill Lee sit on. 

Not enact mask mandate, virtual options school year, either. take (vaccinated, luckily) kid get tested today developed symptoms. get results days, considering almost half school either quarantine isolation, I'm betting positive. Thanks, Bill Lee, unpolished turd. face face members community multiple times day. It’s bullshit. FTP. Except vaccines least wear mask refusing vaccination. preventable deaths. 2020 much harder prevent without vaccine. Pass collection plate. Kids dodging school shooters, state mandated tests designed exploit profit, bullying, covid guaranteed catch, learning classrooms stocked unqualified teachers hired fill room qualified ones keep quitting. 

I’m glad don’t kids. ""Sorry, none people donating. Donating implies sense civic responsibility. die."" actually people can’t wear masks medical reasons? feel like I’ve ever heard anti-maskers say don’t want wear mask. Many parents also going back mandatory in-person work. every job done remotely every company accommodating policies. Virtual learning adult supervision, parents equipped caretaker stay home kid day work.

Even schools accommodated it, many parents would unable without quitting job.  makes province's concerning +500/day case rate seem quite benign.

How bad things need get people abandon ideology clearly conflicts reality? Yes live covid eventually. However unwilling allow kids lambs slaughter. kids opportunity get vaccinated yes live it. Good, I’m sure hurts heart seeing people suffer reason selfishness &amp; ignorance. many customers bored game store really anyway? huge risk what... NZ currently TRULY essential businesses? Power plants, water treatment centers, hospital employees can’t go work. person commented said “kinda sucks”. response even mentioned take early, drawback, replied back comment saying worst thing early take it. said already. Still better nothing. Sorry defensive. country government opposition pushing vaccines, lot anti-vaccine propaganda spreading Facebook vaccination stopped 58% months now. decided effective government propaganda versus Facebook. restrictions lifted vaccination rates plummeted. It’s better early 2020. vaccines go long way personal responsibility. COVID would come ass, people would realise wearing butt mask protecting others yourself. using money combat starvation poorer nations? don’t understand this. European country received lot J&amp;J vaccines? Currently J&amp;J even delivered third supposed - far know received vaccines J&amp;J Europe donated developing countries, covax etc.  Sadly news coming Israel/Iceland painting different picture. figure Israel Pfizer 39% effective infection delta variant. buy n95 masks Amazon? Caring health others?! Blasphemy. talking ideal world bullshit instead real world results. say actively choosing take money server. actually happens matters far happen. Totally, get hesitant trust FDA. don’t even trust them, mentioned fact approve things banned places. I’m saying personally don’t want rush it, would even less trust giving son vaccine. needs get it. It’s scary enough knowing could one deadly side effects it. thought knew FDA put sooner people called complained, would feel even nervous.  Students allowed opt mask know sarcastic dismissing many options available protest nothing enhance viewpoint. haven’t seen single reason people can’t mass email call representatives school boards. It’s possible ignore group - 30 plus percent vaccinated don’t need silent hospitals schools fail. last reported community case COVID-19 New Zealand February. citizens living without restrictions although international borders largely remained closed. interesting country (Argentina) was/is lot controversy around time vaccines, vaccination started, lot second doses delayed people complained it. media made people believe first dose immunity could expire didnt get second dose fast enough lol Thanks repy. work closely unvaccinated folks cannot always distance never wear mask. Thankfully lot cases Maine get 3rd shot less 3 hours ago. Hopefully keep Delta free one catches it. nations early successes virus, Australia, also shifting strategies brace COVID-19 deaths era disease stay. one world's vaccinated countries, Singapore may first show really means. 
""If countries start move towards endemic COVID-19 strategy, expectation related deaths, although still unclear many excess mortality many would occurred regardless COVID-19,"" said Teo. anybody ever defined constitutes ""severe"" disease? whether need hospitalization? shit scary. 9 year old school right TN several fellow 4th graders already COVID/quarantine dad works school whole track team test positive. didn’t even option virtual school year, there’s mask mandates, schools aren’t even contact tracing year. It’s like walking minefield whole family.  highly unlikely parent opposes masks would prefer vaccinate child remove restriction. Vaccination far extreme precaution perspective. refused Medicaid expansion. Many doctors left state, many rural hospitals shut down.   New Zealand's health care, like lot economy, [relies immigrant want avoid massive panic inevitable cases start happening open up, need prioritize immigrant workers health care field, even start paying bonuses foreign HCWs willing show early quarantine now, ready spikes happen even they're 90% vaccinated open.  looking supporting protective using immunobridging.  you. overall surprised American attitude.

How living bunker rest life looking you? i’ve planning beach paying fee dump kinda deters lol already noted, unless immune suppressed, reason yet third shot, least US, approval third shots healthy adults hasn’t happened yet.

That said, half question: Rumor third shots coming October, reached eight month mark since second shot. I’ve read, recommendation expected “stick brand”. 2021 isn’t getting much better breath coming valve dispersed similar way breath escaping edges cloth mask?

^(This legitimate question promote discussion. hope come across a) [^(generic internet Tennessee state held school board meetings recently insane anti-mask vax parents got whined rights freedoms because, know, them, kids getting it. recommended expand Delta. Back June 10th. scroll transcript.) city headquarters KKK! think charts Worldometers based data yesterday. don’t really think shitty them. It’s scenario deal regulations they’re governed by. fine though. Minor symptoms day big swollen lymph node days. dead probably top .001% immunity virus! Caturday? BIL, wife two kids moving FL want kids wear masks school. Neither BIL wife vaccinated. hope manage get sick. feel like BIL SIL going sitting ducks (no pun intended). Nothing do, though, people going make choices, often little regard else may impacted. definitely sucks see happening family. expanded heart inflammation seeing kids.   Exactly. thing going go away. Obviously get many people vaccinated possible quickly possible. always covid form. Breakthrough cases, spread among unvaccinated, variants, name it. 

It's never going go away entirely, need start getting used it.  Masks protecting others wearer. see doctors nurses wearing them, patient. someone tell vaccines pushed hard doesn’t stop getting transmitting COVID lessens effects? Genuine question, understand telling people get vaccine lessen effects requiring enter places etc still transmit COVID doesn’t make sense. Politics? vaccine shots given weeks apart. subject, worth get PhD law want work academia? met lawyers far know none doctors. Yes, meant ""children included"" part ""we get vaccinated"". think would best time period? Goddamn incredibly shitty them. surprised point, still damn. Glad better now. said timescale 5 6 years somewhat pessimistic. pandemics last 3 4 - last (possible) coronavirus one - Russian Flu - effectively that.

True first ever pandemic shut immunisation natural immunity, result likely functionally really see reason think things take usual historical course. Yep. Friday 13th. March 2020. End Day. CDC charge approval, director already given statement significant child die virus. data child’s school. second week. Parents allowed campus. Temp checks gate. Masks day, optional outdoors encouraged anyways. cases. It’s elementary school 500 California. still report figures CDC, CDC reports daily. 
Seems like testing info last updated 13th. last 7 days (6th-13th) 327k tests, average 46k/day. % positivity day ranged 20-25%.  
The state capable 100k/day, unclear they're choosing to. think whole situation hypothetical doctors simply going start rejecting patients, even they're making ill-advised vaccination decision. 

But many anti-vax doctors. Almost doctors strongly recommending patients get vaccinated. I'm enjoying flood travel nursing positions I'm getting. Highest score goes Texas 36k bonus 5 k week. 

Na I'm good know, think every public health agency, every level government, along every business association private sector service organization, needs stop feel-good, help-your-community pro-vaccination messages.

They instead flat-out say ""Get family vaccinated, DIE. DIE horrible, painful death full suffering, loved ones live last days ventilator, struggle take one. Last. Breath."" Positivity rate nearly 35%. pretty safe assume actual numbers least triple confirmed numbers. Louisiana joined fight.

At least New Orleans cool culture though Eventually yes. course. need analyze you’ve full vaccine course you’re 8 month window, you’re outside window, you’ve booster. Why? time shots could better? didnt know  need magnetic levels! really. voices pro vaccine movement Alabama Mississippi. think wouldn’t get news? course would.

It’s anti-vaxxers believing demonstrably false formation.

I’m looking forward voice pro vaccine movement states haven’t seen it. articles showing I’m wrong someone overwhelmed doctor fighting vaccination, please post articles.

I’ve seen past day one article mother disabled kids fighting options school ignored. Where’s support? worth try. Like Amazon's ""almost stock - buy now"", even though know warehouses full restocking. Maybe move *too* San Francisco feel safer indoor spaces indoors vaccine mandate. think I'll stay San Diego. mayor Dem tried NYC style rule. many months say wait get third shot immunocompromised? 6? feel less alone people still waiting list get vaccinated it. supply demand go it. would immoral let vaccine get thrown away tell white lie increase protection around you.  Concerning humans detected Florida. making broad generalization apply every place shortage.  Sometimes shit happens, especially hire lot young, inexperienced workers entry level positions. work assisted living, got December - February, hopefully we'll included September/October! Got booster yesterday. Side effects aren’t bad, definitely noticeable. Biggest complaints extremely sore arm pretty awful headache. Happy extra protection though. easy. Theyre common folk. Ya know.morons. Getting lockdown cycle always going political tightrope countries done best far.

New Zealand probably manage defeat spread time. However, they're 80%+ vaccinated, start open world, rapid spike cases deaths. Even get 90% vaccinated opening up, initial case counts hospitalizations likely cause panic among population, calls return elimination strategy. government rapidly lose popularity, remaining hermit kingdom simply unsustainable long run. rural areas tend staunchly conservative would put money vaccine rates dismal areas. I’d also willing bet very, little mask usage. surprised they’re cancelling opening football game, church Texas. bet highly pissed people. away school sports? least time being? Yes know America full overweight people away physical activity kids actually get bad thing. I’ve issue school sports way exist ever since high school 20 years ago. Schools (generally) spend way WAY much time/money/attention sports enough academics. goes colleges well. Cant answer I'm firefighter/medic we've seen vaccinated guys get covid since Delta started. we're around covid patients almost every shift even wearing masks, chaotic environment using aerosolized treatments recipe reinfection thought right get one. I'm sure everyone that. /r/wooosh statements rather jokes? perspective medical ethics, we're talking drawing arbitrary line different points grey area. knee-jerking it? there's grey area, room discussion. Yep sounds dumb  Best comment year.  Obviously constantly abusing position. almost definitely turn annual booster. Probably timed around time influenza vaccine. Hell, I'm sure there's plenty work done create combined flu/covid vaccine. High viral load [and partial antibody escape. two issues contribute. confirm, seems 60-70% state literally give shit thinks COVID fake big deal anyway. feels like we're living nightmare here. here. Zero side effects Pfiizer shots Fully vaccinated today’ actually time “concerned” month ago. Ok, surely recognize greater 4% doctors might fence vaccinating general public, 96% required vaccinated condition employment, right?

I'm say doctors push vaccination right; I'm pointing remaining 30ish percent unvaccinated people may seek ~20% (?) doctors think top priority get every last person vaccinated. Sure, get one docs, docs also disproportionately selected. Hawaii still mask mandate. family works medicine. I've advocating friends/coworkers strike year now.

Sorry, throwing bodies crisis solution. Good doctors nurses essential healthcare staff dying save lives miserable degenerates believe healthcare staff personal servants.

It took year conned pay, abused management patients, free pizza slices instead raises PPE many nurses hospitals girlfriend worked start quitting.

They're understaffed patients literally dying inadequate care low-key I'm hoping wake call society get shit together healthcare system. CEOs getting 8 million USD bonuses hospital pretends can't afford $10 per person PPE joke. record low unemployment best time years get job pay, economy seems quite well moment.

And yes donated lot vaccines also taking fair share either.  keep moving goal post. mentioned innovations achievement, correctly pointed two things mutually exclusive capitalism.

I criticizing capitalism. I’m saying capitalism doesn’t exist vacuum, purest form destructive since doomed always end monopoly, tech stuff basic Economics class 101. So, think it’s fair add caveat one-dimensional person weird hard specific ideology comes attributing merit creation vaccine. pediatrician’s office accept unvaccinated patients (except genuine medical reasons). That’s one reasons chose practice daughter. 

They’re unreasonable, actually suggested spacing immunizations daughter (just couple weeks shots) “overwhelm system” high risk, oxygen, receiving RSV monoclonal antibody injections monthly. pediatricians keep anti-vaxxers’ children practice. rationale I’ve heard use this: don’t trust recommend vaccinate child, would trust situation? cannot doctor people trust me. 
   “And predisposed trust me, exposing liability nuisance lawsuits accusations continuing treat you.”  Like common cold, never go away. yearly, Quarterly variants. 


We need come plan live this. plan Kill eliminate it. never go away.  know. beds high percentage older people wealthy people, helped much sensible decision-makers power. ex big anti vaxer, many doctors refused see us, secretly made happy. since divorced her, kids vaccinated sleep peacefully night.  could even millennial he's immigrant Pakistan Afghanistan. Polio extinct world, still endemic places. Delta strain becoming one successful viruses modern history. lungs

It's torture. torture. called *mucusboarding* enhanced intubation.  remember hearing early mRNA vaccines could ""reprogrammed"" within month ready distribution address variants. booster take advantage technology address Delta variants? reason current distribution reformulated address variants? Well, finally! think could try harder sent entirety 500 million semester they're giving money millions 200 million jabs sure along 2 billions China, poorer countries get help. possible. play NBA Jam? takes 3 shots 'on fire' lots still struggling first one.    Yup.

*""I'm doctor. either decide follow advice, need find another doctor.""*

Replace ""doctor"" ""lawyer"", etc would still make sense. hired expert solve problem you, think know better, wasting time here? would spectacular delta last wave size see US combination natural immunity existing vaccines get us pancoronavirus vaccine 12-16 months without another huge surge.

I wish confident actually happen. seen admitted yet.. maybe four got I'll enough wound ED. Amen. Concisely stated   Without proper medical exemption, case everywhere. least sense triage.

Vaccinated peoples get priority unvaxxed ailments.

Why?

Simple.

If believe modern medicine, get use it.   Would also mean anti-vax patients congregating Dr. matter time catch other. Hawaii sovereign nation I'm sure would adopted NZ model. better worse, however, part US. 

Even without tourism numerous ties connecting state mainland, notably 40,000 active duty military personnel deployed there. decade seems like long time wear mask that's medical opinion it. I'm worried effectiveness shot got Feb. want get booster. No. Vaccination decreases risk severe symptoms/death. 

Just like choose vaccinate, doctor also choose treat. 

You act like doctors people. imagine advocating people wear seat belts coming work every day treat mangled people flown windshield? 

This doctor got point said they've enough. tough watch people dying could prevented.   take test return us regardless vaccination. places make test - Maldives year job take test transfer every island, vaccinated He's 40's, grew rural India great access vaccine \~38 years ago. keeps ICUs getting overwhelmed gives time people get vaccinated. 95% people ICU Covid unvaccinated. early winter 5-12 year authorized get vaccinated. lol one florida rental plates weeks ago. fully vaxxed nyc though :)  r/angryupvotes  doctor sending info vaccines state pandemic area throughout year. office virtual appointments, they’re starting see patients person too, they’re vaccinated, masks required. vaccine, in-office visit. 

We let people run natural consequences actions. Make selfish choice? Okay, don’t get play rest us. People pretending bad thing requires critical thinking people like think someone themselves. 
the entire scenario selfish - getting vaccinated *they* want, isolating socially distancing would interfere *their* life finally get sick *they* deserve treatment hell anyone says otherwise. bonus multiplier!!! wondering would start happening - assuming solo act. anecdotally heard sentiment lot consider, really want act honestly, really want help people. take oaths seriously.

Reality never option them. guess vaccinated deal overwhelmed hospitals hope best emergency. don’t want downplay much…

It’s true US donated month China donated entirety.

But SELLING way doses, WAY doses, US allows sold American plants. vaccines cheaper Moderna Pfizer. That’s still extremely valuable service world. They're talking modifying bring back 95% efficiency instead 90%, necessary delta variant. 

We've vaccines 100s diseases evolve evade them. absolutely ""a near certainty"" coronavirus mutate like that. Please make statements like unless studies back up.

She need anything special, I've confirmed myself. It’s becoming common delta variant. 

[100 children week dying 

[Only 358 children US died July number definitely go increased infections seeing children delta. 

Even child deaths COVID “rare” they’re rise. Wishing NZ best. Delta beast. caught COVID Feb 2020 masking lockdowns months thought mental break, imagining weird prolonged issues body. Mainly provider believed me. knew chronic issues already had.

16 months later, shit still keeps changing. I'm trying get back work life, legit can't. people could head moment feel/understand daily frustration like, would know things worth risk.    Well god speed let’s hope continued lock downs pay NZ, feel PM got re-elected far reasons handling pandemic  Well oat something wheat situation, rye? Quarterback Baltimore Ravens already infected twice covid. Rather people like that, anti-vaxxers imo.  Well one person reason say wary. clotting issues sutg certain vaccines. 
Some people reason concerned 
We fit one group 
A clotting disorder life threatening Good bad kids burning inside moat Thats method heroin addiction  Like actually listen

The people NZ following leadership they've incredibly well country entire pandemic. don’t seem understand difference.

We maybe ten million ready expire. 

We plan giving 150-200 million boosters

Do see point irrelevant? need use 15x 20x vaccines ready expire… vaccines could go vaccinate world. outlets failed mention study ""bad results"" also looked Beta found even worse immune response, already data J&amp;J works fine Beta. Sounds like fear-mongering tbh. Lab results one thing, real world same. think saw one study days ago indicated real world efficacy. also vaccinate kids let rest unvaxxed deal choices themselves. adults responsibility completely nonsensical. logic, thank government *everything* consume private sector, ""allow successful capitalism"". That's moronic.

Capitalism drives innovation achievement incentive competition. Period. Government regulation invalidate that.  bit delusional. Anyone saying “lockdowns best strategy, look New Zealand” severe case survivorship bias.  Fatality around five percent Australia

As much aware syndrome

And hospitals open

Still want blood clot LOL ironically dress code year Metro Nashville. ""Unvaxxed,"" ""Paritally Vaxxed,"" ""Fully Vaxxed,"" ""Boosted"" categories? Pray virus away, amirite? could currently but, rate things happening Delta, far young deaths year overdoses. Thanks Captain Obvious!

So surprised NYTimes found time publish neocons ranting getting Afghanistan I'm hoping go museum soon I'm thinking people believe science going less likely step foot one. free Krispy Kreme got jabbed. didn’t know time. fluid situation Delta changed lot. Ah yes typical pea brains, obviously don’t know implications shutting even cases COVID largely non life threatening. Maybe NZ’s incompetent govt actually vaccinated it’s people wouldn’t cower reported case COVID   Imagine boot government much actually JUSTIFY lockdown ONE case. thank you. thought supposed six month booster shots eight. something change? I’m 5 months. Think I’ll 6 month mark can. Curious “most Americans “ means.    Misleading title. one day worth cases. Still, Florida terrible place live due Covid   guess praying. stupid.  Take tylenol loading dose 30 mins vaxx, make sure take another dose 6 hours first. get night, morning, take another sure, ought good go. Danny Avula, head Virginia’s COVID-19 vaccination effort, suspected might problem getting pastors publicly advocate shots members church referred “the mark beast,” biblical reference allegiance devil, minister wasn’t sure lot pastors, based congregations at, pretty hesitant charged, immediately invites criticism furor segment community that’s board that,” Avula said.

I can’t deal intentional ignorance. Saying vaccine “mark beast” criminal.

Edit add - said another comment, people Alabama, Mississippi Florida don’t want people low opinion barely functioning states, need speak take action.  possibility vaccine resistant mutation exists. Lockdowns unpopular, mean option needed. Overrun hospitals pretty unpopular too--so excess deaths longer-term illness.

The problem is, least US, individuals literally fight every mitigation strategy (vaccines, masks, contact tracing, lockdowns, social distance). strategy eliminated principle alone conditions warrant it. Found Joe Rogan's alt account. Florida Man letting freak flag fly.  get booster already? go vaccination site say vaxxed yet got another dose? desperate Taiwan. I’ve signed months still waiting call up.  take 150-200 million doses vaccinate people already gotten shots. 

...Which change fact millions doses expire given boosters. Obviously perfect solution, like said situation terms ethics. amount time energy put wearing simple mask/vaccination could power medium sized city. I'd wait assume we're peak cases. Many cities counties opening testing sites testing *real* block lately pharmacies booking days even week out. Even home tests (which counted here) sold almost every place I've seen. 

As testing comes online, surprised see another spike. Hopefully translate stress hospital system, may.  post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Shots literally zero sum strict definition. 

Currently 32% global population given least one dose. That’s almost 2.5 billion doses. Pretty impressive honestly.

I’m going assume arguing good intent. don’t think think 68% global population lives remote villages.

Yes hard reach places. Yes governments make vaccine distribution hard impossible.

But aren’t yet. aren’t past low hanging fruit. countries ready, capable, eager deliver shots arms. need doses. could give doses. aren’t, we’re keeping third doses.

Congratulations, passed crank test. really better antivaxxers. sort attitude part problem we're facing. endemic New Zealand globally. living complete isolation outside world (including essential services imports/exports, etc) really viable? Clearly not; new case demonstrates, always ways Covid get country. 

Hence point measure nothing aside form delay inevitable. sake people New Zealand hope delay much longer.    means you......LSU fans coming Rose Bowl play UCLA. Well crisis pay, critical care pay, healthcare workers nurses quitting pay, calling national guard assist pay, yea basically. exactly thought read headline. makes sound like doctor relishes fact unvaccinated people dying, that's case. Wow. That’s crazy. Last year refused buy vaccines. Said wanted make homegrown one. Hope finally bought some. hopefully USA could lend helping hand once. Nope. Far right loonies.    dont want see dying. Go die cant see you. Ahahaha! SC, 87% people 65+ partially vaccinated 78% fully vaccinated. likelihood majority deaths coming age group. 

so 13% (or 22%) people accounting 80% deaths. every fan Stargate knows ancient Egyptians actually advanced us since pyramids landing sites aliens. must special space chemicals back Mid late September, time Pfizer Moderna get numbers order 3rd quarter earnings call investors October. joke Hmm could seen coming … hopefully, people experiencing first hand , vaccinations hope delta surge shows signs subsiding they'll open simultaneously implementing vaccine mandate visitors. least number idiots dwindling daily. it’s traditional employee employer relationship, it’s likely strictly covered individual contracts.

FIRM believer anti-vax moms (mostly) created they've systematically ignored doctors.

Source- anti-vax fear/less education/mistrust docs. Finally found pediatrician listened explained. Child completely vaxed. Thanks vaccinated! Hope enjoyed area. Worldometers already reports Georgia 1.2 million cases. puts 17th 50 states per million cases. Boost 🍆 So, NYT article boosters referenced new Israeli data Monday suggesting vaccine efficacy **severe** disease fallen 55% seniors. first I've heard significant drop vs. severe disease. can't find Israeli report anywhere. anyone? They've pretty much given enforcing though. flew day saw tons people walking around terminals without masks.

On plane, flight attendants say ""Please put mask on,"" walk without verifying so. couple sat next keep mask on. flight attendant said something them, they'd wear properly long enough flight attendant get two steps away pulled again.

 [United's ask twice unmasked passengers put masks document incident without taking action. I'm also looking this. I've never felt sick 2nd dose. I'm fully committed getting booster, i'm higher risk anyway, matter time prepare feel like that, ever good time lol.  Fine, *type* virus. 

Better, asshole? even bad Chicago. Cook County state, they'd 8th best state country per capita cases. guess want get ahead it, cases risen, they're still 5% positivity. youngest 4 5th birthday February. I'm genuinely curious whether she'll age ""older kid"" bracket approve vaccine littlest kids.

I might jumping line soon approved 5+ anyway. Feels shitty protecting 7 year old like ""Keep holding line, preschooler! bureaucracy!"" want entire family vaccinated ASAP point feel pretty good grasp risks associated Delta vaccines, I'm far concerned former.

I wish kind parental waiver could sign get kids vaccines NOW. None trials anywhere near live I'd enrolled one those. School starts less 2 weeks. Maybe ask pediatrician get vaccinated off-label adult vaccines fully cleared FDA. 

We've done everything keep kids getting sick remote options pulled, Delta raging school start feel like we're sitting ducks waiting inevitable outbreaks.   Bulloonies gonna pissed HC vaccination mandate... least people.

I approve, take upvote. Florida needs this. So, rest U.S. need get numbers down. work paint sip company Oklahoma, primarily okc area, go rural oklahoma lot, particularly southern areas near texas. get cities towns literally zero mask usage. I'm betting less third vaccinated. given guidance states remote learning options provided either. open up, ignore R0 delta, mask up, cross fingers. bought enamel pin, mostly piss anti-Vax assholes work. It’s made month far. 🤣 first glance seems little ridiculous since doctors repeatedly treat morons blame time......but COVID different. people harming refusing get vaccinated and/or take precautions whatsoever. actions literally caused thousands lives lost. 

You could argue refusing treat people life threatening cases COVID refuse commit getting vaccinating if/when pull ethical choice. Letting one selfish asshole die means able continue spreading virus.

While think refusing life saving treatment grounds done now, alternative even future scenario even dire consequences, might. Society sick too. Win win. No, I’ll let y’all irrelevant side conversation guess. I’ll keep puppets myself. true strains due lower transmission rates possible boosters could make true Delta well. December me. Hopefully there’s protection variants then. Ugh. forgot Florida capital earth. Shouldn’t matter much. healthy, normal, person gtg. Heck, don’t even healthy. Apparently it’s 100s thousands. Texas strong vaccine tourism too. NYC apparently documented cases didn’t count Toss pool. Maybe get attention  yet great treatments severe disease

this false, India's decision back middle May 2021 use cheap generics show great improvement 31 RCTs led 90% drop cases deaths 8% fully vaccinated  Thank you. really don’t understand people get rude nasty. No, unvaccinated people hurt *everyone* clogging hospital rooms degree care becomes unavailable rest population. mean like ... physical, paper calendars?

That fact quite bizarre. think I've seen one since high school late 90's Yeah still think need separate medicine politics though.  Really hope one surprised this. vaccines require boosters. Flu vaccines yearly thing. makes sense can’t say I’m disappointed. learn new word today? Good you! blue understanding do. Keep learning! NFLPA strong union relatively speaking.

R° 1. That's works. Viruses vaccines work like bacteria antibiotics.

The strain bacteria survives specific antibiotic, spreads another person survive antibiotic.

The vaccine trains immune system recognize specific part coronavirusvirus. exposed it, immune system knows fight it. still get infected, get much faster, possibly without symptoms all. immune system weak, probably hard time even added training.

If mutation arises, successful able spread (see Delta outcompeting strains, even recent ones). means nothing mortality fact used vaccines. 

PS: Delta likely arose India, unvaccinated population. vaccinated lead mutations. Mutations random. think misunderstood meant “natural consequences.” someone doesn’t want take vaccine, don’t get hang around rest us (including vulnerable). they’re making choice selfishly, don’t get part society, society work together care other. matter doctor brought up, listening it/caring they're qualified tell would fucking listen?

UPDATE: city Dalton declared state emergency response rising number COVID-19 cases hospitalizations. Whitfield County reported 700 new cases last two weeks. first state emergency Dalton issued pandemic.

Mayor David Pennington says Hamilton Medical Center filling COVID patients don’t enough staff support it. declaration calls city employees paramedic EMT training assist hospital’s staff.

""Everybody experiencing tight personnel issues going long. hospital ramping back again, know they're going need help,” Mayor Pennington told Channel 3.

Dalton Mayor David Pennington says Hamilton Medical Center reaching numbers saw virus' peak. Monday, declared state emergency, 63 patients hospital COVID, 12 ICU, 8 ventilators.

""We trained EMT's, things like that. people stock shelves, whatever need us do, we're help them,” Mayor Pennington said.

Dalton Fire Chief Todd Pangle says first time department assist operation like this. Less 24 hours declaration, firefighters already hospital learning helping with.

""All guys emergency medical response certification, also EMT's well paramedics,” Pangle told us.

In times like these, Pangle says hands deck. firefighters took oath protect community, imagine would look like this.

""When send people there, that's people can't draw from,” Pangle said.

Mayor Pennington says Whitfield County help city staffing needs comes it.

Pennington told us 38 percent Dalton residents vaccinated. encouraging everyone get vaccine slow spread ease burden hospital. think agree that.

Or read manual one get ideas. Here’s portable/home/acute care one. believe it’s one models national stockpile.  That's always been....look countries highest vaccination rates, Malta, Israel, Iceland...all near ""herd immunity"" levels vaccination still saw huge delta spikes cases. It'll thing every season seasonal mutations well. we'll roll next year's vaccine last year's virus (like flu) it'll never 40% effective. 

And still idea long term effects vaccination. mean seriously began investigating mixed vaccine side effects February publication June....5 months....conclusion "" effects worse mixed vaccine groups adverse reactions short lived, safety concerns""....this passes bar safety trial nowadays? Y'all insane. vaccine hesitant educated (PhDs etc). Stop listening narrative meditate, think minute. Shit make sense

A vaccine forcefield prevents viral particles air breathe infecting makes mount defence intensely quickly. meantime virus replicating shedding, logical say whatever virus sheds breakthrough vaccinated case likely resistant vaccine? survive Covid pretty nasty long term permanent side effects. Vaccination severely reduces chance adverse cases; death, concern here. We'll see effect school reopenings trend.

My kids started school last week. live highly vaccinated community widespread support masking (and, course, mandatory masking schools). Today received notice least one Covid case already confirmed younger son's school. feeling touch go year long. like wearing nothing, no. pointless. stats back use cloth masks.

Unemployment one factor. obvious things going well. example, [a Reuters overview mental health income loss know got ""best time years get also taking fair share either.

That good all, fact, that's exactly problem... Right huge push *more* people get vaccinated around world, many vaccines going waste.

Rattled stressed, prayed guidance. Then, mother another relative urged get vaccinated, took sign God. West drove Winn Dixie supermarket rolled sleeve first two injections Moderna vaccine.

This frustrating. good Christian without thinking everything come God directly. It’s like story man sitting roof flood refusing help others “God save him.” It’s ok believe God doesn’t dictate every aspect life. Free exactly says. It’s think best. need sign, look around. Wallgreen’s, CVS, Walmart. signs….”Get Free Covid Vaccine today!” lose license, took oath. Completely unacceptable. Even amish smart phones look motorized transportations (via loophole).

But, stand since people getting vaccinated reasons. Baptist means believe baptizing professing adults. churches every possible belief Baptist label. central authority certifying Baptist churches, start one. let's hope so! plan staying strict lockdown forever? like Covid going away Ya there's issue allowing religious exemptions area debate.

 free practice religion take vaccine hospital free deprioritize treatment business free deny entry based religion vaccination status medically able take it. Again, definitely debate. medical exemption pretty cut dry murkier. Congrats achieving bronze, dare knock Massachusetts winners podium.  suggesting delta existed without antivaxxers?

I would wager far parents care, unorganized, remain silent. feel like essentially send kids school catch Covid. 

Same. *doing* letting kid go school? Oh, that’s right, I’m going work don’t end sick *and* broke. Gah. words, Covid Threat Level 5: Shelter Place, Texas, Sequel. Hard imagine anything despicable sending children deaths name political culture war.

May sound hyperbolic, that's is. Reducing mask usage increase Covid transmission, means sick children. hospitalized, die. hope every single one people permanent no-fly list see point, interpret everything power prevent illness death.

youre going encounter idiots people different opinions, known day 1 M.D. career path.

Describe today someone 2000 they'll probably want end right No, that's good idea though       suppose I'll since clearly live here.

Your claim ""little guys"" different policies larger stores (like Walmart seem think exists here). That's true. Also, hell going visit country hotel quarantine, even it’s one week? read vaccine. It’s impressive made one. hopefully start get vaccinated send Caribbean.   Getting Covid taboo way getting cold not. effort urge people stay home last year, social pressure really emphasized caught Covid, must something shouldn’t (IE socializing). stigma never went away people still uneasy idea catching Covid all. Unfortunately 90% number applies vaccine gives sterilising immunity close 100%. current numbers put efficacy infection Delta 40 60% Pfizer AZ likely lower vaccines. means impossible herd immunity vaccines. Kids need vaxxed give personal protection, sadly able protect vulnerable can't vaccinated strong immune response vaccine. freedom religion ends threatens welfare society. could foreseen this? /S Sounds like trying spread FUD me. try ignore stuff like Reddit plagued shills bots pushing agenda. number companies *are* developing variant boosters sounds like authorized round boosters recommended. Maybe order online get shipped? went got tested last year per company policy (because left state...even though went cottage middle nowhere lol) wait hours too. place texts turn next, see place line app, saw 20+ people front drove home (30 mins away)and ate lunch drove back. went inside building turn, people crowding lobby (noses out) 2 nurses yelling people follow rules. absolute shitshow, paranoid would catch covid *there*. feel you. also car without a/c 1994 feel too, although sitting driveway since covid hit I've using husbands car wfh never drives anywhere, change soon. herd immunity improbable point? Reminds Miami curfew nearly year. Lot good us. think you’re okay buddy, really don’t think it’s worth worrying unless condition would make covid worse even get sick you’d cough like worst. Don’t worry. Viscous? No, prevent people getting sick dying food drugs.  NZ needs enough vaccinated people hospitals risk overwhelmed. goal permanently eliminate virus. 3M auras good N95 masks. He’s going test case sell unvaccinated. availability monoclonal antibodies one two reasons DeSantis gives declaring emergency Florida. Air travel important worth it. important people get know cultures important people able see families.

People get know cultures see families air travel existed air travel cheap. Americans time work, using slower efficient methods transport (such rail buses) would Airplanes kind weird target, given small part problem.

They're part problem less amenable quick fixes parts, they're going stay small proportion problem long.  According article 55% severe disease 65+ got 2nd shot January. Can't really say without seeing numbers I'm guessing selecting first people got vaccinated risk. Here's analysis read Israel data shows stratified age efficacy well 80% people age  still don’t feel same. going gym 4-5 days week second shot. Even going first second dose. haven’t gym since day got second shot( got second dose Pfizer 8/1/21). Watching guys kick COVID's ass damn impressive. seems government planet see two inches past ass make quick necessary decisions pay huge dividends near future. people young consider healthy think comes catching COVID IMO also routinely around people might vulnerable catching covid vulnerable adverse outcome (like kids immunocompromised adults) better safe sorry. depends entirely staffing and, remember part, KIND PATIENT RATIO CURRENTLY HAVE. cut way back elective surgeries, cancer patients, physical trauma, mostly covid patients, heck no, decidedly normal. there's enough staff maintain 60% usual bed count, 85%, no, decidedly normal. standard covid lot people never getting sick Weve give dreams, based age, public health official, wouldn’t bet able kids amount time left amount time would take “safe”. Would able freeze eggs? imagine enforcement questionable best. 80-85% non covid patients sure beds covid patients take less room non covid patients makes think don't? reason lockdown case itself, crisis could've potentially lead to. qualifiers besides early positive test? (I'm assuming age big one.) needs higher up. Arent incredibly expensive? Daniel Griffin saying months. That's true even Multnomah washington county experiencing bigger wave last summer early year. Less last winter though, can't said rest state basis? Lambda outcompeted delta everywhere right, sad ridiculous sarcastic positions can't identified.  Why? satisfy bureaucratic expectations FDA made? smell legitimate N95 masks too. agree Amazon full fake shit.  talking schools vaccinating kids diseases infections extremely likely hospitalise kill pick up.

And trying compare widespread vaccine passports denial entry/service everyone country across many services sectors? Irrespective age, health status etc. 

So no, I'm avoiding question, hoped would see obviously silly was. That’s encouraging hear. ask explicitly? point know 7 people breakthrough infections SF Bay Area, got positive tests right around symptoms started, none seem gotten offered sort therapy. way Thank goodness. stop treating obese people well? shy 65% fully vaxxed, eligible. cases driven non-vaxxed/anti-vax. province seems hovering 200-600 cases per day. Locally, one high school student knowingly go party infected. Reports say 16 teens infected, number easily higher believe anti-vaxxers go get tested. 

It's crazy. speak Georgian….some got vaccinated breakthrough cases rise wear masks. It’s giving severe anxiety weeks. bad teammate Cole Beasley fan downplaying vaccination effort emphasizing ""freedom"" what's best fellow man  Gov. Abbott apparently symptoms yet, I'm guessing he's either early stages infection, he'd stay asymptomatic anyway.  anti vaxxers

variables: 

going get vaccine Indo likely involves waiting big crowds/long lines.. risky scene showing appointed time developed areas planet. 

also, vaccines widely available Indo ones advertise less efficacy mRNA vaccines.

i think cultural responses vaccines Indo comparable anti-vaxxer culture US.  think lambda double secret probation  I’m scientist, totally anecdotal likely varies person. diagnosed covid St Patrick’s day year. Waited 90+ day post-positive result vaccinate. First dose mid-July, Moderna. First dose knocked ass day. Fever, vomiting/diarrhea overnight, arm soreness. went second dose past Saturday, pharmacist asked dose 1. Told above, said, body likely treated dose 1 dose 2 due still natural antibody presence system. speculated dose 2 would easier body would treat booster… exactly happened. mild 99° fever (I naturally run around 97°) mild arm soreness one day, nothing else. still cautious preventative measures public feel pretty well protected currently. still go booster 8 months (or sooner, CDC end changing recommendation) responded without seeing question, seems, take care things order: 

So, seem reject idea COVID spread virus requiring physical exposure someone else, think coming from? Wow found pandemic twin! almost everything same. Also find KN-95 comfortable. Even got Moderna double-jabbed! (Not early March though) worked well far. good question Nah they’ll get kicked campus hazing messing anything  data unvaccinated vs vaccinated? country can't vaccinate like country elected bolsonaro

First all, tone xenophobia, buddy. Also, might wanna check numbers again:

Administered vaccine doeses per 100 perople today:

Switzerland: 106

Brazil: 79 need congregate, drive gov mansion honk horns middle night. one said pandemic would end 2 weeks, except politicians pundits.  Thank you.  don’t think people even thinking they’re saying want FDA keep going slow. What’s plan vaccines don’t get approved kids anyway? Live pandemic mode forever? May well approve now.    can't say normal fatigued week half 2nd pfizer shot.  Issue fucking mask mandate, send ship...throwing water balloon wild fire going much. debasing feel like everything tumbling backwards goals end sight … want road getting life back fully

What part life *not* back wear mask places? restrictions re-introduced masking? Nothing ""tumbling backwards"", life effectively back normal *despite* 100k+ new cases day US. short months ago go eat, see friends family, go bar kind live event. gonna act like end we're still lockdown? Sorry i'm going interject wrong. definitely give people antibodies request them, qualify small window get them. prescribe much can.  Oh no! 
 
Anyway… Yes, want something better surgical cloth masks. Sadly, think we're past point wearing masks protect other. think we've already seen highest level compliance we're going see. primary focus protecting oneself good quality products fit well. course, also protects others.

I kids know good options small faces, suggest visiting /r/Masks4All. several recent threads discussing options kids returning school. sub features prolific members used filtration products industry long Covid. They're knowledgable helpful. Also, sub allows links vendors (not allowed here).

Also, [this video Aaron discusses options kids seems well regarded. description underneath video, link google drive data vendor options product discussed. feasible New Zealand, make sense call ""overkill"" context. Yeah ""leader"" perks.

My question this. patients (in Texas) early stages Admitted, eligible monoclonal antibodies? yep   local infections extremely high, rather long time since vaccinated, types occurrences seem inevitable. One thing seemed odd, common us give monoclonal antibodies people test positive asymptomatic?   downplay this, isn’t 80-85% considered normal/optimal hospitals/ICUs? I'm also surprised random eurocuck sleeps bed jewish gold seething country can't vaccinate like country elected bolsonaro  literally less likely congregate. Yeah I'm thinking heading city picking couple stash medicine cabinet. know we'll probably needing eventually desire go sit boiling hot car 5 hours again. knew would take long time came prepared books, snacks, drinks etc gotdamn HOT.

People freaking “declining antibody levels”, example, don’t good understanding immune system works. point one studies mixing J&amp;J legal basis saying courts uphold it?

The landmark precedent case [Jacobson v held states municipalities power pass laws forcing people get vaccinated (as in, get vaccinated fined), provided there's compelling public health interest (the case discusses exact meaning length) reasonable measures taken, allowing registered physicians certify medical exemptions. even anything going public buildings.

Separately, HIPAA (in relevant part) means someone access health records job can't disclose others. EEOC, OSHA, courts already said there's problem asking proof vaccination.

Just days ago, emergency appeal Supreme Court Illinois college policy requiring vaccination rejected heard Justice Barrett, leaving college's policy place.

It’s really businesses feel like math changed aggressive variants like delta lambda.  messing calculations, countries trying figure new numbers. yet. country fully booked November. I'm NJ too. Someone said hipsters. guess urban myths... outbreak real. caused sure.   That's complete bullshit. spreading misinformation killing people. best scenario never knowing blood hands. Scenes NYPD chokes black man death vaccine card infect anti vaxers vaccine, obviously. Mask mandates exist many public spaces years come

I doubt much. become politically impossible vaccine mandates, given enough time. Vaccinated people already questioning mandate masks vaccine.

Not many places mandate masks now, cases drop, hard imagine drop mandates like last time. hear people complaining obligated tip takeout, look affirmation person service, three four bucks makes somebody's day better not?  glad alone thinking vaccine able achieve herd immunity. know people always disagree me. 

But really think lockdowns mask mandates help. 

I thought UK winner Chinese style localised lockdowns. totally seemed stop bothering them. Read syphilis studies black people 1970s. understand. *Fully tested vaccines*. Big caveat there. vaccine anti body test negative covid test would better idea. got vaccine first available, ain't shit likely. much risk unvaccinated. ethical, unfortunately sustainable. third world attain immunity wave hard way, infection :(  Giraffes thier part socially distance though. long-term solution?

Start treating like worse bad cold, vaccinated. Sure, getting cold sucks, worth upending life try avoid ever catching one. People normal times called germophobes, considered somewhat crazy.

The people refuse get vaccinated already point (thinking worse bad cold). going worse time covid rest us. made decision, live (or die) consequences. Also “forced” put mask subway far far cry “forced” internment camp something. people love freedom much aren’t driving 120 freeway? Would get work lot faster meaure household dirtyness tho air pollution pest nuisance. Boy truly illiterate expected antibodies wane? delta specific booster means memory cells delta proof? Well Florida record covid today. officials expect current surge cases get worse gets better say immunization key ending past 30 days, [county Supervisor] Fletcher said, people fully immunized accounted 92 percent new infections 98 percent hospitalizations. absolutely. Get fuck this, seriously. Logic? requirement safe effective vaccine pandemic disease, want talk logic.  They're testing limit. infections rising know. Get right back throat. I'm sure logic tracks. Bronxites delivery cost certainly eating in, even pricier. NYC delivery services like seamless grubhub, often low fee. Doordash Uber Eats may double food prices, regular delivery often tip delivery person small fee.

I'm saying problems here, I'm disagreeing particular train thought. setting aside vaccine hesitancy, easy get. real problem, wanted get it, bad low paying jobs awarding time workers get vaccine. mandate anything mandating sick PTO getting vaccine subsequent side effect sick days. reply wrong comment mistake, actually stupid?

I think people aren’t assholes… even ones keeping selfish IMO. need learn herd immunity smallpox polio vaccination completely changed world   indoor spaces (where risk transmission much higher) vaccinated people, risk infecting vaccinated people. same, risk infecting vaccinated people.

Vaccinated less likely get infected, **MUCH** less likely develop severe complications leading hospitalization.

We care much less infections vaccinated individuals long unvaccinated kept separate them. trick get long trench coat kid shoulders covering head coat.

Okay fuck? live heard damn thing this. That's grotesque. people walk grocery stores, Targets, Walmarts, etc. without restrictions.

Makes fucking sense lol.

Go big, enforce anything all. Agreed, want hospital staff overworked usual need ICU running capacity previously, i.e designed for. issue vaccine intended ensure R number could never stay 1. virus would unable spread communities. 

But several countries high vaccination rates seeing intended results. 

I know whenever call lockdowns face masks people shoot down. need something else vaccines return normality.  11 year old size many 14 year olds. Got first shot today. school starting many anecdotal cases similar large 11 year olds adverse reactions, we’re taking chances vaccine versus COVID. 

Not 8 year old.  condolences. got flu times kid and, start masking 2020, I've getting flu vaccine every year. 

It's one reasons hated flu comparisons, mean, flu vaccine good reason way people taking it.  Read Spanish flu. top Covid 2024. Freedom Freezers One assumption seems built someone equally contagious first 2-3 days they're stage register test. naive mental model would've contagiousness also lower incubation stage due lower viral load, I'm expert, anyone know answer there?

Well knowledge education keeping hospital systems overrun unvaccinated idiots.

You're asshole argues semantics like means point. know occurrence inflamed heart is? .0000008%

If people can't intelligent empathetic enough get vaccinated, us made suffer. one right threaten public safety they're stupid.

Governments totally good track record giving rights back.

LMAO  Naked strong word, hospitalizations protection much worse two doses Pfizer. Given longterm sequelae often suffered hospitalized, that's extremely important metric. objectively worse protected, personally feel safe single dose J&amp;J. Especially since mild infections still give long covid. talking lol? said anything dystopian nightmare. Thats little extreme  yet NYC walk Walmart, Target, Grocery store/ big box retail store policies local government put ""little guys"" exist.

What purpose exactly? 100% agree people record cops situation warrants it, situation screams inferiority complex. look words used describe him.  Assuming 2 doses gives effective rate 90%. means 100-(100/10) = 90%. means 2 doses reduces infections factor 10.

250% increase factor 3.5 since going 1 2 100% increase going 1 3 200% increase must mean going 1 3.5 250% increase

So factor 10 x 3.5 = 35

Applied first calculation,

100-(100/35) = 97.14% effective.

Imagine one trials early one patients treatment group contracted COVID-19. Could assume n 1 sample size means vaccines 0% effective? course not. That’s anecdotes aren’t useful statistics. Plus, believe data referring used “infection” benchmark rather “symptomatic infection”. There’s big difference one describing protection disease describes protection detectable virus. unvaccinated even step foot fast food/takeout restaurant NYC, coffee shop slice joint? one prevented going outside lol. think missing entering indoor business. also preventing anyone operating business without requiring it.

Try searches potential medical risks involved third dose - reading I’ve mostly found main objection moral, it’s right smart long run countries giving boosters many countries don’t access first doses yet. Again, idea I’ve formed reading, doesn’t seem much medical downside getting third dose. one thinks ""rushed"" trials. deliberately misrepresenting opposing viewpoint suit narrative. argument data sufficient conclude vaccines safe AAP argued FDA authorize vaccines kids ages 5 11 based initial trial data already available. Two months safety data also enough, 6-month follow-up significantly hinder ability reduce spread hyper infectious Covid-19 delta variant,"" letter said.

You disagree whether two months follow data enough, calling ""rushed"" misinformation. Hallelujah.

I curious hear people's experiences booster shot side effects effects compare Pfizer, Moderna, mixed Pfizer/Moderna regimens.

What J&amp;J people days? I’ve seen ton, know almost doctors get vaccinated, bet nurses 30-40% course do, looking forward. 

The MRNa research gone decades university labs, recent push forward r vaccines funded foundations people like Dolly Parton. course companies showed end saw money made. Damn publicfreakouts actualpublicfreakouts going popping show insurance info? opinion, answer question simple long-winded. Apologies advance. 

I try connect dots. US, unlimited amounts money may spent politicians elections, including dark money unknown sources. decades, wealthiest 1% used money sway politicians elections. also national media. US, perfectly acceptable media companies (owned 1%) use publicly owned airwaves lie spread propaganda. ultimate goal increase inequality much possible expense people. US effectively oligarchy wealthy control government, media economy. social safety nets. Public education US funded local property taxes. Therefore, child's zip code determines whether he/she go well-funded school school that's literally crumbling. US teachers notoriously underpaid. Wages US, terms buying power increased 40 years. College horrifically expensive put many people lifetime debt cannot removed bankruptcy. Health care for-profit system even health insurance, serious illness accident put medical debt. [18% Americans hold medical debt currently [2/3 Americans file bankruptcy say medical debt key cause (By way contrast, first world countries national health care even know medical bankruptcy is.)

Therefore, Americans increasingly oppressed impoverished wealthy largely unaware wealthy causing problem. 4 decades propaganda combined ever increasing levels ignorance thanks schools teach critical thinking, Americans believe propaganda problems due causes race, immigrants, liberals, conservatives, many guns, enough guns, lazy poor people, religious differences, older generations, you-name-it. 

So what's got masks? Well, we've got millions ignorant people never learned science school, much less public health science. never learned think critically means evaluating idea encounter. point view, science basically par religion therefore something choose believe not. Thus, someone's made conspiracy theory virus hoax deemed legitimate fact-based, tested, peer-reviewed science. Combine President Trump turning mask wearing political statement result millions people believe a) wearing mask getting vaccine stop hoax (eg non-existent) virus ridiculous b) wearing mask political statement shows support Trump. 

If US well educated population could recognize propaganda, jobs paid living wages, social safety nets prevent medical bankruptcies, debt-free college education, national media allowed lie laws prevent wealthy using wealth interfere democracy order transfer nation's wealth themselves, guarantee Americans would lot cooperative faced national emergency like current covid crisis.  Unfortunately, 6 weeks ago always falls memory hole. 14-17s study vaccinated not?

Arent top 3 states deaths per 100k new york new jersey Massachusetts ? Totally agree re: vaccines, restrictions, delta key things consider comparing current death rates rates time last year.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd like offer thoughts guesstimate active infection rates.

* Use info regarding average amount time people remained infected.
* Use info regarding many worst case deaths we've suffered.

&amp;#x200B;

If active infections 10%, folk remained infectious average 6 weeks, would've expected suffered 100% worst case deaths 1 year.

&amp;#x200B;

Instead, we've suffered 20% worst case deaths 16 months, average infection duration closer 3 weeks.

In 16 months (about **69 weeks**), we've hit **20% expected deaths**... so... 69 weeks divided 3 get 23 cycles, divide 20% 23 cycles, get **0.869% active infection rate**.

&amp;#x200B;

Glad hear complaints simplified analysis; IMO, nation, hovered around 1%, almost certainly never hit 5% actively infected across board, though localized outbreaks likely, briefly, exceeded 5% small amount. Oh don’t blame all. mind amazing service, got tons useful data early volunteers.

The question ask see headlines many covid cases unvaccinated versus vaccinated people? lockdowns

Almost EU country real lockdown since vaccination last months, that's beauty it. point measures living COVID, vaccination rates made reality, avoid disruptive measures like lockdowns. mask compliance even vaccinated

Due normalization well mandates, sense whiplash we've seen US restrictions there. Also, forgot mention much EU countries relied readily available testing vaccination mandates well.

 much people enjoyed piling Sweden last year, health minister Tegnell one people adamant COVID long-term issue public health mandates based around fact. Luckily, countries seem coming around idea, yet somehow people dying droves people starting ease enjoying life again. 

It seems like Americans holding onto idea COVID mitigation regular life need odds one another. feeds idea unless things like masks restrictions done away with, people enjoying lives, also stems idea masks symbol harshness restrictions often treated zero-sum invincibility shield. I've seen lot sentiment sub, especially vaccinated people starting return ""normal lives."" less attention paid swathes unvaccinated people still mixing freely unmasked vaccinated. Yet, somehow vaccinated people ones need reined punished? 

In Europe, exact opposite reality that, vaccinated person, able go eat bar beach vacation, one shame that. Why? earned COVID mitigation like physical distancing public masking deterrents enjoying simple pleasures life. Yet, US spent much time focusing masking/unmasking making overblown issue--especially considering attention shown anti-maskers media--instead focusing actually getting people vaccinated we're seeing result.  Oops, meant 12. Thanks!

Agreed, people still enjoy lives masks responsibility limiting often crowds. 

Sweden didn’t anything stop Covid mixed results. Many older population died. sure they’re delta.

Masking isn’t overblown issue. Vaccines gold standard take many weeks become effective we’re learning need renewed boosters. Masks - n95s - effective whole time instant. it’s clear people Covid, even vaccinated spread, community transmission also high makes sense masking happen. 

But crowded room US counties high transmission without wearing masks pretty high risk place individual community- matter activity (bar, church, etc). 

The tricky part actually responsible- parents sending kids school known Covid infections - that’s irresponsible. there’s bars churches tight spaces packed people wearing masks that’s also irresponsible high transmission areas.

Disclaimer: I'm judging people got mRNA booster addition J&amp;J. I'd rather shots get used expire. want emphasize people got J&amp;J worry unnecessarily data states well protected severe illness...and also want people shy away getting J&amp;J vaccine. Forget milkshakes. want cash incentives. volunteered order get shot 1 month later people getting paid. Blows mind still. 3rd shot going fuck much 2nd? Asking friend kids thing holding us back moving forward. get children vaccinated we're planning get back normal. say vaccines bad. saying setting goalposts bullshit. Keep vaccinating course also stop tracking reporting new cases kind meaningless vaccinated. reporting new hospital admissions. It’s enough Israelis considering full lockdown. matters hospital capacity. Yup. fully vaxxed since 1/12/21 I’m getting anxious booster available. comes Lamda. Go ahead vote me. Wait 3 months though please, we’ll see feel? Anything worry about? got two doses mass vax site run national guard neighboring state. Never gave insurance info. got third dose home state Walgreens, never gave insurance info. I'm close 6 months 2nd shot getting 3rd tomorrow. legit reason 3rd work unvaccinated people can't wait feel like shit again. Agreed that's it, make hurt less. Got keep pee pee pristine condition take package worth much.  keep reading news schools' mask mandates wonder something: send kids school masked, even mandate place? teachers go masked?

That way sensible parents could make difference even fool governor.

Here masks mandatory 6yo on, children using even 4 5 yo classes. Common sense need mandates. Hit Baskin Robbins free scoop. can't believe far scroll find comment. concerning everyone. think entered lotteries benefited matter early got vaccine. 

Still I’m bribing people get vaccinated like me, even I’m eligible, don’t give fuck long get shot. Damn, terrifyingly accurate analogy. Insane people blaming 12yr old spreaders… lol common wtf wrong people I’m vaccinated don’t think big conspiracy, stop? get third shot everyone reddit starts asking get fourth shot breakout happens? sub went “the vaccines amazing, anyone doesn’t get idiot” “two doses worthless, need another shot”. I’m sure I’ll get recommended FDA, doesn’t inspire confidence. article doesn’t mention vaccine uptake risk group typically severely ill covid. don’t numbers, imagine someone math, see efficacy still high vaccinated people delta. 

Also people infections getting level immunity, meaning gap efficacy vaccinated non-vaccinated people destined reduced point. aren’t superspreaders ffs.. common guys Love idea. 

Think we’ve established science common sense longer carry weight, yeah, let’s make competition. 

Oh vaxxed seating section gets free beer? Done! vaxxed town gets Springsteen concert? Sold!

Alright Texas, let's see daily blue alerts come these!  F. 15 year old daughter immune compromised meds RA never able finish doses MMR (she diagnosed 2).

Sadly pregnancy health condition comes Covid. happened..... It’s wild dude. isn’t antivax bs. gf got first dose, bad reaction, doctor recommending second dose, people foaming mouth. tv producer choosing put moron television program nothing ""freedom speech."" Second dose end April. ~4 months. know israeli data 6 months would prefer harder guarantee don’t get delta, particularly business/pleasure travel. doctor today daughters wellness check said keeps hearing around Christmas. :) happens loops around whole alphabet? understanding vaccinated prevent anyone contraction spreading virus. 

No. vaccines actually provide protection infection. That's hearing two numbers vaccine came out, efficacy hospitalization rates. Efficacy actual effectiveness contracting virus, that's varied vaccines. Alpha strain, 100% prevention hospitalization (which means even someone vaccinated infected, present severe enough symptoms require hospitalization). 

Besides, even breakthrough case (a vaccinated person contracts covid), viral load likely lower. they're going less likely spread virus degree someone else vaccinated contract it. spread among vaccinated lower spread among unvaccinated. 

Beyond that, really answered question. Even true, prevent issue hand, we're equally devoid strict masking social distancing measures ""freedom"" line frequently used (by politicians common person both) justify decision so. Weakness. little bit chills. Nausea. similar bad. came bit faster me. end... like flu reading redditor's comment weeks ago. said (unverified) phase 3 trials 2 boosters since part ongoing study.

There broad consensus among arts organizations — well others city-owned — favor vaccination mandate.

“Everyone wants audiences employees safe,” said Lucy Sexton, executive director New Yorkers Culture &amp; Arts, advocacy group. Ms. Sexton — together Taryn Sacramone, executive director Queens Theater — last year started daily Zoom call 200 arts leaders pool support information pandemic.

RIP would believe it, Ontario Canada history patients treated hallways ER full well (before Covid) years ago city amongst worst province ER wait times.   never meant act proof vaccination though.  People provide sources BEST kind people! actual vaccine itself? Weve told weeks away getting FDA approval nothing else. hell going happen? Reddit social media designed make hopeless others isolate keep working paying taxes. seeing worst humanity time spend here. Don’t let win, don’t deserve angry strangers time even *feels good* happening. think would already seen it. [here great study NIH.  always need wear helmet. Nothing perfect.  optional, can't called mandate anymore.  Youre child pointless carry on. love song much Weird Al fan disconcerting see many people take life death level!

I’m still mad though wanting punish people selfish choices helps takes edge bit. Nothing change decide change behavior. I’ve done socially responsible duty, tired dealing shit refuse part. Hard empathy anymore many obvious solutions problem exist. Yikes That's great. focus needs getting vaccine 5-12 year olds. Apparently hospitalizations decreasing there, maybe. must inherently believe right harm others; proper mask wearing takes away feel 'rights' violated. 

It's explanation think of. type reply would like ask state/municipal area live FDA lot leeway like expediting EUA.

they disregarded science approved Alzheimer drug recently. I’m suggesting COVID Bring King? helps, try remember mutations \*bad\* us. may mutate something much less threatening. standpoint ""what natural selection would 'best' virus?"", virus super high fatality rate also means lot less time spread. dead host host pass along. Obviously virus mind decide mutate, stands reason mild high transmission rate virus would beat super deadly one milder version time hang spread. didn't. One likely explanation posted someone else lots people outside SP vaccinated SP counted SP stats. shot far painless one remember ever getting. know it. prepared fatigue/arm soreness, you’ll fine. Good getting shot! got this.  since mild infections still give long covid.

That's biggest worry, gotten J&amp;J. There's also telling 80 yr old father, got Pfizer, could number still seem vulnerable.

The word ""naked"" might strong objectively, that's good description feels. \~30% chance hospitalization certainly weighs. agree. trying encouraging people give masking least ages vaccinated. Considering mask compliance among police many places stuff like flat refuse job enforce masking don’t think make case caring hate. callous disregard safety communities charged protecting also hate? No, would ridiculous. simply don’t care people around them, don’t care them. Pediatrcians society already told data good enough hurry up. Agreed Im happy vote change next election! longer favor restrictions. it’s probably coincidence seem Pfizer breakthrough cases. understanding data supports that. fact, Pfizer vaccine (30 mg) one-third dose Moderna (100 mg), reason difference breakthrough infections. *cries Team Pfizer*

Like said, it’s many people bums feel way. I'm flashbacks... Oh I'm remembering last year know impossible it. become better hotspot?! Fuck yeah! Wearing mask =/= upending life

Why Americans think like this? That's probably even person implying focusing masking (I'm looking you, CDC, rushed mandate changes) partially we're mess. plenty countries, restaurants, bars, clubs, movie theatres, theme parks, open stop anyone masking. Wearing mask go friends mean need hold anything. going ask same… Tell look career instructional design / corporate learning &amp; development. Funny, lot countries need underpay workforce fine.

Saying ""well least people jobs, I'm totally fine companies underpaying workers!"" ridiculous shit imaginable, billionaires thank profusely continuing perpetuate nonsense.

I’m showing arguments we’re used attempt deny medical coverage smokers, obese, diabetic II, pregnancy, list goes on. 

It’s tired argument doesn’t move opinions. worries! wanted point vaccines potential make us feel sick, regardless type.

Any type vaccine, including Live Attenuated, Viral Vector, mRNA, Inactivated, Subunit, etc... designed trigger immune response. response makes us feel sick. hits hard people, completely unnoticed others.

If vaccine makes feel crummy, know that's good sign... means immune system creating required memory cells antibodies.

If feel anything vaccination, bad sign either. might well-balanced immune system.

\*It's damaging teach kids fear  Within EU, citizens need test re-enter country enter another EU country fully vaccinated (second shot least two weeks prior travel). livelihoods fine open pretty much 18 months. Don’t use shitty covid experience argue NZs approach guess government pay boosters. Even so, “expensive” Pfizer Moderna shots $30-ish.  ya, everyone gets vaccinated. solution. done yet, really give try. someone tell media clearly reporting US daily deaths?  real story here? dead people?

Downvoted truth, way CDC acting simply isn’t insane logical extrapolation. Sure. average age highest overdoses deaths 35-44. means way young people dying drugs. leaving behind younger children covid. one considering 50 year old orphan lost parents. That’s getting at. wonder rollout like. going go dose date status? someone fortunate get shot cohort fully authorized, I’m wondering I’ll eligible booster. Eh, NSW ass handed they're *still* half-assing measures. taken weeks arrive measures states implement right bat.  know next nothing vaccine requirements cops/corrections always assumed similar hospital workers EMTs, etc. Since interact public much thought would need vaccinations. mean, would think risk needle sticks alone (when conducting searches) would make ya want Hep B series Tdap.

Does anyone know? common police officers required up-to-date vaccines? Australia messed betting much AZ home grown vaccine failed. NZ waited see vaccine best purchasing (Pfizer) result got orders months countries big outbreaks could afford wait see. made purchase order March, delivery come July. vaccinating 50,000 people day finish whole adult populace December. step sister got covid February wasn’t bad enough go hospital. got vaccinated April got delta variant week ago. said she’s feeling worse February going decide today husband needs bring hospital.

Actual COVID burned time off, day vaccinated unpaid. um wtf test positive vacation (fully vaccinated) first week March, 2020. went lockdown?

I go office old job August last year. get special permission 

All calendars people’s desks still March 13th. bizarre cause vaccine requirement new restaurants mean abnormal. I've said elsewhere private schools required confirm students date vaccinations restaurants required enforce ""no shirt shoes service"". tweet 10 days old.

Virtually every medical organization still favor reopening schools today (and also favor last year). look journals see done risk/reward calculations isn’t close.

School *really, really important* closing [real immunity severe disease 30% people one Texas largest cities still lot people.  provided scientific basis decision yet I'm speculating, guess logic goes something like this: 


We know vaccination ""only"" reduces spread something like [70% vaccinated Alpha, Delta, data yet), even [reduces chances infection Given many ""Delta"" infections there, non-trivial amount Covid spread vaccinated individuals currently. Early data seems support 3rd booster increasing antibody response even 2nd dose, would make sense try tamp spread groups.  


It would seem since can't really export vaccines developing world (logistics challenges mRNA vaccines / cold storage) pfizer / Moderna producing vaccines useful there, might well let make help curb current wave sooner later. whole seems like bigger deal epidemiologically 'personal protection' basis. risk getting sick hospitalized might go percentage points, whole, groups vaccinated people places higher vaccination rates might able move needle significantly closer herd immunity strategy.  


That's guess, could completely base. Don’t ✍️ get ✍️ moderna ✍️   Tennessee absolutely fucked state. Hey hey welcome club! brother literally told “trying superspreader.” He’s always like that. It’s idiotic, everyone around him.

So much unnecessary disease death.  accomplishment? Lol, country fucked. far surpasses amount children typically lose even worst flu seasons, that's flu shot available perfect basically guarantee pediatric death.    No, NZ even developed plans purchase booster doses anyone initial rollout. Personally consider major concern may delay re-opening another year.  open mind bad thing?

You said going venue right. wrong. Say government says everybody go venue unless black, Jewish, Muslim, Christian, homosexual, cold, cancer, etc. That's wrong right go venue choose. understand covid, race, sexual orientation I'm using example since seem understand right is.

Now changed argument going private venue. That's different. private venue says can't come vaccinated wearing mask 100% right. that. respected

But government tells can't based medical decision different. violating constitutional rights. Allowing government violate rights treading extremely dangerous waters we've seen time time history  He's Vietnam veteran. took vaccine, merely asked people resisting there.  Totally agree lock people HIV sex. J&amp;J well. would like see find would wait J&amp;J publish data getting booster Moderna Pfizer No, yearly vaccinations enter restaurants gyms new. assume would concern government won’t perpetually flip bill vaccines (1, 2-10 years road). 

Flu shots always free I’d expect annual COVID shots get that. economic cost letting COVID run rampant higher paying vaccinations. Public schools different *literally every facet public society*. 

I also believe everybody get vaccinated, want that. covid year ago I'm vaccinated. know much covid sucks, responsible thing got vaccinated... type legislation however makes deeply uncomfortable. 

Not way fully articulate yet, know I'm okay quickly people jumped board this. sore arm me, nothing else. 

I say based data studies recently read, mom decided go get Moderna previous shots Pfizer sick hell like 3 days.  🤷 b.o.t.s. always smart sometimes downright d. u. m. b. a. s.  information hospitalization vaccination status age? jurisdiction whole life, much wish was, shocked.

Nobody likes lockdown/mask shit, moment give valid excuse, they'll stop. hardcore holdouts traumatized let go masks become small minority, oddity fringes, nothing more. mutation drops efficacy vaccine suddenly zero unbelievably unlikely. efficacy likely slowly eroded, able boost.

Yes vaccines keep people serious side effects, still caught transmitted. Spring, hope vaccines coming combating (and did), Delta seems like something that's going linger.

if not, why?  news us one shot J&amp;J folks? try worried since data I've read suggests J&amp;J fine Delta, seems pretty lame treated second class citizens. I...just become Falcons fan?? Unfortunately, think combinations studied (think many combinations :). 

Given vaccine side-effects small, think many people experiment :) curiosity, strong argument going getting third shot right now? got J&amp;J, sore arm mildly achy day it. called work going working outside day didn’t feel like physical labor absolutely could’ve worked desk shift.

On hand, 4 months COVID infection probably influenced immune response. would. that’s me. live large Florida city virus control. message state government clear. own, state making every effort allow virus spread unchecked. Businesses allowed enforce vaccination employers customers schools allowed mandate masks. hospitals stopped elective surgeries (as anyone wait cancer cut out), long waits emergency beds.

Am supposed allow vulnerable covid federal government wants single policy whole country? Even facts ground different region region? nuance?

As said, situation may look completely different. me, it’s absolute brainer get booster people depend me. I'm hoping people reluctantly got vaccine least reflect fact nothing happens get shot. feel shitty next day that's it. lose soul, start hearing voices, start howling moon. Nothing happens; immune system goes haywire 48 hours that's it. point isn’t working even plenty supply.

What’s saying deadlier variant isn’t created defense vaccine? Probably help keep hospitalizations deaths down. You’re entitled whatever opinion have, doesn’t mean it’s valid. heard anyone's sense taste f'd second shot? 4 months tongue still feels like someone holding weak 9V battery it?  I’ve already attempted sign Moderna trial. willing take different state lie age get vaccinated (which said to—apparently reinforcing honesty kids came back bite me.) Thanks. sure hope see something change soon. Sure works spike, vast majority cases. care Google you’ll find lot science studies showing effective vaccines actually are.

Has fear really broken people badly? Sorry mistake. Yep, expect hope success had. I'm sorry financial situation. say actually happened coworkers, imagine win lawsuit. 

You'll forgive I'm skeptical, story seems really fishy. work government agency also mandated vaccine (Education Service District), know least two coworkers able get medical exemptions difficulty. one coworker tried get ""exemption"" naturopath sign something, obviously rejected. type agency wife work for? type doctor signed it? also exempt childhood vaccinations? ask last one everything COVID-19 vaccine potential allergen also present common vaccinations.

Fuck. can't country both? Clearly abundance vaccines going waste. we're already donating helping countries out.

I assume logistics producing enough vaccines world largely figured out. main issue seems giving people country needs figure vaccine ready. too. like school district going way infect kids. keep sending us ""Updated Covid Guidelines"" even following.

Why defensive? Singapore reported 44 COVID-19 deaths since outbreak started early January 2020. compares 800 flu-related deaths typical year, according doctors, country population 5.7 million.    thought first world countries vaccine supply far exceeding demand?

True, time reason NZ Aus slow vaccination efforts relatively normal covid-free lives lived date. countries simply needed more. agree faster vaccine rollout would much preferable (and there’s strong argument it’s failure government), fact majority population remains unvaccinated, current situation they’re best-practice approach.

As someone lives Western Australia, locked times 1 case, assure 2 weeks takes spread effectively stopped. contact tracing systems relatively efficient ensure contacts made isolate ASAP. couple 3-to-5-day lockdowns, followed week “easing restrictions” including wearing masks, life returns normal. 

I’m saying happen situation — NZ may lucky. However, fewest ICU beds OECD, majority population unvaccinated, delta variant outbreak might ravage island. lockdown right call now. Considering difficult find somewhere actually J&amp;J stock, im sure even matters.

Btw want talk something seemingly literally one talking - experimental antiviral called 'DRACO'. antiviral I've heard protect literally viruses around. I've heard tested flu, common cold, dengue. definitely work covid.

 unlike antibodies works instead gets soaked bodies cells waits inside cell detects whether virus enters cell rewires part virus cause cell immediately self destruct.

-instead cell look virus produce viruses - cell instead looking virus see's special 'self destruct' code immediately die. 

So actually could really good combination regular antibodies - vaccine. Antibodies first line defense chance virus make DRACO case last line defense.

Makes people seem kind petty, complaining missing little money merchandise. sayin. there’s serious medical reason can’t wear mask, usually it’s lung related, people public they’ve major co-morbidities catch covid. Places like Wholefoods Target would recommend get deliveries curbside pickup come stores military prevent this. TN already bringing national guard prevent collapse.  Florida changed COVID reporting method Tuesday reports cases deaths actually occurred rather communicated state — allowing health officials assign cases deaths days past rather Health officials adjusted recent information revised numbers going back start pandemic March 2020. Since Tuesday, Florida continued revise information based actual dates cases deaths, even adjusting record-breaking daily case counts downward.

Edited.  Honestly think point get everyone get severely ill, die, lesser chance long haul COVID. 

The opportunity reach heard immunity gone unless new vaccine stop spread people vaccinated. 

In one sense think ""every man himself"" stage unfortunate, government vested interest pushing too. want best dying preventable diseases. Losing skilled workers beneficial economy family unit. Funny regret fact trust science ended hospitals. still millions spilling lies daily I'm sure they'll regret died.

I ran sympathy regrets. wonder well. valved ones much comfortable wearing/speaking longer periods time. doesn’t I’ll eat shoe part cant get past matter what, vaccine greatly cuts back chances give someone else.

Also, think applies Drs private practice, hospital setting.
Whether doctor shouldn’t choice poses interesting question. Boosters something feel grateful for. got second Feb pregnant I’ve pretty concerned much immunity time I’m due. I’m also worried dad vaccinated Pfizer March also adamant longer masking might screwed breakthrough infection due age comorbidities. We're going back remote learning, we? likelihood getting blood clot AZ vaccine [1 likelihood getting life-threatening blood clot catching Covid [39 1 25,461.

250,000 / 25,461 = 9.82. So, ten times likely get one blood clots Covid infection AZ vax.

There's certain threshold likelihood ""warning people potential issues"" actually becomes counterproductive. Scaring people getting shots puts risk, full stop. Considering test positivity rate 14%, testing enough data reliable. single school district yesterday. 399 kids confirmed infected. first day last Tuesday. *Could be* situation acknowledged nearly every world government medical professional damn planet MIGHT ACTUALLY EXIST timeline could use some, ahem, pruning talking about? Doctors don’t union salaries haven’t kept inflation years due healthcare administration undercutting us everywhere can. enough vaccines recommend booster shots share countries.  They’ll likely recommended people 8 months elapsed since second shot next days. isn’t clear yet eight months came whether getting sooner might effect strength immune response. they’re testing 100k day. would need email school board superintendent? [He’s openly defying governor ordering mask feds backing up.

My mayor reinstated mask mandate county buildings month ago, also defiance governor. *are* leaders Florida trying lead. sure mean vaccine escape. 

But soo far almost everyone able vaccinated got shot. 99.5% available vaccine used. Meanwhile south contemplate people cough other’s mouths. hate, mocking refractory troglodytes yourself. ICU physician here. Planning transition health tech next year. Good question . course one could immediately argue long term risks COVID far worse. immediate risk getting disease progressing rapidly ( vaccine introduces spike protein get COVID body least recognizes knows ) 
Point , can’t know certain it’s weighing risks -what risk comfortable taking ? 
That said , example , virology students covid dissertations entire departments devoted science it, world wide caught attention , become main focus research novices experts alike . much data vaccine ( people aren’t ignoring long term complications ..we making vaccines generations existing data ) 
The overwhelming response take vaccine. It’s hard imagine mostly everyone wrong. Sure everyone jumps bridge … case 90% people jump what’s bridge may considered far worse plight ) It’s smart question everything , it’s understandable, make informed decision 100% agreed

100% happen Exactly. frightened COVID impact kids anyone. people, virtual learning possible parents older kids, families one parent earns much parent work. hope doctors follow example. comes it, care offered first children young vaccinated (or individuals *legitimately* get vaccinated due allergies medical condition) vaccinated breakthrough cases.

I mean, point, fuck people *could* vaccinated, chose to.  resouces exist treat them, obviously should, choices need made treat, choice clear. touching bed yell dibs? Well, keeps showing media asking rich countries donate jabs instead applying third doses stuff. read 12.9 bi jabs donated world total, see articles talking doses received countries. they're donating much, hope goes well guys wish best. That’s true. thinking school sanctioned sports.

I don’t know man. Seems cruel tel kid can’t see friends go school sports whatever, especially 2020. flip side is, kinda cruel get sick get others sick.

When northern states move inside weather cools respiratory illness season hits (flu, colds, covid once!) kids remain school unvaccinated, whole lot places U.S. going look like Louisiana, Florida, etc.

This chance power foresight. Insanity. 

Currently trying get in-laws get vaccinated. 

They aren’t stupid, they’ve overrun conspiracies think “it’s murky!”

I swear [Poe's working overtime last couple years. enough vaccines recommend booster shots share countries.  waste doses everyday. gave us green light months ago Doctors pretty finite amount patients accept often long waiting lists stands. 

96% doctors U.S. vaccinated, I'd say odds enough physicians cover anti-vaxxers extremely low. flows heavy, no. Maybe could between, say, Western Northern Australia. Italy Switzerland Germany Netherlands. would pretty much bring entire European industry halt time, somewhere along way would fail anyway. mean, freaking Australia failed multiple times, *the* standard isolated country.

Besides, goods. Cross border workers exist, vital keep essential services running many regions. Especially EU countries pretty much borderless nowadays. general public doesn’t know deal people anymore. live WA ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯. People freaked Delta seems stay away tuna  hearing year now. Booster shots every 8 months sounds like becoming flu-like situation, get one every year order get covid again. reading wrong? someone got hit covid pretty hard really dont want get again. Yeah...... no...  WAIT. governments way making less immunocompromised people wait vaccinate immunocromopised first? like mask shortage said “dont need wear mask” stockpile hospital. Cause thats case might well trust govnt go get third dose. 

Please Advise. Ill also contact doctor.  Good question--we know years vaccine development (more 100 years, actually!) see potential side effects occur soon vaccination. potential side effects result immune response happens soon vaccination, see new effects many years months later. vaccine ""active ingredient"" speak enters body, immune system recognizes learns (just happens throughout dailiy course life) active ingredient broken gone. Cases general increasing, kids. mine CVS (I immunosuppressive drug) similar first two doses. Quick easy. Hanging minutes safety. dont trust science vaccine, trust science hospital save you? Let people need hospital rooms them, thought covid fake die home. look worldometer numbers, daily deaths Florida seem gone since 6th despite number cases going explanation is?  blood you! Two weeks! think realize that. plan open slowly starting early next year population vaccinated people better protected.   Weird, encouraged go get different vaccine wanted double blind way know actually protected Unfortunately choice, imo.....Doctors obligated treat everyone, think people unvaccinated choice terrible people, deserve medical care like undocumented LGBT people enemies battlefield.....I dont see Dr refusing treat unvaccinated differently see Dr refusing treat Gay person.

That's good imo Get antibody test urgent care, might pay pocket Concerning levels Florida According covidactnow, Missouri infection rate .99, essentially meaning state downtrend cases. valve unnecessary expense. sourced weird duckbill ones Kimberly Clark's official Amazon store (Kimberly Clark linked it.) $60 50. saying 1 500 3 days single day. absolutely bet ass lmao can't authority new rule

Why not? job ensure restaurants follow health rules. health rule. different making sure bathroom ""staff must wash hands"" sign. name spelled incorrectly   Slow spread. what? Drag years? phase 1 back August last year first injection year ago. Second one 21 days later symptoms (fever, chills). third injection February also symptoms, wasn’t originally triple vaccinated group figured reacting placebo. called Pfizer became available said unblinded scrap data, offered let get Pfizer stay blinded. Thinking may given placebo went Pfizer. March. unblinded last week learn I’ve received 3 Novavax doses 2 Pfizer doses Fuck that, 2nd shot ruined life. Everything used love eating tastes like shit. getting another dose. question valid.

First, bad news. cannot completely prove long term effects impossible anytime soon. way wait many years monitoring trial participants observe nothing bad, doing.

But lots evidence tells us long term effects extremely unlikely.

No vaccine ever effects showed weeks administration, there's reason vaccine would different.

Nothing vaccine remains body days, antibodies immune cells body made itself, like routine infection. Exactly! succion, O2, call bell, cardiac monitor hallway spots. Unless you’re 100% walkie-talkie you’re fucked  Huge risk incubation spreading. reached herd immunity getting 80-90% EVERYONE vaccinated. can’t attest sure. I’m legit tired parents telling great virtual kids. contacted site advice me. Said novavax intending offer boosters, said call back decide drop out. went ahead made Moderna appointment 🤷‍♀️ believe ""essential workers"" simply wear mask return work dumb sounds.  drive nearly 2 hours find available place get vaccine last spring....it ridiculous Concerning levels also detected Florida humans. Yelling crowd without mask guaranteed spread event.  doctor advised getting one shots CDC made recommendations. sure do. post multiple links address concerns. additional questions, ask here, post, message want! kind like good american Doctor would look like, tbh. Idk mean anything you. vaccines effective reducing spread reduce chances infection. However, 40% population still unvaccinated, there's lot opportunity spread vaccinated people therefore, breakthrough cases. yep, approach needs applied everywhere possible. even covid pediatrician said refuse families don’t vaccinate kids (aside medical reasons). paraphrasing: said parents aren’t willing listen doctors science vaccines, point trying ensure child well taken care event sickness, matter mild especially severe. 

hopefully approve vaccines kids… it’s unfortunate kids ones highest risk right thanks antivax anti mask idiots. ...have asked doctor instead random internet strangers? You’re still 80% less likely catch vaccination, little less you’ve infected. It’s going run naive immune systems soon, Delta spreading fast makes happen faster. Yeah, I'm aware. point comment possible, ""These numbers awful, there's possibility ever anything preventable act collective self-harm"". Here's hoping fool catches covid again.

Just following single professional's judgment sometimes crazy. One thing I've learned sure - doctors geninuses.

Now comes something ALL, internationally agree like vaccines. Well, shit. That's obvious. Get vaccines. 

For reference know they're geniuses - due someone accounting deciding worth making anymore - dog get lyme vaccine can't.

Here’s former head FDA children really greater risk due mutations

I think one unequivocally yes comparing Delta Alpha based reporting we've seen thus far. Alpha seemed cause low incidence infection young people, seems changed Delta seeing significantly reports childhood infection, serious illness death previous waves. personally think higher viral loads delta likely culprit, leading infected children lead worse outcomes increase potential population hospitalization death. could tape valve closed (I assume, bought one exactly shove tape). valve masks like 95% much surface area, closing valve gonna let work pretty much well valveless one. mention got shot also get $100 not.

I've fired quite patients, usually lying attempt obtain narcotics Hippocratic Oath eclipsed document professional ethics extensive, regularly updated ethical codes issued national medical associations, AMA Code Medical Ethics (first adopted 1847), British General Medical Council's Good Medical Practice case. Tampa opened 2 testing sites. completely slammed today. Hillsborough County (county 5,600 quarantined kids are) opened least 1 new site well. 

Anecdotally know ton people recently, currently, sick Covid. everywhere right city assume Tampa unique state. Vaccine trial data collection extended pre-delta outbreak kids weren’t major risk, data better. Things changed now. specific countries? cut part spreading amongst kids infecting unvaccinated parents. OP paranoid quote would indicate. used similar language also added sees children infants also immunocompromised kids, categories children cannot vaccinated still risk even so.

Therefore, accept children vaccinated due parent choice medical reasons. breaks heart, wants patients, cannot risk coming preventable disease infecting at-risk children waiting room passed hallway. saw coming. point know several people already got third dose. dispute public health officials spent past couple months insisting boosters won’t needed. mixed messaging ridiculous it’s like parent lieing child justifying saying “it’s protecting them”.  We’ve data showing would needed time, countries already recommending them. counter productive health officials beating away “boosters won’t needed” drum face much evidence say need them. frustrating. I’m due booster Oct then. Hopefully get soon can. I’m lunch lady county definitely tell us can’t make kids wear mask even though governor mandated them. I’m terrified. I'm sure agree. intended effect stimulate immune system mount defense. Sometimes causes fever, chills, etc. sometimes doesn't.

The fever, chills, etc. intended effect, they're side-effects. intended, referred ""adverse events.""  want extra day sick time work. Vaccine wiped Yup. pediatrician limp Polio. relishes talking anti-vax people want patient.

I thought prevented COVID? Someone correct I’m wrong. haven’t seen data says spread vaccine. 

Yhall mad people getting can’t see perspective. told someone one would likely say “Well can’t still catch vaccinated?” like way hospital reacted statement, Summa hospital spokesperson said, “We understand varying feelings COVID vaccine respect right people peacefully share perspective. Ultimately, COVID vaccination policy based science supports mission promise healthcare organization care community. policy remains place.” adventure struggling breathe! Congrats! enough data say.  course would. emergency rooms like today, ventilators etc. saw happened India hospitals overcrowded, ran oxygen COVID patients sent home get better. Maybe 25% treating COVID patients survive misleading headline.

The doctor ending relationship existing patients vaccinated oct 1, 2021. (And probably accepting new patients vaccinated)

The headline makes sound like he's process treating them, sees info walks away. city (Tampa) opened 2 new testing sites week. They're advising people patient sites overrun. know cities counties also reopening test sites result increased spread.

The 'plateau' people talking likely maxed testing. new sites around state start testing people, see worse case numbers coming. West’s close friends became ill virus, third died. Rattled stressed, prayed guidance. Then, mother another relative urged get vaccinated, took sign God. West drove Winn Dixie supermarket rolled sleeve first two injections Moderna vaccine.

Any sane logical person would list cause death Cancer. Anyone/Anyplace lists cause death situation Covid spreading false information. 


That's I'm asking for. that's issue, bad people deny claims. 5% clot, get it. 8 weeks minimum UK. It’d lot convenient, that’s sure. mean, ever tracked vaccine brands they’ve before? know couldn’t tell brand flu pneumonia vax had. Plus, far tell studies done, evidence far isn’t safe, it’s unlikely *less* effective. 

I also suspect “recommended” won’t happens real world mRNA vaccines full approval. Doctors prescribe label time. Reddit follow example. :) problem Wow.

I’ve Indonesia yeah it’s poorer country don’t “live literal fucking trash” even that’s death sentence you? born it’s expected children die preventable disease? 

Yes low chance death COVID really gonna take risk eating random skittle know 2 pack poisoned?

I’m happy got first bout COVID easily, hopefully fare well infected different variant. they're reacting exactly deadly pandemic, wtf wealthy countries doing? family members die they're vaccinated. least chance extremely extremely low Good. common sense. bad grounds license termination.

That doctor business seeing patients. We‘ll know following vaccinated people time, like first two doses. New virus, new disease, new vaccine— we‘re leaning go. Likely last longer initial series though Pfizer says third dose results 5-10x antibody production second dose. sure scientists talking adjusting vaccine variants taking 100 days so. 

But ok, never better every scientist come said it’s almost near certainty virus mutate evade existing vaccines. talking ""breakthrough cases resulting hospitalization"" I'd say uncommon inaccurate. Ultra-rare would accurate. However, say title implies cases general misleading. booster helps protect covid symptoms (which seems to) cares others. Yes idea world get everyone vaccinated wipe covid live post truth 9/11 hyperpartisan world.

If others get least keep safe, especially long covid.

We going get covid point now, may well protected possible.

God damn antivax people fucking stupid  Wild hung definition word? definition word change reality situation. That's idiotic. Recently?? Every doctor Ontario Canada mask mandate since March 2020.. already everything supposed do. I'm vaccinated wear mask. there's still going assholes refuse wear mask get vaccinated (or fake cards apparently) type events spread shit every go. vaccinated mean immune covid 19, less likely die it. still get it, symptoms spread everyone know. Aren’t Tdap days (tetanus, dyptheria, pertussis…. don’t know stands something). didn’t even know could get tetanus alone. got Tdap plus MMR booster work son’s school. Fair warning, Tdap feels like got punched arm like week. Tdap soreness worse Covid shot soreness. Vaccines provide 100% immunity, difference vaccine treatment. difference vaccine given healthy people (before infection) treatments given sick people (after infection). Meanwhile, vaccines use today flu vaccine significantly worse vaccines without booster.

So regards personal protection, vaccine still works booster serve top make getting sick less likely, change small chance hospitalization death even smaller chance. Plenty people like gladly take shot increase already good protection vaccines.

There's another aspect though trickier: herd immunity communal protection. Ideally, vaccines decrease spread well protect vaccinated individuals. Communal protection drives case numbers, protects vaccinated unvaccinated. Note vaccines this, ideal do. Unfortunately, recent data, seems like current vaccines well Delta. leads vaccinated people alter behavior, even though may low risk, may interacting people higher risk unvaccinated children vaccinated elderly people breakthrough risk significant. hope boosters increase individual protection, decrease spread well.

I work sports official side job, winter swimming sport officiate. know swimming everyone indoors natatoriums sometimes don’t even good circulation.

If either Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine need 1 single shot either?

Is easy going local ""insert vaccine place here"" saying would like vax asked say vax-ed prior? looking debate morality this.

But every year still better actually getting sick. Fellow novavaxer. approval thing dumb. work vaccine requirement accepts ""who approved"" vaccines. online system accept novavax entry, accepts sinovac. point I'm counting approval India. high hopes. Sadly true. results integer overflow, resetting protection 0%. got vaccine received, free charge, protection Covid. pretty good deal. 🤷‍♂️ Look tell pandemic main cause Labour's victory. growth cases slowing perhaps even plateauing.  Yep. NZ able keep strict health measures eternity. everyone vaccinated border rules eased vaccinated people continue bring covid in. going keep quarantine hotels eternity? Yep. fully vaccinated February. least 8 months gives till October. No, it’s really bad point many reasons: expiring logistically couldn’t get immuno compromised groups US enough expiring doses even give elderly third shot.

It’s really bad, irrelevant point. Personal decision, based risk profile: age, medical profile upcoming travel ""red"" regions world, certifiably access vaccines many months come + one researches coming Imperial College London concerning actual effect time vaccines.

We first bring back mask mandate. I’ve seen _some_ noncompliance outskirts Clark county Vegas seems alright considering tourism industry put us risk. statement making, vaccines make big deal specific period time, readily disproven science. hospitalization numbers skew overwhelmingly towards unvaccinated.

Are *some* vaccinated people going hospital? Yeah. effective antiviral drug, would *some* people work on? Also yes. 

The law large numbers dictates people still get COVID bad case. never guaranteed way fix 100% population. 

But vaccines good well get. Getting sniffles big deal. Even getting flu like symptoms big deal. *Most*, like 99% breakthrough cases, more, end person hospital. even greater number end person alive.

Well, guidelines last year, makes sense infectious delta would change guidelines well.  are? moron? thanks info. pretty much decimates lame excuses them. What.

I'm thrilled working field. am, however human sciences career glad direct interaction clients. But, good risk exposure them, family. Staying real hydrated general good idea. 

I thought read somewhere half Americans fact, chronically dehydrated. enough serious health concern, need water intake. 

/r/hydrohomies I’m pretty sure holding “approval” crowd full shit. They’re conspiracy theorists. approval done, they’ll move goalposts start harping something done incorrectly, suspiciously, uniquely FDA’s process. it’ll unsafe that.

Edit - point being, someone saying “I’m holding approval” now, don’t genuinely plan get shot using current excuse. resources need allocated give countries infrastructure. longer world goes without sort protection, likely variant arises resistant vaccines. elderly parents live talked father last night, naturally age he's terrified everything happening around him. observation end day about.......""freedom"". 

The virus real (to some) vaccine work (for most), end day........damnit.....you're gonna infringe people's personal freedoms. Tennessee mostly population people screaming freedoms, liberty, etc. look video last week crazies threatening school board. 

Fun fact: graduated secondary school class song ""Free Bird"" Lynyrd Skynryd. still die car accident even wearing seatbelt… top 10 visited cities foreigners, top 10 populous (total density)... well known US mardi gras, Saints, Katrina, well known city think is.

There's ""coastal media bias"" play here, New York passed first, reported way. believe FDA wanted trials approval delayed process You’re talking New Zealanders voted draconian leaders like one? one matter much align decision would known elected leader would choose even known situation would’ve happened. wouldn’t blame voters much leader elected Thanks update, Welland Tribune. Hard hitting journalism. New Zealand spent pandemic actually functioning normal, including holding large, unmasked sporting events without risk illness.

Furthermore, cases low mitigate impact contact tracing succeeded stopping larger outbreaks. quarantines also typically targeted localized. problem case suggests possible community spread, cases found.

They also vaccinating people New Zealand, meaning  much population suffer worst effects covid go entire pandemic without knowing single person New Zealand suffered ill effects died. Ok thanks responding. Maybe I’ve reading many coronavirus comments they’re starting run together…. Well yea. bet young people died form drugs. Leaving behind young children orphans. covid USA.

This dumbest logic. Kids get sick spread virus easily. Guess spreading to? Adults.

Why letting politicians make medicals decisions? person lives Tennessee, collectively suck. one wears masks, everyone hitting bars night. restrictions mandates anywhere. Gov Bill Lee passed order saying parents opt kids school mask mandates (similar vaccine exemption) also work hospital Knoxville. Let tell you, 18-20+ hour waits seen UTMC similar waits FSRMC. hospital system already breaking down. hazard pay nurses, doctors salaries already halved earlier pandemic. 

TLDR: fucked. schools TN aren’t requiring masks begin with. One counties tried implement policy, I’m 100% serious…. move students different seats every 14 minutes. it’d break 15 minute close contact/6ft rule requires contact tracing kid tests positive. direction school board teacher training start school year, random teacher thinking they’re clever.  worst thing Tamiflu early take effective.

What shit. Anyhow, experience need exaggerate I'm taken seriously. struggle convey issues way doctors care, even I'm awful pain. Yeah 100% this. blindly trust random doctors, get second opinions (and third).

Get 100 opinions vaccines, they'll say thing. 15 August, 514 Israelis hospitalized severe critical COVID-19, 31% increase 4 days earlier. 514, 59% fully vaccinated. Dont. Im one expecting extra payment job Im already getting paid do. Unvaccinated people discharged vaxxed person comes in. difference two vaccinated people much lower chance transmitting virus much less severe symptoms contract it. 

I vaccinated, still got covid recently. Instead becoming seriously ill potentially hospitalized, little tired days. 

Is possible could still outcome unvaccinated? Yes. 

Is compelling reason taken chance? see. 

No one forcing people get vaccinated, also exercising rights businesses, organizations, individuals protect folks choosing transmissible. 

If really personal liberty, think you’re entitled take stand make choice. don’t hold opinions.

On flip side, though, you’re endangering others need to, that’s matter opinion. 

At end day, it’s public health personal responsibility. It’s really sad we’re age society can’t trust people right thing anymore (at least America). I’ve heard local ER docs getting (appropriately) blunt too. 

When unvaxxed person shows COVID symptoms, region hospitals already stop elective procedures they’re overwhelmed, getting variation lecture along lines of: 

“You chose get vaccinated, choice you’re taking valuable time ER patients. don’t need admitted now. later, come back we’ll see room you. many people chosen get vaccinated, may may room then.” working come sick, patient, owe That's abrupt severance physician–patient relationship could result negligence suit causes injury patient would foreseeable reasonable physician.

Isn't NYC 70+% fully vaccinated? basically right. FDA want blamed months rare side effect creeps up.

 Problem is, 73 million children USA, even 1-in-100,000 side effect easily beat COVID terms harm. thalidomide people understandably nervous. FDA managing considering risks unvaccinated. need big age blocks? move slow pandemic.  spoke pediatrician last week said expecting able give shots right away EUA. vaccine stock steady, regular supply.

Personally, I’m much concerned abx resistance I’m largely support statements. don’t think it’s reasonable call question expertise physician case. It’s NIH guidelines CDC far I’m aware common nonetheless. case, hill want die on, curious. 

I think need much better job helping folks understand it’s important finish abx regimen start it. Definitely don’t want finish bugs survived, ones somewhat resistant likely, repopulate. Vaccine mixing (outside COVID) super common. Meanwhile, today's rollout mRNA shots, countries like Canada recommend getting whichever mRNA offered you. (I got Pfizer first, Moderna second.)

Even established relationship patient come sick procedure perform….a doctor refuse perform treat based personal health status. yes unvaccinated contributes personal health status. like lot pediatricians won’t perform certain procedures babies don’t vitamin k shots, vaccines.

Lots folks already decide simply go emergency room they're feeling sick (often part due insurance). That's long running problem since long pandemic.

I could see people simply opting approach without realizing ER's overwhelmed show wonder can't get treated immediately...  Yes, I’m TN agree it’s nightmare. It’s shame beautiful state mostly made morons. I've vaccinated mean I'm spreading lesser virus.

That saying - speaking regards viral load. Perhaps would helpful you?

""Data multiple studies different countries suggest people vaccinated Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine develop COVID-19 lower viral load unvaccinated people.(41-44) observation may indicate reduced transmissibility, viral load identified key driver transmission.(45) Two studies United Kingdom found significantly reduced likelihood transmission household contacts people infected SARS-CoV-2 previously vaccinated COVID-19.(25,  excellent physician.

People often forget doctors still humans. Sometimes may switch doctors find one get along take seriously. Sometimes doctors make mistakes. large trust them, comes big life changing diagnoses symptoms cannot seem resolve, wise seek second opinion sometimes (from another actual doctor, hate make clear). Omg THIS. pissed didn’t get pin sticker got jab February. people went April got free beer. 🤨 thought saw headlines. know what?

All said, immunizations umbrella.  initially conflicted Doctor refusing someone treatment, discriminating grounds, regardless good intentions.

Your example changed slightly, argument really holds true America view healthcare transaction exchange, service bought paid for. Heard said elsewhere: sure anti-vaxxers go hospitals get sick Covid.

Ya joke. restrictions, mask mandates, rules, etc... complete garbage punish behaving responsibly. THERE'S VACCINE MAKE PEOPLE TAKE IT. virus virus. I've vaccinated mean I'm spreading lesser virus.  


If vaccinated, catch virus, lesser chance becoming severely ill. That's choice. get vaccinated helps you. I'm safe, social distancing, going out, ordering groceries in, etc. helps everyone around me.    risk wait 1 year mark? flew Hawaii months back (pre-vaccine) negative test checked multiple times. trying downplay anything what’s people booster thread like “I got shot 5 months ago tested positive, mild symptoms bad news!” people like “yeah! It’s really concerning! People shouldn’t act like pandemic even you’re vaccinated, we’ll never get cause vaccines aren’t effective thought” concerning tested positive extremely mild symptoms? people still believing vaccine make immune get even it’s mild it’s bad news?

There *always* something building, even one there. good opportunity catch things too, building living thing sense always, always needs meet. Yeah... Like things covid-related, there's many different factors hard get clear picture. administer monoclonal antibodies tested positive asymptomatic?  start new subreddit called delicate sensibilities.   mean pays governor guess. I’m guessing rest us cannot get monoclonal antibody treatments unless nearly dying. That's true definition. Anti-vaxxers spreading around super weird talking point (I guess think kind ""gotcha"") completely made up. blame heard somewhere. 

No vaccine offers 100% immunity. close enough that, addition many measures, essentially ""beaten"" disease. Smallpox genuinely eradicated, polio completely marginalized, measles mumps strong regional immunity, etc. 

A vaccine injection given shortly infection provoke immune response help fight illness. 

Here's another interesting thing: diseases, like Mumps, infections subclinical due vaccination actually boost immunity people. that's another way vaccines help immunity despite completely stopping infections. 

(in fact, reminds ask askscience true covid not)  see would end? general issues authority

That’s exactly attitude want police officers /s   FDA? many countries already approved vaccines kids?   Way late that. republican legacy politicizing pandemic long outlast primary culprits.  Depends Aus are. QLD delta outbreak recently - 1 case turned 140 locked first case 8 days majority cases isolation community. 10 days lockdown haven’t cases community since days lockdown ended. life much close back normal living freely without covid. 

We know outbreaks things could change far kept bay since initial pandemic March last year. 

NSW current worst outbreak waited long (9 days) lockdown never ahead virus ended now. 

The challenge state dealing outbreaks get vaccination rates ASAP.   little info read lambda alarming concern mutations infect vaccinated. like version better.

There's alarming concern possibility vaccine escape every single variant, always turns nothing. media loves talk scary they'll always quote one two ""experts"" saying mutation might render vaccines completely ineffective never ends reflecting actually happens.  receiving monoclonal antibody treatment? Giving boosters Africa etc vaccinated stupid. massive drive vaccinate poorer countries else see new variants take hold possibly make even boosters pointless. astounding amount arrogance egocentrism recommend boosters now.  vaccinated December private practice, doctor refuse see patients (unless discrimination based race, sex, etc). happening years pediatricians refuse see kids parents refuse vaccinate. Arguably he's preemptively treating COVID making people get vaccinated. Alternate link require  statement said fully vaxxed, symptoms receiving monoclonal antibodies. Must nice sit mansion treatment come hospitals full.  remember suddenly crying shower around October / November 2019 got really high started picturing world gripped pandemic originating China, imagining isolated society would feel result all. within couple hours though really anything going time outside whole office seemingly catching flu stay home feeling like blowing things proportion.

That said, never really quite imagined it'd end quite like though. :/  turntables  Go get booster pretend it’s first shot seriously want people wear masks marathon? kidding? 64% figure assumes already. kids 12 make 15% population. 

Since R0 Delta requires probably 88% population vaccinated 100% effective vaccine, vaccines well protection infection Delta, never going hit herd immunity current vaccines. need high coverage possible least lower R-rate. Clearly 65-70% overseas enough keep R-rate down. Absolutely. It’s interesting see. Agreed. pandemic fiction piece would envision split 2 factions: First, ""community restrictions"" type want immediate strict lockdowns harsh measures stamp virus quickly, life go back normal, mask-free all. Second, ""personal restrictions"" type harsh lockdowns want businesses open, therefore favor masks, sanitizing social distancing New Normal would slowly gradually defeat virus without major upheaval.

Both sides would make sense then. sides least plan defeat pandemic. ""I wanna anything cuz wanna"" reality we're living ridiculously unbelievable, editor would say can't expect readers accept large sector society could dumb.  scientists found aerosol exposure directly deposited SARS-CoV-2 deep lungs, whereas fomite exposure resulted initial virus replication nose. Regardless exposure route, animals SARS-CoV-2 replicating lungs, lung damage severe aerosol-exposed animals compared fomite group.

This part interesting. breakthrough cases, people tend get upper respiratory infection. assume result poor mucosal antibody levels intra-muscular vaccination. wonder breakthroughs likely caused lax hand hygiene. people believe fomite transmission rare since stopped wiping things perhaps stopped washing hands often. would especially problematic social gatherings assuming adequate protection vaccine probably slowing hand surface cleaning. 

The blood antibody levels seem adequate serum studies show effective Delta neutralization vaccinated people. Perhaps blood antibody levels protect lungs effectively airborne transmission washing hands allowing upper respiratory infection fomites?

I tried everything getting horrible migraines due neck upper back pain, learned fair bit lots trial error.

Good luck! One aspect ""lots people died"" (which others mentioned) previous societies put we'd consider absolutely appalling child mortality rates even non-epidemic times. Many children died within first year ""normal"" conditions.

If kid could survive fifth birthday, chances making old age *too* bad. time they'd possibly exposed many worst things vaccinate today (measles, mumps, rubella, diphtheria, pertussis) plus viral infections like malaria influenza, bacterial infections like tuberculosis, cholera, scarlet fever, parasites hookworms. (Heck, still places developing world kids exposed diseases.) Many survivors permanent effects blindness, disfigurement, stunted growth.

This [1999 CDC child mortality across 20th century beginning 20th century, every 1000 live births, six nine women United States died pregnancy-related complications, approximately 100 infants died age 1 1900 U.S. cities, 30% infants died reaching first birthday.

And even worse 1800s medical statistics really got going field -- see [""Major Medical Explanations High Infant alarmed even frightened medical profession second half nineteenth century ever-accumulating numerical evidence infant death rate, one country another Britain, France, Prussia, Sweden, persistently hovering 150 200 per 1,000 live births.

All IMHO. Bro, country 1 Case 6 months get criticized ground people 200k+ cases country. want covid endemic New Zealand knows this. I'll take actions new zealand want covid places like US who've come terms covid 'common flu' unvaxxed vaxxed anyday Sadly do. Corporate gives whiners want, instead "" go elsewhere"" Per [NYT case tracking cases essentially plateaued past week, significantly lower levels South. Extremely encouraging. 

At point pretty clear there's striking correlation vax rates outbreak strength. 

* Relatively high-vax states seen cases rise, much slowly leveled out, leveled lower levels. exceptions (OR, WA, HI) low natural immunity
* Relatively low-vax states getting hammered. exceptions (e.g., Dakota's) off-season, albeit starting see case spread

A lot shifted weeks there. Seems like get worse gets better time tell. selfish. Yes partly! Thank great information! I’ve got friend New Zealand, they’re locked they’re happy right now. Currently country 3 day lockdown regions positive case going 7.

Yeah I’m gonna believe researchers one instead random redditor gut feeling. That's really accurate. None covid vaccines give sterilizing immunity, means still catch it. fall severely ill. Plus efficacy numbers people keep throwing around Alpha variant; moderate reduction efficacy Delta, thus possible might mild/moderate symptoms catch Delta. said, right, possible caught common cold instead. leave service industry this. clue going make money without it, bad still quit. really, really fucking dark soul sucking. service industry already pretty shit, least regulars would come treat like person. breaking point regulars came told would wear masks covid fake, know better.

Carbon capture tech also realistic ideas. friends factually incorrect covid, chime truth. mostly disagreements regarding risk tolerance, government authority, freedom vs. security thinks it’s fine different opinions these. Sorry obnoxious equation, *should mean* 1-((1 - efficacy)/3.5)

**Why equation?**

Well, say vaccine 70% effective. 1-efficacy = 1-0.7 = 0.3

This gives failure rate, sense.

Now, want something 250% better. given improved failure 0.3/(1+2.5) = 0.3/3.5 = 0.086

(To understand +1 bottom: consider something 100% better fails half often)

Finally, want give efficacy, failure rate, need 1-0.086 = 0.914 happy that? Smh  Delta variant bypassing vaccines delta surge pass point Yeah problem. People totally fucking national data crucial making decisions get pandemic.

Third-shot boosters likely soon. may better wait weeks better immune system reaction, similar British Canadians spacing second shots weeks apart US. 
 
This really problem opinion mods removing comments openly bragging even advising people game system. take medical advice redditors, holy shit obvious. keep hospitals filling w unvaxxed covid patients whenever massive surge tho? can’t keep delaying care every health issue requires hospitalization, causes everyone suffer more. may need medical infrastructure solely deals w Covid hospitalization care unvaxxed (which could, conceivably, paid raising insurance premiums unvaccinated, altho I’m sure insurance companies keep funds profit). agree one who’s gotten shots pay haven’t moving forward. mRNA AZ given VIPs wealthy. rest get Chinese Russian vaccines.

Go onto website see find rates myocarditis young teens - buried p.28.  you(maybe help reduce chance spreading virus, maybe please help try keep spread / keep hospital bed counts down, one could consider?)?:

maybe representative review IMPROVING BETTERING ideas, brainstorming, take makes sense implement, get ready implement, throw make sense implement (if voluntarily responsible choosing keep essential travel, grocery stores highest likelihood transmission taking place recirculated air)? not, maybe assess else?

Whole foods free delivery prime members automatically charge tip (which adjust).Though items stock, fix tip amount.Though refund eggs without question delivery took 2 hours. Walgreens signs curbside pickup locations.

Maybe grocery stores consider increasing employees online orders consider person orders (where person doesnt enter store) selling non-perishables outdoors;Taking food lists person people right running orders?They probably need store security also.

Maybe places consider selling school supplies outdoors taking orders get filled employees reduce risk virus spread? probably need store security also.

I kept seeing people reading product labels store (target products directions / label info website) taking while.Not sure accurate reduces risk read maybe think while.

USE SMARTPHONE TEXT-TO-TALKING APP ACCIDENTALLY UNKNOWINGLY SHEDDING/SPREADING VIRUS? can't afford that, pen &amp; paper show without touching?Dry erase board write big erase again?The banks something similar like using computers text-to-speech since right there, employees spreading virus particles recirculated air small bank spaces(Why verify IDs outside need customers take masks verify ID;then verify customers masks inside?Why take temperatures outside rather inside virus shedders wont enter infect air people breathe, virus really lasts 16 hours air)?

have grocery list ready go get there?

Maybe stores consider outdoor employees taking/setting orders in-person general public employees run right order &amp; there, public bring payment outside/OUTDOOR clerk right there, person go inside &amp; spread virus, come back prearranged time slot pickup order?If store afford it, makes sense, etc., waive delivery fee/making affordable immuno compromised (if greatest risk shedding virus, greatest risk getting sick / breakthrough cases help take load hospitals, etc.), parents kids, care homes, etc.(wherever greatest risks makes sense)?Maybe cities consider helping supplement stores money get going?

Maybe stores consider whether help remind employees follow disinfection instructions since normally takes 10 minutes disinfectant work advertised(not normally shortly wipe them)?  Finally coming first change! 😆 Unlimited Power! scale entire US, probably not. Things Florida really bad right though, doubting dont think vaccinated UK (could wrong though). UK still big increase cases, hospitalizations stayed fairly low deaths didnt rise anything close past waves. Unlike US South hospitalizations pretty high deaths may get past, definitely rising. agree everyone’s best interest get vaccines neediest areas world, strikes “easier said done” situation. think logistics (physical, political, etc.) make complicated seems. Feels like backsliding last year trailers pulled different parts country   Time factor here, mutation rate also function number people infected. vaccines may still highly effective virus commonly found year ago, look what's happened India since then. lived Franklin County. 30-40 miles bigger cities. 2 hours Portland Jetport. Good compromise. disagree that. disagree big problem really is. ""large swaths"" vaccinated people getting worst flu lives. Again, there's large sample size, always outliers. data support idea vaccines somehow failing. 

I agree media narrative there, underlying numbers support idea vaccinated people risk COVID. There's very, small chance end sort serious lifelong damage COVID vaccinated. Time collect 100 dollars Perfect 8 month mark 1st dose september. 

Let's gooooooo Vaccines like sunscreen. teach body fight virus without actually gotten virus. better actually gotten virus, infection viral loads one person another.

But end day, magically make immune. give body better chance fighting off. ultimately immune system.

For most, even get sick, immune systems strong vaccine given need prevent infection taking hold. others, may weaker immune system, vaccine gives huge head start, virus might still able take hold fight off. Hopefully faster lesser infection.

So, even vaccinated, important live healthy maintain strong immune system. Eat well, sleep well, exercise. key ""last year""

it supposed stop happening now, vaccine readily available US also prime example virus rampaging unvaccinated population. flattening curve 300,000 cases per day 100,000 cases doesn’t say much. Florida under-reporting last days released updated count (+870).

I'll interested see affects prediction. wondering Moderna also

From 
 Aug 05) **Moderna Inc. said** Thursday expects people received two-dose Covid-19 vaccine need **booster shot fall** keep strong protection newer variants coronavirus.  
The company said vaccine remains **90% effective preventing Covid-19 disease least six months**, said sees **decline antibody levels six months, especially newer strains** coronavirus including Delta variant. Phase 2 study, third shot original formulation showed robust antibody responses Covid-19 variants concern, Moderna said.  I'm parent I'd imagine I'd look another solution vaccine right around corner children. way healthy immune response works negative feedback mechanisms. regardless felt shot robust immune response, system regulated way won’t harm soon immune response gets ramped starts also quieting down. cases illness system gets severely disrupted immune response actually cause sort damage. worked public health first decade career. 

Most American south everything opposite centuries conventional public health wisdom.

They're trying get antibodies kids hard way achieve herd immunity, strong evidence post-infection antibody titers natural COVID infection last months.

On top that, startlingly high rate infertility, erectile dysfunction, lung damage, heart damage, brain damage, etc survivors moderate severe COVID cases. risk increases subsequent infection.

My kids' generation screwed adults making terrible decisions that's going affect rest lives. Today first day school district. Masks mandated, I'm still bracing impact. yeah know, redditors tried nothing already ideas never stopped eating clay. Theyve emboldened certain ""leader"" theyre taking ""their"" country back theyre ""real america""! time take car keys children. Yeah, pandemics take us shittier, boring adventure Gandalf does. I’d love keep debating guess go volunteer ICU now. says say average length stay COVID patient Hilo Medical Center four weeks, average stay non-COVID patient four days.

Sounds like need vaccine mandate curfew. I've got buddy rotations Crossville Idt he's well. death he's already seen like 2 months... da real mvp, thank you! evidenced UK Israel, can't vaccinate way it. However, significantly reduce severe outcomes. Much like US, issue countries going anti-vax contingent.  Yes, travelers vaccinated. God damnit I've covid vaccinated since March really dont want get again. Im physically fit man 20s health issues covid hit heart hard, gave severe tachycardia weeks made work 2 months (Firefighter). really want go :/ College Football starts Southern 500 runs Labor Day weekend…interested see numbers 2 weeks that. sticks beat with? may thing works point. 

Seriously though, can’t blame doctor. must really hard see many patients getting seriously ill dying something could easily prevent. I’m guessing won’t want deal hassle finding new doctor, especially it’s one they’ve long time. think mean vaccines know tamper hospitalization rate/death rate. full vaccination rate 80%, likely seeing kinds numbers. Additionally, know masks social distancing work. 

My point is, late pandemic terms known ways reducing spread virus stopping deaths. yet, learn anything people refuse take seriously. US? going get third?  Mask mandates solves worlds problems Sooner even. mom scheduled get third shot next Wednesday. also works healthcare maybe it’s option public yet. said job recommending booster 6 months.  majority humans share planet still waiting first jab. vaccine hospital admission, unless prevented getting vaccine age health related issue. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

No, isn’t plan either. low vaccination rates done end gradual reopen occur cases rise, hopefully slow enough doesn’t overwhelm health service.

That yet another overly optimistic covid vision. first batch covid vaccines sent US sending 488,370 doses Pfizer Rwanda global vaccination program called Covid-19 Vaccines Global Access, COVAX, White House official told CNN. batch includes first 188,370 doses 500 million Pfizer doses purchased Biden administration, official said. remaining 300,000 doses Pfizer going Rwanda come existing US supply. Googled myself, though I'd palsy may reaction viral infection. rarely occurs once. Bell's palsy characterized muscle weakness causes one half face droop. Bell's palsy usually resolves within six months. 3-day total, 1-day total, would 500 * 3, 1500. Minus already infected vaccinated, gives 3 years.

Well house prices rediculous shit.

You posted link exchange rates? economy whole. NZD extremely strong long time. Yes. I’d use N95/KN95/etc masks, well fitted possible. Surprised get BioNTech first cycle. got 1 dose AZ part trial 2 doses Pfizer became available (Healthcare worker). really wonder recommended me. mean black white dying dying, *are* worrying possible long-term health problems associated catching covid exactly wonder people want catch period. 

A friends caught covid recently (all 3 Pfizer) two absolutely laid third fever, one still taste back another says feels like 30% back weird rotten smell lot food enjoyed before, another feels like he's worried getting long-covid since still feel right weird brain fog/fatigue even weeks testing negative again.

Of course dying great, two-dose Pfizer showing around 39% chance preventing catching infection Delta (while still fantastic preventing death/hospitalization) exactly crazy people simply want raise number prevent possibility catching covid much possible. Good! Pediatricians using approach antivax parents years, hope works encouraging adult vaccinations well. similar experience Moderna. body ached beyond belief. freezing cold despite burning up. Severe debilitating fatigue 2 days. feel normal 4 days.

My first shot similar, somewhat milder, however took entire week feel normal. 

Thinking getting third shot exciting. It'll worth though. Bleh. That's insane vaccination rates NZ low? [Per CDC’s third dose immunocompromised People received either Moderna Pfizer vaccines….”Use vaccine product, feasible: People need additional dose received either Pfizer-BioNTech Moderna vaccine series receive third dose vaccine used.” Kate Brown 2 weeks late mask mandate… Ironic Villages “conservative”, yet amount libidinous activity make pornstar blush. adults.

The point study immune systems children work differently. vaccine likely work way, there's always chance won't.

A lot people seem understand adults children separated trials. Yes, countries large number vaccinated people infection rates ground restrictions lockdowns. Number hospitalized intensive care guide countries. Keep eye look new strands course covid around us long time forever measures take must based actual threat poses population. Florida here. vaccine stampede would good problem have. Need Doctors this. Losing one’s Doctor #1 reason fence finally get vaccinated. don’t NZ Australia high vaccination rate yet? That’s almost inexcusable affluent nation point

For one, cases. rushed emergency use vaccines meant later start rollout.  Pfizer's ""booster"" simply third dose? updated formula specific delta variant? Congrats almost graduating!! live here, hope end hospitalized. vaccine much else psychopaths spitting other's mouths time. Thank you. 

God damn, don’t people say that. Masks reduce spreading others. begin shedding virus 1-2 days symptoms delta becomes infectious sooner. planned trip several months prior things looking really optimistic think thought stayed mostly outdoors constantly masked would probably ok.  risk would taken still felt badly them. vaccines good especially preventing severe illness death, effective stopping spread virus. think vaccinate way it.  So, enough guarantee vaccines poorer countries year's end? Case numbers.

Exponential explosion something intuitive people. Many people believe hospitalization deaths metrics watch. However, see case numbers exponential curve, inevitable hospitalization deaths follow. Keep mind hospitalizations deaths several weeks behind cases.

You'll hear lot vaccines decoupling hospitalization deaths, that's also good way look increase cases directly leads increase hospitalizations deaths. vaccine protects 95%, that's pretty good. wave causes cases rise 20x, vaccinated wave similar protection unvaccinated wave. calling ""pandemic unvaccinated"" borders propaganda. true unvaccinated ones allowing Delta spread, true bear brunt damage, rising tide lifts boats.

People overvaluing vaccine's personal protection (which still great). Vaccines give two types protection: personal communal. mentioned before, personal protection vaccine gives makes wave similar unvaccinated outside wave. real power vaccines comes herd immunity. However, lot people understand, herd immunity reflected case numbers. Also, herd immunity binary, approach it, cases lower. Also, natural infection contribute herd immunity, though challenging track might contribute much. Also, coming months vaccine fully approved, workplaces enforce vaccination. Also, vaccine approved kids point well.

Adding things together hear people saying first big wave Delta might end phase pandemic: pretty soon people either going vaccinated natural immunity. drive cases down, COVID stay, case numbers settle lower upper bounds, similar flu, instead exponentially increasing sky.  Try calling location received vaccines. understand point, many making it, may find booster much extend immunity w/ antibodies another 6-12 months. Studies shown delaying even 2nd dose 12weeks (vs. 3/4weeks) leads much greater immune response. Hitting immune system 8months may cause robust response (T-Cell/B-Cell/Abs). need optimistic roll w/ bit. 
 
Furthermore, nasal vaccines future may help w/ preventing rapid replication Delta upper airways seems getting quick jump vaccinated people. I’d prefer day suffocating death hospital bed. Also look map, areas states coastal areas summer vacation destinations means places also exporting new cases rest country.   Yep. Even mask mandate place feel like essentially send kids school catch Covid. good choices left feels like shit. I'm ok I'm glad statistic. don’t think there’s booster shot. It’s third dose Moderna Pfizer vaccine. Israel reporting Side effects varied second shot milder. However, experience third shot worse second. manageable cold flu meds though. Still worth opinion get it.  got Moderna sick week. 

Friend got J&amp;J said felt nothing, side effects. get booster, puts ass like second shot can't risk getting anything even becomes yearly vaccine like flu shot. anyone take care dog 1-2 days recover, that's stopped getting flu shot. =[ Nowhere article mention maybe would good idea get damn vaccine. Deep cleaning ain't gonna crap airborne disease. 44% vaxx rate masking I'm sure deaths. Dibs, there's 1. [Florida testing less [Florida testing less would anyone bring unvaccinated children theme park right dumb. That’s probably got course. makes sense alright.

There much conflicting information though. would like see data. instance article says this: ""*even get two-thirds 60-plus [boosted], it’s gonna give us another week, maybe 2 weeks hospitals flooded*"", makes think worse reported.

If almost 60s least 2 shots half 3 intuitively giving 2 weeks temporary relief.

Intuition unreliable course. can’t read, spell apparently.  feel like FDA/CDC completely wrong point. Delta transmission explosion, basically risk vaccine vs catching actual disease. Either get vaccine time catch Covid. response 12s, especially 5, apparently go catch Covid. I’d say New Zealand model would perfect Hawaii.

Sucks tourists economy though.  vaccines given final FDA approval health insurance companies start raising premiums unvaccinated. cause employers start mandating vaccines control premium costs employees. Bruh nobody cares damn second derivative people getting virus every day sounds similar reaction 2nd shot get..... usually indication strong immune system response since recognizes 1st. order shots? Moderna x2 March/April got Pfizer couple weeks ago. Pfizer smaller (30mcg Moderna's 100mcg), figured sufficient months. they're stalling reason, like get vaccines, get it

That exactly reason. Australia. Need 3 months. read room. Younger people die drug overdoses covid. leave behind younger orphaned children. they’re urgent care instead ER doesn’t mean won’t END hospital days/weeks later. people go urgent care beginning sickness, hasn’t progressed enough require ER care. 

You said 6 breakthroughs day “not huge number”, yet know many people see day/come testing/etc. You’re passing judgement writing insignificant, isn’t big number. 

MSM saying breakthroughs rare. small urgent care 6 day means probably LOT breakthrough cases going reported.  Even fully vaccinated? Even Germany ask bit careful It’s year already. don’t understand schools Dept. Education revamped schooling accommodate virtual learning. person school pandemic feasible. It’s going stop-start year like this. Walgreens walkins third Covid vaccine dose. make sign saying qualify pharmacist speaks find condition qualifies you. CDC list Qualifying conditions   literally not? expectation vaccines magically developed, tested, approved overnight childish naïve. already miracle first vaccines SARS-CoV-2 available within 2 years virus's discovery. can't continue expect miracles like that. Please. would also take requiring employees vaccinated requiring us return office hybrid format. 

But money would nice too.  see anything wrong said, need make life boring, difficult, complicated possible choose get vaccinated. me, want participate society, following basic societal expectations. want operate outside norms acceptable standards isolated alone forever stop stubborn.

My honest belief genuine ignorance lack information. think people KNOW good them, like children, want eat vegetables unless dish want eat it. That's what's really going here. Plain stubbornness pain ass sake contrarian piss ideaological opposites.

There story posted elsewhere got lot traction someone right leaning spectrum bluntly said refuse get vaccine like Iiberals advocating want make mad. can't make up. booster potentially side effects actual vaccine? can't again, even per year - stopped getting flu vaccine reason, someone take care dog 1-2 days anyone call immediately that. booster bed-ridden I'll stop that, regardless whether becomes yearly dose. =/ Good him. fucking morons want endanger around ostracized. Voluntary stupidity carry price doctor patients: “We yet great treatments severe disease, great prevention vaccines. Unfortunately, many declined take vaccine, end severely ill dead. cannot force anyone take vaccine, also cannot continue watch patients suffer die eminently preventable disease,” letter said. “Therefore, October 1st, 2021, longer see patients vaccinated COVID-19. wish keep physician, documentation vaccination suffice. wish choose another physician, happy transfer records.”

He said 3 people already asked get vaccines. Enough carrots, time sticks.  Even Russia full free vaccine access 15% population vaccination rate. gonna mutate wants. Refusing protect citizens 10-15% willing and/or accessible population 3rd world countries vaccinated help stop mutations. Sending vaccines poor country maybe vaccinate 10% population there. mean still send vaccines places especially protect health workers, ""waiting"" booster shots sort dumb benefit.  Yes, I'm going tomorrow. Yep, adults were. Kids young.  recent friends catch really everything right felt badly them.  said left Disney literally day reinstated mask mandate. photos showed ones masks. masks mandated might safer?   within Orthodox Jewish community. sure hospitalizations saw this. Would like know. sure there’s tracking. Would helpful know. Man ....... already got 2 shots lol..... Waaaaaaaaaaa...    Oh well gotta guess  Pregnancy listed CDC Condition qualifies third covid vaccine dose. CDC website stickers gave huge! can’t fit another card, DARNIT. kidding, brah. There's enough problems world could outraged about. Vaccinations never one them. Get shots shut would take. Also, way dude commented doctor. he's holistic doctor, something take vaccine takes seriously. Plus, never truly done here, done everywhere. curfew I’ve five doses hope would apply certain places, liability issue larger specific vaccines. US, vaccine manufacturers legislatively exempt liability cases. Outside US, indemnification clauses standard licensing agreements vaccines, regardless local legislation issue. get sued, especially since usage label. 

Issuing statements application timelines probably PR liability. prescribed timeline effective found testing, delayed second dose promising untested, getting front shields potentially damaging headlines delayed dose strategy ended misguided.  think pastors motivated money anything else.

Really think it. money making racket. monday's even weirder used backlogs  information circulating population wont recommended get boosters 8 months out?  got J &amp; J, folks certain age immunocompromised? 

Without data I'm aware of, seems potentially overreaction give boosters anyone compromised immune systems elderly much need/demand vaccines world wide. potentially sets precedent we're going see massive portion vaccines produced syphoned first world boosters, perpetuity, slowing initial doses rest world tremendously. really seems like myopic strategy me, since everyone would benefit rapid increases immunity world wide, even considering chances new variants forming. Shhh anxiety handle much Per Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) used collect reports adverse events vaccination general public. primarily used identify potential topics investigate regards vaccine reactions. However, event data VAERS often verified often self-reported, assumed adverse events VAERS actually associated cause vaccines, possible estimate frequency adverse events data.

2. flu kills thousands every year, usually causing pneumonia stressing older, chronically ill people’s bodies. 

Just FYI. Oh hell no. Also, requires math, 70% county vaccinated, 1% people hospital vaccinated, means 30% population accounting 99% cases. 

Meaning roughly ~231x likely end hospital unvaccinated compared vaccinated person. 

Using San Diego County's numbers (73% vaccinated, 97.5% hospital unvaccinated) means 110x likely end hospital unvaccinated. 

Math fun, let vaccine breakthrough percent rising factor population distribution! AMEN! They're understaffed patients literally dying inadequate care

If NZ wants continue live life normally, zero covid way go 80%+ population vaccinated. lol, got me. know tell you. acting like said enough cover everyone needed booster problems, didn't. 

My point have, *like said*, million doses ready expire reason given boosters people need (e.g. elderly immunocompromised). understand even arguing acknowledge that. playing COVID data sets past weeks. feel like enough people understand variant data. don’t seem understand it’s possible patient zero new, transmissible even virulent strain. hundreds, thousands, documented variants, mapped little evolutionary tree.

As Howard says tweet, two states appear ""at plateau beyond right now."" Sign fuck up! I've seen various numbers. One doc area (central FLA) NPR could sworn gave higher number % I've seen. Anecdotally brother others know work ICU, number low there; higher hospital overall. ICU course really sick people, puts it--you get vent, probably getting it. 


I one friend got sick enough go ER, recovered well treated (so far least). waited get treated ended pneumonia. seems close extreme end vaccinated cases.  brother said vaccinated people died ICU tended issues well.  SUS stands Unified health system Portuguese Thank you! far vaccine masks seemed work! 1 week hah  dug baseline Canada: 

 Every year 3k Canadians 19 (that's way tables tabulated) die causes.

 Roughly 1400 stillbirths birth defects.

 Another 600 accidents, suicides, homicides.

 remaining 1000 pretty much everything else - includes diseases, polite ""we know"".

 Adjusted Canada's population, 400 deaths per year would 50. see, either relatively small number (if compare 3k), medium number (if compare 1k diseases), large number (if compare 20 people die flu season). *Obviously*, people want extra 50 children dying, but, again, measures drastic, people take risk, reasonable way looking (comparing overall deaths children 19 per year) increase (1-2%) incremental.

I like calculated different risk ratios different ages, elderly obviously got vaccines earlier. I'm sure comparisons *within* age groups perfectly valid. Israel rolled vaccines rapidly, could prompt someone get vaccines 146 days later others age group, vaccine hesitancy? early adopters eager vaccine, late group hesitant, could significant behavioural differences contribute different infection numbers. can't wait see mum dad again.
