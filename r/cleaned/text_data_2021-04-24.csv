This past year feels like blur. thankful we’ve turned corner.

Edit: I’m thankful we’ve turned corner *in US*. calculated based many people died many vaccine point. no, CDC announced investigation. 3rd highest G20 mess? current vaccination rates, Canada would reach herd immunity US thanks Trumpist anti-vaxxers. isolated cases, odds mutating variant significantly evades immune response would low.  said one dose there's highly likely people second within 2-3 weeks. 

No imply 1 dose vaccine fully vaccinated might want read MINE again. Again. objectively wrong this. matter patriotic. Objectively, quite nations worse US. seems like axe grind america mad vaccines not. That's fine. let's make shit up. India, currently, far worse america ever been. testing rates, since mentioned blow everyone else's water. test, lot. find publish cases not. Hence high reported numbers. India likely like half million cases day right now, triple reported deaths  Oh yeah covid sure blame least partially blame loss too. losing pandemic slowly wasn’t committed it. pandemic really changed priorities. got sick February 2020 initially lost 20lbs that. thought dying. got snow ball weight loss going me. think covid may really bad flu. Testing wasn’t yet. outlook priorities life completely changed. 5 defining moments life 2020 fifth one. Flurona vaccines: coming soon. Ok sure, head, constrained rollout situation, feels like good threshold deciding roll single doses far possible looping back second dose. Caveat: I'm neither medic epidemiologist. Arm feels like played 'frogger' best bud cares....

I'm...so confused. arcade game? Source? matter obligation decency. US could've primarily vaccinated people still exporting doses long ago. Vaccinating young healthy Americans (and even children!) vulnerable people health workers elsewhere dying ok. Personally I'd argue US EU (and lesser degree India China) global vaccine production capacity got certain global responsibility here. really ""helping"" - happen places vaccines made anyway. obligated anything course. selfish like. Noname source. That’s simply true. Biden Trump anything vaccine production American people still same. always lol Yes, risk West this. sheer number cases, far higher officially reported, increases possibility variants emerging current vaccines less effective against. trying alarmist, partly CDC others still cautious. Everyone tested positive close staying home, except serious cases taken hospital.   feel like huge overlap group people want traditional vaccine group get vaccine pause. Damn, actually makes feel better it! looked so...shitty, works, works! Free trade short answer. 

We’ve got little way domestic manufacturing, happens elsewhere. 

We one lab conservative government (like America’s republicans, least aspiring be) sold.

Also, takes time vaccination work entire population evidenced number new cases plummet. US showed little sign yet. yes that's meant, US would abuser without look back all. referring USA then? abuser/rapist?  buy all. Polling indicates least 70% people willing get shot. downvoted?

Monday, recovering vaccine side effect human brain lacks ability imagine numbers tragedy scale.

Ugh. development stage India currently roughly Vietnam. Vietnam's GDP per capita slightly higher India's surpassed India's recent year. Vietnam also never double-digit growth past 20 years. Total GDP wise, Vietnam's GDP way smaller India's. India also additional advantage way developed pharmaceutical manufacturing industry compared Vietnam. ""less developed"" excuse India gov mess epidemic control things progress point. US EU also richer also messed epidemic response. Sustained economic development expand much resources hand handle future epidemic, matter much resources have, dont know use it, pouring resources problem may well pouring salt ocean. India right now, needs resources competent administration actually work instead politicking. Tiny compared long term risks COVID-19. mRNA? Extremely &lt;-- might actually slight decline week second &lt;-- cumulative incidence curve think may missing point little... 80% COVID deaths didnt need happen... ""IN HINDSIGHT""... hindsight's powerful thing...

When virus first came out, doctors didnt know drugs would work. Giving patient ""cheap"" drug could easily made worse better. sufficient evidence cases say ""hey look! drug sure helps COVID patients"", dont think doctors, good people general justify witholding them.

:) already past 80% 65+ 52.5% age 16+. certainly hit 70% adults 80% likely end summer. got second shot yesterday— likely would spread covid someone else point? Good hear. Honestly either wife felt anything must slept it. 1 done 6 billion go. Let's hope light oncoming train... ? saying one ""they changed minds"" things, remember experts imperfect, generally better informed rest us. That's they're experts. Changing mind new evidence scientists do. done since January small adult family homes residents can’t leave home. 5G microchips jazz lol original 1918 flu deadly covid today first appeared. 

You know annual flu season still today? Yep, thats direct descendent 1918 flu, became less deadlier still kills 50,000 year within US alone.

So yes, journey probably forever. future flu season covid season. Yes UK variant came along. Either way, we're near finish line now.  Yeah truth global scale 25 million doses barely dent much. However would godamn nice exported either to: smaller population developing countries could REALLY use right 25 million doses count HUGE send Mexico securely set like Canada next months. 

I know us Canada wish could get those, many secured ramped one highest daily vaccination rates per capita I'd feel ton happier lesser fortunate country got some. Many appear anywhere, government India even know many citizens has. dunno like WW2 guess that’s assuming they’ll life restrictions way makes sense. time everyone vaccinated, they’ll probably already booster totally see wanting extend lockdown everyone booster. makes mutates worse? example virus made contact people received vaccine, virus die, gets foothold within body mutate became resistant vaccine? 

This already happened,   common courtesy sick (or unwell) people wear masks. like years East Asia, require mandate. But, sarcastic...   long take?  Considering US fewer people vaccinated UK Israel, ten times amount cases, seem like great idea. Dude, around 83% adults vaccinated Lol live? live major city they’ve one single weekend allowed people 60-70 age range get vaccinated. That’s two days. Outside we’re even close done group two. Imagine number doubles 2 weeks Here's published result Brazilian primary efficacy symptomatic COVID-19 50·7% (95%CI 36·0-62·0). secondary efficacy cases requiring assistance (score≥3) moderate severe cases (score≥4) 83·7% (95%CI 58·0-93.7) 100% (95%CI 56·4-2100.0) respectively. numbers among English learners students disabilities even higher. It’s gonna take decade sort happened forget mention worst-est case scenarios... mention + likely asymptomatic first much longer inhibition period.  Thanks PM Narendra Modi, Donald Trump steroids. think it’s entirely unrealistic expect entire world okay locking completely 3 months. Disregarding economically impractical straight goes human nature somewhat specific countries regions you’re asking almost 8 billion people that. expect?

And even countries largely beat covid, they’re back normal. Countries like Australia still initiating lockdowns whenever see new community transmission. may screwed world they’re back normal. Absolute best case scenario would rest world would like that, controlled transmission still restrictions regardless.

The reason become I’m young, already COVID, bit chicken comes needles, thought one done appealing.

I wanted J&amp;J shot, second thoughts, better toughing getting two shot robust protection, misinformed protection different three? 

If it’s much difference I’ll opt two shot, however preferably one done sounds way better me.  US surplus. I'm car fan, watching video coverage Shanghai Auto Show right now. people attending show STILL wearing masks. They've essentially zero outbreaks Shanghai 12 months, yet Chinese still wearing masks indoors safe. east asian countries like China, South Korea, Vietnam etc managed continue keep lid covid. No. Check seropositivity survey liked comment. make statements can't prove evidence. Yep. Ive seen homeless collapse drugs SF before. Would love see estimate many foreigners traveled US get vaccinated. guess small number. government's ""India First"" policy working really well /s

This happens highly uneducated PR champs top. Wow Trump would rolling grave. Oh wait soon It’s second ramadan I’m spending completely apartment. Feels surreal North Dakota winter also unbelievably cold. car breaks winter call AAA tell stay car bundled doors windows closed. leave car -20F easily die. Like tear ducts freeze kind cold.

Because often impossible exercise outdoors shutting gyms 6 months isnt easy California (elderly people exercise may lose ability walk even). Opening windows windy -10F outside really option either. Neither outdoor dining.

I'm sure tropical Indian slum windows doors open better worse places problems. Sad. 

Pathetic. 

Nearly 1.4 billion people virus running wild them, greatly increasing risk even lethal contagious variants emerging, government focusing Twitter. doubt solved national level, without international measures, like smallpox back then. 
Unless vaccinate world, mutations create make second flu, haunt us way. * Send vaccines smaller countries getting citizens vaccinated.

Initially imagined USA would stop export Raw materials Vaccine production

* huge spike exported vaccines.

We exported 6 crore (60 million) vaccinated 15 crore (150 million)

* Blame US india enough vaccines?

Good Excuse American. 



P.S. comment going make Americans Mad cares. course blind eye . fun place people see two perspectives . guess people used much privilege cannot see hateful hate towards anybody non west .It's talk respond them.  laws, government reach. times create strong men I'm aware. I'm saying there's many people think actually important minds, matter whether younger people get with. talking options, took help Germany, SA, UAE, Singapore, Russia feel strange kinship Brazil.

You stay safe happy believe Western news outlets show. worry us get soon said ancestors bought worst still stood
I know fucking humanity westerners show every time. thanks concern 
Lastly Lots love India, Stay safe. That's herd immunity works. high enough percentage population immunity vaccination infection, imagine 90%, 10% get virus purely unlikely come contact someone infectious disease die out. Chicken pox good example look related shingles well. Look herd immunity works spreading myths stop spread causes slow burn lol. last polio case? slow burn cases there... number tests always drop less people getting sick. reason positive test rates useful. number tests drop percentage positive increase know system overloaded. number tests drop lower percentage positive know real reduction. Yea that's true, I've got mild symptoms far. 🤞 getting downvoted far Yes, people staying home, official numbers COVID cases fall authorities declare premature victory again... Considering climate change crisis, billion people becoming infertile might bad think, especially happened randomly one country disproportionately affected. already almost 8 billion us planet. need *more* people. Modi makes Trump seem competent world fourth place 7day average deaths per million, behind France (two times higher India), Germany United States.

It high, record high measure blatantly ignore practically unknown statistical principle - compare apples oranges. highly provocative tweets could potentially spark violence. see couple well Dude look countries u.n human rights council tell china country I'm southeast people take covid serious wear masks willingly minority mocked it. know, sucks, sadly can't think succinct accurate way put it.

Sometimes truth looks like that. likely Russia China? seem escaping covid destruction. another reason use Twitter. People dying supreme leader's dignity must intact. currently living dictatorship.  Well, obviously nowhere (at least Europe) safe absolute terms. Mallorca much lower infection rate Germany. got severe covid? point vaccine reduce severe cases, hospitalisations deaths. stop cases completely. open you?   Well China managed get reelected UN Human Rights Council quite recently despite ongoing genocide supporting one worst dictatorships world (North Korea), gained plenty influence. aid, infrastructure stops soon countries goes China. actually covid test done boarding, negative. one bothered check it. Rest assured travel important covid. technically true, that's racist way phrase  ostrich, fully agree you. Nevermind nebulous whole phrase is. No, won't. That's completely realm scifi movie stuff, multiple reasons.

Two weeks barely enough time infected event start showing hospital (incubation time + time sick needing hospital care).

There enough people infected event anyway. Plausible ranges would hundreds infected, means tens people attendees hospitalized. course, extra cases go infect others, general effective R community: everyone infected Florida infects 0.8 people average, extra cases added much, infected 1.1 people, would add cases time - average decreasing vaccinations, hard say many.

Whether adding hundreds cases worth joy event debated. useless pretend single even could result explosion cases (especially impossible quickly). policy makers talk individual events, single event something huge, general principle.  every India-covid related thread defending Biden...

you desi-american guess, crying Virus spreading India due Biden, ourselves...what crying is, fkin raw materials millions vaccine America hoarding, like astrazaneca's even using it. little empathy. raw materials, India, tomorrow poor nation (won't even able make noise) suffer due shortage. math. many people math..... Hating sake trying appear world-weary intelligent hinting [Here I'm opposite, dad vaccinated feel much less scared worry giving everyone able get vaccinated, sure. current state supposed protect, reason lived restricted lifes whole last year, free run around fun stuff, rest still lives restrictions X15-20** Modi led Indian government* bruuuh literally common sense? situation someone steps purpose bear trap shouts help... people stop supporting Twitter start moving Mastodon. important look first dose percentage first dose offers lot protection weeks. govt use law censor twitter social media platforms yet again. effect would work Indian populace actually cared fixing problems rather concerned would happen information got out. Okay??? problem isn’t lack food it’s lack medical supplies uneducated population thinks covid doesn’t exist. Y’all dying disease killed way people Spanish flu it’s embarrassing defending situation.  No, matter priorization. would much prefer Australia compared basically country world right covid perspective. way hand already, everyday I'm hearing news acquaintance passing away. There's shortage oxygen, hospital beds, medicines.This already worst case scenario. large majority Indians got access internet without education all. people belong rich poor sections society. might ask , ""if stupid become rich"" , well , politics course. Film industry, businessmen etc exist yes often people got politics, became rich , fking idea going gonna mouth twitter. 

These hyper National degenerates India. 500 million strong. 

Flat earth society anti vaxers get lot traction online ludicrously dumb average indian netizen sculpted exactly piece shit. think America same? Also china give two shits votes, want countries default control inferstructure Australia also less cases YEAR UK yesterday. pressure high. Lol got second dose vaccine month ago. Today tested positive. yea, that's bit naive think that's gonna solve well mean kinda saying little bit true. lot poor people India, hard board flight maybe covid? US? 


I think deep inside know China wants get poor countries side use vote comes debating genocides violating human rights. China Africa too. certain people wanted certain things phased Internet due perceived offensive content.

They realise opening flood gates. ban censor something, nothing bad happens, think they're going stop banning censoring content? True india’s cases/test bottleneck worst ever. cant diagnos case simply can’t run test this. Nope, doses Biontech produced Europe, partially Biontech India developed country vast majority people easily order food ubereats. 

A lockdown india would cause lower class *starve death* since need city open money spend. Can't give unemployment benefits 1.3 billion people... reformulate vaccine include mutated strains like flu vaccine happened? wonderful countries wonderful people. wish best luck nothing best. Keep safe! Oregon data covaxin vaccine, sure “new” shows vaccine able neutralize variant in-vitro. best knowledge, in-Vivo studies clinical trials performed yet since variant identified late February became serious concern past month. PM incompetent person gave ever seen India. another person would resigned long back modi would not. shameless  That's exactly point. sent anyway needed it. Whether useful irrelevant. president tweeted thank PM. help needed need it. That's point.  Idk maybe one referenced first comment stayed fuck home Easter. people learn holidays death? america? I'd interested see percentage New York residents who've actually tested. blamed Argentina worldwide COVID outbreak.

Hey now. usually fuck one us. Maybe need lower population seen harder days British created Bengal Famine, 1918 Spanish flu need worry us worry yourself. Today enough FDI Food grains feed India next 2 years. I've shots month ago still wear mask public indoor spaces, eat restaurant food outside home. say was, said wish america would neighbors list, pick random. That's reason. Dear US politicians, send stupid Astra Zeneca vaccine abroad. Now. want it. Several countries showing worrying numbers, India Brazil already experiencing catastrophe. send away. Now. later, now. Every minute hold make us look evil, helps single american, losing precious time saving lives. 

Come on. keep ones using, send ones using away. Syria neighboring country China Balearic Islands **very** good situation 2 months now. Around 50 cases daily population around 1 million, barely people died last month hospitalizations basically low they've since beginning pandemic. people eligible (everybody now), idiots know aren’t getting vaccinated reasons. 

I’m evaluating friendships it. incorrect. EU could place position US banned exports Pfizer, power law produced much US Q1 early Q2. ""special relationship"" legal mechanism gives rights vaccines contracted produce US include ""America first"" clause doses produced there. Additionally US enacted export ban raw materials means production US greatly helped this. combine two things get high production cannot legally exported unless US allows people eligible (everybody now), dole’s know aren’t getting vaccinated reasons.

Want go sit restaurant dine in? Sure. that. Want go Walmart grocery store mall fun? That's allowed. Yes, may asked wear mask take off, nothing going happen. already life back. even see grandparents they've probably vaccinated. motivation take vaccine? ""right"" thing do? cares that? keep seeing articles like none giving hard numbers/percentages.


We're dealing variants known highly contagious. possibility we're seeing influx younger patients simply there's greater overall number people getting infected begin with? Add fact fair number 60+ people vaccinated, kinda makes sense seeing shift towards younger patients becoming hospitalized.

Google it. Plenty data vaccine willingness &amp; speed manufacture. recall reading ny times, that's good enough you. know vaccinated people still potentially spread right? massively reduce transmission rate, reason take chance bit cloth annoys you. don’t understand everyone coming woodwork calling lockdowns. It’s year point ample evidence countries regions locked better took voluntary measures. example Italy, Spain, Germany, etc strict lockdowns terrible outcomes.   problem they’d treat blood clots blood thinners, generally risky could make even tiny scratch scary situation.

I would excused first wave would continued India, however, got lucky gained ample amounts time deal issue. simply utilised properly current administration. That's hilarious. funny? 8% skipping second dose almost impact compared 30-40% may get one all. keep mind, people financial position quit. Many people privilege able quit something like this. I'm sure actual % people strongly prefer WFH much higher. Oh enlightened soul. Thank much opening eyes. vaccines india give US? yes, pressure mount Biden give AZ doses. aren’t using those. private company!! whatever want!!! anecdotes change fact manufactured enough cover adults say want them.

It would grossly irresponsible Biden ship supplies elsewhere case. Last time massively strict lockdown happened India, folks started walking home villages thousands kilometers away. Many died. strict lockdown, trains shutdown too, result feel. Everyone knows r/india nothing worry. I’m conflicted one. whole family completely pro vax, wife double doses Moderna, mom (62) got J&amp;J ended putting hospital multiple severe blood clots lungs. didn’t get brain blood clots survive, huge impact likely leave copd blood thinners next year... worse part doctors said least 8 female patients hospital similar symptoms... impulse still downplay agree COVID worse, think women need aware outcomes aren’t rare media coverage discussing. suspect they’re reporting cases fatal heart/brain clots, blood clots major organ dangerous. Stay safe ladies! Ah good hear.  looking appointment trackers much since wife got ours, seeing daily doses really dropped figured demand situation same, especially since there's really rural areas.

So, fine, I'm glad removed whatever red tape place, nowhere else world know red tape. ONE MONTH???? Try 3-4. said benefit wearing face masks.

No didn't, said people infection little benefit. also said time sick could benefit process breaking transmission wearing one. statements align completely understanding time, thinking airborne. Covid previously? Osterholm mentioned way vaccines work, first dose immune system primer second big push, postulating covid previously may bigger reaction first dose instead. It’s bit odd seem spent much time seeing people obligation. can’t remember ever feeling way life. Well change good you, go guess.  Immunity infections good long lasting vaccinations, generally, vaccines history. exceptions. current Covid19 vaccines show hint among exceptions.

Immunity infection SARS-CoV-1 (SARS 2003) detectable 6 12 years infection. Covid19 caused SARS-CoV-2, 79% genetically identical. 

Sera people recovered Covid19 given least one dose Pfizer neutralized SARS-CoV-1. put variant fear bed. 

Vaccination likely grant long lasting immunity, probably decades, possibly life long. definitely is. Biden interested improving much-better-off America helping country need. 

India gave, like, 50 million something doses country, UK too. Nobody giving back except Germany. cases soaring - every second person tests positive. 🤔

I think hoping get new strain virus variant named them. becoming problem Canada. long problem US I'm afraid. Also glad vaccine protects though. country, appointments going unfilled. walk pharmacy get vaccine. enough supply. case - appointments everywhere dc now, especially pharmacies Literally media BS Got it, agree even think that's controversial since well documented.  country does, world doomed. Vaccines stop India's outbreak, stopping production cause one like US.

In plane, put mask first. someone's drowning, jump let pull under. Cool story bro. Im denying happened, american nationalism causing take stance first place. anything canadian lipid point point nationalism. realize support includes vaccine related components, correct? no, false news. better.

Most people followed guidelines 2020. 2021 came around leaders started acting beat covid even though 50,000 daily cases baseline.

Thus life started return normal. Large political rallies due upcoming elections, nobody wore masks, movie theaters opened back up, large religious gatherings took place again.

New Zealand could say beat covid. India beat covid.  Y'all realize usually one person family bothers get tested, right?

This much worse seems Vaccine hesitancy nowhere near big deal EU compared US. bet EU reach 70% population fully vaccinated US tops around 60% whole thing horrifying. US (still have?) Mobile frozen morgues. remember New York also digging mass graves. pictures Michigan hospitals corpses piling hospital room. messed thing live through!  full control car, share road cars control over. cars danger anyone car. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Mexican food since start pandemic. Pfizer private company fuck want vaccines. Biden decide. spent billions research development it... deserve choice sell distribute products.

Last time checked, America blame India stupid choice electing orange imbecile blame India 1/2 million deaths due incompetent government. hard take responsibility instead blaming countries? I've keeping graphs number countries (and US states) doing. graph India's rate new cases since pandemic began. really shows quickly get understand that, mean time i’m 2 weeks decent protection similar Jnj, regular things? traveling domestically United States, contribute little local economies: cooking food, camping public lands. cost gas negligible benefit. Tourist commissions hate me. 

Traveling SE Asia affordability isn’t much need savings. hostels $10/night cheaper. Flights much gasoline pay domestically driving. Food cheaper normal day. expensive part mandatory guides places like Kinabalu. Golly miss Sabah. hope that’s true. We’re 50% adults one dose city right now, demand nose-diving. 

Among coworkers, it’s like 25%. 🙄 India need WiFi Routers? /s oh definitely big sigh relief. want know go regular things similar Jnj people do. way cdc makes seem really stuff 2 weeks second. definitely get second dose though, want know fun once. Well never going protected via vaccine, basically saying never end.... mean. exercise home.

I don't. can. Maybe study long term impact experimental injections? 76% isn’t low anyway. Sure shit beats current situation.   reason yet believe vaccines won’t stop it. vaccinated countries risk lower. countries low vaccination rates, unclear Ironically:

The claim: new Pentagon microchip tell COVID-19

...

Our rating: Partly false

The claim sensor developed Pentagon scientists microchip antenna that detect COVID-19 PARTLY FALSE, based research. sensor microchip, inert metal could relay personal information devices. developed private company, though using federal funding. chip also directly detect COVID-19, relay information changes molecules could indicate presence COVID-19 brings 90fps too! Clicks Lol, tell someone don’t data back claim I’m downvoted oblivion. Damn folks fragile 🤣 Yes protected. No, far vaccine passports immunization requirements ""fully vaccinated"". definitely started changing behavior 2 weeks post mRNA vaccination, happy 80 percent protection might different risk tolerance. vaccine development? thought Pfizer Moderna J&amp;J companies funded started everything themselves. could totally wrong though, I'm really sure. Yep Many millions skipping second dose. Write article them.  exclusively, 85-90% deaths age 65+. There’s reason to. like using better mask actually would benefit work get home depot like 2$ per mask would sell explicitly dusty environments, like sanding

One size fits most? Nope. EU contract specifies 4 production facilities, 2 EU 2 UK. Doses SII never meant shipped Europe.  Especially since going need strong India push back China next 30 years want keep Singapore straight open well push back Iran.  ...

Gala expected sent home week Beaumont Royal Oak. brother-in-law, caught virus around time, died days ago another hospital.

Gala still wonders caught virus.

“I wearing masks sometimes wasn’t,” said. “I never public without mask. biggest regret didn’t get vaccinated. life-changer me.”

__ 1 dose get stereoscope streaming. 2nd dose holographic patch update iirc. prefer wear one, always bad thing harder recognize. also subject-specific library reference work closely public, bad worry someone getting spit face. work setting, sick/contagious people allowed walk interact me, mind continuing wear mask around like getting sick anything work. put giant mask every toilet, problem solved got job three months back hehe bet population highest rush group larger population UK Fall ends Dec 1, Michigan’s case peak late November. Seems like accurate description vaccines operate completely different ways, firm study accepted CDC efficacy one dose 2 weeks.

You fully vaccinated. fully vaccinated 4 weeks, 2 weeks second dose.  actually good news know yet.

They're monitoring everyone part trial find signs waning immunity. we'll decent warning happens, yet. make sound like 20 million people nothing. 20 million people gain protection virus, cost US. billion Africa alone, yet vaccinated. confirm; I'm MI. gf 1 yr old hospitalized Beaumont 10 days ago nursing staff said way pediatric patients time around. baby discharged ok, thankfully. Based estimated death rate (not reported one) reports coming hospitals morgues, may well case. would decent immunity either way trials done different settings head head comparison. Also data happens long term skip 2nd dose mRNA vaccines one officially consider “fully vaccinated”. 

So wondering whether breath sigh relief, yea big extent. wondering whether get 2nd dose, definitely get  average death rate, despite one oldest states union. Still, impressive given rest Europe.  Florida one oldest populations, one biggest co-morbidities, way plus. Also middle pack terms obesity. many factors hard compare states, way clear Florida poor job. Yea, that's precisely i'm talking about, never actually collective immunity flu, often vaccinate wrong ""souche"" (don't know word english) 

That's exactly covid become endemic, like flu. think lot people advocating US helping India forgetting India FOUR TIMES US population can’t even get first dose everyone wants one right now. hell going able significantly assist India meaningful way? helping won’t effective doesn’t mean shouldn’t it, going drop water ocean. hard help country doesn’t seem interested helping itself. amount people dismiss “long covid” anxiety disturbing. yes, 100% you. don’t want lose sense taste smell, don’t want inhalers, anything like that... happen “mild forms” disease. Vaccines way need preponderance people get vaccinated truly almost-no-risk situation... people feel case day first dose 🤦🏻‍♂️ possible hit wall vaccine acceptance US, could send surplus vaccines instead raw materials? India's pretty bad already mutating hospitals overwhelmed. We're least stable. going good country India starts collapsing. Per capita (100k) far important look - Florida almost exactly mirrored New York deaths since beginning year, less cases New York (again per 100k) since beginning year even. right elderly, virus spreads like spreads India even non weak people risks life healthcare collapses itself. happened hospital Lombardia NY last year.

Plus India highly populated place virus ""breeding facility"" may impact us too. got J&amp;J back March.

There hundreds slots open right Moderna Pfizer, would happen decided get mRNA vaccine well? told exercise reduced risk death covid?? Educate chip manufacturing chip put vaccine?  governors manage risk people states traveling take advantage loosened restrictions? Israel advantage creating much restrictive border. Difficult make comparisons states factors play. Florida, average terms deaths per capita, straight comparison, Florida decent.  
But bring factors, Florida starts look even better. Two fo biggest factors covid deaths age obesity. Florida one oldest states (5th oldest) California one youngest ( 45th). Florida middle pack terms obesity (35). California one thinnest (48).  


Just taking account two factors, Florida likely looking much better handling it, sacrifice economy, fyi dollars, lot death, disease, etc. associated economic issues, public health issue well.  


In much intense analysis would need take place say state ""better"" another dozens dozens major factors, limited analysis looks like Florida well, even better California. vaccine-hesitant community regardless are. absurd millions doses sitting around unused. They're held they're earmarked Americans eligible signed receive yet. ignorance astounding. It’s even trying more... Oh no, believe vaccines cause sterilization - that's ridiculous. I'm sure could unexpected side effects vaccines know time passed that's one.

I realize impression comment gave - believe vaccines cause meant cause sterilization. vaccinated. responding OP's comment population decline would inherently bad. mean, estimation, matter anyway climate change passed point return planet officially dying really matter relation population control still there's reason add stress already overtaxed ecosystem. Likely due many infected immunity. exactly ray hope book.  Apparently, happened [Germany too. nurse broke mistake vial vaccine hidden mistake replacing saline solution. Edit : typo suppose. Also probably easier pretend everything's going fine prepare worst. European guess expected better us. India basically road US go tribalism lazy truth comes zenith US. might problem people seeing AZ less effective backup two, might increase hesitancy even more. 92% got second? let perfect become enemy good actually it. Tiktok area shows people saying ran tests. Well, vaccine's sent India freebie, purchased us going expire use date... Like stops anyone lol. Pretty much views matter. I’ve always supportive masks since temporary emergency situation saying it’s like shirt comparison seatbelts ludicrous. Wearing shirt seatbelt doesn’t impede non-verbal communication. Masks permanent gaslighting false comparisons imply be. statements still mathematically correct time.

That make less stupid. anything, argument pedantry, makes even *more* stupid. India place needs help unfortunately. wear mask, too. 

The reason asked think mixed messages masking, including requirement wear masks full vaccination, caused many question “what’s use?” responsible vaccine hesitancy. surprising thing learned pandemic international flights cancellation slow &amp; talking almost countries. Rest assured one considering Covid hoax, people dying denial everyone trying best soon recover know Finally good news. Love see support people countries. Well see happened Germany, thought good never plan. I'm kinda upset allowed Brazil get screwed jump India case. 20 million vaccines still 20 million zero vaccines. You’d obviously want focus doses risk exposed due employment, like elderly medical workers, like every country done. 

I agree India’s situation control though quick remedy, whatever done keep medical system complete collapse, seems imminent, done. 

1.4 billion people extreme pressure good thing use. 

The prospect diversionary shooting war somewhere east seems increasing hour. thing might huge sprawling global consequences. 

I’m proponent suspending medical patents COVID vaccines next year so, making possible countries make clones Pfizer Moderna products immediately. Lots saftey issues well I’m sure, consequences seem huge continue ignore. sex. Women two Xs. Cause super partisan, India viewed “pro trump” Modi, Biden Kamala punishing India. Petty ask me. People people, every life matters it’s based science could care less personal opinion.  Terrifying see happens virus rages control. Thanks goodness vaccine.   ignored Brazil they're shit? mean crazy ignore one vs other? could see regionally everything US diverse. think south continue issue. relaxing them. Ri essentially totally normal memorial day. care, another election rally millions soon. mostly talking ass referencing insanely old data (""half nursing care workers rejected ohio"" January).

Current polling data 20% elgible population saying yet. Certain subsets get near 50%, thats going cutting population fairly small like say ""White republican males."" already 350k confirmed cases, stretch imagine actual numbers already beyond 500k He’s going announce reduction restrictions week. don’t think we’ll see bigger reductions restrictions get sustained sub 1000 cases hospitalizations. Whether wear mask isnt matter science really protests US anymore lockdowns places never again. Rural elections r still going on. Govt cancelled them, act new serge next 30-45 days. 1,557 deaths per million 30th 50 states DC, ahead California trailing behind West Virginia. see happening based statistics.  Certain states, sure. US whole.  Maybe early fall hit 60%, children getting vaxed. 70% pipe dream:  government sure know else puts RNA body, known cause myocarditis? guessed it, covid.

Recent studies young athletes showing close 1% developing sort thing covid. That's far higher Israel seeing vaccine. Unless you’re suggesting US sent vaccine supply January today India, nothing could’ve done months leading either. discussion them, indeed fact hanging speaks process getting it.

That wouldnt even occurred months back.

I think reasonable expect people go vigilant anxious ""normal."" sounds like friends aware totally rational emotions, means probably self aware enough make necessary adjustments time. Give break. impediment normality, people getting vaccinated are. Feeling better? It’s pretty simple really. 

I wear cloth mask n95 whatever feel like time, depending exposed others. 

It’s big deal. I’m big baby wear mask getting frogurt. photo news showed boxes UCL Ventura, CPAP-like machine, made consortium various engineering companies F1 teams. think never used various reasons.  it’s concern? think people different definition means. point people it’s end restrictions, indeed near. end actual virus different story. Yup well past point travel restrictions US. That’s necessarily true. take making access easier well. There’s massive underestimate people willing get vaccine it’s made convenient so.

David Holland summed well Tiktok banned India alas, tried nothing we're ideas still lot community spread Indian variant already spreading.

At point travel ban would almost insignificant. of? Google says 5,300 USA. volunteer mass vax site (US) give extra doses (extras go volunteers). I've couple people approach asking extra gently say give pro-tips getting appointments (i.e. time check CVS site, etc.) 

It's definitely embarrassing awkward them-- least try make embarrassing awkward. part masking advice medical experts chosen follow? 

When said masks weren’t necessary 3 months (because scientific consensus COVID), single cloth mask effective, two masks: N95 combined another mask?   second dose days ago effects feeling pretty rough first one - small price pay tho, grateful vaccinated  mRNA based good point. 
We sadly know much multiple variants come. value statistics lives? bet lives units save think gesture merely token. Excellent. hope trend continues. think bigger question this: can’t life return normal everyone risk vaccinated?

Of course, individual free take precautions want. want stay home get vaccine, that’s call. government mandates curfews business closures still warranted? vs. risks? even close! brainer.

And awesome seems turned way ***know*** could serious. Pausing use vaccine absolutely, 100%, right thing do. we're confident benefits outweigh risk, get back using J&amp;J vaccine.

This leadership following advice qualified experts.

This system working. FYI, actually covid impacts whole world People super pissed, things hardly balck white social media Intellects would tell you.

After first wave over, things went pretty smooth time everyone mistook end-game.

There new strain spreads quickly, called double mutation causing huge spike cases health facilities prepare.

Government busy rallies stop religious gatherings due elections.

People got lazy, stopped wearing maak ( say 30% population ), started partying/visiting mass gathering events.

Even inital spike, people thought settle pretty fast.


Basically, round chaos.

But everyone blaming government, because... well else blame?  still getting Pfizer without doubt last alinea. Covid risk higher. kidding, trying keep sense humor things

Also know USA lifting ban exports. Happy help usa Saudi Arabia providing Finally! Thank you. emergency help what?

Well, ask me, ask government(s):  German Defense Ministry said assessing possibility providing m**obile oxygen generator medical equipment**.  US will ""immediately"" send **supplies raw materials needed make vaccines, well therapeutics, tests, ventilators protective equipment** to India, the White House said a statement Sunday.  already coordinating EU MS ready provide urgently needed **&amp; medicine** rapidly.  longtime rival, also offered deliver **medical supplies** following recent thaw relations nuclear-armed neighbors.  UK, meanwhile, said sending more **600 pieces of medical equipment** India, including **ventilators and oxygen concentrators.**  said plans support India **oxygen capacity** next days, Russia also pledged assist India sending **medical equipment**. 

&amp;#x200B;

All Works better longer gap means protect people seems worthwhile Hope put heavy controls quarantaine incoming visitors India limit transmission double mutant Europe. i've read, even vaccinated, still carry without getting sick pass on. I'm doctor, i'm sure true is. hope also bit pessimistic. news coming India true, heading catastrophe. Help abroad mitigate it, afraid drop ocean. Really really hoping wrong.  Speaking india - 

Friendship USA ❌
Saudi Arabia best friend 🤝 thought story great. I’ll follow Twitter. Thought great job breaking natural, anticipated part mass vaccinations reason panic 1,333,756 first doses today versus 1,753,367 last Sunday. Rolling average continuing fall rapid pace, 1,247,276 last 7 days versus 1,307,221 yesterday lowest 2 months. know wearing masks time, told two weeks second shot could unmasked around vaccinated people. That's big enough since means finally see family friends year. think misread post, misread pdf, too! 20-29 age group increased 5.1 31, increase 25.9, 503%. looking age group. 18-59 group, hospitalizations approx. 36 266 now. increasing age groups, disproportionately affecting younger groups. whatever's going on, hitting younger people harder used to.

If project exponentially, pandemics, sort increase quite troubling. need figure going nationwide phenomenon, ways mitigate risks.  I'm drinking fuck water isnt helping much. Pedialyte. agree this. Even people personally know took seriously eventually started rationalize things - “oh well I’m going places meet standard”, “oh I’m hanging people like me”, “well I’m wearing mask this”. know 12-year old extremely unlikely severe disease. she’s also interested getting even mild case, modeling responsible behavior doesn’t want get anyone else sick. whole family together we’re vaccinated, we’re cool licking doorknobs again. glad parents well- sorry grandmother. understand feeling! daughter ill covid terrified. used set alarm check breathing too. worry, ""too much""
 something none us ever forget! [The Latest: US pledges medical aid India combat surge - ABC News Bosnia 5th highest number deaths per capita world (3rd, exclude microstates).

Relative size country, Bosnia's outbreak 50% worse US Brazil.

Given countries deaths Bosnia getting ahead terms vaccination (Hungary one best continental Europe respect), looks like Bosnia could end worst world. yourself, protect others.

For example, encounter someone covid. exposed could transmit others even though vaccinated. understanding, less common transmission occur vaccinated unvaccinated people, still possible.

Here's analogy: someone else peanut allergy. wear gloves protect peanut butter. scoop finger rub person. able put danger even though protected. 60% people aged 50-64 partially vaccinated, days 50% people 40-49 won’t. children will. following guy @NasirKhuehami Delhi, ton look around. also search hashtags #SOS, #Oxygen, #OxygenShortage

In regards girl, original tweet deleted, got hospital: guy helped died:  population density insane

For us states, imagine 1 million square mile New Jersey.  That's many people crammed there. Absolutely agree. Infectious diseases way list ways mankind go extinct. provide total tests administered. compare previous day divide confirmed cases difference. following guy @NasirKhuehami Delhi, ton look around. also search hashtags #SOS, #Oxygen, #OxygenShortage

In regards girl, original tweet deleted, got hospital: guy helped died: 520k* theory should, never really know happens behind closed doors.

Still hope COVID-19 known cause myocarditis. 

If higher rate myocarditis isreal year, think would far likely COVID caused rather vaccine. 

Myocarditis is, commonly caused viral infection. ? feel like trying begin with. basically million dollar question right now, believe there's dataset yet conclusively answers question. study couple months ago showed AZ vs. B1.351 little better placebo preventing symptomatic infection. one study died, sample composition primarily healthy young people - able draw generalizable conclusions true effectiveness AZ S. African strain pertained hospitalizations death.

I'm expecting/hoping there'll data next couple months puts question rest. AZ significantly mitigates hospitalization death S. African strain, fact show symptoms overly problematic outside risk spread unvaccinated. shown there's significant hit efficacy hospitalization/death front well symptomatic infection, likely prolong pandemic boosters development arrive, particularly jurisdictions heavy AZ footprint.

So particularly juncture, jury still hopefully we'll know soon. can't find percentage positive day, point it?  post removed cannot verify reliable source. Twitter sources may reliable. possible, please re-submit link reliable source (i.e. news article).

Vaccines question. require 1-2 months take effect assuming ad absurdum DE take doses away people, ship tomorrow &amp; magically distribute blink eye. 

Ventilators (the kind requires intubation) pretty much useless. I'm Romania. 2nd world terms health care. lot hospitals RO fatality rate need intubated 90%+. lots ICUs doctors ultra-depressed RARELY seen someone recover intubated. West fatality rate ~40% intubated. difference comes quality health care. much prompt attention &amp; intervention given critical patient makes difference 4 10 dead vs. 9+ 10 dead. can't ship quality health care India that's also question.

Finally, O2 important concrete item that's missing hospitals that's prohibitively expensive ship. needs manufactured on-site hospitals either necessary installations not. can't ship O2 India amounts make difference. 

So... emergency help what? plans influenza, cancer, accidental death, etc. kill kids much higher frequencies COVID19? It’s like mask final authority proof I’m decent thoughtful human.

That's future vaccine rollout, people get looking convenience. Filling prescriptions? Getting flu shot? checkup? teeth cleaning? Eye doctor? ER visit? Might well throw covid shot well. Issue expats cannot come back US. Biden still keeping Trump's absurd travel bans.  Really hope applies Canada, too. dying visit folks August. California kicking ass. Thankful living here.  likely type vaccination rate UK outstanding. Maybe future regional outbreaks around country people get motivated get vaccinated. take time.

I keep waiting follow-up middle aged adults Puntmann study suggesting like people end heart damage covid, regardless severity. fact almost year nothing else come supporting suggesting they're finding much, maybe waiting long time get N high enough kind meaningful statistical significance...well, that's hope least. Exactly- hope cousin makes full recovery soon possible! Modi cocksuckers hail great victory India, despite fact central government 100% fault deaths hundreds thousands Yea making less less sense time  get J&amp;J. One dose lower efficiency protects severe disease hospitalization. It’s one done. Also Moderna, made vaccine ever covid. AZ lacked enormous amount leadership, fucked trials enormously, fucked production enormously fucking enormously logistics agree more. That's important lots countries bit, whether manafacturing things, donating, sending medical teams, oxygen etc. We're different stages pandemic think there's something nations help without compromising home efforts fight virus. Especially world relies India vaccine manafacturing. everyone's interest help right now, least something huge humanitarian scale unlike Czechia. That's good hear, India's biggest problem incompetent leadership sizable portion public refuses abide basic pandemic precaution like masking social distancing. make matters worse, know there's media blackout domestically comes criticizing covering bad pandemic situation ensure pandemic grows worse worse. concern world India's dense massive population likely creating new viral variants like wildfire. Worst case scenario variant makes existing vaccine formulations largely ineffective. Good luck tackling anti-vax narratives then. average north american  reason CDC recommends masks vaccinated people right enforceability. ""we know vaccines prevent transmission,"" that's noble lie. vaccine uptake craters, costs vaccine hesitancy outweigh benefits getting unvaccinated people wear masks strong political pressure change guidance. full FDA approval hope colleges public schools (elementary/High school/etc) mandate vaccination. would definitely help lot. Also would nice private businesses require employees full FDA approval. I'm sure kinds lawsuits. safe wash fruits produces dish detergent? understanding family member mine nonstop would listen evidence against, do? Young population sort double-edged sword imo.

Young means average person going suffer much. Young also means average person might lax precautions since believe suffer much.

I hope Indians saw happened us States took note. last thing world needs India become United States 2.0 spawn dozen variants cursed virus.  Heck, saw enough examples people want kind change year ago. lots examples people deny COVID-19, think hoax.

I'm all-but-resigned idea we'll getting boosters quite while. apologies. Sounded like thinly-veiled antivax statement initially me, wrong.  Wow wow wow needs upvoted heaven. pumped Holy crap huge news!!!!! really affect it? harassing that's another story. idea happens. mobile time I’m posting don’t know matters. always post archive link paywalled articles. Cases rising 70% week. Every previous time rise happened anywhere, they've gotten control and, worst, cases started falling essentially 2 weeks hospitals sounded alarm freaked everyone out. happen infections keep rising herd immunity coasted past large percentage population infected, presumably time. India large country, happen simultaneously everywhere. Presumably ability test would exceeded cases would cap 20-50% testing capacity within state.

[Example India draw line see they'd month behavior change.

[Very similar example Bangladesh what's likely happen.

[Oh hey look human right enter US apply asylum explicitly states UN refugee charter. Yes, that! didn’t know word it. cousins getting covid home still experiencing side effects, even says vaccine comes it’ll crazy rushes development (or lack of). track impoverished? There’s much corruption already prevent loss/damage vaccines too? sounds really difficult even accomplish 21 person outbreak Saskatchewan, Canada due outdoor event, think extremely transmittable variant Hopefully get 50% total population ages 16+ alone.

Yeah see means 16+ figures gave 18+, ask total population, asked total eligible population. Studies revealed prevalent strain surge India UK strain UK, amount fucking morons see walking around mask covering mouth nose staggering. Honestly don’t know HIT don’t really care. ~60% immune clearly powerful effect towards reducing local transmission. county California predicts could get 85% eligible vaccinated, would incredible. hope areas low uptake spread rural regions. I’d love nothing require vaccination, since can’t that, I’ll take get short term. 

Epidemiologically speaking, could well major cities international connections “walled off” vaccine uptake, won’t matter hinterland doesn’t high. There’s lot reason cautious optimism right United States. public health worker, plan worst, good scenarios likelier even relatively low vaccine uptake. lot different forms aid though. certainly understand Germany might want give away vaccines they're still close majority population vaccinated Germany extra oxygen ventilators used lending India might save lot lives. aid done strategically reduce Indian deaths without compromising German abilities fight Covid meaningful way. - 69.4%

Dammit, 80% like 2 weeks ago. immunity vaccinations last, either. one tell us exactly long. outside without mask always risky since know protected are, long. still need masks cases dwindling nothing. person telling us common sense wear mask outdoors asshole told us March 2020 need wear masks all. Dutch government great website, Netherlands countries see similar numbers relative population size: US hope enough colleges mandate vaccines get youth motivated enough get shot. Realistically going ones slacking, let's whatever takes get shots arms.  That’s total population though, 18+. cases undercounted. According India Times positivity rate tests Kolkata 50%. Delhi, 30%. does. them. science works; smaller cohorts yield initial numbers, revised time goes people studied.

Young people absolutely taking covid seriously trying avoid even small chance (because 1 100 small IMO) get unlucky. 

As permanent, myocarditis variable outcomes. gamble it. Comparatively speaking, yes. 55 much younger demographic originally hardest hit Covid. people UK second shot (by design) basically beat virus B117 spreading. 80% 1, 90+% 2 durability. Yes, I'd recommend getting both, 1 much much better none. India probably way bigger capacity produce stuff somewhere like England. why? 

Thats gonna help clean reputation... long ruled monarchy (especially monarchy executes people) never considered anything primitive country ruled brutality.    Thank answering! believe entering work, company arrange requisite paperwork much easier show proof ""legit"" reason enter. lived too, entry abroad strictly controlled foreigners must apply approval (likely arranged part full dad's employers malaysia.) I'll applying entirely independently outside 

Im hoping attaching letter explaining situation, I'm fully vaccinated time travel, house car mixing population relying taxis shared accomodation etc help. I'm doubtful. I'm applying outside Malaysia would entering regular ""tourist"" visa right live work there, I'm doubtful I'll given permission enter. hope explaining situation ways reduce interaction risk Malaysian citizens (isolating away, driving car, meeting lawyers outside etc) enough. 

I Malay friends returned posting hotel quarantine. looks pretty civilised asfar staying room week goes. Nasi lemak delivered would help course! Variants harder kids og flavor. Hopefully encouragement people yet vaccinated yet US, especially parts world start announcing similar plans. wonder post get upvotes lets-shit-on-murica do. 🤔 fast making new vaccines though? Well 3 million day I'll bet.

Sending 20-40 million doses India right could potentially contain limit huge 4th wave. need give people tangible benefit. Cause point view, think high risk Covid getting shot changes nothing. close relationship different question whether US ""dibs"" vaccine, conflating different arguments Let live ignorance. Justin, Justin, ask knows what's store! American I’m totally you. understand Biden put US first think almost country would done supply limited we’re point US convince young healthy adults get vaccinated countries people 70 desperately want vaccine can’t get it. US states already using vaccines vaccinate non US citizens live within state. Lifting vaccine export ban won’t mean 0 vaccines Americans mean lot people get life saving treatment. Biden promised 200 million doses first 100 days delivered goal I’m hoping day 101 (a week today) lifts ban. Hey, least CDC admitting now. thought would take much longer say vaccinated people aren’t transmitters. Yeah killing thousands people every year including ~200 kids US. mean might fine that's great.

Were ever consciously upset January 2020? I'm sure demand waned, underestimate people's desire single shot ""traditional vaccine.""

Look NYT chart doses type. Pfizer Moderna vaccines barely moved nearly rise fall explained J&amp;J doses many sites shifted supply, anecdotally know tons folks insist getting either mRNA J&amp;J one. Buffalo, yeah. Thank you. sure many times read people pretend efficacy much change catch COVID. 

There’s zero reason still wearing masks. I’ll give month month half walk appointments available courteous neighbors I’m done it. Thank saying this. I've saying roughly thing months, nice sanity check people see badly CDC fucks up.

I honestly hope Biden tosses entire CDC senior staff door moment pandemic over, forces serious reforms place. I'm sure could fucked worse tried. There's serious bodycount associated too.

Left comments thread details fuckups interested, I'm sure know gist. Glad hear it! Well first plenty people can’t get it. Second off, loud yet super Large group actively vaccines. There’s also group resistant vaccine made quickly. There’s also sizable group probably sees much hassle combination 
-I don’t need I’m risk Covid
-it doesn’t stop spreading covid
-it’s gonna symptoms horrible everyone symptoms it
-it’s inconvenient go get 
So people think “I don’t gain real benefits I’m fine without dealing downsides” dumb things incorrect dont want it, it’s fine long doesn’t prevent others going back normal. Lastly, there’s group probably would take made extremely easy required college work don’t really wanna actively seek don’t see many huge direct benefits it. Thank you, learned something you. never used wonder things virus got interested. Yeah I’m mentality. I’ll wear mask wherever needed things I’m I’m allowed without mask. I’m going concert damn mask. Buffalo downstate? Buffalo surrounding areas seem pretty high kind mirror Ontario/Michigan much lower level. 

However, cases significantly state whole especially metro NYC area 32% decrease past 14 days average. 

So short answer long answer, cases still relatively high definitely surge. tribalism problem US (conservative vs liberal). large % people's views based ""side"" (few think independently).  Interestingly, anti-vaxism primarily left position past, reason Trumpism taken position covid vaccine.  think part overall world view covid overblown, government used restrict liberty, etc etc. Many take extreme large conspiracy covid vaccine.  still socially distance wear mask vaccinated? pointless comparison. huge percentage deaths Spanish Flu secondary bacterial infections - antibiotics exist 1928. middle World War information (particularly cause death) entirely unreliable. mention, entire countries throughout Asia, Africa South America virtually ZERO accurate data.

There's reason mortality estimates Spanish Flu varry 50m+...because nobody clue. Bush fought AIDS Africa built large pandemic strategic reserve. got used H1N1 definitely saw something saying early results looking extremely promising.

I really think mRNA vaccines could fairly quickly remove infectious disease. delivery vehicle worked out, based fast Moderna figured covid vaccine, tailoring particular disease probably hard.

Though wouldn’t enjoy half dozen rounds mRNA shots, given sick second one made me. I’d it, man would suck. entry exceptions US border restrictions, notably student visas others. Indian/american passport holder always able travel city insisted would 4 months day earlier. line feds intended. easy enough look data. sharply past 2 weeks. Really? CDC lying constantly whole crisis, finally admit glaringly obvious, get skeptical? wasnt hoping US would force hands. hoping indias people would start fighting corruption force government change.

Kind like think trumps coronavirus response tipping point getting voted out. Sometimes people learn hard way deaths change happen. Better nothing!! know ppl friends give vaccinated breast milk give kids lol (ew also genius?) may economic reasons countries want avoid shut downs simply valid economic reason large scale political rallies held. Holding maskless political rally without social distancing pandemic literal embodiment party putting needs country. No, position several months behind be, they've happily lied public truly stupid reason, time refusing say ""we're extremely confident this"" without half dozen studies.

The CDC case study organization failure scientists policy makers spokesmen.

There ton giving public easy advice based evidence (ie sanitize everything) refusing give difficult expensive advice based initial evidence basic common sense.

For example, every coronavirus airborne. absence info covid-19 spreads, reasonable person would say ""we believe airborne need info confirm"" advise shutting things, moving stuff outside, improving ventilation, people wear masks, etc.

But expensive, bleaching shit constantly cheap easy. I'll bet death toll piece stupid mid six figures. find breath-taking people still understand basic premises ""cough"" big fucking deal spreads large number people without balance measures place. like watching train wreck. knew going horrible kept getting worse. even click shit? Yeah killing thousands people every year including \~200 kids US. mean might fine that's great.

If COVID becomes even those. I'm saying forever shut everything something, definitely problem, especially rural hospitals struggle every winter people really sick flu. Yeah, mean things opening obviously that’s gonna lead Covid stuff, vaccination rates started come play we’re good. job test positive symptoms even you’re vaccinated need quarantine ten days symptoms regardless go away ten days up. guidelines county health department county. covid surging ny atm? Anecdotally noticing lots new infections among folks know, wondering there's larger trend. got lucky already head start SARS vaccine 10 years ago, otherwise we'd years out.

Really? impression sequencing mRNA used Pfizer Moderna shots nothing original SARS vaccines. source talks that?  might honestly... say 1 20,000 know least 5% due vaccine effectiveness? Exactly. hope choice mandate going forward hope anyone chooses year round isn’t looked weird. I’m fine injecting ghk considering dna repair functions Indiana. Lots non believers flat refuse vaccine. We've working AIDS vaccine decades without success. would absolutely wonderful mRNA crack it, I'll believe see it.   certainty given uniquely awkward HIV is, Moderna developing vaccine (think still preclinical trials). know mRNA vaccine HIV ever attempted before, somehow works final boss pretty much game infectious disease know it. Proteolytic enzymes like serrapeptase also effectively deal fibrinogen usually need enteric coating effective orally administered ways. understand syntax (and grammar) child, since don’t believe child, I’m left assume you’re simply uneducated, would explain, know, everything.  feel like I’m going insane trying get people get stuff, stuff I’ve literally saying months.

For reason people can’t grasp don’t need perfect vaccine, one gets R 1 keeps there. point, problem solved itself. We're going 70% adults vaccinated July. US UK got headstart, we're probably going finish around time. agree. feel like pretty optimistic humans general this, lot gone thanks watching people refuse wear mask skip gatherings. trust institutions entirely gone; feel like told whatever convenient would reopen things (such “having social distancing cramped, poorly ventilated classrooms a-ok!”), rather told actually safe. general world feels like darker place pandemic. Agree. sure downvoted. And, no, criticizing CDC terrible communications ""spreading anti vax narrative"". communication messaging disaster throughout pandemic. I’m sure Reddit became mouth piece India. know better expect charity United States.

Just FYI india threatened sanctions US government stopped exporting HCQ last year. suppose “forcing hands” must thing guys. Either way, there’s gotta better message “vaccinated people still need follow COVID guidelines” clearly evidence 6 feet distancing... later changed 3 feet... later challenged MIT study showed people 60 feet safer. Yet CDC publishes recommendation nonetheless. require hard science recommendations... except don't. probably adult since immunity estimated wane ~7 years. bother testing adults usually less dangerous us. offense people Kentucky . seems southern states wouldn’t taken vaccine anyways , regardless incentives . Maybe we’d see different outcome communities vaccine-hesitant would willing take vaccine they’re informed effectively . I’m seeing lot people Los Angeles taking vaccine get inside Dodger games. agree. Easy. always go lowest risk choice.

You say ""oh 0.1% 0.01% death matter. Let's go highest risk death"". 

Like wtf. That's plain stupid.

Same reason fly 737 max even though never crashes US. Sure, geologists making report conference, wait definite results.

Given fast moving rapidly changing crisis, waiting month definitely right much worse making decision now, info confident in.

It's like general issue orders perfect information enemy happening. end sitting there, people they're supposed lead get slaughtered.

Hmm, actually exactly like that. lot blood CDC's hands dumber box rocks.   You’re qualified come conclusion anything, understand frustration. stop spending much time people agree you, dulling effect. submission removed because

If believe made mistake, please [message moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/Coronavirus&amp;subject=Removed submission&amp;message=I'm writing following submission: absolutely agree. many tragic miscommunications virus one worst.

The CDC published study making point weeks ago, Walensky said ""data suggests"" vaccinated people can't spread it, walked back days later. ample evidence real-world studies Israel Fauci can't embrace it. like one on-again, off-again romance movies totally obvious keep missing other.

Fauci takes hard line requiring scientific evidence certain things makes recommendations scientific backing. says see evidence finally admitting vaccinated people can't spread virus. recommends masks, 6 feet distance, restrictions science supporting iffy best. throws percentages herd immunity place, anywhere 60% 90%, admitting number gives intended convince people rather backed science.

I understand he's trying good job difficult situation become hard take serious gives critics ammo every time speaks public. Pfizer close relationship US? Well, since US business friendly policies decades. know, things Europeans criticized US having. Unless variants keep popping Provaxxers hate preliminary investigation...  Spain really confusing moment. case numbers actually tenth best Europe, yet hospitality open while, even inside. Yes, there's weather, also hit really hard previous waves. Heck maybe bhakts convince people fault Muslims Modi thing holding back even worse situation. least get around 60-65% , maybe rest don’t want take vaccine get immunity natural means. potentially still get around 70-80% may need . Damn I’m talking people they’re numbers ... could imagine people making decisions feel.  calculated risk CDC announced investigation. 

Your calculation based incomplete data.

It could gone way(low chance, course), luckily doesn't. acquaintance says exactly that. doesn’t mask up. lives mom elderly overweight. SMH. also believes stupid shit like alkaline water crap. Literally first rule crisis communications never lie public, always backfires.

The public health world gleefully lying public way through, keep astounded keeps backfiring.

Seriously, communicate complex true instead going simple lie falls apart minute's scrutiny. country learning survivorship bias hard way US developing nation (or I've assured). Yeah that's happens invest 20 billion dollars vaccines top scientists pharmaceutical companies working it. 

Good thing Canada chose partner China CanSino got... nothing it. lost weight thats cus stopped eating lol  don’t see would expect better food access gap, basic medical care access gap, iPhone access gap, etc. Nothing global economic system set guarantee basic necessities poor people poor countries, many issues important vaccines.

I’m justifying gaps. seems completely unsurprising.  Good know. happened tested positive close contact positive cases? must quarantined otherwise overall situation cannot turned around. virus negotiate cut slacks. 

On hand virus rather predictable. individual level thing works discipline: lock everyone in, let guards down, wait till crisis dissipates. Every single person responsible safety whole family. single breach could ruin everyone. 

Good luck. Canadian nationalism got claiming without lipids, many countries produce way, would mRNA vaccines huh. Hold on, second source say contagious original strain (as originally claimed), probably contagious generally-accepted-as-more-contagious-than-the-original-one UK variant. increased contagion given contributing factor areas surges concomitant variant's newfound dominance. even contagious variant, good thing, means mean contagious original. missing something?


(No argument coming largely mismanagement, course.) Except Facui entirely happy knowingly lie people masks working early on, obviously futile attempt preserve medical mask supply chain.

At point, Fauci scientist. He's policy maker spokesman, astoundingly bad it.

In crisis, rarely get make decisions perfect information. like said, vaccine blocking transmission always far likely outcome.

But instead pushing message ""the vaccine almost certainly blocks transmission, we're waiting data totally sure, earlier results suggest..."" pushed message perfectly reasonable well intentioned people believing vaccine block transmission, handed huge weapon anti vaxxers.

The costs fuckup increased vaccine hesitancy might difference herd immunity not. costs earlier lies dumb decisions, like masks refusing say airborne, measured hundreds thousands lives.

A scientist's perspective caution terrible way make policy crisis.

Hopefully public health world learn lessons this, fire senior people, bungle things badly next time. guess they'll instead congratulate spend next years wanking awards book deals. I've worked people considered weakness changed opinion new evidence became available.

They pleasant people deal with. Take look \- lots appointments available state Exported vaccines save lifes. That's weird thing pissed about. mean sure, it’s still shaping like nothing fun going allowed 2022, least, fucking sucks. Yea mass political rallies election masks. Fuck everything. shit show. learnt dad tested positive India. scared mom. help. sibling live different parts world, alone. Yes much much much likely spread covid others vaccinated much much much likely get permanent organ damage covid even don’t die don’t get vaccine vs getting vaccine.

Do understand probability works? Israel shown vaccinating adults protects children  pot shot, question. truly understand Canada managed position compared US event. Obviously impression health system better Canada now.

I think misunderstood question sort ideological attack, isn't, feel explanations shed much light current situation me. Tell you’re pro big pharma, you’re pro people living. 550,000 fellow Americans dead. Don’t mince words. favourite reaction far, TV host trained paramedic Tobias Schlegel:

# actors shove irony deep intubator think many businesses/event planners afraid first. like businesses removing mask mandates, type thinking stick around they're absolutely sure plan stuff blow back.

I agree, super sucks. vaccine pretty widely available couple months everyone opportunity get fully vaccinated. can't keep waiting refuse get it. Pakistani here, currently third wave due UK variant prevalent country. However, general population careless since cases low. Currently we’re reporting around 5k cases per day around 120-150 reported deaths per day. government imposed strict restrictions fully imposed lockdown, case cases keep rising they’re considering full lockdown let’s see. Pakistani population 220m 3 major metropolitan cities rushing get ahead virus becomes problem. currently vaccinating 60-64 age groups Sinopharm vaccine supplies slow coming in. Sputnik V available privately supplies aren’t consistent either. Overall it’s bad India right hope control spread it’s pretty scary going lie woulda US Trump election. infections, despite discomfort necessarily bad thing. truly delusional ones still afraid life vaccinated. Damn, really put perspective long it’s been. Anyone birthday March spent two birthdays pandemic, crazy think things well Same. want bang head wall figured yet. I'm totally pro-vax. 2nd Pfizer yesterday. way people going seek J&amp;J what's happened regards clotting issues regardless odds. know incredibly rare, choice, would pick J&amp;J point? Honestly. Man hope I'm wrong here..... difference US 20 million AZ doses even using since approved. Biden's covid advisor publically said never use them. Let's deflect - US unethical fuck. 99 percent chance surviving car crash seatbelt id probably ok wearing less though

And even fauci says still get Covid vaccine spread pharmacy (military) gives option skip pages drug info first fill. years asking keep paperwork waited time. don’t think though. rare get brain; lot filtration go through, namely lungs. Also consider sinus brain venous, meaning even go. lot surgeons noted extreme hypercoagulability, visible surgery, labs showed almost complete drop platelets.thewe highly unusual phenomenon, albeit rare vaccinated individuals. country fails incompetent, blame US try guilt-trip giving vaccines

So responding random comment Reddit constitutes guilt-tripping entire nation? God love website go ahead, take sniffles. believe not, 1 2 pharmacies slots within 15 miles live pretty much proves supply issue rather demand means pharmacies booked out. compare situation say, portland, podunk town mississippi thats difference supply bottleneck demand one logic behind it. Republican politicians told base Covid doesn’t exist, would vaccinate something doesn’t exist? they’re told. hey, least pandemic socially over. Ok, I'll look those.

He rely professional PR team, quite obvious. Still, need Canadian vaccines, stage results promising. MRNA vaccine production capacity would also important cancer care vaccines. ""exploring"". already loaned Mexico Canada. Biden said looking loaning given timeline. still 20 million doses AZ gathering dust all, covid advisor said they'll never use. gone way beyond ""America first"" immorality. Let us know Canada’s “research” contributes anti-Covid vaccines. anyone know vaccines going approved general use (ie. emergency use) US? Get vaccine. protects serious potentially permanent symptoms protects others around getting virus spread contract it.

And like ‘absolutely point’ stance doesn’t really make sense me. still die car accent even wear seatbelt there’s absolutely point wearing one doesn’t protect 100%? submission linking thepointsguy.com automatically removed source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* feel like studies saying wide swath activities perfectly safe much confidence. cases continuing pace that's frankly surprising given significant chunk vaccinated. *are* cases spreading at? every respiratory virus known man spread easily schools, evidently COVID doesn't? Lots posts /r/CanadaCoronavirus - quite people collection links founder's shenanigans non-stop press tour asking money. Several.

A/H1N1 (the influenza virus caused ""Spanish Flu"") probably famous. HCoV-OC43 (the human coronavirus likely caused ""Russian Flu"") probably relevant. wise. precipitous drop platelets well. unusual. Contracts rewritten parties agree it. something explored? check making fair comparison? difference preventing symptomatic disease vs preventing infection? see spotters. There's appointments within 15 miles everyone. Everyone wants one America first shot end month. get then, either want can't bothered rush want easy walk (which May everywhere) know DC still bit rough lot people going MD VA anyway, especially rural areas. god you’re stubbornly incorrect People take anti-intellectual positions like anti-vaccination usually capable changing opinions based evidence. It’s honest truth. wouldn’t worry much. That’s leaving 20 yr history government funding. headline another misleading one. 1 shot mrna effectiveness better J&amp;J mainly clinical trials data, never fair compare efficacy numbers given administered different times different variants going around. UK good studies showing 1 shot Pfizer vs 1 shot AZ head head (since two vaccines using there) showed 1 shot AZ actually slightly effective Pfizer, 1 shot Pfizer closer ~60% effectiveness 14 days, 80% shown clinical trials. studies elsewhere well shown 1 shot Pfizer effective clinical trials. might rise late may point might 4 weeks away 30s able get different vaccine. Remember risk/reward balance drastically shifts based long expect delay peoples vaccination give AZ. graph government presented az causing ICU admissions covid 30s low covid incidence **16 week** period iirc. 

The balance shifts lot government becomes aware novavax becoming available soon based knowledge modernas delivery timeline is. Remember AZ supply pretty limited well, especially many second doses still need give az, good chance would literally save week two allowing az 30s I’m anti vax means. I’m 30. immune system. work weight. It’s crazy question taking mRNA vaccine thing poses little threat. older close family vaccinated I’m happy it. still get Covid it, looks like can, see absolutely point. we’re talking vaccines helped decades government funded research. article bunch sht. ""If precautions taken"". single school area know done anything improve ventilation. 

The disclaimer allows lies spread cause would bet barely schools take enough precautions. places oregon, massachusetts, california, etc name read Bangladesh strict lockdown. Need movement passes.

While flights controlled, land borders India open... True fda considered gold standard usa nowhere close fully vaccinated ourselves, 

2/3 total population vaccinated already vaccinated. Demand dropped precipitously. First dose demand dropped 50% peak. US stockpiling vaccines never use millions. Whatever logic using line reality. US too. 

The Pfizer concentrate needs mixed causing happen. 

A US prison medic opposite forgot put saline gave 6x dose prisoners. said people dying due covid. dying due lack oxygen 

It's like saying one dies cause except lack oxygen brain. Yes officer, shot actually died dire lack oxygen.

Covid causes complications cause death. Pre-existing complications increase likelihood. Deniers generally use latter point gleefully point *but die covid! heart attack!*

Not saying denier, saying lack infra, covid, killing people common denier tactic. could also stop blocking countries making vaccines. We’re talking Covid here. One closest friends surgeon. *literally* epidemiologist. pay either eat indoors right now. Why? community spread still high. state sitting 13% positivity rate (and recently climbing, despite vaccine rollout). small hospital constant 15 people hospitalized COVID patients, level weeks. I'm ""staying inside"", things safely. I'm jumping back life like vaccine boolean toggle instantly puts end community spread *I it*. daughter get vaccine months. Again, caring people myself. community spread reflects virus remission area (OR child get vaccine), problem returning normal life. attitude I'm germaphobe hermit loves staying home is, word, bullshit.

Everyone different; care want go eat pretend pandemic over, anyone thinks is, living utter delusion denial. what? One year ago supply chain horrific couldn’t get sort medical equipment needed. watching number states actually passed laws issued orders this. Lmao ulcer years, weight doesnt always correlate heartburn, underweight coughing blood moment US still far worst affected COVID. Still 3x deaths India despite fraction population India. India likely surpass us already begun sharing doses shift soon. Helping India everyone’s interest, potential variants such. We’re working it. US really isn’t anything crazy here. Where?

That true high demand areas 10 days ago, there's plenty appointments NYC, LA, Chicago, etc. now. ACIP meeting yesterday, range 6-15 says. found case 15 days vaccination. Obviously chances clear 13 days still high, wanted point 15 days. Even wasn't, case numbers per capita right crazy India, Brazil, *France* (France Brazil higher India). Going right tourist seems kinda shortsighted.  Poor countries looking 0.2% vaccination. Many may start vaccinating 2024. vaccine going taken immune system immune system repressed. I'm pretty sure US opened land borders would easily vaccinate million mexicans canadians weekend, Biden needs something It’s pretty much scientifically impossible overrun hospitals level vaccination. HFCS chemically equivalent sucrose time hits small intestine. I'll buy increased added sugar intake contributor, think really matters whether added sugar comes table sugar HFCS.

Yes, society we're stupid enough market sugar sweetened beverages, breakfast cereals, desserts children. Got second dose yesterday. first dose worse I’ve already virus second shot could serve booster got second shot Pfizer Thursday afternoon. I've side effects beyond slightly sore arm injection site able 17 mile hike Friday without issues. Today (Saturday) completely side effect free well. Shoot I’m 29 years old every day struggle shit. Lockdown tough obviously semi-open state things kinda normal still totally normal even worse ways. exactly right. Indian coworkers last April: “police hit people sticks go outside.”

My Indian coworkers September: “yeah went 500 person wedding weekend without wearing mask...” one travel business that's suggesting. Zoom. variant journalism often sensationalized, careful read quote.

Absence evidence evidence absence. variant identified recently, would hard accurately determine transmissible deadly quickly.

It's like many officials scientists beginning OG outbreak said ""we evidence spread person-to-person"" ""we evidence airborne"". statements might true time, saying ""we solid evidence one way yet.""  Curious long EUA 12-15 year olds take. 3 approved vaccines took ~1 month maybe mid-May? 

Anything drive percentage population vaccinated help, especially hesitancy becoming prevalent. wish ""help us allow everyone safe getting vaccine"" effective idea. Kind hard give public health guidance appeals selfish motives. Last read, USA produce 40 something million vaccines week. 20 day stock pile plus ability make \~24 million vaccines every 3 days. Theyre getting point theyre trouble finding people stick. could (and should) afford giving vaccines countries point. least start allowing export medical materials countries like India point People going hate it, mask wearing social distancing permanent fixture public life. worth lives saved.   I'm advocating Indians die. I'm saying dying already happened inevitably continue cause corrupt government. hope learning hard way saying hope least silver lining misery. Kind like wish people die US Trump glad people least wisened enough vote out.

And I've said multiple times support giving unused vaccines India. I'm advocating keeping vacinnes away from. Them. saying want US paying them. We've got much debt is. Let Dia carry debt. EU gotten every vaccine they've paid for

*looks AstraZeneca* Case counts hardly scientific depend much testing done. events risk-averse.  one single example silly common supposition hold is.  Multiple reasons:

1. People anti-vaxx general
2. People swayed politics (even though Trump talking vaccine Fox)
3. People want government tell do
4. People nervous think tested thoroughly enough long enough determine long-term effects people understand risk change people get vaccinated. country like India right now, even vaccinated, decent chance infection. Israel California, risk someone fully vaccinated minimal. Hence part get vaxed. European, fine current situation. ramp-up slow, partly due AstraZeneca failing deliver schedule partly due EU investing nearly enough manufacturing, things looking good.

Vaccines finally coming large amounts thanks Pfizer BioNTech. One parents getting first dose Sunday, eligible starting next week. 60-64 age span.

In situation support exporting doses. soon finished vaccinating risk groups, point virus nearly serious anymore. already seeing positive effect vaccinations - even cases high, deaths much lower previous waves. think wait vaccinating every adult starting help others. global pandemic many places desperately needing doses *right now*.

As healthy young person, gladly wait couple extra months vaccine let risk groups heavily affected countries get earlier. America blocking rest world producing vaccines.... VACCINES EXIST WITHOUT MONEY Fully 'Pfizered' yesterday afternoon. Hot damn! Arm feels like played 'frogger' best bud cares.... look week week comparison first shots, daily average dropped like 300k. Apparently Grandad fought Afghanistan WW1. brought back really cool sword swapped cigarettes. Sad never got meet him. US consumes large % commodities. varies commodity commodity. Opiods one best examples. US consumes 80% opiods world, leaving nations nothing. Peru, many countries cancer patients given Tylenol die. wonder could affecting sense smell. COVID back January completely lost sense smell, got back one month after. second dose Moderna last Saturday I've slowly losing sense smell throughout week, today can't smell anything; even went get COVID test yesterday worried got reinfected test came back negative. ""nest perfect?"" Yes, vaccinated people still get COVID.  Vaccines protect known variants time, also possible vaccinated *and* immunocompromised person creates variant could potentially cause breakthrough others. http://www.allgov.com/news/controversies/us-5-percent-of-world-population-80-percent-of-opioid-consumption-141215?news=855100 like finally felt freedom give range always deserved risked heavy judgment even consequences. hopeful return elementary schoolers running unsupervised neighborhoods permanent change.

S. Korea secures additional Pfizer vaccines 20 mln people Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  you’re area high spread, think that’s fair. least wait see approach relative end date. I’m SF Bay Area county 0.6% positive rate 82 cases past 14 days. would imagine county 13% spread hopefully within month two hope happens you’ll resume living life normally. recommendation get vaccine even covid better prepares body.

There's guarantee covid infection would similar efficacy Pfizer Moderna.

Also change whole DNA, informs cells make certain section Covid. factory making AZ us shut quality control. 25 million doses. barely scratches surface worldwide problem. 

Many nations world poor desperate need. US help neighbors. account make huge difference Latin America accomplish something - let teachers administrators keep getting paid. Basically worthless actual learning, though. 

If said “nah, schools dangerous” March 2020 closed, furloughed teachers admins onto unemployment - know, like restaurant workers, event workers, store workers, entertainers, convention workers, hotel workers, - schools would reopened May last year. 

But instead, educational fraud “remote learning” propagated months year, countless months education socialization development flushed toilet, kids paid price. true. Varients thing. Nah buddy, wrong ideas. Lmaaaaoooo  Oh dear, vaccines yet approved children. CDC privately funded vaccine company. pseudo government agency. 40 vaccine patents, makes lot money... also make unreliable source information. patents coronaviruses well....wait, can’t patent nature, wtf viruses order patent them. true Israelis found much lower efficacy (closer 33%) Pfizer's data showed 50% efficacy 14 days.

I really want 92% number true I'm almost 14 days 1st dose. hard lockdown? way stop this. really wonderful read about. necesssary. I'm giving month two more. There's downsides family ""wait see"" approach ensure vaccine efficacy holds. Thanks encouragement - GP go hiv clinic, they'll let know I'm up. recently 70+ changed week. ok. know left-overs given GPs anyone, good still different officially opening group 3 nationwide. “I think hindsight 2020,”

No kidding, 2021 now. seems like COVID broken people’s ability assess risk. You’re 100x likely die car crash COVID you’ve vaccinated. Assuming surgeon epidemiologist friend (side note - cousin process getting Master’s epidemiology addition MD) vaccinated, what’s rationale? 13% positivity rate doesn’t mean much chances low. 

You mention kids again, kids safe COVID, least see rationale extra careful you’re them. say wife vaccinated, chances get COVID dining indoors spread kid akin struck lightning. simple answer US empire countries like Canada (where live) vassal states. assumption always US something there's need replicate work since US take care given pledged fealty (behind scenes course; publicly everything framed ""partnerships""). 

Anyway, canada tiny army? US giant army anyone attacks us US take care (if US' border).

Why would Canada build pharma companies US already them? 

And way, there's well known established business practice lots companies founded canada acquired larger US companies. even try build companies, US juggernauts buy out. 

All say, Canada assumes US look many different areas (which allows us allocate resources things like universal healthcare). 

Trump wake call risky strategy was. Sorry hear that. Luckily cons still planned. NYCC still planned happen, is, (as now), AnimeNYC (in November), DerpyCon NJ (October), PuchiCon (in Atlantic City, August). far, none cancelled, things continue improve NJ, maybe be. think state cancelled prematurely, yes. mean things getting better. cons may take longer come back, others may not. Either way, give up. Still, sorry hear Daisho. Cooking one always easy. I'm really top things I'll go put extra servings fridge freezer, ""there's half cup extra, worked hard it, really enough save, want throw away"" add time. GP go hiv clinic, they'll let know I'm up. recently 70+ changed week. ok.

However state group 3 yet apparently, neither handing AZ every age group olders seem take it. diagnosed cases would 7% first wave went hospital tested. widely estimated least 15-20% covid point last 13 months. I've seen estimates even higher extreme end. Greece opening schools, big malls, shops, restaurants etc 3k cases per day 80 deaths. hospitals already near capacity. 

I sure go end well. too. 40hrs week ""essential"" retail. close contact w customers. 9 11 store got covid December. vacation.

I'm fully vaxed &amp; 1mo+. 3 11 us shots despite everyone eligible month. 

I desperately want get mask. I'm looking forward another summer ""curbside"" Louisiana heat.  That's feel right now. definitely got vaccine based feeling sick decade past 24 hours.  Lol say that? don’t agree statement, doesn’t mean get assume rest I’m saying. it’s even worth continuing exchange someone thinks figured out. Like 18 year old fresh outta high school lol poor kiddo Yeah. Brazil one best free healthcare systems world. problem lack vaccines due buying should. Ok thanks, believe earlier analysis suggested 92% efficacy (95%CI: 69.0–98.3) (if I've got hands right article). confidence interval overlaps study cite, still reasonable say recent data shows significantly less protection? Could said protection single dose fairly good (i.e. likely 50%)?

Edit: word Mexican here, already did, sent around 3 million us Canada, already used elderly people. Pfizer comes frozen pellet vial defrost 30mins mixing. add 1.6ml saline reconstitute it. here's error likely happened. 

Vial reconstituted properly 6 doses extracted usual. However vial unintentionally discarded. Vaccinator assumed freshly defrosted vial added 1.6 ml saline 0.1-0.2ml remaining vaccine solution. Creating highly diluted solution effectively saline. 

It's easy mistake make paying attention cannot speak France, America trained thousands people give vaccinations never done before. mistakes likely going fairly common. prevent error practice reconstituting, predrawing doses immediately discarding vial. said ""cancel culture"" shows trusted. Mine 18 days first second doses Pfizer. VA said ok. 

My side effects second felt horrendous, assume short interval. true all. Stop lying. 50 percent first dose soon teenagers become eligible. sorry leadership let down. taking care us. vaccinating neighbors NEXT, makes sense.  US stockpiling vaccines never use millions. Whatever logic using line reality.

No. sit 20 million

Prove then. Ah yes, that’s Italy, famously individualistic culture, higher per capita death rate US. selfishness problem. Brazil.

For someone claims care much people, sure brush 600k deaths easily. Nothing said true all. US response covid much better many countries. Percentage wise middle pack death infection . vaccine wise whole game. Anti maskers US annoying bunch. google attitudes towards masks Russia, vaccine refusals france. Much worse. US ""blocking"" exports. We're sending right now. 

The reality US much better quite nations, next Israel first nation covid. countries like US said done. No.  Biden already mentioned central America, makes sense given want monitor borders rules preventing US manufacturers exporting been. issue amount US purchased slowed exports leaves doses unused. 
Still problem simple fix exiting contracts. Given priority legislation actually see problem exactly that. People terribly bad understanding statistics scale, included.

I still opted vaccine easily apparent right thing low risk. wrong lol Reported incivility. government pretty confident new wave summer, may small clubs bars open, week 2 young people getting covid would spread old people vaccinated, far result month high hospital stay high death rate coming again, could less issue wave goes slower think Anecdotal evidence. Check chart another guy posted NYT. close 500k shots/day J&amp;J Never say never. Never thought I’d relieved see 681 deaths wow it’s really coming down! promising. Denmark country EU. UK left Europe 

Seriously?  I’ve got work-related convention go every year. sent poll weeks ago: 90% said want go back person.

Just got announcement they’re switching virtual in-person! I’ll flying Denver July. Well heard Pfizer sent EUA recently. Went Vegas February glorious waiting time since beginning pandemic, one coworkers went India visit family weeks ago. can't believe bad luck is. 20 minutes + getting queue + 15 minute observation + 20 minutes home negligible hurdle many americans. Also car negligible hurdle.  Pfizer/moderna essentially 0% death rate severe hospitalization receiving vaccine even getting Covid. really protected actual MIT study (not shitty article) agrees them. Reedpop folks implied might change heart cons come around masks may longer required time arrive. (September, October, November, etc.)  Swedish getting fucked UK muscle decades, suez crisis happened reality remember Sorry hear. Sounds like encouraging activities aren’t exactly great regardless pandemic.

Hope find new friends encourage go enjoy healthier activities them. Don’t let get closed up.

We need other. logic entirely flawed considering every medical intervention modern world carries risk. Get shot kind literally handed list risks - vaccine injuries incredibly rare, possibility. it’s like Covid shots particularly dangerous, extremely well publicized. ultimately, people refusing take responsibility choices refusing look wealth information subject, don’t get pass. choice ignorant. implying EU ""critically"" short laughable

It true though. We're fine

No lol. sugarcoating this? Daisho. It’s anime convention Wisconsin Dells. think ages make difference sure. kids 16, 13 8. two oldest can’t wait go back next year youngest never wants go back lol.  great see. /arr/Pennsylvania largely still mindset we’re approaching fourth wave.

Really silly there. always risk person school daycare. It’s indoors close quarters hours day. debate whether risk necessary (and think many cases is). coworker mine left Canada India celebrate brother’s wedding last week spite knowing situation there. Boasting well connected could get vaccinated there. someone would willingly travel India right shocking me. Israel smaller Canada vaccines. India bigger USA them. see size answer, someone provided good answer explaining political bets made pandemic. think answer illuminating far. vaccination requirement?  1000s got screwed parents? shit talked well. american government AZ responsible issues. want USA help maybe shit many people leaders America blamed another country

I think one leader got eviscerated ballot box post discussing heart stuff (usually under-30 folks; 22 year old woman died weeks ago think someone linked period concern, lot women worried (especially cuz tendency base medicine male argentine karens want kids back school instead virtual clases. stop spreading fake idea extremely old people die Covid, understand fact ""older"" makes better?

No one thread claimed *only* old people die covid. anyone said ""better"" old people die. know arguing here. Endless lockdown, i.e. lockdown done right way, lockdown kept place solid end infection rate near zero, WORKS. New Zealand, AU, China (after much delay), Taiwan, countries successfully dealt covid did.

What fails on-and-off lockdowns, like Germany, New York, California, Florida, places could managed virus stick through, stopping people working requires providing financial support conservative neolib states bear thought of.

Sorry im really tired shot meant aphganistan specifically.

Funny, smart move would government ban anyone entering country countries. hard due passports entering international flight would show whether virus hotspot... tried come put next flight back arrived from, even Americans. like enough typhoid Marys already. big population doesn’t matter it’s rate. heard AZ stockpile might expiring soon. best interest loan Canada. sure that's true? Bravo sir, made truly laugh loud. They’re talking rate. Today health minister published new timeline vaccines still understood problem. I’m sure person speaks 4-5 languages English first. India fuck ton languages. I'm layman this, I've read:

The first dose mRNA vaccines essentially ""primes"" immune system lookout spike protein. people covid often stronger reaction *first* dose second.

So first dose, may light side effects, weeks later, second dose (which exact ingredients size first) tells body basically ""this spike protein dangerous,"" that's immune system really ramps create longer lasting antibodies. 

Since spike protein new us, react pretty strongly seems. flu, we've exposed level lives, vaccine (for people) anything strong. others strong reaction, norm.

Back mRNA, two-dose regimen Pfizer Modern contain ""boosters,"" rather two shots exact thing. eventual booster may slightly different formula account variants, may half dose, there's much info it.

With mind, I'd bet side effects first dose, likely less second people since many months later opposed ""shocking"" immune system weeks later. Make mandatory. Like go rent buy house make mandatory check credit score, make mandatory buy something vaccinated.  children drop education system, protected international pandemic novel virus. could write EXACTLY thing US. Exactly!  too. AZ J&amp;J adenovirus vector vaccines.

Novavax subunit vaccine, presents antigens immune system without pathogen particles. Since different type they're optimistic present issues. Anyone experiencing major anxiety vaccinated going previously risky ""leisurely"" activities?

Me husband fully vaccinated 2 weeks. parents also fully vaccinated flew visit us state. eating restaurants, usually outdoors except last night ate indoors crowded restaurant. can't help terrible anxiety maybe vaccines flukes one us still end sick.

It's new uncertainty like, ""what vaccines REALLY work...?""

and sad thing data showing averaging around 70-100 cases day city U.S. surge yet third world countries experiencing massive surges feel worlds away anymore 6-8 months, cities U.S. inundated India now.

When stop thinking Covid? European countries loaned AZ vaccine others remember correctly. 1 billion served. I'm lovin' it! gaslighting? Gaslighting lying perpetuate narrative. factually piece cloth. like protesting cold weather wearing coat? Maybe India put effort securing oxygen asking international help?  Same. severe side effects Moderna 2nd shot, fever, chills, sweating, everything hurt. Started 12 hours shot lasted entire next day. day felt perfect fine like nothing happened (today)

Never reaction vaccine before. Asked six weeks....other people taking deadly virus seriously florida therefore I? going with? fairly certain lying lot cases.

It's interesting India nearly 17 million total cases whereas China claims 90.5 k total cases. Uh ya, that's kind vaccines around.  see Trump must charge now. administered doses world US. great, walking grocery store. hate high rep leg exercises running.  25%, one country. probably counties well best data/datasets right Covid vaccine adverse effects United States? Specifically Pfizer/Moderna. think Brazil 35% 40% population vaccinated one dose end June Imagine living America appreciate studies important work / contributions. However, writer / Redditor, may suggest paragraph breaks, please. 

It would break thoughts, make arguments clearer. trying dick: honestly trying help &amp; us digest information. 

""Edit"" paragraph break, anytime present new idea. Okay all. xoxoxo. Anybody know why, 10+ years getting flu shot, never reaction tiny amount arm soreness, mRNA booster (dose 2 moderna) basically leveled day? 

Do know rumored covid booster terms sickness shot? secular countries going better this. Remind someone exact tactic brazil..... know, right? Never thought I'd see day. went ""can't wait vaccine... whenever *that happens*"" getting vaccinated near future. exciting! someone wear mask work (to prevent contamination) still find attitude utterly bizarre.

Is PPE uncomfortable? Yes, everyone lab complained this.

Does mean take off? WTF, no. Crazy see husbands Argentine uncle died yesterday covid. Took CDC three months recommend masks. blame science, political. orders magnitude worse China Wuhan. needs new term nation like US going through. call developed nations losing stability regressing. got moderna, administrator went it’s emergency authorized, etc etc. understand take risks. would assume would same, no?  Advised? FUCKING BAN GOING! Advising anything they're self centered jerks. That's sickening, pun intended. That's abhorrent. donate back AstraZeneca? That's bit waste money, course. People give fuck getting vaccine saintly mask compliance. Indeed, states mask mandates present, low mask compliance throughout, vaccine hesitancy. there's carrot need it.

Since there's mechanism prove vaccination, enforcement would fall private industry, would defacto end indoor mask compliance kind.

How would productive, all?  mean cons making argument every context lockdown proposed yet turn true, maybe case is. issue mask wearing protecting others. help protect you, nearly much protecting others. protecting yourself, I'd 100% ok voluntary compliance, protecting others, which, sadly, people largely seem care :(  Plenty people didn’t trust MRNA tech ok traditional J&amp;J vax. know quite actually waited J&amp;J Ugh, Indian?

People: ""Can get one?""

Scotty: ""About that..."" got tasty vaccine short answer make vaccines  putting words mouth. agreed IFR varies lot place place; probably higher 0.6% NYC. estimate study provided *overall* estimate

I also see ridiculous think close half NYC virus. Estimates last April (before winter surge) suggested much 20-25% city gotten sick. think half city actually it, see hard believe 30-40% did. kids play others safe”bubble”. Outdoors weeks indoors place rented hour. parents vaxed know people going accuse BS, hotel shuttle driver today complaining it. Wow, talking shit usa asking help them. whole new level....  Guys, I'm UFC show right Jax Vegas awesome. Packed crowd (well getting main card started yet), masks, etc. Feels like 2019 again!  Recent studies shown people becoming hesitant likelihood boosters. looking like number shots important efficacy side effects comes vaccine hesitant. mean that’s good thing right? Thanks sharing! thought reason would simpler navigate, it’s going complicated lot longer - helps hear parents trying!  Also vaccine finder sites always date. show available sites try actually book pharmacy website, says unavailable.  Let’s send phizer vaccines India  CDC source use make decisions. could look countries, like New Zealand, we're handling things clear masking made sense. early pandemic, information flying directions.

We're place. Even Israel recently removed mask mandates *outside*, yet country close putting whole thing behind them, largely due vaccines *and maintaining measures*.

You want find way justify reckless behavior, won't. rooted normalcy bias denial. argument unless person intimate expert level understanding takes develop vaccine get EUA, they’re entitled opinion lost right decide goes bodies? 

Whether think I’m credible fact remains blood clot links discovered regulatory approvals doesn’t help convince hesitants get shot. case - tell that’s inaccurate statement - AZ J&amp;J linked blood clots killed people. think impact public perceptions those? Sorry, cheering virus ending. I've fully vaxed since late Feb wear mask unless to. Florida, I've asked wear mask literally last 6 weeks. problem wearing mask. right. stop cheering virus. beating it.  anecdotal hope, vast majority employees college students pretty much agree mask wearing continue post-pandemic sick. whatever want. dad could vaccine months ago refuses put effort getting it. won’t goes see GP tell quit asshole give right then. vaccines readily available doctor’s offices think always holdouts people unable take time unless something actually wrong. talking man. AZ british-swedish Swedish getting fucking special priority vaccine, looked like UK getting preferential treatment correctly shut down.

Your argument makes sense, least make argument production US something, ""special relationship"" basis vaccine allocation follow along lines all, private companies work. Moderna sort Canadian roots! What’s going thread? frustrating people shame others earning living  might argue swamp ass worse fate wear mask hot day. 

How dare normalize oppression forced wishes wear pants. Again, think 0.6%, think half people New York City, including children, infected.

In words, wrong. journalist really need head-to-toe PPE? 

I imagine lot people dying COVID directly lack oxygen healthcare breakdown. wishes??? funny. 

Nobody asked pandemic mate. Close double that, number shots given. need one shot I'll planning enroll baby daycare first time immunity kicks in, part I'm extending breastfeeding hopefully provide passive immunity. weren't, I'd stick playdates without protections among fully vaccinated households. many leery vaccine didn’t go multi year validation process literally every vaccine medication goes through. wrong?

Because 99% people absolutely zero idea takes get drug EUA stage. considering two “safe” vaccines later linked serious blood clots actually killed people declared “safe”.

And goes credibility, dumb thing say. breastfeeding 8 month old fully vaccinated since end March. little better taking out. took grocery store first time day. took friends house vaccinated also 18 month old daughter (obviously). feel better lately. Pediatrician says may protection milk. doesn’t really much weight yet much research done it. guess that’s upshot feeling symptoms vaccine injection, know didn’t forget give you. Yeah, ""at least"" 50 million, according Bolsonero hell job thinning useless eaters?!? post answered question lol. proves harder get vaccinated portland, chicago, l.a., etc compared mississippi  Guess we'll forget international trade altogether then... Never solutions oriented group. complainers. lack flu occurred southern hemisphere winter obviously going repeat northern hemisphere's winter. media CDC made nonsense twindemic.

If masks worn, flu shots unnecessary first year decade get flu vaccine. Northerners watch southern hemisphere see expect. probably light flu season world. early conclusion, peer-reviewed answers right now. Ok found hiv clinic started group 3 week means patients course. city's website still set group 2. Good news me, could get appointment literally day :) 2 pharmacies slots within 15 miles live pretty much proves supply issue rather demand means pharmacies booked out.

What prove? want shot point get one willing drive 20 minutes, even live situation say, portland, podunk town mississippi thats difference supply bottleneck demand one

No one disputes easier get shot MS Portland (or Chicago, LA, etc.). Lfgggg keep dropping! People mostly intelligent I’ve found. many Indians traveling there. Put stocks use rotten veg.

Germany 24 hour shopping, let alone things could considere necessary. best cities like Berlin supermarkets open 7-8am till midnight, 7-8am till 9pm. really know necessary trips curfew would really contrict. 

And People seem miss curfew evening/at night supposed prevent people going parties/gatherings indoors. people talking ""but outdoors dangerous"" miss curfew also stop people going someone elses place, least forces go home early stay till 2 3 whatever. 

Sure gatherings already rules almost impossible enforce people homes. cellphone data shows back 80% prepandemic mobility people get around that, first lockdown people following rules better also selfristricted around 30%. 

We need break 3rd wave now. ICU beds getting fewer fewer, Doctors tell us desperatly everyday need get shit together people going die covid lack ICU bed. 

Even young healthy covid likely kill car accident local hospital ICU bed anymore still might die actually happens. Central America also game poor countries currently surging also coming country.

It makes sense send Biden already hinted world.

Yankee stadium makes fill app says either vax (at point) tested negative within 72 hours. honest honestly think every MLB stadium that?

Thanks America. Okay, fit ignorant? Stop thinking people can't workout home standing argument pandemic fucked already fucked schedule. actually disciplined, pandemic change anything. Thank you! definitely 100% make sure get sick COVID. Checkmate Pfizer Moderna. word matters feeds paranoia. 

I wouldn’t surprised couple months CDC turns face (again) states knew vaccines effective reducing transmission well, didn’t want tell public didn’t want excuse non vaccinated people. entire family got last weekend even flu vaccine. group traveling rural KS help vaccinate homeless population Kansas City, pause J&amp;J. hope they're able get get population vaccinated single shot J&amp;J instead try locate people twice. think original corona deadlines 1 10 1 asymptotic 10 dead average may moved 3 5. reason 4 spread 1 higher deadliness group 10 side effect. pause, surveys said similar levels trust. fact, groups people, namely vaccine hesitant, j &amp; j actually preferred pfizer &amp; moderna US consumes 60% goods.

I'll wait that's longer requirement. I’m sure still case, back made first vaccine appointment month ago, county reserving available J&amp;J shots housebound people couldn’t come vaccine sites. I’m sure exactly system getting vulnerable population shots, must make logistics much easier need one dose. Sure time line coming people thought important save bucks vaccines save lives/end pandemic. 

I live Germany know handful people vaccinated. I’ll believe July timeline happens personally I’m convinced I’ll able get vaccinated year. That’s true. American don’t even believe virus exists.  Nah, that's biz call ""the bubble."" share video?

I told family prolong life masks wearing cloth outside mask thin layer mask inside cos works first barrier humidity; would love see somehow based. brazil result shows, break exact definition. However 50.4% sounds bad therefore that's great headline.

Here another result Chile, also article.

Brazilian trials indicated general efficacy drug preventing symptomatic infection 50%, though shower far higher efficacy preventing hospitalization moderate severe cases.

Indonesia gave vaccine emergency-use approval based interim data showing 65% effective, Turkish trial efficacy preventing symptomatic infection 83.5% 100% preventing severe illness hospitalization.

&amp;#x200B;

So yeah... number varies lot, 50.4% fit narrative therefore repeated.

However pretty obvious mRNA vaccine far shows best result uses cutting edge technologies, Chinese vaccine uses old style traditional technologies less effective, however mean useless bad.

I think pretty stupid demonize geopolitical enemy's vaccine sake geopolitics, need much vaccine possible get crisis. I'm critical next guy stupid bullshit going on, really mostly minority people. Now, people would fired sun sane population, they're still representative ""average"" American IMO. It’s expedient blame America covid woes actually fix problems. Dude, seriously chill lol. ones trying argue seem smart. 

Please explain dum dum me? read started low 2 Pfizer? earlier models used chemical means detox chlorine/phosgene. doubt detox covid entirely. guess they're least similar quality modern surgical masks. id rather ended good instead coming back us needing yearly vaccines. Lol yeah really homeless man collapsing unheard even without pandemic? saw would probably assume would overdose withdrawal malnutrition. covid lmao Vaccinated people 10-20x less likely get COVID, even asymptomatic cases, unvaccinated, even less likely severe illness.

*I bot, action performed automatically.

And, notably different UK, prioritizing second doses well people complete vaccination regimens. think lying, testing capabilities reached maximum. Clinics advise test unless lot symptoms. probably lot cases, untested. places require it. That’s messaging issue. chances contracting lower well chances transmitting getting severely ill dying. (Those become basically zero; last 2 things severely ill dying). 

So still see self interest point. messaging push imo. Everyone would someone else already gotten part. Right. begrudge anyone else nervous, I'm saying can't relate. I'm gonna give anyone hard time want continue wearing masks whatever, I'm saying I'm personally done worrying it. I'm vaccinated previously covid. 

I tell everyone know get vaccinated even managed get entire family vaccinated weekend J&amp;J vaccine paused. like inaudibly laughing phone get funny text something. idk mask means dont control facial features. everyone three things, problem. simple thing, yet people (I'm US) pitch fits it. wear masks distance/stay away mask less parties crowds, shutdowns, people die end long hauler covid. care risk long hauler. husband disabled, can't risk it. know masks big goddamn deal. I’ve heard it’s “new type vaccine” odds already low they’d die it, getting something that’s new riskier minds getting new virus low chance killing them. (Yes tried risks death fact vaccines really safe people avail) I'm sure understand article's saying trial:

* ""The vaccine 78% efficacy ""mild-to-severe"" Covid-19 cases.""

 * *How define ""mild-to-severe""?*

* include ""very mild infections"", efficacy goes 50.4%.

* ""People symptoms also appear included"" trial. 

 * *So what's efficacy asymptomatic cases?*
 * *Or included ""very mild infections""?* acted covid over. Blame that. Feel free keep wearing want understand many stop fully vaxxed. watch international news. think lie.

But youtube vid made someone also thinks NASA covered aliens moon, that's true apparently. conversation costing considerable iq points. wonder goes minds Indian netizens

Sustained economic growth RESULT epidemic control, way around.

The problem 1) India take necessary steps control epidemic even 1 year, put mildly, 2) current Indian gov interested politicking make look good rather actually controlling epidemic, 3) situation come human disaster costs resources remediate existing resources India has. Aa such, solution India's problem lay 1) India's gov actually epidemic control work stops politicking reputation points, 2) International aids India actually access resources need stem blood flow. That’s normal approach. little anxiousness. It’s hard people like people like reporting work everyday 90% clients aren’t wearing mask imagine people live areas close 100% mask compliant stay homers haven’t left house whole time, sometimes literally.

He said knowing covid airborne, least every coronavirus was. knowing purely medical demand masks would vastly outstrip supply, would running short matter what, new production could diverted hospitals.

It’s super duper rare, shouldn’t worry. Covid couple hundred times likely kill you. got JJ vax news. Even news I'd still get it. Covid complications far far far worse. actual contracts govt manufacturers, policy. traditional vote block BJP (Modi's party) always upper caste people. vast majority immigrants states upper caste people. great mystery Indians meet support him. Ok. arrested acting like typical American article UK talking AU. yea, choice those. We're discussing Andorra vs Paraguay infection per se, cancer treatment one big ambitions. idea use mRNA vaccines train immune system attack cancerous cells. ***ONE TRILLION NEXT BABY LET'S GO*** Exactly. believe again, govt isn’t completely truthful kids Covid. They’re scared economy come standstill comes kids getting sick. I’m sending son there’s vaccine him, like wouldn’t send polio,smallpox measles sweeping schools without vaccination available comment deleted now, kinda interested seeing car wreck excited developing nations finally test meaningful enough capacity get accurate understanding many people actually infected. don’t think so. taking issue came decision, I’m stating regardless come decision decision objectively persons right decide put bodies. right respect every situation. pass judgement choosing poorly, seriously going deny it’s right choose? that’s ultimately argument - think person right choose whether take vaccine? do. See, get rednecks get jabbed. Tell foreigners trying take America's vaccines. \*eagle screech\*. happening many cases since years india. cautious image. 

Most part India still watches TV believes whatsapp forwards paid media shows flowery version govt. 24/7. 

When election comes either start war Pakistan build temple instigate religion based riots everyone happily votes back power.

This vicious cycle. funny, Fauci happy lie teeth

We're done here. wonder response US (politically individually) would different COVID killed children young adults higher rate?   
Basically flip script. incidence unvaccinated population 18-29 year olds inflamed heart 1 100,00. vaccinated, seems 1 20,000. That’s pretty big jump worth looking into. great Common Mental Facial recognition / Biometrics

It ain't done fuck allergies I'll tell that. Seems like discussions locking even table. One argue cost-benefit balance lockdowns, ever situation lockdown needed, surely it. Nothing certain medicine, chances astronomically small compared chances long-term effects covid.

So benefit clearly outweighs risk.

By way- vaccine works similarly virus work, much much safer. know side effects quite well. Several countries offered help India also denied request. Yeah, Pfizer 1 overall ache, Pfizer 2 seriously bonehurting juice 18 hours PS, tag says US, UK. bit topic comment reminded image. I'd really love DC get Alex Ross back paint recreation poster composed many leading scientists worked vaccines. Hell Alex Ross, they've got lot fantastic artists right now. think would great see something like that.

The people made Moderna, Pfizer, Johnson Johnson, Astrazeneca, Novavax vaccines undoubtedly saved millions millions lives already less ten percent planet vaccinated. Even seeing here, goes Sinovac Sputnik V vaccines, lesser efficacy otherwise. struggle think another recent event group scientists able suddenly short notice literally save millions people, us- included- know names, much less faces. would great see something like that. small group people saving millions qualify considered heroes, know would. infected virus spreading early disease course , testing time period, often symptoms, critical controlling outbreak. India currently vaccinating around 2 3 million people per day, similar daily records United States, inadequate population four times size. Serum Institute India, world’s largest manufacturer vaccine doses, reported last week unable ramp production due U.S. export controls raw materials. Yes! help friends. Also got parents friend’s dad appointments Price Chopper continuously refreshing. cvs you’re open anywhere state put state name search results come up. science shit Prepare disappointed. see people talk experiencing anxiety going back normal, thought maskless crowd scary even vaccinated man relate.

I got covid back like July fiance works healthcare, got J&amp;J vaccine end March. soon stores venues around stop requiring masks I'm done. Ohhh choice those. use J&amp;J vaccine pause?  bought ton vaccines plus logistical supply chain infrastructure produce deliver vaccines. words, selfish.  Ah yeah. right kind. India’s case, follow local laws suppose. Three days ago world reached highest number COVID cases since beginning pandemic. governance right basically shit show. Election rallies,protests religious gatherings held without COVID-19 safety protocols. country facing dire shortage Oxygen government wants hide truth. Great stuff! Yeah man, nailed it. killed SARS Terraces stuff opening next Wednesday Netherlands, meanwhile hospitals warning ""code black"" (no space ICU: hospitals need select people criteria treated) dealt problem either. Covid 19 running rampant. absolutely believe always power wipe least Flu type B entire time. resistant vaccines? whole concept ""removing criticism"" f*** come from? Yes, daily rate start drop hit 70% vaccinated.

It peaks months BEFORE, flatten long tail near zero 70% vaccinated.

A week ago almost certainly uptake peak. that. 

Rich countries bankrolled vaccine companies. Phase IV testing. Meaning they're proven beyond doubt safe, production increased economies scale kick in. There's dosage compensation X. one X chromosome total essentially active. men women get equivalent amount X. 
Historically speaking bias women's healthcare studies, may effect too. Honestly... Indian government going collapsed? looks like absolute chaos. Really horrible. usually say kids sticky. fully wipe they're somehow sticky again. took lot fake ones... It’s legitimate question. It’s vocalisation irrational fear. 

When vaccine EVER killed millions people? That’s vaccines do. Vaccines aren’t drugs. give body instructions experience FIGHT disease, create one. isn’t Stephen King novel.

Wtf. hope effect supply need it. Perfectly safe vacation destination according german government tho! unfortunately kolkata rate truly 50% testing stop slow spread. Although still worthwhile tool see trending point thing save wave lockdown. without lockdown pay blood lot people die. Numerical trends concerning still don’t seem anywhere near disastrous India. Pakistani I’m thankful highly militarized border two countries right mean yeah, probably worst possible time choose bring new humans world think anyone testing kids 5 yet. see 12 ups soon (they've already applied) 5 - 11 year olds undergoing trial. guess they'll try approved next school year starts long rollout 12 - 15 goes alright. take long hit India? small set people cause novel effect. long set small great lol wtf Hmmm yes trump got tweets critical removed Twitter way round  It’s proportional amount cases they’re experiencing well Source ? Wat? fucking shit kids human. doesn’t mean immune systems work like 40 yo’s, 70 yo’s. strange response Even though they’re two separate viruses? Pfizer Bro! may related women bring birth control. effect hormones course would different men women child bearing age. article... learned today, thank you. said, broader usage might become acceptable now? vulnerable people physically cant get vaccinated due allergies quirks immune systems Excess deaths debunks conspiracy theory. country offered help India denied? 

P.S. say 'China' last time asked help got faulty test kits made things worst helping.

The US country denied help India. Biden less trump us. True, Twitter done lot annoying don’t like wearing them. fine won’t fine after? think contact tracing actually happening places. happens billion plastic syringes? nope 1 billion dosages people need 2 dosages vaccine half billion people vaccinated also closer 8 billion people rather 7 read article: ""The FDA said received several reports hospitalizations life-threatening conditions people drank MMS. least seven people died drinking chemical mixture, federal prosecutors say.""

mms fancy bleach sold waiter got big tip foreign national would disagree you. fucking disaster. government time world pulling time plan simple oxygen tanks. Terrible ! incompetence Modi government mind-blowing yet keep winning elections 🤦 really hard accept people everything help pandemic abate. help society, economy, neighbor community. saddens me. Always happens here. Government put effort suppressing voices instead fixing issue. actually half billion need 2 dosages rhis 1 billion referring dosages ammount people terrified thinking actual covid numbers India are.  Let's pretend actually globally rich nations block supply poorer ones. Already few. Google double mutant triple mutant strains.  whats problem that? “Health experts said India became complacent winter, new cases running 10,000 day seemed control. Authorities lifted restrictions, allowing resumption big gatherings, including large festivals political rallies local elections”

This makes nervous USA reopens hopefully amount vaccines we’ll ok $$$ Yea one doesn't. Last time checked children human beings too. I'm RN kinda true guess. often feel know best many subjects I'm well educated on, although PLENTY don't! also true real, actual lives rest hands day, give certain confidence decision making. 

It's still gross amount RNs selling essential oils anti-mask/anti-vax/anti-science BS. know people believe claims bc ""she's nurse."" imagine every fucking day. Different bugs affect different groups different ways. I’m saying one way another covid, nothing surprises either way. I’m doctor, agree Convincing population fight step 1. Step 2 actually work closing borders, mass testing, contact tracing, bringing actual results. comparison totally valid considering India actually work step 2 addition step 1. can’t say know Florida law works, might difficult proving murder. Surprisingly, it’s good idea means whatsoever, household concentration bleach shouldn’t cause lasting harm. could difficult proving killed anyone.

Who knows else put though provide us account? want see what’s happening. Try population size India. getting screwed Thailand too, massive increase infections, weeks ago hundred 2500-3000 day.
At current vacine rate looking 3-5 years easy everyone gets vaccine, India may never get without help kids definitely catching highly doubt large number getting seriously sick, otherwise death totals would raise alarm bells

that said, brazil, probably due poor medical infrastructure, larger usual number kids died it. 2,060 kids 9 died corona brazil, compared 266 kids 17 america. long medical system stays fine, looks like almost definitely much vaccinations done, ok wanna let know lost argument. amazed everywhere aiming utter bare minimum. ICU filled good job, done. maybe link invalid hoax Anarchy go well people families weapons. try pull employees sauce? Got second shot Tuesday. First one sore arm. Second shot, 20hrs body aches kind like flu, hey went away within 12 hours. fever, sore throat, anything like actually getting flu. Except body aches. about? It’s literally government’s primary responsibility look citizens. would borderline criminally negligent export vaccines still demand here. 

You don’t even resident US get vaccine. family visiting us another country got vaccine without problem. won’t long we’re exporting lot vaccines. Thanks sharing! It’s Florida man

Works ways. totally right. bad. meant 'common cold' + 'flu'. get locking people [baselessly claim drinking milk causes slander [beloved [entire [refuse follow guidelines animal remember so-called leader free world mentioning injecting disinfectant hitting body bunch light something... maybe Trump got idea people since told miracle solution?

From Baby Oil Corona-Vaccine… Supply chain innovation going strong!!   hold on. hard thing balance. tweets critical government sceptical vaccines, masks even existence pandemic. flat misinformation. people stop trusting government *in general*, handling pandemic, becomes much chaotic public health crisis

So lot right reasons remove *some* tweets. experience, went vaccination,there queue 4 people (all non Bulgarians) nurses sat waiting next patient one queue.

Maybe area live, Bulgarian friends vaccinated said vaccine.  ""Don't mind acquiring immunity though infection""

This. Is. Perfect.

I may borrowing sentiment going forward! r/ABoringDystopia 


Fuck governments like this. job govern, effectively. can't won't, GTFO way someone else can. deserve every bit criticism scrutiny leveled them. Emergency approval...which reason blood clot pause...if regular approval nobody would ever know risk many many people experienced it. Let die peace! Let die peace!  ... I'm gonna lie I'm really sick incessant whining conspiracy theories anti-mask crowd. I'm ok simply getting annual flu vaccine wearing respirator style masks (which effectively protect user, unlike surgical cloth masks) told two weeks second shot, vaccination appointments. US enough vaccines cover population top guys hoarding AZ vaccines going use anyway. decides misinformation? Allowing small group people control information dangerous game play... Still helps try prevent people travelling to/from friends' houses though. sure spread. India's positivity rate interesting coming weeks. Well, majority users American, makes sense would get attention. seen anything hateful Indians, though. see lot people concerned situation citizens there. high test availability limited. doesn’t mean 50% total population infected. Hot climate theory also void read article. I’m also ER physician. post correct. fact someone dies something doesn’t mean died it. That’s said, “it could difficult proving it.” can't tell serious discussion guys what, two clear disconnect Europe, continent, EU, political alliance. It’s absolutely already considering travel restrictions Indian travelers Sure. India exported 50 million hydroxychloroquine tablets president needed it. say then. helped guys. Whether tablets helpful another thing send needed it. we're trouble, guys say ""your"" supplies? identify caused infection? large variety viruses cause severe respiratory infection there's even larger variety pathogens outside viruses also infect tracks common respiratory viruses US flu surveillance system (and guess COVID system, many systems). lot them. headline referring number minors vaccinated. second thought Obama inoculating Greta Thunberg. Yes have, one denying that. stopping export raw materials global pandemic shitty move too. understand approve AZ exactly clot risk J&amp;J type mask wear fit tightly  Imagine Donald Trump drinks Cow Urine. Clorox Bleach injections useless unless also pair shoving UV bulb butt turning on. I've seen many critical Brazil, India, US' leadership they've handled outbreaks. Meanwhile, Belgium, Czechia, Italy worse US Portugal, Spain, France far behind. 

It's hard keep falling back excuse countries hit first they've year fix mistakes. Ruling party India usual trying put blame someone else incompetence. Usually used Nehru, Biden fault. Trump genius actually. He’s committing crimes entire adult life without consequence. He’s conned multiple top tier banks loaning money fraudulent businesses, forced banks forgive loans. parlayed reality tv show becoming president. Biden one giving AZ vaccine aren’t using India. Trump turned bunch vaccines allowed go countries (he didn’t strictly charitable reasons). 

And anyway take care country first. efficient system deliver vaccines makes sense also spreading vaccines around world won’t useful getting one region herd immunity. 

So vaccine policy isn’t America First comment hyperparisanship worst This, tell employees sick, ""just wear mask"" come work anyway!

Let people wear mask situation can't stay home for. Nope . america first . Anything contrary voted hell . Even main article ban mass voted american heavy subs 

I care votes . affect life way. .
This sub special hatred towards Indians. positive news comments filled skepticism condescending . negative news thousand votes . India's government probably accept help anyone, since it'll ruin deception everything fine. Indians love proud things contributed nothing distant associations India. Kamala Harris family India marriage outside caste, would probably kicked community ridiculed everyone. Im propably last comment post. easily tell looking social media. Indian social media filled heartbreaking pleas sick family members loved ones. 

Here US, also easy find people covid. Like people directly know yourself, even go friend friend level find people who's infected. wife's boss came couple months ago. Early pandemic parents' neighbor nurses, got infected, one even passed. Affected people everywhere US.

My laws live China social circle dozens, maybe hundreds people. friends colleagues also people regularly touch with, living parts China. people literally know single person covid. right now, ever. probability Chinese person living Hunan province knows someone covid close zero. Damn learn anything could help like neighbor stop this. lol posted somewhere else sons college, ten percent population wore masks cold flu season thats finals break time are. years now. 

Smart move. Trump saint compared lmao fuck lakh? probably getting downvoted that's relevant topic.  people die instead breathing Chinese oxygen. (btw, indian here) world never worn masks time. still person person contact spreads flu. wrong. could travel world long spitting others mouth. grow third arm 

Well, juggling supply companies elated increase sales. need mandate: 

1. get flu (usually) dont get everyone need mask. 
2. Flu contagious would need mask high risk setting. 

I also really want socially accepted. India changed laws send HCQ 2020 then. good thing Russia's helping, bad time reveal true allies all. Well ironic. never stopped helped flu Asia. check Flunet compare countries, mask mandates flu disappeared. Same, know one non-elderly person vaccinated doctor. getting them? Where? last statistic saw 7% fully vaccinated. rest world vested interest helping India get control asap. humanity pov also 50% infection rate, virus going mutating wildly. could bad news everyone. particulate worth filtering saturate N95.

I used lot work spray painting woodworking college, used length masks' life, using outer mask, cloth like bandana Bit cop out. Outside forces shouldn’t interfere matters according RW he’d like give opinion every international matter Dictatorship. Flurona. like it. mean like it. 2 (wave), might 10 waves Twitter private company, abide country's laws. 

Facebook Twitter blocked content hours days number countries due election laws. Masks never helped stop flu limit spread Asia.

Masks impact rhinovirus normal seasonal levels everywhere.

New Zealand mask mandates since September virtually zero coronavirus zero flu.

The yearly strains flu come Asia rainy seasons country. spreads rest world. 

Quarantines travel restrictions probably limited spread flu coronaviruses. Meanwhile UK we're holding firm strictly indoor visitors May 17 earliest. I'm same. problem stuff, keep mask certain areas. I'd probably go large gathering though people vaccinated, time am, case numbers fairly low. Besides certain allowed, 110% safe. would funny weren’t silencing real people. UK world leaders seeing dramatic reductions cases/deaths. US 65 populations. Seems lot evidence vaccines According Segal's calculations, since Israel's last infection peak mid-January 98% fewer cases, 87% fewer deaths. Around 85% population 16 years old already vaccinated form immunity previous infection, data shows.

""Life close pre-covid,"" last week."" This. Also Czechia 40 % positivity whole winter. 

Covid testing ≠ random sampling japan, combo vaccines actually illegal reason

No tdap, mmr, must taken separately Forget vaccines. India manufacture vaccines. USA banned vaccine raw material export India evil. according Biden. banned every raw material India. Modi worse 45. Whereas Trump inept evil, Modi evil smart.  arguments always seem kind stupid me. Twitter forum, aren’t posting opinions. It’s people making comments breaking law, Twitter itself. don’t think held accountable legally speaking content people post. put massive piece paper street, people wrote offensive things it, would fault? 


From moral viewpoint subject criticism users, wanted could potentially censor certain tweets based that. it’s slippery slope. USA biggest villain banning exports raw material vaccine production India. sub gone downhill past 6 months whatever.  Noticable decline. I’m personally worried getting post-vaccine won’t prioritizing “staying home much possible” two weeks post-second dose passed, I’m gonna continue wearing mask capacity avoiding large gatherings least rest year.

If one variants blows point evade vaccines, might consider “hunkering down” again. Cases undercounted. infection low. They're sub. try (I 100% subreddit’s policy posting links youtube comments). found humidity/water small effect, alcohol kills filter media. also doesn’t go detail ways try lengthen lifetime beyond measured (ie outer mask change things) stopping vaccinations Americans 
Stop treating zero sum game. 
Share tech manufactured world. world worst week Covid. 
This many experts aid orgs like Amnesty International fighting for. 
Anyway done convo made point much left say. SII paying AZ license though AZ willingly licensed SII every right profit. proper transaction said shouldn’t matter. India asking WTO fee, zero cost IP wavier tech transfer mRNA.  Lol, exactly 21 day-isolation upon arrival. Flu vaccines help one season. build herd immunity naturally vaccines strains around every year. new strain flu arrives rainy seasons Asia people spread around globe mainly air travel, past ship.

Next year, new strain flu give new version flu vaccine. Repeat cycle every year.

Quebec actually stopped vaccinating people flu Quebec's flu vaccination campaign coming end Friday next-to-no flu vaccinate resources instead redirected inoculating residents COVID-19. 

The flu still happened countries Asia, originates. Vietnam usual H3N2 flu 2020. check Flunet.

So something different get rid flu. thing probably quarantines travel restrictions. outside, mean India, might bad news you. variant detected Israel, UK Belgium I'm wrong, USA too...
The ability control variant would country. I'm concerned efficacy vaccines duration.. sure doubt people would want commit stay party till 5am. Also sure many people would want guests till 5am, talking private gatherings clubs all. expediency mean there's urgency extenuating circumstances (i.e. benefits outweigh risks), sure that's EUA given expediency. can't speak others, I'm certainly disingenuous say experimental. vaccines still EUA literally never completed long term trials, required fully understand safety vaccine. thus, still experimental studied, parallel EUA. act short term side effects thing matters. Granted, agree tons data (with Pfizer leading pack), close final approval since first trials Pfizer Moderna started last July. reality data today still provided (as far aware), let alone reviewed approved. Therefore, see anyone argue longer experimental. Unless source help point to? I'm certainly open wrong one facts back up. Racist. immune system definitely stronger, virus mutated infect quickly. USA banned raw material export India manufactures vaccines world. Lolz. think getting it! made sure 5g signal working correctly v2 firmware update

I want deal rma, seems complicated Guess time prepare. LOT indoor air quality experts recommending throughout pandemic. two house. World politics 101. things go wrong find way blame US. Last year almost Islamic festivals stopped due fear mob protests. Everyone celebrated usual. Hindu celebrations curtailed massively year people cooperated. Kumbh something nothing even armies world. People go without government's permission decade celebration. also strict dates. matter govt says, go according auspicious date set date. mean, never able entirely wipe flu cause ones infect humans also infect animals (if I'm mistaken) animals really like wash hands wear masks unfortunately. years I've using SPF 5000, applying spatula. felt like Tammy Faye Baker, character Robocop. Never could decide. Need Carribean flair. 5G tracking chips hidden masks too. Don’t forget absolutely best answer this! Well know them, hospitalization statistic counts people whose primary diagnosis COVID. I.E. go hospital broke leg test positive, count. can't say certain whether states way. granted method provides accurate ""people sick"" picture, states that, numbers worse.  dumb comment. Covid Cholera. Even CDC finally speaking hygiene theater. haha totally. think healthy, young person built antibodies likely could roll around COVID OK. funny thought though---like could literally spray concentrated COVID nose 100% fine? assume know sure. get vaccinated vaccine less likely work due compromised immune systems.  website isn’t completely reliable especially strains aren’t well-known certain countries. use “Pangolin” essentially model predicts lineage based epidemiological data variant. even state FAQ data makes mistakes different labs around world producing data different rates 95% success rate prediction software. state website “Smaller lineages may lower recall rates due small sample sizes training test set.” feel like CDC’s evidence based data tracker reliable sort thing.  Mmm....masters tone-deaf see. Oh tiredness. Sickness, diahrrea, fever, chills, appetite, vomiting.

Usual stuff. country that’s small portion people. portion big enough get heard. decided take vaccine yesterday debating time. end young kids (one 9 months now, 3) won’t make sick. It’s new generation for. feeling #1 got vaccinated. Thinking worry it, time think realize probably like #2 worried around still #1 frame mind. :-/ I'm wondering - lead herd immunity soon 50% positivity rate actually representative whole population?  
It's funny virus works India. get vaccines, get virus reach herd immunity. I'm highly convinced happened end first wave. People got virus recovered. time virus hitting people hard, I'm sure - perhaps variant. Shieeet, aware that. Thanks. 99% told BS calm down. think smart rest fool. 

First commented company &lt; delete comment. 

You liberal scared name company understood lying teeth. 🤣

How got know? 

*A company 70% women workforce would first world advertise didn't... 

*A rich techie would never whataboutism rather talk solutions trolling anonymously like case. 

*He least post one thing company particularly workforce found

So good lying, keep up. r/quitYourBullshit pointlessly stockpiling AZ doses using, legal challenges getting countries. I’m sure mean worry them. make life harder get normal, yes. keep levels virus circulating, yes. strain healthcare, yes. Yeah that's thoughts were. #2 could quick basically #1. initial thought #1 walking around like superman getting vaccinated (which I'm assuming many are). dealing symptoms vaccine get thinking corrected I'm superman ""immune"" it. won't. There'll another controversy within week Indians forgotten one.  really worth noting lockdown UK estimated costing £2.5bn day. Europe number likely (at least) 5-10 times that's even accounting future losses fact summer holidays likely curtailed.

All vaccine projects massively underfunded compared benefits costs anything else. Nothing new here, keep moving.  
Gov't India while. really Indian culture thing. burned collective psyche. ""Log kya kahenge"" (what people say) important ""Ise thik karte hai"" (let's fix this). Indian culture needs change.  
Obligatory I'm racist I'm Indian background myself. don’t think COVID serious even doesn’t exist. strong correlation political beliefs getting vaccine. know lot people still skeptical won’t give chance thinking it’s big gov experimenting people brand new 5G technology shit, meanwhile Biden said everyone got shot June get $5k check mail Christmas people would tripping get lol distinction inoculation like pre-Jenner methods treating smallpox (e.g. taking pus smallpox wound deliberately introducing it); whereas using cowpox vaccination weakened form pathogen? think they're jumping gun (FL), honestly people saying Florida doomed months. Ding/Osterholm saying B117 would swallow FL alive. yet...cases flat. huge spikes. India's population density another level. going ongoing problem countries like India Brazil cannot get COVID control. can, will, continue mutate. There's already evidence UK variant far transmissible original, albeit similar lethality. combination increase lethality, reduction vaccine efficacy would bad news globally. India local elections several states, including Delhi, horrific images could seen media. occasion, massive electoral rallies organized. Also, India celebrated Holi (the festival colors) end March without restriction. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:
  
[Vaccine FAQ Part FAQ Part appointment bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* God heart breaking #2, question is--how quickly happen? example, body responds rapidly 

a) never show symptoms 

b) never high viral load thus spread it

Then essentially 1, even though 2. 

However, people going respond robustly either contracting COVID, possibly spreading it. Luckily seems like relatively small group. already late, real case count probably 10x. way stop this, choice isolate India rest world. ocean go make lack plastic straws. problem probably Twitter relies cheap labour India outsource work (I would imagine including censorship work, too, also development).

So cannot withdraw India would lose competitive advantage companies. going weeks, immunizing people would help smooth curve coming weeks months, also single doses efficacy preventing sever covid. understand people think viral vectors ""traditional"". like morons anyone know ever gotten viral vector vaccine lives. Competent genocide suppose? We're catching fast second doses UK.  totally. releasing supplies vaccinating millions americans - 12-15 yr old kids. I'm actually. somebody lives real world. Yes good point. Immunity related corona mean legal context, think #2 correct. 

There certainty gain immunity via vaccination, able contagiate others, even wont get sick; theory suffer milder symptoms capacity spreading disease would lower ;same reason unknown virus affects mildly individuals hard others...

But think (specially mass media) inform correctly spread wrong message person fully vaccinated forget masks whatever he/she wants, lead new frustrations. RIP. stopping flights of. 100,00. 3.49 lakh 349,000. Misinformation opinion though. like vaccines opinion. work misinformation. failing removing misinformation led rise recent conspiracy theories. really interesting Doomerism prevailing narrative sub USA poorly Nov-Jan, things getting lot better USA/UK, sub pleasant, even optimistic place. Definitely Monica Gandhi Dr. Eric Ding point. 

That said, people subs generally LUNCH comes COVID. saw comment hundreds upvotes authoritatively said ""india proves escape variants within weeks, summer MRNA vaccines helpful all. We'll chasing 10-20 years minimum"" . Lmao acual heck wrong redditors? “I hear things walls crazy people”

I saw ILPT sub people moving hate neighbors install nonstop noise-causing chips behind drywall drive neighbors mad. Defence production act previous year....I Indian...this clusterfuck fucking governments responsibilty... one thing expect us export az vaccines hopefully retract defence act soon possible understand suzerain vassal is. There's countries donating doses would actually already late. stage vaccines can't save india, need time people develop immune response vaccines work. predict see nothing noticeable.  discussion surveys done blood suggested herd immunity reached areas. Much like one done Manaus, Brazil shortly also suffered high infection treatment collapse. probability reports gamed positive spin reduce anxiety infections continued. 

India several vaccine options, however fairly significant portion presold licensed product export. Supplies certain precursor ingredients currently restricted export US due nationalized defence production act, difficult acquire globally otherwise.

Oh, see :) Even /r/IndiaSpeaks heavily modded Unsure ask I've hearing various media vaccine often referred ""immunity"". true? feeling technically not. two thoughts I'm trying reconcile (it one)

1) Upon getting vaccine, immune. Unable contract virus. Could roll around giant tub nothing happen.

2) still contract (or find body) body better adept fighting it.

My feeling vaccine technically #2 even though referred vaccine. wrong?

NOTE: wrong place ask please point correct place. Thanks! yeah, mostly India lot over-reaching control digital world via blanket rules sections Information Technology Act. Especially recent changes/amendments/additions, eg. delete it, break Twitter rules. company also need follow local law 'allegedly' breaking local law Act, Twitter revoked access local twitter accounts tweets. use VPN still access tweets. like coming pandemic, killed 127,000 people country, wanting wear mask social distance hurts feelings I'm dumb. miss smiling kissing baby are, example; waiting line.

You wait minutes. 

Otherwise, liable make someone else wave goodbye parents grandparents. even - masks shown notably reduce **your** chance getting infected too.


Remember something: I'm every around you, fart much can. wearing mask, breathing farts filtered way-too-old underwear cheap pants. Anti-maskers enjoy breathing farts. Please get internet country’s falling apart speak Considering blood cloth reports getting banned Denmark reputation already trashed. place rich-asses congregate hobnob. sad yet people still say exist.

Foil hatters make pandemic carry much longer zero chance anyone keeps wearing mask risk flu (and never mandated), best hope people choose aren’t judged hold hope either year long pandemic morons still make fun people wearing masks. going culturally accepted west certain portion braindead. Fine, akin **shorts**. partially cover legs. 

Your claim masks somehow utterly existentially different piece clothing nonsensical can't even provide justification it. started attempts, abandoned know can't.  Exactly, every country waxes lyrical used great, dig history try find time... People going get tested typically ones feel sick, representative whole population. Hating actions government past present justified last 6 months “urges”. Literally nothing else done
Curfews idiotic, leads drunken people early street, insanely crowded public transport closer 10PM everyone rushes home (while drunk adhering distance restrictions) There's criticism, there's self-hatred Trump might inept invested massively vaccines USA reaping benefits from. get wrong, screwed lot things, massive investment vaccines paid off. People could use rewashable ones. I’m agreeing need socially distancing full extent last year. I’d still willing wear mask occasion I’m crowded place like concert airplane. course, Twitter bowed right them. But, America post anything goes leftist agenda, BOOM! Gone! No, (if any) areas got infections high enough rate even consider herd immunity. And, takes 70% people getting infected herd immunity *start* effective this.

And, herd immunity isn't. Humans herd immunity chicken pox (before got vaccine it) - yet kids still got chicken pox. Herd immunity mean people stop getting infected; means massive population-crushing pandemic spike. virus still spreads population, slow burn. fortunate thing everyone would get first handful years life, least affected it. HCQ even anything COVID, pretty stupid Israel also larger percentage minors relative US. Agreed last point, bureaucratic bullshit reason holding onto AZ doses costing lives. seem permanent state allergic reaction moment, example covid vaccination certificates Modi's picture them

And thought nuts Trump signature US stimulus checks. would like think so, I'm sure individuals consulted case. one dose vaccines, probably closer 750,000,000 people vaccinated. thinking there's kajillion countries developing world looking like india two weeks ago. 

Thailand, Honduras, Costa Rica Etc. 

We need offload stupid AZ doses *immediately* need sending actually help avert catastrophe. India already midst catastrophe point anyone can't hide home already exposed virus. send India amount vaccine symbolic gesture vaccines can't bail India out. stopping infected dying now.

All countries starting see infection records broken need vaccines though late too.

I'm incredibly frustrated continue hold AZ doses Americans even want. send them. SEND THEM. nothing liability could saving lives elsewhere point 98% certain never use them. Yes, private companies power want platforms within law. 

The point comply government requests censor information censor, becomes form ""soft"" propaganda information control. 

""Hard"" propaganda controlled information disseminated via government news agency. modern world, people get information private companies, government. 

So, yes, twitter within right comply, they're complicit government efforts blind people truth. hell bdo know side effects arw people dying streets indeed I'm gonna guess amount cases mutations India, there's gonna least 2+ variants vaccine effective with. Link then. Back statement facts. top 10 world total doses administered per capita currently 2nd world doses administered per capita 7 day period countries using highly efficacious approved vaccines Pfizer, Moderna, JJ AZ. well vaccines stop reading media headlines look data. case 9pm early March 2021, woman Sarah Everard walking home night friend.

Alternatives help virus spread pandemic include walk lunch time, getting hour early, flexible hours. recommendation 5 days week, 2 days weekend.

In cases possible, becomes good many outweighing wants few. friend fully vaccinated partially vaccinated husband caught Covid &lt;5 year old son caught daycare.

It dangerous myth kids don’t get sick can’t spread it. sustain this, talking dropping restrictions starts make sense.  \*Modi-ed Lol that's compare  I'm Indian, covid positive right now, isolated. 

I feel privileged home , got medicine kit, steamer , oximeter, even small oxygen cylinder emergency cuz contacts government hospital's doctors.
But honest, went thrice hospital testing. First two tests came.out negative even tho severe symptoms, shouting covid. isolated day 1 getting sick. third test came positive quarantine period initiated time period 17 days. 
I went sister government hospital testing, every time went, put ride home used dead silent conditions their. Parents shouting little kids positive able get hospital bed. much crying pain around makes think PM cares fund last year every indian, whether super rich poor, everyone donated that. , year later, oxygen, ventilators, beds, even enough faculty doctors. pathetic scum politicians, busy organising rallies upcoming West Bengal elections. horrible PM, even wearing masks rallies complimenting people gathering number rallies. 
It really makes think n kind sick monsters chosen country monsters gonna make county hollow inside !

Vaccine read sub think brain exploded delusions sub. want banned sub ever come across again. Wow dont vaccine dont help first?? know would worj guess saying India dirty important reddit evidence based disease transmission. either lying numbers simply can't compile phenomenon appeared happening Lucknow Mirzapur — major cities Uttar Pradesh State — across Gujarat, where, similar period mid-April, authorities reported 73 121 Covid-related deaths detailed count compiled one Gujarat’s leading newspapers, Sandesh, sent reporters cremation burial grounds across state, indicated number several times higher, around 610 day.

Truer words spoken. Weird cuz twitter love donald trump algorithm facebook work twitter lmao 😂😂😂 Weird US bad, didn’t blame rest world.

Nice revisionism here. Ths UK variant 50x transmissible 30% deadlier. I've hearing past months weeks, alright. Good know I'm going crazy. Yep. realized people acting like pandemic they're vaccinated going back partying traveling reopening everything, I've accepted covid big problem US least years. trials almost pointless given Denmark Germany millions people combined received 1st dose Oxford vaccine getting BioNtech Moderna 2nd dose.

Doesn't seem generated controversy either particularly interesting. lacks hygiene

And racist statement make - based scientific studies shown statistical degree confidence.

Sorry India - handwashing bathing game guys. Yeah, China lockdowns time. /s that's knew shit serious  getting downvoted totally correct. exact number think 94-99% covid infections airborne transmission. Washing hands sanitizing groceries makes people feel better anything. That's step far Twitter TBH.

It's one thing silence ""inject bleach lol"" another matter. democratic free speech action, actively suppressed. abide country's laws

It's kinda scary many people thread understand astoundingly simple concept. US stopping India getting oxygen, too? face masks? staying fuck away other? stop self-congratulations? Thousands preventable deaths occurred still occurring EU missmanagement.

Or sarcastic? reality. vaccinated people 60+ know live Saxony, Bavaria, Baden-Württemberg, North Rhine-Westfalia. City size ranges 50.000 1.5 mio. focus personal anecdotes anyway? incapable reading data? vaccination rates, delivery dates, available public since January. Btw. obviously, nobody waits everyone prio 2 vaccinated open prio 3. people every group incapable unwilling get vaccine can't arsed deal process get one. helping cover incompetence

Don't ridiculous. Twitter ""helping"" them. following law. got job? Trolling job dude. 🤣

It's good showed Han bat eater, Good Bye! Yes, understand relieve finally getting vaccinated.

But must forget ""feel safe"" ""be safe""

More worry, would prefer cautious. Norway, Sweden Germany goal. couple days ago Von der Layen said [EU \(as whole\) planned vaccinate 70% adults July nah I'm obviously making shit EU deep trouble. removal criticism happening US based website US company, ""democracy'. situation bad. death numbers cited govt sites fractions actual ones. reduce numbers put show good job. Even Indians themselves. Alright, fun talking chodi bhakt.

I'll leave fun since job unlike you. true, good point 350k+ cases everyday number rising. think already hand? producing much less could since USA blocking export base materials need game was!! I'm happy bomber today! 39% liars. I'm suspicious this

My grandma recently went chemo vaccinated relation viral load / symptoms transmission questionable.

Why asymptomatics still able transmit?

I would cautious saying asymtomatics essentially contagiate.  I'm means virologist, would think 50% infected mutations beneficial virus chance spread far people left without immunity.

Also [*infection defined term meaning probability infection population, many infected. countries offering oxygen India? Surely many countries much better shape? sad    boys! yes. body cannot handle double X every female cell one two gets shut down


this reason X genetic diseases deadly men rather women


 see ""differently"" reason hormones brain develops chances getting COVID low chances getting moderate severe symptoms close zero.

:)

(Your co-worker truly odd immune system...two vaccines natural immunity still gets COVID again) hopefully amount vaccines we’ll ok

If virus spreads freely, chance mutate dangerous version version protected current vaccines (on top sufferings happening surge), understanding right. borders closed new vaccination developed, going cause setback normalcy point time. think best interest world large surges like happen controlled. wish there's international organization helps oversee pandemic measures countries world prohibits countries stupid things like this. Thank God.

If didn't, I'm planning buying safehouse stock up. doesnt mean herd immunity shouldve achieved now? hyperbole haha... left US (sept 2020) people knew (70%) still taking fairly seriously Sadly lot people dug absolutely convinced vaccines either form control used ""the libs,"" delivery systems Bill Gates' fabled mind control nanotech. Thanks world look you? 99% flights open back then, completely different now. believe actually happens. like Schrödinger's bubble, people start talk bursts. awesome! thanks clarification ignorant voters harm many countries people voting asked genuine question... Smh you’re distributing AZ J&amp;J vaccines. They’re sitting warehouses. AZ expire soon. Yep, indian. Got covishield. get minor effects shot.  sick people go testing, means people virus going testing well symptoms already mild and/or asymptomatic.

Well never mind. get I'm wrong write down. Thanks conservative governments stripping funding anything could considered “innovation”, can’t produce vaccines need imports.

We also paid vaccines ahead time, cost help companies get going production, getting due. Vaccines solution point time India. solution extremely harsh lockdown. Like 80% jabs per day going second doses UK… lot countries turned China, refused release research data information efficacy Sinovac vaccine.

I feel sorry people mercy China. surprise past weeks brought flurry leaks revelations Sinovac barely effective.

We're talking country sold billions dollars worth fake COVID tests useless PPE nations and, rather apologize try make right, responded insults threats.

China used opportunity take advantage desperate countries. Nonsense! Come get free Krispy Kreme donut. India? vaccine get? zero immunity Australia. decent outbreak it'll lockdowns again. world also connected, getting anywhere took long time people travelling travel.

The world, country, populations much smaller much smaller populationdensity many places. easy try compare, 1918 flu massively difficult ""achieve"" circumstances lot ways. cares? long get shot end this, don’t care someone’s reasoning deciding brand is.

The true morons ones refuse get vaccinated all. Everyone Netherlands get first vaccine July. think back normal 2 years? semi normal summer holiday possible year. Wanting reduce occurrence side effects could also drive people toward single shot vaccine since they’d go once.  Florida? Seems like Florida everyone else... Well I’m 33 side effects sore arm YMMV well dense politicians German engineering (BioNTech) US supply chain (Pfizer)


^^^^and ^^^^single ^^^^payer ^^^^vaccination ^^^^so ^^^^no-one ^^^^has ^^^^to ^^^^worry ^^^^about ^^^^cost

Pretty nice combination! confirm: American, extremely vaccinated. Fucking wash. Your. Hands. Even Covid primarily airborne, poor hygiene lead infections tax immune system make harder fight Covid infection, making likely spread, making likely require extra medical attention- something India struggling provide now.  That's going problem going forward, western countries hellbent returning manufacturing critical supplies like pharmaceuticals within borders.

No one wants subject mercy China next time happens, **it happen again**, rest world can't even stop bickering long enough put international pressure China come clean origins virus, China change behavior.

Even though India ally, politician wants one opposes bringing crucial manufacturing back home. Look number infected China. Also India borders China Himalayas border without people movement. That's true vaccine sites half empty, went one recently, full. late, indian variant found belgium already, likely countries europe. Norway estimate 90% get first dose 95% get second dose, certainly sound ordinary. imagine combination people don’t time don’t want take time, people severe side effects first dose people simply think one dose enough. Thinking it’s migraine. Thanks input India? Id really like hear first hand accounts. Anyone? focus positive tests? hope don’t get seriously ill, don’t get positive test. Positive test could totally asymptomatic sniffles.

The chance major complications Covid vaccinated incredibly low — virtually zero. let Indian government silence twitter.

I believe would. political fallout would much worse currently is. degree, think China's also run populist leader. (yes, fcked beginning, etc)

I guess difference ""not scared pesky virus"" vs ""use every iron fisted method possible crush virus"" expect restrictions lifted July meaning refused get vaccinated can't get vaccinated act like fully vaccinated 2 days since first dose likely create small wave going enjoying lifted restrictions. comment linking independent.co.uk automatically removed source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Globally people tested symptoms, exposed position take periodic tests. tests typically people currently lack symptoms get tested positivity rate skyrockets. mean, India metric crap ton religious festivals, government ended restrictions allowed large gatherings, people began weddings again...

Those decisions India's government, US. Anyone brain would known country 1.4 billion, virtually investment medical infrastructure resources, would powder keg health system would easily collapse.

**And since we're talking Indian government's failures, want help, first step honest number new cases deaths.**

India's COVID numbers never made sense. rate testing India abysmal, death numbers make sense, especially country poor medical care, government massaged numbers appear lower. 

Meanwhile news reports include compelling evidence undercounts severe 1/5 1/25 real numbers. combine lack testing, likely India excess 500,000 new cases day, probably much more.

Yes wear mask legally required, otherwise. Actually need around 10-12 billion make work.

Wrestlemania (larger attendance UFC)

The Superbowl (also larger attendance)

Early Results won’t start till September though.  transmissible, spread like wildfire even without significant immune / vaccine escape, especially since vaccination rates India low there'd barely effect point (below 10%).

I think spread heavily influenced circumstances behavior rather variant much terrible variants. India pretty packed, population density insane hygiene conditions ideal large parts country. Mask-wearing common nation-wide regulations, especially last couple months. People essentially thought pandemic thing past first wave ended everything went mostly back normal. There's tons protests religious ceremonies people gathered masses. creates perfect conditions true exponential growth, we're seeing.

That said, variant likely plays part, especially transmissible. probably going ""the"" variant destroy us, makes sense.

I know controllable situation India really is. feel like point probably ""ride out"" wait till cases go own, obviously that's terrible lead lot deaths. hope find way control start vaccinating people quickly First definition pandemic, second HIV right classified pandemic. limited ways could be, little different type situation isn't. given name global epidemic instead something like that. else phrase it? actually lack hygiene based purely facts 4 monthly doses per arm  true.

On top that, companies making mRNA vaccines since Trump even elected. already working multiple mRNA vaccines MERS.

Here go projection side effects fucking joke dude. outdoor concert Manhattan **yesterday**. reached turning point New York. Indeed, difficult imagine bad headlines would right president Trump sitting raw materials stage tantamount vaccine hoarding. somehow became political thing.

There's mystery there?  

The last President felt ""downplay"" pandemic (for politicial reasons) party spreading misinformation ever since. Sorry, clarified I'm U.K. I'm US, New York State specifically. far know specific numerical guidelines lifting restrictions frustrating be. vague hints ""when reach herd immunity"", ranges (our experts saying) probably 60-80% adults vaccinated, one clarifying number deaths/hospitalizations/new cases need hit per day start loosening things up. occasionally lifting stuff seems clarification they've chosen raise capacity 25% whatever.

And clear, I'm anti-mask, Covid denier. I'm fully vaccinated, etc. think time lay clear metrics ""when mark reached, lift this"" rather vague decided. UK specific metrics place? opinion, statement factually wrong easily demonstrated quite simply government hadn’t stockpiled enough PPE despite numerous past warnings would reflect poorly them. Luckily I, I’m sure many others critical thinking skills know saying utter bullshit.

What said accurate time, changed information changed. end ideas, person. Calmly effectively state points, highlight logical fallacies etc. That’s bud.

You mean like accurate reasonable first response, responded ""You keep telling yourself"" type response dismissing clearly researched anything. going act superior wrong, surprised people give crap respond you. Preach Vaxxed tits! civilized cause money refrigerated trucks? Uh, ok. Yep, know people like also. They've going work entire pandemic (essential workers) Covid also. can't bothered deal fear Covid all. also see connection vaccination normalcy

If bring J&amp;J people, we'll bump numbers pretty rapidly. say start taking job sites apartment complexes.  Nah herd immunity natural infections pretty much guaranteed wipe virus out. reason approach ""herd immunity"" infections slow means rise immunity also slows. kind reach equilibrium infections big spikes exponential growth (apart possibly small pockets immunity lower whatever reason, example certain viruses permanent immunity infection spread amongst children since pre-existing immunity)

Why think coronaviruses like ones cause common cold eradicated? immunity population always asymptote towards level r=1 go normal day day lives. especially true infections immunity fades life-long dosage changes children. 

If antivax idiots right anything, ""we started administration vaccine fast data on""... changing dosage differences weight/sex/age. really big problem mRNA vaccines others, hey. home state (Jalisco, México) outdoor events weddings, graduations, etc 300 person capacity including staff outdoor restaurants bars nightly curfews, but, nightclubs, casinos, stripclubs operate 100% capacity, meaning nightclubs could (and already do) host thousand people extremely packed indoor venue, anyone else think incredibly dumb? Someone tell Premier Ontario.... least two papers suggesting potential problems (none vivo) spike protein could lead issues heart muscle and/or circulatory problems. can't ruled out, ultimately may affect people, theory vaccination deltoid different terms systemic viral load (as meaningful absence), compared infection covid, hopefully see issues...and issues, well, they're going worse covid itself. Many countries prioritizing elderly risk people vaccinations rather opening everyone. even though country might 20% least dose mean 20% every day people coming contact vaccination. Much second/third wave propagated younger populations small portion vaccines.

So see shift vaccines reducing cases weeks general public starts receiving doses.  might super smart experience disease control almost anytime else America what? got first shot Pfizer past Saturday reading post title: Oh no!

Me going comments: is. Acceptable. That’s true shouldn’t getting downvoted. Covid running rampant country 1.4 billion increases risk variant emerging reduces vaccine efficacy. definitely cause concern.  I'm pretty sure saw video Indian politician trying heal covid patient cow urine. refreshing think politicians proactive fighting disease understand that. However, point, approaching rapidly, vaccinated ones want vaccinated remainder individuals want vaccinated get vaccinated.  Hopefully vaccines strong ones vaccinated affected ones aren't, living no-mans-land restrictions going work much longer fully vaccinated (myself included) folks. source that? Good. hope remember reading somewhere eventually decided it. read many things days could mixing things lol. many ways life safely return resemblance normalcy soon enough, hit vaccine-induced herd immunity.

It would nice politicians would actually *talk* normalcy. no, still cling mask mandates. Hell, county (49% w/one dose) talking going 75% capacity businesses 60% vaccination.

States localities far cautious good chunk refuse even discuss full-on back normal. wanna motivate hesitant lazy? Talk normal. government India grossly mismanaged response intentionally held enormous superspreader rallies. probably many people take Covid seriously, swathes uneducated masses government's response. Covid gone! died first wave. Thank answer. Maybe rename Boca Bash B.1.1.7 CDC. Updated yesterday, 4/24: 87 million fully vaccinated, 5,079 symptomatic breakthrough infections. That’s 0.005%. Chance struck lightning US 0.006%. recent studies suggesting lower rates: 3 days ago think happens can't take vaccine religious medical reason? I’m disputing that. implied work well, wasn’t intent. protection accurate description. said - it’s realistic point expect return pre-pandemic behaviors IMO. may best policy - day day experience indicates it’s least area wants. sensible part world, get people walking around without masks someone gets infected know could mitigated masks.

Not USA tho, capital ""I'll Sue You"".

""Oh CDC said absolutely safe go around without masks! sue make millions now!"" \*cough cough\* \*dies\* study China last winter found 0.3% traced transmissions occurred outdoors.

Worst case scenario several months covid plaguing India roll vaccines

Obvious main concerns being, considering India STILL border border lockdown, virus allowed undergo mutations increasingly fast pace

In words, point India pose threat USA’s incredible vaccination progress? lot first surge didn’t enough staff trained use properly, IIRC. specifically intubators. CDC still recommends ventilator types insufficient. Smart. would people that?! Didn’t EU say going sue? agree disappointing, think many different ""priority"" groups time add up, population. Almost everyone know vaccinated opened April 19.

However, think 50-60% getting vaccinated going enough end virus spread year. large percentage, anywhere 10% 40%, exposed probably immune. Add groups account overlap think we're there. Look man. I’m you. wish everyone would get vaccine. can’t force them. don’t want adequate access it. That’s them. I’m responding saying well never reach herd immunity without vaccines. Herd immunity inevitable, reach either vaccines without. Hopefully former   Good. I'm looking forward relocation scouting trip Portugal. Want escape America ASAP. know virus slows summer - TX FL already full summer mode, baseball games outside (and wear mask inside/going bathroom etc), counties still restrictions place...all plus vaccines natural immunity means cases going go down, everywhere else country next weeks, even things opening up. lot people sub also saying October take vaccine longterm data. wish set remind notifications see people changed tune. Yep, look encouraging. bummer we're likely 10-15% short true herd immunity tools achieve it. saying.

(See [this news section ""Will vaccines still work variants?"" links [this real-world shows variants-of-concern breakthrough infections vaccinated people, mass vaccination non-pharmaceutical interventions still help.)

Long version. 

The finish line blurry. Maybe vaccinated new strain emerges vaccine got protect well against. Though mostly vaccines seem broadly effective, AZ versus SA strain notable exception. 

But time I'd say finishing line is: everyone offered chance get effective vaccine. 

Hopefully also means everyone vaccine vaccine shot. won't, it. vaccinated accepted small risk major vaccine side effects. get vaccinated accept relatively larger risk serious consequences get virus.

Even without vaccination, treatment improved greatly since early stages. keep disease level control social measures increasingly vaccination hospitals cope. case numbers low, even infected deaths extremely rare.

Once social measures (travel restrictions quarantine) removed herd immunity rapidly achieved. People vaccine disease. simple.

Note ""regardless symptom status"" part, includes asymptomatic infections. real world conditions, 90% vaccinated healthcare workers #1, 10% #2. vaccinated healthcare workers were, say, wearing masks singing patients time, would expect see ratio change get breakthrough infections.

Duh everyone knows. /S comment said, 70% fully vaccinated means like 85%, around 75% available population least one shot 60% full treatment Add people who've already passed COVID got vaccinated (those knew asymptomatic) probably 80% total population antibodies. people actually EU. median age India around 28 years, EU lot elderly fragile population.

There's 1.3 billion people India. 104 million aged 60 according last census. 

Average mean much there's 100 million people high risk, covid affect younger remember. health system collapsing. BBC article too.

[Covid-19: UK sends supplies India amid record virus surge - BBC see, hope too. forget 41 trillion guys stole us. Decentralisation. Daily number cases predicted reach half million May 1st week taking USA perspective since live there.

Looking overall vaccination rates (e.g. 95% fully vaccinated school age children) think ultimately get high take up, particularly mRNA vaccine doses available.

With India recording 340,000 new Covid-19 cases, Cambodia confirming 600 last 24 hours Laos’s daily tally surpassing Vietnam’s highest 82 cases January 28, health ministry ""very anxious,"" Long said.

The new ""double mutant"" variants India U.K. variant Cambodia transmissible pose greater risk community transmissions.

On Sunday, HCMC Pasteur Institute confirmed 85.7 percent infected samples taken imported Covid-19 cases Cambodia contain U.K. variant, 14.3 percent South African variant.

""The global pandemic situation shows new outbreaks often larger, stronger devastating previous ones,"" Long said.

""The health sector prepared scenario widespread local outbreaks, especially Mekong Delta region,"" minister said, adding ministry preparing worst case scenarios like undetected infections community.

Over last months, National Steering Committee Covid-19 Prevention Control Health Ministry warning new outbreak country many people entered country illegally others dropped guard.

Vietnam’s first coronavirus wave struck January February last year, epicenter northern province Vinh Phuc. second wave, struck July August, centered central city Da Nang City, third one earlier year northern provinces Hai Duong Quang Ninh well Ho Chi Minh City.

The Mekong Delta, four provinces Giang, Dong Thap, Kien Giang Long share borders Cambodia, named potential Covid-19 hotspot.

People arriving Cambodia held border station Vietnams Giang Province, March 2021. Photo courtesy Giang border guards.

As Vietnam tightens border controls land, controlling illegal entrance sea remains challenge, Long said.

He advised people strictly adopt prevention measures report illegal entry local authorities.

""We suggest localities ramp surveillance detect new infections early. prepare scenarios outbreaks spreading community, ready act without fumbling,"" Long said.

While Vietnam sealed borders, occasional illegal entrants evade checkpoints avoid mandatory quarantine. Several foreigners also caught entering country illegally.

As per protocol, everyone entering nation must quarantined 14 days, he/she tested least twice.

Vietnam gone two months without Covid-19 community transmissions. believe ones dying age 40. majority people coming COVID 60 years age. Yes, contracts signed 6-12 months ago vax manufacturers prohibit US giving selling countries. able get around “loaning” couple million Canada Mexico. I’m sure could case well, regardless, it’s much complicated simply putting plane sending along, unfortunately. believe they’re trying renegotiate manufacturers don’t know timeline logistics that. Curious see infection rate half vaccinated person vs fully vaccinated person. Extrapolation context would mean pace inreases time, remains flat. could absolutely correct. watch happens make formal plans situation changes. Pretty much every metric collapsed. Hospitalizations city around 55%. Shame. Second dose 5g fully picks up. going article vaccinated person gets COVID? US extended medical assistance like UK, EU. Instead made statement India: ""It's interests world see Americans vaccinated (first)"" - Ned Price.

Hurtful + bad diplomacy. Vientiane (VNA) - Lao National Steering Committee COVID-19 Prevention Control April 25 announced country confirmed 76 new locally-infected COVID-19 cases, including 64 cases Vientiane capital city, lifting national tally 323.

So far, 16 18 Lao provinces cities applied lockdown curfew measures.

Vientiane said hotspot second wave COVID-19 outbreaks country.

A representative steering committee said press conference areas Vientiane risk infection.

People capital city demanded stay home leave houses urgent cases, time strictly follow disease prevention regulations.

The Lao Ministry Health also encouraged people continue get COVID-19 vaccinations. opened online vaccination registration system local people foreigners living Laos.

Vientiane’s steering committee COVID-19 prevention control day said city ready aspects, terms manpower, quarantine facilities, hospitals equipment, cope pandemic.

Laos far reported deaths related COVID-19.

Meanwhile, 11 deaths confirmed Thailand last 24 hours, raising toll 140, according Centre COVID-19 Situation Administration (CCSA).

CCSA said country reported total 55,460 COVID-19 cases since pandemic began, including 2,438 infections past 24 hours.

To prevent pandemic spreading, Bangkok authorities ordered closure parks, gymnasiums, movie theaters kindergartens April 26 May 9. Shopping centres remain open, Thai Retailers Association limited opening hours Bangkok 17 provinces./. Kolkata adult population 10 million seeing test positive rates 50% hundreds deaths per day. 20M AZ doses sitting American warehouses could vaccinate entire city 2 doses, whole city 1 dose plus equal sized city well. 

Will take weeks see effect, yes. 4-6 weeks would saving literally thousands lives week. amount ventilators PPE effect. 

I'm saying send ventilators - need now, sure - nothing compare long-term impact vaccines, even close.

Btw Canada speeding vaccinations US slowing down. bet countries reach approximately 60% 70% vaccinated around time. think pandemic almost multitude studies confirmed this. needs plastered every billboard shouted every news show. COVID’s arguably biggest transmission factor could transmit without symptoms. longer true you’re vaccinated, there’s reason keep anything closed good amount population received jabs. Inactivated vaccine 2 doses uh oh. Agreed, already mentioned [another nursing care already brutally expensive, improving wages add minimally cost. main cost undoubtedly shareholder profits. Staying home afraid go gym rocket science. One primary problems Canada limited availability financial support kind scientific research. Ontario gave major cutbacks. Science/scientific research essential important. one advanced industrialized countries, scientist available manufacturing expertise facilities least three provinces (three different vaccines) able step beginning pandemic. suggestion three (minimum) based one facility east coast, central Canada west coast. sure 40% actually it, main reason politics. 

In USA (probably countries), tend ascribe much power president :) things going well, president hero, things going bad, president's fault.

When COVID started, Mr Trump president, (and Republicans') best interest minimize it, make seem things bad; that's (and political partisans same).

The vaccination campaign picked Mr Biden president, Republicans' political interest minimize effects vaccine, maximize perceived impact COVID.

Depending ask question, people may interpreting 'are member Republican team', 40% voters (sad, true :) I'm fully vaccinated still wearing kn95/kf94 religiously making seasonal allergies far tolerable. kf94s gave mom allowing visit father previously allergies cat prevented able visit home. Good news :) Yeah pretty soon they’ll go back looking excuses haven’t left mom’s basement. Covid might still exist we’ll vaccines action necessary. mean US, places different , I'm afraid move political idiots . Let's face it: usual idiots anti-vaccine stuff, we're new idiots following politician's dream re-election way ran get vaccine tried hide it.

Now tell think new idiots listen to. Dude, already looking longingly New Zealand, gorgeous vistas, burgers beets egg them, interesting vowel phonemes, what's like Completely. Think Ebola that’s contagious week symptoms show. dude saying increase deaths time due lack O2 patients severe symptoms. Many would saved O2 available . fck would subreddit believe Covid?? firm believer presence covid 19 . graduated college, granted skin teeth still Similar experience albeit opposite direction. used weigh healthy 188 6’ slowly made way 160. understand shit. clicked expecting step forward public policy CDC recommendations, article still ends think period pandemic’s completely control drop recommendation recommend certain situations,” Dr. Scrase said still need see improvements two areas get get there, we’ll lot New Mexicans vaccinated we’ll lot, lot lower case count finally get frontier. I’m looking forward it, I’m sure it’s gonna be,” said.

This position literally makes sense. 2 minute article, say ""hardly anybody"" vaccinated catching spreading coronavirus, also we're changing recommendations masking/distancing vaccinated people uhhh... there's still lot cases.

Wtf? NEED something this. normal person going look best assume know fuck they're doing, worst assume they're actively malicious and/or vaccine pointless. know. asking guidelines go since fully vaccinated case covid-19. vaccinated 3 months guidelines case this. That's question have. Breakthrough infections astoundingly rare happen.

Do confirmed instances infecting anyone else? strong guess would even rarer.

Either way, rare negligible public health point view. brain fog day second Pfizer dose, pressure head felt like moderate seasonal allergy day. Vaxed Friday morning, stuffy stupid Saturday, totally fine Sunday. That's horrible. really hope see relief soon. can't imagine helpless providers feel. Canada purchased plenty vaccines population. Also vaccination program speeding US slowing yes healthcare system superior. citizens live longer healthier lives go hospital get something small checked becomes problem. America people wait health issues become critical get attention even lot avoid ambulance. Canada one eighth population US wonder cant produce product like covid vaccine level. Vietnam another shining example, far Birth control causes increased risk ischemic stroke, caused clot brain. That's I'm referring 'bigger risks already birth control"" Actual good news would ""People largely changed behaviors prioritize collective community well-being personal freedoms."" obvious: Science saved asses. problem hesitancy created environment tons people genuinely believe vaccine stop getting covid, spreading it.

It's funny, Fauci happy lie teeth masking, confirm good news without half dozen studies.

The organization culture leadership CDC insane gutted thrown out. shredded credibility early on, made continuous obvious stupid blunders, massively upped global death toll so.

I hope realize internally, hundred thousand bodies hands. “Basic” R&amp;D PoC hardly easily reproducible . Company R&amp;D commercialization robustness matters. People academics tend assume R&amp;D matters academic. It’s BS. academic research trifles compared quality privately financed. exhort buddy, PRC, step help world inoculate mess unleashed upon us. There’s gonna reason restrictions want vaccinated. know places gonna try bullshit people meeting vaccination percentage reality we’ve almost completely vaccinated easily largest vulnerable group, elderly. We’re point we’re giving want it, couple months everyone able get one easily, restrictions need go. Yeah partner made walk 2 hours every night. slacking walking winter trying much indoor stuff could. It’s definitely gonna harder commuting again, that’s 2-3 hours lost every day. I’m gonna make work cus feel much better used to. don’t want go back used feel. truly think death rate COVID-19 low enough large swaths population could basically ignore it. CFR 3-4% turned real death rate across ages think people would taken seriously, worn masks, etc. Sorry, elaborate cured? saying paper details potential cure Cov-SARS-2? data different depending study. Israel data suggest much protection two weeks, might recipients relaxed precautions soon risky behavior cancelled vaccine benefits, ""After initial injection case numbers increased day 8 declining low levels day 21. **Estimated vaccine effectiveness pretty much 0 day 14 rose 90% day 21 levelling off.** cause initial surge infection risk unknown may related people less cautious maintaining protective behaviours soon injection."" data, original vaccine trial data healthcare worker research, suggest protection 65%-80%+ zone. reasonably conclude you’re illiterate exhort buddy, PRC, step help world inoculate mess unleashed upon us. don’t think finished somehow... dont really know say anymore. pessimistic death toll covid19 around 600,000 US lives lost... death toll sitting quite worrying 571,000 still climbing (albeit much slower last year).... guess end sit 580,000, hate say something like that, get extremely upset seeing innocent lives needlessly lost. response failed, much general population learned? bet little nothing all. need far comprehensive education prepare us whatever comes next There's trial Liverpool moment. started I'm sure long take data. exhort buddy, PRC, step help world inoculate mess unleashed upon us. looks lot like one manufactured news pieces runs slight variations nightly newscasts across country. little detail involved, probably treated propaganda news. 

I'm pro vaccine, anti-bullshit take random news reports face value. someone strong immune response flu shot year, plus pretty bad day second Pfizer, I'd personally get separate lmao. Even thinking combined brings back chills.

But maybe older population experiences fewer side effects, might effective strategy. way could though might true AZ blood clot issue India stopping exports Serum Institute.

Novavax likely start delivery July likely scrape target. AZ going almost exclusively second doses Pfizer + Moderna provide deliveries. AZ might restricted 40s instead 30s blood clot incidence found 1/125,000 occurs would wait novavax something else either vaccinate 18-40 year olds.

I would bet end close July target given problems we've encountered recently ""lucky"" covid death rate historically deadly diseases.

It made virulence.  2020 worst year deaths America's history, eclipsing two world wars even 1918 Influenza epidemic.  (Your regional stats may vary.). Nothing ever killed many countrymen short time. would first say anyone fan Didi Gregorious entitled opinion anything, addition that, population China higher 1990 1980, higher 2000 1990, higher today 2010. I’m disagreeing you, I’m saying argument invalid. Whatever thing would like claim instituted, answer didn’t work, know people ten years ago, ten that, ten that, forever backwards. need less kids. goodness sake, India too. people make mad. still get reason whole thing still ongoing people like taken seriously.

It's still deal this. whole world locked two months perhaps 3 months tops, whole thing would over. transissions, virus. nope, 1 year later still stupid debates. Every time numbers start go down, politicians open fear wrath anti-lockdown folks. goes again, another lockdown, open soon again, again. I'm going crazy endure stupidty humanity.

I want actual strict lockdowns want things end quickly, want live like another year. sinovac single dose?  migraine headache next day, nurse triage hotline okayed take ibuprofen. says Acetaminophen ibuprofen, aspirin. War ja klar 😏 Starting two weeks out, first dose immunity. Multiple studies shown around 80% vaccinated cuts viral load transmission 75% (in worst case scenario) 100% (best case scenario). intents purposes, you’re fully vaccinated, won’t spread it. fuck Pfizer, helped biotech study produce vaccine developed (German company), somehow ensure thaat US gets ""dibs"" vaccines headquartered there. main state investment Germany EU looking like we'll get AIDs vaccine too?  Wisconsin  haven’t enough people infected Sars1, guess. fact COVID-19 incredibly well adapted humans is...remarkable. spot on. CDC clearly running clock here. guys keep getting press there's ton evidence absolute bullshit. Ok Malthus. Im laughing wrong, Chinas population shrinking rapidly indias one levelling off. really worried non issue ""over population"", youd talking Africa going experience population explosion real soon. First dose Mexico: 9.4% 


First dose Canada: 29%

Don't much care crocodile tears. read report next season's selection vaccine. B lineages pretty set stone, B/yamagata nearly disappeared (unfortunately seem gone extinct, sooo close)

H3N2 seems diversity, that's case every year H3N2 hardest vaccinate there's usually multiple distinct subclades circulating. often usually one people get despite seasons flu shot frequent mismatching whatever circulating (among issues)

H1N1 potential wildcards part vaccine H1N1 virus selected give broad coverage. get statistic online school enrollment? 

Where live (OR) decide commit fully online Hybrid last August. 

Only half hybrid kids actually returned school. 

The online program popular also permanent part curriculum going forward, students able opt self guided learning instead returning classroom. testing centers closed entire staff tested positive. Rather testing numbers better monitor ""official"" deaths &amp; positivity rate. at-least correlate situation. Eradicated outside bioweapons labs.

Where people keep incredibly stupid experiments figure weaponize it, figure defend that.

Therefore neatly getting around prohibitions bioweapons research, massively upping risk we'll unmitigated disaster.

I sort see keeping sample neither test whether something smallpox, needed make new vaccines from

But otherwise, getting rid every sample makes us infinitely safer. Sure, rogue state hang onto one, eventually we'll get samples too. Where? actually over. month behind Israel. Deaths begin plummet shortly approach 50% vaccinated. It’s simple math. Glad least people forgotten chronology events. deniers love say China warn us early enough. truth globally made public back January 2020. China lockdowns then, do? waited mid March sorts lockdowns. opened early, people take anymore wanted make holidays. love downvoted slightest hint negativity even though incorrect. 1.	Thanks!
2.	Oh yeah know sure. ability stay home. also partner militant making us walk 2 hours every single night. Every single night! feet hurt much awhile lol also basically intermittent fasting unintentionally trying discover food allergy. probably malnourished. entirely true. cases nursing home need look closer. vaccine highly effective mitigation like seatbelts highly effective mitigating measure prevent physical harm and/or death. Aside people immunocompromised otherwise unable gain effective immunity vaccines, sure. COVID age far biggest factor though, I've responding guy wrote ""and world stands watches it"". Seems like guy putting expectations up, me. sinovac Well research article makes interesting claims relating case history typical human behavior indoors justify assumption. probably simpler that, though: residence time poorly-ventilated space longer typical time air mixing, well-mixed assumption unreasonable.

Doesn't mean imperfect, well-mixed assumption (and research paper does) give sense approach ventilation outflow well limit number potential sources particles (humans case). 

I think there's definite merits worth considering here, usual oversold headlines making bullshit claims frankly wrong. interview author help, though. Dude says things CNBC say peer-reviewed research paper. many people covid vaccine? Like what’s logic behind it? 40% Americans it?  Yes, 2 days per week. Guns contagious proven time guns actually increase chances victim gun violence. Yeah UK really puzzled about, I’m hoping Canadian government provides updates it’s one largest contracts.     still don’t think 1 20,000 correct. hope is! You’re bigger us. reversed population GDP numbers, we’d wouldn’t. Yes, getting vaccine doesn’t make 100% immune getting infection stated article, many times trials studies (symptomatic asymptomatic) therefore getting vaccine doesn’t mean can’t spread virus. convention that? Gg 5 percent people pfizer/moderna vaccine protect AZ even applied EUA? I’m pretty sure haven’t. 60-70 percent adults gonna get vaccine plus fewer children definitely way less sound like moron. hear insurance kinda events super expensive rn We're going need boosters six months so. would foolish give away pfizer moderna right now. AZ understand we're using it. giving away need months exactly EU india got messes. Unpopular opinion know I’ve thrown temper tantrum since day 1 mask fiasco...still got shot. looks worse. Article says 1 20k young men risk myocarditis end June, we'll see yet another unfulfilled commitment reality. understand morally good export countries deep need, I'd (admittedly selfishly so) rather vaccine child first neighbor's. two “in nutshell” pretty good. Positivity rate also crashing, 4 again. I’m always kind surprised too. I’m “give shots” camp. traveled extensively developing world work prior I’ve vaccinated quite “rare west” diseases flu shot nothing.  Good thing there's vaccines better outcomes. worry let people live life? everyone wants stay locked house forever, go eat want to. I'm right ya! world needs it. ""Oh shit, wrong,"" also, ""cool, know now."" say where. comment seemed imply Covid entails prolonged immune compromised. believe case. Maldives? fewer cases NYS!!! would safer go vs staying here!!! Lol... end June Europe vaccinated, around time UK catch second dose rest population vaccinated. meantime Europe still exporting vaccine others countries deep need eg UK. banned flights India coming USA? Alright well stay inside next decade, I’m way bar Serriously? sisters kids live Iin Scappoose virtual classes seemed awful me. I'm opening schools next school year think virtual classes great.

I'll say sisters kids 5 7 may made harder. absolute hell sister get kids schoolwork home.  appreciate explanation much shoulder muscle cells signaling shoulder sore first shot. wish explanation could rendered short animation film help others understand mechanism too. can’t explain better. Mother giving HPV prime candidate it

20 years old im getting summer. Better late never  There’s huge difference working home masking wear mask day work. wear mask 15 minutes grocery store, really wouldn’t care either totally understand point view. 

However, wear mask day coaching job running around, trying talk people hear me, sweating, gets pretty unpleasant hours especially it’s hot. still agree masking places makes sense (not outside) stay little longer, really excited day don’t need wear mask anymore work. situation could rapidly change full FDA approval including children new variants/surges.   Neither Israel, yet far better.  really get point is. actual arguments ""no u r wrong""? makes disagree estimates linked?  It’s frustrating people downplay risk Whoa... I'm disagreeing vaccines. trying add conversation, US probably send vaccines Africa Total Doses Distributed
290,685,655
Total Doses Administered
225,640,460

I think states could start sharing some.  mandate, think become cultural norm put mask think might sick public. part responsible member society risking infecting others. Feeling little one day sure getting sick yet? Put mask day two.  people extremely vulnerable every virus including flu. compromised protect yourself, can't expect others to. feel bad extremely small number going shift policy country. many doses American get consider allowing exports raw materials countries give citizens first dose? (Genuine question) Oh God's sakes.... It’s also one mined countries due Soviets dropping loads around country. USA far behind embarrassing example long, elderly hospitals due Covid everything back normal?? cheering virus. one buying drink trying introduce friends family like one. 

Masks safe effective way slow transmission respiratory virus.  people unable compare contrast green apples red apples object others using term “both sides”.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* cases continuing pace that's frankly surprising given significant chunk vaccinated.

We still hit critical moment yet. Looking data Israel. started seeing SHARP decline cases around March 12. 

This 55% population vaccinated least 1 dose 44% fully vaccinated.

America almost there, we'll see.. South American giant recorded 67,977 deaths far April, making deadliest month yet ends, topping March's 66,573 fatalities, Health Ministry past 24 hours, Brazil recorded 3,076 deaths, seven-day average 2,545 deaths per day.

The fact they've became origin new variant due Bolsonaro lack common sense, really dangerous whole continent. So, now? Assuming live US.

We talking US. appointments available willing drive bit mean everyone wants get vaccinated tomorrow. still ~2 million new first doses much want bet still masks restrictions then?

Six weeks now? way.

Will urban hospitals still threat collapse fully reopening 40% population unvaccinated baseline reproductive rate 4? Probably June, maybe fall could thing.

Will care means everyone 16, eligible vaccination, choice catch COVID? Again, probably not.  We'll know soon. Novavax J &amp;J waiting wings, realistically they'll delivered first week July. say recently Novavax CEO used purposefully obtuse phrase ""by Summer"". know it'll approved delivered. 

So AZ recommendations change goalposts probably move. July august 2024 Keep mind 70% Israel’s population 18+, versus US 76%. Yeah, Covid come realization wrongly conflated vaccination IV insertion blood draws, made feel ready get it. Let give point view.

The flu whooping cough still exist. times killed hundreds thousands plagues own, don’t. haven’t entirely “beaten,” we’d need worth it.

The happen Covid. get relatively low, never zero, levels mortality. resume life normal life like this, forever, worth living mentally sound person responds normally kind thing.

I feel like misunderstand I’m trying say. I’m saying eradication impossible, doesn’t mean never return full-on normal. could allergic reaction, possibly psychosomatic. Regardless, would best interest inform whoever gives next vaccine symptoms experienced. Assuming mean people refuse get it. assume ignorance. mean belittle people, ignorance simply means understand vaccine created works. know ""it's trial vaccine created quickly long term testing"". want ""risk"" it.

I fence, friend gave information received oncologist. reassured nothing worry about, got Pfizer shot yesterday.  market oxygen really tricky right now. despise Modi, autocratic religious populist, know blame that. That's good point regarding prevalence.

The reason asking question seems like gospel lot people ""even vaccinated still transmit covid"" true every vaccine, reduces odds dramatically essentially mean vaccines end game pandemic. protesters said want ""do good doctoring"" would appear disagree point, since they're walking around without masks heckling others compliance law (and common decency). US population 350 million 40% first dose. long way position comfortably export. Besides US consuming taxpayer paid anyone else feel entitled vaccines ? I'm sorry family going this. wish words, know nothing ease right now. wish family best luck hope sun shines clouds soon you. Indian politics complex pluses minuses “both sides”. Hate term. 

The key India avoid deadly pandemics accelerate sustained economic growth. regard, track record sides look data. country’s potential different complex reasons. infection screw vaccination. CDC recommends delaying symptoms cleared confused vaccine side effects. Meh, may better getting one shitty reaction instead two. AZ ship vaccine drug substance Maryland plant Europe make shortfall production there. sure still little drug substance coming EU, AstraZeneca turned U.S. plant Maryland make ""The important quantity"" drug substance came American plant, owned Catalent, put vials Italy process known ""fill finish,"" documents said, detailing inspections January early February three AstraZeneca plants Belgium, Italy Netherlands produced vaccines variant India (B1617) far away British Columbia. I'm sure identified Washington Oregon, hope not. way, efficacy probability infection also different things. Oh wow doubling ignorant assumptions, giving best insults 5th grade offer. worth considering mortality rate AZ side effect dropping becoming better understood treatment protocols developed. Hopefully counter need restrict use 30s. think 8m potential people Pfizer 16m total doses left delivered everyone single dose far gets second. Moderna delivers time would mean sufficient mRNA vaccines 18-30 year olds June 31st enough AZ used 30-40 age group since enough mRNA 18-40 year olds.

&amp;#x200B;

Remains seen whether advice changes yes, could get pretty difficult hit target CDC recommend quarantining fully vaccinated symptoms. don’t think realize much bubble live believe (not travel tourism) Isn’t immune system for? ""world"" laughing America 2020, want vaccines IP free ? sheer sense entitlement! all. 1.79% positivity today 200k tests. It’s depressing Indiana. got good start consistently falling behind past 2 months. Yes ever wish reach heard immunity need stop spread hospitalizations deaths. That's 85% important. need vaccinate even higher percentage UK figures accurate opposed 95% previously published. health insurance emailed last week say offering home testing. sounds expensive. Though someone say crazy $200 roundtrip tickets day, brief minutes. people can't afford work Covid cases rise may there’s good chance AZ recommended ages risk dying covid goes higher blood clots vaccine, also may get JnJ July global pandemic. one reason travel. lot talk rate decline made think Israel. According Bloomberg's vaccine tracker 7-day average January 26 193K doses. Today's 7-day average 10.4K. That's massive decline.

They're 57.4% fully vaccinated means still way go get beyond 70%. [This article found addressed slowdown others great success vaccination program been. know deaths &amp; new cases cratered. Hopefully lasts. Interestingly, exact thing happened year first time life got vaccine. tested negative covid time I'm wondering related previous covid infection. Vaccine could causing immune response. stupid pandemic actually over, IMO, whenever everyone wants get vaccinated get vaccinated.

So, now? Assuming live US.

Or rather, two weeks now, give immunity time get in.

Or, fine, want REALLY overly cautious wait maximum effect vaccines, six weeks now.

How much want bet still masks restrictions then? ysoseriouslymad, ironic. fit? Probably not. sounds really nice. common practice mass sites, wish would advertised more. picturing possibly fainting holding vaccination line causing vaccines expire staff tried figure wtf wrong me. Speak old man. Actually vaccines risk infection.  influenza vaccine low efficacy rate \~ 44%. Chickenpox vaccine 92%. Measles 97%. However, big factor virus PREVALENCE. Chickenpox measles low prevalence risk LOW. Covid still high prevalence risk infection. covid gets Israel type numbers, risk LOW. Covid rare measles chickenpox, low probability infection. Straining healthcare system accelerate deaths, straining testing system also leads longer return time tests. outbreaks deaths cases get reported nearly simultaneously like [Czechia also lag month, common US since testing optimized last summer.

A couple weeks ago, India's testing strained. surely must approaching test capacity now. throw samples can't test, backlog them? Something remember State State reasoning behind this. Vaccinating teachers would push 80+ 2-3 weeks out, yes. vaccinating 80+ first would mean teachers wouldn’t vaccinated May. Obviously, timeline different considering we’re 100% eligible April, think logic point fair. also able get 85 year old family member signed shot Feb 18th. got first shot week got first.

 I’m biased; I’m teacher Oregon signed shot day said eligible. also notice state rates climbing- seemed start 3 weeks schools started opening mid February. that, incredibly thankful able vaccinated getting back classroom. I’m sure best route forward current stage. Distance learning struggle, we’ve back 2 weeks I’m finally seeing students never showed Zoom, never signed Canvas. Even kids started year trying well lost motivation parents tired fighting school- they’re starting try they’re back classroom. 

But rates climbing. think couple students go home quarantine due close contact already. parent would think long hard sending kid room 15 unvaccinated people even shortened day. lot students whose chance graduating high school diminishing every missed class; it’s scary balance. Heckling bad, whether heckle someone without mask. ""fit"" anywhere ""any that"". I'm sure part ""using medications"" ""properly funding hospitals"" ""that"". submission linking linktr.ee automatically removed source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* you’re vaccinated, you’re already It’s pilgrimage season- period hundreds millions head Ganges cleanse sins

It’s political rallies Looking post history, since high risk, would continue avoid big box stores store really fully vaccinated, even then, continue wear tight fitted mask inside businesses kind. There's difference health care systems medical manufacturing capacity. Canada vaccine production facilities, right kind ones. solution guarantee supply would subsidize construction capacity funds allocated year ago. far tell, happen. argument terrible, yes, quite fitting. J&amp;J makes zillion times easier run different vaccination campaigns also. Right now, butting anti-vaxxers. We're butting apathetic people can't bothered deal two separate appointments want deal wonky Walgreens site Kinda, yeah. tell people get vaccine acts like benefit. vaccines aren’t gonna let us go back normal what’s point? J&amp;J like 5% supply Nah, bang pots pans give good luck. I'm saying places safe. There's many idiots refuse wear masks properly all. air filtered circulated enough properly filter airborne virus. best bet get vaccinated. load 💩. “Approval Q1 2022,” even delays vaccination current vaccines, arrive late. heckling others wearing mask fit that? see saying. Covid deaths typically lag infections...unless hospitals overwhelmed. deaths come quickly, treatment. Younger boomers fought Vietnam astounded went vacation 2000. 30ish years later. - Canada way, way smaller absolutely vaccine production facilities - people expecting us vaccinating amount people US grasp reality.

We’ve days hit 360/370,000 vaccines per day - which, per capita compared US quite close.

A lot people make sound like vaccineless hellscape. province, they’re expecting 75% adults first shot early June, sooner. responsibility pandemic doesn’t end reach herd immunity Yeah, hope spread like high population Asian countries. vulnerable funny mention ""anti-science misinformation"" read science literature, pretty much shows vaccines reduce risk serious illness risk transmitting it. Essentially, vaccinations end pandemic. Reddit reduced hypothetical fear-mongering (""What vaccines work hypothetical new variant?"" like),

If want stay inside god knows long, should. I'm not. wife immunocompromised dad serious heart surgery last fall. three us fully vaccinated three us going eat tonight, indoors. come family doctors (my aunt practice, cousin UCLA medical school) thing. “If fit would side”

Lmao wow child. naive 2D perspective. wonder thought initial comment even worth spewing It’s already terrible it’s likely going get even worse week two. 7 day average covid deaths new cases hit new high yesterday. Since deaths lagging indicator means haven’t yet seen impact last days increases unfortunately speed vaccinations likely won’t able stop spread unless picks lot soon. probably seem abundant half population refusing get vaccine. knew coming. always works way. follows Brazil’s path (peak 3K 200M population) reach 18-20k per day. system India however seems collapsing much earlier wave Brazil get even worse. “No u” answer? Fitting. Nobody salty US getting vaccines first large amounts. illusion largest economy world first line. entire premise wrong. thing think scale short time operating system update billions devices. Except humans getting software patch fight virus (no 5G pun intended). That's efficacy works. ~95% reduction. 5,814 vaccinated people contract disease population 75 million, expect something like 110,000 infections similarly sized population vaccinated. also birthplace carrots radish. depends look. people still encountering issues finding appointment. hear starting reallocate doses based demand, doesnt seem enough certain places Exported vaccines save lives country exported to, cost lives country they’re exported from. It’s weird you’re pissed deaths caused exporting Considering don’t live cold climate - yeah would really upsetting make me
Cover nose mouth wishes. 

I’m debate masks - I’m “it’s piece cloth” gaslighting repulsive.

Whether pro masks indefinite masking, pretending like anyone dislikes wearing unreasonable wrong. nonsensical. Okay... much dislike current government divisive politics, toppling government going help us moment. 

But vein, I’d like point Indians never advocated Americans die pandemic country would wake “learn hard way” bring political change required. never thought refusing medicines vaccines requested (especially position help). said world US. flu epidemic 1918 killed mostly young adults. Could case next time. Serious question: group risk received J&amp;J known cause blood clots, offer kind preventative treatment even risk low? taking aspirin? get risk low still risk known could taken another vaccine. feels like CDC response ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ plus, people forget significant # americans didnt even realize pause going tired overused comeback answer anyone think we're woods yet. We're family three small business. incredibly active pandemic, plan ""herd immunity"" kicks eventually, ever insanely high amount anti-science misinformation surged popularity last 4 years. Kiss mentality; people things love care want protect, themselves, first airborne endemic blood disease society face. Well, work grocery store. leaning helping old lady credit card machine one day, coughed right mouth, sick cold 24 hrs later... I'm usually 3 feet away people I'm ringing up. Snotty nosed kids literally inches face....this whole thing opened eyes lot much exposure general public. hope wear mask job too. I’ve saying pretty much thing, definitely stings see actually happening. Yeh remember reading stories wuhan stuff subreddits looked early data said spreads internationally become pandemic. Noone told really cared. ""it's flu, bro!""

I think one worst things ever call ""COVID"". called SARS2. Covid sound scary allowed ridiculous flu comparison. 
The shit thing issue absolutely shithouse advice everything- ""closed borders = racist"" ""There's h2h human transmission! risk! Never worry! China honest! 😊"". hate trump passion right call WHO. I’m vaccine expert - I’m stating Bancel told press earlier week. Yeah US.. got first shot moderna last Thursday, caught COVID two days later, Saturday. I’m pretty much worst caught soon vaccine definitely develop antibodies first shot— question is, get second shot I’m scheduled catching virus first second shot screw up? mean they’ve asked US raw materials vaccines got denied  fun superspreader event then! wondering kids ages 6 months + piggy question, came ask thing, younger kids. would like know studies showing promise young children? reduce chances getting 95% transmitting That's how. 346,786. wondering. Almost one Australia got Covid moment. rather vaccines couple months earlier 100K+ deaths like horribly badly run UK? fair honest, elected tea maker Prime Minister. joker opposition leader though.... Currently student teaching past Friday noticed dramatic increase students missing. one class missing five students. Haven’t told whether it’s COVID, imagine  no? like $8,000 stimmy anyone valid vaccine passport thinking ""I know shipping doses alone caused hamper international supply chains think silicon issue pressing matter"" clicked. Well done. simply explaining reasoning people preferred J&amp;J, think one taking things context.... idea FDA CDC going approve vaccine kids 12-15??? quickly running demand states, better way keep demand allowing younger kids get vaccinated chose? Obviously anecdotal someone went vaxx site, 5 mins check observation area times. record, Seattle *huge* uptake  think case, close number 1st doses admin plus fully vaccinated divided 2, slightly lower. interpreting comment confrontational? It’s either stating experience. people know preferred mRNA vaccines. doesn’t mean everyone even people do.  Good, global cases actually 14%. we've got ways go. Delhi, Mumbai, Pune bigger cities similar issues currently. Smaller cities started seeing spread cases now, things still manageable point. Obviously things smaller cities managed way they've larger cities, everyone's fucked. D&amp;D group talking going back person games us fully vaccinated, thought hanging unmasked crowed, poorly ventilated basement seems crazy even though logically perfectly safe. hard shake mindset we've last year, especially since there's still restrictions place aspects lives. think get everyone vaccinated, cases drop average flu season levels, restrictions end, lot easier drop mindset completely. already one.. continue? Well that’s also reported number. Excess death statistics suggest it’s little bit higher reported.   Jamaican here. would never imagined taking personal bias vice president's global aid ideals policies, ridiculous!  experts say beginning sars2? wild ride America already sent doses “loan” Canada more. Canada ordered paid AstraZeneca vaccines *manufactured* US. Whether Canada gets existing vials “belong” US gets Canada-specific vials, argument unnecessary academic exercise. sorely needed now. charged murders? insane. America paid unemployment everyone lost work due lockdowns. That’s going happen India. Totally different situations. headline says 1B doses administered globally post directly says US administered 225M doses. That's honestly sick. help problem go away. think means current amount vaccines stored country enough cover certain percent population. probably though.  Slap face. stupid think problem variants resistant current vaccine waning immunity.

Nuff said dont spend time Pennsylvania went apeshit last election, mainly spend time CoronavirusPA, nice little community track every stat daily updates come. community pretty positive. Depends ‘we.’ convinced vsafe US CDC best dataset available, haven’t seen metrics, raw summarized, anywhere.  Disposed masks cause damages environment. Also country 1/6-1/5 total deaths world. EU contract says get vaccine first that's fine. 

To that's vaccine nationalism good principle - putting ""legal contracts"" change that. Given recent experiences, may well EU feels like must sign ""me-first"" contracts protect started it. That's hypocritical. still wish wouldn't, likes US UK around, maybe there's choice atm.

You may also consider nobody else Switzerland signed contract Curevac supply chain yet (afaik) - else *should* getting doses anyway? may also want base EU bashing speculation random redditor.

Yep, absolutely correct. CCP become super serious something, something must either super good super bad. What? didn't? Personally wanted one-dose vaccine, I'd take Pfizer Moderna refuse second appointment. Less risk J&amp;J, probably better efficacy (about 92% 2 weeks first dose second dose). Yes, that's right. Makes wonder goes minds Indian netizens went hospital upper respiratory tract infection couple years ago adult, RSV referring to? GASPING air.

Yes one geographical locations stopped living 16th century. not. material exactly? anyone else make it?

 us spent great deal money used every resource get companies manufacture needed. one point reliant China simple masks. regular people sewing. spent whole year preparing overcome pandemic. still working need material vaccinate every American. material sitting unused. 

The problem J J plant illustrates can't count supply delivered. Homicidal tribalism peculiar Afghanistan J&amp;J coming December :( ban started Trump era

So? still blame USA this. Trump elected American people. upfront open bad policy make bad part better. I'm also defending Indian government mistakes. However US alone responsible allows exported always option going 200 countries, dependent USA though?

Because US one places world massive vaccine production, one many people already protected. expect EU China exporters America vaxxed USA seen 500K deaths twice number cases full right support people.

Yes deaths hospitalisations dropped quite time ago - that's latest point exports started. underestimate Placebo effect. people control arm clinical studies getting adverse reaction saline. That's mRNA vaccines work. Why? like homemade fabric mask, hard predict effective interventions be.  downplay covid, surprising. Death rate early 20th century much higher now. comparing excess deaths percentage comparing apples apples. export bans exporting precursor material vaccines. she'd actually worked get people vaccinated instead putting endless lockdown *Cries Canadian* headline wanted see last march  Homeboy...let’s see citations data you’re reporting authorities. That’s convince others. sadly also given kind people, trying focus talking non-radicalized people. People fence get vaccine not. usually talked to, various different people expose real fact, might save falling anti-science, anti-vax camp. Anti-vaxxers fucking us. Sure.

I'm looking travel summer (yes, I'm vaccinated) I'm baffled almost nowhere vaccine mean anything. places still require covid-19 tests 3 days outright quarantines. Costa Rica lets bypass checks long pay insurance. Mexico requirements entry all. saw Guatemala eastern European countries catching though letting vaccinated issues.

And still need negative rapid PCR covid test return. Vaccine not. also Jamaican heritage never seen someone Jamaica asking help. relates Afghanistan how? Say India accused ""anti-national"" Everyone wants one get moment vaccine sites half empty country. people certainly want them, many have.

My solution give away astrazeneca, dont need all. still waiting fda approval plenty companies. Welcome Reddit 😂 Wait hear happened Europe 1914 1945 Yeah, getting trouble something malicious wrong ‘cancel culture’. gets thrown around lot days. Criticizing banning material export ok encouraged Indians see way. particularly harsh VP Kamala Harris India even though ""daughter India"" due mixed racial heritage. haven’t even vaccinated half people yet U.S. 

We need them. outbid rest world them.

Once get Israel level vaccinations, lend vaccines countries. Can't wait vaccine gets approved 16. Kids dirty need prevent spreading vulnerable people. common efficacy drops. Normal. Holy fuck hope one day come stupor realize brainwashed are. really hope so. feel bad people like talk like that. Like whatever into, way deep want okay Well actually government responsibility citizens elected (although fact seem think otherwise also telling). country important US global responsibility, too. US already stable time now, exporting doses overdue Biden administration used Defense Production Act increase production order aggressively tackle COVID domestically exactly could export them

Yes, shame. small amount doses could've exported early without hurting vaccine rollout, volumes increasing time soon at-risk groups done. healthy 16 year old American needs jab less urgently elderly person nurses countries like Brazil. people need vaccine happen eventually

Nice, late. really needed. Perhaps worth questioning survey well. statements made Manaus, Brazil herd immunity levels sero survey short time later either proved survey wrong something else happened. simpler explanation survey gamed answer wanted. Measles eradicated, actually. exists small amounts, much still around. human disease ever truly eradicated smallpox. I’ll get there. went indoor event tonight masks it’s bunch people know. matter? Science evolves, changes adapts information gathered. wore mask anyway, literally downsides pandemic. trust make decisions? misunderstood took snear flex. Tone hard read Internet. 

The core difference vaccine vaccine access. US heavy industry shear dollars produce vaccines within borders. Canada not. reason Canada vaccine production previously nationalized vaccine development program gutted current government, privatizated sold off, Canada scientists equipment produce vaccines within borders. really anything Canadian healthcare generally speaking think healthcare heavy industry develop novel vaccines rather patient point contact...which Canada par everyone else at. Aside glut AZ due medical review, Canadian provinces pretty much line states far using delivered vaccines patients, good good overall oar. 

So domestic production, Canada needs import current troubles start. likelihood Trump admin going block things (this happened PPE last year US government stopped shipment PPE bound Canada mid transit confiscated it), Canadian strategy procurement fully rely one manufacturer country....and meant lots orders different parts world mainly Europe, Canada went wide basically ordered enough vaccines something like 8 10 doses per person. remember exact breakdown Canada heavy novavax J&amp;J COVAX plenty orders viable vaccine candidates. differed Israeli strategy (keep mind Israel 10m people compared 35m Canada) Israel paid something like triple price Pfizer. hindsight worked mRNA new tech issues Israel would creek without paddle. ballsy gamble. Canadian sourcing mostly Europe India due US defacto export bans AZ go due UK priority, moderna Pfizer early production struggles mean several early deliveries slipped put Canada behind proverbial 8 ball. Pfizer Moderna early Europe component sourcing issues (a side effect US Defense Production Act give US plants massive buying power) delayed bit consequently explains European Canadian struggle. 


I know sheds light better. Love hate Trudeau strategy go wide necessarily deep varying timelines whereas countries went narrow deep and/or domestic production capacity rely on. Actually opposite me. people know wanted take one shot done it. Good go 2 weeks vs 6. vaccinated. I’m hard time understanding issues people continued masking requirements since literally don’t know anyone wants drop masks anytime soon. can’t help wonder anger continued masking see reports press vocal minority social circular anomaly. fear it’s another extension stupid, po

You know ANYONE wants stop masking anytime soon? must get much. still almost week left month. everything address overpopulation abject poverty It’s crazy, totally ballooned top pandemic. Then, lost lowest weight adult life. Crazy happened year! COVID least partially blame them. 14* vaccine barely introduced, we're still gathering data state currently [fastest increases cases think better question would is: people ignoring [advice CDC fully vaccinated institution gathers data for, literally dictates disease management policy country? specifically India compared Brazil, Mexico Canada?  Ok parents US - going change you’re vaccinated? 

We took toddler preschool he’s staying home husband, really plays cousins outdoors. talked husband letting take neighbor’s outdoor play date, pretty quickly started revealing she’s super anti vax doesn’t really take Covid precautions. Ack!

It probably spooked us bit, first trip bubble. I’m afraid nothing going loosen us kids vaccinated.

Have given kids bigger range since vaccinated? add one number tomorrow! Guessing down-voted me.. joke anti-mask comment.. Disposable masks develop mold while, meant re-used.. know research personal experience combined.. o.O; Good know. Thanks update.  numbers game, me. higher community spread is, higher likelihood run it. breakthrough cases rare, mean wife can't small percentage. importantly, I've said many times guess say again: *my child cannot get vaccine long time*. Yes, children categorically easier time it, there's way know *your* child react entirely new disease. barely scratched surface studying even exist last year, I'd rather simply assume child fine there's [a chance might is, I've done fine past year measures. Another month two going kill give vaccine chance reduce community transmission. vaccine truly effective initial data suggests *(and watching Israel, although follow measures better US does)*, numbers reflect that. make decisions *think* happen, instead happening right eyes right now?

In meantime, we're still past year; first trip see family, also fully vaccinated, we're still taking many measures; indoor eating, hanging indoors extended time, wearing masks indoors do. We'll getting take hanging beach parks friends, still maintaining distance anybody know anybody fully vaccinated. alignment CDC advises, me, seems smart play safe bit longer know sure we're moving right direction.  There's tougher supply side issue exist anyone walk block pharmacy get one time, day, though. 

If get day off, kids knew take care of, I'd concerned trying organize specifically could get shot (second, specifically). well good work home plenty sick days, tough schedule time know might get sick. 6'2"" 35year old started pandemic 265lb. I'm 220 dont get winded easily. Realized desk office snacking hard frequently visiting breakroom vending machines. Even issue - didn’t know many people wanted J&amp;J unless bothered go back second dose. people know openly stated preferred Moderna Pfizer efficacy differences. know maybe 2 ppl j&amp;j vs 50 primarily Pfizer. don’t think it’s reintroduction affect overall number much. I’m glad hear this. Sounds bit similar US last year (some governors battling forward despite bad leadership). I’ve Brazil love country really pulling get side too. Let's hope be, countries vaccinate rate Still can't get age group yet, looking forward 🙂  make sure refer doctor “step-brother” Never mind decades government research.... quite 'abundance' available walk-in easy make appointment.

God bless one dose huge benefit many levels. Lots still want it. They’re done 2 weeks later - it’s compelling minuscule risk mainly one demographic.  trust CDC said masks didn’t help beginning? Might regret exporting bunch raw materials turns need manufacture boosters. experience, preferred talking point ""it kills people.""

Apparently, dying covid fine, though? Like literally every vaccine, yes.

Recipients organ transplants take immunosuppressive drugs order stop immune systems rejecting donor organs. unfortunate side effect making vaccines either much less effective effective all, anything new.  Everything potentially lethal ffs...

Well I’m happy contributed. Dose 2 Pfizer pumping veins speak. misunderstanding effectiveness vaccines? missing here? Breakthrough infections occurring rates .03–.5%. numbers go going speak, millions vaccinated. type transmission fully vaccinated person worry about, exactly? Genuinely curious, keep hearing sentiment fully vaccinated people (definitely ready eat inside restaurant yet), don’t understand thought process. 

Yes, anti-maskers, COVID denialists, anti-vaxxers. Yes, community spread among unvaccinated partially vaccinated. people fully vaccinated people? Clorox Bleach injections? Let's downplay treatment. year worked wonders! makes sense federal mandates, nothing state mandates.  No

No. Pfizer tried even larger dose try single dose found two smaller doses produced better immune response single larger dose. (Can’t find study right now)

They headache fever Tylenol took care of. "" Partial vaccination 77% (95%CI: 71 — 82) effective preventing hospitalization 64.2% (95%CI: 13.0 — 85.2) effective preventing death.

ETA here's link want compare healthcare systems take look CFR. Regardless irrespective... sorry help it! No, different. nations could it, would. can't. Nope. vaccinate everyone it'll eradicate like measles eradicate on. There's 300 million change people America, that's lot people. Many elderly fragile health point time.

US healthcare really good need something cutting edge. brilliant specialists medical specialities. people points life need something high tech, need primary secondary care things like diabetes, hypertension, common ailments. that's something generally need super skilled specialists for. need qualified doctor access and, metric, American health care much worse. willful ignorance. vaccine 100 percent efficient. covid vaccines efficient most, make single person 90 percent less likely contract covid unvaccinated person. always chance get sick vaccination, would 90 percent less likely to.

This effect compounds people get vaccinated. long people refuse vaccinate, always reservoir infection, causing increased need masks, lockdowns, recurrent vaccination... see I'm going this?

You need educate mRNA vaccines, need educate vaccines public health **period.** what? BioNTech developed without Pfizer, company grown global pharmaceutical superpower American policies favor promote type growth.

No matter mad makes Europeans, Canadians, Australians, whatever, that's truth. really don’t best healthcare. great insurance and/or lot money average individuals avoid medical care unless dying due debt incur, it’s really good. best deduction many people waited little late get medical care cases due costs IMO unacceptable changes made due this.

Pretty garbage actually US (rightly) threw ton money pharma speed development vaccines locked generous contracts buy doses. others pointed out, reflective differences healthcare systems, rather one economics. 50th birthday march... sucked.

I've lost grandmother it, can't imagine feel become orphans within days. US still hasn’t understood it’s interest help get rest world vaccinated. self interest ethical duty aligned still ... Good. decided wait anymore. First day back gym today. county nearly 50% vaccinated first dose 35% fully. Cases trending down, too. Delhi problem electricity supply. rest country yes delhi say India though? wish Danish authorities would send stock AZ B&amp;H. going use anyway don’t think it’s entirely political. think it’s risk serious case death people 65 comorbidities sufficiently low people would prefer natural immunity. Vaccines won’t solve problem India facing imo. way cases rising, need medical supplies anything. Glad hear it, hopefully little late. Dunno got downvoted, you’re right people pissed there? We've thing year hardly come nowhere government try prevent this? call BS, Chaddi.

Looking vaccination plan pretty safe go next year fact, EU vaccinating average US today. :)

Interestingly though, 6 New England states occupy top 8 states first doses among total population. Rhode Island 50% total population, sitting behind New Mexico Hawaii. depends conditions. mosh pit outside, I'd wear mask. sitting picknick blanket family, spot reasonable distance away, no. We've learned data past year something 5% positivity indicates severe undertesting.

I even know 50% means. correct. However, India exported tens millions vaccines produced India. article mentioned agreed send raw vaccine materials official us govt source. . fact makes point mentioning 

 Earlier Sunday, US National Security Advisor Secretary State tweeted expressing solidarity extending assistance specified whether New Delhi’s specific demand related vaccine raw material would fulfilled not. think would problem distancing like China asian countries? lol...  year Idealism good starting point long understand practical constraints reality change depending situation. open borders normal times absolutely good thing, however deadly global pandemic, take care people. xenophobic close travel regions taking pandemic seriously giant, mask, distancing superspreader events despite #1 world new cases. Pretending want take imagined moral high ground absolutely moronic.

Even every person world fully vaccinated (which we're even remotely close to), would _still_ terrible idea allow unrestricted travel regions virus running rampant, variants emerged _so far_ overwhelmingly resistant current vaccines, country that's 50% test positivity rate basically giant petri dish. Every single transmission low chance vaccine-resistant mutation, many new infections per day, overall chance rises significantly.

Calling basic preventative measures xenophobic insulting people currently trying save lives best can, insulting people actually work enact positive social change. want stop xenophobia, get high horse work make positive changes see particular danger flight full people particular country high case rate

Then understanding virus spreads. flight full infected people could spread virus every person come contact with. people would unknowingly spread people _they_ come contact with, on.

Vaccine data delayed *at least* days. numbers go [the vaccine type graph CDC's tracking old data that's making way CDC slowly. updates numbers far back 4 weeks, I've observed. 

We see real impact data later week. J&amp;J back circulation yesterday. always US, UK Canada come save everyone else? serious? 80% sounds bit low, whats espectation vaccine uptake end US? 

We far guys uptake offerede (65+) vaccine around 90% majority uneducated misguided government incompetent f*k working biggest logistical problem last 50 years literally every governmenr clamboring product every employee unimaginable pressure deliver cutting edge life saving medicines scales companies never operated supply chain likely covering multiple continents? hard. always going hiccups long period vaccine demand far outstripped supply.

Notes:

* raw data downloaded exact totals every age group downloaded [CDC vaccination demographic trends CSV. CDC indicates data ""Date Administered"", actually appears ""Date Reported"".
* Texas (about 9% US population) excluded CDC demographic data, tables match national totals.
* CDC reports vaccinations 0-17 age group. 16-17 age group calculated using 2019 Census estimates 11.4% aged 0 17 ages 16 17, assuming 0-17 age group doses given ages 16 17. New variants rise minute rate India getting new cases. like boosters thin air, stem flow. xenophobia ... windows open cause nice out? polling showing somewhere 60% 70% adult population willing take vaccine, would put us 160m 185m people. Thats 20m 45m first doses left.

Hopefully, add 12-15 year olds numbers end May. would put another \~15M people (or \~5% population) mix inch us closer herd immunity.

In fact, based [the CDC's assuming decay old cases, we're actually right around 2/3 country (66.6%, fact) sort antibody level system. We're getting *very* close herd immunity threshold.

For worried vaccine hesitant, looks like need end pandemic US. course, still go get many folks vaccinated possible, looking like they're going screw everything us, thankfully.  Love to, automod. Talked fam Hyderabad morning unbothered. bourgeois middle class driving kamikaze flight. question, what's efficacy rate Chinese SinoVac vaccine? Almost does, Netherlands deaths 99.2% 50+   think even though Indian little wiser educated you.

Cue frantic googling disprove 

Let save time, try Washington post Unless 16 Ireland something strange planned, I’d say chance large earlier. Netherlands start giving shots 55-60 groups couple weeks seems like take five years per week, end June 18+. soon US decides longer needs AZ hit herd immunity. That’s probably month away. estimate % US population 12-15 years old? Pfizer approved, see school districts mandating vaccination students entering high school. High uptake group could get us total population herd immunity, no? Yeah

As fast vaccination going signs breaking transmission we're already seeing expect things basically back 2019 July Regionally 100% achievable. kids get vaccines US northeast reach little need persuade people. Thanks. Saves LOT work :). country protected, protect others protect themselves. get this. Around 50% sdult population vaccinated seems golden number. Cases dropped cliff around point Israel UK. Ok, thing want bring repeating pattern point: Northern States get fucked March/April, Southern states pick slack late May/June. Texas hasn’t meaningfully reduced caseload since March, there’s lots embers around blow cases quickly like saw Michigan. posts largely vaccine skepticism denial? reported way? http://londonmandir.baps.org/support-us/

Obviously top one: BAPS India Covid Emergency Appeal yeah, super-powerful nations like Hungary Serbia, 30% population vaccinated.

Those nations using Chinese vaccines. words, foreign vaccines. offer one step ""conspiracy theory""? (for science, course):

Here [Dr. Pierre Kory coming conclusion two months ago. thought world gone insane. think see quite rational (and evil).

Timestamps [the 1hr 11min long:

* [WHO budget comes strings [No news media picked - engineered misinformation [To end? maintain vac [Everyone first two shots; variants; need boosters! endless market [The documentary ""what - mentions ""independent WHO""
* [Callout physicians world: got . . . Natural immunity plays factor mask debacle lied effectiveness necessity cover stockpile shortage... nothing w evidence, fact helped contribute politicizing masks difficulty encouraging adoption. That’s higher rate blood clots J&amp;J vaccine. It’s interesting different two treated. places open down. Bars restaurants west village packed. Madison Square Garden open (I believe require sort proof vaccination negative test) makes months next week gonna big batch.  Unfortunately US, making comparison Israel vaccinated many adults may bought luxury 15 under.  might lucky adult uptake stalls out. Thanks taking time go back look report again. often people skim, find argument want make, disappear. actually care understanding though, given hope depressing day me. 

Over (Washington state) we're seeing increases like earlier version what's going Michigan many people side want see excuse away. schools also restrictions campus fall Ireland starting 60-64 hopfully I'll get mine July/August. anyone problem Coca-Cola flavour recovering covid? disgusting me, like cheap ass cokes local grocery stores one ever said fatality rate 10%. always range 1-3%, consistently, across sources information. model referencing (Imperial College) showing could happen nothing. I'm amazed, paying attention last year? key issue death rate covid, prospect health care system overwhelmed cases new virus know deal time (see: Italy). 

We vaccines, medicines, therapeutics, clearer understanding disease. last Spring. shut keep system intact. country open (with regional exceptions) since last May. It’s extremely positive EU soon 5th vaccine, seems like initially produced small quantities it’s possibly game changer looked like would couple months ago. See BBC local news report Delhi, ambulances waiting outside, people dying back ambulances, people stretchers gasping air, insanely heartbreaking. hope get India discovered best way get US give stuff - make US helping look like win communism lmao coronaviruses vaccines induce immunity stronger immunity induced natural infectioin. Herd immunity achievable US northeast likely reach it, quickly.

The US South likely never reach rate, yeah sporadic outbreaks probable. Maybe that's grammar error put it. I'll edit ""a months"" ""months"". effect health system occur 2 weeks date testing

You totally pro masking still understand burdensome many people variety reasons. hate wearing them. hot Uncomfortable - stifling. miss seeing faces, miss smiling kissing baby are, example; waiting line. data deaths coming India pure BS. deaths show much, lag. cases went up, deaths well.

Get bus. Wear mask passenger's comfort &amp; make easy workers. But..ride bus. got shots &amp; safe. Enjoy life again! Well, know answer, piss match country reddit love shit on.

And Indian politician psychopathic enough sacrifice citizen geopolitical brownie points.  Lockdown-to-elimination works prevent virus entering borders again, otherwise keep enacting harsh lockdowns every time new case pops up.

Europe USA never going able eliminate virus permanently. many reasons why, one particular illegal immigration aggressively prevented, actively tolerated large segments society. Unless approach illegal immigration completely changed, ways would shock world’s conscience, border states would constantly total lockdown, would tolerated long. Sir please internal matter, outside forces allowed interfere this. I'm sure government quickly solve situation. #IndiaTogether

Commenters even said ant-vaccine. I’m sorry triggered women speaking health concerns. Don’t worry, women used everything say misconstrued, misrepresented ignored. seems you’ve done thread listened all, knee-jerked opposition. women pretty damned tired attempts shut us up, please, go bother real anti-vaxx assholes. Apparently vaccinating said vulnerable people instead children? Czechia suppressed spring summer wave, infection exploded September death toll spiked 3 weeks later. pointed late 3 day holiday September village wine festivities, pilgrimage celebrate St Wenceslaus feast, farmer markets (equivalent Munich Oktoberfest) Prague, film festivals, school openings. Suddenly got tens thousands people intermingling short time cocktail Czech disaster. Outstanding!

But requirement cover something...like genitals...or breathing/pandemic transmitting orifice. didn’t take tweets related US handling covid. someone U.S. often talks friends Canada, understand frustration extent. Canada’s inoculation campaign ~3-4 weeks “behind” ours; won’t deny time *is* precious, especially there’s experiencing surge cases deaths.

But comparison apples-to-oranges, perspective necessary. Almost 30% Canadians received least one shot. Canada, country little-to-no domestic vaccine production, “*ahead*” average E.U. member sort access frankly incredible. And, course, much developing world likely unable provide vaccines citizens while.

Add allowed celebrate festivals attend political rallies, happen Seriously needs happen.   health complications likely die senior citizen, given average lifespan Indians around 69ish , see people really treat bodies right age. STAY FUCK HOME REVOLT

Come on. Trust me, started actually looking certain statistics trusting headlines random articles, painted clear picture lot stuff people assume flat true.

I.E. New York Florida almost identical COVID numbers right now, Florida actually cases deaths per day, yet everyone assumes they're state better numbers. disagree US start sharing vaccine soon unfair compare production medicine development medicine. Zealand likely gonna stay travel bubble another year, since take drastic changes find even one case countries.

They really choice get whole population vaccinated. they're fairly low priority list since they're dealing outbreaks like rest world. always seemed funny me. regular Indian cleaner regular American. ""look"" way outset. Also USA becoming extremely vaccinated. I'm gonna need guaranteed paid sick days writing that. Welcome Banana Republic India fuck travel last year then? Okay, okay. real. 7 years ago guy stone face tells government created flu spread could make money cold medicine. 

This 7 years ago really know respond. everyone, majority people don’t even know concept VPN. People find loopholes, point able access content without find loopholes first place.  Borders likely remained closed SA, Brazil, India awhile due concerns variants risk ending back Square 1 one blows up. 

Australia/New Zealand likely gonna stay travel bubble another year, since take drastic measures find even one case countries.

Canada still struggling vaccinate at-risk people, there’s still lot distrust Canada US, they’re option travel bubble either. might go far demand kids vaccinated reopening borders US. Nope, seems like stupid hill stand honest. honestly give two shits named....unless call ""the super shitty bat plague""....because facts stuff don’t understand

what else new What’s tl;dr experience? worse India. 5x estimate likely case somewhere like US - actually CDC estimates [just one infections reported US. US tests way, WAY per capita countries like India. Like, 6 7 times more. US missing 4 every 5 cases... math. People never stopped stepping even 2020 height pandemic's first wave. never wore masks either matter much Modi begs everyone atleast wear mask come unnecessarily. strain infectious. Even got extremely safe sanitized time. US literally equally bad countries vaccinations came Definitely acceptable.
It's basically allowing certain percentage kids possible long term side effects health issues.

In 5-10 years kids asthma lung issues blood issues knows, who's paying that? America healthcare all, lots kids future quality life regression possibly... honestly sounds like different moral compass theres point going discussion since impasse isnt gonna assuaged reddit lol yet US still allowing flights India Brazil. hate people say half medical field take since statistic based like one two cities. recent survey Kaiser Family Foundation found 29% healthcare workers “vaccine hesitant,” figure slightly higher percentage general population, 27%. one perfect either course

You also remember broadly defined medical field. article can't find right showed vaccine hesitancy decreased dramatically among healthcare workers level education increased. largely doctors hesitant People dying enough oxygen : India gouvernment pathetic.
But sure well born need dirty racist cast country I'm actually stunned India bigger problem virus, variant not, now. think sides object anyone saying “both sides” implies even single good person side. implies might single bad person speaker’s side. Given general lack mathematical literacy shudder think happen 3 sides. Well yes course, whole point excuses terrible.

""They're censoring deaths thousands continue making money""

That's real ""excuse."" Takes month bring numbers proper lockdown, so... Always charm encounter casual racism here.

Well, want exactly? saying nobody gets fly travel internationally ever again. reduce transmission point handle small outbreaks (which vaccine does) open again. able control virus point fling everyone open again.  big problem India poor infrastructure huge amounts poor people. gets out, going end completely impossible control.

How looking citizens . called greed pushing American goods throats threatening blackmailing propaganda government . USA govt went wars far less things. Bruh Congratulations, sensible decision get vaccinated likely made recovery faster. 

Flu vaccines notoriously poor preventing disease, (&lt;50% times) yet flu vaccine uptake rates best predictors “good” “bad” flu season. quickly go messy again.

Efficiency reduced, seems like ""Indian"" variant ain't different variants ability escape natural immunity: mRNA vaccines likely still work severe disease. eventually found 15 cases — including three deaths — nearly 8 million doses administered, New York Times bugs bit commonly said denominator 8 million doses administered. whole reason raised concern blood clots impacted younger women, mostly 18-48, group presumably disproportionately represented. Rather saying total population 8 million getting vaccine, many women 18-48 received it? Granted, probably still pretty low risk, way messaged pretty disingenuous misleading could cause mistrust-- something there's much already.

What understand formal recommendation least consideration another option women 18-48 recommended seek one two vaccines they're available?  I'd guess reality women already aware care probably already that... I'm neighboring country Panama. Americans might recall us 1989 small canal.

Hi,

Just wanted see anyone else received AstraZeneca vaccine suffers/suffered persistent headaches?

I first jab 1st April work. I'm 25\[M\] never used get headaches, like ever since jab I've getting noticeable headaches daily basis. headaches go away pain relief meds think I'm blood clot symptoms. Unfortunately it’s dark uk winter outside working hours makes tricky. know several women London regular gym goers unwilling go running dark. Particularly recent case young woman picked policeman killed. Conservative populists situation bad, many people died due lack oxygen, mean fucking believe it!
This crisis could avoided no, votes matter most. 
 painful see people begging oxygen beds. mental health fucked up, pains heart see situation in, situation could totally avoided government actually cared people. seems control. wonder reaches half million. helping others need wrong. Even worse export ban raw materials, nations able produce vaccines. Disgusting. link comment, chance? RW india turning US company 100% work home India offices too, unfortunately people still getting sick take time work care sick family members. hope everyone starts leveling off. CDC report 4.6 actual cases reported case february december 2020, leading estimate 83 million cases time frame. see nothing controversial unrealistic here. 

obviously missing far cases early pandemic now, unrealistic think 4.6 number still valid averaged down. dumb India's part (good thing HCQ turned useless), export 66 million doses vulnerable taken care of, declare virus defeated. shipped 500K doses Canada, heaven's sake.

Let's see plays out.  Biden's play hoard mats sell India expensive mRNA vaccines I'll agree legitimate beef. think really stupid we're NL. One thing need said even though ICUs full, death rate far lower been. suspect government made economic equation considered growing clamor relaxations, decided worth reopen. fact Benelux countries done/are probably adds peer pressure well. think stupid, India position February also totally relaxed we've seen brought them.

In NL we're two-three months offered covid vaccine adults want it, we've already subject restrictions 12 months, wish we'd suck remain vigilant, reason-based science-driven final stretch we'd total relaxation restrictions sooner. Yes, officially made Czechia short name Czech Republic back 2016, way France short name French Republic.

However seems every major country interested banning India flights done it. Major powers USA, China, UK, Germany... domestic situation contained capable sending ventilator/oxygen/Vaccine ingredients India. abject indifference selfishness international community shame. think okay nervous let's look way:

1. US states least 20% population fully vaccinated least 40% half vaccinated. India, vaccinated less 1% population, around 20M people jabbed compared 1 Billion population. 

2. India MANY huge events caused (massive) 3rd wave.

We’ve treated lot hydration, coffee helps, Tylenol. think depends many non vaccinated people immune. europe expects offer adults first dose begin july. mean UK significantly slow down? eu significantly speed up? both? general rule 1st dose 14 days

Source? clinic allowing anyone flu cold like symptoms in? That's basic incompetence even covid. Looking really forward this, rules get decided Monday. drop mandatory quarantine I'll finally able go holiday. First all, govt spreading misinformation. One party chief present govt asked people drink cow urine cure covid-19. Sounds ridiculous right? Morever, many people recieving help online sources including twitter. Also, govt incompetent handle covid crisis. care building mandirs get votes. People arrange oxygen privately, reporting things internet atleast people come forward help. think credible source ever said vaccine useless Indian variant. far, information been: a) mutations area plays role potential immune escape, b) enough data variant yet.

That said, lot news outlets painting grim picture comes variants, even justified. think try listen experts (who saying mutation point vaccines completely useless unlikely, still contain spread vaccinate people gets less chances mutate). 8-9 day doubling going ""fun"" America's migrant camps, forced hysterectomys, separation families, etc. Hard believe still people promoting idea airborne virus spread lack handwashing. want read comment again.

Better educated people see it, older people consistently told risk. mean country complaining genocide genocide('s) vested interest curtailing country ya accept whataboutism  Anyone Florida right causing severe harm others Florida country. meanwhile Germany, every Facebook comment section still full people denying existence covid, calling ""just flue"", demanding government open everything up.

Correct I'm wrong, understanding there's 100% chance even vaccinated person contract covid, they'll worse mild flu symptoms. can't deal problem, deal person report problem. Beats im dumb fucking doctor. point anyway. want people careful even getting vaccine biden tell government Allow Kumb Mela? Gathering 30-50 million people? even supposed happen year changed date ASTROLOGERS deemed necessary Population density hasn’t much predictor vulnerability COVID-19. Hong Kong, Tokyo, Singapore didn’t much problem Dakotas got slammed. How? thought basically told people need vaccines, denied buying several million doses, said vaccine plan stockpile Biden came nothing?..

All know Biden, told it'd June 60yo high risk mom got vaccine, it'd fall me. ended getting vaccines mid March instead. wrote edit. think 95% efficacy means? getting figures? provide link? Eh. #2 true moment appears mRNA vaccines also creating kind antibodies prevent infections transmission altogether (I'm certain types) probably depends much virus exposed to, healthy immune response is, different spike compared original SARS2 virus used vaccine. Multiple variables coming play there.

Public health authorities unwilling make firm call whether reduce transmission scientific community generally wants abundance evidence gathered declaration made. Vaccine inequality vaccine side effects happen overwhelmingly women, COVID ones. Women also likely autoimmune diseases.  National Movement taking shape Astro Turfed major Republican donors ($100,000 VA) leverage troll farms organize masks social distancing schools. flying radar pushed local school board meetings. We're even half vaccinated. stop vaccine production ship supplies India quick enough stop outbreak (caused government mismanagement), it'll guarantee one like it. poor kids Depends long protection lasts for. lasts like 2 years probably don’t need 2nd dose, since get booster shot then. waiting list mine, vaccinating people 45yo I'm moment New variants social distancing due to: political rallies shit-fests. Crossing fingers you. worry India. current exponential growth they're seeing, they're going millions people need hospitalized. they're already running beds, things going get real rough real quick. Hospitalization death statistics lag behind current numbers week two. even stopped spread infection right now, they've got least another week exponential increase hospitalizations least two three weeks exponential increase deaths. Looks like caste system working intended? Cocow-Cola hard lockdown would pointless virus already everywhere. comment seems show independent thinking engaging actual discussion.

Reddit fails function effectively sometimes, time. got back said I’m vaccinated don’t want wear mask vaccine YOU, mask EVERYONE ELSE, walking biohazard

How get upvotes? India running tests use daily. “officially” may peak soon stay peak awhile reality every model saw shows mid-May peak India. think country could worse USA Trump. never unhappy Brazil India prove wrong. Difference completed vaccines contracted decision block raw material exports.

&amp;#x200B;

Very countries producing vaccine also stopped exporting raw materials, UK still ships certain raw materials Europe allow pfizer produce (although Europe slowly switching local supply this) Sounds like need ""Tethics."" dad tee, driving crazy. seen family fifteen months. wife drove six half hours total get vaccinated (two doses), period planning drive fourteen hours total. dad practically retired works single-digit hours per week, schedule. keeps saying he's 'definitely' going get vaccinated, he's waiting literally easy possible, i.e. doctor friend gets shipment J&amp;J drive ten minutes road get it.

I've raised possibility driving *twenty* minutes road number sites offering vaccines months now, mom says ""Don't even bother asking. might well twenty hours away.""  think spread heavily influenced circumstances behavior rather variant much terrible variants.

This right on. 

Variants make little difference, all. quick blame virus increased infection plain day behavior seasonal factors much important influencing spread. really 50% everyone pre-existing immunity get within next 2 weeks so. providing best medical care point, 2 weeks infections drop immunity grows death toll pretty huge really let infect basically everyone **and** medical systems compromised  Saying government nothing interested building Mandirs blatant, exaggerated misinformation. tweet criticizing govt regular poster vile modi bootlicking subreddit. checks out. get might assistance make get appointments, etc. larger issue GQP/Trumpist anti-vaxx/covid-denial nonsense? ran one older person recently, someone scientific background know better previously respected. Disappointing. western countries send vaccines countries instead selfish pricks things could better. no, can't expect altruism former colonizers. Slippery slope fallacy used prove truth ultimate end. 

Slippery slope meritless rhetorical point. Many things end slippery slopes, predictably so. logical fallacy render discussion invalid.  Since countries seem going prediction immunity lasts year, December, it’s gonna time at-risk people get vaccinated again.

They might well let people doses enjoy months freedom it’s time get vaccinated again. Sorry loss. recommend therapy help getting grief. Landfill know it’s fine differing opinions, want argue public, learn effectively without straw-man labelling all. Attack ideas, person. Calmly effectively state points, highlight logical fallacies etc. That’s bud. recent surge attributed degree complacency people officials assumed virus beaten, lifted restrictions returned old habits, well emergence new virulent variants. surge devastating nation’s health infrastructure hard hit cities like capital New Delhi extremely difficult find available hospital beds. Amid mounting health crisis, government moving vaccinate people quickly possible, though sheer size population makes daunting task. pfizer gang rise up! all? working class families single parents young kids children then? know science required holy permission quite accurate. There’s emerging body evidence Barr body plays much larger role previously thought  use rulebook job like that. not? Using list things already determined false perfectly fine.  though? tried weeks day night get dose 1 Rite-Aid finally checked local Walmart got appointment less minute Wednesday. still pulling strings long vaccine effective? know months, hopefully get answers soon. False news. refused India's repeated requests send raw materials vaccine production citing 'America First'. Till day, India recieved aid US since 2nd wave started. see, that's problem right there. know means, schools teach us go college, even might taught it.

Biden really should’ve closed borders now. Argentineans, special kids world. Half genius half short-bus. Either cull people virus lockdown. Pick poison.

Let's pretend anything labelled anything conspiracy theory BS.

Right would go indoor restaurant, theater plane used vaccine passport system. community spread over, would feel comfortable things mixed company. probably always wear mask flu season crowds public transportation though. It’s great getting sick whole year get flu probably every year despite flu vaccines. 

Some things never return though. don’t want ever go back 2019 socializing levels. found happier spending time home family instead going more. also found didn’t miss seeing people much decided don’t owe time others obligation. also never associate people didn’t take pandemic seriously. values don’t align way see fundamental.  Can't better said. think ""dismissive"" quite apt describe feel, ""grimly realistic"". group get shot, there's virtually nothing outside federal state mandate forcing to. Facts, data, logic, going sway people. fact idea trying sway makes suspicious unlikely take shot.

These places likely suffer last ""Waves"" pandemic U.S. winter areas achieved herd immunity. hope flare ups isolated able contained. Good, want crappy 4g mind control chip. they’d stop testing, wouldn’t new cases. Double penetrated vaccine. sanitized.

It’s good clean sanitary. experience India, much wasn’t. probably saw good areas. 

But part, COVID seems clean sanity. sharing air. point remains many people small spaces. Well, maintenance inhaler asthma $400-500 month. Everyone able swing that, problem. /s Wow! Yes, please stay there. Even NYC looking really good right now. Cool. uncovered diabolical plot hatched CCP spread COVID across globe? wonder GRS medical facilities operating (which quite different tourism). There's huge difference caring India recognizing even US sent every single vaccine has, prevent blunt current surge. Big difference giving something away spare, giving away need emergency situation blaming others fall short. won’t end well. Thank you! 💚 fine. reason think backup case Pfizer and/or Moderna runs problems. made vaccine manufacturing distribution look easy see J&amp;J not. ~25 million doses US one week's supply.

I expect release soon especially J&amp;J vaccine back. Yeah, five months later are. said something extremely foolish I'm sure going admit now.  Great Depression great analogy. 

I asked 10 yo yesterday like part historic event, said, ""Kind boring actually."" Lol Prime minister stick Vaccines also reduce chance infection. lot. Get shots. yeah, break law go jail/are executed, disobey order go military prison/are executed. big difference. since edited post feedback another redditor, roughly though. think mean rate vaccination, rate virus spread know what's higher 20%...any fucking vaccines. firstly didnt test anyone wanted test, didnt vaccinate anyone needed one...then reduced healthcare budget 1.3 percent GDP, even sub saharan countries keep 5% ..then centralised resources donations PM's fund...and didnt use, ignored warnings didnt covid taskforce meet feb-march...then called massive elections many states staggered month...and also opened stadium 100k people packed opening, let 10-100 million attendee kumbh festival go ahead...i think still going elections.

how help country?

The rich well connected 1.5% got fully vaccinated prompty started dance around country invincible supermen. one's house fire would feel embarrassed call fired department? bring lot good points data. Clearly, know topic me. I’d like see us Americans help whatever capacity able. us standing idly bye excess resources helps one. Among hashtags removed, one hastag ""#CoronavirusIsAConspiracy"".

Lockdown kill spread within 2 weeks Typical totalitarian government  Indian here, looking scary now. Everyday hearing relatives either dieing getting infected. would need every bit help every country possible. Get us oxygen, ventilators, medicines Antarctica even too.  think pretty common sense outdoor risk really, really quite low, particularly -- mean, vaccinated person, wearing mask outdoors, mean, obviously, risk believe going hearing, country going hearing soon updated guidelines CDC. CDC science-based organization. want make guidelines unless look data, data backs look around commonsense situation, obviously, risk really low, particularly vaccinated.

I mean, makes sense. Obviously impression health system better Canada now.

Lol replied one thing well mean US's health care system better. Vaccine manufacturing even really health care system, industry.

Would like explain US three times deaths per capita COVID-19 compared Canada?

What concern troll are. Brewdog offered UK pubs government vaccine centres even made beer give people got vaccinated one pubs.

We already saw Israel, pissed manufacturers sending doses places without authorization, later played rules still got authorization send elsewhere. Depends is.

People masked up, made effort distance, got workout done got out. gym hadn’t open, last year would lot tougher sure. many people want vaccine somehow became political thing. months worth lockdown (no repeating open/lockdown) 2020 hotel quarantine. it, cases tremendously low countries world. Jaw pain one common symptoms listed cdc site Yup. 1st dose yesterday. definitely stop spread neighbor. /s agree. 

And called profesional deals daily things due pandemic. 
I know possible diagnose covid via dental assessment hence asking covid forum etc. . 

But fear real family.

 polite respectful strongly disagreed though medical training. right wrong grossly unprofessional issue (that's another issue lol). 

The symptoms persist adamant I'm going motions say mistaken.

But symptoms ive listed known covid related ? wish know possibility right...ideally link something possible...

Thank assume men women quantity vaccine shot? shame would difficult qualify smaller volume. Someone extrapolate global population... Days outbreak, man showed COVID-19 symptoms refused colleagues’ suggestions go home self-isolate, police said statement.

Isn't part boss supposed step make go home? Lack investment centre satate medical infrastructure one year period first second wave, lack scientific advisory economic field( chief economic advisor dumb fuck govt still listen God knows whatever reason) , lack actual established personal involved decision making regarding health infrastructure pandemic. nobody would make deal President lasted longer term. BC, Ontario, Quebec. lot don’t realize there’s one vaccine available, either. Skip doughnut go straight good old fashioned medical grade lard! Yeah comment days ago contract AZ doesn’t allow us gift doses hence “lent” Canada mexico. wish could find highest ever cases now? 50% positivity rate *never* representative whole population.

In way, it'd blessing were, would mean virus would quickly run people infect, despite insane R number.

However, 50% positivity people getting tested either feeling sick exposed someone who's tested positive. that's case, strongly suggests either:

* tests rationed enough tests test people whose lives danger need determine best treatment; and/or
* COVID dominant cause people feeling sick.

People feel sick, get tested scenario. community cases Aus take time rollout vaccine It’s effective two bad press? thanks. made appointment vaccine called schedule mentioned J J, said thanks.

Clinically speaking, gain immunity taking vaccine, that's whole point it. also gain immunity contracting virus. term immunity mean never able contract since immunity wear off. small number people also gain immunity vaccine, likely develop serious illness virus, studies Israel shown.

These medical facts, readily available CDC websites. things simple facts rly opinion way. complain one year later still forced wear mask one year later. That's criticism, talking covid masks, opinion inconvenienced government sucked every step pandemic. However posting shit masks really work (factually wrong) vaccine dangerous something talk prove point scientific reasoning. subjects posts easy interpreted like this, doable Cnnmmm There's lot word twisting article make comments seem negative actually were, infuriating still pedaling narrative vaccinated people spread virus.

These life saving, pandemic stopping vaccines need given India hard hit areas ffs! nasal flu vaccine live. flu shot live. headaches bad fortunately nausea. mainly ""I'm coming something"" feeling mostly wanted sleep couple days. 

The arm poll pain unbelievably bad though, especially first shot, got ""Moderna arm"" too, fun. Also, government seems competent one India right now. makes lot sense. Vaccinated people much less risk also motivate people get vaccinated. enough people vaccinated cases low, think quarantine restrictions dropped. I’d say chances summer much better last summer getting larger every day see insane number vaccinations taking place number increase summer. Oh guys care free speech?

I’d like hear Biden admin itself. “Here’s we’re exporting Oxford/AZ vaccines right now, here’s needs happen will. Here’s deal “raw materials hoarding”, here’s must happen release those.”

It's masks many Asian countries wear masks regularly even flu season. never got rid flu. New Zealand required masks since September coronavirus flu.

So, common measure countries taken could affect flu? likely quarantines travel restrictions.

If ever met people flu vaccine, notice still get sometimes. Yes doctor here. However currently treating COVID patients. friends colleagues working COVID wards touch also coordinating ICU beds people reaching me. friend pulmonologist steadily receiving lung imaging (CT,XRAYs) people suspected COVID. 

From gathered: 
- young &amp; healthy people equally affected 
- time onset symptoms deterioration O2 saturation short. 
- fever
- get imaging done waiting results.
- 40-50% lung involvement even mild symptoms. 
- doctors managed get infected past 15-16 months testing positive even good PPE. first shot vaccine mild symptoms.

For example: 28 year old male, healthy, comorbidities chest discomfort sore throat. got CT done waiting COVID test result. CT showed features viral pneumonia 43% lung involvement. O2 92. Today morning developed severe breathlessness O2 dropped 66. report came back hours ago COVID positive. could've huh travel Asia flu originated every year. amazing people continue deny impact global travel disease spread. China already exporting lot vaccines, many countries primarily vaccinating Sinovac Sinopharm vaccines. Pfizer supply outside first world limited, matter pay, AZ even worse. Argentina brought Sinopharm receive enough Sputnik V Russia. Yeah completely wrong, since high positivity rate obviously shows cases growing people building immunity.

That said, positivity rate tells something *current* situation, immunity general. Conclusions draw high positivity rate virus control lot cases tests show. enough tests done capture current cases. Fuck I'm vaccinated right Hmm population that's literally exploding find space live, added greatest sanitation practices poorer parts, corrupt government.

Sounds like Covid buffet.  planes still flying. Even 99% air traffic down, takes one person one flight introduce variant (mind govt officials rich always find way leave regardless). Plus, many Indians already flown country since new wave started bit late try enforce anyone leaving entering. Holy fuck. possible partners like Bayer GSK, Pfizer natural choice BioNTech previously worked definitely capable. Working alone would possible well (BioNTech independent manufacturing plant running now), would've meant slower process less doses.

Polio passes threshold vaccination virtually every scenario. incorrect. hard lockdown always reduce spread virus. might everywhere terms every municipality, every person household yet. Locking country keep entering new areas, keep entering new human hosts. 

I've seen reasonable arguments major lockdown India, mostly Indian government stable enough wealthy enough support poor country said lockdown, they're kind stuck rock hard place. US, Europe, AU/NZ, etc, could lock theory could still feed ourselves. India might able that. locking could cause widespread famine leading even deaths simply India apparently can't keep everyone fed. However, idea lockdown function eliminate spread virus accurate all. never late pull proverbial ripcord.  Sometimes people get busy need wait bit take time work get second shot. People regularly told there's good chance bad side effects, take time work. get it, anticipate side effects. people luxury.

Some people really bad reaction first shot (which I've seen really bad reaction first shot, likely already covid, similar second shot booster anyway) scared go get second shot.

And lastly, I'm sure there's many people see '80% effectiveness one shot' go 'eh, good enough!'.

Considering amounts less 10% people, supposedly (I read locally numbers 40% skipping it, must much higher locally nationally, interesting) think we're pretty darn good.

Perhaps can’t come agreeable solution. know deciding honor there’s plenty reneging, especially last years, seems trite think honoring commitments important, even they’re crappy don’t like them, can’t say I’m 100% board approach, want see US oversupply put good use. solution can’t found soon I’d board way. important caveat don’t many extras moment. 30 million AZ unfortunately drop bucket India. Surely better zero, consequential broad scale. want see get put use, maybe renegotiating results ability send more, consistently, would support that. It’s nuanced situation needs sorted ASAP, think everyone agree that. Literally everyone know vaccinated. don’t interact haven’t we’re lucky people surrounded similar views own. know risk low, I’m still wary going back normal. logical reason? Probably not. past year, media, stories, etc. traumatizing it’s hard suddenly switch thinking “it’s okay now.” wish could, I’m yet. little kids know likely affected flu every year this. brain still says: “What let guard down? always regret waiting little longer?” live like bay everything? No. it’s hard make mental switch. respect everyone’s feelings you’re vaccinated: want go party, go it!! you’re still ready, that’s ok too! post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Just ever headline. much truth. disconnect - state hospitals rusted oxygen bottles gurneys probably 50 years old another world - nuclear armed nation space program.   developed world 2020 America: “you’re 3rd world country way you’ve botched handling covid.”

The developed world 2021 America:
“Y u help us? It’s fair.” Awesome Merkel. Canada. Let’s step too. another reason need take aggressive measures beat west quickly. need help rest world aren’t rich us. maybe vulnerable people get vaccinated thing American government honor contracts worst pay bit money.  aCkUaLlY Additionally, India much fewer medical resources per capita. I'm city 1 million getting 500 cases per day, already hospitals full.  CDC never put statement may make seem like 2nd dose optional. 

From studies, 2 weeks first dose 70% effective. 2 weeks second dose 90%+ effective. 

Cant tell do, personally would things go out, still wear mask indoors also minor nuisance Seems likely.

Unfortunately, people country fucked people get shit together probably wish efforts less selfish, would expect anything selfishness given track record? got second jab yesterday feel like complete shit now. pain couldn’t sleep properly. *some* protection, enough CDC consider full vaccinated. Take will, laws cannot partially vaccinated. personally days first dose, adjusting routine two weeks second dose.

That said, routine much already taking acceptable risk, i.e. hanging people going eat. Varies study, 65%

Edit: efficacy, infection rate. Talk burying lede Release patents send materials need make vaccines. Share tech manufactured world.

So basically, tell Pfizer, Moderna J&amp;J ""thanks vaccine we're gonna steal IP"". soon next pandemic hits, guess companies gonna interest making vaccine.....  lockdowns work. listening science works. Closing hospital capacity overloaded works. Testing much possible works. hiding cases works. Providing free accessible covid care isolation facilities work. I'll say lie.

Something would drastically get worse coming months justify another year half current status quo got Singapore Iran...? I’ve seeing pics fromt page Australia 70k+ packed concerts Try lockdowns &amp; ban religious/political gatherings like countries did.  It’s pandemic show compassion fellow human beings less selfish &amp; sacrificing staying home. 

Full lockdowns work. economy already pretty bad imposing complete lockdown would destroy it. 

Last year, government imposed lockdown first wave, lot poor migrant labourers came work cities jobs hence go back villages hundreds even thousands kilometers away.

Since lockdown, forms public transport like trains restricted, migrant labourers make journey village cycling walking.

Some could reach villages, actually died sun walking thousands kilometers. Many people left unmarked doubt people even got proper funeral families even got notified deaths.

Imposing lockdown good everything, maximum middle class/upper class people might suffer pay cut/dent revenue. really case lower middle class/poor people probably working contract labourers, hawking vegetables, etc. affected most. unlike say, US Australia, people magically get thousand dollars month provided government(and think government afford anyways). think meant discourage mingling people come with.

Very, children dying. happen, higher rate seasonal flu. Oh, disagree. think important young people aware risks potential consequences careful. We've fed ""young people safe, kids get COVID"" BS since beginning essentially brainwashed lot people thinking they're invincible, clearly case. That's they're held. all. don’t think people realize standard childhood vaccines, like MMR TDP 80% US. think you’ll see maybe 70% spots, 50% others. 80%+? going happen. keep mind demographic also includes frail elderly past 80 (even 90) whose family may feel covid may quicker less painful end slow decline bedridden feeding tube. know parents' friend husband who's nearing 80 advanced Parkinsons. quality life severely diminished, got disabled stage kept apologizing family putting position &amp; burden. agree somewhat, take quite time. believe conditions improve far threshold it, thus won’t necessary.

Well whatever works options. Thanks. don’t understand science. average aged adults children dying variant strains?

The largest bulk still 65+ Sure whatever said makes much sense definitely decreasing demand amongst unvaccinated. Hence also sending concentrators Yet one rich conman ever run president successfully Yeah reply aged well, country stable state Definitely - vaccinate area large population size still avoid crowding/rush vaccines maintaining social distancing particular state opposition controlled one states India fudging numbers. hit 80% elderly. reason cannot hit 80% population children approved vaccinated schools require it. FANTASTIC !!!!

the wartime embargo helping anyone use case, us Inidia, anyone. Yeah, slowing finish line approaches. annoying expected.  Texas second highest population state besides California, talking raw numbers course have. that's pointless meaningless comparison, need compare per capita doses given. 

Texas given least one dose 36.8% population, closer bottom top. California given least one dose 46.1% population. half dozen states already number 50%, another 3 49.x% going hit day downvotes, guess people like it’s bad there. “under 40% vaccination rate... we’re lucky”

Is accurate? D.C. city one highest ratios visitors/non-residents U.S. Lack incoming travelers probably individual policies (which werent much different cities). Maharashtra's testing remained consistent around 260,000 tests day. cases hovering 65k cases per day two weeks now.

Biden interested improving much-better-off America

He's president US, obviously priorities going aligned US interests. incredibly naive think otherwise. 

It seems pretty clear wants enough Pfizer/Moderna/J&amp;J doses inoculate entire US population taking foot pedal, makes sense since we've seen J&amp;J production supply chains always bulletproof. 

We certainly disburse AZ doses gathering dust, since we're never going touch them, there's plenty PPE could donate well, whole thali banging get raw materials US cost US production capacity reasonable expectation moment. gentleman thumbnail appear younger patient. Voltaire, c. 18th century Yeah, flu absolutely miserable. flu completely knocks out: bed week, barely eat, always feeling like throw go bathroom (for times stomach food), high fever, etc. I’m obviously making generalization, don’t lose 5-10 pounds span week, didn’t flu. bad cold coupled fever. probably didn’t coin it, popular Obama administration.  guess it’s factor low testing - 50k tests state 90mn people. Nope. doses EU received either Belgium US. Dutch factory soon start deliver too. Excellent news. good India whole world including America itself. Obviously bad. ;). Paywalled. AstraZeneca already severely reduced weeks shipment EU. Canceling next weeks hardly notice horrible news. Hopefully delay rather problem doses due. suddenly forget time EU block vaccins producted Europe leaving enough population? Yes, oxygen concentrators. really odd reason since US often whatever likes suits them, regardless law contracts.

I've actually saying weeks already millions vaccines sit unused criminal. need dire enough able power contractual barrier way we've universally emergency authorised vaccines without years adequate testing. think possibility, remote one something I'd bet on. United States would send raw materials required India manufacture Covishield vaccine, well therapeutics, rapid diagnostic test kits, ventilators protective equipment frontline workers.   United States also pursuing options provide India oxygen generation related think they've probably thought that... Please upvote post move on. I've heard quote times can't place origin. Where's from? india worst respiratory health planet , vast percentage whole population crippled asthma etc. anything else expected? really cant calculated doubt even close 100% population gets vaccinated + majority shots 2 doses, could see world vaccinating 60-70M easily day everyone supply Well, grateful kinds aid Germany provides. There’s bunch oxygen concentrators well. expect indefinitely. continue mutate control worldwide decades imagine. Gone days hanging Dr office waiting rooms going concerts, let alone travel etc. ... People need wrap heads around reality. extremely bigoted assume women two X chromosomes. outdated bunk science. Ok, spot difference. racism. Please delete comments black people police. thing. Yes. completed June.  Add infected recovered (both kids unvaccinated adults), yeah, it'll enough. Covid19 stay. long follow guidelines get vaccinated, do. Cannot lock us again,, worked work future.   think, unless sickness old, walking 30 minutes problem human being. you’re carrying virus. Sorry. It’s not. Ahh yes tradegedy country vaccinating citizens outside country something litterly every country does(except israel still vaccinated palastinians country) Yeah mix match vaccines. millions got Oxford vaccine get 2nd dose either BioNtech Moderna instead. 

The UK trial limited numbers people opted trial. scale data Germany Denmark dramatically larger obviously one opted trial, rather decision made them. 

Personally I've issues mix matching reason would dangerous less effective. much likely different 2 doses vaccine, although potentially could even effective.  vaccinated girlfriend face yesterday.  numbers can't trusted $16.95, think much money you’ll save, lol.. 🤣 thing comment replying oc. Funny thing made front page January export numbers released latest numbers released *crickets*

"" [Official exports EU jumped 46.6%, £3.7bn, £11.6bn, following January's 42% slump firms struggled new trade rules""

* still think brexit stupid * mom described flu way. said, past years high fever, highest 100.5°F last summer. faster spread particular variants ? ;) that's real question. comment based quote confident able produce sufficient number vaccines achieve goal collective immunity, means 70% adult population would vaccinated mid-July,"" European Internal Market Commissioner Thierry Breton said.

Even 70% adult population fully vaccinated sufficient herd immunity? thought threshold thought likely around 70% total population (and emergence transmissible strains).

That level vaccination would huge effect numbers hospitalisations deaths I'm certainly negative - querying whether would actually achieve herd immunity. looked data deaths US, hasn’t exactly plummeted nearly non existent majority old people fully vaccinated? Probably closer 30% according estimates best projection site entire pandemic. Obviously lot regional variation. portion missed cases would constant, might 9 10 spring 2020 wave 2 3 end year. Herd immunity threshold probably least 60%, significant overlap vaccinated previously infected number people immune right estimated. donating isn’t allowed, sell countries dollar.

Not dollar per dose. dollar them. India factory right?

I mean mind, would prioritize India rn.  Given pandemic crises parts world rn feel right.   Phone stowed away, completely sober, alert? Glad we're something least. What's sad cases fall along party lines. Oh completely agree paper is, reality isn't.

If government recognises something without consequence, continue thing without consequence.

And start getting argument ""Well censored be"", immediately lost essence free speech. think need realize Covid-19 isn’t ever gonna eradicated. Pandemic end even Covid-19 still exists. welcome, long there's actual vaccines sent, I'll hold you. case Twitter moderator, liable content website. point never completely eradicate virus. Boy bill maher right non stop negative reporting, even things going well. Get clicks. Atmanirbhar strongman image intensifies. See comment sources. mean yeah sure, that's true. could say thing social distancing restriction. people still wear mask still rule. point anywhere US lockdown ever ridiculous. think risk isn’t flushing much using toilet someone else used.  People genuinely got idea privileged somehow like take credit things absolutely involvement in, apart luck draw born certain geographical location. decide others who've lost draw abandoned suffering blamed, despite also involvement control situation. think compare now. Florida traded lives illness economy. They’ve never denied it. That’s even controversial. 

What bothered people used compare Florida favorably California Florida 5% deaths per capita. 

They didn’t California. worse, traded money. COVID denial express ticket ban; Twitter want blood hands. Surely praying solve problems eh Yep - better lock forever. Society over. Get vaccine definitely don’t think live normal life ever again. Great plan! Cringe good gone sub - byebye 😘  Companies responsibility standing laws governments, they're going claim care free speech, Twitter claim. reality care money.  late guys. Nice.

I hope people offered help Brazil well things collapsed last month. India worse state however looks like. UK government also publishes statistics here: page tracking UK covid rates.  remember Germany destroying import/export economy potential lives children paraoxsym racism recently, true. addition variability protection it’s expected durable (long-lasting) without second dose. One may better nothing, designed start two-injection vaccine. fucking frustrating see people year ago side science came things like lockdowns restrictions shouting “bUt variaNTs!” time talk going back pre-pandemic normal brought up. certainly give unemployment benefits 1.3 billion people. ultra wealthy class benefited laws keep people extreme poverty. need safety net Rally fallout... Wow, remember back late December AZ still projected used vaccine US? far I'm allowed mingle countless households freely I'm work can't meet fixed group friends work even negative test result .

I hand number people deemed ""essential workers"" (one two actually essential, rest not) I've seen, right big driver small private gatherings. People zero mood observe protocols telling hang work friends home they'd seen week work, especially given absolutely abysmal governmental response USA - trash-tier financial support, bearded Spock universe level public health management Tr*mp's band hand-picked imbeciles, etc. no, didn’t delete tweet based china’s request. contrary, deleted tweets posted Chinese officials. China don’t give shit tweet, ban already. Good luck getting Malaysia. I'm also vaccinated father lived 20 years passed year, access denied see go funeral. I'm waiting get access go pack home ship back Europe. cost around €2000 hotel quarantine, fees, flights etc. easy travelling region covid even fully vaccinated. means nothing citizens still waiting vaccines. Best travel locally save money countries ready willing host tourists boy need money. It’s clear, documented party divide vaccine resistance. denying reality? stupidity flu people look rich people like Putin. built sanitizing device made people quarantine meeting him. 

You ask kind intelligence hes going extremes. Troll Bullshit. shipped 50 million useless HCQ Trump tantrum made threats. here.

Most people get infected home family. one person disciplined causes entire family get it. study specifically warns shared toilets. Insanity  even cohesive. Indian idea he's referring opposition leader, Rahul Gandhi, instead people power. *Neckbeard noises* minor cold tiny portion vaccinated population worth shutting anything down? think so. Vaccines both. mRNA vaccines, particular, absolutely good job preventing infection severe infection. They're ~95% effective infection every ~20 unvaccinated people catch COVID19 expect see 1 vaccinated person catch it. Efficacy percentage comparing positive cases vaccine/placebo arms phase 3 trials (30,000 people each). one thinks they're friends. right we're no-holds-barred cultural death struggle take weapons get. Redditors shambles. Fuck oath legit 🤝🙏 lol! whybash rahul gandhi?
rahul gandhi represents opposition party. party rules centre incompetent one. Based first page post history looks like America lives rent free head.  many vaccines shipping there? vaccine development started though, fuck up, knowing him, would easily see absolutely deny vaccine funding covid exist.

The guy horrible person way possible, mean make correct decisions while. already got king That's courage right thing comes in. Reddit. year ago say China would labeled bigot. Inaccurate. Despite state removal mandates - nearly major cities counties kept place. many businesses still enforce social distancing masking even mandates present. Texas case counts test positivity continues drop state administered vaccines state besides California. suggest research spouting misinformation. 

Usually kids die covid aren’t dying blood clots.

If want worry something kids flu 100x deadly kids covid. EU announced activating help plan. Curious see US gonna send fat vaccine surplus have... 25% eligible adult population.  waiting Fall Winter. Hope international travel gets easier cheaper then. domestic stuff Summer. blame them. Fuck modi. Go ahead, sanction weaker countries thats america works. give bird back 2005, 300$ HIV medications weren’t really helping Africas HIV epidemic. Pfizer researching asians isnt Americas fault, thats see it, go ahead. isnt high efficacy local ones, surprised hesitancy buy vaccines we’re already manufacturer doses? never asked shit free, thats americans think Indians, itll loss ig. didnt realise, Argentina many assets military base, know. like government assets forex reserves, maybe thats could asking for. Cant wait complain China taking Sri Lankan ports failure pay back loans, American company wants it, ok. Somewhat hypocritical guess. Recently, Pfizer agree sell profit price Indian govt, dont see arguing this. 

Then again, think I’m asking free doses, keep thinking way. Maybe Americans used predatory lending, fairly new concept India large scale, maybe dont know much it. know asking military base isnt first thing asking collateral theres many things ask for. 

Again, fuck modi. hate shouldnt reflect onto people dying here, thats like people saying Americans deserve suffering got Trump in. Maybe happen, shouldnt. Probably means pandemic fake I'm one people knew got flu shot regularly covid, wonder change now. People hate vaccines much what, help reduce chances getting sick reduce chances getting severely ill get sick, people see worthwhile advantage nuts (aside people serious health conditions can't get vaccinated, course, I'm talking healthy people perfectly able get vaccinated choose to.) too. India produces huge amount pharmaceuticals. there's control epidemic India, US/UK/Canada seniors going short drugs keep alive good quality life. know anything Indian government people deserve support.   Also would bet scammy cold calling, even done offshore call centers probably loops back American companies. India sophisticated military aircraft carriers, 4th generation fighters, etc. able handle logistics keeping civilian population alive couple weeks. Delivering bag rice bag lentils every household complicated.  Poland announced won’t get AZ Moderna next week - 1M less vaccines expected :/ u literated? US refuse export material save lives, Biden killing Indian people so, Trump ""American First "" types people seems now. Indians forget, forgive easily. Maybe Russia better ally last. hope link human rights equitable distribution. Check happened flu virus, changes vaccines year fight it.

Flu vaccine educated gambling. choose strain target fail hundred thousands die.

Plus brief comment seems weird definition evolution. pretty accepted right adaptations casual, species change adapt, adapt mutations made able survive (I'm dumbing down, main point mutations lead evolution, two separate routes) everywhere. really based location. parks city remained open state parks closed peak covid outbreaks certain counties.  Wow, great! virus mutations dont really affect efficacy vaccines....its pretty rare mutations random, due high concentration, like bacteria.  India incubator wholy new variants now. even assertion, Smart Man? ""It's bullshit"" means what?  Vaccines work? (the US) tons Astrazeneca vaccine even ever going use. ridiculous refusing export it. Americans know this, realize unreasonable government being. Finish line 11 days 4 hours. That's precisely I'll 2 weeks beyond second Moderna dose. resume normal life visiting family homes, gym, travel dine inside restaurants bars. Even sit breakroom work lunches rather retreating car. course still wear mask required. 

At least I'll feel ""free"" things outdoor activities, camping takeout/delivery time.  US downward trend new cases. Even states like Michigan trending wave Covid cases last weeks. states upticks start April (PA, NJ) trended week too. 

Even like 50% population vaccinated still cause significant downtrend cases. expect May trend even more. Wearing mask hell lot less uncomfortable ventilator sitting hospital waiting oxygen can't breathe. true, yesterday report inner cities people gather still get drunk partying. live suburb regularly hear parties night. People less likly stuff cannot get home easily curfew over. cases you’re probably right I’ve seen data back claim. We’ll see. Yup, boy Bill Gates already said next plan... ehh pandemic worse mild one.

;) I’m young DC, friends vaxxed. Last weekends bars (still limited 6 table, standing) beer gardens, gatherings apartments. Feels good returning normal life!! Here’s fun summer ahead totally pea-brained farts scheduled month long election. Already provided India $1.4 billion. Biden can't legally give raw materials India used Defense Production Act produce/procure them. really hope anti-vaxxers ruin us. shipping moral support. work. many false negatives. could get quite close 100 percent. Vaccines aren’t effing problem. ton load available people hesitant get them. healthcare workers skeptical getting COVID vaccines many places.

Try lockdowns &amp; ban religious/political gatherings like countries did. It’s pandemic show compassion fellow human beings less selfish &amp; sacrificing staying home. didn’t hear U.S fault anyone initial shortcomings. Geez get grip best example (it gets muddier people preexisting antibodies). see plot jump significantly naive individuals make sure Germany EU charge making sure help goes need it, handed mismanaged. Oh Marxist watch BOO!!! 1 billion vaccines given deaths tied even hundreds yet. Getting bed dangerous. Sending positive thoughts family. hope mother recovers quickly. wish implemented reduced access park house. huge park stop running unmasked people swarming trails totally oblivious exercising. sprained ankle twice going trail get around group unmasked people gave up. China used Covid hurt India. Check Weibo, celebrating crying. humanity China practices? vaccinated, covid becomes significantly less dangerous flu. TIL! consider fairly touch things like this. googled hockey star David Pastrnak summary results wiki window says born Czechia click though actual Wikipedia page says Czech Republic. Still adjusting. Commendable gesture. incredibly correct. media trying downplay Biden simply he’s Democrat god knows would used Trump. 

The people claimed keep Biden “check” turning blind eye downplaying this. It’s ugly hell, unsurprising. people said push Biden left make progressive. Yeah okay. Thanks Merkel think ever got doses India. reason India exported half vaccines produced - Corporates run things. upon time Anthony Fauci told millions Americans shouldn’t wear masks, I’m Covid-misinformation spreader lol good one Reuters. right threshold simple binary situation course. also agree vaccine hesitancy likely major factor supply constraints point. seems third wave generally falling across Europe (not countries) hopefully see another wave anywhere near serious one. Biden can't legally give raw materials India used Defense Production Act produce/procure them. However, US provide money India help.  silly, US countries EU also sending aid. Use Google ffs. Nope, laying facts ""just let want protected wear masks"" good option flu control. One reasons flu cases plummeted masks preventing people getting sick, preventing people spreading it. That's I'm pointing out. expect us rapidly go back sick winter, plan wearing mask going unless I'm sick maybe even then, I'm honest. Sounds like using better mask actually would benefit work place

N95 get home depot like 2$ per mask would ideal

They sell explicitly dusty environments, like sanding That's pretty human NZ could send Jacinda bit, would good help. lacking management....not resources. source? Yeah stop talking topics clearly don’t know enough about. I’m sorry harsh you’re part spreading COVID misinformation, it’s serious problem. know heart right place please stop posting emotions versus understanding issue massive challenges COVID brings. control every car road?  mild covid always “minor cold” problem 30 million doses AZ collecting dust southwest Ohio. I’m sure we’re waiting on. Well used 2500 deaths per day we’re 700s Sure, don’t want sacrifice time benefit others. Maybe sounds cold selfish, choose commuting work seeing kids mornings weekends help junior coworkers build person connections advance careers spending time kids, I’m choosing kids every time. know several people got pfizer shot, none side effects day. soon. bigger problem workplace dusty environment. Symptomsaren't bad I'm home. tell people something don’t understand don’t want hear happens. one announced they’re sending vaccines...Merkel didn’t say Germany sending. US announced they’re sending aid, also didn’t specify what. 

Also point India need health care workers supplies vaccines. There’s many positive cases right now, takes least two weeks vaccines effective. Who’s going set infrastructure wide vaccine distribution they’re already strained providing sick? There’s way they’re going get shots arms faster Covid able spread. need slow spread need aid support healthcare systems. Kinda jive well whole sending aid thing. Ventilators PPE help unless stem tide new cases barely bandaid. post locked due deluge racism. better. situation India pretty concerning, really hope spawn mutations resistant vaccines. would lot helpful India’s population wasn’t fucking big. Still every little helps suppose. Immunity also gained getting virus recovering. 50 percent get vaccinated 30 percent get virus.... reach herd immunity.  Worked many times many places, work necessary. teacher, would like federal government research expect impact students. various age ranges socio economic levels. impact high school students look like short term vs long term. elementary kindergarten ages? best strategies mitigating damage done education wise social development wise? 

This going nationwide/global issue years come would nice planned coordinated response instead leaving teachers try sort own... I’m surprised. People couldn’t moderately inconvenienced even moment pandemic... can’t tell many people i’ve heard say want JnJ can’t bothered going back 2nd shot 😅🤷🏻‍♂️ dont know idiot convinced indian leaders higher cases bad thing. case tested positive, another spreader caught ....the cases better catching spreaders infected people giving attention.

Instead hiding cases, higher cases badge honour. think whoever administrating vaccines make clear person immunity instantaneous. Reddit news articles pushing it. fully agree, US allies global south direr needs Canadians complain online People comprehend takes time figure whether certain virus dangerous not. lots new strains viruses popping every year. first death reported Nov. 2019 Chinese news. would taken serious, people always die virus.

In mid January world warned virus might dangerous potentially lead pandemic, China decided act then. However, world listen. rest world waited mid March actually sort lockdowns. 

People blame China, ignore worst spreaders disease. 

If Virus originated US, might taken much longer world react it. people love say China flue, reminded Spanish flu originated US. part get annual shot wear mask sick I’m still going say thank I’m symptomatic I’d say reopen country, seal borders non essential travel. say worrying mutations.  Israel think hit herd immunity 56% vaccinated 15% previously infected - 71%.

We're 38% vaccinated + 20% infected - 58% vaccinated.

How close 13% gap? 

I think it'll take opening vaccinations kids people getting infected. Certainly curfew means everyone public time rather spread throughout 24-hour day? least necessary trips luck governments start neglecting pandemic preparedness again. Scientists public health experts taking possibility pandemic like seriously along, decisions like disbanding underfunding pandemic task forces maintaining strategic PPE reserves purely political decisions anyone half brain could see disastrous. is? winter say scarves unreasonable face coverings?  sub insufferable. Good news y’all still find way complain  - US: haven’t finished Phase III trials here.

- UK: it’s weird, published Phase III trials March went silent it’s like don’t even exist. AFAIK, didn’t even file approval MHRA. guys corrected me, northeast states bought 40m vaccines, getting time. That’s odd. texas dental association convention happening 2 weeks live person simple risk losing job. eradicate smallpox, polio one almost gone that, want. Moderna's credit they're ahead game this. already potential vaccines H7N9, Nipah Zika pipeline, three viruses get scientists shitting most.  that’s true vaccinate active people first, one spread covid anyway. negative REALLY bad. fair Hospitals barely, all, overrun previous surges, one vaccinated. overwhelming majority elderly vaccinated well large chunk general population; plus number people natural immunity.

In country medical infrastructure United States, likelihood hospitals overwhelmed point incredibly unlikely. convention planning go NOVEMBER cancelled, again. 

Why fuck nothing getting better? Okay, lose easily. “Heartburn” weight also sounds like excuses me. Canadian rate vaccinations

2.6% fully vaccinated

&amp;#x200B;

Mexico rate vaccinations

4.2% fully vaccinated Both. Perfect jeopardy. variant came people thought it’s okay step out. research article makes assumption ""well mixed room"" 

TBH, almost falls category spherical cows vacuum: well-mixed rooms distances matter, cannot imagine condition well-mixed room becomes realistic approximation virus distribution.. fair bit protection could still fairly easily contract covid still. likely protection severe symptoms protection general infection.  dude amazing marketing seems like douche whenever read him. probably not. 

Just another study today suggested 92% efficacy 14 days first dose Pfhizer Moderna. 

Second dose booster prolong immunity lasts 6 months beyond. 

First instantaneous. seem offer almost good protection doses. still give least 2 weeks build body's immune response. Look American government clusterfuck, used 6-8 months acquire vaccines threw money producers make sure would enough, look things now? seeing surge half population least one dose.

It's baffling Europe something similar. American German. mRNA tech developed University Pennsylvania. BioNTech licensed patents. course creating vaccine complicated following that, basic R&amp;D done America. surprising people seem know this. Lol 😂 Americans choose live virus. Polio still eradicated, yet countries mass polio vaccinations. point, pandemic basically over. Yes, NOW, there's isolated cases. simple stupidity, care. simply cold towards suffering strangers.  Opps. apparently infected little bit dumbass. good thing variant serious consequences. child school?  Definitely I'd say gotten worse that. What's problematic currently average people gotten tired whole Covid thing. Even believe virus exists, care anymore. Lots people protesting measures taken Covid. think two things contradictory? Canada--like everyone else developed world--spends far less healthcare citizens live longer lives. worry moving back mom's house broke arm. worry getting evicted purchase insulin. eat Ramen year insurance company cover kid's cancer treatment. go hospital, get treated, get sent way, that's it. unknowable medical bill look forward to. no-brainer whose healthcare system better.

Yes, vaccine rollout better theirs.  always keep forgetting fact… mainly people don’t understand point it’s hard use arguments plus people kept telling “you don’t know numbers real” blah blah… yeah one wave essentially started last September kinda never ended rolled along.

and people getting smarter it. see less less masks, masks nose… it’s dire. Saying Americans deserve die order convince U.S. give immediate foreign aid. Good strategy. ""A COVID-19 vaccine producer that’s based Alberta says ready provide millions doses booster shots necessary approvals granted.

Notes:

* raw data downloaded exact totals every age group downloaded [CDC vaccination demographic trends CSV. CDC indicates data ""Date Administered"", actually appears ""Date Reported"".
* Texas (about 9% US population) excluded CDC demographic data, tables match national totals.
* CDC reports vaccinations 0-17 age group. 16-17 age group calculated using 2019 Census estimates 11.4% aged 0 17 ages 16 17, assuming 0-17 age group doses given ages 16 17. go site click around various states, pretty clear vaccine appointments widely available within 1-3 days changed past days. 19th vaccinations opened everyone 16+, spent lot time site finding appointments kids, week later drive hour, appointments disappeared literally 5-10 minutes. Today ample appointments available miles almost every day.

I sure people can't bothered make appointment need walk-in someone literally come door. lot polls throughout past year showed demand dropped pretty sharply 60% seeing. local cvs offering walk-up shots. one getting Ah. bad. Thanks correction Another issue see rarely adresed US blocked export vaccines itself, also equipment material vital production.

That disrupted supply chains several manufacturing plants proven harmful global vaccination efforts. Yup, legit PM Care Fund website. money gets distributed among different states. Also, getting free vaccine, govt. buys using fund. Hahah way deflect champ Covid known significant anima reservoirs? know bats, seems logical would international determination root infestation near Wuhan out. Otherwise known elsewhere animals? Even bats, wouldn’t need place humans least semi regular interaction animals disease endemic? majority 30% US's population claims uninterested vaccine eventually gets COVID (from contagious strains spreading like wildfire communities herd immunity kicks there) country looking another million'ish deaths.

Except huge overlap people willing get vaccine refuse social distance/wear masks, etc. pretty damn good chance group already gotten it. ok didn’t know Yeah, I’m waiting particular area improve. We’re right start new surge, gyms may closed Friday anyway. get home kettlebells/elliptical/stationary bike little longer. Yeah president thinks people whining.

Nice! feel? I’m expecting first leg day back gonna suck... I'll wait charge actually something. knows finish line mean public.

Some states better number still outdoor mask mandates. Even vaccination requirements place, schools venues still force masks social distancing. Biden's ""100 days masks"" ends Thursday, April 29th seem like talked since January. You’re right bacteria. still elicited immune response . still many pandemics look back still managed live despite lack technological innovation today. Even then, pandemics ended earlier countries others. don’t look far history see case. believe countries get normal others . We’re already seeing Israel. COVID still joke , don’t think it’s worst we’ve ever faced .  also greatly reduced chance spreading virus vaccine. may afraid dying, good, worry infecting others, like family members may immunity issues? piece mind far greater worrying health. got first pfizer shot going second week. 

Better shot covid. many things place prevent ""acting now"". vaccine contracts bought rich countries, countries Africa expected vaccinated 2023 way things going now.

We need put pressure politicians act waive patents COVID vaccinations, vaccine production facilities world start manufacturing necessary vaccines. Vaccine companies already paid billions profits shareholders, they've made enough profit. rate we're going, even Pfizer increased production capacity many many poorer countries could afford vaccines. cases Pfizer selling two dose regimen vaccine $39, 80% profit margin. disgusting profit gouging pandemic, every day goes anyone goes unvaccinated threatens us all. unvaccinated infected person anywhere world could place new, vaccine-resistent variant born. That's like saying advisor president power. reductionist. Yes, can't make policy decisions, influence president's decisions.  Stay safe man Yes US definitely spear headed whole anti-mask/science rhetoric. 

Look groups across world see links whole trump fetishising culture. 

I don’t know it’s happened people know openly anti-mask/anti-vaccine etc etc obsessed American politics can’t name 4 political parties country. tf think are? fuck even know me, I'm doing? Nothing. one fighting war behind PC monitor. Take entitlement somewhere else. Gonna make India self reliant even unscientific?

vaccines 95% effective, meaning 5% still get infected virus spread others.

We debate whether chance worth wearing mask over, point matter science Pretty weak obvious trolling think automoderator's comment spot on. side effects, 2 excedrin every 6 hours staying hydrated sorted out. kind xenophobia lack empathy insane. also voted waiving IP vaccine India could quickly manufacture vaccines factories? performative PR stunt Fuck oath legit

Smart people don’t go around commenting half story... That's dumb take.

Do think anti-mask sentiment *only* America? saying *nobody* else world anti-mask Americans? cool, dont say science not. Oof!

Blowing Moderna water even. many screw ups country get? ""By time hit 80-85% US population vaccinated, means likely might halt virus transmission dramatically reduce virus transmission,"" said Dr. Peter Hotez, dean National School Tropical Medicine Baylor College Medicine. ""And would mean -- think -- people could less get back life like 2019, maybe differences.""

80 85% going hard reach country. two family members already stated never get vaccinated political religious reasons. Wisconsin wide availability vaccine 16+, want vaccine get it. 25% 16-17 yo first shot. Even approved reticence vaccinating younger kids. Adults part protect kids.

Imagine percent vaccinated thermometer visual aids publicized cdc page elsewhere. 

A clear goal might motivating laggards. goal motivating think,

I think one state set numerical goal terms percent vaccinated.

I noted covid related goals coming govt far along lines easily surpassed goals number vaccinations distributed given. better. Modi’s de-population policy really taking  Let's see, 1.4 billion people - 20M vaccines = 1.38 billion people left.

Every bit count obviously life worth saving, 20 millions vaccines really sponge trying stop tsunami here. Probably used Indian government deflect anger population towards them.  3.6 Roentgen. great. terrible. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Canada Mexico need doses, much closer us. Europe needs doses, Latin America needs doses. new variant Dakotas bottom 10 urbanization percentage US. Maybe want argue cities live dense meaningful way than, say, endless LA suburbs still count ""urban"" think burden proof show true Dakotas meaningful way.

I think population density/ urbanization important relevant explanation. think Dakotas fucked things due politicians citizens taking virus seriously. Baader-Meinhof figures estimated undercounted range 5-10x (both cases deaths). India limited testing capacity (positivity rate 20+%), labeling cremation deaths ""sickness"" rather covid. That’s true. can’t compare two vaccines tested different conditions. literally said first reply agreed gaining couple pounds end world? Maybe one reading. said lots exercises without equipment. doesnt mean walking back forth room. Lots bodyweight movements do, possibilities endless bring doorframe, blanket chair (tell know ANYONE without things) didnt even whole year think google ""exercises home""? trying get across possible lose weight small apartment, equipment. wrote said impossible gain weight pandemic, unless flouting covid safety rules. Trying distract making stuff didnt say wont get anywhere. received US government help ways, rather important factor US government guaranteed hundreds millions doses purchase made, means market revenue guaranteed companies. Biden make process lot better, Trump whole program started. There's stopping point. questionable whether external forces could ever reasonably done so. Maybe every vaccine world sent India first, that's practically politically feasible. Wow really think USAs fault. anti american propaganda really worked you. “Look number people infected China” 

How that? official numbers cannot trusted Could keeping second doses? unreliable AZ might wanna keep larger stash around. I'm sure is. college degree...No plans get stabbed anytime soon...

You apply refund degree. husband 33 next Sunday :) Honestly, stuck home way convince stick rowing machine regularly. hope India gets help needs. We've got vaccine birthday 🎉.

One thing found interesting 2 weeks mRNA vaccines risk ~ 80% JnJ vaccine gives ~68% even immune someone got JnJ. fluid situation know sure, better promise deliver promise deliver. Got first Astra Zeneca jab March 3. get second May 26. happy 12 week gap. fair, density matter, rather urbanization matters. said, 2010 (so, fairly dated point), SD ND still bottom-10 urbanization per census, 55% 60% respectively. can't act like personal behaviors matter. imagine we'll find East Asian countries ended faring much better line. obviously India going suffer population density, easier virus spread. statements still mathematically correct time.

Remember, (the US vaccination rollout) never done before. amazing accomplishment, something made happen, something preordained, destined, guaranteed. look many countries around world things could go given slightly different circumstances. Pandemic one top irrational (now rational suppose) fears last year fucking sucked. everything right much could (worked home, masked Publix, socially distances, etc.) finally seeing light end tunnel given huge swell relief (that getting vaccinated). forever-lockdown weirdos really starting annoy me. don’t wanna see friends family again? Cool, choose stand behind choices, don’t force rest us so. mean, it’s risk vaccines planned knowing could happen. scientists researchers gave us best shot that’s left countries supporting getting shots many arms possible. Everything else unknown. forecast end May. Politicians influence CDC, listen guidelines. CDC political mouthpiece. Yup, thinking same. Right......us getting shit together fucked countries.....right. remote possibility, wet dream people enjoy isolation. I'll never understand people background subject enjoy speaking certainty.  Yea, going take reach US per capita, literally billion people US has. Dude, send ventilators stuff. Compared countries health care system still pretty fucking good. Oregon Washington nice drop yesterday week week. Hopefully indicates already peaked out. days data confirm. go without saying. blaming corona deaths obesity intellectually dishonest.  see what's happening next door India? kids die flu get flu shot, parents option getting kids flu shot sending school (which least partially protective probably protective severe disease years). reasonable parent want wait covid vaccination kid, especially yet know long term effects getting covid kid. none those, experience pandemic obviously blinded handful tropey opinions.

And yes, given India's population official numbers always somewhat off. However, based speaking doctors many Indian hospitals clear back Jan-March things getting realllly good, they're really bad One thing add, like 2 3 month ago, BJP rulling party declared president Modi defeated covid India leadership better US Uk etc. Since relaxed everything, big political rallies like 10 days ago sounding alarm. saying seen anything religious rallies less 2 weeks ago worst come. Sorry hear. social responsibility maintain rules reasonable degree (concerts travel essential truly thing people even 100 years ago) governments need adhere orders prevent health care collapse. even talking about?

Also paid favorite breakfast spot visit morning able go year, hole wall place. owner still remembered usual order. cannot get good feels fully vaccinated, absolutely blows mind anyone would turning shots down. think confused quiet Josh, billion dollars! Yeah agree point... government handling could lot better... lot ways...  Restrictions lifted people gathering air-conditioned buildings, time vaccines approved &lt;20% population natural immunity. **Should 90%** instead dozens 4,000+ Honestly, let victory defeat us finishing line. 

For people Covid 2020, making lost time friends family profits business. Masks disappeared, life went back normal vaccine distribution stumbled around. government basically nothing India’s lockdown (its first vaccine procurement happened Jan 2021, year later US, UK, EU), didn’t upgrade health resources import much needed medicine. Governmental incompetence peoples complacency brought us here. vaccination rate US far better india.... reality, frankly believe shutdown travel locations. 

People want go vacation again, amount people seen take seriously insane. I'm vaccinated vacation Puerto Rico, to.get tested, fill form present inspection airport upon arrival. right. 

The videos india heart wretching I'm sympathetic ignore facts. county massive festival without masks last month, weddings events. taking seriously I'm sympathetic that. sympathetic stuck middle can't anything. countries. 

We need lockdown areas higher case count allow movement... Vaccinate shit people. nutshell US loosened restrictions opened little natural immunity. South hot weather pushed people gather indoors. likely see another small surge south summer due indoor season returning lower vaccination rates.  always variants. Covid eliminated like smallpox. can't keep borders closed forever chance variant may evade vaccines. even one did, boosters works. eating indoors restaurants fully vaccinated? ""Double masking"" guidance actually recommended wear respirators, aka N95, alone. wear filtering surgical tight fitting cloth mask improve seal. 

That's misinformation spreading there. ever think might one sigh inducing? case peak autumn mostly impacting fall, hence reference fall surge across sources. 

Here’s another source Michigan dept Health using terminology surge comparison Luckily population India quite young. help curb severity cases little bit. NovaVax released interim efficacy data trials January.  released complete trial data March trials.  countries waiting US Mexico trials complete NovaVax, haven’t released data. What's superior strategy then? Containment? Containment impossible long term enforces quarantine national level, severely hampering economic activity.

How many countries even managed containment anyway? New Zealand? Australia? China? I’m this, curious haven’t helped countries hit super hard? I’m thinking Brazil think others bad South America. Maybe... fair better rural communities. immune systems better 'over reacting' virus causing massive lung issues.  


Or maybe acted like case study last year California?  


I pray them. **MASSACHUSETTS UPDATE**

Second 100k+ dose day weekend, bringing 7 day average again. New Hampshire's 53.7% sits ahead Massachusetts's 53.07% first dose counts, meaning Massachusetts ranks 2nd 50 states first doses total population.

Notes: 

* Pfizer EUA expanded age 12, eligible population increased approximately 6,020,000.
* (- n days) means n days later, away, compared peak 60,522 back 4/14. Nobody expects eradicate virus.

Public health people UK said months ago there's going come point accept certain level deaths hospitalizations COVID vaccines stop get back lives 

That's pandemic ending means. Unless changes lead ADE. Absolutely, way suggesting vaccinating. Also thought level *higher* 1%.  introduces spike protein. test 200,000 pet day average. pretty robust testing system NY second dose AstraZeneca 24 days away can't wait till done. I've felt lot secure since first jab. time jabs eleven weeks, longer gap seems working well enough. Good vaccination program, though compliment government anything else. 3,020,948 administered

94,772,329 fully vaccinated (28.5% total, 36.5% adult)

36,911,819 seniors fully vaccinated (67.5%) That's exactly wondering. modi: ""this internal matter, dont want ventilators"" state's autumn surge

*sigh*

Comparing hospitalization numbers September November peak hospitalizations surge cases December January substantially misleading. Oh absolutely, suggesting vaccine bad taken.  Definitely Oceania. We're way behind vaccinations. Vaccines work variants.

For let's keep way. husband fully vaccinated planning trip daughter beginning June. I’m trying decide whether cancel... think? things open? Curevac going used Europe Ema already started approval process; they’ve analyzing data couple months need final results efficacy. Bullshit Allergies? Resurgent transmission everything else people collectively stop cautious? That's currently would wearing one even expected (allergies) would still plan next cold flu season (everything else suddenly unleashed)

Summer one exception immediate future necessarily wear one without expectation to. spike protein itself. Study study keep telling us spike protein cause problems. exactly side effects vaccine people match symptoms actually getting infected. Thankfully spikes vaccine keep replicating body easily learns fight off. Lots Indian people claiming export controls/embargos products none. products spoken already. Defense Production Act US government giving manufacturers additional funding support produce product US government would available without it. example, adding third shift factory would otherwise unprofitable. Obviously US government purchasing products. also new production facilities constructed DPA, lead times incredibly long. US exporting supplies EU vaccine production.

There's lot potential supply left supply chain. news definitely true, fact it’s actually worse cases deaths reported due lack RT-PCR beds. whatever number seeing news, think it’s easily 5 times sub really became like r/coronavirusUSA US infections started rise last year. fairly global. surprised majority United States' vaccine exports, especially next year, go countries like India, Bangladesh, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos. think current administration going see amazing opportunity humanitarian effort geopolitical motives. think lot go countries like Japan, Taiwan, South Korea well, think United States going make effort big favors countries susceptible Chinese influence. Biden wants allies chance get also right thing. LETS FUCKING GOOOO  also important note end game.

If assume 60-70% people take (what polling mostly shown), 78-88% way done.

The good news seems might enough general sense start drop covid numbers. bad news (for areas) going HUGE gaps areas super high vaccinated areas low. Exactly Well feel silly, also insensitive. Filters big sticking point mRNA vaccines well Pfizer/Moderna figuring reuse cycles let scale manufacturing significantly. It’s also “Make Pfizer give it’s IP countries make it!” Falls deaf ears me. Pfizer Moderna entire world’s supply filters ordered least 1 year now, people could get plasmids replicate RNA plasmid templates, there’s parts simply exist planet outside US/EU’s Manhattan Project-esque build vaccines, you’d end exact situation SII in: Bitching you’re missing parts required manufacture vaccine. Aye, loonies, matter say they'll never believe you. Lmao wtf? course two X chromosomes women. Lol one downvoted comments I've seen reddit. Happy contribute tally! Likely may Yes speaking covid nurse US, short supplies — everyday running around hospital, trying find extra oxygen delivery devices (the hi-flow nasal cannulas oxygen monitors), scrounging whatever could get patients. whole situation awful. 

Luckily, live California, situation become 10000x better help India (so many doctors HCPs come invaluable effort).  Honestly looks like they're speeding pretty nicely, I'm starting believe possible, would make really happy! dad got Pfizer today! mum gets well I'll see without worrying much next weeks Nailed it. 


This moment U.S' regional differences going show. state (California) 47% total population vaccinated. We'll probably hit 60% month two. Mississippi? Probably even hit 50% months months. 


Not sure means restrictions overall, pretty clear COVID winddown going different based are. vaccine manufacturing capacity overstated. world's largest vaccine manufacturing plant (Serum Institute), that's one also exporting thought COVID over, shit hit fan stopped exporting weeks ago. understand people like mass vaccination sites. appointment process? within 40 minutes first dose within 20 minutes second dose. Yeah cover way nose scarf. stupid. imply that. saying expected Indian government fucked up. Yup, feel United States comfortable enough position begin exporting. 60,000,000 doses distributed unused, I'm 100% positive we're going continue grow unused supply even sending materials, hopefully doses soon enough, across planet. Fuenteses, aided financially family member living United States, able buy oxygen tanks, IV drips, saline solution, needles costly supplies, hire nurses provide 24-hour care home. Mexico’s punishing second coronavirus wave January, 50 percent covid-19 patients admitted hospitals run Mexican Social Security Institute, nation’s largest public health network, subsequently died. Cabrera’s grandmother caught virus recovered, began similar treatment motherat home: combination vitamins ibuprofen purchased donations neighbors extended family. surge get behind! Dyson's shit marketing. need over-engineered expensive ventilators. need stuff works. 10 percent got single dose.. fully vaccinated Vaccines work variants. see particular danger flight full people particular country high case rate, moreso flight say Michigan US Ontario Canada, see many people calling end movement places.

Ultimately worth though! US government fucked India's response virus. That's Modi (or, ""Indian Trump"" like think him) team nut jobs.

And Indian manufacturers stopped filling vaccine orders countries back March shit started getting bad, Indian government reserving domestically produced supplies people. Sounds familiar country got hammered virus, no? seriously wait two months respond this?  work fairly crowded hot environment. problem masks staying place while. Everyone else agrees me, means life return otherwise. like everyone social distancing going much, rather masks. turns vaccine causes billion people infertile grow third arm year, gonna crazy. 😅 Here's thing travel bans: really apply citizen exact country. present passport let right citizen. give conditions end day drop rope let in.

Very unlikely. 6 months. need boosters, almost certain *modified* vaccine.

So, no, sane argument stockpiling.. lmao Thanks info, I'll read it. Enjoy drink, friend, stay safe there. leaders hurt you, america. daily rate start drop hit 70% vaccinated.

...where seeing that? dropped 55% Israel. agree; avoid beheadings random car bombs. Rallies held every political party. done Asian countries small population sons college avoid getting sick finals. 

Though may admit now, uncommon see lots masks cold, flu finals season. Ok, must different program directly know people vaccinated end January Seattle Fire Department adult family home. owners home 3 current residents vaccinated.

I've started go grey pandemic. 2019 greys, visibly poking hair.

I'm 23. no, particular program started month, makes sense since stimulus bill biden signed allocated billions create mobile vaccination programs expect company kept Trump's personal Twitter account around liked publicity money? incited actual riot think something. I've used public transport fair bit fine. Since vaccinated, safe others wear mask make sure windows open. precisely angry rihanna greta thunberg. make twitter remove posts they're huge public figures. guess Astra zeneca would happy dumped countries would harm reputation. may letting us contract

Sure, US state publicly ready sell/donate/whatever vaccine. let AZ try take bad PR trying not-to-allow-it.

Contracts renegotiated: either AZ believes vaccine crap go record believe valuable it'd silly try block transfer..

As ""liability"", purchaser/beneficiary would need waive liability too.. went get first shot, hotel conference room. chairs set 15 minute waiting period, big projection screen front said “XXX County - Served 80,000!” thought cute touch (and impressive).

Nothing wrong opinion source legit, good day. see posts yesterday's London's 750k people antilockdown march, lockdowns rhetoric banned here? Supermarket checkouts: ""would like vaccine today?""


Pubs: ""have vaccine pint""


Hairdressers: ""can get magazine vaccination today, madam?"" hard know whats going on? use social media news. implication could people outdoors TX FL, outdoor COVID transmission negligible. probably true, alone enough explain huge disparity. Thanks UK! maybe realists? Typically migraines pretty intense crippling sort way. younger would nauseous needed go dark room sound. blinded sort way hurt much look anything. it’s definitely normal bad headache. It’s far worse. Fortunately haven’t one long time I've seen videos food vendors wash plates pot holes full water.

And made assumption that? I've seen pretty horrible shit western countries too. surge 1-2 weeks max. calm like every else. Average redditor happened aatmanirbhar bharat. Modi made disaster. Twitter makes hard know what's going on.

Try reputable news source. learn they?  Don’t mention “social responsibility” sub, that’s last thing people want hear. It’s f’the others, going want matters (ironically, even actions put person greater risk). old phrase “you can’t fix stupid” never brazenly confirmed. already far concerning variants circulating freely throughout globe. Indian Twitter reporting scarce supplies making covid tests. idea local national issue I'd take pinch salt. could decrease locally may well lack testing, political fuckery anything else. Please stay safe get vaccinated time up. Yes. expecting bigger problem vaccine distribution May later. flu covid nothing alike though, covid-19 far worse totally different flu, mutations far serious. Well, flights india need stopped now, numbers chance mutations got much higher.

If get mutation Europe, vaccines work, start beginning.

But looking handling pandemic Europe too, Im really scared get worse again, gets better... bought additional 26,000 like £570 million. vast majority (90%) unused report released Nov.

They expected ventilators critical turned less useful thought - still crucial certain patients. could build fires without bodies produce smoke try fake it. there's way fake smell many human bodies burning. Anyone radius least mile burn sites going realize fake. parents leery giving new vaccines kids. hpv vaccine comes mind (when new). 

But I’m school thought vaccine pretty safe, get it. I’d rather take chances rare side effect lifetime neurological problems breathing problems day. yet Americans flocking visit! WTF???!! Dying Covid quick pleasant death Interesting, I’m Portland friends got last month without much difficulty. require hunting appts. DC definitely recover faster places. Government gonna gov, mid-20s gonna mid-20s. Az delivering almost nothing, Pfizer realiable partner thought can't get vaccine positive last 2 weeks? would test everyone hope catch right after. seems unlikely considering wave. 100%. Anyone says different lying. gov first responsibility help citizens out...then help others. It’s like airplane safety video...put mask helping others. immune systems weren’t strong, humanity wouldn’t made Bubonic Plague.

The plague virus, bacteria. beat becoming hygienic creation antibiotics. Vaccines effective it.

I think actually, shocking despite far come medically years Covid still deadly is. think many people overlook actual fact. ability intubate use supplemental oxygen death toll would astronomical. sure downvoted, legitimate question within given reality in? Sometimes feel like people sub want live fantasy world ignore reality situation. reality really know vaccines really stand variants, we're learning now. think people thinking variance oh like flu variant, virus flu though, think care far mutating, flu mutates. read flights India. Someone could travel India anywhere else, Canada. Definitely get new dentist. wouldn’t trust medical opinion that. U.S.’ restrictions [**export key raw materials manufacture COVID-19 threatens slow India’s vaccination drive, senior State Department official said Biden administration’s first obligation take care requirements American people.  asked Biden administration would decide India’s request lift ban export vaccine raw materials, State Department spokesperson Ned Price said: “...the United States first foremost engaged ambitious effective and, far, successful effort vaccinate American people.”  campaign well underway, we’re couple reasons. Number one, special responsibility American people. Number two, American people, country hit harder country around world – 550,000 deaths, tens millions infections country alone,” said Thursday.  U.S. interest see Americans vaccinated; interests rest world see Americans vaccinated, said.  point Secretary (of State Antony Blinken) made repeatedly long virus spreading anywhere, threat people everywhere. long virus spreading uncontrolled country, mutate travel beyond borders. That, turn, poses threat well beyond United States,” Mr. Price said responses questions.  rest world, “We will, course, always much can, consistent first obligation,” said.  

As American, personally know look decreasing demand + AZ authorized justify either raw materials prioritization AZ stockpile. curiosity - expand think tx population distribution differs Michigan? assume implying Texas less urban. that’s case - I’m sure that’s really accurate. many people talking India needs based tweets read makes really hard know what’s going on. Full herd immunity probably unrealistic, also necessary. could variants escape protection transmission protection severe disease. Interestingly enough, WH press release explicitly calls support Covishield (AZ License) Novavax (which export, since yet approved India). comes website named “Science Based Medicine.” That’s exactly thing deniers hate, doubt good. taking small portion people assuming entire country like that. 

Use brain. soooooooo works. Nobody’s making vaccines “recipes”. Vaccines made fast many facilities. Vaccine companies large sharing working together, making companies vaccines facilitates. plan win win them. tapping pandemic frustration inundate school boards bunch different concerns putting state analysis paralysis preventing taking steps need thereby frustrating parents further. school board distracted able effective keeping schools safe. GOP use push school choice vouchers private schools.

It added bonus upsetting teachers union leads higher likelihood strike. often aligns people unions causes direct inconvenience voters life. Usually viruses adapt less lethal fight them. starts getting kids sick adults, would put pressure covid evolutionarily keeping home vaccinating then. hope vaccine get routinely 12 vaccinate younger get herd immunity. US much better condition. end unlikely. Large amount unvaccinated people problem. Covid circulate among possible mutates vaccines less effective.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Great! Yes, outrage. Hope help fight covid. Nice ad hominen. 

That's real manchild attitude. 

I personnally stay inside much. I've seeing family lot lately, due humanistic economic concerns/activities. I'm good citizens eyes government lately, right, they're good government eyes. Florida one highest test positivity rates nation. Many Texas’ big cities/counties restrictions own.

Michigan obviously cannot compared directly Florida, Texas, state, different climate (see: UV index time year), population distribution, etc.. Frustrating, also, looks like US made AstraZeneca vaccine caught Emergent BioSolutions Fiasco. Dude, 40 people living together : Poverty fault.
Who's fault one asshole family said ""Nah covid gone. pricks sitting home. Come need fresh air""

I know although extended family live separate houses, heard except us decided eat outside, visit place worship even go theatre !!. Pathetic irrelevant topic send excess supply, India really wants raw materials needs manufacture supply -- far we've turned down. claim define actually calculating herd immunity target 70% inoculation. Herd immunity requires broad immunity infection, disease.

I really wish politicians would stop lying science here. claim huge victory 70% vaccination protection disease less 2 years pandemic began. Making herd immunity targets follow scientific calculation herd immunity completely unnecessary risks people losing even faith leadership virus continues spread fall winter. depressing many willing to, make pandemic drag on. 8 months generous.. True were. chose compare see fit here. example France country technically also State. Probably none comparisons would entirely point. little bit both! Demand definitely decreasing I've also noticed amount CVS stores carrying vaccine doubled last couple days. Well, get vaccinated think it’s time get rid too. mean enough already, someone got end eventually actually referring covid response, talking business practices never deliver promises. 

Thanks compliment, seem like really happy secure person! /s even know whether South Africa strain causes pandemic levels severe disease people vaccinated AstraZeneca vaccine? Seems unlikely due cellular immunity. CDC gives guidance states follow T, see Illinois. Well, thank fucking god. need vaccines Oxygen get right now. Great move US. Guess Biden act countries interests support elections. “It’s course interest see Americans vaccinated,” Mr. Price went say. “It’s interests rest world see Americans vaccinated.”

tell reservations - mainly bc sizes samples groups small trials medical history me. getting covid wouldn’t better terms either it’s probable yes. 

My 13 yo want get it. 

I think removed masks distancing vaccinated ppl would convincing. messaging continues nothing changes anyone it’s really inspiring young ppl get vaccine. Elon Musk: "" coronavirus panic dumb reference /s entire world seen horrible management governments including called advanced nations.

If anything positive add here, take random trip somewhere else. good question. think correct, CDC announcing information want people skipping 2nd shots. mean hey sounds good, **especially** protective equipment frontline workers since deserve nothing best right now. US literally sending raw materials making Covishield India

Maybe read speak. can't convinced decades vaccinate polio every country except one eliminated, they're probably lost cause COVID-19 vaccines. sucks, might better close borders decide otherwise. direct result throwing caution wind, things got dire case numbers scared straight, people went back inside.

why dead bodies streets Texas Florida?

Texas full capacity 10,000+ people baseball games masks....their numbers still going Amateurs shipment flying UK according BBC. wonder many ventilators actually ended big push last year Fantastic news! imagine could arrive Delhi and/other hotspots soon? think few, it’s “lockdown” dream world, it’s also enjoy lauded “sacrificing” stuff already didn’t anyways... well enjoying lockdowns sort divine punishment extroverts, really anyone else friends, families, normal social life. boss anything like mine he’s sitting beach working, preaching safe office. Thanking us coming essential employees even nice enough send pen company logo say thanks. get list tweets removed?  one report test positivity rate 50%. western country seen anything much north 10%. way even extrapolate bad situation really is.

At point strict lockdown way change trajectory bitter government steering opposite direction. hopefully calms people hysterical mutants ending humanity. someone never headaches/migraines really wouldn’t know kids 16 18 first shots. Mild side effects one, none (Pfizer). moment shots available 10 places within 5 miles me. would say vaccination program success.

If authorize existing vaccines age 12-16 within weeks I've seen reported, see reason kids vaccinated quickly.  Well India asking, Twitter isn’t complying simple search shows ton angry citizens. Why?  Please stop spreading misinformation. Hesperian publishes *Where dentist* handle dental care rural get upset end. keep mind folks places like US pandemic first time entire people impacted something. Even wars past, 9/11, events may touched us emotionally intellectually, really dramatically affect majority population like COVID has.

There collective trauma take time unwind from, anxiety prone leave scars many many years.

When solid length time COVID news, COVID restrictions, everyone else around going normal lives, majority ""I'll never X Z, even I've vaccinated!"" crowd wear relent. Eventually they'll forget mask one day store, they'll go anyway panic attack fade. Same. little sore everywhere, much better first one me. 18 hours mean like UK, are, longer lockdown, phased rollback restrictions, given timeline this.

These nutjobs, people anti-vaccine, think masks required circumstances ever, fully believe restrictions point never justified even height deaths. Could link here? ""duplicate posts"" rule apply discussion thread. course do! it’s sad media - vaping scary enough clickbait Covid done? Perhaps reduce confusion catches on. news (Canada). got Zoom school board screaming matches football cancelled. 

Fun times. Lots study, much daycare K-12 showing transmission schools fairly rare. Per CDC: bit besides point making though. Vaccinating children protect adults vulnerable makes little sense adults vulnerable already vaccinated.

The relevant metric becomes risk adverse outcome covid vs. Adverse outcome vaccination two become least comparable get Children. Israel decided vaccinate children 12 reasons, that's perfectly reasonable. issue confusion Hydrocloroquine help directly. works medicine increasing body’s cells uptake absorb zinc. don’t take supplemental zinc won’t see benefit described article. people saying already got COVID it’s fine, don’t need vaccine. 
There two-dose regime reason. Long term protection guaranteed without it. Apparently numbers severely underreported, chances much much higher  work company produces COVID test kits product isn’t selling all. close 30 - 50 million test kits sitting don’t get rid soon thrown away. 2% NY? So, chances covid then. kills lot income traffic etc. you’re asking layoff bunch people want walk away money. people get hurt people low rungs. Higher ups would keep jobs. pandemic ain't dead US yet, given terminal diagnosis.

No longer matter ""if?"" matter ""how many weeks left?"" Dammit I'm half vaccinated, I'm sorry never happened Johnson &amp; Johnson one dose vaccines ramp up, it’ll much easier fully vaccinate people.  Also comments data spread traced gym comes owner largest gym chain. It’s within financial interest say gym 100% safe. follow laws even ones don’t agree with. many issues Twitter don’t get decide laws follow don’t.  Lots logistics issues bottle neck. typical cylinder hold 5 kg oxygen filling 300,000 per day simple, especially steel factories never designed high capacity manifolds supply hospitals. Also transportation challenges India’s roads rather slow. 

Glad able provide bit help, pandemic big India adequately deal with. country hasn’t able solve far easier deal diseases malaria TB, things unheard modernized nations. cult. People support trump cult, told hoax / like flu / masks stupid. Even recording came admitting covid dangerous, care. *still* believe Biden election. Time time read former denier got sick changed mind, even die insisting it. Combine ""it happen Me"" attitude people have, are. beyond bizarre. I've also never anyone actually explain wearing mask curtails freedom. boils ""I wanna."" story true, every single person planet deserves read it. would need vaccines sterilize people? let COVID run rampant goal population reduction. gotta keep ‘em vaccinated. reductive wrong don’t disagree that. India’s handling crisis poor start got worse time went on. Regardless, share common bond member human race. able help, I’d like see us all. Lahore mot far drive many Indians makes exceptionally porous Canada actually instituted rule Pakistan originating flights too. simply aren’t many flights coming Bangladesh. Also Bangladesh already talks completely shut border India- people livid government isn’t moving swift enough. China mostly landform border exactly easy traverse Himalayas. worries! trying ease fears. It’s okay know everything. Start talking things outside medicine finance don’t know much. unjust? county, laws. look far people supporting government taking foreign media critical country. 

Part liberal allowing people want local government. concept free speech own, theirs. producing vaccines administer, situation control, humanitarian issue anti export policy resulting collapse india countries vaccine contracts fulfilled. Article February small survey taken December early January. Many circumstances changed since then, making article's conclusions date.  Canadians shitting America claiming Canada much better (nationalism), outraged Americans aren’t fucking people help supposedly much better Canadians. 

Yeah, irony, exactly. Agreed. equivalent saying “My friend got COVID vaccine next day got rear ended.” mildly educated, even well educated showing appalling behavior. seems education necessarily pre-cursor common sense human behavior.   You’re missing point. It’s “bad guys”, it’s weren’t ever “good guys” think were. Americans tend misunderstand role world benevolent force, rather than
fundamentally destabilising. happy get like million doses vaccines Germany. numbers even going make dent country billion people. 0.005% chance therefore miniscule. thing COVID changes much vaccines can't anything, stands reasonable chance falling apart able replicate. can’t. gave away oxygen mask passed out. Well antivaxxers send they're needed boosters due irony american blasting anyone nationalism absurd Ping Pong shows wait  bs make look nice patents lifted, India proposing months. more, developed countries cause death destruction developing world, albeit indirectly. actions? family white English, mum grew India 50's early 60's we've following story avidly getting lot coverage here. scenes coming absolutely heartbreaking. Like I've pumped vaccine rollout happens country still deep ties truly horrifying. Hopefully part unified effort behalf world get this. People evenly distributed geographically though. I'd expect northeast west coast problem reaching herd immunity. looks like southeast going continued community transmission while. could pay reparations Romans, Vikings Norman's give us. China close borders, implement mandatory, state-administered 14-day quarantine. That's good border closure.

I think travel bubble Vietnam, that's it.  According Bloomberg, EU vaccinating average US. It’s less per capita weeks ago EU vaccinating less million per day. ever wear mask? Sure. seen Dr Fauci pundits TV?  Vaccinated? Wear mask, social distance, stay home... Death rate flu nonexistent year Covid still killing people. sad see going India COVID right now. Glad see countries sending help. Meanwhile, US twiddling thumbs saying assistance coming soon. yet designate assistance be. SMH. Crap, adding 18+ percentage overall population. bad... using it? Apparently contractual obligations prevent sending abroad, however begs question aren’t seeing optics politicians working solution. Twitterverse going like this. life saved, even sea deaths, still life saved. went saved single life today, feel like valuable accomplishment? believe. Here's another post mentions tweets Kids least infected part stayed home. vaccine doesn’t help it’s approved children age 16. Took long enough Serum Institute, India's biggest vaccine manufacturer making brand version AstraZeneca vaccine called Covishield... Yeah 5800+ infections 76+ million vaccinations rightfully setting alarm bells...🙄 Well, could help prevent diseases, you’re flat wrong. People countries wearing masks public long covid. Vaccines widely available year. Read article God hope. Supposed get married fall seeing guests can't order drinks bar, together dance floor makes roll eyes hard. I'm taking safe precautions (we'll requiring guests either show proof vaccination negative PCR test), stuff Cuomo enacting based science downright ridiculous. Rural, young, mass public transport (don't believe subway Africa ?), generally low skilled outdoor jobs, little air conditioned office goers. Send JJ vaccines since us government witch hunt get market. I'm assuming 40% US refuse vaccine prevalence misinformation certain circles. means we're going version ""this"" forever. fucking frustrating. Could bother source? I'm curious last reading Fall/Winter certain studies throwing numbers like 25% college athletes given cluster ending myocarditis. assumed real number, reflection lack data - I'm curious see landed data. did. social anxiety. Google is. sure vaccines tested common variants? I've seen fair amount data past month two regarding efficacy various vaccines different variants, especially b117 p.1. is, regardless opinion. Ok cool, realize barely edging pandemic issues, three months ago US crisis states edging back up. NONE us home free. also need ensure safety, glad position send help, can’t send everything have.  ""restricted restrictions"" Ok, then. Asymptomatic spread fully vaccinated person? isn’t really something need worry about. 

Even symptomatic breakthrough infection astoundingly rare. Like, getting-struck-by-lightning rare. drop ocean yes, already today Saudi, USA, UK, Germany others begun sending stuff many nations expected same. together it'll huge help! read article? Particularly last paragraphs? guy writing neurotypical. Yeah, he’s really get us. evil devious - know better, nice try Fauci. also went gym coughing “joking” spreading it. boss stepped in, infected one main responsibility.

100% Idk man. COVID affects breathing, India massive air pollution. may affected heavily virus however become carriers infect families. That's issues arise UK too, right? mean connection % vaccinated drop cases. would redditors know athletes? No, 25% total adult population. amount currently eligible much smaller. read trial data, lot people reported side effects got placebo instead vaccine, 10%-20% side effect. 

Pfizer, see page see page wifes family seen son two years happy see Yep. 300k earlier today, ~50k yesterday. Good know, thanks clearing up. made Delhi yet great know wont issue least follow slew public health professors days, many recommending following British strategy deferring second shot people get first shot. get something like 80% protection first shot. 

Long term immunity known years well, need long term studies that. alarmed declining antibodies like. Antibody levels supposed decline. immune system memory quickly mount effective response. $1 says 5 years say one shot enough along least people. 

Don't get wrong. Everyone family either already 2 shots get 2 shots. people deferring second shot even top 10 behaviors worry public health. mainly live UK what’s thoughts festivals going ahead year ? think still happen ? Holland/ Austria September. Get jabbing, Europe!  afraid novel virus could potentially kill isnt “social anxiety” lol also got remember quarter US fully vaccinated, 42% received least one dose. compared 8% single dose India.

Also silver lining recent Covid surge, hardest hit places (think Dakotas) cases bottomed out, perhaps due herd immunity, even widespread vaccine rollout.

Yes good idea let guard down, different place compared India. Great news. Fingers crossed smooth sailing, lovely gesture SA Gee, wonder would be? Hmmm, mean media scaring living shit people year wouldn’t anything it, couldn’t all. Seems like cereal box science Going WELL ACKTUALLY bare minimum exercise peak Reddit moment.  hear you. Im biracial (am mix white English German) stepmum stepbrother sister British Indians (2nd 3rd generation respectively.) happening India hitting hard, given know still relatives there, well many friends mine, grown mixed area London large south Asian populations. I've India loved spirit many people there, breaks heart see happening. I'm glad getting coverage UK - live anymore presumed it'd news, given longstanding connection UK India. hope yours, whether UK, India elsewhere, keeping harm's way thing begin get better India. help abroad including UK, Germany, Saudi Arabia, USA etc hopefully ease burden. Read article... I'm looking Canada's numbers see three clear peaks April 2020, December 2020 April 2021. worried about? I'm same. I'd still hesitant going packed concert club though. time I'm vaccinated, practically everyone else too. mRNA vaccines produce spikes RGD (arginine-glycine-aspartate) sequence receptor-binding domain spike protein. That's first paper concerned about. 

Further, S1 subunit contains receptor-binding domain engages host cell receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 S2 subunit mediates fusion viral host cell membranes. mRNA vaccine codes too.

My hypothesis spike causing problems people. Therefore paper included. India must enact strict lockdowns. blood Modi's hands. Pfantabulous 32 million cases US. CDC says number unreported cases approximately 4.2xs that. That's 134 million cases US Hope right man I'm really verge losing temper... Follow get it! need understand one case millions vaccinated people isn’t norm long shot. 

This really taken well vaccines really work, seems like would really hard time full blown infection. every day citizens? nothing. 

It mean health officials deal localized breaks spike die (and hopefully cause local spike vaccines).

It look like happened measles years ago, although bigger scale.  article: socially anxious people socially anxious. 
Big. Whoop. Gonna get 1st Pfizer shot next friday, hopefully wont hurt getting never vaccine Yep, higher vaccine manufacturing capacity China, bottlenecked lack raw materials, make fraction China making.

Many Indians blaming US export controls (that also affect China) Americans saying India's fault building much capacity without way get access raw materials first place. % population. matters comes population protection. % adults really useful statistic noise. Zero covid unattainable, we're hoping something close herd immunity. Doesn’t US shit ton unused Ventilators? send well? That's happens people vote religion  enforceable though? many say they've vaccinated, wear them?  ♪♫♬ Life unfair. huge Indian community UK nicest people I've ever met. Many family friends still living India good see UK government stepping helping.  want see science. Thought would interesting. ""raw materials"" thing vaccine manufacturing also supply constrained US. seems foolish shut mRNA vaccine production another place make inactivated vaccines.

The shut emergent facility likely freed availability supplies time send India though.

However US needs change allocation strategy start sending vaccines states still demand, there's still 1/5 eligible population want vaccine can't get yet live supply constrained states. could get done 1-2 weeks accept ""hesitant"" regions going suddenly start using supply take time convince people.

Meanwhile stockpiled astra doses useless us. I'm extremely frustrated sending needed. need them. don't. Since government hellbent witch hunt JJ vaccine, ship India would love it. Test positivity rate 50%, 50% people. NJ hit 50 percent, seems like drop demand leveled day two hope maintains don’t see big drops suspect unfortunately. US wants vaccinate 6-month-olds give people annual boosters. We’re starting conversations states whether it’s safe outside unmasked. think unfortunately may long way go real exit strategy. hope wrong that, though. ridiculous setting reduced limits access parks forests. can't stay distanced miles trails? details UK Government sending India (quoting Following discussions Indian ministers, UK sending first shipment supplies Sunday - due arrive New Delhi early hours Tuesday - shipments total, nine airline container loads supplies - including 495 oxygen concentrators, 120 non-invasive ventilators 20 manual ventilators - sent India UK week. really. I’ve fully vaccinated several weeks now, gym still closed, work still essential personnel site businesses city still operating lot restrictions. 

For better worse, us going communities it. Regarding toilets, didn’t India PR campaign areas get people stop shitting woods? unprovable, thus untrue. serious question? said want spend free time children people care life instead spending time filling social obligations people don’t care think sign disorder? seems things way things calibrated far towards obligations (and driving consumerist behavior always going out). say point masking made difference? simply can't make kind inference based case data states. data fuzzy is, mandates 100% government overreach. back this. Governors unilaterally implemented mandates, think they've caused harm, people think they're kind shield. Literally completely different. Invent refridgerator unlocked riding exercise bike hard 5 minutes time. mean like UK, are, longer lockdown

What? isn’t full reopening meet outside sit beer garden we’re visit pub, restaurants still takeaway only. 

So no, aren’t lockdown, we’re still restricted virus 99% survival rate 14 months I’ve known 2 positives. Yeah pretty soon may expect hear children hospitals, numbers - much else infect students won’t vaccinated, either. They’re resistant much I’m worried. know person said cow urine linked health department . person health department come forward support . small time ministers States central many cases . thing cow urine extract urea . new strain also much faster spread strains well . dilema loosing election life know election wins 5years right Yeah especially given chunk populations mindset towards pandemic, people forget January hitting 250k-300k+ cases *daily* . can’t get complacent we’ve *started* see light end tunnel.  got first Moderna shot 2 days ago still feel like complete garbage. shot really kicked butt. knows that's pretty silly way organize solution problem that's do. really want crowds people coming looking vaccine closing time, infection risk simple practicalities. kind waiting list much better. country vaccinates police firemen healthcare workers otherwise eligible extras. would expect something similar Czech Republic.

Also note many extras - thaw huge amounts see much use, calculate much need day we're talking half box something. Thanks, seems like legitimate problem. conscious trying help within circles. Even then, people left need proactive outreach programs help overcome barriers.  done waaaaaay North America. One biggest drivers ignorance/spread little consequences perpetrators. Good. Unfortunately, problem deeper lack scientific understanding public trust communities, take long time change. live one areas, definitely important talk people one one, see structural changes effect. Focus long term changes supporting public education holding political figures account. don’t reach herd immunity variants keep spreading mutating. Women also autoimmune disorders. Strong immune system backfire. Well known fact. Next. Tbh, could copy paste Panama people would agree thing.

The difference approved vaccines, moot point since far we're bringing yet. Fun fact, guys starting vaccine program weeks earlier us huge scandal lol.

Sometimes question pop r/Panama going on, we're illusion suddenly became better people. We're kinda mystified sudden drop numbers. 

Could variants? government specifically ordered people Southamerica minimum 5 days quarantine even result test negative. takes 6 weeks vaccine fully effective. Thats really slow this, increasing vaccinations helpful road though, assuming effective new varriant. Lack toilets rural problem(rural villages tens thousands of)

What fellow Indian said super well put, government got complacent decided relax checks kept place

They held rallies allows kumbh mela take place event involves one world's largest gathering people. vaccination system irregular general citizens educated stopped caring. Lotta doses work big company Europe team India. I'm talking 8-9 coworkers. Every day, someone calling sick confirmed infected. Right now, half team sick leave. horrifying heartbreaking hear talk situation meetings... want even mild covid. Random scary complications popping people mold asymptomatic covid. Also, would give covid chance spread mutate.

We've told 95% almost year, 85% now? Yeah people shouldn’t assume won’t get year. Funny thing Poland thing TV, program TVP public tv supports government. last week interview specialist doctors. live premiere, negative feedback leading party politics public TV criticize handling COVID situation. removed program TV XD. don’t like people informed someone criticizing them, especially media unofficially side probably strain included vax - happens.  high, Mumbai ranks top 10 world. real issue vast number people Mumbai/India vs. places. means lot sick, hospital system  Tell way prevent happening many people possible vaccinated. likely approved use.

Not really. issues AZ vaccines - blood clots mainly, dead sure used.

Our govt run bunch egoistic illiterates we're mad US. entirely fault govt see second wave coming.

My point rather simple one. want something last year, sent you, need return favour we're told, nope, sorry.

Anyway, let's hope better sense prevails over. Good day Yup  Yes asthma dentist crazy person. There’s way could diagnose Covid jaw pain currently home-bound due knee injury, yeah. Tables turn fast.  Why? accept many things normal way invasive freedom self respect refuse something protect us all? Fuck say. Couldn’t hurt try! Worst say I'm confused. legend map show colors.. legend there's dark green black lowest numbers map seems yellow color. independent allowed here? What? think I'm regular amount vaccinated shouldn’t, one shot still pretty effective. please, people, get shots Same. I'm made fun everyone area husband's family like anymore let come hold baby inside unmasked went church 3k people, followed Sunday Brin h Applebee's 50-100 people. Meanwhile ~~the American government~~ PM Modi Homer disappearing bush links sure. 

Some caricatures, jokes, anti-Govt memes. similar type shared top post yesterday r/India still despite Reddit also Geo-blocking certain NSFW subs Indian IPs years now. Dictatorship priorities Czech rep. that's Mumbai/Maharashtra, Delhi/ Uttar Pradesh Kolkata/West Bengal reporting severe, healthcare capacity exceeding epidemics.

Much initial spike coming Maharashtra reports one imagine high numbers true national epidemic India are. country in? Yes long question. Apparently protection long lasting one does. 4 months much? Surely objection lockdowns pandemic addressed voluntary measures mask-wearing social distancing. Hence, demonstrating exemplary adherence measures, right? Right? likely approved use. enough vaccines yet promised vaccines delivered vaccines, ruined batch illustrates. 

""We exported 44% vaccines""
And that's working well you. Perhaps take government.

""the least block raw materials need make vaccines""
We're ""blocking"" them, we're *using them*. got downvoted making baseless claim. Cases deaths going US. Nearly half population least one dose covid vaccine. People Florida causing ""severe harm"" rest country simply ""being out"". work teens lot quarantining recent exposures yet cases trended down. think overall yet back teens. CVS giving vaccines really easy sign for. Like really easy. kids experiencing severe sickness death COVID large numbers, would know. wouldn’t need government tell you. media would it. Fetuses people, ""but &lt;insert argument. would completely ridiculous continue every flu season. sick, wear mask, things literally never go back normal otherwise. Notty Botties, love ice cream cones! actually deal fair amount Czechs work least amongst ones interact still refer Czech Republic. least English anyways. Theres even certain people know refusing get vaccine belive India going breed variant make vaccines useless we're going back March 2020 month. Tennessee 34% population one shot already slowing down. dont know reach 50% here. 70% estimate useless large regions nation. Afghanistan central Asia 25% fully vaxxed, far 70-80% herd immunity requirements, declaring victory oversupply. it’s easier get flu shot take chance wild. flu sucks, it’s like people get every year. I’ve flu three times 36 years planet, it’s worth wearing mask over. Never say never, look happened Vietnam Well knew afghanistan mountainous, know much snow mountains. know much Middle East beautiful, know much snow mountains.   like 1000 AD 1945. self-hatred point US deployed Afghanistan 20 years, fact.


If want improve country, critique using facts.

Self hatred based emotions, facts. CVS gives second shots people need them. swear recall first saving slums around major cities cases, mostly middle class affected. Guess maybe true all. Curious hear anyone experience going vaccinatiom centers closing hours asking spare dose would thrown out. Thinking affraid response. I'm 34 AZ jab yesterday suffering side effects today. like 5-10% bad Covid last year. Unpleasant, extent see people comment it, nowhere bad covid was. think India get extra Pfizer Moderna doses need, really need right now.  people research judging country, seems many people think certain regions/countries world barren ugly wastelands. I'm glad learned something today! guys going use AZ, ship countries need? 3 vaccines working well. India exported vaccine made countries started vaccinating people domestically. 

We exported 44% vaccines, done 0. Sure ""America first"" whatever, least block raw materials need make vaccines, ship vaccines need. many countries same!

Here graph -  Eh j&amp;j great communities kind resources larger ones, also great servicing rural Americans. apposed AZ likely never used u.s fuck “critical thinker”? Apparently duplicate post, never saw post anywhere I'm sure. MeToo JnJ one too.  I'll stick pfizer/moderna. US can't legally take down. said whole worlds Covid could fit coke can. basically easy intentional release onto unsuspecting public People put something bodies false beliefs. want blocked prosecuted. crazy thing is, assuming two-shot vaccine, it'll vaccinate 1% population.

India LOT people.  philippines says hi One dose still offers 80% protection frankly matter. incompetent useless PM using PR stunt he's waiting election results magically government help 4 5x us numbers

Conservative estimate weird feeling chest lingering days otherwise none. Going 2nd shot Monday. Hope doesn’t happen ‘Nearing’ approval.  haven’t even started stage 3 trials Immunity certificates?? Stop fear mongering. vaccines work 6+ months shown effective variants. always continue booster shot way it. biggest challenge vaccine uptake. wonderland sub! Imported cases? considered airborne long time that's why, still confirmed even recently. Conveniently left part of. Conspiracy nuts really find anything. Except 10s millions women - many cases never - birth control also experiencing side effects. means India betting natural herd immunity! Classic boomers calling solidarity, unless show it. thought cremating tens hundreds thousands people open using stick fires fuckin horrifying. shit messed up. Indian government putting lot effort image saving PR actually save lives. lot people died outside hospitals due lack icu's oxygen cylinders. seems like situation getting worse. Everyone worried new strain causing havoc lot Indians travelled around world fair country lockdown/trace effective China. Maybe Vietnam minor neighbor.

You however 100% blame unnecessary religious political gatherings. India worst covid doubt it’s really sad even possible different? Seems like you’re born minutes ago Yep it’s I’m censorship  Indian government using censorship cover mistakes? China, feeling media would quickly accuse human rights abuse, etc... None here. Almost like double standards. girl complete fucking idiot; works hospital, never wears mask, always wining dining.

I'm happy offered something drink yesterday, declined.

Here's hoping vaccine job. TIL Czechia = Czech Republic units located major public private sector steel plants supplying around 1,500 metric tonnes medical oxygen per day across country, per data Ministry Steel

This first positive news India. people drove hundreds miles get first dose. data second dose necessarily exactly 3 weeks, possible people wait convenient get second dose take work go appointment drive way way get shot. course people bother, could definitely factor. army completely mobilized, setting field tents city roads, airlifting oxygen oxygen machines, full lockdown?

What hell?

This needs immediate attention entire country resources.

Why feel half-assed small trucks back forth rusted oxygen cylinders entire country fire? India's limited testing capacity. Nobody knew real number now. Pfizer's CEO saying 12 months. manufacturing capacity stockpile boosters export solid amount point, neither Republicans Democrats want seen providing vaccines countries demand met US. government collapse pandemic? movie people storm parliament remove PM. Covid could cause people explode street half world would still deny existed/mattered. really varies depending live victims weaponized disinformation hostile nation state? heard story NPR somewhere back. commented lot downtown DC various lobbyist firms offices government related businesses. pandemic found lot work remotely without cost expensive office space DC they've either gone fully remote moved cheaper offices outside capitol plan drive/commute downtown need meet government officials. also said businesses downtown means lot shops, restaurants, etc.... also exist provide services businesses businesses gone clientele gone well many went business. Even carryout models work one actually lives near restaurant. Exactly this. We’re still learning long term effects Covid, don’t even know attacks body strange ways, hey, kid fine!!!! Nope,  Maybe like pedophile US got now. Czechia ordered ~95+% Pfizer/BioNTech doses (~87% first order), ~72% Moderna, ~42% AZ J&amp;J, ~18% Curevac 100% Novavax. ordering cheap doses, ordering doses. going traveling Missouri Massachusetts take advantage “loosened restrictions”? [The 7-day avg cases US fallen 11.6k (17%) since last close. first part country get hit hard usually first get better Covid waves, take long time rest country get better. US’ third wave cases peaked Dakotas mid-November took early January peaked country overall. Brazil’s second wave Manaus suffered January, took late March infections Brazil whole peak. 

Since Mumbai started seeing declining cases 2 weeks ago may unfortunately take long time infections India whole peak. Actually, that's pretty much exactly average (median) EU+EFTA. Source: agree links studies data would made article better.

That said, two points keep mind here:

1. need young(ish) people know they're safe COVID. article makes clear. oversimplifies, completely right fact hospitalizations among young people increasing, point ICU capacity may become limiting factor. Dying many people also dying taken life-saving equipment really foolish way go.

2. data very, easy find. googled ""Michigan COVID hospitalizations age"" got [Michigan.gov's official see latest slide deck, hospitalizations among age 18-59 group lot. lot lot. Around 500% more. cases increasing, hospitalizations increasing. Young people might better old people COVID, they're still getting sick enough overwhelm hospitals.

So there's messaging question think about, here. want people know? think want people know young people ending hospitals COVID, need shake ideas youth-based immunity. think want people know find information. (And agree NYT article could quantitative this.)

Because COVID-19 detected urine stool samples, public restrooms cause concern. Researchers measured droplets generated flushing toilet urinal public restroom found substantial increase measured aerosol levels ambient environment total number droplets generated flushing test ranging tens thousands. Due small size, droplets remain suspended long time.  80% vaccination rate much quicker uptake age group. 18-39 Yeah, remember easy summer last year? Even AC season tiny wave. real test US come fall. I’m ordering get vaccine, stop wasting time. Don’t want attention. people even countries states low overall population density still live close metropolitan areas. Half people live Dakotas couple cities. US going help first help world. always US, UK, Canada come save everyone else. Meanwhile Twitter sjw shit western countries. 

India never going get poverty current cultural religious beliefs traditions. beliefs traditions India almost illogical handle destroy hope innovation development. US state reasoning apparently decided people drinking night would huge vector. Humans bros. &amp; sisters.  Giving everyone booster shot twice year hardly challenge. use infrastructure flu shots build that. take effort? Yes course, it. Anyone hear update ages 12-15 Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine EUA approved US? Here’s attention ordered Oh god tell that! second one June, middle 4 shifts would anyone hate you? Go live life. developed nation go landfill.

Undeveloped nations - yep, good chance makes way ocean.  sure can, fuck anti-vaxxers I’m US. I’m confident... WAY many uneducated ppl believe everything &amp; anything science. Bc GOD Yeah usual stuff fair. mrs early 30s wiped couple days. bad still pretty savage 2nd dose too. Hard keep AZ. Ireland originally expecting 160k 30th April. Earlier week delayed 3rd May. Then, Friday, delivery apparently back 30th April. And, true cancelled/delayed again.

Jesus company shambles guess relevant comparisons. mean... article say, astrazeneca vaccine waiting coming India, surprise shipment canceled. Starting next week EU see large increases Pfizer, Moderna AstraZeneca. Pfizer wil increase 70%, Moderna basically double AstraZeneca also decent increase. J&amp;J seems track increasing doses every delivery. think perhaps get point certain countries difficulties administering doses. Vaccines effect virus mutates, may indirectly make resistant strain widespread vulnerable population. think mutations work way around current vaccines nulify efforts far? Vaccines work well far, maybe combo mutated strains could make vaccines less efficient, useless, people suffer minor flu like symptoms instead catching all, protection serious problems still there. Plus new mutant emerges, takes months widespread country origin (for example british variant first detected september, 70% contagious, took 2-3 months make problems Britain, 6 months till made problems Europe USA places), even right todaya new mutant created bypass 100% current vaccination, unlikely btw, would take unzil June July would detect it, would widespread original country July August, rest world maybe October November. Vaccines production ramping much, able give booster shots (a 3rd dose, remember people need 2 doses, 1, vaccinate 2x faster) everyone wants 3 months. Pfizer said 2nd generation vaccine fully targeted nasty brazilian south african variants ready September. didnt still produce original 2 shots per person vaccine, would able flood modern countries 3rd booster shot Christmass.

So, need focus giving people first round protection asap, people imunized new nasty variants emergence, production capacity delivery high level speed able protect people faster possible variant could spread ( people receive booster shot per day many people get infected). Pfizer says production ramp several billion doses per year, covered continue rate vaccination speed.  25% irish adult population? That’s impressive. Wait til find way Covid causes blood clots! threat, expression desperation.

At least thats read it. everyone vaccinated, nobody safe therefore everybody responsible everybody. US surplus vaccines tired this. also fact that:

getting virus =/= getting disease

testing positive certain tests =/= COVID 10 minute rule here. it’s raisin finds might well 5 day rule.

Yes it’s first kid, handle it. eradication happening. 1.4 billion aid already provided ongoing coordination continue support. Yeah, little action. Good call. Still means new vaccination campaing... logistical political difficulties. 

It's gonna hell ride years. numbers severely undercounted India. don’t know that’s true Germany. OP's article without Even countries many folks speak bs china called tcm eat animal.bones limbs peddled cure corona virus . political parties like india talking India yaha aise hi hota hai . paid price became corona postive . Nixon America's president saw somethings indians look . feel put people pedestal show  true faces get angry . Postion cheif minister small 5 years tenure like vote Arkansas they’re loud majority curious, located? Nothing open under-40s yet approved vaccination unless certain conditions work healthcare/LTC province (Ontario, Canada). vaccine rollout mess tbh we're paying price it. See, think helpful hyperbolic stuff. already hard us all, mentally, I've taken trying put everything perspective every day.

I highly recommend mediation least reflection get handle stress.

I often quote George Carlin bit ""think dumb average person 50% people dumber that"" technically true, really worldview changed pandemic stupid people shown us.

That's things like Project Awesome Humans NY good nuance humanity.

That said, think I'll ever trust 50% white men ever I'm white. stupid apparently pumped directly whatever bag feral cats serves lack brains. article right. It’s hard define finish line country. personal finish line close friends family finishing shots reasonable. also gives nice concrete event look forward to. close family least first shots. three weeks least two weeks second. I’m excited. heard anything recently, open tourism resorts January reported lot tourists keep testing positive ([news source](http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2021-01/09/c_139654311.htm)), could explain numbers.  Hey really educate viral mutations viral spread actually works spout narrow-minded conjecture. 

None variants seen able completely evade vaccine make deadlier. 

You seem suggesting lockdown end virus longer ""running"" anywhere due risk mutation?

Could explain permanent state lockdown due influenza virus still there? mean there's always risk influenza could mutate deadlier vaccine immune form right? Especially since mutates much faster rate covid does? 

Do favor get vaccinated lighten up. Germany really leader free world right now. United States rest EU slink behind. Luckily EU ordered two billion vaccines variants Pfizer Moderna. scheduled large delivery bound Poland (and subsequently EU) end month cancelled.

Astrazeneca declared beginning month would deliver 1m doses last week April. means around 12m doses scheduled week EU also cancelled. long forgotten Uk restrictions living life. Humans tend forget bad remember good. Scotland opens tomorrow hospitality won’t long forger good Australia has. Sure, not? article written lot assumptions.

 example might better look instead make assumption could missing important information first look closer.  That's due economics better healthcare system. US huge domestic biotech industry threw billions dollars speed vaccine development secure supply. Europe Canada advantage abundance doses negotiate better contract US banked AZ vaccine unfortunately ended sputtering production. Even advantages actual distribution US logistical shit show last couple months really started hit stride. Czech Republic Poland got quite near 50% certain points. Link? Cuz heard anything comparing exactly? fewer infections february-march gave people false sensation everything getting better wasn't. 
Take care make mistakes, shit even close over. India responsible situation, US. Bro kind response this?? 95% isn’t 100 I'm reading history East India Company minute. guys ransacked west :/ hmm yeah true, hope it’ll like that! :) vanish then? generally talking 70% referred to.

But also remember herd immunity threshold nothing suddenly hit x% - 60% total population *lot* people can't infected anymore, going slow things drastically whether technically herd immunity (and again, add natural immunity, see isn't). There's difference moderating article describes. “Smart” never really word Dawned me, wouldn’t ever thought people ignorant naive guess you’re right. live day age merely able connect obvious dots would deem “smart”, well “very smart” put would actually nice govt nothing. actively making worse. things done: holding political rallies, actively sabotaging oxygen supply states non BJP govt. Health minister endorsing untested vaccine produced quack baba. Letting ppl go kumbh mela knowing there's new wave. tweets deleted. curious country live in? brit I'd thought could supply thousand least, population India 1.355 billion, 500 oxygen concentrators drop ocean. seems bit small anything token effort imo. Particularly since India sent us 5 million vaccines weeks ago. 


The way make difference rest world (particularly west) similar. Noooooo lol.  Cases flip flopped - heading back down. everyone stays home much possible that's tends happen. Viruses care politics. unused Astrazeneca vaccines might nice gesture.  US currently sending aid India right now. Viruses like cold flu (among many others) freely spreading world population since beginning humanity itself. HIV spreading 30-40 years. Viruses don’t evolve, mutate viral mutations random, stronger make weaker, aren’t response environment, like would bacteria example. necessarily wiping Covid (smallpox), though would nice, successful suppression (measles). need almost everyone vaccinated, measles. one childhood shots. Note 50% fall followed 50% gain 25% overall loss. Also specific numbers mentioned net 24.2% loss. numbers even mean pandemic recovery? I'm Rochester scheduled appointment couple weeks ago could find May, looked yesterday thousands available week. Things moving quickly. Biden anything one complaining!  People typically die covid 2-3 weeks catch it. Soon numbers much lower Okay. insurance sucks. Got it.

This site full sensitive idiots can’t deal told something contradicts whatever knee-jerk thought conjured adolescent mind begin with, even it’s factual truth.   Lucky! I'm half vaccinated. 11 days join club. reason exited today? cases go stay low, OK sharing vaccines internationally giving Americans 3rd, 4th, 5th booster etc? Biden interested improving country charge *shocked pikachu face* agenda always put opposition bad daylight. talking India US? US provided $1.4 billion covid support India already pandemic. Including ventilators, medicine, medical training, PPE, etc since pandemic began. Media cover paint Trump isolationist. parent two teens, say is...hurry fuck let 16s get it.    surely you’re starting realise it’s bullshit..surely... Since comment vague enough true definition wrong reasons. misleading they're saying 'during fall peak' instead 'during winter peak' hospitalizations young people higher now, despite Michigan's total caseload peaking higher winter. Please report comments like remove appropriately ban. I'm seeing comment chain someone reported comment. seen ent allergist?

You likely dustmite allergy wake sinus pressure every day  source provides estimate herd immunity threshold using (I quick look find anything recent particularly credible)? Ah, realise Norway offering 2 doses BioNtech instead providing 2nd dose.

That data use case mix match based 2 vaccines 3 vaccines. nobody virus however risk spread. virus able spread it; magic. You’re saying something you’re providing evidence saying kids contributing mutations bold claim specific evidence that? Send vaccines like trying stop tsunami sponge. Vaccines need. Could start 20M AZ doses gathering dust American warehouses. five million people, nearly 8 percent got first shot Pfizer Moderna vaccines, missed second doses, according recent data Centers Disease Control Prevention. Even country wrestles problem millions people wary getting vaccinated all, local health authorities confronting emerging challenge ensuring get inoculated fully. that’s harder people lack access reliable transportation jobs strictly scheduled hours, said Elena Cyrus, infectious disease epidemiologist University Central Florida. testing Germany anywhere near good UK example (comparing I'm Brit lives germany works UK NHS.) But, last weeks Germany, citizens entitled free test week. We've also seen multiple new testing centres open am, testing increased schools, workplaces etc. testing finding cases good. 

From hear India, testing ranges ok poor depending are. likely numbers India heavily undereported depending testing better Vs outbreaks are. comparison, think Germany getting closer ""true"" numbers, although never find every case still undereporting thousands per day like every medium large country world imagine. 

The person right large numbers Germany less threat wider society India. tend live homes space room quarantine. practice social distancing communities robust social security. parts India impossible quarantine household members even impossible walk street 2m distance others. Also large country much harder pool resources across state lines like see oxygen (re)distraction sheer time takes move stuff one state another, due size also road train infrastructure. Indian government fucked big time forward planning lull cases. Much like Germany let things slip summer 2-3oo day. better prep could tackled autumn wave much better better testing facilities already place etc.  yeah comparing last summer numbers makes sense?  Yes happen, what’s virus mutates become less less lethal. take while, years probably, won’t always dangerous now. Since EU gotten Astrazeneca there? remember 10,000 doses asked months ago, worsened situation declined. obviously remembered correctly, old people responsible half deaths something like fallen 75% pre-vaccination peak.

Personally, think full, it’s optics thing.  27.5% vaccinated, that’s pretty good, right? Anything better nothing country 67 million economy $2 trillion afford 500 oxygen concentrators. 


We spend £15+ billion foreign aid, resources there. fact small risk made widely known responsible significant vaccines hesitancy.

If still get it, still transmit, still need mask - get vaccine?

It’s another example (Ex. surface cleaning) fixation incredibly small risk causing people adopt riskier behavior (Avoiding delaying vaccination). Waste want think would know - person who's read book person who's read books living 2 decades country? sold people never lockdown....we r best saying 55 young person? Surge last months, still time vaccines lighten load. also wonder time around beds younger people since elderly vaccinated. Maybe younger people turned away last year, getting beds abundance caution. sources support idea, though. Maybe listening now. World shud help talk tough indian leaders...otherwise happen months Yes said thing Brazil too. population density lack cleanliness good thing. India vaccine production? Excuse ignorance. thought producing good number doses? Oh see. Thank you! doses made emergent, ones stockpiled US. different Astra Zeneca manufacturing facility Maryland.

However FDA inspection shutting emergent facility comes compliance probably actually freed supplies India wanted exactly give without shutting current supply manufactured.

I also looked bioreactor bags filters made US India wants, supposed facility expansion major bioreactor bag manufacturer coming online quarter there's filter production facility expansion coming online next year. wonder additional resources allocated latter bring online faster? almost seems like filters might biggest bottleneck. break age groups vaccination rates percentages I'm talking about. month half old, newest one could find currently. 41% 65 older think that’s fair question. get point everyone (or majority) fully vaccinated think messaging needs clear hope is. silver lining 60% vax rate adequate (hopefully) based see Israel due high rates natural immunity high infection rates.  absolutely need children vaxed decent rate achieve imo. Wouldn’t surprised week two behind NJ surfing 2-3 weeks ago Covid19 - Death Excess Deaths Brazil (and countries), article I'd suggest anyone frontlines combating disinformation surrounding Covid-19.

Ok. whooshed myself. Downvote away. 5g Canada. guess that's we're one dose. Again, cdc cannot ease create restriction. 

Nothing eased cdc, ever, power so. wave started btw. Controversy allowed happen despite huge wave started contribute cases coming days weeks.  places starting walk-ins EUA 12-15 approved mid late May (it took month general EUA can't imagine taking longer 12-15). Hopefully hit close 50% population that. No, get problem. sucks coming generation. statistics people United States still dying every day COVID?

What’s got Singapore Iran..? get vaccinated accept relatively larger risk serious consequences get virus.

Unfortunately, pockets community tend live/congregate together we'll continue seeing lots preventable medical chaos &amp; deaths. It'll full schadenfreude, still tragic. majority 30% US's population claims uninterested vaccine eventually gets COVID (from contagious strains spreading like wildfire communities herd immunity kicks there) country looking another million'ish deaths. believe start eased per CDC starting shortly April 30. end first 100 days. Whatever aid send vacuumed rich/connected. Poor people left rot always are.  Well, sometimes see another fear mongering tactic.

I’m sure we’re family that’s this.  issue cdc say anything. 

Restrictions political issue handled state governments. One party keep restrictions longer (in cases maybe even years) other. 

The party already started getting rid restrictions.

Unfortunately, without sort mass recall efforts, solutions wait awhile there’s elections upcoming.  almost 40m astrazeneca doses American warehouses We've given first doses [3.5% world last rate constant would 18 months - around end 2022 - 60% world first doses.

EU US people w/natural immunity bc got hit harder pandemic, think 60% enough. India exporting AZ vaccine  article tells nothing. grammar atrocious, Smart Man. Sure, could change it, believe working that. manufacturers don’t much incentive wanted reason: don’t liability protection lot countries like US. humble prediction either US take liability anything donate required get whoever donate relieve manufacturer any. honestly shouldn’t massively difficult stuff scale guess always is. Hopefully they’re trying fix legalese ASAP. imagine broke contract company supplying vaccines refused ever work government again? could also kill people long run. hospitals full anyone age fitness level die preventable death unfortunately. Plenty younger Indians passing last days areas bed oxygen shortages. Remember EU older also generally much better bigger capacity hospitals icus. Civil Defense Directorate, tasked fighting fire, said statement eyewitnesses told exploding cylinder started fire safety system hospital, secondary ceiling made cork helped fire spread, statement said.

The theory (and often happens long periods time) virus mutates deadly, kills hosts spreads much kills off. weaker version wont kill host host spreads people survives.

Obviously thats high overview generalization gets point across.

Covid could mutate kill host within hours, going far. course could mutate kill host higher rate takes 3-4 weeks, person going spread time frame. think they'll absorb part evil 5g waves causes false pandemic, according dear friend mine

Also virus always mutate , we’ll never stop that. However immune systems shouldn’t underestimated either . immune systems responsible adapting new threats eventually recognize years go - think T-Cells created . immune systems weren’t strong, humanity wouldn’t made Bubonic Plague.

You’re also considering far vaccination technology come. literally saw history making mRNA tech past year. get better time. don’t think future doom gloom suggest. That’s downvoted . path virus takes society incredibly complex. infantile population lot less mobile adult population may actually make huge difference.

But clue, actually. percentages claimed enough herd immunity pretty much guesstimates anyway. simulations calculate values, make lot simplifications fed lot imperfect data.

The good thing we'll see huge drop cases way reaching herd immunity either way. time Cyprus enters new lockdown. [Coronavirus: India temporarily halts Oxford-AstraZeneca Also paper points out, vaccine liability injury compensation major concern man countries. companies fully liable many make vaccines. injury compensation vaccine France population around 65M. MI AL populations 3M 5M respectively.

Comparing MI Paris AL greater Paris area (Île-de-France) would fairer. I’d rather die live like that. reached point 55 brushed ""old, concern"".

Bravo. pursue multiple things once. prioritize American people, America has, simultaneously helping countries. shouldn’t difficult concept. excess vaccines used, could sent countries. America fine. helping others. Hope explanation helped bit! Governments always blame people. Even western democracies; numbers go up, fault behavior people.

They could scaled ICU capacity, never hear that. could put money healthy living campaign, telling people work immune systems generally good condition.

Easier blame people tell obey. nice choose attend concert like looks insane lockdowns coronavirus. Happy people fun though. [Coronavirus: India temporarily halts Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine Thank you. don’t know you’re getting downvoted, good point mutating versions coming about. None flu vaccines mRNA based, COVID-19 yet mutated drastically completely bypasses vaccine infected every corner world almost two years. also seen around 17,000,000 1,300,000,000 fully vaccinated. 1.3%.  enough make impact. That's false, geography drastically different. different river system (the Himalayan Hindu Kush), average climate nothing like rest (in terms Koppen scale), mountains part ""Roof World"" basically leads Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, China, Pakistan, etc. (the highest point 7,492 (24,580 ft) sea level). surprised, try going one popular national parks, like zoo. 

The way avoid crowds strenuous hikes Funny thing Polish government says delay vaccinations next week despite: 1.4M doses left 1.2 Pfizer doses arriving tomorrow vaccinate around 1M per week - problem. makes many think 1.4M doses lost, sold expired. :/ Exactly, parents w/young kids won’t feel back normal little ones vaccinated well. Wear mask slow spread vaccine availability, even hard. Indy 500 gonna 135,000 Memorial Day Weekend Canada also herd immunity sometime summer.

Definitely later summer tho.

Late July/Early August we'll start seeing effects herd immunity want stay home eternity Pokemon cards, utter manchild. got elliptical year ago. Things become lot horrible improving thanks delay vaccine production sudden surge tier 2 cities.

Fingers crossed we'll see downwards bend 6 8 weeks. :'/ worries! Let know end it, I’d love know outcome! :) Thank saying this. 

Do y’all idea many Indian nationals pay literally hundreds thousands dollars go get passport another country? idea many grow actual slaves working wealthy homes? Meeting wealthy Indian people US Canada really opened eyes insane wealth disparity privilege elite class Indians. Indian definitely say mass vaccinations would need handle current mess. 

Population huge lot Raw materials required vaccine manufacturing bottlenecked US Export ban materials. Even would produce Vaccines full capacity would still need 8 months fully vaccinate everyone. promise deliver

It's worked pretty well Elon Musk far 🤷🏻‍♂️ Breakthrough infections going continue ad-infinitum. coronaviruses endemic. Sorry hear that. hope things begin slow India vaccination speed picks posted bad source also alluded conspiracy theory numbers ""being cooked."" want participate sub, follow rules. Still, taking full allotment doses like EU countries, CZ scheduled get less vaccines average end Q2. Thanks encouragement! Without vaccination, won’t virus mutate affect children often? Schools daycares seem perfect opportunity kind evolution. CFR new infections Colorado (measured day symptom onset) dropped 1.5% early November around 0.3% now. Pray India According organizations, they're ""the gold standard"".

So telling qtips jammed nose nothing? No, false! eastern EU states problems price, Czech Rep. CZ order available vaccines expected come end year - everybody vaccinated.

There large amount problems Covid dealing CZ. price vaccination one them. researching last week, managed find actual AZ representative's comment article absolutely spokesperson saying. also administration saying this. Take word, getting US vaccinated sending off. contracts simply stipulate manufacturer must consulted sending doses. Don’t afraid try! end result makes slight embarrassment could possibly feel. could share countries? Celebrations, ""Vaccine powerhouse"" PR stunts, Election rallys not.
No beds prepared, ventilators procured, funds vaccine manufacturers, procurement global vaccines. ABSOLUTE lack leadership. Expecting private industry step nothing.
Now hear Twitter forced remove posts criticizing government !! Honestly, data risk people different groups think are, says otherwise. think messaging young ppl awful - people either think sure die get it, don’t (which true) don’t see advantage getting bc media govt make sound like nothing change. 

We pay ppl $100 get done lol adolescent turtles think president reached anyone, mate fun, sure. took around 48 hour mark finally disappear me. headache last thing go, may due dehydration. 5.2 million deaths forecasted Russia FFS course delay vaccinations? system last saw around 1m doses ready vaccinate vaccination points.

Those 1.4m doses already registered somebody well doses expected come in. Can't shift people registered vaccine people.

 I. Ok dry dd EU already said they're sending oxygen medicine, US announced they're sending raw materials covid vaccines, medical equipment protective gear. Hopefully India get everything need get top this. death numbers completely false, financial times reported went gather number covid death reported crematorium 17 000 compared 2000 like 4 5 days ago. Certain states like Illinois tying lifting mask mandates CDC guidelines. it’s rare really tugs heartstrings, case kid getting really sick COVID make local news. it’s still rare. Fewer kids died COVID past year die flu typical year. cases Dallas steadily declining vaccination increases. makes life safer everyone, even kids young vaccine right now.

Every time kid goes school, they’re going Petri dish, COVID-times not. course, right keep kid home long want, families right put kids back Petri dish. It’s economy—it’s education, social development, mental health. 17 thousand deaths 1 day ?!? OMG nearly enough, restrictions always late. It’s depressing. majority American adults gotten first shots chance government toppling that. India Africa.   Yup. 1 month lockdown. people never survive 1 month lockdown.

Strict masking certainly help Probably time say it, acquired herd immunity approach looks like  Even COVID, lot really vocal people Reddit afraid basically anything. They're living dream working home everything delivered. want go back. They're terrified get plane afraid drive. stories awful intrusive TSA whenever get plane followed ""AND NEVER FLY!"" annoying big deal end. 

For real site lot people never want leave house. also way many people never want work. I'm sure legit mental illnesses, I'm sure many lazy wastes carbon. mean, kind Wooshed point. Australia, NZ Covid19 free go lockdown even one case. government provides basic pay idea. India even count deaths, can't compare previous years. cities cremations running around clock makeshift pyres ~0 official deaths. cities lots official deaths.

Previous serology studies found 0.01-0.1% IFR combined official deaths. assume IFR actually around 0.3%, undercounting 3-30x. actually idea try get better estimate this.

Another problem slightest idea E484Q lineage more, same, less deadly. sounds paranoid say ""the mortality strain could 10% know"", but, well, 10% know yet. E484Q mutation seen anywhere else really know anything (though surely going change quickly). way donate money help India out?

Please let know. Shocking, viruses ebb flow regardless restrictions. almost like reinventing science past year makes sense.  Amazing see everyone helping out. get this! good news. Mr. Adar CEO India's biggest manufacturer clarified Twitter massive capacity limited US embargo. production bounce back. Thank god. currently facing acute shortage vaccines 👏🏻  always lived disease. one isn’t even radar far diseases humanity co existed with. People already living normal parts US despite everywhere lol Boo listening science, right? art deal. braindead liberal take I've ever fucking seen. idea many innocent people killed usa south america order ""fight communism"" secure american business interests? shit went abu gharib?? worried supporting Russia??? Pick fights fucking idiot."
