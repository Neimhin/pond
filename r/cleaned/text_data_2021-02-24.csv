Everyone else, time coming. start getting double hopefully numbers get low enough waiting extra weeks big deal anyways. Thank explaining well, think help explain introverted mother i'm struggling much. It’s fears. I’m healthy would probably survive. It’s link chain could harm others. That’s always point. tough humans resilient. think we'll OK long-term. Work home time awful. literally go office nothing day. Like point. necessary? Problem is, they're woods, even vaccines. Transmission low summer, things open, principle gatherings can't happen unless guaranteed cases spike again. one definitively say be.

It's uncertainty makes people give up. one say go back work, one commit deadline open everything matter what, without that, there's much done. submission basically way get readers pay attention ProPublica's excellent work.  trying rude, don’t know you’re talking one. 

The stock market often extremely irrational, else wouldn’t crashes. market crash, rational valuing stocks high? No. days, weeks, months, even year given crash, market actually quite irrational, it’s possible anticipate coming fall behavior. 

The late 1990s saw huge run-up Internet stocks, crash 2000. Similarly, big run-up stocks ended 2009 market crash. Recessions followed. say stocks rationally accurately reflect future isn’t naïve notion, it’s dangerous one well.

One main reasons stocks reflect health economy us experience rise stock buybacks. Companies often push stocks higher, partly arguably, raise value stock options management buying open market. 2018 tax cuts sponsored Trump led inflow cash companies, cash often went buying back shares. Therefore link economy, cash sloshing around company coffers.

But current stock run-up, reached new highs, first, importantly, due Federal Reserve injecting massive amounts stimulus banking system. Fed feared serious recession COVID-19 made apparent demand unemployed workers would fall. 

This showed persistently low interest rates, indeed interest rates remain low. interest rates low, stock prices often stimulated higher two reasons, one stocks discounted time-value money (which falls rates) people tend put money stocks interest rates low bonds don’t serious payout.

The amount young physicians tell plan leaving profession pay loans terrifying.  ?? policies place creating anxiety mental illness teens implemented zealots upended normal life vilified normal, healthy human behavior like social interaction. disambigous choice statistics. actual numbers: US given 20 doses per 100 people, Canada given 4.35. Cringe.  quit. obviously don’t give shit kids supposed educating would anyone want educator.

Genuinely, teacher suggesting schools shouldn’t person year “there three months left” quit fired.

Oxford lot states opening vaccines people live ""congregate housing."" health departments use language along lines ""...congregate housing including limited homeless shelters group homes."" There's debate college campus whether college living facilities could classified ""congregate housing.""

Bars worst places. [European finally catching securing vaccine supplies. challenge getting shots arms.

After stumbling gates, bloc shifted higher gear sourcing Covid-19 vaccines track immunize population faster anticipated thanks new supply pacts increased production.

Following efforts narrow gap U.S. Britain race slow coronavirus, EU may able vaccinate 75% adult population end August, two months earlier previously forecast, according London-based research firm Airfinity Ltd.

The question whether member states able massively ramp vaccination counter pushback, mainly [AstraZeneca [University shot, Europeans far refusing accept.

“The onus opinion member states prove manage rapidly accelerating roll out,” said Jacob F. Kirkegaard, senior fellow [Peterson International Economics. “Will ready? hope so.”

Vaccines seen key reviving stalled economies curbing infections amid worries new virulent variants could emerge. now, EU’s record remains poor. U.K., Europe’s highest death toll virus, administered 27 doses per 100 people, according Bloomberg’s tracker. far outpaces 6 doses EU. U.S. climbed almost 20 doses per 100, data show.

￼

The EU’s supply outlook brightened recently, driven partly [Pfizer [Moderna secure hundreds millions additional doses. Already, supplies probably double end March month, double end April, according Kirkegaard, cited projections individual governments.

Astra Tuesday said forecast vaccine deliveries bloc line contract European Commission, responding Reuters report delays. company working increasing productivity EU supply chain using global capability deliver 180 million doses bloc second quarter, said.

As supplies mount, countries facing new pressures. Germany, instance, vaccination centers could soon overwhelmed, creating “traffic jam” unless authorities empower doctors perform inoculations offices, according National Association Statutory Health Insurance Physicians.

‘Remains Serious’

Officials Brussels meanwhile warn it’s clear whether vaccinating three-quarters adult population enough stop pandemic, see long fight ahead. That’s mutations future could least partially evade existing shots. Drugmakers said able tweak vaccines relatively quickly needed.

“We need urgently accelerate authorization, production distribution vaccines, well vaccination,” EU leaders declare Thursday, according draft joint communique seen Bloomberg. “The epidemiological situation remains serious, new variants pose additional challenges.”

￼

European officials taken series steps recent weeks strengthen bloc’s virus strategy, several region’s biggest pharmaceutical companies agreed throw production weight behind successful Covid shots. That’s expected speed supplies continent summer beyond.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told lawmakers earlier month expects 300 million vaccine doses delivered bloc second quarter. That’s significant increase estimated 18 million doses January, 33 million February 55 million March.

Picking Up

The pressure increased Britain -- first country western world approve Covid inoculation -- races ahead. Britain, decided delay second doses two-shot Pfizer Astra vaccines speed protection people, may reach three-quarters threshold least single dose late June, according Airfinity. Hitting level two doses may take another two months, slightly ahead EU’s estimated timetable.

The EU’s executive [last week speed efforts secure deliver vaccines combat variants, also asking member states money back drive. commission already engaged acrimonious supply dispute Astra amid calls several member states get ahead possible need booster shots tackle new mutations.

This month, EU finalized accord Pfizer German partner BioNTech 200 million doses announced major new order Moderna 150 million more, also year. Moderna deal, Europe secured access many 2.6 billion doses, Commission [said Feb. able provide vaccines citizens, neighbors partners well,” von der Leyen said last week.

Dramatic Mobilization

The EU also contracts [Johnson &amp; [CureVac [GlaxoSmithKline it’s clear deals pay off.

Some large drugmakers adding manufacturing muscle. Paris-based Sanofi converting facilities Germany France help produce doses BioNTech-Pfizer shot along Johnson &amp; Johnson product. Switzerland’s [Novartis also agreed help manufacture BioNTech-Pfizer vaccine.

Glaxo partnered CureVac developing future Covid shots, [Bayer -- never made vaccines -- start manufacturing CureVac’s existing shot, late-stage trials, end year.

Higher production Europe Pfizer BioNTech shot another key factor behind Airfinity’s outlook. Still, shipments mount, critical EU countries get citizens inoculated.

Vaccinating entire population, opposed focusing elderly health-care workers, “is different logistical operation,” Kirkegaard said. “It require dramatic mobilization.” Also dead people can’t report back! tried buy CureVac, BionTech. Plus vaccines already pretty effective variants, even they're less effective OG strain. Kids school 6 weeks it’ll summer break. 
Next September it’s right back social distancing  course. impossible reopen schools safely staff vaccinated. Especially college level since room 36 strangers hours day. Covid looooooooves situations like that. And? Thanks man! :) brother teacher really turn every stone his.  get hopes up. new variants popping vaccines eventually useless we'll back square one. social distancing 18 months, it’ll stay way. glass walls gym near running condensation everyone sweating breathing heavy there... thanks, fact can’t believe ever went one those, always smelled like chlorine moldy socks. educating kids important teachers sensibilities. endpoint keep flatten curve? CLICKED THIS! oh agony many factors limiting rate Covid vaccinations country. However, finding people capable giving shots one them. physician don’t think I’ve ever actually vaccinated someone even seen vaccine given. Usually it’s nurse actually gives vaccine.

Well, know this, apparently Texas sign lists multiple counties. So... theoretically could signed counties surrounding county gone whoever offered shot first. 

Rather shocking would allowed, gives flexibility time ability game system. Boooo No, based that. FYI people call “the South African variant” common United States well: way school ever open healthy capacity mindset. horrible poor news messaging general science illiteracy/lack critical thinking skills caused. wondering too. Hopefully someone info this. NC, 7.7% population doses vaccination. Things need speed way get us back normal summer. I’ve never seen finer example someone self-righteous yet, wrong. Yeah one day (the second day) relatives too. fears

lol college also said this. WI. Wait, thought Moderna vaccine effective SA variant?  technically require it. However, try getting something approved without US data. Sounds like buddy. back pain, another person knew had. said full spine pain, alarmed ""spreads"". Feel better though! data people still contagious get sick J&amp;J vaccine? seems still get sick would imagine still contagious. I'm pretty sure make vaccine US Germany (and probably countries). Also, [Germany funded wonder decrease cases US impact this? keep telling drive Bishop's school La Jolla Country Day school. doubt would required. Vaccination reluctance high among well educated professionals. 

I worry private companies requiring employment outside specific fields like healthcare. Universities, public schools, international travel health insurance companies think likely require heavily incentivise it. I’ve 89% oxygen rate mountains 2-3 days.

Majority people living dont 93-94% publicizing March covid airborne though. Search Google find post (I'd link subreddit allow links Facebook posts).

In July still clearly admitting aerosol spread possible, frequent It’s really looking bad either

60% effective still par flu shot Also, US gets vaccines, Canada going infinite supply. US get hands enough vaccines vaccinate whole Canada month, demand dries Americans, speed vaccinations Canada pick dramatically. always going way Americans majority research production funding. result Canada spot back line, they'll still get share short order. really wanted speed vaccinations, they'd allow people buy pocket, manufacturers would incentive sell Canadians countries. DAMN thankful eradicated smallpox. amount sheer terror insanity would see widespread smallpox outbreaks would unbelievable. COVID deaths happen quietly hospital totally sight. smallpox watching family neighbors grow blisters painfully die front you, knowing absolutely certain next fate. want punish people governor might lift mask mandate? Fuck off. I'm bay area california. ""out door"" gyms open lol graph show that? correlate lockdowns working? Age obesity levels far bigger factors. sorry, forgot health conditions matter covid deaths covid deaths direct result actions young people.

High schoolers upset schools shut down, sit front computer day end sight, sports worked hard cancelled? bad.

You going go play sport college short period time get recruited, sports cancelled year never get scholarship money could way pay college? bad.

There significant increase mental health problems, especially among young people? bad.

Grandma gets sick going restaurant tired year isolation? Wow, selfish high schoolers played sports.

Every adult America everything right, high school sports ruining everything contributing 200% covid cases.

/s Imagine incapable making cogent argument think counterpoint. 

If lungs available vaccinations would definitely give lungs smokers. aren't, therefore triage based number factors. Namely, whether given person destroy set lungs due addiction vs person equal need without risk factor. Vaccinations rare necessitate brutal triage. 

We *already* triage vaccinations though. elderly risk first line, proper. that, expand groups next line risk. Obese overweight people who, again, also describe variety people *isn't* choice, among next group. 

From follows conclusion would need discriminate large swaths people chose risk factor based genetic disease related issues decided people power morally deficient character obese people unworthy vaccinations. 

Which again, irrelevant considering much health issues put people consideration vaccination someway modulated ""choice"". like genocide china? Yemen? deforestation? Climate change? Millions homeless poverty stricken people. 
Yeah w/e makes feel better. Thank god there's vaccines biggest problem facing capitalism right now. government entities paying people disability they're obese. say long haul symptoms Covid include brain fog, sleep disorders, anxiety, &amp; depression.

1. continue see COVID-19 infections virus mutates vaccine-resistant strains, somewhat similar way different influenza strains.
2. mRNA technology used vaccines facilitates rapid modification development; combined streamlined regulatory approval pathway, could need combat COVID-19 also highly transmissible viral diseases. Someone getting Nobel Prize this.
3. Public health measures social distancing mask wearing permanent, need remain place initial wave vaccinations, COVID-19 prevalence decreases point sufficiently rare population transmission vaccinated individuals becomes extremely unlikely. truly meant epidemiologists use term ""herd immunity"" crux issue. People already talking adhering measures reduce transmission grossly misunderstood context vaccines demonstrated efficacy. public health officials consistently stated measures must remain place time being.
4. fact cycling variant strains noncompliance refusal get right first time. bad gets long suffer depends entirely quickly public understands relationship individual decisions collective impact decisions. Herd immunity simply question vaccinating certain proportion population; rather, enough people vaccinated disease foothold disease spread. case, disease foothold; stranglehold. prevalence rate crucial component people ignoring, half cycle.

- [x] Soak warm, soapy water can't look cases March 2020 March 2021 compare two. extremely difficult get tested back numbers artificially low. vaccine 100% effective, there’s still small % get COVID-19 symptoms. Israel getting really good data % real life much virus shedding developing illness. said waiting zero risk? Well, people fans podcast disagree. Ventilation simple keeping windows open couple fans running. didnt write title  love insult, weenie, dawg weenie dog. thank gift  Dry cough, assume? NYS, going re-opening require testing sporting events, weddings, etc. see demand testing time. That's Democrats you. Hi OP, allow people post websites domains. said, opposed vaccinefinder.org per se!  Come on.....

It's ""afraid"". data data. 500K dead, previous estimates 10 -25% count (unsure updated not), mortality thing...morbidity matters well. can't hand wave away reality happened. Framing situation emotional argument sort macho thing afraid afraid disingenuous. economy? Fat chance 😂😂 400 17 million.  1% state Illinois (the whole state eligible people adults) got shot arm yesterday based daily report. makes happy, sluggish week I’m hoping stay relatively close pace. CDC estimates actual infections could upwards 4.6 times higher reported spent entire pandemic chronically undertesting undertracing  Honestly... it’s addicted bad news. year hell family. cousin buried morning.. month died Covid. died, hospital month. kept getting reports getting better - worse - again, better... he’s dead. also times situations things getting better took turn. want good news bad I’m point I’m cautiously optimistic. I’m hopeful also bracing shit go down. that’s surge excited about!!! supply constraints biggest issue wouldn’t fret much 30 percent limiting step production first foremost. you’re looking couple weeks states administer vaccines they’re holding reserve reached enough supply vaccinate everyone. top we’ll likely closer ot 3 million sometime March closer 4 million someone April may. Keep mind big chunk one dose vaccines. Numbers going linearly needs accounted for. matter USA style export ban UK style contrack lock result - exports. call EU naive contracts something change whenever might another pandemic - hopefully soon.

Yes, I'm calling entire vaccine procurement naive well thought miss point? EU 7 times bigger UK UK 10 times bigger DK guess cant compare UK EU?

I'm comparing UK France, Germany Italy would rolling vaccines similar rate things going well. seems complicated Wales/Scotland/England commonly referred country sovereign state. UK proberly nation-state ""culturally homogeneous groups people, larger single tribe community, share common language, institutions, religion, historical experience""

I disagree - think a) understand constituent components UK b) understand nation state is. narrow, subjective definition likes India, Russia, China etc nation states either. Hell, even Singapore qualify. Baden-Württemberg? Masks never required flu season. people want wear them, fine, let’s make requirement. Vaccinated around vaccinated really really low risk. vaccines 100% effective around 7-10% risk get covid every time get contact virus. among unvaccinated people, chances encounter virus higher opposed around vaccinated people. That’s vaccinated keep precautions unvaccinated people. Nah dislike word too, you’re alone! say that.  live next high school row crew practices. Every single one kids wears mask, entire time work out. see every day, including weekends. gym nerds weak. known (or least suspected) start?

That contracted via eyes glasses (or better face shields) help prevent that? can't criticize politician? Wow. protected species?  Quite clear operate, thanks. We’ll leave here. “Hi! can’t see well.”

“Nerd!!”

Sorry, never understood that. cannot make specific, measurable, attainable, relatable goals problems deserve consequential problem solving position. getting vaccinated pandemic standard people live way around. We’re anywhere nears herd immunity even according optimistic estimates you’re pulling shit ass claiming that. partial herd immunity combined likely seasonality lead big reduction cases reach high level vaccination especially presence strains reduce natural immunity likely see large spikes cases/deaths/hospitalizations come end summer saw fall due seasonal nature virus.

Your point elderly nothing address argument. Anytime workplaces open people want resume normal life without risk killing 65 year olds need mass vaccination otherwise spread young people like older people even I’m direct vector disease spread. Yo say stat I’m supposed care 65+ year old dies especially literally means bring number tiny tiny fraction now. Vaccines highly effective full proof. people vaccinated workforce means it’s drastically less liekly everyone get sick including vaccinated example cannot vaccinated. It’s basic immunology continue obtuse. basically opposition based actual concern safety procedural issue. Second, immoral employers mandate vaccines extremely safe keep employees safe. state it’s fact fundamentally don’t agree. Vaccines overwhelmingly safe problem employers, schools, etc mandating them. fact would argue companies moral obligation protect employees included mandating vaccine safe reduces chances employees spreading disease loved one. Take ant vax mandate shit elsewhere. point govts media lie constantly never held accountable. trust definition insanity, especially actions taking immense global always thought got nerd immunity friends... unvaccinated people interact meeting vaccinated friends?

That's masks for, friend. risk dying risk long side effects covid. going millions people degree disability due covid would rather people still taking precautions 70% population vaccinated reach herd immunity. Otherwise 7% vaccinated people still infect non vaccinated continue spread. Dying sometimes worse outcome individual.  bro, even vax?? vaccine end game. Period. nothing past “vaccine”. want keep restrictions place scary variants, vaccine might work 100%, etc., etc., you’ll forever.

As understand it, endgame end pandemic, i.e., longer circulating community, vaccines best way reliably that. Thousands people day still dying; *bit* premature talk reluctant open indoor dining already.  uptick seems happen seemingly overnight.

From Twitter people seem trust, believe looking March 6-7 cases begin rise US notice. 

Overall numbers ticking back last 3 days.  Last summer even vaccines people could eat outside NYC. I’m sure summer. It’s hard sit outside safe careful.

But definitely stay home concerned. find way predict days weeks equipment gonna fail, give half call pay Ventilation extremely important. Think like someone smoking. see/smell smoke ... know covid travel similar airflows. I’ll upvote ya man. Fug dem hoes Yeah know wasn’t disagreeing! can't imagine excited must've finally accepted transplant, especially middle pandemic im sure they're harder come by. bet loads loved ones absolutely thrilled able get transplant well :/ upsetting story indeed. science communicators thing. Somebody get Bill Nye epidemiologist equivalent attached Fauci asap. Indeed, outdoor class much feasible summer. Honestly sick late January 2020 lot people around sick, brushed “the flu” corona kind meme time, I’d honestly bet corona nobody tested time symptoms. Plenty places capitalism promote that. agree, huge disconnect would think whatever planning took place would catch that.

As Mayor heart often right place; skill administrator leaves something desired though. Remember basic decisions revolve around health metrics numbers released govt agencies? remember. simple times. Humans good told aren’t (and cannot be) control something, especially something big disruptive Covid. “micro” scale, basically influence (but still fully control) risk exposure. that’s far goes; cannot actually influence big picture ultimate outcome much. pandemic respiratory virus, humbling fact could probably *speed up* (and get faster) tried—i.e. literally opposite social distancing basically giant Burning Man-style “pox party” several weeks, would (again theoretically, thought experiment, based data) hasten end pandemic, vastly accelerating first phase. appear true reverse, least terms metrics actually matter. Yes, spread “case counts” time via suppression, ultimately means vulnerable risk exposure LONGER period time. also ensures we’re adding “new batch” medically vulnerable people almost constantly, people’s health deteriorates isolation, depression, inactivity, lack medical treatment conditions.

Overall...as unpopular still is...there’s REASON WHO, CDC, every public health organization detailed pandemic management plans place, emphasized *keeping society running normally possible*. Turns out—as many things—a moderate, middle-of-the-road approach works better better outcome either extreme (extremes deliberate pox party one side disease eradication other). Hopefully “the powers be” (re)accept reality soon. goal here? want Reddit stop America-Europe-Centric?

Yes would nice. world, happens term “not communist countries”, bar Americans Europeans set treat other.

Yeah, think stupid arbitrary bar. basically bunch rich people jerking rich like rest world matter.

Many still cleaning surfaces primary concern, people wear mask walking around take desk, almost nobody stays 6 feet apart entire shift. I’m lucky room I’m glass walls, see people coming, even though door closed people pop open stick head in. bothers know coworkers well meaning, simply understand situation made little effort educating updated information Well shit. probably can't part housing already paid rather close put ridiculous restrictions place knowing people say, fuck that.

They're actively scamming students. they're getting near people (e.g. playing kids), close zero risk. he's playing children unmasked something, technically small risk transmission, unlikely extent probably worth worrying about. completely agree like you, thought gyms going no-go zone, hence go almost year. 

However, sub want discuss, want command jump conclusions. sucks, ask evidence conflicting reports opinions, get downvoted ignored. 

I'm genuinely open changing opinions, time ask genuine counter argument, ignored. Mind blowing. people actually lived polio saw real effect vaccines around them.

Political propaganda US really become issue time.  rollin dice! love There's fair bit negative news going round side effects vaccine comments bit dramatic. Saying everyone loves bad news feeds negativity etc. reality people cautions good news time time we've told things might get better now, weeks, bam something else happens like 3rd wave super infectious variant, etc. Plus many experts expecting end March worst yet US due variants arrival country lesser restrictions. Lol “that’s all.” frequent activity highly dangerous (relatively) yet people choose accept risks risks outweighed benefits

This said, followed actually, yes. point make sense directly compare total lives lost driving vs COVID - much going numbers.

...and started stray bullets flying backed quickly. think understanding risk tolerance needs thorough still level risk persists quite time, mean shut society perpetuity - point becoming question trade-offs. 

This true - vaccination efforts moving rapid speed, would anyone lose focus goal - minimize loss life make safe return normalcy? try save month there, possibility unmanageable outbreaks acceleration mutations make sense. we're talking difference spring late summer, we're better opening slowly. social economic impact delaying - negative, without doubt - overall, chances successful return normal life better get point least 80% nation immunity, whether prior infection vaccination. Mother law hasn’t read enough yet. That's jim's fault management approves vacation busy week soup brains word “ubiquity” complex vocabulary handle easier governments pointing finger instead blame belongs, governments. Maybe mistaken, it’s 100%, admitting still possibility spread. good news would virus weakening common cold Pa? I've thinking now. u imagine difference concerted Wear Mask message across news media starting last April?

I'm surprised shortsightedness even right wing outlets. dont believe human rights want get sick. 

I think cultural thing US. We've embraced extreme individualism forgot pull together common cause. Even leaders forgot going long. We're relearn great grandparents knew never learned working together. labor rights pay, public health, voting rights.

Every healthcare organization losing money. elective procedures suspended, creates profit healthcare organizations. Many healthcare providers laid furloughed. people getting rich already-rich business owners like Jeff Bezos, pharmaceutical companies. We're supposed reach heard immunity levels vaccination late spring. would recovery take years? 1. Outdoor transmission rare. I'd bet money go Germany then. Since UK, might need vaccine passport, total guesswork stage. Oktoberfest would Europe needs point, I'm bit pessimistic it, they'll find way ban year :( Oh, know. know pointless argue. want everyone sides think, read this, know did. full disclosure, read 2 reports referenced, admit little surprised thought gyms spread appear have. reports (all things considered pretty solid).  
Now, look new report, seems way to... convenient? No, that's quite word. timing weird. would expected report come confirming/explaining surge cases back Nov/Dec, sort ""see, surge also partially this"". Instead comes cases dropping like rock new CDC administration. mean previous one job? know. mean go gym likely cause getting VID? think so.  
I guess I'm trying say want try discuss reports studies objectively slightly past, transparent thinking process, also helps see gaps thinking. agree. It’s frustrating healthcare provider see people act like everything‘s back normal now, still taking care really sick people hospital. deaths US yesterday covid day summer. mention people seeing chronic symptoms dealing damage covid. think July lot better. really get cranking vaccines even sooner. Fingers crossed. /r/2meirl4meirl must MENSA something. boyfriend feeling slightly ill, says slight muscle aches, couple chills, skin feels sensitive. 

He also self-proclaimed hypochondriac - saying insult him, feel relevant. 

We left house months contact anyone except other. get groceries delivered always eat delivery food sometimes. sanitize groceries delivery food. wash hands handling mail.

The chance sick pretty much 0, right? know fomite transmission possible cases area lowish precautions take seems unlikely. I'm optimistic time, however, work healthcare, fucking vigilant.  That's going stance soon get vaccine OK Twitter research, took look. saw nothing hotspots US all. question is, scientists predicted March third wave US driven variants right, evidence SOMEWHERE? articles shifting prediction April/May. Why?  think commenter good point. get plane, pilot doesn’t say “this plane probably going crash” incredibly small chance could. That’s here. far vaccines 100% effective preventing severe disease death. That’s safe going get. can’t use absolutes that, you? I’ve fully vaccinated since Feb 1. Maybe eventually, currently content current situation. Don’t really see need, want go back old lifestyle. know sure vaccination means can't still spread it.


STOP REPEATING HORSE SHIT. studies far show 90% reduction transmission pfizer Moderna We're already seeing real life SC. week cases going slightly took school back 5 days week person, indoor dining, allowing new entertainment center holds hundreds people indoors, etc. ceded exploding within another week. ... US remember, long ago, tin-foil hat wearing conspiracy theorists conspiracy forums saying, they're never going end lockdowns, masks, social distancing, restrictions, never going give power telling people cannot do...the never-ending fearmongering....there new strains, new variants, mutations, new vaccine, booster, update, on....and I'm starting think they're right. reminds me, I'm getting little low Reynolds Wrap. Brutal  :-(  😂 Lmao back public school they’d give piece water flour call “pizza”. Lmao what. I'm Florida, anyone 65 older get vaccinated free people want get vaxxed end hospitals

I even recounted one cousin mine caught 'Rona back December get hospitalized one day, still feeling weak &amp; tired several weeks later. (without going details, let clear cousin ""at fault"" contracting virus; matter bad luck)

Didn't seem get neighbor's attention. attitude seemed ""well vaccine's 100% effective, wanta mess around side effects"". break math b/c figured wouldnt listen. one way another gotta live next guy, anyway things get better cases deaths going still public health situation. 

There millions still suffering months after, future hold others it? long term implications? 

My friend example, healthy 32 year old Covid Christmas, heart problems. still trying figure what’s going on. Based everything news CDC said, fine. pre-existing conditions, runner health freak. Vaccines rewards good behavior. go people need most. CDC study see many schools actually follow guidelines. Probably 0%  appreciate reasonable sub become regards DeSantis. they’re still pretending like COVID response makes spawn Satan r/florida r/FloridaCoronavirus ... people cannot stop drinking koolaid! data back bullshit. making shit up.

Sure, I'm reading positions saying, point pretty obvious.

There many people jerking raw thought lockdowns 2022 scary. many people, sub particular, seem crushed idea lockdowns draconian COVID policies might coming end articles like one this, nobody ""weirdo"" wearing mask public.

It weird occasionally see people wearing masks public, person always wears one definitely seen bug, frankly neighborly thing spread out.

Now slayed strawman, let's move others getting sick make somebody weirdo, makes good person.

Almost nobody disagrees this. constructed ideas head exist conversation.

Let's reset. question is, people happy mask mandates fits condition (social anxiety, dental issue, acne, ect) so, excited possibility extending mandates? 120M doses shipped March, likely 150M shipped April--including 1 shot J&amp;J---this gonna May 1 intents purposes brave. When? (x) Yes, assumption made vast majority deaths average covid - though it’s easy imagine slightly higher rate non-covid death 2020 due stress/depression/crowded hospitals. think European countries mandating FFP2, maybe Austria.

But achieved overall efficiency gain FFP2 vs surgical masks?

I asking lab test dummy spray, consider human real life factors, like well people wear it, dispose frequently needed (since FFP2 much expensive), etc. think theres also justifiable hesitance report good things people happy loosen stop careful. think key everyone seems dumb figure publicized - reduce cautiousness risk members pod protected vaccine, that's start expanding bubble ... hard figure one saying otherwise. They're saying please still wear mask public indoor places case still spread even though protected vaccine, sure, that's hard either. Fucking infantile whiners incapable critical thinking ... guess everyone frustrated messaging shit get go Let see combination South Africa B.1357 &amp; P1 Strain. I'm actually watching CNN right strategies counter seem adding third shot Moderna Pfizer. Also Anthony fauci saying vaccine take I'm hell lot smarter you.

Apply comment yourself.

Begone. Heard Lose. Lose weight. Lose. loose. even pronounced ffs! meant noncovid times. asked OP insisted life hasn’t changed wearing mask. point majority people; “able” (safely) see friends family anything people normal way living.

And thus peoples change behavior almost guaranteadly affected rate flu exchange.

Or anyone really think masks thing that’s changed? said 100 million first 100 days! rate, it’ll like 72 days! can’t trust thing Biden says! /s reason they're considered ""strains concern"" they're exhibiting distinct lineages mutations things likely impact disease's behavior, binding site spike protein. 

Even mutations *all* impacted spike protein, would still distinct. Grossly simplifying: mutation makes spike longer different mutation makes spike wider, viral effect mutations together may different either CDC page describing bit, information provide still stellar.

One reason SA variant concerning various studies conducted indicate pretty effective evading antibody response. Initial data shows people infected previously initial lineage received AstraZeneca vaccine significant extra protection mild moderate cases. study done South Africa officially found 10% protection, uncertainty margin made nearly indistinguishable 0. study enough data evaluate whether vaccine protected severe cases, even abandoned use vaccine.

Each ""strain"" unique set mutations, impact.

The CA strain appears resistant antibodies, lesser degree SA variant. lineage distinct SA variant, achieving similar things different methods.

The UK variant effective hijacking ACE-2 receptor, generally transmissible &amp; severe, also likely existing antibodies / vaccines afford significant protection.

Etc.

They absolutely substantially similar, otherwise considered distinct strains. ""wild type"" virus also sorts mutations, differentiate reason believe mutations significantly impact virus behavior. Similarly, ""California variant"" technically 2 distinct functionally similar mutation groups, considered single variant.

**TL;DR** mutations result functional differences, consider distinct strains concern. Every one ""strains concern"" something makes functionally unique known variants. Can't US otherwise would half population. think anyone saying grocery/other store line workers getting lots contact...the guidance general people.

Like nurses covid wards ger 15k person-seconds contact covid positive patients day....definitely 6' rule either. things pretty much universally agreed goal, completed yet. Delivering epic moment inspiration suddenly unites nation virus gives everyone something believe something half country would actively oppose due partisanship; really see happening. care mandatory not, take either way. want possible.

no. Yes least require future buildings good ventilation &amp; possible direct covid relief funding improving exisiting buildings much possible. save illness &amp; misery reducing outbreaks anything future.

I wonder anyone done study estimate much regular respiratory spread illness spread would reduced schools hvac. many fewer sick days kids school staff would save less spread flu etc? Seems like HIPAA kinda ruins whole vaccine passport idea

Also, classist fuck. rich people rich nations able travel? Yeah right   noticed anyone ""intensely eager vaccibate prisoners"". Completely opposite fact. Good making sure know opposed yo though, eh? prevent people sticking diets months years. 

This option. scientific fact. Nearly everyone obese tries lose keep fails, despite spending tons time, energy money it. 

These people.who want fat stupid incentives argument. 

You denying scientific fact. announced goal last December suppose. say anxiety wearing mask. think parents, friends, kids, etc. going die, things get stressful. may overt moment, shit wears down.

this create incentive sign up. let google, apple, amazon figure get children grandchildren sign up. companies good targeting advertisements need see them. lso would companies get benefit smaller companies? would sound like government playing favorites.

Otherwise, official CDC recommendation, many doctors recommend waiting 90 days anyway: since risk getting reinfected time low, don’t really need vaccine right away. Yes. STEAM religious meaning Private school. got us there. clients mask.

Holy f--k. put it? able shower doesn’t mean anything. saying sweaty smelly it’s uncomfortable? You’re catching spreading virus didn’t shower. Going home sweaty pretty minor concern. 

I think you’re almost making big issues secondary focusing sweat. sweat people somehow never breathed, would basically virus. It’s fact people gyms restaurants bound remove masks. That’s central issue along wet masks less effective, also likely taken off. Considering company paid billions dollars lawsuits products, think I'll wait one ones, thanks. bad q’s don’t want this.  Redditors seriously another planet. Literally every gym packed people moved lives people still deciding going go back gym 2021.

You guys keep hiding home. You’ll find rest us gym. Governments rarely govern people.

Since Chernobyl support nuclear power Germany, even green / ecologists decided would rather coal plants nuclear power. course really want renewables, always clear move away nuclear would mean dirty energy decades.

I'm also sure would blame dislike AZ vaccine government there. People generally well educated finer points vaccines efficacy. numbers get coverage press efficacy preventing type illness. cases mild mild-ish, AZ lot less efficacious preventing Pfizer (or BioNTech, Germany would prefer).

I'm also curious see J&amp;J plays US, since efficacy preventing illness mid 60s, therefore far cry Pfizer Moderna. They’re also talking possibly needing regular booster vaccines perpetuity now.

Like I’m sorry. I’m antivaxx slightest, take virus seriously virus going shown 100% cause infertility mental retardation even consider getting booster shots regularly rest life. It’s gonna fucking happen. feel like really fragmented state. qualifed friends family CA FL getting timely vaccines, equally qualified friends family MD can't get them. 38,000 Americans died car crashes 2019.

500,000+ Americans died COVID19 2020. fact predominantly minority communities want go back leans even idea lack confidence school district health concerns. Looking demographic trends vaccine hesitancy minority communities also lends conclusion health concerns driving factor behind responses. 

Also, already pulled stats earlier someone else, multi generational homes like describing rare US could come close accounting responses.

Also saying kids learning remote education ongoing disservice them. good example happens government fails you.

You intend right thing sitting rationalising behaviour know dangerous. 

It sad. feel you. huge op legit skimmed get gist. partner doctor lot briefing regards covid 19 vaccine such. reason came “so quickly” scientists working general vaccine sars years able shift focus specifically target proteins Covid 19. think follow Israel's approach re: immunity passport. Certain activities restricted proven antibodies, whether recovery vaccination.

That's way bring swift end people insist ignorant refusing vaccinations anything strict medical reasons. world live sadly. Yup. Peer review important bc another person see different lenses

I’ll see waiting get good stuff (mRNA). understand anyone would willing take less effective treatment risk factor.  You’re welcome work home. rest us gym.  Also, Moderna Pfizer US trials, “original” strain (there actually two strains). J&amp;J includes data UK South African variants pull average down. 

The fact J&amp;J isn’t going quite effective two, Moderna, especially Pfizer aren’t great South African variant (and there’s California variant). think it’s hilarious they’re talking he’s dead and/or career over. Depending injuries career probably it’s funny see acting way I'm sorry suffering hope things get better you.

I'm sure intend way, I'm pretty sure downvotes comment come across something like ""well worse, I'm suffering complain"". right. short answer animal reservoirs. Maybe clergy leave Mexican stuff practice medicine. actually comforting anyone becoming part problem. ny vaccinating asthmatics prescribed albuterol kid last year....

does make asthmatic? id like sign up, dont wanna commit fraud....but know asthma something range extremes wheezing, breathing bit wheezing run never attack anything. here’s story:

My spouse active duty military person. moved Washington Spring 2019 job. settled in, explored new city, made acquaintances work, etc. didn’t really make “good friends” first year, pandemic happened, world shut down, acquaintances disappeared, spouse. 

All “good friends” family 2,000 miles away. haven’t seen since September 2019, last time visited home pandemic began. Traveling pandemic risky. 

If lived within driving distance, I’m sure would masked outdoor meetups friends. everyone lives around corner people love, overall traveling pandemic risky cost prohibitive, both. Flights cheap, I’m willing risk health friends family hopping flight seeing right away. able stay somewhere away home several extra days properly isolate covid test isn’t reality many, many people – including spouse myself. 

I hope story sheds light people “haven’t seen friends all.” It’s we’re staying isolated meager miles away – us unfortunate distant living situations.

Anyway, pandemics suck. Here’s hoping one soon 🥲 Sweet!! got first pair glasses back last March 39 years. know blessing disguise. look data (for school also nationwide), kids choosing stay remote much likely lower income, Black Latino, communities hard hit covid. also likely multigenerational homes risk household members. kids coming back skew white well off. It’s parents think child won’t get education person. It’s parents seen covid hit communities well founded fears child bringing home. kids learning deserve chance schools’ full support. Considering 0 cases variant November half variant, yes spreading while. It’s nothing speculation, although research hasn’t peer reviewed (like research showing new important things throughout pandemic). irony concerned equity justice also tend concerned covid - likely favor school closings. Absolutely good news Adenovirus-type vaccine COVID-19 stored longer refrigerator mRNA vaccine Moderna. [Here NY Times interactive feature vaccine works. Includes temperature needs stored Well one want get fucking virus lol I've turned workaholic winter. nothing work. cold ride bike, bars, concerts, travel. work. places numbers still sinking original variant, British variant increasing like crazy R° increased. Netherlands lockdown curfew example, numbers going every week, UK variant cases increasing concerning amount. know much worse outside.

I've found folks, definitely including highly educated, tend good whatever exactly - still regular fools domains. definitely describes too.

So, someone nurse mean educated vaccines anyone else. odds crossing street fatally struck passing car 1 1000, bet ass cross street lot sparingly. Weights pretty much. never anything home pre covid place put weights even stock point last year. leaving home getting something, really needed. lot general, days repetitive especially working home. Moot* point.... judge people grammer spelling abilities.

Bone-apple-tea! What? That’s insanity. I’m sorry that’s awful. throwing $10 cover fee house party 50+ guests, fine. wow. Yes, might well take soonest offered take off-chance waiting second dose supply issues. safest choice. Demand exceeding supply everywhere around country vaccine. What’s stopping living different life ? Make best situation try meet new people new things trust find stuff ! places open time restrictions plaid become color people dont use Google, Apple, Amazon? access internet? 

Also would companies get benefit smaller companies? would sound like government playing favorites. can't rush process force vaccine manufacturers assume risk.

If countries provide liability protections, wait untill normal vetting process completed.

The vaccines made quickly. risk that. decided risk acceptable given danger covid presents. one entity bear that. Here's example one thousands workouts found online 2 seconds apartment again, run weekends. 

Weights home. 

Walk jog outside lunch break.

Problem solved. given 15 fucking days vacation year would take days there. feel horde hopes use actual vacation.

TL;DR job hunting place gives 20+ days vacation. negotiators demanded additional indemnity civil claims citizens might file experienced adverse effects inoculated. 

If nothing else, seems like reasonable demand. Um gyms aren’t opened up? Even New York r open Got Moderna Vaccine February 3, job second dose scheduled Thursday Friday week. I'm certain getting second dose first week March. 28 days first dose, March 3. take tomorrow Friday okay? huge feeling seeing second dose first week. Good Question might try COVID-19 task force knew strain deadlier B.117 UK Kent B.1357 South Africa P1 Brazil. Since I'm NY NJ first case B.1357 South Africa Strain Nassau County, NY. Right.. except whole employment thing.  Life gets much better 21. It’s impossible see feel way can’t know what’s coming future. get confident, relationships get stronger, make money, clearer understanding want life. Think much you’ve grown since 14 17. process never ends. sure fuck would assholes ducked measles vaccine. take many, spreads like wildfire.  Antibodies aren’t one one scale protection. Two thirds less antibodies translate mean two thirds less effective. 

Crudely, 100 antibodies vaccine 95% effective, variants 30 antibodies recognize it, overall efficacy might drop 60%, still enough antibodies mount defense infection. wish work piece shit company. Even exta day two would nice.  Girlfriend NP, amazed hear many want vaccines.. Although pretty much covid already know dealing with. New headline, less likely get covid actually afford glasses.  care that. want people.  Well, situation due covid. Sacrifices. temporary. saw posts earlier France problems tourist areas article referencing Germany. sure mean wave since seems localized know goes given weeks.  dumbasses think gyms safe clue. clean use version clean dry cloth walking barely touching equipment fact health units charge might saving grace Friendly reminder: study peer reviewed Haw haw! tend agree, possible regulatory friction drugs particular cost far lives saved. Really feather cap Thalidomide. know wasn’t Steamworks. They’re still closed can't tell what's real anymore. go jog lunch break morning.

You even need run. years ago runner suffered injury run. Happens LOT people TIME. find ways exercise. Nothing new here.

You cardio low impact. Go Youtube, thousands low impact workouts apartments. Thousands.

All hear complaints someone privileged. thankful health! many people types injuries limited mobility. People kids can't even make gym (do kids)? friends little kids barely function sleep find creative ways sneak workouts home.

 Unlike many people health problems injuries whatever else nobody telling never run again. temporary. Go running weekends day things week. bad!!! much Filipinos gossip, I'm surprised. far understood part problem people supposed get (health care workers) refusing it, hoping mRNA vaccines instead. 
However, bigger part problem enough people priority group 1 eligible it, recommended 65 year olds here. Obviously stupid planning. seen coming acted sooner. say: bureaucracy...
Anyway, yesterday onward elementary school kindergarten teachers start get vaccinated. also permanent situation.   Yesterday Shop rite, song “celebrate good times come on!” came laugh...People moping aisles donning masks looking defeated song played loud speaker. Good point. live state today, health care workers 65 could sign up.

[Almost 14% US pop. gotten first Even pace remained flat (1.4M per day) that's additional 135.8M doses June 1 + 66+M already administered 205 million. There's 250(ish) million US adults. I’m living life fine staying safe home, thanks. getting info FDA requires clinical trials completed America? would new rule, true. Hiw much giving us march? wrong. Employers general, especially larger companies, give one shit you. number expendable additional overhead cost nuisance live make profit. work done, though. beginning trials intentionally expose vaccinated volunteers various strains Covid, believe would *normally* come approval. emergency use, still subject quite strict scrutiny, overall testing process simply can't rigorous. I’d compare many people dying coronavirus city vs cities, mine significantly less adjusted population, I’d give medical advisor promotion. Every 60 seconds Africa, minute passes. Yes, that’s “antibodies” mean. That's odd thing. entire population vaccinated EUA. what's point full approval then? Absolutely. would say approximately zero public support kind ongoing restrictions guidelines vaccination available general population period time (say, couple months). Say July rolls around hard data telling us enough people gotten vaccine could still another wave virus go back normal. point, longer give shit. chance get vaccine said no, implicitly accepted risk virus. toeing line faithfully well year point, officially done. wave almost entirely contained within population people directly accepted risk. Fuck them. terrible idea unless want viral news article. Wait turn. protect variants? article says public phase 3 data available. countries, approved vaccines, getting access Phase 3 data approving it? Finally found it. remembered someone PBS crowd involved this. couldn’t remember was. Alistair Cooke. actually thought died receiving diseased tissue, turns remains harvested death without Fuk dat brah gotta get swole Yeah state question, Georgia, hasn’t even done essential workers yet :( J&amp;J shot might good match young people feel they're much risk begin anyone nervous taking mRNA vaccines. I'll hold Pfizer Moderna could see would happy take whatever get.  career HR going? Clickbait, like tenth time posted. mention things like videoconferencing. Honestly, spent time friends scattered around country year could travel see them.  I’m donating vaccines getting diplomatic leverage it. shouldn’t donate Palestinian Authority, PA already secured enough vaccines territory? Right now, anyone 50 64 lumped 18 ups last group many states. think people 50 get vaccinated sooner since risks higher probably won’t happen. think doubled amount. tbf pull off, cases also means deaths hospitalizations. theyve normal since like fall. meant say jail county jail, prison Super doubt it. Vaccines created January 2020 still effective every variant. 

I think may see booster one year (so maybe every year ‘cycle’) once. 

If virus can’t spread super duper whole bunch mega 5000 we’re gonna get screwed hard kids? think kids 3+ suffering psychological damage masks, think don’t understand kids well. Kids affected seeing friends kids age. wearing mask keeping friends wear mask slow spread kids together again. telling Serbia testing people's blood antibodies get injected? funsies? also focused classes. majority people know go gym routine. Reminder: get reinfected  mean, human being, would like statistic end dying cause people wanted 3 months ""in-school"" classes instead online classes. Eh call influenza steroids China. locked whole province, built multiple field hospitals, diverted oxygen supply one biggest steel companies, sent doctors country Battle Stalingrad style fight it.

Of course first encounter it, caught guard. definitely brutal them.

They paid hefty price ahead time, relative safety now. even still periodically lock communities weeks whenever new cases pop up.

And saw unfolded China year ago. known better. ""Just flu"" crowd plain stupid. excuses. changing US. People use term ADD much. 

People recognize ASD recognize cognitive disability.

My son school focused ASD students. Social distancing controls hard type environment. good UK prioritizing people disability. Glad went well you. I'm interested jandj less, that's I'd rather roll dice on. I've severe reactions vaccines past, unlikely get unscathed people have, possible minimize risk, I'd like explore rather tell people first thing morning childcare I'm back feet. virus human history caused serious long term effects Journalists required expertise reporting interpreting kind information general care expert's opinion ""news"" status. Sell concert tickets. Someone Tbh cases go hospitalizations deaths continue fall evidence vaccines work time open more. 

Goal cases. Goal reduced hospitalizations deaths mean, I'd rather not. I'm young healthy highly doubt covid would hurt much got but... might. would prefer opportunity get vaccine everything goes totally back normal. Like, businesses schools still closed restricted probably reopening right now, would good mask mandates staying place large gatherings staying prohibited another couple months general population vaccination begun. see reason shoot foot creating another surge (even surge cases - even ""no one"" dying, disease still hurts people also risks mutation) close finish line, would personally feel comfortable going life surrounded maskless people operating restrictions. wonderful signal. Yeah, here. mom friends relatives 70, 75 still able get vaccine. I'd like know getting vaccines. One professors today (New England) told us zoom submitted course schedule fall department planning everything in-person. Really hoping holds true, I’m totally burnt year distance learning. Alchohol, Cigarettes considered essential, arent Gyms, places help people stay fit mentally physically? wife I. Basically didn’t leave couch day 2nd dose.

Could mean somewhere near 650k since last March already. I'm understanding correctly. Maybe 2 weeks. cities opening seeing significant increase cases / hospitalizations / deaths, keeping restrictions place actively hurting city benefit.

Crazy high demand those. would assume Pfitzer’s 72% day 1 jab day 21 people get 2nd dose day 21. counted day 7 14 nimber would closer 100% probably.

AZ’s 95% day one second dose apart. Plus temperature checks totally useless. 

It’s many people thought allergies &amp; COVID - people don’t end getting fever even do, Tylenol mask fever people’s normal temperature low enough could fever 98.6°. people seen wearing face shields mask 🤦‍♂️ Fitness cult. One I'm member of. work really hard physique lot easier lose gain back.

My gym safest placed COVID. average night count one hand number people wearing mask properly. Either bother, never cover nose. gym staff almost never enforce public health rules either. I've talked couple gym buddies think b/c they're healthy fit they're invincible need worry COVID. False.

I know I'm foolish going one thing missed early part lockdown. keep mask on, touch face, wash hands, try keep distance folks, hope best. job offers COVID PCR test twice per week far they've negative 😷. UK rules mostly either ignored, paid lip service. 

Guess depends are. Compliance generally pretty high live see. 100% doubt people meeting be. rules definitely ignored. don't. anything advanced would unknown ""enemy"" could protect people.

And stop there. could also engineer virus side effects could spread population quietly triggered something relatively innocent.

And looking downvotes, guess people assume something mRNA vaccines. don't. aware potential bad uses technolgy, something could go wrong much easier say nuclear weapons ever could. lower people contacts actually wash hands. everywhere. Half people late adopters changing minds seeing friends take it.

Would absolutely fantastic could receive VA well. would reduce stress level tremendously brother myself. state *has* taking back vaccines pharmacies contracted vaccinate nursing homes &amp; giving hospitals others giving vaccines general public instead. enough vaccine made yet people want it. really hope vaccine companies really able increase production like keep saying are.  It’s airborne stay air several hours. 

That’s social distancing indoors wiping surfaces pretty useless one wears masks. 

You get COVID empty room someone &amp; didn’t wear mask and/or talking, eating, coughing, sneezing. city really hasn’t lost much population (I think read 5%), people fled wealthy people second homes. part, people skills perform lost arts culture jobs still around, they’ve living unemployment finding ways make ends meet. restrictions start ease, big pool workers available jobs. won’t take years years. major ethical issues Pfizer well. Honestly, 'SARS-2' put cautious paranoia. SARS look like good time, sequels always bigger, louder, rarely better... small gyms mask use almost non-existent.

I'd like see spreads LA Fitness 24 Hours mask usage. Americans pedantic exhausting degree. you’ve spent years building fitness goal, it’s really hard justify throwing away. lucky enough space money put together home gym, get people can’t give public gym. one wants jobs. low pay hard work. Ok, deduced this, confirmed. boring story, necessary one unfortunate group researchers got spend pandemic statistical analysis 'obvious' whilst friends got show drug research reason seems like gym owners San Diego hell bent spreading disease. 

It wasn’t enough allowed stay open even lax enforcing masks &amp; social distancing, whole bunch went way advertise masks would required people could either deal find another place work out. 

Made really sad employees. wish.

I've many friends thought smart tell job pandemic ""shut I'm told."" like delivery trackers order pizza?

*Adam left the* *store vaccine 5:08 PM.* Hope didn’t find something worried about.  benefit ""unlimited"" vacation actually see much vacation accrued and, importantly, much vacation lose use end year. consequence that, see lot people taking vacation, basically half Microsoft works December many people trying use vacation floating holidays end year.

By virtue this, I'd say majority Microsoft employees use this.

Source: currently work Microsoft, used work companies ""unlimited"" vacation. Mr McTitties, go bathroom? Eh, lots things stock last year, even back lockdowns first started March April. set webpage trackers constantly refresh page you, jump something within seconds comes stock. put together pretty well equipped r/homegym last year help subreddit can't many examples government media actively talked form medication wanted people use. Germany (and France lesser extent) acted uncharacteristically stupid regards AZ vaccine. news? known since beginning re-infection possible documented.

It's reason get vaccinated ASAP vaccines provide better protection getting infected ""naturally"".

I'm surprised Canada got first confirmed re-infection, though. uncommon think *that* uncommon. people *genuinely* want end. Insane nice way putting it, actually. skipped last good year spend rest life working time life even point going forward

As someone latter half twenties, let tell -- holy shit, years 18-23 suck hard me. suffering pandemic, man, years deepest depression life, lowest 21-23 years.

But got lot better. took long while, things really get better. felt like much freedom soon stated working full-time workforce, especially relative college. pain college feels like distant memory alternate universe -- days barely even talk people met college, save select few.

Hang -- there's plenty room things improve. life begun. may seem like college people entire world right now, future world work, world much, much bigger place things. Apparently mental health junkie? home workouts even compare proper gym

It's fine many gyms. Masks, sanitization equipment person 25% capacity. 

Gyms struggling, employ many people along keeping many others, including myself, sane. Dude live country contact traces every single infection.

You severely delusional think USA contact traced fraction fraction known 30 million infections. I'm thinking. wait fall safer? That's school year usually starts anyways.

Of course even fall still need take basic precautions, probably lot less intrusive would now.

I understand missing six months school probably big deal, kids already year matter? part bothered start. never really general target given end capacity restrictions, masks, etc. beyond ""until say so.""

The closest thing end goal ever got seemed like saying ""until there's vaccine."" Even now, though, keep seeing articles even *that* may good enough. goalposts *constantly* shifting.

I'm sure things go back normal, people sick this, ""social end"" pandemic around corner one way another. said, like precedent we've set we're willing dramatically alter society based limited initial data gut feeling ""do something.""

*That* dangerous virus. agree entirely! I'm happy see sane comment thread This, unironically think mean developed nations. secret US considered behind social issues compared rest Western world. guys charge former gym. many cases traced socially distanced restaurant patrons wearing masks?

I'll answer you: zero. previous epidemics communicable disease, clergy offered vaccines soon became available, clergy could minister patients disease. hospitals nursing homes clergy regularly attend patients conduct services. Breaking news: Measures limit human contact make people feel isolated! COVID-19 fight, ~~Portuguese~~ nurses want pay applause

FTFY cases dropping people started feel optimistic , shadows new variant home grown gaining traction - started going vertically...

Hopefully vaccinations education keep everyone safer. contract tracing; embarrassing comment even upvoted. Truely speaks fake nature subreddit. wish people spoke truth. articles headline clickbait. faithful article scientific findings. know, enough real-world data yet. **Hospitalizations** 94% (CI 73 99) 5th week 1st dose according non-peer-reviewed based data Scotland. subgroup small death study also several limitations. First, estimated vaccine effects COVID-19 related hospital admission. However,  **other outcomes interest, including** GP accident &amp; emergency (A&amp;E) department consultations, ICU admission, **death**, rate secondary SARS-CoV-2 infection within households  well  maternal  neonatal outcomes. **We estimate outcomes.**  Yeah common sense wash clothes every use.

But especially initial phase pandemic huge shortage sorts dangerous decisions taken hospital management like sharing PPE wearing week wearing regular clothes without PPE.

If study proves virus survives textiles hospital workers could used pressure management provide PPE.

It still problem places.  Please see [our answers frequently asked questions [questions regarding COVID-19 comments containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

""Journalism"" fucked up. Someone gave simplified explanation I'll share you. note **the numbers I'm going type made rhetorical reasons.**

So lets say need 50 antibodies neutralize virus. new variants might require 150 antibodies neutralized. get vaccine body create 200 antibodies, therefore still covered.

From OP vaccines extremely powerful, even drop antibody strength, likely effective variant original version virus designed fight. Apparently economy important life. attempted going OrangeTheory couple times past fall since scheduled founder’s membership rate pandemic happened they’d started charging me. didn’t require masks location! canceled didn’t put fight either. data source read vaccine working age?

There's lot dont know random people internet. know people I've lost, things I've sacrificed. please stop acting like do. Best million dollar fly want Oxford vaccine, want Pfizer one. I'm fine hospitalizations used metric reopening (as long numbers reasonable). think gonna go route politicians still saying vaccine gets us back normal, since vaccine lower hospitalizations. 🤣🤣🤣 love response pro-lockdown bums. PF location super hardcore masking! feel lucky. I’m recently vaccinated started going, far good. Yeah, get that. less 50 cases Strom Syndrome world. mean, thought logic pretty sound? ok, close borders. mind numbing think about. Look working - OK let's let right near finish line. Smdh. Really weird world taking care body health gets judged people think takings small risks super bad  Isn’t AZ 95%? Yikes no, people get reckless later night Funny bring LA, badly even CA's piss poor standards. compare LA small, densely populated countries like Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam? course LA much richer much better, right? 

I know everyone wants rationalize half million deaths like anything right. sure temporary. vaccines. That's us need know. 

I'm sure live part country lot people getting vaccinated. know many many people already got doses. Sure sort variants absolutely get better place majority people vaccinated. Ah sorry, read ""country"" instead ""county"". thought stays surfaces? dangling around air Considering Pfizer paid billions product, logic makes sense.  NC, people comorbidities supposed second group regardless age moved last month behind teachers essential workers fourth group. ignorant comment, mental health matters healthy people, COVID really risky. course, important take precautions around vulnerable people. take ""risks"", better visit grandma overweight dad everyday. expectation among morons. Well, that's thing, know there's trajectory 100% guarantees full re-opening year. Obviously ideal think local governments going cautious reopening (perhaps overly so). We're already seeing major music festivals like Coachella (April) Glastonbury (June) cancelled. Lollapalooza (July-August) apparently still scheduled year surprise gets cancelled too.

Of course, I'd like nothing wrong this, since miss live events bars stuff too... I'm seeing enough convince we're going get things back relative normal end year. got numbers wrong. 72% overall USA, 66% effective overall world preventing moderate severe, 85% effective preventing severe disease death. hope results Still ready get back gym.

Oof. Pretty humiliating EU states turning China Russia instead they've fucked badly. Thank kind neighbour/neighbor! Back start summer realized total isolation going back-breaker kids, sat another family kids age (that got along with) similar risk profile.

We explicitly agreed hang other, like even seeing family, try get together least week. go fun stuff get house, example summer went camping private campground.

This obviously introduces additional risk obviously miss hanging people (and occasionally get sort sick other), think recognize *so much better* alternative.

Luckily didn’t seem spread one else vigorously tested nobody symptoms. felt like idiot risky precipice vaccinated. Everyone freaking vaccines, Canada incredible shape. US UK ahead specific reasons impossible us replicate timeframes talking. pretend grocery store club. Twerk produce. Yes, think key factor speed. people getting vaccinated faster. Every day February lower day week 1 week prior - except today. previous 23 days trend, today trend. think makes sense wait days claiming end days upon us. still waste resources contact tracing? It’s proven useless US  Yay maybe contact lens prices drop people abandon them! agree. People aren’t going anywhere, day day activities back normal. place honestly know small percentage customers allowed shop given time Trader Joe’s. don’t tell rest thread. want done April may winter weather slowed distribution vaccines, still low now. backlog since cleared, expect see million Friday. Oh I’m early post? I’ll come back later comments marinated will, Yesterday 7 million doses distributed today 6 million. March record month suppliers reach production goals Well, still premiers fuck things Lol I'm one wondered definition moving goalposts. compelling reason yes okay that, flu good reason. 

Work seen much reduced sickness levels (even including Covid), especially among chronic illnesses.

Possible factors looking keep, increased hand gels, deep cleaning rooms daily, social distancing, masks can't 1.5 meters someone masks public spaces. 

Another big factor think, anyone slightly feeling rough coming home, opened home working massively. Also excluded trigger points covid sickness, major issue get 6 months full pay sick year. Already schools Cali ruling person fall semesters

Must suck live one districts separate study scientists University Washington, posted Monday preprint server BioRxiv yet peer-reviewed, found mutation known L452R California variant gives virus advantage binding receptors human cells. deaths also period surge infections Northern California, making hard distinguish “between whether variant inherently virulent whether higher risk severe disease related factors,” including strained health-care system. variants coronavirus “will inconsequential, seen may enhance ability virus spread rapidly, change character infection,” Michael J. Buchmeier, virologist University California Irvine, said email. Lol nyt back pay walling covid stuff eh? think Canada's vaccine distribution sucks long something like minor fine refusing get vaccinated, current U.S. case law current legal precedent state actually compel vaccinated. Jacobson v. Massachusetts. Several cases spawned original, SCOTUS pretty much always sided state federal government. 

I believe come that, likely private businesses states create incentives people vaccinate. powers state federal government far broad stronger people like think.

Once vaccines FDA approved (which take sometime) readily available, usual organizations force people vaccinate schools, hospitals, universities, etc. wife date 3/28. religious significance #1 reason question is, entire population willing take vaccine documented lower efficacy? one vaccine, can’t easily get another interactions two could lower effectiveness. One friends seven months removed covid taste bitter things can't smell also basically optics I’m sure many already have, since generally likely deleterious mutations, haven’t spread anywhere near broadly peers. mRNA technology previously trials cancer treatments well funded. could see real targeted treatments kinds cancers. lost lot people could save millions every year “cancer vaccine” Probably saw Newsom shopping eating like normally would. 

His idiotic trip Napa indirectly killed thousands people pure arrogance hubris. resigned next day like decent human would have. know people severe food allergies gotten vaccine (both Pfizer Moderna) completely fine afterwards. make sure daughter epipen goes get shot.  symptoms start? Ideally want get tested 2-3 days symptoms start 6-8 days exposure best results still 20-30 percent chance false negative. would say you’re still timetable get tested one time chance false negative drops lot. effectively term.

You're conflating ""advanced"" systemic geopoltiical privilege historical exploitation areas Global South talking US among first vaccinated. I'm molecular biologist supported Covid-19 research since pandemic reached country's shores. thoughts virus shaped actually working lab interacting patients (infected recovered), ""did believe media WMDs Iraq"" analogy totally inapplicable. ain’t happening trajectory continues. it? would live events everyone works livelihoods destroyed? big assumption variant won’t able evade immunity natural infection vaccination. it’s actually wrong assumption, south African provably evades protection  sick wear mask go out, stay home. could data artifact. could brief plateau gets squashed ongoing vaccination we're back drops soon. 


But rule explanations like one.  Depends state actually pretty sure, think states make mandatory one point. feeling media government overestimating many people willing get J&amp;J shot. Either due previous company ethical considerations due lowered efficacy vaccine. one hope get one ones currently circulation. honestly wonder would willingly take J&amp;J vaccine even offered right minute, I’m sure lot people boat here.

Why can't variant that's less contagious, less deadly less feeling crappy? agree general, plan mine kep distances wash hands vaccine well.

The easiest solution would pay Google, apple Amazon develop national sign list states access pull people chosen categories, like 75, whatever. could give per person bonus company's many people list turn accurate contact information. would incentivize run television commercials online advertisements grandchildren. would turn analytics data mining toward problem. could signing people verifying contact information last April. bad news kind situations could helped greatly honest frank assessment discussion actual risk Covid. lot young people *massively* overestimate risk dying Covid - don’t remember polling source, young adults estimating something like 10-15% chance dying caught Covid. 

Of course, over-hyping every outlier case, hysterical anecdotes every possible long-term effect, little that... things like young college students terrified go back in-person class (and dramatically shortchanging educational experience they’re still paying full rate process). That’s going fight looong time. Anyone access whole article? seems pretty bunk.

Amazon CA issues like this. 5-10 minute security screening. throw loose stuff container, throw bags xray line walk metal detector. set go get wanded. Even busiest time year 5-10 minute wait, could clock afterwards.

Also, Covid screening literally walk in, smile camera, go through. took two seconds. could clock it. Opinion lawyer courts like closing clean nuclear power plants, government big part solution hands decide take advantage  literally American Exceptionalist term.

Bro stroke thought puppy interrupting news broadcast Virginia going win internet today, snuck stole right close business! frustrating first corona test first vaccine (BioNTech/Pfizer) developed funded Germany (with hundred millions €) far behind many countries. majority vaccines produced Europe exporting them. Half mRNA patents owned BioNTech CureVac able ""use"" it.  Early reports Wuhan saying thing: protect eyes. admit I've disregarded advice.  I'm glad they're studying it, least. Honestly, threat ""long-haul"" COVID scares personally. I'm actually okay idea dying, much alive debilitated months (or longer) can't work otherwise go life. lived first four decades life undiagnosed untreated ADD last several years learned make enough modifications lifestyle diet feel focused present without meds; very, last thing want return days incessant brain fog. Living like absolutely intolerable. cultivating mass. Hi all, finally time offered vaccine come, AstraZeneca. enough RNA vaccines everyone here.

I want sound antivaxxer all, vaccine bit weird, controversy age (only less 55), essays etc.

Though understand ""good"" vaccines scarce reserved old people like grandma.

So take right now? maybe later future necessary supply RNA ones. governor Florida, DeSantis, said gyms fine people work healthier fight covid caught it....
I'm joking. 
I hate really REALLY want new social norm wearing mask sick. Hacking lung office? wear mask everyone's going tell so, shun don't. case it´s probably lot people want mRNA vaccines al received Israel. think also depends country. don´t issue Denmark. way people interested shot vaccines available. Yeah, really think there's comparison last summer. clear time implementation closures restrictions destroys spread virus within 4-6 weeks, removal actions causes massively spike long. Pretty much without fail across entire ordeal, every time state shut stuff down, metrics cratered, every time state opened back up, metrics exploded. course intelligent areas country stayed restricted even spread low. that's obviously longer case vaccine. entire point vaccine return normal life. (most) everyone physically 95% immune virus, whatever want spread going change. That's totally different situation. right, good news. published federal state Baden-Württemberg (1/8th Germany's population) 2 days ago: immediate effect, Baden-Württemberg starts vaccinating under-65s second priority STIKO recommendation. means teaching staff, many medical workers people intellectual disabilities also entitled vaccinate.  people eligible vaccinate since week make appointment vaccination centers country. Baden-Württemberg moves second priority recommendation Standing Vaccination Commission (STIKO). includes many medical workers, people intellectual disabilities and, according decision health ministers, also educational staff schools day-care centers. supplied vaccine AstraZeneca - therefore people ages 18 64 groups eligible vaccination. That’s choice Yea grocery worker takes zero skill. replaceable less loaded word expendable. It’s like people forgot hard realities life. isn’t black white protects death 40% chance allowing develop severe covid. numbers averages across thousands people. individual, take vaccine, severity form covid might gotten without greatly reduced. taking it, develop mild form disease, without taken it, could’ve severe. get asymptomatic covid vaccine, without it, could’ve mild case.

So actual fact providing lot protection forms covid, deaths hospitalisations. I'm calling SABB course it’s discrimination, people wait September/October get first shot.

That’s something think fast vaccination program. tend agree home gym lacking one thing didn’t expect: motivation.

Home gym .. that's why. would first thing I'd change situation like \*logistical\* challenge enormous. 

Basically, pre-approve manufacturing distribution X million doses substance (and may never get) EUA. could done e.g. Phase I/II safety evaluated. Normally mass produce vaccine time Phase 3 trials, new situation. Yeah, that's issue. kinda built hybrid power lifting/ body building routine. since focused strength training supplemental lifts can't shit home. like I'm competing anything lol fun/health home workouts I've tried suck immediately lose interest. I've telling I'm extended bulking rest period. likely inevitable form.

I imagine Southern, tourist heavy states going favor it. they. trying salvage countries economies, protecting people

Even agreement reached, see countries mandating proof pandemic progress, able justify health grounds. would messier, expensive there's common standard.

If people choose take vaccine, suppose right (except parts Spain apparently) see moral legal right put people risk discretionary travel. almost certainly level fudging numbers happening, ground, anecdotal evidence doctor friends mine seems indicate cases dropped drastically too. Of-course anecdotal evidence really evidence, believe something happened that's dropping number new infections. Correct wrong, sort discrimination vaccinated people privilage vaccine available everybody? would ok use motivator people get vaccines enough, right seems would cause manipulation distributing vaccines privileges people. company boyfriend works gives $1-2 raises every year, orders everyone expensive shoes random stuff, gives personal gift $1000 Christmas. understand vacation time though. germany 
Yesterday first day since two half week found 10k cases.
My hometown example 7 day incidence number 51,5 February 15, lowest since end summer number allready risen 89,6 again.
And Federalministers talking bout losening lockdown... That’s true. dining in; don’t dine right reason anyone chooses go eat restaurant right accepting certain amount risk know what? That’s fine someone choose go gym go eat restaurant that’s outside acceptable level risk taking. Happy feeling much better reason feel responsible risk putting people. Working home outside always option like don’t want risk it. IMHO, slow process. expedited. testing long two reasons cannot really shorten:

1. Efficacy testing (whether vaccine stops disease) long enough people could possibly get sick. Incubation period covid-19 weeks, can't certain get infected. wait long enough enough people control group get sick. 

2. Safety testing (whether vaccine hurt you) long could side effects manifest months taking vaccine. 

As far know second part limiting factor cases. still compromise, side effects show two years? can't know that, highly unlikely impossible. decide reasonable balance risk long-term side effects benefit public safety. could possibly shift compromise, could mean higher chance side effects would probably result less public trust vaccines.  vaccine developed well Germany provided single cent BioNTech. Pfizer already spent huge amounts money BioNTech already working formula German funding (which minority portion amount Pfizer lesser extent BioNTech spent) came in.

Where see 6 months?  britain, south african brazilian walk bar Sorry that's total bullshit release confidence intervals result.

[Officially 60% effective preventing symptomatic reports it’s really nearly effective newer variants. It’s great vaccine highly effective preventing severe cases however, got COVID today without protection, risk developing severe symptoms, requiring hospitalization, and/or dying incredibly low. vaccine primarily protecting something I’m really risk leaving vulnerable long COVID permanent lung damage associated mild symptoms…. Unless, course, mild COVID actually threat me... 

I would get vaccine heartbeat would appreciate government would stop trying manipulate general public lying dangerous COVID actually is.  skeptical mRNA shots bc that’s newer technology

Those people would say J&amp;J shot inject GeNeTiClLy mOdIfIeD ViRuSeS. (Which, yes, adenovirus-based vaccine made from) think it'll help much. 20 million single dose JJ vaccines become available. end April supply might outstrip demand scale production continues planned. March 70 million people might get vaccinated. Wow, who'd thought lying kids risk COVID forcibly locking would negative effects??? Thoughts like worry me, naive bubble sounds lot comforting! think also hard media find cohesive story. ton outlets gone really hard promoting hard lockdowns masks presenting simple 1:1 view world outcome determined policy. 

In beginning Sweden way worse European countries ""Sweden failed"" narrative easy, looks average Europe fit narrative two choices, compare neighbors (I've noticed media outlets focus Norway Finland ignore Denmark since difference lower) create narrative Sweden backtracked lockdown (they substantial way). 

It help Sweden's current government conservative Social Democratic-Green-Centrist coalition strategy (until second wave) largely delegated health agency. really blows current narratives trusting ""the science"" seeing opposition lockdowns right wing. think overestimating medical professionals. difficult find doctors Reddit saying COVID exist/is cured zinc etc etc Exactly lot people know received Chinese vaccine followed appointments confirm everything ok, thankfully is.

Death-rate wise, that's ended locked whole province, built multiple field hospitals, diverted oxygen supply one biggest steel companies, sent doctors country Battle Stalingrad style fight it.

Because COVID caused SARS-COV-II virus, directly related SARS-COV-I, virus caused original SARS pandemic East Asia 2004.

100x wear damn masks

200x get vaccines

plus mile run

GO! Well, *think* would happen flopped stimulus checks? course discuss everything care team. wanted general thoughts strengths weaknesses vaccines. really Wikipedia link page crab mentality like common knowledge? Yikes. Talk arrogant. 

And bad, forgot expect every small business able afford tech giants /s. 

What douche canoe. didn’t go back gym vaccinated. gains lost hurt goddamn soul; running substitute lifting Nice! used early morning walks, winter came in. come back spring though. 

Got 173, trimmed 162 so. Augh, know. Social distancing mask wearing really taken toll me. miss friends activities more. understand, though, long pandemic raging states, hope last year. Interesting...

[Apparently Biden Harris going event commemorating 50 Millionth COVID vaccination tomorrow. assume means 50 millionth person vaccinated. 

Maybe data lagged? argument...you’re right many do. Yeah big fan factory farms either. Still think gyms open though. report fact? article misleading reporting 

It huge relevance burden healthcare system variant dumps half many patients hospitals. currently available vaccines still effective variant yes? “Trash can’t” oh honey, no. remember trip early February last year got bunch messages joking ""beer virus."" find particularly funny keeping news coming China. even told wife would probably last trip while.

I remember mid-March went eat twice. feeling restaurants already eerie. Still wish last meal would something better Buffalo Wild Wings, though wings travel well all, could worse. things open doesn’t mean mobility same. Keep simple, take me. Enjoy beer! This! waited, makes easy spread new variant. people vigilant know need careful. Gonna need evidence ridiculous claim March 20? lived New York, symptoms think might COVID? everything closed/got cancelled. US pandemic mostly over. probally 2 months left. End April probally see us approaching herd immunity far off.

Web site still use clickbating ""The sky falling!!!!!"" titles talk pandemic over!!!

But reality reach 60% immunity rate pandemic over. point virus die faster spread. probably around 10-15% already see spread falling dramatically. Imagine 40% 50% 60%.

By time may June comes around probably going busiest vacation season time. Yep. remember telling employees expect back April... guess never specified year... Based we’ve seeing looks like 99% second infections weren’t actually second infections. consistent everything know epidemiology. Nobody specific dates, would foolish provide date type situation. read experts saying. opinions vary saying us vaccinated next months. Regardless, covid coming end. could situation vaccines. many extremely effective. researchers working updating/modifying different variants. good hands. Good luck. ""Air-conditioning"" half high-school classes amounted cracking windows. I’m near resentment refuse take spite. I’m batting contrarian side cause know it’d hurt me. They’ve fucked bad want somebody answer it. completely support this. Anti-fat bias literally kills. heard many stories people serious health problems, doctors dismiss every single problem weight related. Later, turns cancer sort serious illness. fat, get substandard medical care. yes, please, let's keep hospital likely receive substandard care thus likely die. I’ve taking 7 year old park since May PA saw another day decreasing cases.

our weekly average daily cases 2427, last week date 3103 You’re right, looking separate comment mistook yours. Sorry OP, reply chain Lay-out app little bit awkward me. UPenn private university tho  like people learn mistakes fast long running? Also much weigh. would break thing week. I'm hard ore anything.  Also note South African study used 4-week dosing intervals, known less effective longer intervals (55% efficacy 6 weeks vs 82% 12 weeks).

Need study. Yeah sure. doctors suspected anything would received one, A1 health insurance. fine first shot. rate, feel little hung probably first last time feel way life. far know, danger getting vaccine currently covid. Great hear, gets excited Nobody said anything GOOD going gym. 

Nothing covid GOOD like before. considered explosion entirely everyone suddenly becoming health nut, running outside one ways work March?

Those folks going spin class, aerobics, swimming, treadmill running. go on. forced outside run.  right, we're never ever going get rid coronavirus risk, totally missed point.

You’ve completely missed *my* point. Eliminating community spread May isn’t “technically impossible always cases coming internationally”. It’s completely absurd conjecture basis reality. pulled ass. one annoyed use word ""jab"" talking vaccination? guess ""injection"" long. use long word, short trick. California here, we're spiking hospital, I'm assuming others well thanks Superbowl/memorial day jackasses idiots think we're woods already.  point? 

You also live without things period time.

Pre-covid used go mall could try clothes. buying online way less convenient me. Pre-covid used go large gatherings time. much. Pre-covid went work office printer, scanner, great work setup, large desk....now make tiny little space home. 

Gyms reopening soon enough. terms actual fitness medical perspective, talk doctor confirm even simple 30 minute walk jog home workout enough keep healthy. technology allows make Pfizer (and Moderna) vaccines developed university Pennsylvania worked closely BioNtech Moderna. vaccines going people supposed get them? That's really matters. care pop-up clinics ""upscale Florida communities,"" local Publix, Walt Disney World parking lot. I'm still seeing anything indicates vaccines going people eligible them, implication wrongdoing seems kind pointless.

If people *shouldn't* getting vaccines getting special access early, yeah, call out. Otherwise, starts look like petty political shit. schools businesses too. Restaurants gyms instance need upgrade HVAC systems. Condo buildings hotels need upgrade ventilation systems. Maybe Federal Government subsidize cost upgraded filters, least years... Ok well aware specific. Even really talking specifically worker protections I'd still say Japan worse America assume count first world.

I often found practice, many peoples' definition ""first world"" seems ""America, anything better"". course they're ""worst"" first world country - baked definition ""first world""! oversupply.

No one oversupply, country world. coming, give hope! That's awful. left gym state first shut bc already knew folks care less clean pre pandemic sure hell during. lot covid spread happened hospitals. forget number heard, cutting hospital spread minimum seemed like would wonders. probably now. models last year said 3m dead didn’t control community spread. didn’t do. So, 500k deaths isn’t ‘good news’ obviously, relatively good compared modeling. 

As far variants, vaccines efficient reducing hospitalization death variants. tf guys complicating shit? 

Put jab arm. 

12 weeks later, put jab arm again. 

Celebrate. Given younger populations hesitation take vaccine, cancel next years Spring break well. gym spent lot money putting state art ventilation system. that, distancing, mandatory mask wearing entire time feel really safe. Parks super low risk. I’ve going large park house entire time. There’s always people always stay distant one another.

If he’s playing unmasked kids, that’s risk stay away others stay masked mandated vaccination small children beyond pale makes sense me. thats line sand me. LOL, that's called ""cost-cutting guise Covid mitigation"". Much like self-storage place store things closed customer restrooms ""due Covid"". pandemic made realize much society hates people like me. class expected docile serfs work overtime ""Stay Fuck Home"". truly believe provincial government wants people like go away die. here. chance get Phizer get second shot March. Hate me, call hole, murderer, whatever. 

My trouble understanding ever became soft. 80 years ago saved world Hitler, cannot even asked care wearing piece cloth faces. opportunity realize weak we've become nation people. easier wash hands coming in/out zones!

Unless running water readily available, gel mostly useless. also fuck natural bacteria lead fungi infections, much difficult eradicate. India oversupply. said Pfizer felt Belgium safer option Pfizer projected meet contractual obligations. I'm really understanding US ""fucked"" Canada. want live rest life avoid cold? year depressing hell one would love risk getting cold sense normalcy. sacrifice it. still fit without going gym. 

What sacrifices making? risking life medical professional like many done throughout pandemic? working home 2 little kids screaming crying day, trying homeschool them? sacrifices? lie though. also definitely case Belgium. Vaccination centres ready go, receiving hundreds doses week. ""Bottom line: State federal rules didn’t force nursing homes accept COVID-positive patients, many believed 1.6% death rate, 2.5% hospitalization rate?

So 64% hospitalized dead?

Wtf, math broken something, can't believe numbers. Nobody said ok miss gym. makes happy every time see big event going ahead. vexes quite hard unhealthy lifestyle people going get vaccine first.  Thanks. don’t think doubt idea resistance, outright immunity, Covid due coronaviruses common. developed quickly.
[The Reality Coronavirus Vaccine \(w/Dr. Paul J&amp;J meeting tomorrow Bad news makes news companies money. Fuck them, care that, want know hug grandma worry infecting her. messaging needs come government, need better job explaining masks mitigations still needed even vaccinate people. Yup. fine. job. Given sacrifices people made pandemic pretty miniscule. office trying remember day closed went emails last year surreal reading messages leading it. week two prior, seeing ""business trips need VP-level approval"", ""we're monitoring what's going China offices"", ""as morning closing cafeteria"" later day ""we wfh 3/9 3/23"". remember telling direct reports figured we'd back office mid-May seemed like crazy long time, are... Someone created one CO. I’m sure industrious people states create similar things. read CO one r/Denver. Right period time possible substitute getting equipment. rest life. ""The first victim battle plan.""

That's point. Stay flexible look opportunities react real world experience perfectly conform presuppositions underpin plan. family 4 people NY week March 20th. Brother brought home school, slight fever, gave laid bed chills relentless cough week half. thought COVID getting test furthest mind then. Confirmed months later antibodies. Probably countless others like fam there. NEED equipment. luxury. absolutely live well without gym. spoiled privileged. whole idiotic situation caused completely incompetent politicians.
I hope people smart enough see utter stupidity.

Please research data coming UK currently. reality AZ vaccine effective similar better measured others.  Yea I’m done caring. Can’t live fear forever. Hate me, call hole, murderer, whatever. I’m waiting vaccine I’m 100% done caring period. new variants evade vaccine it. love good dramatic ..... pause. remember antibody test results NYC late April last year. Turned 25% city already then. Wouldn’t surprised number closer 40-50% now. think success, think people tend exaggerate badly went neighbouring countries exceptionally well. edit? added clause American oriented. agree you, think point wanted make even though people struggling still tens millions want spend money before. demand there.

The guy replied pessimistically implying small number people even able afford concerts plays would rather put every dollar business investments think case. It’s dumbest shit imo can’t actually quantify much time data want see. top order really see long term effects know likely won’t exist waited long enough vaccine won’t even necessary anymore. applying people's feelings expressed onto me.

The fact First World, matters Americans, United States *is* worst comes worker protections, _actually_ improved (they've improved lip service companies improved already top class _anyway_); and, since narrow topic discussion thread, that's I'm speaking about.

Now, we're going talk great United States national parks, good free speech benefits are, fact worry foreign invaders citizens military armed teeth makes one heck deterrent, great! that's topic here. topic worker protections.

Good us allow 9 year olds work labor camps 9 year olds _do_ work (actors), lots laws protecting them.

If topic discussion criminal justice, meaningless bring great cell service along major highways. like giving much info Southern California smaller city next big city.

So cost living cheap compared \~50 miles since could commute district offer competitive pay. already teacher shortages works favor bargaining.

My mortgage less used pay 2 bedroom apartment lived San Diego, house 1/3rd price would SD.

high wage+low cost living nice.

One great things $1000/mo plan Kaiser $0 copays/prescriptions covered employer pay dime towards it. (Not taken salary, included)

The highest paid teacher district makes \~200k/yr got like billion vaccines 30 seconds world focusing one common enemy. 

That’s pretty good books. It’s amazing actually. ignore part severe disease likely still prevented? spent two years get rid obesity, good going. 😞 take couple weeks full immunity kick in. complex vocab

hard believe world survived long absent population 100% enlightened souls like yourself. mindset keep shit perpetuating, maybe get sick die others will. ""done shit"". Well yeah. course did. start virus. Germany country many regarded beginning even one best handlings virus many times daily case count today time last year. look summer months Germany lock downs hundreds per day. Today 4900+.

&amp;#x200B;

You could also argue numbers lower march last year didnt enough tests go around.

&amp;#x200B;

I mean get putting perspective far long way go argument Im criticizing. sentiment. mean, realistic anywhere, okay. think splitting school multiple, disparate buildings connection beforehand less 3 months schooling feasible realistic, know tell you. want having. 


The possible solution take many precautions possible within schools themselves. Whether that's limiting students staff alternating days, repurposing certain rooms used instruction currently, and/or increasing sanitation practices. possible all, best case solution stay virtual summer, cases much lower everywhere. I’m know it’s going aggravate shit LAST WORD. flu necessarily dangerous children, one kind deal, cumulative effect. nearly bas adults, talking abut easy 5,000+ excess deaths (of people age 18) year reopen schools normally. we're talking 1-2 9/11s, buildings full children. I'm expert see could happen. virus going anywhere enough people vaccinated, least updated vaccines become available, happen. Half population protected infection, least, can't see SA variant overtaking UK one anytime soon. nationwide trend probably oriented weather. Cases under-reported several states. Georgia one them. Georgia also dramatic spike states (still spiked, dramatic). 

Super Bowl effect may there, Super Bowl ratings lowest they've 15 years think outside Tampa Kansas City much energy around it.  I'd say we're getting started since changed argument. would discuss merits methodology index article mentions calculated. 

I would read methodology first though. However, I'll say - I've never read single one country index rankings severely flawed methodology. 

I time moment maybe tonight read see seems sound   need brush logical fallacies.

""**if virus spreading""**

Your premise conclusion seem thing. sub clearly filled liberal arts majors. lmao mean ""available local MILFs area""? I’m PA too. Hope Wolf considering lifting restrictions soon decline keeps going. Theres basically two outcomes- one high vaccination rate produced true herd immunity new infections almost nonexistent, one vaccinate population callously disregard infections deaths people refusing it. EU went shopping bit everything probably good idea nobody knew mRNA vaccines would come market far ahead. EU also wanted suppliers taking liabillity - cost time delayed supplies. ok. bit everything show Q2 availabillity explode. EU get last jab similar timescale - Q2 makes difference, Q1.
UK bet one horse, luckily winner.
USA slapped exportban industy large enough supplied.
Agree seperate issue discussion - calles commision unelected bureaucrats, fair representation those. Vaccines work strengthening immune system making hard work beforehand properly trained encounter virus. would much useful actual singles ads. Okay 2mil day still...not great country 200 million adults, give take. again, great states like mine admittedly keeping 30% shipped doses cache. Like point want hopeful last year pandemic, everything predicted going wrong happened happened quickly, everything predicted going right far slow incompetent. road trip California Christmas week, 2019. started SF drove San Diego. Around New Year's, mom got BAD cold/flu. Like, knocked usually get sick, even flu. took day two felt better, cough would go away. 

When got home, around 5-6 days later, got fever bad cough. Dr. assumed mom walking pneumonia. diagnosed bronchitis. still wonder then. 

My mom sister got tested antibodies month two ago. sister 0. mom trace, dr. said either came contact it, get enough viral load...or ago wore off. 

I really know. I'd assume it, sister, slept room mom catch it?

Edited say 2019. forget nearly march ""new years"" ""Christmas week"" assumed past year. Yeah, it’s thing people do, doesn’t much COVID, doesn’t hurt either. surfactant (soap) degrades outer layer virus. need special disinfectant. Honestly would focus hand washing/ sanitizer.

Again, primarily airborne spread. Airflow, distancing, duration exposure, room occupancy, mask use way important. would ask dumbass question? idiot chance? observation airborne viruses harder time take precautions offending much think want steal freedom fuck people's lives fuck right off. actual site someone whose corporate email address hard people spell, thought promoting easier spelling, like made sense. set URL merely forwards main site. 

The main website set Boston Children's Hospital usually lists types vaccine information, right rededicated COVID vaccine. currently lists COVID-19 vaccine availability certain providers pharmacies Alaska, Tennessee, Indiana, Iowa, expects adding information states coming weeks. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Active shooters understand. Higher electricity bills part price reopening schools, need accept Dogshit messaging public health authorities governments. One thing we've learned pandemic people work behind scenes public health really know speak public sort confidence clarity. mistake doom         er...I wonder go crazy mrna vaccines cure everything winds softening immune system detriment? Never said did. Things definitely slow business consumer sides though. Right. Nowhere seen spike despite variants. might contagious modeling, hasn’t translated real world despite several months take off. expect good news come form may let sooner thought vs bad used be.

A subtle dramatically important distinction act. young people must confined another year least see mutations might do.  point govt trust blindly shown time throughout history criminals never held accountable. believe different delusional. Formula is: (Weight kg)/((length (in meters))²) = BMI kg/m²

so 75kg Person 1,80m bodylength (165lbs - 6ft) would BMI ~22.5 wich would ""normal weight""

Check here: thing though without something reopening plan, even talking freaking idea reopening, many people going get vaccine think matter anyways.

I think realize many people legitimately care getting virus, care getting life back. call people ignorant whatever exist. would rather hang home wife dog, go bar bunch anti-maskers.

Do people ever get tired using strawman? Think people fortunate enough live partner families. think people going sit home they're fully vaccinated? truth lot people care anymore they've spent year watching things get worse worse people caring enough. people exhausted self sacrificing watching Walmart flooded people completely unmasked dead winter nurses flying visit tourist locations. People slowly trickle stop giving shit disease, especially vaccinated. Wow age well. embarrassing. mean there's way less people get already caught so... Rectangle pizza tiny square pepperoni best crap ever. Honestly know terms contract, I'm sure companies want make it. also know europe's red tape harm good. thing know I'm tired listening politicians talking know understand sudden experts virus public health. way EU ""sold"" us vaccine talk sounds like huge lie. one stopping wearing face shields masks people honestly want mandated flu season rude awakening. finally. Me, trolling? Pot calling kettle black eh. 

You’ve posted opinion pieces words O’Toole. Call find legit sources (you can’t, you’re making stuff up). problem. love going museums. They're safe right they're open. like eating restaurants. They're open safe. love going Vegas watching people. That's safe right now. like seeing shows. That's safe. WTF supposed vacation right now? one wants keep lockdowns, makes sense. Politicians know unpopular hurts businesses, would used next election. literal conspiracy theorists spreading rumors. disagree, point end goal always lower risk level point threat mass death longer exists. push back people believe end goal eliminate Covid plant like Measels.

The flu us one hundred years Covid isn’t going anywhere. threat mass death eliminated though vaccinations point ready return normal life.

I’m sure what’re you’re talking regarding Trump stuff comments, there's ZERO reason suspect mom COVID - known exposures, positive test, symptoms. Further, there's harm unknowingly receives vaccine asymptomatic COVID, unlikely situation it. Loads people unknowingly presymptomatic COVID gotten vaccine, reports widespread issues. even bother get tested circumstances. must produced billions vaccines first batch vaccines produced Marburg site expected delivered April 2021.

Oh, April.  Sounds like much reason worry. known exposure, following guidelines, say healthy.... update numbers different delete post Gotcha. worries. 

I'm florida remember sanely everything going DeSantis til like mid April. really thought guy gonna handle well Trump said something economy over. Serious policy whiplash there. must produced like 0.01% vaccines. 

Impressed. Pretty sure NYT isn’t top culprit hysterical bullshit news. Hi Fox! I’m pretty sure station thinks I’m posting smoldering pile rubble right now. Can’t imagine anyone south ~deadly caravan ~ migrants heading them.

Half issue public fucking stupid lazy actually read past headline. turn personalities get opinions. sentiment too; it’s months since rolled US/worldwide millions vaccinated Pfizer Moderna shots don’t get anyone would still using excuse anymore. also qualify current tier/phase locally decided get done encourage anyone circle still worried. yet turn green sprout antennae manifest mutant powers second dose 7th. Yeah, view FL numbers huge amount skepticism, even take face value narrative FL significantly better states still false agree, irresponsible gyms open middle pandemic. must produced like 0.01% vaccines. 

Impressed. CDC still saying vaccine changes nothing

That false, CDC saying vaccine changes nothing. intentionally ignoring meaning statement. Immunized people continue wearing masks distancing know yet (although looking likely) spread *unimmunized* people. one suggesting two immunized people cannot gather. whole thing completely blown proportion. UK we're stuck lockdowns purely based fear. vulnerable vaccinated, small numbers outside elderly hospitalised let alone die. Time get life!! produce 2-3 mn doses per day India struggling jab 0.5 mn doses per day. \~10,000 sessions currently arranged per day target 100 vaccinations per session seems technical issues registration etc level vaccine hesitancy - barely achieving 30 sessions per day. top states holding vaccination sessions 4 days week average daily numbers even lower.

Thank you, genuinely interesting informative (despite dashboard appearing moment).

I know they're going 60+ 1st March know gave away Sri Lanka etc part sort vaccine diplomacy.

Either way, additional production administer (even scaling) that's truly win win. COVID tip iceberg big picture issues weighing general population. stated guidance think Democrat governors (who course restricting most), would consider listening take cue need reopening plan. I'm talking US. need children vaccinated go back normal, flu way dangerous children. elderly health issues vaccinated severe disease, hospitalizations, deaths plummet. moment Biontech Moderna doses markets outside US made EU far know. J&amp;J vaccine made EU well. EU export far, far vaccines import, getting number vaccines plants outside EU hardly described unfair.  ""Start date: Feb 2021. ""

Seems like already use. Thank you, didn’t know this. possible ELI5 they’re considered different strains share mutation..? moved bumfuck months before, living tiny studio. visit home working remotely, there. first long-distance ""relationship"" tanked within couple months last year. rough. go date night nice lol. Randomly found month old post, appreciate sympathy. miss regular human interaction :/ Twitter account TurboVax notified morning Javits Center NYC released around 7,500 appointments morning next couple weeks. Checked 20 minutes release still ton available. schedule appointment (technically I'm eligible virus month half ago I'm gonna hold bit) made happy see much availability. recall find article nursing homes taking Cuomo court regarding order. leads believe nursing homes thought could safely handle CV19 patients regular patients. thought otherwise, would sought injunction. know bad idea was, limited data back then.

What lie? Undercounting due poor methodology. Often, counting issues identified real time.

With said, federal investigation identify potential wrongdoings. I’m kind afraid I’m vaccinated (which won’t months still) I’m going feel guilty living regular life again. want travel again, previously living abroad working dream job want travel again. I’m going feel guilty hope I’m able enjoy exposure, mother old healthy, fear may without showing, that's i'm wondering vaccines safe someone covid, goes daily, wearing mask wash hands all, worry Nailed it! one thing, long covid thing poorly understood ""Let's go see God together!"" told good thing propose solutions along complaints might bring. did. fart's chance wind are, might good solution areas.

Do anything better contribute? It’s top 8 sites chrome lack natural immunity+people caring restrictions+lag vaccinations probably places spike cases fall elsewhere. totally agree. Fauci seems like super competent scientist leader he’s certainly journalist spokesperson, he’s kind become eyes public. He’s scientist first foremost shouldn’t responsible public imaging. Kids high risk group never been. Unlike you, much world ready normal taking steps get there. selfish. selfish expect people aren’t even risk put massive portion fleeting lives hold. Yes, need incentivize vaccine special privileges, however, hard prove someone vaccinated. LOT disingenuous people straight lie vaccinated everywhere go everyone know get special privileges. long people make large portion population, cannot allow things warranted.

Pretty much, story able reduce deaths 500k instead 50k, many assholes care lives inconvenienced welfare country people live here. story Fauci initially stated people buy masks. certain group people play well informed.

This much push mandatory vaccines vaccine identification cards, otherwise need wait around 75% 90% immunization start lifting restrictions. bit like poverty porn, people like suffering porn. couldnt keep people screwing circuit area I’m shocked masks either git second shot last week. Since June tested weekly basis. tested since 2 weeks first shot. know annectdotal aligns point. part weekly routine months. I'm like need   Almost like Pfizer Moderna American companies would make sense would focus home country first. 


Pretty sure Sinovac China administered China country, complain that? one point UK pretty much overrun brink collapse, many states. reasonable call close schools evidence showed keeping schools open actually driving pandemic. damn morning brain read 'want pay apple sauce' like well that's weirs least something.  Billy Gates said 4 vaccines? seems obnoxiously excessive Media across world stirring pot entire pandemic. Younger generations tend better ability recognize misleading news, lot people still take tabloids face value. co-workers get sick covid, would definitely teach employer lesson give people paid time test positive nice co-workers recommend this. speak here, would receptive masks general rhetoric turn shaming turn masks symbol much care. wear mask, get wrong, shaming people wearing masks outside, example, turn sit well me. Ok, antibodies go time. protection would last less time, right?  cheering 2000 people stadium I'm pretty sure lost plot..

Re fuck open, soon. Vietnam whole pandemic shit figured out. normal 2/3 since beginning longer.  know Reddit all, half people problems social interactions, facial expressions huge part that. able smile let others know going normal human interactions. Also lot people mumble, mask makes worse. yeah, I'm 100 percent convinced effective people think is. everyone wearing cloth masks told, really wanted work needed surgical mask cloth mask. Yeah well fuck it, states mask mandate expires next week, probably get renewed, April half people given masks together here. standard explanation insufficient diversity test group. whatever reason want use, FDA like foreign trials. Want examples? people legitimate non-conspiracy-based reasons getting vaccine. Wow, no, that's accurate all. experts say vaccine slightly less effective variants. 100% 0% proposition, no, ""pick one"". Future variants could become better evading vaccines, happened yet. Pfizer American company. Israel US colony. Theres answer. Lol, young people sacrificed time, Old people allowed travel world young people must stay socially distant...  can't again. I’m really curious verdict schools come May/June real data taken True, see effect believe Texas last vaccines administered per capita. 


But vast majority states, cases going that’s super promising haven’t doses sooner. It’s still scramble get vaccinated many people. anyone give single fuck cases spike? shut everything stop cases, keep hospitals getting overrun.

The vaccines stop even variants.


So fuck would keep everything closed? Jeez news piece gloom doom. lockdown rest life quarantine every strain emerges sharing many pieces equipment. Tonight Unsolved Mysteries Fun fact .Once mask becomes wet sweat etc doesn’t filter anything.  Try viewpoint covid19. 

Travel opportunity :(  Perhaps k-shaped recovery meant also lot people financially better year ago

I would expect NYC arts culture scene rebound rather quickly widespread vaccination many people died covid vs many people died vaccine side effect? Choice seems pretty clear selected presumably high risk. Ventilation known key factor preventing transmission months months, it’s frustrating it’s getting traction public eye. lot energy trust jeopardized mistaken fixation hand sanitizer early on. goal stop spread virus IFR 1% overall, *well* 1% people working age, *microscopically small* school- college-aged kids, flushing year plus education toilet millions casually ignoring sorts massive secondary mental health social effects kids we’ll dealing years, yes, closing schools one way that. Well, one even less effective, less effective - new vaccine protects Brazil/SA 95%+ offers protection strains currently know about, update manufacturing new strain?

Two, practice - we've seen strains emerge concerning, Moderna smart start figuring make boosters variants today process faster optimized. See also long took get current vaccines done, approved, mass produced (they STILL ramping up). 


Three, they're testing things, like giving half vaccine quantity effective - could literally use half vaccine, could vaccinate ton people much quickly. They're even testing third dose later current vaccine protects well variants boosting antibodies. word, science.

Four, money stock market. market responds growth potential anything, there's lots fear variants, combine two announce ""We're - solution problem!""

Basically, there's zero reason to. Remember Moderna never approved product doubt whether ever would. they're huge portion vaccinations US globally - market them. like Pfizer J&amp;J billions dollars products - Moderna right basically R&amp;D outfit IP produced great vaccine COVID - little more. need path forward. We'll see federalstateministers want open matter incidence number Sure, there's great argument surviving business going make profits summer seen years.

The problem lot places need reopen. Sure may closed minimize costs, haven't. a) lot safer majority people vaccinated.

b) Sounds like risk categories. avoiding high risks infection (a) true.  hand, people much less money spend going concerts stuff, rest economy suffered too, resulting many losing jobs income. let's forget many artists - especially musicians - give profession too. logistics challenge, medical one. 

Exactly. Canada military's Major-General charge federal distribution reason. least company work made policy cannot vacation days rolled paid out. least without good reasoning approval many levels. I've seen managers make exceptions let employees roll book circumstances warranted. time pay common employee laid get paid prorated vacation days taken point. send bunch stuff claiming safe, go back check, turns mostly unenforced pr stuff. happened twice. using precise numbers precise data lying?

It's global pandemic, numbers always bit sloppy. think people understand viral infections, let alone Covid. grew modern healthcare amazing vaccination infrastructure us understanding nasty viral infection be. look death rate, think trivial. Typical one-step thinking humans expert of.

Not even asking certain Asian countries took so, seriously kept numbers low matter cost. smart using AZ vaccine elderly  Folks - previously type 2 diabetes selected randomly get moderna vaccine, still get wait vaccine proven effective side effects? post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

There risk transmitting something v year around Gyms one earliest identified super spreader sites South Korea outbreak last year. Dude finish line shifted like 4 times goddam month. Find actual end point we'll talk. yet already exceptions allowing travel various people, vast majority vaccinated.  18 year old, risk covid literally less risk flu, less people age range died covid flu 2019-2020 flu season. drive past chain gym near daily absolutely packed matter time drive past. got see windows there's people crammed inside, masks, breathing heavily other. pay go there.  vaccine deliveries \[snip\] forecasted.

No can't. work health care. reality find thursdays getting vaccines next week. clusterfuck. minute actually think that. set people protected ever going covid. Yet answer still masks distancing want chance become potential serial killer. planet make sense?

Agreed I’ve asking thing.

I get continued measures public good chunk people yet vaccinated come on. 

If it’s safe room 100% fully vaccinated population ever get back normal? It’s literally best case scenario somehow it’s still good enough. BINGO. went small outdoor shower. got much shit it. inside grocery store since March. Target like three times last year clear mind pick things ran of. mention fact literally baby right lockdown support essential work husband working insane hours. Yes, went shower...It felt good suicidal thought head bit. graduate teaching assistant. take graduate classes online via Microsoft Teams classes teach required meet lot miss there. inconsistent childcare (provided vaccinated family members consist mom inlaws can) due pandemic trying keep baby safe. Zoom/ Face time replacement. Sorry. not. students rough time accepting fact last year high school awful first maybe second year college too. heard things students can't unhear. Colleges need something, know university work ANYTHING tangible help kids outside wellness call get notices ""we unable reach student. assume fine"".

I mention lost family member due Covid. know risks well aware never get family member back. However, mental health crisis young. narrative general public can't something keep going edge awful. agree, giant keggers (a students got Cvoid this...no joke) need take step back judge.  hard believe one year, people still understand point ""flattening curve"" think question *personal* risk.

Yet, us understand continue wear masks little longer, get vaccinated early possible, avoid indoor shared air anytime can.

And, so, we'll continue cover don't, herd sense. Even cases deaths drop, drop faster thanks everyone who's willing take measures. hope true. 

Just note last week Texas combination 1) difficulty testing due weather could skew numbers 2) weather-imposed quarantine, ironically could slowed virus Forget it, helmet. article mention variants. covers overall cases. That’s happening country. People need end day gets harder, day less support, day makes realize anyone gets work home fucking care you. Again, feel ""in together"" anyone wants continue. want continue, harmed enough get picture yet. 

Of course going see Lockdowns complaints, people wanting Lockdown forever objectively sick head...no one WANTS this.

And there's exit strategy, parameters constantly change? acting like virus end humanity here? scientific minds fucking dumb actually figure reopen safely? first pandemic we've had, yet first one listen asshats like Osterholm talk much need distance undisclosed amounts time. 

But again, I'm unreasonable...I understand need, understand people want cautious feel need personally attack anyone brings needs end soon...the privilege required mind boggling. 

My entire original comment I'm glad rest us starting nut push back pro-lockdown abuse assholes already hurt this.  exactly deep cleaning work? spray scrub surfaces much want, nothing airborne virus. cube ventilation system circulate air without spreading rest gym? Hell yeah idea, imagine purpose. 18 months fall 2022. There’s way restrictions still Dude go fuck outside something.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Go get ‘em. That’s point. Hopefully months mask Piggly Wiggly optional. really make comparison? blame facebook large part post-truth world. Masks actually make easier breathe outside winter. keep air humid around mouth nose. ""I can't wear mask"" crowd 99.99% full shit. would need get banned? Fauci literally said masking restrictions well 2022 even population vaccinated. Listen science. see that. It’s irrational. recognize tragedy want life back time. doesn’t make anybody bad person. one totally unhelpful ideas come this: many assumed worst intentions every little action. 
We’re rubbing gravel hair rest lives. we. come back. Nobody wants live like this. Florida, majority people carrying like nothing even happening. speaks unnatural life is. people would rather risk it. Businesses 100% open, nothing stop going out. 

When NY reopens businesses 100% (I’m suggesting should, I’m saying do), people flood things. 

Believe it. Well guess ""choice"" normal sense. guess certain sites different vaccines due storage requirements. J&amp;J likely used places without freezers traveling vaccination efforts. likely call around see offering.... ask vaccine 2 doses. Either way I'll whatever avoid J&amp;J. little plastic soldiers manufactured GW, give look vassal 40k. Lose face face, keep game flowing. used past friends play long distances. Entirely depends country. work gym doesn’t shock me. Even though state requires masks, ongoing fight get members keep on. One guy literally pulled day bench press. ones keep leave nose hanging boss doesn’t want lose members strict ignores You’ll look countries rules. one different. US embassy information believe Oh boy, guess we’re crying now. going gym since opened august, west mask, 0 problems. vaccine give even less shit. kind doubt - there's lot pent demand wear mask everywhere. makes think I’m anti-mask? I’m pointing masks suck, saying shouldn’t wear them. believe EU either. Could someone explain Israel new cases arent declining significantly lockdown high rate vaccination? know vaccine making hospitalizations dropping fast worried doesnt slow rate transmission. guarantee variant April 2020 New York worse majority new variants true, hospitals medical clinics enacting super strict guidelines limiting elective surgeries. bread butter taking strict measures know cases surge can’t elective surgeries profits plummet. Even wide open states decided won’t sacrifice economy, hospitals taking super strict measures. would ‘flu’? stop testing, would less cases? Problem solved!

/s Yes, are... it’s car get set rules. want wear mask sombrero cowboy boots call uber. Haha, new 2 weeks. Yeah, we'll see. even NUMBERS pre-print regards contagiousness fatality lol. figures mention makeup cases. purely speculative.

!Remind 2 weeks vaccines still technically trail periods approved emergency. still need officially approved maybe controls US powering huge decline cases experiencing?
None makes sense me. media coverage frankly stupid, contradictory, confusing. Scientists even seem understand what's happening. I'm sick ""information fog"" seems surround entire pandemic. Ventilation cuts profits revenue. Sanitizer employees pockets. mean million doses AZ lying around one seems want. Money printer go brrrrrrrrr Good him! choice go. Get it. employees families feed. Interesting previous studies showed exact opposite (almost gym spread).

I’m betting it’s super spreaders mess everyone. gym wear mask wipe everything down. doesn’t stop people lowering mask talk people (wtf??, like you’re super hard set, ok, lower talk???). people don’t wipe anything. Usually they’re person.

The worst though people don’t give shit fever feel awful. 

I get working makes feel better, home workout fucks sake. workout lot, spend lot time thinking dieting on. sure hell feel awful I’m home workout resting. way I’m exposing people crap it. important find right gym. gym, enforce mask wearing upgraded ventilation system. switched expensive gym COVID hit, paying extra $ worth avoid COVID. also wear KN-95 working extra protection. way screwed vaccine procurement unrivaled developed world.

But underlying problems around long time, see serious attempts addressing them.

For one, Commission far removed accountable people, group bureaucrats installed national governments.

Another problem, likely harder overcome, EU simply united yet. Apparently French pushing hard go all-in Sanofi vaccine, like BioNTech's product mainly German.

They need lot accountability transparency. probably trying get people use earlier spread out. company last year try avoid everyone taking entire month December off. certain percentage...is percentage, medical opinion, higher 0 percent percentage get mask? ""It's many tests means many cases recorded.""

That 100% false. everyone tested 2 years ago we'd 0 cases recorded.

You used similar death counts evidence higher infection noted. naive. survival rate changed drastically. Thank reply! Tried posting question r/covid19 using impersonal description ( person 1 / person 2) unfortunately resulted temporary ban 😫 hopefully someone insights🤞 Fucking unreal 2,000 people still dying every single day. two weeks turns science variant real, hubbub pre print irrelevant. Yeah fuck place stop giving money Yes, wearing mask overreacting. wonder many people refuse J&amp;J due lower efficacy concerns NY steady... let's open theaters.  Okay, Moderna vaccine. see sub articles Pfizer. concentrating Pfizer right now? solution without vaccines lockdowns restrictions delay inevitable? Optimism good news useless. need know what's wrong going. We're state alert. Good news nothing inform need informed anything.

Society soft point think fragile minds can't handle constant bad news need good news balance get depressed :(. Imagine living real shit like ancestors did. Right? getting **ridiculous.** fucking say it: ""If vaccinated, safe others."" many studies need? crazy. hard Fauci even admit yes, able see grandmother **both** vaccinated. WTF?! presser *he said* studies seem indicate vaccinated individuals unlikely spread virus. frustrating. discuss someone new? literally things every day, 7 days week.

""So, lockdowns?"" new ""How weather?"" Please tell you’re trolling. Kids aren’t made better isolation, humans incredibly social animals. primates suffer greatly isolated. 

Besides, humanity never improved old struggles war poverty. harmed killed off. COVID less deadly teens wave mental illness due deprivation interaction. 40% Israeli adult population plus children still vaccinated, means even approaching herd immunity. guess people get vaccine R° start drop get closer herd immunity territory. It’s relieving see much good news sub days. 2020 difficult year everyone, especially healthcare workers lost loved ones. I’m remaining cautiously optimistic, looks like course good summer. LA winter surge like much country. receded now, like much country. experts talking wave March (now pushed back April, May, well, that's point.) supposed worried imported variants. I'm reading, CA already local variant. NYC too. SO. questioning, is, narrative facing 3rd wave March/April/May (June? July? etc) B117. narrative lot press last month. would expect see sign now. not. Counts across country, steeply. That's I've saying too. Anyone buying distancing rn sames extremely shortsighted. Like get last summer hard distance facing prospect thing could last years. literslly 3 months away social gatherings safe again. everyone hold much longer, there. I'm burnt depressed next guy, come people, 90 days, let's keep fighting wild times Summer. really contract tracing, we'll never know. Sure, clusters sometimes transmission traced, vast majority people US catch covid idea caught it. Imagine told people ""while airplanes mostly safe, still crash. Therefore, avoid air travel come 100% safe method flying."" many gyms area California open outdoors (parking lots, outdoor basketball courts, open parking garages) masks required. people wear masks pretty good cleaning equipment use. company, fairly generous vacation time US company (most people 4 weeks) addition lots holidays (including extra week Christmas).

By mid November starts lot less people online every day. think UK timeline optimistic, I'm hoping achieve Johnson outlined mid July. Fingers crossed good luck! muscle gym briefly reopened last year went one wearing mask 8-10 regulars 10 tourists there. soon allow taking reason pretty fast slope little useage. must expulsion anyone wearing mask time, even muscle ups flipping tires. Bob check Starlink available house. mean, seems like lots folks India don’t currently want either, so... [ya course NYT chicken little comment posted said masks work. Brazil isolated pocket together Peru Ecuador living third wave (or extended large second wave Brazil since December last year, drived mutation). highest deaths since beggining pandemic 55k cases per day now, growing time new ""lockdowns"", others states fully reopening, including schools, close health system goes full capacity.

 planning anything new wave, counting slow vaccination enough drive virus away. able go restaurant, gym movie theatre California since March. fuck talking about? Funny lockdown work, always bevause ""people even follow it"". Religious thinking I'm glad wear mask correctly, keep mind wearing right others around aren't, one serious risk. Even wearing n95, indoors even 20 min several incorrectly masked people exhaling grunting heavily, much risk, especially AC going vents fans going, gyms have. makes possible someone across gym covid infect particles picked fan blown across room. I'm pulling ass, proven.

I know fitness important you, likely fine get covid, seeing covid like 2/3rds asymptomatic people's lungs (glass lung, precursor copd) hearts, really hope consider trying skip gym find way make work home. may amazing gym fancy equipment months, functioning lungs healthy heart least. DSL? Lucky! Bob still dial up! school board literally decided teachers aren’t allowed open windows. time alive. Holy Moly Wow that's actually really smart idea “Pls stop science it’s mean :(“  Imagine working vulnerable group, thousands died tragic deaths, refusing get vaccine would protect them. quit job. Heartless pieces shit. feel attacked That’s did. figured woks two years thing got better, took gym money put towards home equip.

I know everyone space that, fortunate. even saying? let infect everybody Manaus/SA situation virus finds escape mutation starts reinfecting people. Eventually virus would run easy mutations would reach true herd immunity would take much longer think.   I'm Dutch I'd gladly take vaccine get. vaccine greatly reduces chance death hospitalisation sounds great me. I'll go booster soon available refuse great risk reduction meantime sounds silly me. Don’t shame people either. It’s place actually thing excess caution. much caution respect one threat increase problems threats. probably gym dependent. going back gym since vaccinated last month. Every single person employee wears mask. working changing room well. gym don’t know what’s going elsewhere. Looking count B117 cases US
Doesn't show doubling anything like that, shows steep decline
I'm trolling downplaying risk; I'm trying reconcile data seem support experts saying.
We hear CA variant, NYC well. maybe B117 imports really important US, self-made trends? mid 20s, agree mental gymnastics friends wild. friends say they're precautions lockdowns large social circles. They'll talk Covid agree social distancing, post Insta stories board game night eating restaurant members several households. get it. actually beleive living standards suggesting, suggesting standards appear empathetic dying, deep actually care enough change behavior superficial level?

I guess maybe people used prolific social lives weekly things households feels like they're contributing? Hahaha, good joke! Pretending attempt making policies based science year ago. way I’m wearing mask I’m exercising. Kiss ass. Good taking care yourself. Ignore haters mean specifically regards vaccines? doctor said information observed analyzing data people received Pfizer, sure published independent study yet, quite lot articles newspaper quotung doctors working field (this first google result ) state live in? Even though Cuomo complete ass, pretty well outlined certain numbers hit phases continue reeled in. agree, paid news sites produce decent quality stuff. high enough budget priority pay yet, want high quality news future, know I'll get   I’ll honest here. Coming working covid YEAR straight healthcare worker, despise “good news” media coverage virus. makes us groan pull hair out. reasons.

The biggest reason? We’ve much disinformation spread news many false starts premature declarations “the end” pandemic, feel reporting positive progress almost certainly instantly results equally negative spike later on. first question get people patients always “So mean don’t wear mask anymore?” statement: “I’m excited plan big get together everyone I’ve missed” 

Currently, 15% state California vaccinated that’s including people received one dose. Experts say 85% citizens vaccinated order pandemic controlled. context, 51% citizens get flu vaccine. Even 85% citizens vaccinated, must maintain level precautions we’ve successfully created vaccine boosters sustain immunity protect new variants.

When California first closed cases healthcare system overwhelmed April 2020, daily new case average 1,500. Even deadly spike November-January ended, daily new case average week 6,218. That’s FOUR times higher first went state emergency lock down. honestly believe due statistical fatigue. Yeah numbers drastically better. They’re also several times higher pandemic first began. 

California closed reopened so. many. times. it’s gotten worse every time. Positive reinforcement great all, experience, seen taken responsibly. 

Also, don’t believe many people aware, time covid statistics improve, LOSE significant amount resources need maintain advance improvement “there’s need, demand down.” includes reopening counties, closing alternative care sites, reducing emergency healthcare worker staffing, closing testing sites, losing federal state supply aids, losing federal state funding. Prematurely. 

Positive Covid news almost ALWAYS trashes hard work progress drives us mad. We’re negative nancies want miserable, we’re saying it’s better since began. It’s worse. It’s over. Stop letting guard down. enough improvement reason celebrate right lot us won’t celebrate it’s actually over. We’ve worked long seen many people die. 

End rant. Good morning. emphasis ""March"", in, March, 2020 every time mentioned illness said ""novel"" virus knee nothing about. people knowledge created change. quit lies move constructive change? stuff outdated, weak trumpian. Move on. bit relaxing. I’ve gone literally almost every day since reopened June last year gotten it. Granted make every effort keep distance people keep mask on. know grandmas nursing home residents declining vaccination. Smh

As well 50% staff declining vaccination. read article baseless hot take? bashing actually coming scientists... UK want UK residents traveling domestically summer, I'm sure they'll open foreign travel five months. utterly terrifying live planet people like you.  thing misinformation it’s one difficult things stop now, don’t think it’s ever going go away. comes media companies people social media riding trends trying gain social monetary capital. terms timeline, would satisfied end point UK’s timeline since state others US lax moment could see could move forward. June 21st date, would need open businesses without most/any capacity restrictions though, except larger ones maybe, schools would need go back full person schedule options people can’t that. think even people tired could handle masks June small businesses students could handle online/hybrid schedules capacity limits long. it’s metrics? Covid risk goes normal flu levels, mainly based hospitalizations. Children literal 1 million chance dying COVID. absolutely vaccinated it’s turn, it’s unreasonable expect distancing masking measures continue get children vaccinated too. get adults done that’s that. Okay, show studies contact traces done indicate gyms unsafe, compared almost anywhere else. There's going one-off outbreaks gathering area, there's evidence gyms consistent proponent spread, u less course prove otherwise. 

I always find people saying 'suck up' 'work home' gym dilemma work much/enough huge part lives. Remove passions life abruptly see goes. 

I'm 24, can't afford go spend $5,000 quality gym equipment, Redditors workout say ""JuSt GeT 2 DuMbBeLLs GeT RunNiNg!""

I fail see compare bars restaurants. can't wear mask bar restaurant. people gym wear masks. 

You conceded contact tracing useless used previous argument....

Thanks!  presented evidence absolutely demonstrably false claim, first instinct attack source, spew partisan propaganda? Ok. think we're done here. reddit lives fantasy world. make case net result many discouraged getting vaccines now.

It's gone completely tits-up Germany bogus news article AstraZeneca vaccine useless old people.

A lot people, especially older ones, leery genetic engineering, exactly queuing vaccines. think one wanted useless, refusing it… Ehh, it’s special case. Equipment repair, 2-3 man teams, gotta make someone fly state less two, uncertain schedule, etc. one likes spending full day traveling Jim decided take week knew we’d pushing 60hrs week anyway.

For office work project deadlines terms weeks months though, yeah totally. wife get second shot tomorrow. 

In two weeks I’m going bar getting wings. Looks likes new variant town. head new variant South Africa don’t know NYC variant same. Also existing vaccines effective emerging variants don’t know one. anyone heard link, I’m mobile right now. someone Florida, reports fake statistics greatly exagerated, flat made up. would make numbers still highest country? Makes sense Obviously I’m talking work variant. hard comprehend? media printing stories researchers still finishing work.

Maybe don’t mind half-assed scare tactics backed published research. don’t think basis news. know gym judgement free zone

If going Planet Fitness, that's part problem Vaccine passports seem super unnecessary me. try use everyone gets vaccinated that’s pretty clear discrimination, everyone chance get vaccinated shouldn’t needed anymore. waste money developing could work make irrelevant instead? younger adults tend experiense intense symptoms second dose, interpreted older adults tend experiense less intense symptoms second dose.

Less severe relative younger adults. that's aggregate individual level.

And article hammered home second dose usually worse first dose. fact father really bad first dose demonstrates **really** gotten second dose since second one usually older adult, expected experience intense symptoms second dose based emphirical experience doctors far.

Source? Like actual source credible data back up. Texan I’ve wondering too... like relatively high distribution rate % people vaccinated last. thing come Texas one youngest states terms average age maybe that’s get less?  decade prior licensing measles vaccine, 400-500 people U.S. died every year it. bit there. death rate used much higher hundred years ago advances medicine greatly reduced long vaccine ever came out. numbers spike restrictions added again.

Good reporting. It’s hard enough communities get vaccinated. city could Spanish speakers facility basic negligence. 

DeBlasio’s people know better. say blamed, say taking credit. exactly surprise, considering many vaccinations mandatory school enrollment. read, last days, school board windows nailed shut teachers opening them? told would provide personalized letter company prove work essential industry company provide appointment booked. Seems incredibly easy fake. Yup! huge mice problem open doors windows. school next field like find way winter. That's said elsewhere. **If live area longer mandates masks, *please continue wear masks anyway, vaccinated.*** Otherwise, putting risk COVID-19. something's required anymore mean stop it. US maybe Canada even dependent supply AZ? US enough add Pfizer, Moderna, probably J&amp;J. sure AZ brings table point. Gunshot wounds considered vaccine related don’t think comparing case numbers start (when testing capacity limited) case numbers (much higher testing capacity) effective measure spread virus. vast minority this. 

I not, public messaging always contains words like ""may, could, likely, unlikely. Watch read weather reports serious weather events like hurricanes tornadoes wildfires, provide details nuanced information never absolutes. 

Think this, get plane kid. kid says scared, 1) explain planes safe 2) say impossible plane crash. pick 2 kid asks go safety video beginning flight showing plane landing water liferafts exit doors lose credibility. assure plane safe lied? working people make ""culture people proving dedication showing work school coughing sneezing"". need change capitalism works, need change rich people think. one going that. look me, I’m downvoted too. I’m trying speak logic, it’s kind hard argue it.  related headline? Really prove disprove anything, considering many different measures involved Stay home you’re sick maybe? little vaccinations happening Canada. Canada going months behind US point. likely lose another year events gatherings. federal government really cocked vaccine rollout. They're ranked like 50th world vaccines administered per capita. Alex - sell 50% product one report? Remember hospital ship sat empty NYC. true though, several sheriff's disobeyed Newsoms orders. I'm even sure that's controversial. That's fact. Trump

no Gotcha - never sure sub. plan continue even you’re vaccinated? I’d interested see impact weather cases. People stuck home, yes, you’ll also people confined others way otherwise would (ie warming centers). personally spent time indoors restaurants close others storm past year, limited restaurants open access warm space hot meal. least Houston, restaurants open downtown last week Tuesday/Wednesday packed brim. think time approved widely available students well next school year pandemic effectively US. I'd guess schools want dodge political firestorm requiring vaccine children immediately first approved disease particularly deadly. states exemptions vaccine requirements is. Yep, 99.8% us would left alive. Imagine selfish needlessly endanger people like that. man. need soul. Yeah, never gonna happen. announce harsh measures taken, slap ban import companies continue searching cheap supplier whuch hotspot media. Money people, always been. 
Anyway, every pharmaceutical company major scandal recent years (like paid say sugar fine fat bad), sceptical towards medication prescribed, antibodies count lack reaction vaccine, continue every three months monitor behaving.   situation yet positive. ramping vaccine deliveries whole month February. people feel vaccine passports travel throughout Europe again?

In UK we're due jabs June / July. also 10 days booked Bavaria end September (which cancel need be) go Oktoberfest Munich. thought sitting huge tent drinking beer litre tens thousands strangers honestly sounds euphoric last year we've had. think 100% compliance possible though. Certain jobs essential, people can't also hide home like rest us. Same, lot people know keep sentiment I'll wait months see.

I qualified recently loosening guidelines state got shot questions asked need fill consent form arrive. Unfortunately I’m phone paywalling 2nd article. Sorry


I disagree masking distancing always health care capacity. Yes part it, also decreasing spread disease. Especially close getting people vaccinated. Every death (3,200 yesterday) going preventable get enough vaccinations. can’t act like everything back normal 10% population vaccinated. covid deaths worse summer. 

From personal standpoint got vaccinated dec/jan. still wear mask seeing patients stores. 1/20 100%, would feel horrible got one patients sick. going see parents also vaccinated weeks. ok going wear mask low risk combined low risk them. think problem right lot people haven’t gotten vaccine low risk one side equation perfect. expectation things lot better July. 

I think thing may agreeing timing returning normal. Yeah. We’ve known coronavirus contagious, super surprising measures crushed flu. course makes conspiracy-minded people think something amiss even though makes perfect sense, validated labs showing dramatically fewer flu cases. useless Emphasis ""next year"" data coming this. know, it’s crazy tech started way train immune system fight cancer. Hopefully big boost mRNA research bringing us lot closer goal. Almost like Pfizer Moderna American companies would make sense would focus home country first. 

And yet talk banning companies dealing hostile foreign powers national interest suddenly ""It matter country company operating in, free want!!""

Pole dance :) receiving second vax, u/Pep3 suggested: money. House payments, health insurance, car insurance, food--the usual. Nope seems show vaccinated individuals spread disease. I’m actually hopping plane next week visit old friend, plan visit favorite brewery weekend first time year, yeah lifestyle changed point don’t desire partake lot pre-pandemic activities. banned plastic bags straws. takes one video endangered sea turtle choking discarded mask bans coming too. could certainly normalize wearing masks one sick, ending culture people proving dedication showing work school coughing sneezing.

All Dayquil commercials showed people deathly ill, working side side coworkers hours later got go. Try $120 planet fitness membership. Among lowest comes excess mortality, actually... Comparing us countries dishonest best considering many doses we’re hoarding. 

It’s two months less 14% population received one jab. That’s “going extremely well”. Yeah didn’t self-isolate, lied ran media sympathy justly got roasted social media. NYT making martyr case evidence “Canadians aren’t nice” complete drivel lazy reporting. subset people love excuse continue loser ass existence blame Covid. take away excuse, left disappointing look mirror... fact stimulus checks involved and/or unemployment benefits extended sweetens pot.

And someone believed science, masked day 1, limits unnecessary travel, continues socially distance. 1 year old seen grandparents person respect situation. piss moral high ground bullshit. do? idiot charge cdc said mask better vaccine. Fachici said need wear mask. said things make sense. Similarly Connecticut sticking age based tiers logistically makes sense. Age strongest predictor easiest confirm scheduling. 

All yellow tape vague definitions essential workers preexisting conditions slows vaccine rollout. mention including essential workers preexisting conditions like obesity, diabetes hypertension captures majority population anyway would overwhelm system. research like. didn’t mean literally. Obviously I’ve places like grocery store, office I’m needed, etc. yes spend lot time house. vast minority this. Almost one wants sort answer. engineering background certainly donot.

He's even giving odds allow ""nuance ambiguity"". something 95% say yes, flat out. sound excited this. problem? Group fitness sure. 

Individuals working socially distancing proven safe. 

My gym 11,000 sqft averages 100 people 5am-11pm. normally 1000sqft per person. it’s pretty low risk.  Sometimes people sign trials representative sample population. 

This good confirmation trial data. Dumb question -what’s pole class? Doom! set people protected ever going covid.

Not necessarily. Protection comes immunity may amount virus circulating society - probabilities game. 

I would agree though person New Zealand gets vaccinated protected ever going be.  expect time reach younger age brackets it'll open season anyway thanks increased vaccine production/delivery meta preventative measure discourage people eating cafeteria filing lawsuit get sick. studied using online resources library got 1480 sure keep making excuses laziness Nothing aggravating me. know reality situation find actually pretty comical privileged obnoxious comments are. Like poor you, can't go gym. Gosh, must amazing life actually complaining that. Cry river. according CEO I'd say perfectly cromulent. ... anyone thinks would actually end three weeks, nice bridge sale know assume lot gym goers know this, could give two shiets massive spreaders whatnot. going gym wearing mask regardless Please read comment again. clearly read understand it. yea, that's going happen. Fauci co conservative disappoint, get enough people vaccinated everyone going want things reopen, myself, state federal government included. point we're close. think vaccine, able go live life. point people country people don't, people still talking going gym give damn anymore restrictions lifted now. less 15% country vaccinated. messaging I've heard Fauci vaccines solution. numbers started decline recently. number deaths still pretty horrifying. doctor told quit eating much junk food. want hear that, exactly needed hear. got stick little bit longer, time give fight. putting ""gym"" ""healthy fit"" sentence. need go together. healthy fit without gym. that's talking go discuss doctor. tell optimal thing eat healthy light/moderate cardio strength training. doctors would actually advise heavy lifting intense workouts lot people talking about. 100% NEED gym. ""need"" restaurant eat good cook. 

Congrats contributing spread covid. obviously know little nothing it. 1%, spreading others. Selfish people like care freedoms people. 

And lastly, 1% bullshit. Long covid big deal impacted large percentage population. absolutely survive long term chronic symptoms. know someone personally impacted this. many others /r/covidlonghaulers and/r/covid19positive can't even work due mild case covid left debilitating symptoms. 

You clueless. never got tested flu covid antibodies honestly wouldn’t know. Covid blew like 1 month better yea favorite thing threads every second day like “is anyone, anyone still careful? feel like I’m one!” Like course you’re fucking one, lot people virtue signal online much guys.

You’re seeing people still staying home wow, they’re HOME! also said maybe 90 120 days things COMPLETELY normal....right? That's ""They heroes!"" manipulative propaganda passes underlined meaning suffering, hard working even possibility dying acceptable ""that heroes do"". 

What **should** protective gear working security measures need, along extra pay , vacations professional emotional support.

Instead feeding martyr bs propaganda energy spent secure front line. well know heroes, praise deserve fighting rights passing idea sacrifices acceptable.

 I'm sorry mispronounced english, first language also rant, frustrated person become doctor that's one reason get personal defending medical staff. That's one took back October. Good stuff. teach private? Mater Dei Jordan high. point suggest going gym getting drunk equivalent? Clearly not.

The point, make simple you, case choosing consider consequences others.  Found link me, feels like we've become programmed think ""well, next?"" told ""two weeks flatten curve"" last year. Two weeks became 4 weeks; became 2 months; became 6 months. multiple waves. 

Any time we've started feel comfortable, we've told ""don't get comfortable, fall bad"" ""there's gonna dark winter"" we're told ""well, even vaccinated risk."" 

That could take mental toll people. We're constantly questioning good news wondering dark side is. Rather researching validity negative headlines, we're accepting status quo and, instead, questioning positive ones wondering downside good news. love mask mandates, wear masks without looking like weirdos are. everyone else stops wearing masks feel like well, hoping never happens. still remember first Donald McNeil Jr. Feb episode like harbringer. DC prove condition, self attest. I'm sure people lie, gets shots arms, I'm ok it. also help people conditions, health insurance/money doctor's visit get proof. need vaccinate 80% population instead 70%. 

But matter. means end, small amounts hospitalizations deaths. got stayed tomorrow, get stay May 15th, matter: *that's* goal. 

Obviously vaccinations get there, need looking exact percentages all. look results it. Since hug people? proven time time prolonged exposure indoors causes get viral load large enough virus propagate, nonsense washing hands hugging still pushed? virus air thats spreads fast, short term exposure minimal risk, takes 5 10 minutes continuous exposure virus air breathing effective infections New York Times coverage past ~month freaking BAD messaging around vaccines.

They also devoted headline first allergic reaction. say 3rd wave F like immediate effect, Baden-Württemberg starts vaccinating under-65s second priority STIKO recommendation. means teaching staff, many medical workers people intellectual disabilities also entitled vaccinate.

I guess many redditors eligible.

Probably good reason get flu shot think many people Germany tired this, cold week realistically last time people staying isolated. anecdotal opinion seems like lot people feel government really fucked up, vaccine invented still hardly anyone it, take direction people (Spahn) announcing things whenever feel like little follow-through?

I'm antimasker way, I'm pretending ends tomorrow. I'm saying virus something worry about. I'm saying vaccination going well far shows viable path this. That's it. I'm commenting difficulty people getting accurate picture what's happening right now, messaging issues. 


Why keep projecting things onto me?

I believe things accuse of. single one. I've worn masks since asked to, never complained post. once. like wearing one, do, understand need to. got vaccine became eligible. I'm encouraging everyone so. 

I'm glossing single fatality. know I've last year family through. making ton ridiculous assumptions zero basis reality.  


You know me, sure seem think figured out. Apparently wrong. government set online waiting list based priority groups. people highest category, go one category down.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Depends time range. last week, we've largely flattened out. indicates shift momentum, good direction. speculation, clearly we've reached balance current measures infections, want. vaccinations might eventually drive infections down, another possibility people taking risks assuming country safer is; virulent strains dominant raised R.

We'll know 2 weeks what's actually going today. Hindsight 20/21 :)

For take adequate precautions. Keep wearing masks. Social distance can, even sucks.  Approximately percentage people vaccine start making noticeable impact COVID-19 cases/deaths/hospitalizations? Paywalled Florida population California, would 60,00 deaths, would 20% greater number deaths compared California.

That 20% matters. total population? CDC also measures population 18. I've read, Sputnik vaccine something slightly different viral vector vaccines. Instead using viral vector doses like AZ vaccine does, uses different adenovirus strain dose, probably allows second dose effective, since immune system can't fight viral vector insert genetic material cells. I'm honestly wondering way go viral vector vaccines, since seems like ironically, effectiveness future doses undermined immune system. course, engineering producing different viruses dose probably lot difficult costly. appreciate rational discussion debate, thanks response.

I believe comes debate serious public threat virus justify shutting industries provide public health benefit, sake public health (I'm sure worded correctly cuz sounds like oxymoron).

It's personal opinion that, point, everything know dealing year, we're point people able make personal risk assessments decisions themselves. argument made government knows best take decisions individuals greater good. strongly disagree argument. Eastern Europeans complacent first wave virus reached later West. Lower infection rates put better corona response; however, clear along pandemic would hit, would hit Eastern Europe harder lack preparedness. That's exactly happening now. 

During first wave, affected hot spots West most. pandemic reached last remote village, matter are. 

That's bit happened Portugal too. periphery Europe beaten track, country well first wave reach world's highest death rates 2nd wave. Exactly. East Asia, Australia, New Zealand sacrificed lot little bit time paid huge dividends. Europe US decided sacrifice little nothing long time gotten basically nothing it. former extremely shitty months, okay couple months, terrific months past year we've stuck middle-of-the-road, variably shitty/ok entire year. People used become nearsighted due spending much time reading. glasses associated bookworms. Damn! NYT show 13%? Pol Pot wants word used commonly Europe.

Basically AZ allowed 65 year olds currently 80 year olds people high risk medical fields ( think ICU, care homes... ) able make vaccination appointments. 80 year olds obviously out, leaves high risk employees lot either already given Biontech  want AZ. highish number AZ shots enough arms people owning arms either old, already vaccinated truly want it. 
And gets tricky people pissed. Non priority people want get vaccinated would take vaccine allowed take AZ shots turn yet great burocracy rather lets 100 doses waste away shelf allow 1 person get vaccinated order . False. 

Calories in, calories works. 

I don’t deny hard change eating habits, ultimately, one cannot become obese without overeating. 

World Health Organization:

_”The fundamental cause obesity overweight energy imbalance calories consumed calories expended.”_

We trust WHO, right? Believe science. vaccine tracker get certain percentage take away restrictions.

Can't. work way. 

Just vaccinated mean can't CATCH SPREAD Coronavirus. still can. (it severe YOU.. immune system primed better fight it). could still spread end killing others. ""People don’t want wear masks rest lives.""

Understandable. necessarily want see either. genuinely think outcome,.. think pandemic irrevocably altered people see ""public-health"". 

That's kind underlying problem types ""infectious diseases"". people refuse wear masks risking/hurting themselves,. they're also harming others around them. 

People violate good public health guidelines ones penalized,. way around. kind thinking got us mess. I'm boat want add even need spend $800 equipment (although I'm sure awesome). bought resistance bands jump rope start pandemic, using combination running around neighborhood, bodyweight workouts, YouTube yoga videos kept decent shape throughout pandemic.

I really miss gym, like said, seems completely unjustifiable go back point (unless vaccinated). Staying healthy home totally doable require ton disposable income...just discipline creativity. Y'all got food? recently opened people comorbidities 63% NYers became eligible. getting shot Monday wait excruciating. certain age brackets make sense since co-morbidities far important. Yes, get seniors vaccinated instead continuing go oldest youngest past 60 open 50+ comorbidities opening everyone.   unions already making argument.once teachers chance get vaccine need come back regardless kids vaccinated Canada’s leadership merely groping around dark. Leadership Justin Trudeau’s forte. things knows throw money problems even problem isn’t financial. Otherwise he’s walking disaster one faux pas another. Beyond potential spread virus others directly becoming infected, mutations consuming news days logical consequence large number people collectively saying “fuck it. I’m young healthy. I’m gonna face thing ‘head on.’” not? NJ signed website waited. got e-mail telling sign appointment weeks later. directions sign appointment get site.

But state different. patient keep trying. March 19th 🤘🏼 school budgets get big windfall stimulus package. remote learning undoubtedly far inferior person vast majority young students, summer school person may help get back track they’ve lost past year Dear Dr. Woe-is-me, meet everybody else crushed situation. Lots people use awful mask. wear bandanas, neck gaiters thin cloths. 

Kind reason think double masking unfortunately brought mess message people.

Giving people access proper better mask could help lot. would say original plan mailing everyone would effective, think approach might effective.

Of course. Lots people choose thinner mask various reasons, disobedience, thinking forced prefer ""breath"" use them.

But portion population would wear proper mask access them. Pretty sure winter storm slowed things quite bit... vaccine largely distributed older generation. still advocating keeping kids school. can't even keep ideological consistent argument matter kids spread covid factor keeping schools closed people arguing open pointed THREAT KIDS. 

A fact conveniently ignored every step way go step step rabbit hole basically announce world give shit happens kids get feel morally superior. Kids spreading matter. matters even less vaccine distribution started. wouldn’t feel bad it. can’t anything jobs valued. say, despite low salaries, saw rough people working EMTs paramedics, despite majority competent jobs. impressed considering. vaccines offer 20x antibodies natural infection. So, 2x 4x reduction effectiveness still leaves plenty margin protection got contracts 8 different vaccines, produce Canada tho.

of 8 got delivery contracts 2 approved supply two must come European factory's American factories ive heard limiting amount get much get every week/month.

basically crap shoot, pre order buncha stuff 2 ready two delivery issues. Absolutely right, really shitty genetics die COVID 20s. Downvote want, thats truth, everyone born equal. IIRC there’s good evidence mRNA vaccines still effective SA variant. They’re good, think they’ll still offer good protection.

However, mom vaccine doesn’t make bullet proof. best way defeat disease multiple lines defense. know sure mom effective immune response COVID. There’s % vaccine work for, believe number gets higher age.

It would better wait you’ve vaccinated too, and/or continue wear mask.  key facts J&amp;J vaccine:

- One dose instead 2 doses (easier vaccinate people)

- stored standard refrigeration temperatures (35.6 46.4 degrees Fahrenheit, much easier logistics, transportation, storage)

- 85% effective stopping severe Covid-19 disease

- 72% effective moderate Covid-19 disease US

- **Prevented 100% hospitalizations deaths trials** (HUGE news, whole reason restrictions)

- 64% effective moderate disease **South Africa variant**, 81% effective severe disease (to reiterate, South Africa ""EEK"" variant 64% around *good* flu shot)

- Reduces asymptomatic transmission (74% less likely transmit virus others 71 days compared placebo)

There every reason think vaccine total game changer really help us get back normal much quicker. beyond excited it. Depends live guess. Alabama Ag workers eligible since 2/8.

In 15,000-volunteer U.K. trial, Novavax said, vaccine prevented nine 10 cases, including new strain virus circulating there. 4,400-volunteer study South Africa, vaccine proved 49% effective. 94% study population HIV, efficacy 60%. 

In U.K. trial, Novavax observed 62 cases symptomatic Covid-19, 56 placebo group six among volunteers got vaccine. One patient placebo developed severe Covid-19, compared zero vaccine group. company provided details vaccine’s safety, saying serious side effects rare balanced studies’ vaccine placebo groups.

In South African study, 29 cases symptomatic Covid-19 observed placebo group, 15 vaccine group.

SNIP

Novavax said already work new version vaccine designed combat infectious strains SARS-CoV-2, could work booster shot people already inoculated. clinical testing isn’t expected second quarter year. sympathize. invisible. think fair kids? No.

But think schools based data contributed greatly exponential growth? That's data says. justifiable close schools order curb virus vaccine place. Places like UK made right choice.

It's also reasonable time frame left within school year teachers ask vaccination going back person. enough health concerns death make people wary getting COVID; considering we've established younger kids spread it, contribute enough raise R 1 (even primary school kids). There's enough data, studies, etc. demonstrate transmission schools happens much thought (whether student student, student adult, adult student, adult adult), along various health factors (death, cardiovascular issues, etc.) ask people go back person without proper precautions.

And no, give grocery worker nonsense grocery workers sure hell treated alot better right now. well essential workers who've work nonsense without proper protections place. 3% lot?
When herd immunity 70-90% MS means tech workers deserve shit? two things linked?

I guess workers didn’t really choice. want return days? Work anyway? here? protection, yes. Sucks, they're still sure effective vaccines preventing transmission (though initial data encouraging), obviously new variants lack real testing data compare. It’s lab tests, Novavax J&amp;J reported pretty good efficacy SA variant trials, around 60% effective moderate symptomatic infection 100% efficacy preventing death hospitalization

Given mRNA vaccines showed greater efficacy two vaccines it’s likely still high degree efficacy SA variant    Possibly reasons think.

I literally going exact thing (turned 21 March last year) plan taking gap year this. God damn... WSB subreddit gonna fully immunized! last bit lockdowns curfews heroic absolutely insulting. Barbaric? Yes. Heroic? I’m Tina Turner really don’t need another hero. need find way home - want life beyond lockdown-dome. Good question. Antibodies two four times less effective still effective enough mount immune response. Pfizer noted vaccines 6x less effective treating South Africa strain, still enough provide level immunity.  I'm at, rescinded stay home order, gyms allowed open part called ""restrictions"", claim enough data prove gyms causing infections.

So people breathing heavily allowed remove masks they're working out, guys seriously claim proof danger? even need data (of enough regardless), figured simple thought experiment.

I'm shocked are. Lol  $200 year little cheap side average gym, thousand year absurd. Even fancy rich people gym near 60 month (so like 720 year).

And also, $800 even close enough anything even resembling complete home gym setup. could get, like, two things. bought SINGLE pair 60lb dumbbells beginning pandemic cost $230. one set dumbbells. one weight.  gym need? judging, curious. thought big chain gyms mediocre anyway?  Tell brother hate him. me. stay home read, internet, play games. Rarely go out. it’s safe I’m going casino, I’m going eat, I’m going bar, I’m gonna kinds things CAN. Somebody pointed roaring 20s came pandemic 1918 World War ended.  think we’re due another roaring 20s Probably going need fight freedom summer riots come screams now,""SUCK RETRAIN!!!"" First shot, pretty sore arm two days. Second moderna shot, sore arm around 12 hours later body aches joint pain. Took tylenol, difficult night sleeping discomfort. Next day still uncomfortable took easy. night almost back normal, next day totally fine. Better Covid! Cool  first shot generally well tolerated (i work ER 100 people know gotten rounds already)

The second shot people experience side effects. get nothing sore arm, get aches/chills/fatigue 24-48 hours. possible try get second shot day next day off. may get anything may need day off. went back gym like yoga pilates classes, promised reduced capacity strict mask enforcement, however twice felt like sardine tin second time realize none instructors correcting mask violators. paused membership april run outside tennis 2 days raining That's probably fair. pay slightly higher level membership. genuinely would gym personally becoming increasingly imperative lose weight. I'm tired overweight I'm suffering health issues overweight. take mask gym clean machines use. social distance tailor workouts stay away crowds people wear mask properly. also try stay away peak hours. isn’t true. FWIW I've going gym entire time (it's one thing cannot give up, I've sacrificed literally everything else) able (which be, since go chain state do), one great thing go right close. go 9:30, roughly 90 minutes close, given night MAYBE 10 people there, tops. that's pretty large building, number go 5 less toward end night. Plus people time, always crowd late lifters (was true pre-pandemic well), opposed random people place. Assholes take masks off, idiots come work right next options away. place empty, move away people continue workout 20++ feet away them.

It ain't exactly safe. basically consider always potentially virus gym activity, behave around people. I've going gym 9 past 12 months caught yet (as far know). Maybe 50 million Biden's term? Lol college opened gym unused arena.....
At least they’re trying, school thought opening 2 4 dining halls save bucks would great idea. Yes! They've done amazing job Thanks Nope. happening. YMMV, side effects whatsoever second one wear mask correctly, too.. Yep. Jump back horse ride.

Its glorious. need make yearly flu vaccinations widely accepted change work/society culture around working going ••When you’re ill**. stay home sick. That’s would make difference flu. biggest problem, people refuse stay home sick. (and bosses expect work sick) Yes makes sense. guess I’m hoping figure way make work arts essential city. 

I didn’t mean anything negative outrageous prices necessarily, people pay prices would pay even given chance exclusive, limited run event. Density MSG 2000 fans Friday's Ranger game. Knicks whenever play next. Crazy seeing mentality’s change! remember seeing comment month ago media general population would start become optimistic believe it. There’s definitely still lot pessimism think it’s getting positive generally. Damn, $1465 per month? Nurses America make 3-4 times that.  Get measured response totally reasonable thought process.

In seriousness, good recognizing issue going taking action. always easy do. definitely singing along song grocery store speakers rhythmically moving cart aisle weeks ago. I'm introvert. yes, I'm bored point fun I've bars clubs closed. Fell truck.  ""The whole team needs vaccinated""

I highly doubt every single teacher willing get vaccinated.  $240 I'm major city. Hell lot cheaper rack, treadmill, stationary bike hundreds pounds weight. Plus guest bedroom office room shit anyway. Yeah eat food face covered men future there? wonder people prefer daughters sons? don’t understand teachers aren’t getting vaccinated healthcare workers? It’s logical, since work higher risk situation, safely person instruction? Don’t want schools reopen? It’s insane honesty, seemed mostly normal me. didn´t many friends Covid, work anyways. excuse sit home! keep focusing making sure people get second dose soon possible even though studies UK show better give many people first dose can. like supply increasing reason need saving second doses people many without first dose. think cheap propaganda. Disparage Pfizer praise Sinopharm. I've seen better infomercials. She’s trying save lives. hella lucky Birthday February. got celebrate month world went hell still can't grasp friend extreme outlier I'm afraid beyond help.  You’re going feel little pinch, you’re good, you’ll get sticker. Yeah, maybe approved vaccines effective ethnicities. conflate modern medicine Tuskegee experiments give ground charlatan vaccine deniers.

Bringing Tuskegee fuels vaccine skepticism causes unnecessary deaths. Absolute nonsense  mean, that's probably literally true point diminishing returns.

Again, can't reason way emotion fear. conspiracy! Brits shoving at-cost vaccines gullible throats!

Also 38 days plenty new. think bot anything comments generally reasonable. Brits talking AZ shit amongst 'our'selves /r/unitedkingdom , /r/ukpolitics /r/CoronavirusUK past month, hardly surprising sort consensus formed. pram thing funny though. trials work lmfao. efficacy measures differences control vaccine groups. vast majority

They've told sit inside year put back line told high enough risk get vaccine. They've treated like shit like lives expendable ""greater good"" i.e. obese people baby boomers. I'm thinking correct. Less concern feed virus multiple locations (if all) cannot assume vaccination tool have. continued use masks social distancing. go thinking virus eliminated, simply adding fuel fire.

Once every adult wants vaccine chance get it, gradual easing restrictions one two month window (because vaccines require multiple doses vaccine takes several weeks become fully effective final shot).

After two month window over, almost restrictions go away. idea kind people getting first? Right. Bend curve spread deaths, squash curve. ‘bad job’ actually 1/6th modeled deaths, fairly well spread out.

Yeah I’m 20s feel like wasted year living life wanted. living abroad working dream job. come home. knows I’ll get vaccinated hang indoors, keep ""hang out"" group people mindful visiting elderly high risk people. definitely see plateau small peak happening next month, predicted areas like CA Florida higher numbers B.1.1.7 sequenced. However, far doomsday scenario especially consider vulnerable people vaccinations, going continue drive deaths/hospitalizations l. far cry last winter's peak Here's Google's mobility data California (Feb, 20201) compared pre-pandemic mobility ( warning, .pdf). shows people staying home more. 

This actual data, anecdotal ""I drove past restraint looked full!"" stuff. Retail &amp; recreation : -26%

 Grocery &amp; pharmacy: -15%

 Parks: +1%

 Transit stations: -38%

 Workplaces: -17%

 Residential: +6% Really big surge started last two weeks August continued September. reflected explosion death toll October. September, government preoccupied winning regional election. country seen various festivals timeframe, pilgrimage St. Wenceslaus day, wine burcak festivities, farms markets Prague’s river fronts, film festivals, etc. add school openings explosion infection happened. Lockdown measures implemented middle October. mid-May end September, emergency health panel meet precautions implemented. area live opening vaccine appointments people comorbidities, one people immunocompromised. hashimoto's disease well pituitary tumor (pituitary tumors benign, though hormonal impacts see endocrinologist make sure everything's ok front). Would count immunocompromised person?

NOTE: question purely curiosity, absolutely intend jump line get vaccinated right even technically qualify. I'm 22 years old, older people people serious comorbidities like cancer, diabetes, heart disease etc. absolutely access me. would guess so. Mine Polk whatever county Ft. Meyers got ‘em 3 weeks ago India needs massively focus citizens. rate they're going, take 11 years achieve 70% coverage. fuck No, US could never crushed Covid. *best* could gotten similar results EU. US government power take unilateral action like Vietnam China airtight borders like Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan, South Korea. exciting, imagine deal flu corona common cold. study reviewed COVID-19 cases country start January 2nd week February. ordered variant frequency (B.117 12% COVID-19 cases period towards end period approach half cases). corrected age pre-existing conditions, 64% likely become hospitalized B.117 ""ordinary"" variants. Note statistic confidence interval 32-104%, even lower number ends right one that's significant change. So, study B.117 infecting people, risk going hospital depending variant got.

They published data deaths B.117 vs. variants I'm fairly sure (still) country get useful data this. However, mentioned reply UniquesNotUseful, UK done points higher mortality rate B.117, expect hospitalization rate higher. payback students tuition don’t? Lots colleges similar bait switch last year - promise reopen shutdown campus immediately due “cases”. Canada isn’t guaranteed fully vaccinated September it’s real concern. Sarasota County. father-in-law can’t get around well they’re list fire department comes house vaccinate - maybe that’s it’s taking long them? damn, need get then, mean we've done already right here! got roommate literally goes nowhere except gym believe Morons make larger part society anyone wants admit. right! Definitely feeling now. Mostly body aches fine. note, that's would happen Connecticut stick plan. idea works state, probably rules. saying would like work ideally That's true, break regionally:  


We're seeing signs plateau everywhere. Bad bot. Fingers crossed get info hit UK Israel. would horrible see another big wave mainland Europe.

I hope vaccine production ramp blunt seems like matter time devastating UK. 1b group 30s? health care underlying conditions? I’m curious NC, someone healthy 30s last group. certain states. think New Jersey one. fair one said 20 euro per vaccine much. Therefor EU missed deal Pfizer.   Hm. Wonder depends comorbidities. keeps feeling like we’re close still far away. hope starts ramping soon though. would suck someone ends catching covid dying waiting vaccine says 30% symptoms long 9 months, 9 months over.

Have heard everyone recovering long COVID?  still use grocery delivery think moving something new. option selecting stores. select Amazon store, that's Lysol spray price. schedule delivery later day next day free Prime spend $35. think important consider hypotheses go hyperbole like ""the end days upon us.""

Back December, percentage change hospital rises every day previous week many weeks row, one day wasn't. Hospitals still rose, first time awhile rose smaller percent day previous week. turned harbinger decline, size rise continued drop weeks later became drop, we've dropping every since.

It's certainly possible blip, small changes direction often first signs something real changing. too. think religious protections include behaviors impact (""your right swing fist around ends nose""). absolutely makes sense protect religious person's right dress according religious beliefs, pray appropriate time(s) day, etc. think appropriate lump getting vaccinated rest behaviors. Religion give people right expose others deadly illnesses.   think far many people underestimate impact places like Disney Universal closed COVID response. 95% effective 1 dose preventing hospitalisations according Scottish study.

Come Germany, get going, want visit whenever let back in. Lots love Scotland. anyone lacking masks point?

However, believe /u/witty82 saying top-line efficacy numbers vaccine symptomatic disease. words, they're answering ""No"" question ""if explains efficacy differences"". People don’t seem want accept May 3rd doesn’t mean May 3rd. It’s realistic expect it’ll completely booked soon opens up. county? mucus membranes in-laws Florida 80s still waiting list. It’s always “about” explode. hope you’re right people saying weeks.  Realistic got upvote also happening Slovakia, western Ukraine, Slovenia, lesser toll. Slovakia next Czechia highest death toll per capita. Slovak government accused underreporting misleading infections last month Slovak Covid data reported accurately several weeks. Currently, rate infection pretty much similar Czechia. Poland unknown due one lowest testing rates Europe; considering ongoing infection south east, numbers far worse reported. Hungary avoided spike due higher vaccination rate even ahead Austria. Austria also lot problems Tirol. Entire Central Europe f.ed.  
Czechia unique due egoistic selfish attitude population mismanagement government really care it. infection also masked excellent Czech healthcare 1.7% infected died. Even many elderly survived. 20,000 deaths must also looked overall 1.1 millions infection. media also feeds population misinformation minimize health threat. undermines prevention. known since October monthly death tolls worst republic seen since WW2 met overall apathy. officially every 9 person infected, communal spread unstoppable without emergency measures like martial law military handling state machinery; option/will/interest stop infection. people cusp 65+ range? Like 55-64? comorbidities. People like still can’t get vaccine area it’s stressing people saying weeks vaccines ramping area. (Not CT btw) might complete gyms, gym equipment weights. pushups cells anything else do. Personally I'd also least attempt get fit strong locked up, since living among criminals exactly safe environment. still advocate gyms closed though. obvious outbreaks occur there. many paragraphs say absolutely nothing substance. 

I agree OP- people post Pandemic? Wearing masks everywhere go? go events crowds? think school lot vaccinated teachers, consider bringing kids back April. Zoom teaching sucks kids really lagging behind. getting close one year remote working well Checked post history. think guy trying summon demon reddit. 2022 going full news litigious suits around vaccinations people's ""rights"" ""beliefs"".

You know, civil war mean time.  Lame, boss gave endless unpaid vacation Headline says vaccine still work. Hardly clickbait title you’re suggesting is.

This seems scientifically accurate, sensational respect.  knew bad boys would serve another purpose. live rural Ontario.

They've already told us they're going rent novel indoor hockey rink turn mass vaccination center even time comes.

If they've already got solid plans village 5000 Toronto probably handled. That’s another pandemic casualty. judgmentalism fear everyone bc people’s quickness condemn people bare minimum mental health going gym since October, twice week. Still haven’t gotten it. Gym runs 30% capacity masks worn times. It’s certainly totally safe it’s super dangerous either I’d caught it. 🥱😴 knows though? knows trust anything news? know prison. can't even imagine life like anymore. bro :(

Not teeth gnashing it’s painful. feel younger people. Thinking time experiences passing depressing I'm old man what, big chunk life younger age really tragic Put lens front mask it’ll problem. basic human rights end people’s rights begin. think sound like person who's qualified informed.

It’s wicked hard. even consider fairly well adjusted I’ve absolute wreck past year. imagine hard it’s everyone else. feeling feel like we’re allowed express around people again, things go back normal. observing proven anything, it’s hard keep people away other, even aren’t supposed together. Sending lots love staying cautiously optimistic! it’s not. middle lifetime pandemic. Sometimes requires breaking norms. 6 weeks year standard places America.

America beyond fucked. bother butter soft liberals, weak wear mask. require it. Unless medical reason take vaccine risks far outweighed benefits required people work person. hunch you’re right, might hit 80-90% back within year, 100% might take another year three.  People done, vaccines rolling out, idiots saying ""well may spread stay distant!"" even response mass vaccination occurred. favorite ""stay distant close businesses controlled countries yet"" virus Turkey matters go gym bay area.


Then wonderful replies easy is...or feigned sympathy cozy work home jobs full families berate anyone seeing friends family, blissful ignorant horrible impact mitigation (however needed before) others.

I love, absolutely love, sub started hit breaking point restrictions. 

I've assholes call plague rat simply work industry relies bars restaurants open, shoe foot scary? idea people can't sustain another months let alone rest year really cross anyone's minds here? ""minimal precaution"" personal trainer group workout class instructor's way fucking survival. bar gets shit talked open someone's hard work someone else pays rent. 

I hope service industry brothers sisters remember treated....how talked much pointing negative impact restrictions us livelihoods. Lockdown forever types ""in together"" like claim, they're privileged selfish, care virus kills makes someone sick, give fuck economic ruin us left in.

Oh good one: ""well blame government taking care you"" justification continue years longer, maybe us actually really liked jobs, maybe year fucking long missed contacts events going damage client base years come. yeah, constant stimmy enough make rest non monetary damage..... 


Look, get it. happen. sucks...and died got way, WAY, worse us lost much financially. utter dismissal negative consequences shut distancing orders really fucking irresponsible. need clear exit strategy, need promises attempting ""zero COVID"" strategy take years economic mental ruin achieve. People pretty fed all... Covid basically zero threat entire demographic people schools. Shutting schools people caught covid extremely backwards thinking taking risk elimination approach, risk management. Teachers teach every year number diseases circulating get sick make feel ill, ultimately leave ok. year breaking point teachers, need find new profession risk tolerance significantly low interacting kids general public daily basis. Yet another reason go gyms... really Wikipedia link page crab mentality like common knowledge? Yikes. 

Not everyone knows everything, made assumption knew? intimately familiar concept surprising found perspective relevant point worth making.  

I can't imagine many companies small giving employees 5 days would bankrupt them, rather beside point anyway. Directing hate tech workers whatever benefits employers provide misplaced aggression ultimately self-defeating.  opened two weeks ago close many teaching staff came COVID, well 5% students.  Another story obvious answer ""duh""... gone gym year cause exact reason. snowy icy outside time. gonna lie, really prefer convenience gym. grocery store time leave house. got infected month ago, wait two months get vaccine? Asking friend banned lives health? opened two weeks ago close week many teaching staff sick UK varient. want back school, want COVID...... Yup. Keep downvotes coming. Tell reddit algorithm POS am. I'm surprised. friend who's nurse said surprisingly lot nurses anti-vax. Good. slippery slope mandate therapy without long term data. I’m teacher personally don’t know teachers saying this. know (including me) pushing virtual option families want next year, don’t know anyone pushing full virtual teachers get vaccines. I’m sure exist, don’t think they’re majority. congrats go get ur gains bro think falls underestimation influenza. Don’t space yet, there's smoking gun either. gyms main driver, think would know now?

And not, contribute small amount spread, do.we balance risks benefits? Gyms open good thing. Canadians told wait September. 7 day average cases fallen 25000 December 7000 now. Third wave? will... delusional would funny weren’t sad hang people ""bubble"" I'm risking neighbors calling cops me. high impact papers authors different nationalities usually multiple institutions too. complicate things. overwhelming amount evidence remote education working well basically anyone. fact 50% parents keeping kids home suggests confidence kid going get worthwhile education even go person. reads pretty damning rebuke peoples confidence teachers means need restore peoples confidence public education system, erode continuing pathetically ineffective method education.

None us think terms US vs China vs Europe. agree completely, science global. works really well way. I'd prefer see long term studies done ""emergency use"" phase mRNA. forced accelerated trials time, hopefully get back science based regular trial periods. NJ appointments made advance online. made registering sites online/phone reach you. made sites releasing appointments either set times throughout day randomly. sites fill questionnaire checks you’re eligible usually asking covid covid symptoms, medical conditions qualify you, you’re 65. essentially fill forms say yes I’m smoker.

Plenty people know flying across anyways. too! Exactly. Science discounted much one side, side overcorrecting it. guys want minimize deaths fine, comes point there's net loss society restrictions, point we're rapidly approaching. Ideally, politician would take public health expert's advice, psychologists advice, economists advice dictate public policy based thinks optimal society. problem public health experts taken gospel followed exactly, like insisted restrictions even elderly vaccinated, microscopic chance young healthy person dying. Ideally governor would like, hey, economic damage mental health toll worth save 5 people dying day, open back risk overwhelming hospitals, people stay home want.

People wearing masks. properly spaced out. Even are, still breathing heavily. Covid lingers air people inside gym prolonged period time get exposed. 

This according me. virus spreads. Go take covid. 

You exercise without gym. gym ""the best"" way it. Go talk doctor ask optimal workout terms endorphins physical health. 99% guarantee tell brisk walk enough. type movement home online class YouTube video.

But people spoiled refuse work outside gym temporarily much inconvenience pandemic? NOPE.

Nobody said anything staying inside forever. even staying inside. Heck, spend half weekend hikes running outdoors. yes would rather safe get covid covid variant. I'm going take precautions even get vaccinated due unknowns variants.

There plenty athletes got covid longer work out. one thing gym goer extra extra careful covid result long term symptoms affect future ability exercise. motives anyone else.

Regardless one catches Covid, still spread others might die even not. gyms particularly good place catch respiratory illness. 

If you’re going argument people go gym healthier not, might generally true- know obesity tied poor Covid outcomes- it’s still roll dice. healthy young people gotten sick died. 

There safer ways get exercise going gym right now. I’ve almost year. point, gotta get people vaccinated solve problem country never stood chance. You’ll need proof underlying condition can’t really commit fraud. Ask doctor note describing condition believe one. Getting second dose Pfizer vaccine March 9! optimistic things get better year, spring seems like stretch IMO. entered University year shit started, stopped talking previous friends make university. year since talked anyone aside parents sometimes feel like real life, dream I'm completely disconnected reality. still feel like someday wake life resumed point pandemic began.

Also people talking extending school year, bringing teachers back etc. people know absolutely nothing almost criminal. wouldnt tell job, went school point life even give fraction understanding educational policies practice.

You cant ""extend"" school year without laws executive action, teachers unions need bargain new contract pay. also cant start new programs school budgets set year advance. cant bring small % teachers back bc theres enough staff student ratios work.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* gym says “wear mask get in, mask requirement using equipment”. literally makes sense.  think issue “more patience” messaging goal posts keep changing, seems pointless. knock said specifically public/media messaging. shipment cancelled last week, gave 160 shots.

Getting 400 doses week, can't administer many, right around 150 week, hopefully 300 next week. good see people calling crap is. pretty pathetic ignore everything wrote bring lie, say 'try again' made point. BMI 35 kg / m^2 Yep, two weeks fine everything running smoothly, snowstorm disrupting vaccine supply, testing, data reporting, etc. best determining trends. Yes. wait everyone else wants vaccine chance get it. still careful. Destroy media. Well it’s like see headlines say “Don’t assume return normal life you’ve vaccinated!!!!!” unsure specifics. Well Fauci even said could potentially spread information virus changes rapidly. two weeks ago heard him. Said could spread inside nose vaccinated Israeli data (where they've large successful vaccine rollout) shows *very significant* reductions transmission rate (89.4%) vaccinated individuals, article states. reason believe outlier otherwise bad data. saying unmasked close contact gatherings major source spread pandemic? Large group events major source spread? question is, vaccine still prevent vast majority hospitalizations deaths, anyone concerned? governments really never gonna let us thing they?

“We need learn past experience,” said Dr. Erez Barenboim, director-general Samson Assuta Ashdod University Hospital. “The opening economy proceed solely accordance number patients reproduction rate, recent days send unequivocal message time halt steps forward regarding opening economy.” 

This comment stemming rise POINT 3 reproduction rate lol. Uh can't that's law. world sick continue ignore it. Yeah sanitize covid, sanitize that's I've always done gym. common courtesy. Maybe make sure kids eating shit redo ventilation system. Look every coronavirus. Antibodies build immunity disease don’t eliminate transmission. There’s still lot don’t know. Hence call novel coronavirus. Ya live gym mask requirements moment. wear walk in, start exercising don’t need all. 1 gym went 50% mask rate, one probably 10% mask rate. surprised all. twitter threads lots suggestions, nothing concrete I've seen past week.  Yeahhh don’t think people understand many deaths every year everything else, weren’t thinking pandemic. I’m rationalizing all. densely populated areas going spread. failed contain getting community really stopping it. 

But clear absolutely failed onset continued fail entire time. It’s National embarrassment don’t think you’re going agree answer mine understand government agencies erring side caution. can’t speak state state, don’t like way governor handled don’t expect timeline would shoddy estimate. 

As federal, understand power hands states, don’t think initial planned response top, consistent messaging support would made difference? I'm paranoid, naive, one's perfect. can't eat restaurant hall monitors like !!! admit people trying ""freedoms"" wanting live life extended entire situation.

No haven't. whole point restrictions lockdowns extend pandemic longer period time. everyone got sick hospitals could overrun death would skyrocket.

There literally two ways this. Either everyone gets vaccinated everyone gets sick. Thankfully vaccines going save us wait everyone get sick.

It's huge misconception people lockdown hard enough extended didn't. would understand except they’re already making everyone 6 feet away, masked visit (which ends FaceTime door it’s cold resident go outside) sign waiver exempting facility kind responsibility resident gets covid. Which...if none us allowed near heck giving her!?!? understand whole liability thing. end tho? never hug again? kids allowed year missed seeing Great Granddaughter continues? point needs conversation mental health well. year isolation people love touch excruciating her. Absolutely!!! 
The constant changing narrative really angers me. thing talking granting rights vaccinated people. promise it, basically told us young robust ones need stay home greater good - endanger old, sick - vaccinated old, sick whoever Prio group go out, ones stayed collectively home - rest need endure lockdown? 

Fuck you. GLAD someone called episode Daily. Barbaro turned drama 100 probably one counterproductive pieces reporting I’ve heard yet vaccinations. essentially said life won’t get better vaccinations probably get worse. I’m big fan Daily, Barbaro lost respect day. 5%? Bars commercial social spaces specifically designed ""extract money peple"".

 gym Uni Gym pay money go it, massively boosts mental health (the act exercising alone raises seratonin levels brain), allows people maintain healthy bodies amd lifestyles goal gym interact others (unlike bars ""other social spaces"").

Correct I'm wrong imagine regularly go gym/did regularly go gym precovid? Thanks around bunch people infected virus eight hours day, winch case many healthcare workers, doesn’t statistically mean higher risk getting it? Amazon Prime Vaccine country bars restaurants closed, thought hundreds people cramed small areas infuriates me. want go enjoy good meal family friends, can't yet since law like good reasons. respect people different opinions different countries, fuck looking me. distribution problem.

But is. Germany allow AZ 65+ opened vaccination beyond 80+ front line health care workers. week opening vaccinations next priority group younger people AZ vaccinations ramp up.

The ""quasi-ineffective"" tweet Macron widely reported Germany. Handelsblatt article quickly branded false German health minister. Main problems reported low efficacy numbers trials, especially SA variants, reports strong side effects hospital staff calling sick great numbers reports countries allowing AZ elderly. None reports wrong lot damage AZ reputation. conspiracy German politicians. know treat lot better now. point there's diminishing returns, sure, focus defining risk level acceptable society. Also, vaccine push button solution fix things. long societal issues like people refusing wear masks get vaccine, we'll longer time hit threshold. variant covid (""strain"" scientifically correct term) version virus difference RNA. 10's thousands variants covid, detected since beginning pandemic. completely normal: viruses mutate time. 

In past months, many media outlets playing every new variant detected like end world, since discovered gets lots clicks. 

The vaccines used US effective currently known covid variants. 

The flu mutates faster covid number reasons. But, possible sometimes need booster shots covid also. professionals type endorse crossing one's fingers

Every time somebody signs informed consent, crossing fingers. There's far certainty craps table given medical consultation. public health, entire business probability statistics. publicly employed epidemiologists advise policy-makers hard need cross fingers. reasonable risk take going bar restaurant, chance getting seriously ill trivial. would comparable saying. still *possible* could transmit vaccinated. end day, big deal wear mask half hour costco months neccessary? Also, seems like even read original comment, talking *should* whatever ""risky"" activity want vaccinated. Check science again. mRNA vaccines minor versions virus. Fauci really good communicating good news, understanding media looking scariest half sentence says 30 minute interview put headline. I'm sure getting hate from.. reason care much used travel work. friends worked resorts Australia New Zealand flee unable work, working abroad eligible government aid returned US. gave every bedroom home, including bedroom house people displaced thrown poverty lockdowns. find privileged among us ones support draconian measures, effected it, yet. usually last ones lift finger help, instead mock belittle struggling. Sad. worse? idea anything March. didn’t even know bad was. Sure. That's ""efficacy"" figure hear flu, typically something like 40-60% keep getting sick flu.**  vaccine prevents millions illnesses flu-related doctor’s visits year.

But also vaccination shown several studies reduce severity illness people get vaccinated still get sick.**

I.E. unlucky 60%-40%, got exposed flu, less likely die, less likely go ICU, etc. thanks vaccine.

Someone know tested positive covid, mild case thank God, thing is, made big preachy post FB wears thick masks religiously, sometimes lenient 6 feet thing result got covid despite wearing mask, basically saying absolutley both.

Only one problem though, hanging friends maskless social distancing througout entire pandemic behind scenes.

Yeah TOTALLY reason tested positive, wore mask stood 5 feet away someone instead 6 /s people know confirmed COVID cases. count one hand ones *extremely* mild cases.

(They actually average 64,000 three days ago). It’s clear different sources give different numbers even relatively small. thing is, needs monitored longer.

Currently testing centers opening up. is, offense, slightly foolish look spike 2-3 days declare start new wave. could drop right back tomorrow. increase. possible. It’s thing check next week. week etc. there’s simply enough time see luck ran out. Numbers dropping cause nursing home people vaccinated... wonder numbers actually dropping community mean states enact almost public health mandates see day day basis federal government doesn’t authority kind control states. far know, state except Utah actual plan back full normal. much ask point, year later well mass rollout highly effective vaccines? people England date normality though* seasonal virus. I'm 100% sure AstraZeneca falsely leaked ""we'll send 50% 180M expected Q2"" tidbit lower EU's expectations happy 70-75% percent doses sounds like still new information?? Interesting. come point want communicate people getting first shot, get X instead? anyone talked situation lot people first shots there's supply left 2-dose vaccine? Forgive ignorance, popped head. learn. Great quote! Yeah, anyone thinks art dead never known creative person. They’re highly motivated.

The mess last year year become *part* expression, shut down. new variant still undiscovered may fuck everything up.

It really depends definition “fucking things up”. 

The UK variant already fucked things pushing threshold herd immunity 80% so. SA variant fucked things enough South Africa willing use AstraZeneca vaccine low efficacy strain. would consider pretty significant fuck ups. feel there's lot related knowledge minorities poor WAY affected general average. Things especially bad them, feels like celebrating improvements premature vulnerable left out. one mention ethics ...

Do think ethical? 

Geographic arbitrage new thing, common America. best examples crossing border get cheaper booze cigs. consider unethical.

I thought going get shot different state. know eligible 2 neighboring states right now, last phase live. “ nursing homes, four five residents vaccinated. states, Connecticut West Virginia, reported finishing vaccinations nursing homes, many employees smaller share residents nationally declined get shot.”

How four five?!! people should’ve vaccinated week 1. don’t want lose gainz!! Sinopharm 24 February reported 9900 cases; month earlier, 24 January reported 30,000 cases. 

The weekly rates per 100k: 116.4 7 day period ending 19 Feb; seven days earlier, 7 day period ending 12 Feb, 137.1 per 100k. 

Seems pretty positive me.  TIL least toddler's understanding subject I'm trying discuss = overeducated. Never change, Reddit. reporting delays due snowstorms last week. Actual cases still declining, begin see daily reported cases / deaths going within days.  ""few"" mean majority Americans lose employment income past year.

The K shaped recovery real many people thrust financial difficulty, high side includes upper middle class such, billionaires. still massive demand things like service entertainment. symptoms like coughing. thought best opportunity observe virus aerosolized started living room, choice. First day tested negative. face masked on. contact. Every move alcohol disinfect whole body make sure contact atlease 5 meters apart. 4 days precautions got positive I'm assymptomatic. 14 days got negative result again.

A month ago, father around somebody tested positive wore mask, didn't. ended testing negative, agree Covid spread via aerosol airborne. mu concerning variants? course should. Enjoy mom!

It massive failure messaging even question. narrative used?

Deutschland.   According research, still image autistic person causes overwhelming negative reaction. Subsequent observations interactions improve worsen  Hardly anyone that. internet magnifies critics. percentages compared non-vaccined time frame... lot videos YouTube, literally thousands search ""apartment friendly workouts"" something like that. 

Is possible ignore neighbor? Let know covid working home 30 minutes day that's be, like not? happens reports you? report to? would imagine working home covid nonetheless crime anything would get trouble for. neighbor bothered it, problem. move out. guess maybe move neighbor bad reports putting shoes???

I found lifting weights (even regular dumbbells) quiet enough workout. Especially bicep curls, shoulder exercises, triceps, etc. Lunges also pretty quiet. Squats. studio bad neighbor ""reports"" simply moving...I would come game plan move decide ignore neighbor take landlord something. limit movement crazy neighbor living you. cause wish could go good parties compromised older need worry. 

Americans brain worms. ""Who cares kill parents grandparents ok"". Gyms open? people want help. Believe me. People care. one deserves going through. lol definitely don’t understand vaccines mutations could together “A lie travel around world back truth lacing boots.” - Mark Twain

This problem Oxford/AZ faced. lot people believe bad news without question comes good news distrust especially goes counter anything heard previously. Care first asking people too. Go gym, make money, find ways improve life. Everything fall place start caring yourself. start throwing pity party, people push away. allowed members wear masks working wild me. I've gone nowhere except gym (and half people see 4x week said gym classes, half nurses/doctors) gotten it. gym max occupancy 10, I've working 10 people year. Meanwhile boyfriend caught either work grocery store.

I say I'm thankful found tiny community gym everyone extremely careful wear mask 100% time, wipes everything disinfectants use actually notifies gym they've tested positive (we've TWO people test positive entire time, one June one January. gym went lockdown 24hrs extra deep cleaning notified exactly days/times last 5 days person gym). bf able pause membership whole month knew chance could asymptomatic carrier. gym class people become friends COVID pod.

Anyway, going chain location larger location would noped super quick. reports massive spread gyms countries (e.g. Korea) still think mask wearing biggest issue here. Dropbox giving 12 extra days off(1 company holiday every month)! sang chorus pre-covid. miss much it’s safe obviously don’t want us return. We're nearly finish line giving up.

That's metaphor America. Yoooo finally someone else. hahah homie. people look like i'm clinically insane. cheers, enjoy ocular contraction virus.  Translation: Pfizer want risk sued vaccine, insists governments giving immunity lawsuits. governments want that, Pfizer considers risky sell vaccine.

Note standard U.S. UK countries. yet, try vanilla carnation instant breakfast shakes. thing coworker could tolerate covid.  Walking briskly, yes. jogging. portable treadmill Amazon $200-$300, probably amount saved gym membership last year. work home exercises. 
There options. jogging place guy video quiet literally work creeky old ass studio apartments. suggestions cardio make sound floor? neighbor reports even put heels getting ready. I'm loss, raining constantly outside freezing cold (I chronically low iron makes really sensitive temperature changes) studio nowhere equipment. feel like thing inside stretching that's like it. already got vaccine doses want gym stay open. article says Wednesday morning. another 2.4m vaccinations Wednesday today would reach 50m (they days high past). definitely will. wealthy afford groceries necessities delivered

many jobs allow remote work least jobs work close quarters increasing risk transmission

who's risk catching &amp; transmitting - store worker lives multigenerational home someone wealthy enough live one family one home? due respect argument herd immunity transmission slowing itself. vaccinating perfectly groups mainly living working together impact transmission different e.g. vaccinating kids, pastors traveling sales men many diverse contacts. uncle died dumbass cousin snuck gym tell anyone late. agree stance letting employers push people rest said concerning vaccine pretty spot right? Yeah let's stop studying new strains settle current vaccines rather update keep people informed. That's infectious diseases work, dumbass. temporary? seen specific dates given restrictions government health officials. information know please share. Actually, treadmills really inexpensive. Especially consider much money saved year paying gym membership. couple hundred dollars Amazon. best quality, fine period time. also treadmills fold store away use. 

There types cardio workouts can't run. know personal experience, different injuries prevented running. kind interesting hearing people complain all. long time ago running half marathons go years run due issue foot. Years. Thought would never able run again. Found ways exercise. racial slur last 3 comments dude smoke mirrors. that, even tape sometimes (though irritates hella sensitive skin). matter much bend wire still get fog lol. Maybe big nose rigid glasses, idk Cause bad that's bet would reported “100% effective reducing deaths” made Cambridge Uni.

Well eradicate flu 

I'm sure eradicate goal. 

I remember reading data flu transmission masks data said parties wearing mask risk transmission reduced much 80 percent more.

Is crazy imagine world wear masks risk transmitting respiratory virus exists? always live world washing hands using restroom norm workplace requirement restaurants. feel like going thing schools too.

We classrooms windows, windows can't open, windows allowed open. good ventilation systems. Kids wear masks, especially parents don't. confined spaces hours upon hours day eat classroom together. Parents send children vomiting school regular times, think low grade fever keep home? Absolutely not. 

I get need go back school, also done things like cut classroom sizes, hire teachers, buy building space actually distant, etc etc etc. 

There safe ways, sure. reality followed can't followed amount wishful thinking changes that. exactly privileged? Please explain me. 

Highlighting challenge raising kids, one many experiencing right home school working home, great example sacrifice. 

If label calling dangers deadly virus, supporting CDC said regarding gyms, stating facts ""belittling"" problem, mine. 

You pity me? That's funny reflects immaturity. 

You telling working home same? I'm someone works home former gym goer. talking wrong person trying prove point me. 

Everyone dealing situations right ""the same"". 

You know medical issues people deal with. do, trust me. know people permanently injured point limited mobility. suffer health issues limit do. know someone developed severe asthma longer run it. lot know world struggles many, many people face. fortunate good health. 

Do want do, point thread highlight dangers gyms. instead people acknowledging reality, whole lot people complaining terrible was/is go gym. Meanwhile, people hospitalized dying covid. Doctors nurses working tirelessly months risking lives taking care covid patients. Parents lives taken away juggle parenthood + work + homeschooling. strikes odd anyone would complain able work out. Especially say gym necessity option exercise true. send local swamp Germans please, we're limited number vaccins, number people willing take them. subreddit become total joke people like steeb821. pathetic, you. fat you? saw post reddit said someone claims gotten reinfected once!!

What's annoying sub comments like ""Yea course. obvious."" say went friend's house drank two roommates maskless 3 already Covid I'm lectured ""it's still risky"" toughen wear hazmat suit protect yourself. Back work loser, handouts. Whats consensus taking paracetamol avoid symptoms vaccine (im AZ today heard quite tough young people) reduce vaccine efficacy?  They're ridiculously underpaid compared American doctors  Nope, time waste yours, less time waste someone else.  Heck yeah! Can't wait til get vaccine! Hahahaah hitting way COVID lol find hard believe. Doctors treated respect Canada feel like I’ve seen brought million times already might well placebo shot

yeah... no. 

It works quite well UK, based constantly falling number cases. problem: skyrocketing house house Zealand

idk feels like ""anticipating"" one decade Tell more! love music history It’s definitely looking way. remember Ticketmaster tossed idea ( sure going anywhere) basically either negative Covid vaccine knows it’ll happen I’m it. bend mask wire nose correctly, makes almost air tight seal (as be). severely cuts glasses fog. figured much sure anyone surprised this. No, think around 3 million doses administered per day possible Pfizer Moderna deliver vaccines expect to. I'm state NJ we've got crappy gym owner became nationally famous rebelling COVID restrictions. Yeah, real smart. kind psychopath cavalier people's lives? I’m high risk, state isn’t even going right now. It’s age occupation only. now, even many high risk people getting vaccines. I'm high school teacher Germany quite frankly, people refuse it, sooner I'll able get it.

My arm ready! Obesity also risk factor virus. lead severe symptoms infected.

People please, look old pictures crowds 1970’s earlier. Almost nobody fat. way look normal, it’s interacting negatively diseases. I've wearing chemistry lab goggles (the kind go glasses) since March last year go public places... Glad know looking ridiculous nothing! I’ve started socializing again, mental health skyrocketed. can’t take this. parents vaccinated point...whatever  too! Face shield KN95. husband face shield, happy we've wearing heard study. understand people wear them.  part time work private gym residential building NYC (yes know, choice rent pay)

We strict guidelines: reservations small amount allowed once, masks must worn fully times, temperature checks door, wipe machines every use (which anyway).

It's 100% ideal, outbreaks problems since I've worked there. think difference work gym private building, instead for-profit public gym.

I see people social media certain gyms masks/regulations whatsoever. places obviously give shit. virus endemic us world years. So, yes, get gym, also barber, bar, restaurant, mom's house, mom's house. absolutely everywhere now.

Tell many healthy, under-50, people died?

So we'll wait ""proper"" amount people vaccinated go back real life? What's proper amount vaccinated?  mixing eventually. see data summer believe AZ/Pfizer combo trial. one sounds privileged you. nothing talk people. full I've never heard someone talk someone else's kids much prove point. truth everything covid.

Calling self absorbed, assuming kids. know pain suffering. Ive lived plenty surprised amassed whatever go through. thats point talking about. also ugly thing assume. I'd think someone pretends smart, would better that. 

But tell type needs belittle people internet tower built upon friends live lockdown. bet feel good now. sad though...and honestly nothing pity you. Hopefully one day find better ways make feel significant. fact need rely friends family make odd point shows little think yourself. Perhaps fairly.

I'm tell ya working home same. Traditional injuries ones leave unable like rest life. what's called serious rather uncommon injuries. Traditional injuries, pulled muscles, tendinitis, sprains. know things heal within weeks.

Indoor eating allowed here, basically everything allowed I'm at. hit extreme places. ill keep people power allow do. I'll support local small business gym hopefully keep afloat. provide family. black white like make it. Ill continue enjoy things like abide cdc guidelines local government allows. terrible analogy almost magnitude out. could someone irresponsible use analogy public. Misinterpretations could mean people die. Yeah run outside it’s 20 degrees buy $1,000 treadmill ^^/s Def first one 😅.

Not fair compare post-industrial (is term?) Countries process fully industrializing (or whatever term is. Developing?) He’s getting downvoted added nothing conversation can’t get equal endorphins walking outside it’s -15 degrees outside. everyone luxury room full set weights home either.  side effect. u boom boomed ur pants 😔 say ""places America"" mean ""rich white western European nations"" counting, y'know, planet? Yes, lockdown measures said, i.e. people ignoring quarantine isolation rules socializing family friends. Vast majority restaurants shops remain closed, highly publicized cases irrelevant large scheme things. First all, you’re one inconsiderate people can’t afford spend hundreds, thousands, dollars equipment might even fit homes. forget we’re suffering recession millions still unemployed?

Second, defining “until over?” Herd immunity? Elimination US? Eradication Earth? last pandemic 100 years ago, people still dying every year mutations virus. also took 20 years completely rid world smallpox recent version vaccine. top off, don’t even know percentage vaccinated constitutes herd immunity. I’m EMS worker, first shot back December   experts calling lockdowns flu? haven’t seen anybody credentials recommend this. care use data “polar seasonal” countries, live north, you’re likely utilising data Australia. scientists try create vaccine utilising strains right end flu season (allow much Australian mutation occur creating vaccine) vaccinate side. enough people got vaccinated could theory prevent flu even able start up. Flu vaccines actually extremely effective preventing direct strain transmission I.e someone Australian flu strain coughed face you’ve vaccine beginning flu season it’s likely won’t get sick. causes issue though people don’t get vaccinated flu bounced around population mutates insanely fast nullifying vaccine. Luckily though, vaccines many super powers, one weaken strains mutated outside protection zone. Say virus develops protein looks like L vaccine targets protein looks like K, body sees L protein looks enough like K protein trigger immune response one strong enough entirely prevent infection. hahahaha im ""introvert"" hahaha pandemic gives excuse antisocial prick hahahhahaa cancelled gym membership due lockdowns spring. Im passing gym see bunch people wearing masks, know right thing. bad communicating. I'm starting think responding get practice. people sympathy right cares, I'm self preservation, get hardy workout, go insane want blow brains out. care kill people protecting myself. guy Roman legions Sigh... people don’t understand every word use made usage changed before.

I’m wondering scientific reasoning reluctance Sit people linger. You’ll see fiddling adjusting whole time. may see brief glimpse person, follow one while. going gym nearly everyday since lockdown ended northern virginia. gym taken precautions (uv air circulator, distanced machines, spray bottles, limiting class sizes, etc.) members respectful enough play rules (clean equipment after, social distance). masks optional, nobody problem this. i'll first say health wealth. put restrictions one place promotes provides health, mind body! leave us alone!!! I’d argue FDA one successful examples government agency. countless “wins” year provide backbone accountability things put bodies. mother used work respiratory medicine clinic. told surprisingly high number doctors nurses smoked. scientific professional mean stupid comes health. attribute views reason people's views psychology, think people quite justified simply ignoring say. Developing working prototype completely different set problems manufacturing scale.

Most European vaccine production goes European arms. 500 million us, takes time. country ahead EU comparable scale US, achieved constantly overfunding (polite word scammed) healthcare. Benefit 1 year 100, drawback 99.

Yes, disappointing, disaster like portrayed. There's literally hundreds threads, interviews, articles issues managed go year pandemic without bothering. 

No, lethal pandemic raging uncontrolled good reason go ""fuck it, everywhere now, might well go gym"". Every single interview vaccines talks need 70+% vaccination herd immunity. 

I sincerely hope get sick enough capable walking harming innocent people around you. I'd agree use masks, pretty much everyone use one seems correctly - well covered mouth face fingering mask. lot people dumb. much wearing mask arould chin protect covid? Wait, anyone actually believe official death rate numbers China? wish like here. Dared go back gym August (when numbers de low gyms allowed open). Mask mandate wall, encouraged wear one wall. boulder buddy people wearing masks whole time, everyone else dropping second stepped mats. decided wait turn get vaccinated try again. shame really. many, many factors affecting well virus spreads. means real-world scenarios hard prove measure effect, effect. Discord enought reason European countries available vaccines?

Here Israel 3m vaccinations 2nd dose 30% population.

The USA pushing vaccine pretty hard too. 

Maybe information getting Europe wrong case right, seems odd.

(disclaimer: mainly warmer areas like CA, AZ, etc)

I've seen lot warmer areas right outdoor gym offerings -- like, bunch equipment outdoors things pretty well-spaced out. (obviously, gyms better others)

It's obviously going completely stop spread, since:

* established outdoor activity much, much lower risk factor COVID spread anything indoors
* Surface transmission actually minimal

I feel like _reasonable_ path mitigating lot risk going gym pandemic.

I touch indoor gym 10-foot pole though, even capacity restrictions.

(apart getting gym setup, right prices super marked up, everyone space/a house put stuff in) I'm boat man, broke last may, living alone new country ever since. one person tells go tinder I'm going fucking scream.

***vaccine works perfectly fine it. Don’t even bother reading CNNs Garbo Yeah, trade speed cost.

Israel UK paid waaaaay EU, got vaccines faster.

When trade started bite lots nonsense talked poor old AZ European press, and, incredibly Macron. Right people vaccine currently offered really risk hospitalization dying COVID. are, however, risk developing “long COVID” long term health problems associated mild/asymptomatic cases, vaccine highly effective preventing. Like said comment, think problem officials saying mild COVID incredibly dangerous low risk population need go extremes prevent it. they’re trying complete 180° totally retract statement. It’s like officials said “Masks don’t work” people wouldn’t hoard medical masks however time they’ve saying “If see friends, you’ll get COVID die” year whereas fibbed masks like month. 

Plus strong feeling that, specifically Germany, officials expecting low risk population give even lives vulnerable population vaccinated want “impressive numbers.” low risk population going unless believe COVID legitimate threat them. See? Trump said would gone Easter. go. bet want choice. vaccine available like 80% effective would take that. one option, lots. course would want one works best. We’ve sworn going bars stuff. don’t even know anyone who’s known anyone who’s got covid. I'm referring general effectiveness getting symptoms, severe symptoms require hospitalization. I'm sure definition ""bodybuilder"" lift weights even little bit seriously, can't come remotely close good workout home. Several reasons, acceptance lowest nurses, social workers psychologists. ""scientific professionals"". enough knowledge know things can't put data together. hear ""70% effectiveness"" trial periods faster usual get extremely suspicious. Paired amount people think Bill Gates wants harvest organs recipe disaster.

There also reports many doctors Germany proper education statistics can't interpret scientific papers it. Even many doctors saying vaccines useless dangerous infamous 70% even though decreases hospitalization much higher number.

It's really hard explain though society straight crumbled here. mean politicians openly threatening members opposing parties deport ""home countries"" taken power. nobody bats eye day. Lies everywhere many Germans (other countries well obviously) open sort lies. 

I several patients tell billions (!) people protesting Berlin April '20 (extremely light) lockdown (it around 15k right-wing extremist groups said several billions, can't make shit up) statements somehow stick huge amount people. People believe anything repeat often enough. Mutations around start, since covid eradicated mutations. read link, huge concern. read article reminded advice early march 2020. Wash hands TOUCH FACE. study thinks people wearing glasses less likely touch eyes. like staff get paid enough pretend security guards increase risk exposure Working effectively mask almost impossible. hand even wearing mask, activity causes move around seep virus. mention sweat on.

Honestly, gyms simply work, or, require people sick recovered, vaccinated. politically convenient. favorite part whole story open open sewers back flood place health department came closed covid raw sewage flooding place. 

Most classic Jersey move I’ve ever seen. People choice comes medicine. America problem ever since started allowing pills advertised TV 90s. That's doctor's business, yours. instead people want whatever product spends money media.  actually coin toss mutation good, bad.

It's completely random whether mutation good, bad, indifferent.

However, mutation bad virus, virus dies humans never see it.

If mutation good humans, still seen enables virus spread quickly.

If mutation bad humans, immune escape, higher viral load, higher transmissibility, much likely see it. Last time whole country lockdown last May. There's local lockdowns whenever cases started grow fast, usually able open three weeks.

There's course danger people already fatigued care variant beaten old measures. think people agree death preferable long hauler. means community transmission early January Serbia. clue, found one local mayor thankfully posted That's acronym use - however Google suggests something teaching students poor English skills?

Having school taught people appropriate training appropriate interventions take place (special intensive classes, pairing English-as-a-first-language 'buddies' etc) doubly important them. Oh no, thought complaining gyms needed open saying gyms safe  rhetoric old, post r/unitedkingdom please, here. infections result mutations. That's fact. yeah, right, let's let spread without restrictions. payed 3 times dose, care, factor especially since keep going lock downs cost vaccines.

Also Israel signed agreement Pfizer supply data vaccinated people, felt like experiment people say vaccine make grow tail. better children public schools fighting chance taking exams rather taken private schools? [A Chick-fil-A manager saved drive-thru Covid-19 vaccination clinic traffic backed advanced Germany likes, yet seems discussion. chancellor saying nothing vaccination besides ""pleading patience"" France Czechia Europe whole human body 80% effective preventing hospitalizations without vaccine. 95% top 80% gain 15 points immunity? Gotta keep clicks comin haha anyway told March Fauci masks unnecessary well idk 🤷🏼‍♀️ miserable able go gym. One thibgs look forward post vaccine. seriously awful mental physical. stuff workout home (or space) well... freezing out. country universal socialized medicine fail bad? assumed mutation always bad.

I'm sure sure got this. You’re middle global pandemic extremely grateful highly effective vaccines all, want choice? 

There’s good reason get jab offered you, whether it’s AZ Pfizer, ridiculous snobbishness efficacy going cost lives Germany places people like you. one 84% study? think inevitable it'll *somewhat* politicised...

But complicating factor Europe role EU caused national procurement programmes paused, transferred EU competence (which first - EU control health issues previously) - EU used size buying power ""wait out"" pharma companies.

Got great deal price.

But lousy delivery time months late signing contract.

Then UK started pulling ahead vaxx numbers AZ ran delivery problems panicked baselessly claimed AZ shipping ""quasi-ineffective"" vaccine.

Now people want it.

Bit car crash round, frankly. [Actually quite little Also Plague Inc, hard understand. traced back anywhere anyplace time. article gives gym bad name, fact gyms still one lowest transmission rates sectors. Supermarkets one worst transmissions I've never seen article like one them. assumed mutation always bad.

It's actually coin toss mutation good, bad. Also, USA imposing export ban Pfizer's US manufacturing plants. Scottish study measured effects **after 1 dose**. two dose vaccines. study found Pfizer jab hospitalisation reduction risk 85% 1 dose.

Not think there’s benefit arguing this. already led people refusing good vaccine internet/media sowed doubt. smarter? Take what’s given 

No want government offer choice vaccine take. example governments allow people choose vaccines:

Combine minimal protective measures teacher vaccination there's zero reason open schools.

Not sure study referring though - best I've seen time correlation school closures, problematic since schools tend close time things. I’m really sorry go that. situation think about. pretty awful. Bad example, Spreading Corona like drunk driving causing dozens fender benders occasional serious accidents every car pass. Big difference.

And drinking driving serious consequences caught. saying consequences enforced Corona spread virus?  Plenty random perfectly healthy young people already getting vaccine NYC work public-facing job. It’s like would cutting front bunch 80-year-olds. Connecticut NYC metro area barely even counts vaccine tourism IMO.

Sincerely,

That magical elixir pushed many arm 1, Sorry,.. theres simple answers here. Theres “1 size fits all” solution. 

Asking “what people do!?” ,.. generic asking “what people eat?” 

Each person decide themselves. Look around. Evaluate environment contextual situations you’re make smart decisions. 

Heck,.. even 1 person alone,.. decisions may change need updated day day basis things change community around you. 

Thats part responsibility human (to AWARE INTELLIGENT problem solver). disgraceful pathetic shaming reply difficult subject some. need someone talk (or appropriately listen give advice), try Listening Line SeekHealing 828-547-0222. Call text mean, vaccinate people day California teachers California, really hot bothered opening schools could get first dose day second dose three weeks later (requires Pfizer, Moderna 4 weeks) open 4 weeks. stragglers? Sure, could enough fully vaccinated teachers start process. I'm really concerned doomsday either.

I'm concerned governments respond variants lousy op-ed variants going make us start again, let alone variants themselves.

And we're already seeing first signs unwarranted variant panic Europe, Canada, Australia, UK. seeing posts like makes feel matter end. like seriously highly effective vaccines coming. plus already studies show vaccines stop transmission lot. honestly feels like much progress trying return normal end see articles like this. majority population vaccinated:

1. like flu maybe weaker.
2. almost one die.
3. see need masks distancing. Snap mask reality live urban area, work nurse covid floors, pre covid times gyms go-to stress relief dunno talking about. used go every day 5 heading work. There's lot good ways run around either going gym run treadmill spend time either. Given US doctors best paid witld sob stories getting really old. Especially clearly pretty happy pay play healthcare system.

And UK doctors ""badly treated"" all. thing going one new tech mRNA vaccine traditionally adenovirus type. hang ups rushing cutting edge tech market without long term study may willing get it.

Additionally, know reemergence immunocompromised individuals likely.

Sequencing data point, far explaining exactly what’s going “reinfection” cases. going back gym get vaccinated. even consideration. 

There's way safely gym airborne virus. know he's US? Europe, future looking bleak ever: massive politicization, variants driving fear, poor vaccine rollout, chock-full doomsayers want second Christmas Zoom, on. Canada similar story. covid circulated effects typically kids rest population safe one care it. It’s simply serious virus population hope right friend. Life feels like working spending money. Storage also issue ones needing deep freezer storage. Limiting flu vaccinations sites kind storage would less ideal. +1 stimulants lol. tried go mine summer thinking didn’t need wasn’t going anywhere, boy wrong. Turns they’re thing keeping literally lying bed day. routine involves leaving house makes wonder much agoraphobia I’m going deal suddenly we’re expected get back “normal”... anyway yeah, good luck us all! think still grateful. received 80 000 doses vaccine, we’re even far behind lol. They’re busy frontline healthcare workers right now. 
Hang mate! thinking people givin empty pill told would save died fucked is...  come lazy gym-goers think need spend $100/month memberships, thousands dollars equipment, dedicated personal trainer, stay healthy. Meanwhile folks solitary confinement cells get shredded bare hands iron willpower. need gym stay healthy, wrong.  “”We seeing England even one five children primaries, primary age children highest prevalence across groups,” told BBC’s Sunday Show.”

If one five primary age kids school prove schools problem? anything sounds likely they’re getting school. friend, 30, got last March still hasn’t recovered much all. *Finally* Maybe die Glad hear it. 2nd phase india vaccinate 300 million. rate indian vaccinated 2022(when mean mean anti-vaxxer conspiracy theorists here). allow private companies get full vaccination even early. I’m aware. I’m implying job doesn’t right go calling around employees medical information. city closed gyms 2 months thought going go mad. gym thing keeping sane. Ok even that’s true expect better conditions jail detainees. One question smart people, pared people got original shot specifically moderna, matter vaccine got before? saying explicitly qualify statement ""it appears much likely that"" ""that's understanding, least"". never claimed significant, knew exactly reason was. person asked question, provided reasonable answer. see problem here. I’m thinking end driven insurance companies year two. actuarial data shows unvaccinated people cost insurance companies money, expect raise premiums eligible, vaccinated. don’t expect see EUA, see things heading way.  HIPAA applies medical professionals. BioNTech (a German company) designed vaccine, Pfizer (an American company) one bankrolling manufacturing process. Nurse here! Almost coworkers vaccinated I've heard lot everyone's side effects. people little side effects first dose sore arm. second dose started side effects around 16-24 hours. lot people fevers, chills, headaches muscles aches lasted 4-24 hours. Personally felt like bad cold 3 hours, took NSAIDS felt better. Hope goes well you! don’t deserve anything I’m giving you. cases go less mutations


expect single vaccine targets dominant strain get alcohol cigarettes no-contact minimal without issue. Gyms like...the opposite. Less ""essential"" minimal risk profile (notice bars, alcohol equivalent gym, closed). 

Full disclosure, local gym hardcore masks limiting number people spread there. got first vaccine today, I'm proud it. hope COVID restrictions lifted toward end year. I've social distancing mask wearing staying home, I'm growing very, weary it. hope ends soon year. Smoking pack cigs drinking handle vodka kill 99% time (and others 1% time drunk driving moron).

Going gym, catching coronavirus, spreading everyone around huge chance injuring even killing them. compare risks. moment stop fighting other, that's moment lose humanity.
Another step closer fight virus off. give up, wear masks, practice social distancing get vaccinated turn!! Physical health mental health directly intertwined Better set lunk alarms required wear masks entered gym, point temperatures taken screened symptoms. allowed remove masks exercising; infected likely wear masks infrequently classes, researchers found.

Come man. hell would allow people take masks indoors? 

The article cites two HIIT classes totally see coronavirus outbreaks people unmasked indoors... HIIT lot cardio California, would encouraging outside activities. 

If New York, honestly don’t know. would tell people certain percentage people vaccinated, open different activities, loosen restrictions, on. I’ve gym rat 30 years, haven’t public gym since Feb 2020. way rationalize safe. know comes mouth difficult sets...it’s lot heavy breathing even masks simply cannot wipe everything: weight plates dumbbells examples something touched frequently rarely wiped down.

I invested less $800 equipment home train better before. four exercises every body part, time train, listen music...no problem. already ditched state following cdc guidelines would allow smokers. ~75%?? wait 95% Pfizer one true healthcare/long term residency staff, 65+ people, cops/firefighters first. essential workers. 16+ risks specific severe covid. would guess don’t kind risk actually defined yet. I'm retired flight paramedic, medically retired. benefits. Body busted. saw ad today starting flight paramedics $19/hour.

Find different career Ya honest I’m glad don’t live CA anymore. Hang man. states open pressure increase need see vaccine works it. else know? Guess? really want pandemic go forever? effective, move on, reformulate. going slow vaccination efforts. I'd rather vaccine that's effective variants.

Only way expedite human challenge trials purposely infect people virus. humanitarian political issues. I've going Gold's Gym since Novemeber 6 days week. Full mask usage employees top 1 person saw try use mask. Everyone appears part there. yes I'll continue going unless closed. governor likely going recalled... 
yes 40 hospitalizations county 1/2 million high average age well 40. believed ten year head start working first SARS vaccine helped too. pro truth

It cultist thing say. Call representatives. NY NYC switched NYT editorial board blasted Cuomo giving city 25% indoor dining less two weeks ago it’s already increased hospitalizations deaths falling. get movies back soon fitness centers sued right hold group classes (allowed rest state) bet that’s next. makes new vaccine technology powerful. change vaccine practically quickly virus mutates! Amazing. 

Who knows vaccines can’t cut tight corners like 3 4 years. I’m sure global production mRNA really take years come. soon US taken care people rest assured absolutely overflowing vaccines every friendly nation help. America lot shitty things never generosity deficit. Alcohol withdrawal real thing. know, actually kill you. Cigarettes' I'm sure of. God damn 😂🤣 Covaxin next. #gamechanger Yes. Esp. outer boroughs. grandpa isn’t guaranteed die gets Covid. grandpa would rather go visit friends even risk could possibly get Covid die. Different people different risk tolerances shouldn’t forcing everyone stay inside people afraid belief hearing quite lot lately, people getting access vaccines. totally understand why, would like point problems position.

1. often quoted \~95% efficacy rate mRNA vaccines calculated context conduct participants original Phase 3 trials, circumstances proposing. mean study participants blinded treatment, therefore could assume actually received vaccine. also participating time widespread restrictions social activities well enforcement social distancing mask wearing. Also, prevalence virus population time arguably lower currently, fewer variant strains wild. Consequently, efficacy rate cannot assumed remain conditions distancing mask wearing.
2. Collectively, potential vaccine-resistant mutations develop, rate develop, increase function increased contact infected vaccinated individuals. personal level, may mean much you, population-wide scale, risk cannot ignored. pandemic made abundantly clear placing desires individual safety many precisely why, one year later, continues widespread transmission.

In closing, intent chastise judge; is, all, natural understandable point view common. However, remains flawed reasons, well others. media government (specifically, public health agencies) have, usual, utterly abysmal communicating public educating science. result unnecessary deaths continued suffering. urge reconsider. *leaves mayo radiator ""special"" batch sandwiches* Thanks providing point. Every study shown schools open safely says that’s case SAFETY MEASURES MET. Many schools can’t meet measures. said, people ignore part want opened, even though it’s actually safe certain circumstances. 

And are, saying schools open, safe not. Save screenshots, historical artifacts ur family bore grandchildren 2060. I’ve saved early pandemic texts Plus mRNA vaccines could make better flu vaccine!  Actually, task force allow transfer hospitals nursing homes.

""The guidelines also explain process transferring patients possible confirmed cases COVID-19 nursing homes remember Harris talking specifically AA community. They're well aware abusive unethical Tuskegee trials. trying use position power persuade blacks vaccine ""experiment"". Public health researchers found AA's respond repeated messaging African Americans leadership &amp; scholarship roles, say Dr. Fauci Pres. Biden.

Two deaths knew personally, vast majority fine. couple covid long haulers.

Keep mind Florida warm weather climates surged summer people started gathering indoors air conditioning. last couple months perfect weather spend time outside. Literally near perfect weather, I'm outdoors pretty much entire day night. hope somehow there's magical formula continues protect us, really do. Also remember people, can’t agree shape planet. Don’t give much credit peoples thoughts decisions. important remember black-and-white comes things.

We already know NovaVax JnJ provide least protection SA variant, especially severe disease. means worst case scenario avoided regards vaccines.

The vitro studies taken together really show antibody-mediated immunity less efficacious variants, overall cell immunity seems remain unaffected (see JHU Oxford/PHE studies).

Right, basically mainstream news. important pieces *scientific* news, even generally high quality media sources bad reporting prone sensationalism I'd rather left primary literature science bloggers. ideal world, journalists would report variants concisely clarity, live world. live somewhere locked cannot go outside walk? PA nightmare, 88 89 year old grandparents STILL haven’t gotten theirs, 5 kids hunt get appointments. colleagues found two versions coronavirus increasing frequency: one E484K mutation seen South Africa Brazil, thought help virus partially dodge vaccines; another mutation called S477N, may affect tightly virus binds human cells.
By mid-February, two together accounted 27 percent New York City viral sequences deposited database, Dr. West said. (For moment, grouped together Columbia University researchers took different approach. sequenced 1,142 samples patients medical center. found 12 percent people coronavirus infected variant contains mutation E484K. need Equalizer. Bingo. mention hipaa violations left right. Thank comment whole! Yeah I’ll believe see honestly. agree dude commented to. I’d believed months ago now, it’s becoming apparent places don’t want headache. mention lost profits people aren’t vaccinated can’t come in. live capitalist country. It’s undecided. I’ve seen articles saying opposite. Im generally pretty hopeful, kind think March April rise plateau cases, maybe due variants I'd guess due mobility behavioral changes, cases going vaccinations people likely gather, especially worried spreading aged.

The good news hospitalizations continue decline, continue decline immunity increases. cases rise among young old, Ill satisfied meanwhile company took vacation 17 days sick hell Covid People saying months actually happening hospitals would way swamped. see 7-day average data? see cases went today versus 1 week ago today, every day past 7 days lower case count corresponding day last 7 day period. mean, level yeah. pandemic taught us anything need better prepared next one. i'm hs-er california, set foot campus since march worked great. Thanks saying that. missing something? sub doesn’t really seem dooming way everyone says is? Every thread look at, one person overly cautious gets downvoted everyone else arguing opening immediately. see happened LA December? UK time? Yes even though content spending 90% free time alone. 
I really missing 10% would spend others. 
SO ya fared better sure, man pint wings bar would nice. countries paid more, signed contracts earlier, negotiated deadlines. EU dicked around paying less signed worse contract. STOP ALREADY. Coughing rare. Speaking creates large ballistic droplets time. Test glass surface.

Speaking matters transmission, aerosols, ballistic direct droplets, fomites. scroll bottom see but: 

 “These things little bit less well controlled vaccine, it’s orders magnitude down, would terrify me,” Dr. Read said.

As virus continues evolve, vaccines need tweaked, “but scheme things, aren’t huge worries compared vaccine,” Dr. Read said. “I’d say glass three-quarters full, compared last year.”

It's good identify variants learn them. like used strike unnecessary fear. vaccine still effective it, even less so, still extremely important. Checkmate, Fauci!  Strawmanning win argument. Ah, Spring measures. much current ones suck, can't equal absurdity taken last Spring. Pretty sure one Pfizer Phase III's SA (but SA strain dominant), still following folks, likely good field data relatively soon. feed trolls. downvote them. read originally info.

Yes sucks.  experience, almost difference two groups acting anyway. vaccinated getting back something resembling normal, unvaccinated wait turn. It’s bizarre watch people know go hesitant get out, sudden seeing happy pictures eating others vaccinated. OK/TX area wide open businesses.

Totally irresponsible. Three months long time school kids. waaaay casually flushing rest year toilet.  vaccines still work antibodies resistant variants? Quoted LA times: “In Phase 3 trial, Pfizer vaccine 100% effective Black study participants 94.5% effective Latino participants, slightly 94.7% effectiveness white subjects. addition, 74.4% effective Asian Americans, 100% effective Native Americans Pacific Islanders. Among people described multiracial, 10.4% effective, one case COVID-19 among got vaccine one case among got placebo.” entirely Employers never given shit employees pandemic, care get covid would care vaccine? trust front lines help ELL students, faced issue *before* pandemic daily basis, *while actually school building*...right? Today monday. 7-day average went today. know. know grant applications precise, probably lot grant apps backed up. Since included Surfaces grant, needs new grant app.

And decided long ago paper needed thrown away. N95s cleaned specific machines, cloth washed least daily. think many people work hospitals take clothes immediately shift put washer. can't imagine people wearing clothes mask 3 days toxic environment--maybe non-believers do. really not. human nature. Look expectation bias.  vaccinations UK started reduce deaths reduction hard lockdow, vaccinations stop another wave (hence gradual opening up).

If UK anything go already kind fucked, fucked going measures taken. 
Covid takes week symptoms show, two weeks ill hospital, two weeks death. treatments improved people take longer die. variant threat going manifest, would expect see localized explosions cases somewhere first. I'm watching news every day. far big decline weeks weeks.  Last monday holiday. 7 day average still trending downward. One case per month limited attendance. go in...what happens. narrative safety fiction. ...what? troll? why? think differently you?

What think media telling us Iraq WMD? believe then?  average corvid lasts 10 days variant lasts also possibly spreads usual isolation 10 days.

Shouldn't CDC change back 14 then? Israel actually vaccine many them, regardless. addition, Palestine declined Israeli vaccines favour buying nations. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) doesn’t mean stop social distancing, though. can’t socially distance, wear mask courteous. 

How many people last year killed careless friends family? unless like 1 shot vaccine perhaps milder side effects. someone forced it. full vaccination I’m wearing mask. would mandated? kidding said mRNA technology going revolutionary.  makes lot sense realise EU France Germany's pet political project. 

The EU underperforming Brexit Britain obviously got upset, presented existential threat political project proud. tried diminish UK's achievements lying saying UK stole doses EU. proven load bollocks, French claimed AZ 'quasi effective' German government leaked '8% effective 65s'.. Utterly baseless time, unequivocally proven false hard data. hard look anything right positive light. Corona bad news bad news, family and/or friends passing away. regulars bad things happening life seem 10 fold harder pandemic well. know it’s hitting everyone it’s hard people there. Estonia doesn’t immunity didn’t many cases. might 5% immunity natural infection vs US 35-40%, plus US done twice many vaccines. So, know term herd immunity loaded one, UK France US certainly lot immunity Estonia, seems like we’ve reached tipping point. Yeah, doubt travel year. usually take three trips year state, it’ll still dangerous. daily corporate propaganda. Always Name one single way vaccine situation different Biden trying help push taking whatever fastest way back ""normal"". Personally feel farce. People say better help population whole, true \~10% (or more) end long covid. Who's going take care people can't work contribute society? 

Right J&amp;J give warm fuzzy feeling. I'll hunting mRNA shot turn. Nah we’re done shit regardless mutations. I’ll take chances. paying monthly via loan. sales make less dev (had motivations pay) still think $18k bargain. don’t buy argument see data. think people unwilling take vaccine safety concerns lack incentive so. Every single person know read online anti vax don’t believe it’s safe messaging isn’t going make worse better. vaccinate them. I'm really curious vaccination strategies used approach target high risk ppl ppl higher prone spread covid19. Administration slowed down, deliveries appear caught back winter storm. Garbage arguable, over-dramatized pretty spot on. daily podcast needs suck back listen. stated news read AP press releases nobody would tune in. cadence, story design, interviews, many aspects build drama make every story is. used listen daily, stopped read news. Mental health much better I'm probably informed. One issues humans inclined pretty black white things, things we're talking anything - they're complicated, solutions suggestions imperfect, people talking sides varying levels ignorant, afraid, overconfident, paranoid. 


This bad situation people trying make best of, including scientists. yeah, epidemiologists going base suggestions worst case scenario often than, say, economist situation that's job - realistically see worst case scenario happening. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's like someone else said - meteorologist err side saying rain, say people even upset.  


I think that's media experts right - adding people might make bad decisions based misplaced optimism longer trust optimism turn wrong. easiest contact tracing inside home. Obviously know names people.

Which pissed last fall Dr Drew kept going “there evidence restaurants spread virus”.

Well....something community spreading virus it’s making way people’s homes. It’s huge stretch want remove one activity people go don’t wear masks. outdoor dining may better, restaurants put tent 4 walls. think truth also think people taking pessimistic stance optimism beaten year shitty news. one wants a-hole gets someone sick

Have met average American? Key word allowed ordered barred. Coumo that. Didly squat appart reading comments reddit poor infrastructure coupled fast production rate Yeah EU aren’t covering glory right now. knew botched vaccine negotiations in-fighting could cost lives! really can't remove wider European geopolitical context either.. 

The UK beating EU comes solving first crisis since Brexit happened. bit, either. Absolutely trouncing them.. 

It terrible optics. 

The EU, many European politicians went hard AZ vaccine delays announced. Much harder logical, given 'at cost' vaccine they'll still getting many many millions doses even reduced capacity. 

They even attempted good old fashioned 'perfidious albion' conspiracy theory, regards saying thought AZ smuggled EU vaccine UK (total lie).. 

They everything could somehow make UK's success, really success. end, went far claim vaccines UK using, work. 

Again, totally baseless rubbish. 

And they're suffering consequences actions. people aren’t vaccinated won’t long time? think medical officials recommended getting vaccine 200 times.... Sure, could entire time. Museums, sight seeing, shows, sporting events, restaurants / bars fully opened, aren’t exactly possible. CNN declared fake news right course. minimum, changes HVAC systems increase ventilation filtering, increased cleanings sanitation building, temperature screenings entering buildings, quarantining anyone exposed someone tests positive, mandatory face masks, kinds things. know basically impossible keep students separated six feet apart. high school went to, hallways shoulder shoulder classes. Classroom sizes continued grow budgets education not, there's money available schools budget stuff (for part). 

This require binary thinking though. We're choosing closing schools entirely fully open normal operations. classes really taught remotely. Others much (such labs). could also alternate days students class Mondays Wednesdays, students class Tuesdays Thursdays. Fridays reserved activities require students present everyone else learns home. 

You could also make changes school schedule open longer number hours day give time people get class class groups. Instead bell ringing 2000 students piling hallways time shove past get next class, could instead released alternate classrooms. go lockers get books next class convene common area (like big cafeteria something) there's room people spread little bit. next bell rings second batch students gets goes class. third bell ring students waiting go classes. Thus reducing clutter hallways making people cram together quite tightly.

I'm saying ideas great even practical, changes made make things little safe one change time. reduce chance spread gives time catch infected people become symptomatic, minimizes number people symptomatic person could infected. There's way (as said) make something perfectly safe, improve slow spread rate give us time.

And course student pre-existing health condition family member especially vulnerable allowed distance learn much possible. forcing people go school risking killing relatives, require learning.  💵💵💵💵💵

It’s already 94 percent effective real world studies. Yeah, poor sharecroppers rural Alabama. honestly saying reasonable think federal government is, right now, marking separate vaccine boxes black people instructing multiracial group health care workers give black people placebo vaccine? think reasonable think black person going CVS get vaccine given fakes part conspiracy? really, that's cherry picking tabloid headline.

The reason US UK ahead also fact governments held collaborative relationship manufacturers right start including giving stronger commitments way back June, building domestic supply lines advance, providing rolling reviews trials approving faster almost anyone else. facts also likely included contract - return level collaboration, UK put population first AstraZeneca. That's export controls far punitive. collaborative pragmatic. Besides, EMA approved AstraZeneca vaccine weeks back point US UK already miles ahead.

Secondly, comparing Denmark (5m) completes drive UK (60m) valid comparison. smaller population within developed country course going quick. Denmark countries population size compare Israel UAE. UK's benchmark France, Germany Italy due similarly sized populations economies.

Thirdly, think premature suggest EU better Australia, Japan Canada. countries relatively less impacted Covid therefore urgency vaccination drive lower. Certainly Australia Japan waiting watching.

Lastly, point comparing Scotland wanting leave member state wanting leave wrong. Scotland constituent member nation state. EU quasi-international body - leaving one fair comparison. comparing Scotland leaving Bavaria leaving Germany? Catalunya leaving Spain. outright deemed illegal constitution. would least arguing good faith. Schools don’t enough money pay improvements even state feds allocate capital outlay project retrofit HVACs schools, pandemic far work completed. Or.... objectively good idea! 

See misuse word ""objectively""? Lol last time Americans ""came together"" illegally invaded 2 countries still illegally occupying 20yrs later. indeed shows absolute number cases rising every 10 days even total number cases US sharp decline. Specifically month January. 

Cases peaked US around 10th January fallen drastically since. chart shows doubling B1.1.7 variant period. suspect decline shown first February incomplete data. last collection date February 8th. SA variant dominant transmissible current dominant strain. South Florida may way -idk haven’t recently. I’ve panhandle, Jacksonville, Orlando Tampa recently people seemed care Covid. good news, here's hoping works get arms fast. fucks young people high risk conditions. Hopefully somebody sues them. make **mild-moderate disease** bold? Considering deadliest health crisis facing US chronic morbid obesity, best served keeping gyms open. used word “do*mer” got warning lol consequences ignoring far come considering far go. 

Look depression rates across entire western world. Look many Americans convinced country horrendous. Look upset angry makes people. 

I think need look *both* directions. recognize far we've come still want improve. thing make happy perfection, we're lot unhappiness it'll never happen. 

I think something going wrong America easily top 10% best countries live meanwhile half country convinced awful. need bring things back perspective  government really use equipment things like this, FEMA initiatives like disaster relief. contract existing logistics companies get done. problem throw capacity market ""semi trucks"" completely its' ass government sucks truck capacity pays rates per mile inflate market. Add recent winter storm let's say hate job right now. ""few"" mean majority Americans lose employment income past year.

I think closer half country. layoffs: furloughs, lost retirement matching, cut benefits, salary reductions, spouse leaving work deal remote school, etc. people lose job entirely mean take significant financial hit.  missed news.about ""mRNA vaccine"" is?

Not mention vaccines regularly get ""minor versions virus"". right many ways think see media erring side doom - we're unsure, we're used bad news, would malpractice part come early say ""vaccines they're rolling we're gonna free June!"" - variant emerges boom, then? ""fake news""? cries moving goalposts? 


There has, year, lot bad news based good data - right people even sub take sign good news done deal try reject sign bad news.

&amp;#x200B;

I think part symptom problem - see us better virus, maybe makes sense assume that's life get it. knew, confident, we'd summer - might tolerant - wants promise we're unknown territory? birds family! Indian can't use fast enough I've heard. sitting shelf Bizarre looking back numbers beginning seeing like “239 people got tested March 20th NY.” we’re putting 6 digits norm. Makes feel lot comfortable numbers dropping makes wonder many people virus never tested early on. We’re given 2nd per capita large countries, 5th overall. guess complain haven’t given many UK, means 190 countries us even worse. Credit credit due, US good job vaccine distribution.

As far hoarding - directive CDC ensure coverage second doses. think change, isn’t ‘hoarding’ One beverly surgeon got someone's lips filler. died. Well fast. back allowed government. Unfortunately government allowing full capacity events take place. started unprecedented, nonsensical claim someone finally realized even 100% effective vaccine won’t (can’t) stop person “testing positive” PCR test, decided protect skins expense telling truth.

If vaccines actually work well we’ve told do, actually generate neutralizing antibody formation “at level natural infection” like studies showed did, no, cannot “still spread it.” may still test positive, people around may still test positive...meanwhile, you’ll “asymptomatic” (which used saner times call “being healthy”.). never history diagnosed “case” anything via genetic test pathogen ITSELF....hence giant, muddled mess. Unless CT lung. cant see Whoa, crunch fitness house really crowded outdoor space. almost zero masks. Lots dudes ripped shirts and/or shirts though.

I go there, drive it. What? whole sub, lots European leaders, FDA whatnot moaning AZ vaccine weeks.  5) Turns whole lot COVID spread coming healthcare workers, vaccinating late December / early January cut cases dramatically.

I convinced, intriguing idea. actually saying contradictory things. HVAC systems danger spreading virus, calling ventilation would actually causing rather inhibiting spread. either good air ducts moving air rooms isn't. can't ways. staff staff transmission school took chairs teachers lounge. one gathers lunch more. there's one upside hope fixation cleanliness germ killing improves horrifying statistics I've heard past many people wash hands bathroom. I’m situation. Eventually stop thinking people’s opinions life choices matter. 

Do really care think? might helping mental health either. heart. don’t know anyone’s story. everyone good enough health live risk. US developed role developing Pfizer, Moderna, Johnson Johnson vaccines. Also UK taking vaccine EU, stop making stuff arse.  TLDR, five people appeared reinfected, though two five slight symptoms first time (ie three (hell even five) could’ve false positives) gym membership $25/month - insurance covers half it.

So yes, definitely cheaper. 

I *have* trying get home gym options house, elliptical want stock months available April, apparently. analogy sound. think /u/Texden29 intentionally trying miss point. idea you’re downvoted. article taking 2 locations portraying what’s happening entire country. thousands cities haven’t significant outbreaks related gym reopenings? didn’t mention that? Absolutely nothing. Read account's post history pathetic mess vitriol stupidity. 

Just vote move on. commenting based headline. Article paywalled me. risks getting fat herpies. risk another 500,000 people dying. think we'll see little baby boom pandemic starts seriously wane. like couples planning families want anymore; they've put hold. March, 120M doses delivered across 3. We're torrential stream. comes time ramp admin. get 3-4m per day March run absurd level rule following. government know make rules?  things vacation besides go bars restaurants. us actually go vacations get away people! Yes! There's actually lot said that. 


Think Fauci others similar positions: Everyone sub (well, everyone, that's hyperbole) wants clear solid timeline reopening - many believe matter what, we're never going allowed go back normal. 

 
The reality complicated. ""Fauci says cannot hug grandma!"" - reality, Fauci's gonna say Grandma safe vaccinated he's SURE. That's scientist. 

&amp;#x200B;

Same reason see vaccines ramping adults vaccinated summer hear ""We may maskes 2022!"" - know could happen, able see scenarios that's reality.

&amp;#x200B;

Everyone right concerned they'll admit things getting better know could theoretically change - variant etc - could make people suddenly throw masks throw parties enough vaccinations.  


I say agree messaging, think conspiracy theories see perpetual lockdowns scientists ""enjoying"" ""new normal"" portly people understand - can't comprehend - actual reasons say say.  


Which also feel strongly communication value. Think Depression US. economists giving Fireside Chats, FDR speaking directly people?  


There's balance, we'll better find it. Well quite, UK ordered Janssen, Oxford, Pfizer, Novavax, Moderna. majority vaccines far administered Pfizer.

The UK still better protection B.1.351 almost every country world right now.

And again, remember efficacy based 23 cases control, 19 vaccine, small sample. Always double check sources. Often good articles, I've seen least one poorly sourced. Israel lockdown. Lmfao sure downvoted. getting 2nd jab within 2 weeks plan travel internationally. Maybe New Years Eve.  bad whole COVID thing turned political battleground. many people used pandemic political goals level paranoia fear mongering that's control. Totally control. 

I'm thinking virus might fade away sooner, rather later.   fuck Moderna / Pfizer going deliver doses end March increasing doses 14M week... need deliver 25M week starting week even meet shipping dates... Every 10M doses short means another 10M need made throughout rest month... Reads like singles ad

""find hot COVID vaccines area"" British-Swedish pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca everything increase production corona vaccine. CEO Pascal Soriot tried convince European Parliament hearing. explanation delivery vaccines UK much smoother EU appeal MEPs.

On Thursday, parliament invited representatives seven companies European Commission concluded contracts supply corona vaccines. ""This world first,"" said chairman Public Health Committee, Frenchman Pascal Canfin, start.

Most attention went AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot. company supplies significantly fewer vaccines agreed Commission, deliveries UK seem going smoothly. ""The reason supply lower expected actually simple: production lower,"" explained Soriot. ""The production vaccine biological process requires learning phase.""

While production increasing rapidly one site, slower another. ""Our experts go site site maximum right now. confident productivity soar second quarter, ""said Soriot. AstraZeneca produces around 100 million doses per month, double April.

Europe ahead British vaccine deal
Contracts

Regarding contracts United Kingdom European Union, said British government became involved vaccine developed together Oxford University January / February 2020. London also invested development, European Union, according Soriot, pumping money production.

He stated production site Netherlands originally reserved British market, also produces EU. ""Regardless, vast majority vaccines produced EU going European market,"" said. around 65 million people living UK 450 million EU, even complete transfer UK production Europe make much difference, Soriot noted.

His explanation failed convince MEPs. ""You like bar soap: impossible get grip on,"" said Finnish Silvia Modig (far left). According Esther de Lange (CDA), story Soriot rattles sides. ""If UK EU contracts signed practically time, 60 percent less deliveries EU? Soriot still want explain even today, ""she told Dutch media.

According Belgian Sara Matthieu (Groen), Soriot's explanation also excelled vagueness. ""I mainly heard pharmaceutical companies trying increase capacity, (heard) little concrete perspective. However, solution obvious. companies temporarily forgo patents share know-how, manufacturers around world produce vaccines. ""

**Moderna**

In addition AstraZeneca, Moderna also fire recent weeks lagging deliveries. Flemish Minister Health Wouter Beke (CD&amp;V) said last week knew ""nothing misery"" company. Ceo Stéphane Bancel told MPs Thursday clear outset large-scale supply corona vaccines would prove biggest challenge.

""Because every dose vaccine critical pandemic, store anything. every obstacle, pump breaks human error made, immediately leads fewer deliveries. deliveries going week week, ""it said. think bad indoor sports like basketball volleyball lots places right now. FYI. They're making kids wear masks playing basketball here. Looks miserable tbh haha. amount people straight SOFT mask wearing eye opening.   ""bawwwwwww can't wear waaaaaaarm.....bawwwww awkward breath in""

no mental fortitude people claim can't workout one on. Weird everyone ignoring this. 

I think lot people thinking ""pro-gym"" crowd saying regardless people COVID infection, ""safe"" gym. one saying all. things considered, interesting order events happen, people isolated class, hour plus, without masks, working hard spread virus. question is, people general gym area (the big open space machines equipment are) also spreading much this? kind questions ask next, go ""OH WELL IS! SHUT DOWN!!""  Agreed! 

I rarely leave house days, occasionally visit grocery store need pick things, otherwise groceries delivered. 

My state mask mandates, barely covid restrictions. *most* people see grocery store wearing mask. ones wearing masking usually 60-70 year olds don’t believe COVID real. 

Well...the one person saw wearing mask day pregnant 30ish year old woman. don’t understand that...even don’t think COVID big deal...why wouldn’t wear mask *just case* protect child 🙄 3-4 months gonna saying wait another 3-4 months. Fall saying hunker winter. shit never end. conspiracy make money testing, correct. could disagree? vaccine

We're seeing decline Canada yet we've run vaccine 2.5% vaccinated. necessary. mutations affected vaccines well, need booster? No-one died JNJ trial though. know there's wide error margins in-vitro studies suggesting still protect severe cases along live evidence like still good news. 5% chance bad outcome happens. tragic story spreads like wildfire news social media. 

Now people trust authority figures all. something that's played many times before. getting low enough, need reassess understand thing us.

It's simply death avoidable, that's simplistic closed way looking it, small limited deaths getting back normal. greatest outcome overall let deaths occur we, dunno, tank fucking economy even worse leaving people unemployed worse mental health, better outcome greatest number people. thought FDA approved emergency use yesterday important difference EU Canada, Australia Japan EU developed viable vaccines. Heck, probably best covid vaccine created EU. vaccination rates EU much lower US UK, then? EC messed up.

The US flawed democracy. presidential elections mess unfair. Ironically enough, issue also abbreviated EC. Yes, senate unfair. two-party system lousy. true. separate issue. Again, I’m asking think it’s bad pandemic. It’s kids, don’t really get sick. It’s outdoors, generally pretty safe. It’s going mostly districts already otherwise in-person, it’s adding much additional risk also sports. 

People absurd view amount risk intolerable. Kids need live lives. No, mixing things purpose. talking vaccination. Advocating perpetual stay home orders/lockdowns vaccination problem here.  restrict people’s lives next 5? 10? 15? Infinite years Zero risk covid? Insanity Working heat ac every actively used room old school wishful thinking. always broke. knew gonna great day announcements morning say bring jacket class think pretty big deal also cataclysm told. It’s definitely nasty virus led lot premature deaths frail, deaths healthy. also wasn’t anywhere near horrifying originally modeled.

There people fantastically flight, financial otherwise. people try damnedest keep flying long possible. Usually, disruptions HS sports pandemics.

If recall correctly, previous pandemics (H1N1 2009, HIV 1980's, Hong Kong flu 1960's) significant disruptions sports. Thanks man! I’ll say it’s created new kind camaraderie city. People there, friends dude corner bodega beyond, seem understand went something singular. Glad healthy. Good luck! US 10-11% excess mortality across 2020 got 30% infected. bet you’re around same. You’ll see cases falling soon. ones? can't address possibility go cycle again, nothing else matters, people simply settle that. think bad times there's pandemic, people need learn there's something important happening world. Maybe people take minute read many people died COVID-19 educate racial injustice happening America. get back sports get pandemic. Meanwhile ridiculous hygiene theater wiping surfaces continues, air circulation ignored

Hell, **while credit cards cash handed back forth!**  worst thing happen people learn nothing pave way even worse pandemics near future. Unfortunately, think exactly happen. supply strips capacity distribute, oversupply. 

India currently poor infrastructure distribute. That's they've distributed 12m doses, despite making way way that. 

The Serum institute 100m dose per month capacity.. Even aren’t false positives, can’t extrapolate data nursing home residents fit general population. Nursing home residents much likely average person develop appropriate immune response based average age general health condition typical nursing home resident. Wear mask stay home!

Trying hermit going places mental health. put ease so. Wish well! need massive study prove prevents severe disease. 99,9 people 40 go hospital vaccinated not. mainstream networks coronavirus subs, particulartly one, love doom gloom. never reported recoveries anything good whole entire time.  says he's already feeling better think anxiety gotten better him. report back though! correct, showing disconnect school boards schools. doubt happen. become addicted bad news? 

Asks child [parent happily pushes said bad news variety outlets daily basis. 500K dead Americans, failures leadership people right thing. ""buhhh can't miss trip Sturgis/Spring Break/Thanksgiving/Christmas/whateverthefuck!"" eradicating anything, fucking weak can't distance wear masks little longer. we're used bad news 

I've telling friends family rely single source broadcast published news. Yes, continue watch usual programs, use guide things look versus sole primary source. News mentions vaccine ready - take word it, look up. Use news programs ""bullet point list"" things want research. news item interest you, look up. doesn't, bullet point left another day. all, share news item spent least 5 minutes looking confirm independently. certainly hope wearing masks feeling well remains normalized society. ...
My brother wrestling months now, huge match weekend see makes states. ""Accidentally"" break glass. I’m glad ability act like that. Tough shit us don’t. big thing things really really really bad &amp; vaccine sight, lot people still didnt care, kept whatever wanted, &amp; created even worse situation 

now start talking everything going back normal, everything fine, people double selfish, people jump bandwagon ""it's finally over!"" &amp; people fuck us they've done every step way

a vaccine magic bullet, doesnt mean everything goes back normal second get it. worry lot people mistake optimism reason stop cautious

for example, know couple IMMEDIATELY went vacation getting FIRST shot suddenly felt safer. that's works. &amp; work medical field. also know teachers, friends, &amp; family refusing get vaccine. would say it’s *extremely* unlikely. report back gets test results back, though. SKY FALLING STAY HOME REEEEEEE Top 3 headlines CNN right now:

\-Nurses quitting due pandemic

\-Global coronavirus death toll surpasses 2.5 million

\-New coronavirus variants found New York City

And then, acknowledge good news, case heard somewhere else, want make sure know still going die need check every 5 minutes:

\-Despite US Covid-19 cases dropping, infections still staggeringly high. Here's experts worried.

This kind stuff contributed caring much anymore. I'm ready live life continuously taking steps direction.  actually see, moment, conservative perspective blown proportion furtherance unrelated goal.  mean, CNN news outlets unquestionably that. lol basically knowingly spreading COVID time also taking away vaccine someone needs more. Kudos, went full ret\*rd, never go full ret\*ard. Congratulations! look, that's nationwide trend, I'd bet we're seeing slight leveling cases super bowl parties. really horrible time, weren’t there, it’s hard understand. Glad you’re us better. I'm guessing within 3-5 years we'll see new generation flu vaccines effective base, reconfigured mid-season rapidly deployed effectively wipe flu. 

The one positive pandemic really accelerating lot technological gains medical field. think they're mainly talking want rule anything significant spike winter they're saying may need reassess autumn.

Vaccination make fully immune still know full extent new strains. people should’ve vaccinated week 1.

In Week 1 here, mostly hospital staff vaccinated, including largely-work-from-home administrators. 26th April excess mortality 14% higher usual. general average mid-march second week may. whole period serious lockdown well, period streets completely empty. mid-november onwards high again. Right 15+ percent test results come back positive. still going on? remember seeing video early pandemic around February March, sufficient data knowledge COVID-19 airborne. DeSantis plan trying say since *some states* bad plans, okay plan. California, tiers State waiting every single person tier get shot moving onto next tier. certain percentage tier vaccinated, move next tier. Nothing going waste vaccine held back. We're organized logical distribution vaccine. People healthy getting vaccine people really need it. making BS cover terrible job. almost year, really care anymore. Unless live high risk person contact high risk people (I'm not), people need live lives.

Life not, never been, risk free. Living life bubble never get sick way live. think kids sports bad? Here's else need..............................toknowtoday fuck?  ""It's holdover earlier days flying. Really apply anymore"" lie? really truly believe safety measures like escape slides life rafts holdovers earlier days flying? 777 engine literally catastrophically failed last week. blatantly dishonest point save face. give school money something specific they'll use something else. school fundraiser new football equipment following year, summer break used remodel entrance school. job involves physically present. 

You literally got done telling everybody else 'go get different job.' apply you? way we’re going get necessary herd immunity reduce spread work places employers mandate it. 

Categorically incorrect. We're near HIT right broad swaths country. extreme downward case hospitalization trends started weeks widespread vaccine It’s blind hysteria. 

It's textbook definition blind Covid deadly disease 

For specific subset population. Oklahoma, example, 95% deaths people 60 serious comorbidities. 40% EOL care LTCs.  greatly reduces risk spreading contracting covid. 

Sort defeating argument here. scared get vaccine, protected. nothing me. shouldn’t vaccine required employees? 

For one, EUA. two, HUGE ethical moral issues tied mandating vaccines. Man sub going like this. Thank you!! Wishing best family well :) Well thats bizarre. im eating alone talking someone else usually eat continually? dont take 5 minute breaks in-between bite.  saying we'd stay home time. Cmon states, better know it. Let's hope reporting lag, 1.8 million nearly week terrible numbers nothing. healthy person likely end sniffles get vaccine interact people? Whereas someone may end ICU high flow oxygen barely walk restroom without collapsing they're overweight interact lot people? Yeah, makes sense. Depends where. American can’t go Japan see girlfriend unless open tourism vaccinated people least. Luckily America hasn’t stopped Japanese people coming here. I'll wear mask asshole involved everyone else's business impact me, sorry trying get rise it. 


But want talk shitty others? OK game. work public sector bars restaurants, plenty work large events too, obviously work shuttered. Unfortunate ultimately happen. 


What happen? Pieces shit get work home site others talking others like like plague rats simply industry. POS come demand things us, side mouths say stay shut however long takes sit asses cushy work home programming jobs whatever. 

Quack experts goddam touch go news stations write articles talking ""new normal"" (the fucking idiotic set words last year) straight faced say need distance close businesses years come. Where's concern livelihoods? lives? Oh that's right, people write posts like actually give shit us you? plight matter, thing matters people getting sick virus.

Oh unless someone gets use us example rail capitalism weird grievance nothing COVID, ""care"", whatever. 

I taking seriously last year, much probably think that, actually have. I'm getting close done. I'm going treated like shit work public, dining coming back means people say ""immoral"" literally fucking job pay bills (this actually happened recently, yes apparently supposed ""take stand"" reopening) 

I'll mask place asks it, that's right. I'm around friends I'm Vaccinated one wants wear mask, make let make me. tolerate distancing I'm vaccinated. seeing others, lot. also remember governmental reopening plan business...my vote allocated accordingly. clients start speakeasy style business? report that's takes survive. 

It's funny, ""harm others"" comment interesting....no one given shit harmed here. really getting jaded point care? state 63% 70+ age population vaccinated watching numbers, already fading fast.  think asking metrics reopening occur unreasonable question. least think hear ""endgame"", lifting restrictions. really side argument want on? want people think okay go back normal fully vaccinated &amp; people around vaccinated? work medical (premature babies &amp; elderly people PT), got first, rest us still vulnerable &amp; there's proof vaccine stops contagious others, may turn carrier 

that attitude exactly we're situation begin with. know many people went vacation past year reasoning. several teachers &amp; brought back kids &amp; teachers. 

plus variants dont work well vaccine want help spread variants boosters available amount actual sick people method detect agree put use? 

It's like checking fever method used identify people sick. Looks like CDC rolled back update? Back 66.5 mil admin. US specific, realize Biden wants nothing open country make look good? really think Biden wants ever associated lockdowns fragile political scene right now? Yes, don’t like wearing mask. uncomfortable me, I’m certainly going sneeze cough mask put back face. I’m really sick will
Stay home. sneeze cough public turn away people. That’s that’s needed I've 1 serious Covid patient last month. November December going 5-7 extremely serious Covid patients every shift. I'm Indiana Covid numbers dropping like rock since early January currently back think anyone gives damn people going gym getting sick dying. people infect go supermarket wherever deserve it. Almost reporting internet fueled Ad revenue, doom generates clicks, fear misery business model internet. am. People keep telling need take vacation go somewhere keep asking go? want metal tube breathing re-circulated air right now. Seems like dumb idea. could drive somewhere want go restaurants I'm gone. I'm keen staying hotel knows kind plague person next room has. supposed get there? Tourist destinations great option moment. WTF go vacation right now? Put head sand pretend pandemic? point was, brief moment time (like days) concerted effort Trump administration vast majority media. right wing media challenged Trump (but pandemic team CDC) walked back stance masks. think wrongfully thought one people pushing “Fauci media conspired months mislead public” narrative see constantly sub, bad. Imagine still unironically thinking ""if people followed guidelines would sooner"" think you’re spot on. add it, 7 day average new Cases South Africa 91% last five weeks. dreamed air conditioning band room, money sports instead guess... always unlikely, possible consideration. Also posted quote counter Fauci quote. may given half-optimistic update, CDC still saying vaccine changes nothing, healthcare workers thread saying thing. JFC. ventilation systems rumbled back 75,000-square-foot church, maskless singers musicians onstage led congregation refrain glories audience wore masks. first rows filled elderly people arrived help canes walkers. I’m coughing slightly I’m putting mask on

Why...? really inconvenient put piece cloth face keep making people sick? utterly frustrated government moment.

Only Germans? Western governments proved incapable manage anything degree seriousness. mean Trump gone thats big help. doubt that. Vaccines won’t available children least early 2022. vaccines available vast majority world won’t summer, either. really going take years vaccines available everyone. Weird thing I've actually gotten fever three times 2020 3 time one day bugs. even got COVID tested make sure tested negative. gotten bronchitis even deathly sick like previous years. also wonder flu vaccine played role maybe likely not. Everyone's immune system different get get suppose.... post links please?

Seems like bullshit that's Canadian. not, good luck even getting in. Pfizer yet fulfill US contract. would expect supply Canada additional doses outside contract, especially US made risky early investments ensure production would ready ($2 billion July, guarantees Pfizer drug efficacy).

Apologies, missed that.

I certainly seen anything say supply outstripping demand though unless know differently?

They're moving 60s 1st March suggest supply needed. government allocated enough first second doses states next week average 2 million doses per day (around 15 million total). Add J&amp;J supply, increase weeks go on, well continued increases Pfizer Moderna looking pretty likely we'll well past 2 million per day average within two weeks - barring unforeseen circumstances, course. right...

Yeah private organizations well-known share profits workers. Hello U$A. one wants mandatory workplace rapid tests, people understand NoCovid cry it, lockdowns is.

That said, numbers creeping across Europe even US UK stopped going down. March fun. I'm making shit ton sacrifices pretty much every aspect life right now. Fitness one thing sacrifice. take right now?

Using terminology, vaccinated person “Covidized”, body immediately mount defense.

The virus won’t much opportunity spread eliminated, viral load remain low.

Socially Inept Reditors* know several Introverts IRL much miss partying lol Plans overrated anyway. /s 66 years old, go gym one reason. swim mile several times week. don’t touch surfaces, doors, desk, countertops. wouldn’t dare much walk locker room, much less use it. get pool make sure splash plenty chlorine ladder getting pool. I’m masked times except water, don’t get anywhere near within 6 feet another person. go times, often pool myself. leave back door butt push open without passing single person. I’m wide open field short walk car. 

That high risk activity. It’s competition lap pool, play pool children. front door pool, space wide open completely separate weight rooms, etc. Every staff member masked times, clean place like crazy. come, go. 

Swimming essential mental well-being, 70+ laps like little slice heaven me. Closing gyms bad apples would mean swimming me. 

Close ones can’t follow rules, don’t shut rest us.  mom elementary school teacher Germany, youngest anymore, either. told she‘s vaccine waitlist get date shot soon, little happy dance. take Pfizer one afterwards either way, take (presumably 100% efficient) vaccine safer anyways? mother one Aunts got first shot Moderna yesterday. Although mother skipped line jump line get hers. calling VA weeks making sure list, call younger sister instead come get it. excuse, going alphabetically last name hadn’t made P; aunts last name starts W. Masks go long way actually believe true reporting *effective* restaurant track trace anywhere USA, here's next best want see country hardcore tracking,  I’d like see professional training teacher / child psychologist back statement up. It’s almost others trained understand hmm. Tuesday, two teams reported another variant appears rise fear variant might contagious, may cause severe disease, well. New York reports, research early stages, published peer reviewed, needs work.

Could news least wait science finished? spin class Hamilton, Ontario ended infecting 80 people... 4 months ago, yeah, gyms definitely spread covid. gym fans reply saying ""well, really gym!"" ""but gym special takes every single precaution!""

Problem is, Hamilton spin class probably told clients thing - again, October, already knew lot way covid spreads. used go gym every day work, stopped got weights home exercise instead: quite same, get infected heavy breathers. wish others could give gym addiction easily...

 want overly efficient setting strict systems systems block whole process anything doesn‘t go 100% plan. system worked theory, NEED stick it. You‘d surprised many (minor) inconveniences result culture day day life, you‘ll never hear it‘s nothing big. moderna vaccine well since mRNA, correct? Yes, that’s extremely likely, number people who’ve infected also play role. example, kids vaccinated, lot infected. NJ. put smokers ahead teachers. yes know they’re risk complications I’m tired hearing “open schools” vaccinate teachers. It’s backwards. I’m “walking briskly”. got finished saying people miss gym entitled never bad thing happen judgemental clueless. seems like one complaining you. OK MISS GYM. soon society develops way society becomes capable effectively treating preventing things would otherwise, left play course, would kill member society, longer functioning survival genetically fittest. Simply stating COVID allowed run course society made stronger culling weak ignores dearth things could, theoretically, make future generations stronger treating them, allergies infection.  protocols followed, Chief.  7 year old rough time too. 9 year old misses school social interaction, she’s pretty well academically. 7 year old different story. He’s learning like should. Even helping (while taking care almost two year old). It’s hard little ones learn computer. problem people straight ignoring California first place. like law enforcement actually ticketing people gatherings. remember Newsome caught breaking lockdown protocols, pretty much let cat bag.

So yeah, policy there, California Florida virtually difference compliance. without outwardly complaining understand active pandemic. hate it. hate it? wear glasses. Yes, ways reduce fog, work outside sometimes don’t work temperatures significantly freezing. Also masks make weird keep glasses face. apartment complex live in, walk gym regularly, small, size two normal bedrooms often 3 5 peope there, masks, running treadmills, etc. get logic. Many older / risk age too.

There's even option open doors windows let fresh air in. Nope. breathing other's sweaty breath. Even care covid, let fresh air exercising? Really, literal shit going public health messaging?

I see many fully vaccinated people asking permission dinner another fully vaccinated couple. go party bar. go coughing nursing home. dinner. answer: course not.  
After year finally hug fully vaccinated mom? : Hell no. wait bit longer analyze data come official decision. 10 seconds close proximity 9.9 seconds long. 

take minute actually think that. set people protected ever going covid. Yet answer still masks distancing want chance become potential serial killer. planet make sense?

The woman working Ford’s next ad campaign isn’t analyzing R rates. guy that’s fixing toilet today today isn’t falling asleep papers aerosol dispersal chest.  want know need prepare kids another school year masks, plexi glass, recess. want know throw kids Halloween party year without sneered at. Public health messaging needs start giving people hope. continuous dismissal people wanting achieve “normal” year, two years now, going back fire. really hope so, AZ really covered glory (neither EU), vaccines still work prevent hospitalizations. vaccines we'll better. 180 million would enough quarter EU population, even give first dose second dose deliver rest. 

But I'm quite cautious, I've heard there's room errors AZ's vaccine compared BioNTech's one. good reason AZ wasn’t approved. made lot errors clinical trial protocols failed diverse trial e program. see issues caused played now. People don’t know vaccines works elderly, failed recruit enough folks age 65....which quite frankly deeply disturbing since people hospitalized dying covid. AZ chose withdraw application wait US trial, issues.  Lmao yep. dude higher comments literally said ""all need two dumbbells"". 

Maybe never actually lifted life. There’s hope. kids school announced they’re bringing everyone currently hybrid everyday. Anyone wants stay virtual kids going person. They’re excited! expect year pleasantly surprised. Meanwhile college town yesterday saw ton college aged athletes jogging around campus, every single one wearing mask. Yes, vaccines good! Username checks out. Depends it. decide can't work care home without vaccinated, that's discrimination. offer vaccination everyone takes job care home &amp; someone refuses. choice person refuses. see 89,6 beat 118 . mean, almost strains globally. Yes spread little easily feel like thing mutations greatly exaggerated. son’s birthday May. first birthday Zoom. second birthday party will. not. be. small, yes, several fully vaccinated family members come celebrate him. welcome read. say avid listener Daily, goodness paint far bleaker picture even conservative scientific evidence points sometimes. Well fewer people gym time isnt hygiene theater imo. nonsensical. guys making things fit narrative. Uh what, latest ONS stats directly contradict UK. Germany Oxford vaccine approved people 65 (which means elderly still subject supply shortages before)  many thousands variants. actually concerning, doesn’t stop media fearmongering others. Ah, yes. “Kids resilient”, keep screwing education socialization. We’ve already wasted full year remote hybrid, what’s another three months?

Kids need back schools now. Three months, three weeks, three days, better fraud “remote learning”. Considering catastrophic Autumn Winter numbers established ""Best Covid"" position long new mutation started impact, doubts level responsibility.

It shitshow every level society. It’s wasted vaccines that’s bigger issue. would've kept load meds keep cough fever bay go work anyway.

A days three day President's Day weekend felt cold coming soldier work missing work either Friday Tuesday weekend meant losing holiday pay. yeah, laid entire three days go back work Tuesday.  lucky. playing fire even precautions. stop going.  obviously . Crap masks: reality 
Hope save family—nope 
There goes grampy choked 
He's toe-tagged cold

When goes slack over, yo, that's 
Back cab 
Goin' home mad 
Better go mask moment hope pass it. yeahp going back gyms till vaccinated. Seems smart. Better letting sit helping nobody. Canadians think able create vaccine industry scratch?

Tbf really one group spreading anxiety. Political gains making sure Canadians feel safe taken care of. Getting 70% normal education remotely? There’s way it’s even half. quarter probably optimistic. popularity vaccine matter, available could get can't get appointment... 
Since Astrazeneca approved noticeable decline appointments made increase people showing them. far ""unpopularity"" purely polls, mostly conducted general population aka people might possibly get eligible vaccination sometime summer. lack progress becoming less supply logistical issue. It’s recommended don’t take vaccine. take start getting side effects, don’t pre-medicate.  remember days.. US, states ordering PPE overseas horrible Fed Govt meeting planes touchdown confiscating PPE. lot private citizens ordering masks directly China. Supply mismanagement disinformation norm. There's lot catch-up work done. Well well well. would thought rushing 'approve' vaccine, phase 3 trials started would damage confidence vaccine. /s coverage emphasize threat remains, get lot people vaccinated quickly, get much reflect difficult question. basic issue good news make good news. Bad stuff makes better headlines. less coverage, instance, falling cases rising cases. might time many us assess whether we've developed kind Stockholm Syndrome relationship negative information. addicted bad news?

I think addicted bad news. feeling pandemic bad many people seeming enjoy good news somehow inherently evil. Like traitor cause justice believe good things possible likely coming soon. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* would pretty amazing US used better contact tracing. It’s ridiculous here. 

I know certain Apple app, needs switched on, US never got shit together able utilize features would saved lives. need anew gym yu go back. sounds awful. know it’s fucking pandemic right? Like half MILLION people DEAD United States. close schools .

are serious? options moment, Germany vaccinated 3.4 million people? Either Germany really shit vaccine distribution dont lot stock.  Oh god everything conspiracy. Science science, takes *time* correctly. That's reality ""new studies"" timings. takes infections, analysis, time scientists figure out. 

More information never bad thing. helps us adapt. Notice (if actually read it) results study ""gym bad"", ""poor ventilation, ignoring symptoms/exposure, poor mask compliance working out"" leading causes. worked on. 

Now take make gyms safer. US study came half pfizer half moderna. can't remember compared vaccine independently, pooled efficacy reached expected levels. basically, pfizer news probably applicable moderna too. vaccines almost identical depends many days want average. It’s definitely “opposite” plummeting like saying. absolutely trending downward last days. act like weren’t aware variants possible. highly recommend looking writing articles. One girl background medical field yet gets blow horn cause it’s bad news headline generates views. great advice. Yeah question. Youyang Gu's model good. recently changed wording ""path herd immunity"" ""normality."" looks like we'll get close herd immunity June, plateau rest 2021. normality? bizarre purgatory resembles 2019, people never feel fully safe? going believe British government Lancet? Trust one! end spectrum, gained weight, arms legs turned twigs last year

I 'strong' before, goddamn feel weak excercising year Similar thing happening many parts CA NY. They're ""doomed"", skeptics would believe.   Thank you! That’s good context didn’t time write. Congress peoples lot sway right really need vote.   won’t say anything agree. lol I've seen considered new virus....

So numbers drop time across many different areas? Around January 12, many different countries saw massive decline cases.

Now, almost cue, seeing increase cases. Us overall rolling vaccines second fastest large countries whole world. Even worst states Us done double amount jabs EU nations. Vaccines going extremely well  modeled trajectory variant U.S. exhibits rapid growth early 2021, becoming predominant variant March. found fraction B.1.1.7 among SGTF samples varied state, detection variant increased logistic rate similar observed elsewhere, doubling rate little week increased transmission rate 35-45%. especially bad weather days. would called hyperbole months ago, I'm beginning agree you. I've drawn personal line sand restrictions longer teneble... We're yet, important line know take stand.   friend cardiologist working vulnerable patient populations got sick flight west cost last February.  flu symptoms tested negative flu. 

They could even spare test early march. One local gyms kicked member urging members please wear masks. gym owner staff asking members wear masks wear masks properly, member asking them, nicely, please wear masks. 

When gym owner questioned local television station enforcing guidelines herself, replied that, ""People fainting ellipticals"".

That statement even make sense. I'm fairly certain gym owner either believe mask wearing content allow non-maskers run roughshod common sense. I'm aware gamble, lol. I've pushed travel twice now. felt optimistic travel opening end summer/fall. push again, will, traveling internationally soon can.  Like traitor cause justice believe good things possible likely coming soon.

I think deep misunderstanding, see happen sub every day. People talking past think arguing almost never are. really pisses even necessarily messaging poor, vaccines END POINT. everyone vaccinated, that's it, over. course virus still around, literally can't get closer eradication vaccine, point, becomes: wait mass vaccinations, cases likely resemble flu wait 10+ years virus officially eradicated. physical contact. Restaurants 25% capacity forever. bars. concerts. Masks (this one mind much, require 10 years would beyond crazy).

I care deadly virus is, I'm locking even another year. mental toll taken way worse anything virus I'm vaccinated. school British Columbia, Canada teacher left windows open better ventilation school board forcefully shut nailed stapled shut safety hazard opening closing them.. 
 link posted shows B117 variant growing quickly, falling. shows proportion Covid tests SGTF (S gene target failure reliably occurs B117 present rarely occurs present) quickly growing 1% early January 15% now. also shows percentage tests SGTF found contain B117 sequencing grown 90% now.

That said think cause much alarm. UK proves possible bring Covid control even B117 dominant know vaccines effective it. overall Covid cases dropping quickly vaccine rollout I'm skeptical idea going see big spike cases B117 even would happen many people risk serious illness vaccinated. They’re arguably worse. COVID die become endemic disease one day (within months US, least). Though, fanaticism surrounding (very naive) idea ever contracting dying COVID ever arguably much dangerous harmful long term. One cruise lines requiring vaccine US-only riverboat operator... one positively shocked me. Especially given ship docks (think river party cities). typically lot children passengers anyway, would nothing carve exception kids. like people understand virus so-called bubbles reflect virus community, vaccine requirement not-withstanding. give people tools protect themselves. RN-BSN, ""fly-by"" insulting BS ever encountered. stepped ICU back, due overworked, overwhelmed, understaffed underpaid. hell. mean, know patients die daily. 10-12 day much. take breaks needed hands deck. traumatic. nursing field close 20 years, NEVER experienced anything like Covid before. worked H1N1, nowhere near bad. enough PPE, co-workers died, administration help, send us fucking planes? surreal moment. hell us going gain jets applause? mention Covid staff even step outside see said fuckery. drowning, federal government care. vaccination happening, along herd immunity, Los Angeles county mend. But, always look back dark days anger sadness. taken pandemic seriously, thank you. still think hoax, ass. Err, there's nothing indicates that's trending downward Brazil, activate 7 day moving average cases deaths graphics going up. spin facts, ridiculous Masks make cardio hard, mean allowed take cardio anyway.

Unfortunately can't cardio mask on, all. warmer run outside, people can't go outdoors need either find safe alternative give cardio time threat virus eliminated mean get 90%+ positivity rates - know number shit.

You using tests confirm severe severe cases. Yeah everybody job that’s critical functioning society. still count real concerns. Another thing that’s lost this... Travel restrictions May 17th. I'm going late July. family Scotland vaccines then. Except modern hvac designed run without windows open think, screws Let guess, even virus killing 20% people you’d saying ‘it’s half bad Black Death. fuss’. You’ve yet actually provide legitimate sources claims. 

Our partnership CanSino didn’t impact vaccine procurement. one first countries sign deals Pfizer Moderna. Oh polio reference? past years sea bad stuff happening much turned around since started

I'll search it, pretty in-depth study (or maybe better described attempt answer question year best) released early 2020 2019 was, aggregate, best year every live Earth human. Or, Wisconsinite, “da Pihg” Let's it! ❤️️ hope anti vaxxers change tune this. proof real time vaccines work.   Personally disagree. advantage I'm US, rapidly vaccinating population, received vaccine summer. think borders open people prove vaccinated. not, testing shorter quarantines. comparison pointless - want compare like like based age? Well, might well include factors result disproportional loss, like comorbidities race.

Well actually, yes. point make sense directly compare total lives lost driving vs COVID - much going that's without getting fact one hand taking personal risk, jeopardizing others. stats exclude deaths drunk driving, fraction 38k mentioned. think open season drunk driving personal decision?

I'm genuinely little lost point trying make. driving engaging society COVID wanes entail risks personal risks well potential impact others. Obviously one rationally arguing drunk diving, driving restrictions/safety measures matter. manner, restrictions still followed gradually lessened vaccination roll-out analysis emphasis indifference human life, since impact others you. Fantastic.

Nope, all. I'm 100% careless, free-for-all reopening without considering science behind things. there's strong reason believe we're quickly approaching point reasonably safe others begin resuming certain activities, especially present minimal transmission risk. still level risk persists quite time, mean shut society perpetuity - point becoming question trade-offs. It’s amazing election do.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  Right. vaccines amazingly effective. risk remains, simply risk human. we’ve always risks always made choices, everyone offered vaccine need completely normal (at least govt regulation perspective, people want alter behavior personally call). people still die Covid part risk alive, deaths natural causes like 2.8m people die every year US  TBF significantly lacked testing capabilities last spring took early summer get enough COVID-19 tests  civil lol ill leave photo american vaccination card. 4 rows.  long majority public accept it, it’ll never happen. read earlier Switzerland’s government forced reopen shops limited capacity exit lockdown unpopular restrictions were. 'Science' infallible monolith. Break glass It’s dropping bit. Exactly. appears everyone accountable personally feel safe there. couple days holidays little crowded liking left.  Sure pal. gym outdoors everyone wearing masks, fine. Unfortunately many gyms outdoors low mask wearing. gym owners care even support wearing mask. I’ll corned beef, potatoes, another Guinness.  wasn’t context. context clearly vaccinated around vaccinated.  whole host people literally haven’t seen parents year finally think can....nope. Danger!
That’s context scared it, stay Fuck home. Don’t like it, don’t go there. It’s pretty simple. plummeting trending downward. science finished? That’s unbelievable thing say. Curevacs CEO said vaccine likely effective mutations, thinks it’ll get approved June Today Hessen Germany everyone about. currently downtown see parks full people. People waking around eating ice cream chilling side talking. wear masks, many don't, thing feels different shops closed bars empty.


At time, right now, Italy Lombardia schools closed, people home, streets empty.

We living different time lines one knows wtf going on, cdc, politicians, everyone theories life go back normal. [results phase 3 showed efficacy 86.4% group aged 65+. means room 20 adults 65 older statistically possible 3 full response COVID vaccine.

If also vaccinated chances getting COVID small. vaccinated COVID risk spreading 3, high risk group simply b/c age. However, vaccines shown prevent serious COVID death (nearly all?) cases...

Draw conclusions. I'm taking risk around parents aunts/uncles (who 70+) I, myself, vaccinated too. data UK proves effective safe amongst age groups really absolutely reason limit 65s. think US we're going see real vaccination requirements absent leaving country. aware equipment gym treadmill? Plus, treadmill quite bad knees joints terms biomechanics. 

A power rack plus dumbbells would run upwards several thousand. Add rower/stationary bike already $5k. gym $50/month, that's equivalent nearly 10 years gym memberships.   Good luck VACCINE KIDS! start putting location/country title threads? sounds like talking worldwide cases actually US. say no? close eyes pretend it’s happening. Avoiding tourists fond memory days living Conch country. True, Europe currently woefully vaccination, indication yet mutation resistant. EEEK mutation lend antibody escape. Brazil plummeting cases, opposite what's really happening here. warmer temperatures year long Brazil, drove away virus mutate middle Amazon rainforest (Manaus).  Well, Fauci muzzled months, Biden president little one month. plan place get many vaccines arms people possible, there's evidence R0 dropped 1, worry sharing reopening plans.

[At least Biden administration plan likely developed bragging like previous administration would Stop Nice! ended buying bunch resistance bands, dipping bars indoor cycling bike streaming subscription Peloton. Space limited go things take much space.  Thank you. seriousness 150 million much closer experts estimates 5x, I’ve seen 10-15x estimates elsewhere Seriously. minor symptoms (headache fever 99.2) without travel confirmed contact. I’m 36. able walk yesterday get rapid test results 30 minutes day. Came positive. Doubt would able get tested last year. cases decrease. things start open up. Oh lookie loos, new variant. Cases rising! Better shut again. Cases decreased! Time allow things start open again. Oh noes! Scientists found “worrying” new variant. Cases upticked! Lockdown 17.0. Cases down. Restrictions rolling back. new variant....

Repeat ad nauseum. New Normal. Sad is. Enjoying live entertainment replaced sitting watching netflix/streaming services.

20 years least we'll able look back youtube videos live shows show children like.  actual data that, assume case resistance granted appears scale better higher severity. Nonetheless stop media presenting fact. people literal babies. ran miles mask summer, it’s literally bad  know read article, actually explaining reinfection mean doom. agree partially, can't wear mask work out, stay gym. wear mask, use go gym.

But 'working mask impossible' kind rhetoric used people take masks even goes regulations common sense, patience deal shit year. Well said. think many irresponsible, selfish people underground parties flaunting rules, rest us feel bad going 100% opposite direction.

But also yeah, news sources piled onto bad news potentially bad news made *we're literally cautioned switch news time time mental health*.

It's obscene. big fan mainstream news channels before, based problems political bias etc., I'm even cynical crisis. new California New York variants? Basically every time I’ve told place safe fact fucking safe. Whether that’s business, event, family / friend gathering. Feels like year gaslighting man I’ve said day one “they” never say, “it’s over! Go back life normal.” end gradually, one one, people decide risk low enough they’ve enough, start disobeying guidelines. Eventually enough people guidelines become completely irrelevant. one day five years now, presidential proclamation pandemic over, one care distant memory then. number mutations maintain high contagiousness also escaping immune response suspected quite small. case like influenza antigenic drift happens because. read.

The next step probably pan-coronavirus vaccine drops spike protein presents bunch receptor binding domains - part spike binds cells get absorbed. could vaccination SARS, MERS, SARS-2, SARS-2b, hCoV single shot. country run defeatists.  yesterday reached 250,000 deaths. Ah. type propaganda? wonder things help hinder. Personally, everyone know see sort thing, making distrustful sources write them, meaning good information sources ignored because, well, they’re already proven propagandists. 

Perhaps would better news agencies things. data showing Florida outbreaks places open schools? You’re you’re analysis backwards. start hospitalisations deduct risk factors. trying start risk factors calculate hospitalisation would I’m dying go back personally. winter it’s working house running cold often dark due working hours. Absolutely miserable, don’t even 1/3 equipment used use. I’ve gained weight lost considerable progress worked hard for. 

I haven’t gone back, understand people talking lmao..

In March 0.0% population exposed Covid. We’re easily past 50% combining Vaccinations+past infected. We’ll 50% vaccinated alone 6 weeks. 

How opinion worse now...? agreement regarding government, sure. I’m sure Germany totally unable use doses many countries EU happy accepting doses. Two coworkers Netherlands got vaccinated AZ week (due age 60+) said GP fully booked line get vaccine. new variants New York California? evolve beyond reach vaccines point? think issue wanting reduce deaths etc, want making decision easy one make. annoyance comes saying achieve home, completely wrong complete disregard others physical mental health Personally I’m breath set squats wearing mask makes even harder get set

Then stay fucking gym pandemic. Love maths Barely anyone getting tested them. wouldnt prison workouts routines everyone full gyms hospital numbers. Every vaccine basically crushes those. going devastate humanity. going away time soon Yes no. Novelness huge factor pandemic potential. zoonotic diseases pandemic potential. flu quite high given general communicability, I'm convinced risk several zoonotic diseases, including coronavirus varients. fact many flu variants circulating decreases chances completely new variant even partial immunity (but eliminate it). increase human nature edge interactions increasing probability introduction novel zoonotic pathogens, discount that. 

That said, reduce risk pandemic diseases preparadeness, prevention, mitigation strategies. Hopefully apply lessons learned pandemic better so. Start playing golf again?

Wasn't like mid May 2020? B.1.429 lineage entirely different base mutation (L452R) actually know anything. since quite prevalent places successful vaccination efforts (same N501Y B.1.1.7 lineage) good bet substantially worsen vaccinations. young think they’re invincible. know lmao Healthline rigorous health journalism source, pop journalism. owned company owns tvguide media critic. aware ads facts. wear mask screened exercise class. think main problem restrictions summer understanding may come back winter.

There still far many restrictions last summer people got increasingly tired it. 

I'm sorry expecting people go year without normal unmasked social interactions recipe non-compliance time. shame people want true problem absolute piss poor planning Government top bottom. get recurrent FB ad Flanet Pitness town two maskless ppl jogging treadmill, labeled “cardio distancing!” hell honestly surprised ? I've dragged last year much worse number hovering around 35.

We threshold well, funny situation. Obviously, want continue weight loss right moment, could also result several extra months waiting turn. 

What silly decision make. highly believe Covid-19 aerosolized based experience.

SARS-CoV-2 ability aerosolized fact known months irony restrictions brought flu cases nearly standstill winter. Turns flu considerably harder spread COVID, thanks vaccines masks.  Fucking duh plan, it’s vaccinate many people fast possible try best get hands vulnerable. Compared CA zero plans whatsoever, recently resulted millions vials sitting freezer Bingo. idea *only* 29 million Americans contracted highly contagious, often asymptomatic/ low-symptomatic virus laughable. 

Anecdotal younger brother lives college apartment 14 young guys. 14 sick around time ~May. 

Two got tested came back positive Covid, 12 go get tested - pain ass plus would they? knew Covid. 

Multiply story happening 10Million times get much closer true number covid patients “30 million” Jesus Christ. “One dude amazing cardio endurance it, you!” everyone amazing lung capacity ability regulate breathing efficiently enough manage this. Personally I’m breath set squats wearing mask makes even harder get set would like wear mask I'd ask him. service picking car, I'd ask (politely) wear mask, would make comfortable. Oh wow. like living country leadership gives shit people make smart responsible decisions? could also low transmission thus far. So, Finland currently 133 deaths per 1 million covid. comparison, US 1600 so. So, using metric actual spread, means US 12 times immunity Finland. estimated US 1/4 1/3 population who've it, factor vaccinations, could excess 40 percent population immunity, really helps suppress R value. Finland, less 10%, help R value nearly much. think large number people can't admit recovery going takes years means lockdowns serious negative consequences. easy say ""stay home, save lives"" receiving paycheck WFH job. reality people can't stay home. we're going see reality first industry shutdown last reopen.

I'm NYC, know Chicago theater groups, symphonies, dance troupes, etc. already cancelled summer. one knows restrictions lifted, things take time people plan currently money coming in. 

Registration marathon usually opens October following year's race October. happened yet. hope happens, let anyone register *and October 2021.*

There confirmed music festivals. street festivals. Nothing. Normally people apply permits 6+ months out. late September events still tentatively scheduled, one sold tickets anything yet. 

Entire industries dead water right now. made decision this, need live it.  problem basing reopening guidelines observational data. 

“We haven’t traced much transmission gyms, could safely reopen them.” Buddy, that’s cause gyms closed severely limited capacity Plus venues barely squeaked best times. Operating business NYC unbelievably expensive. real estate sit get yoinked big investment company chain pay it. evidence really ""evidence?"" seems far convenient every time things start getting better, got vaccines going cases plummeting, ""new study"" comes along tells us we're still doomed need keep locked anyway.

""The science evolving quickly!"" comes retort. certainly understand that. can't ignore reality ""new studies"" keep coming time dampen people's enthusiasm throw wrench reopening. Sorry hear :( Whatever may wrong UK, nothing touch incompetence failure European Commission. Nothing comes close. Agreed.

I would also like see data people routine socially distance others.

I’ve going gym since June socially distance others. It’s bad thing do. still haven’t caught COVID. girlfriend it, quarantined still didn’t get it. wonder story written. 

Why person get news story millions others don’t? wonder chose write it. Ok, kind understand point. I'm also one people think could gotten better control earlier on, know. really hope date become much sooner approved vaccines countries vaccinating quickly finish supply opened measure surface area? :) sounds promising, I’m going roll dice though it’s confirmed safe do. allowed members wear masks working wild me.

During intensive workout volume passing respiratory system 10+ higher. Masks designed handle this. got first dose week ago pick someone local airport Saturday. person I'm picking first dose month ago. I'm going wear mask car know won't. I'm kinda nervous. overreacting? Ever get people tell pushups, bodyweight squats go runs outside? Yeah fuck people.  I'm also high school teacher Germany, I'll get first shot next week. lot colleagues get next week well. Feels like they're trying put negative headlines last days may.  still hearing people say *If people followed restrictions would last summer?* variation that.

Do people understand pandemic works? literally one way herd immunity natural infection vaccination.

If worst case happened vaccines, everyone would *need* catch virus pandemic actually end would mean letting spread population.

Experts beginning said 60-70% world population contract COVID need extend longer period time overwhelm medical infrastructure.

When idea come lockdown restrict way this? never actually cards. People point NZ Australia objectively wrong well vaccine's happen, would also let infection rip through.

Thank god vaccines. vaccine. I'm firefighter/paramedic transport patients nursing homes ER multiple times every shift. nursing home patient last month least first vaccine shot 
The wearing masks working exerting need oxygen. feel like I’d pass working wear mask. Focusing breathing efficiently hard enough without piece fabric stuck mouth Give evidence believe. live state admitted hold back 30% doses. live state there’s even one vaccine provider website, 700 individual providers websites check availability one individually. live country leaders promised would mobilize military use defense production act get vaccines people quickly haven’t done it. live country without singular national strategy followed state.

So it’s really good thing we’re ramping vaccine production delivery, yet see evidence quickly efficiently, I’m tired told wait “just little longer” good things happen. It’s easier believe they’ll get fucked somehow. Honestly coronavirus best time gym, barely anyone there.

Also people saying closed, please realize gyms LA Fitness Planet Fitness. local gym owned husband wife talk daily. forced close months would sell gym. barely holding due decreased memberships. Trust me, people love hear seriously ‘good team’ taking virus, even solid year, never gets old. 

We’re reaching moment shit isn’t going fly anymore, we’re returning normal life whether everyone wants not. need path normalcy... now. three mini-outbreaks job (nobody seriously affected thank god) every time first person infected got gym. Could give example this? Preferably German government, tabloid press course print whatever gives readers regardless effects public views. Yeah doctors making $250K+ per year pretty quickly. Student loans issue, outside might hold new BMW year pay off. ""Aren't likely"" like ""can't."" Unless thousands dollars invest quality equipment, space house put it, everything half-measure.

Sucks poor apartment dwellers people live crowded conditions, without access safe parks outdoor spaces, hey, fuck 'em, right? Gotta save grandmas. gym recently started going taking pretty intense precautions. Dividers every machine, masks enforced roaming staff, everyone issued bottle spray sanitizer use before/after using equipment.

I feel safer walking around grocery store. bros gross hygiene pandemic, that's surprise. I’m Facebook group trial participants. people confirmed given real vaccine low levels antibodies. got mRNA vaccine antibodies popping. we’ll wait see. Lest assemble celebrate big hall! Hand sanitizer cheap gave people warm fuzzy feeling taking seriously. Ventilation expensive offices schools actually improve it.  felt beginning strong man, go away rhetoric lying bed 2.5 months die. lot disbelief propagated leadership telling us big deal. 

I haven’t seen articles can’t comment think it’s bit complicated supposed cancel culture. 

I think beginning people shaming others weren’t following rules. remember walking around nyc may everything ravaged seeing groups 15-20 people socializing feeling frustrated I’d lost big chunk life. 

I wish culture you’re describing would end now, I’m certainly shame anyone, hope could encourage people patient deal endlessly complex, exhausting situation. risk yes, done better CA, TX, NY sadly  “Dear Brits, envy you.”

Kind contradictory consider people UK receiving AstraZeneca vaccine I've wondering CDC arriving particular conclusion.

Options:

1. Infected patients getting tested, virus genomes analyzed, patterns travel overlap specific genome patterns identified
1. Nonstandard questionnaires completed, responses analyzed, trying identify patterns; ""I still go gym"" called insignificant data point 
1. Conjecture, based social activities grocery shopping, church gatherings, parties, restaurants/bars, etc
1. Something else

I'd love believe first option. realist thinks otherwise. 

I say someone stopped going gym year ago.  increase cases speak of? world leader indicated we'd still heavy restrictions full vaccination? 

Nope, another strawman. certain crowd trying stoke fears authoritarian takeover via pandemic restrictions keep spreading misinformation goalposts continue move forever. UK export ban. think misunderstand. accept ""endgame"" basically living new endemic lives.

There many people yet accepted COVID stay. Generally speaking, much discussion acceptance that. additional risk unacceptable, massive sacrifices necessary somehow eliminate risk, completely absurd. Yes, really would great people critical thinking skills. also seems magnified online people read/write headlines versus anything substance. ambiguity/nuance automatically tilted whatever want believe. There’s significant protection first shot teacher that's subject/class around 7 years straight, tell around 70%. know content pace. know evaluate kids. know they're learning pace learning.

&amp;nbsp;

Very ignorant say they're learning 0 25%. Sounds like fucking holiday compared we've enduring Ireland last 9 months... IIf younger adults tend experiense intense symptoms second dose, interpreted older adults tend experiense less intense symptoms second dose. older adult, expected experience intense symptoms second dose based emphirical experience doctors far. Thats doctor Germany said, one gave vaccine confirmed, general observtion. harsh reaction, also said experience far, every patient different. happened almost month ago, since revaccination follow anything changed.  didn’t give any. classrooms. don’t get it. decline due vaccine natural herd immunity seasonality. 

This whole realization epidemic control makes people nervous. following recommend federal guidelines? IIRC, states moved CV19 patients nursing homes attempt open hospital beds. That's untrue: mid Feb, split even. overwhelming Pfizer vaccine. outside really seem even minor point transmission. Keeping people going outside forcing mask wearing everywhere outside never made sense. grocery store? Maybe bar month. haven’t gone outside year? don’t plan to? satire?  Dude, sort education think nurses get? already get training vaccines, may looking experimental vaccine using technology never marketed public deciding maybe would rather receive time. Also half probably already got COVID, getting vaccinated big priority them.  know lots people waiting official approval EUA, guess we'll need wait years it’s contact entitles many days workload doesn’t really allow it. leaves, returns 2-3x work got done building school. reasons mostly emergency/active shooter situations.

&amp;#x200B;

Replying rest thread - schools full force session entire school year exception slow start. near zero transmission. still elementary school zero student cases. 2500ish student enrollment. 

Our adaptations COVID-19 would use Clorox Total 360 machines twice week classroom, strict masking policies well frequent handwashing. 

&amp;#x200B;

It done!  think vaccinated people may still want get test visit someone extremely high risk immunocomprimised example. 

No symptoms always mean virus. headlines suck. study, per article, talking symptoms disease. fantastic vaccine works well prevent people getting ill...the problem headline make part clear. says ""effective"", leaving people confused make assumptions means. mean prevents 94% transmission virus? Nope, people think that. 

We crisis scientific illiteracy communication. like comment 🙃 make point school old be. idea ventilation system ridiculous. 20 degree weather would prevents opening windows. Yea dope man /s wasn’t. CEO AZ confirmed this. rEaLiStIc Biden Fauci really create closing plans, though. state close (or not), open. Trump office, golden goose getting clicks NeW vArIaNt you, happy at-home life change anyone else tells to. 

Personally I'm getting haircut going eat wife get second pfizer shot couple weeks (I'll wait one week second dose). I'm gonna start seeing friends family comfortable it. excited long time news, water wet. people understand pandemic works? literally one way herd immunity natural infection vaccination.

Perhaps academic point, particular point true. lot epidemics get contained figure ways reduce spread rather reaching herd immunity. Hemorrhagic fever epidemics contained contact tracing, quarantine, increased use PPE, public education campaigns avoid contracting/spreading them. Cholera epidemics contained treating drinking water educating people avoid contamination drinking water. COVID super hard costly contain spreads super easily well asymptomatically/presymptomatically containment measures huge economic emotional physical health burden, also nearly deadly hemorrhagic fevers, course tradeoff people willing subject long term extreme measures required contain - frankly unobjectionable me. COVID like 20% fatality rate instead less 1%, bet ass would willing take extreme measures months years however long takes contain instead waiting reach herd immunity killing tens millions people process.

That said, silly imagine would taken months mask wearing whatever summer would done COVID forever. would taken extreme costly measures probably would included form ongoing management years end. would sucked, lot.  'Good news, soon able go back wage slaves outside.' ... mutations help evade body's natural immune response -- well effects monoclonal antibody treatments

Hope just-approved J&amp;J single dose handle that. disagree, give factual answers expect adults able process nuance ambiguity.

I expect pilot say ""it impossible plane crash"", expect say ""it many times likely get automobile accident plane accident, even equip plane evacuation slides liferafts, safe flying us"". Might wanna check wording there, buddy. I'm shaking bro, got NOOOOO! VACCINES NOTHING, LOCKED FOREVERINOOOO!  find please link! crab person, confirm related 5G folks, although share office space break room 13th floor ConspiracyCo. Corporate Tower Source Michigan plant suppose supply Canada? I've read initial 100 million US shipment, Canada may receive it. think option US extend 200 million. sam hell reasoning? What? No, resources actively test. 20 us concert hall fit 400. stand 8-10 feet apart. They’re called resonance masks. soon weather improves going back rehearsing outside would asbestos prevent opening windows? 1918: lets prepare future pandemic never happens again

2020: CDC says 6 feet apart completely immune stand 7 feet apart willing ""decrease social interactions"" rest life? guy vaccines! Ffs stupid troll, never hoped get sick, do. go grocery store Doritos? might killed someone's grandma! obesity real problem here, masked socially distanced workout. want say appreciate putting view there. matter agree disagree. matters made falsifiable statement, means end point disagreement proven right wrong. wrong, obviously viewpoint get less say going forward. Yeah, I’d say months go restrictions won’t make common sense. (or when) time comes, it’s time make voices heard. angry, snappy attitude get constantly working every day letting house work chores stress pile goes quite bit 3 day weekend.

It still help. Hopefully communities get left behind. that's also untrue LEED ton issues always encourage what's best environment. variants spreading everywhere months yet almost every place Earth seen virus retreat. Many places moving away restrictions months again....variant still fading.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* literally seen people posting ""if everyone would wear mask/ wear two masks, would sooner!"" 

I genuinely understand people think wearing mask would magically eradicate covid faster? Public health messaging made people believe spread covid 100% due ""selfish"" humans following rules would somehow end pandemic... text saved time wife’s work number told building shut down. scary. true. friend got first job boot camp Utah $95k mid tier engineer. pizza cook / ski bum. sounds like conversation boss she’s taken vacation days didn’t take vacation vacation day (which read post) Yes! I’m still high school, think everyone understand I’m trying say. 

As current sophomore, keep told “shut up, least get prom. least get senior year.” Yes, that’s true, everyone “at least.” least seniors chance make friends. It’s hard half freshman year make friends. 

Everyone says worse, can’t say “this really sucks everyone”. sucks little kids missing Halloween sucks seniors can’t communicate friends bad technology. sucks sports music fans. EVERYONE struggling yall expect vaccine release everything normal right away? 

Yes, read fabricated outrage, exactly people expected. skeptic, reverse pessimism (since word get banned lol) doesn’t really help all. adds unnecessary negativity otherwise comforting, uplifting discussion. Wow school one story. thought would nine story building risk falling, nope. Agreed, literally title article advocates stricter precautions. Iowa mask mandates time. wild fucking west there. family came over, Louisiana, MO, Chicago, NC Iowa. Many nurses working COvid people negative. That's exactly said too, fucking way, much risk I'm everyone else followed suit too. like week left put mask mandate in. maybe expected given Southern Hemisphere saw thing summer.

[Covid-19 Measures Wiped Flu Southern see vaccines soon officially approved EUA? think anti vax people MIGHT change mind happens, then... actually happens I’ll legit move Florida point lol GTFO there. Sounds like work toxic facility.   You’re 2 different forums talking right now.

What’s goal here? want Reddit stop America-Europe-Centric?

1st world, happens term “not communist countries”, bar Americans Europeans set treat other.

That countries don’t treat people well isn’t point. democracies, expect treated well, expect that, power change that’s strong democracies tend work. Anything less power ruling class wanes. That’s literally main side effect strong, stable democracy, stops happening, it’s gradually becoming weaker non democracy.

We choose measuring stick whole world, world people treated way accept treated. Nope, sensationally negative headline generates clicks people love anti-social nature “quarantines” mask mandates.

Stop thinking worst everyone else consider may reasons opinions. number 1 problem world today outside climate change.

Here, watch, easy: good person, way reaching conclusions reasonable given information values hold, makes sense people disagree conclusions. Yeah, year this, either start giving people something realistically work caution thrown window. Saying two vaccinated people can’t hug, whether jury officially still not, end relatively reasonable people throwing precautions window entirely. bother wearing mask distancing can’t even return relative normality vaccination?

And say U.K. based teacher who’s going waiting many months vaccine going thrown class 30 kids little week. I've saying months run schools summer safer break around winter virus dangerous. also bc many tourists catch covid Florida test positive back home state. 

That still doesn’t add Florida open yet cases. Sure theory could correct small degree, tourists catching like wildfire aren’t residents Florida? There’s 20 million people live Florida, it’s like we’re talking North Dakota -there plenty idea domestic restrictions quickly dismissed many reasons.

Like blatantly unconstitutional? live Key West, we're overrun tourists

Headed next month vacation actually, pretty excited understanding Pfizer vaccines Canada always planned made facility Belgium. still weak evidence unconfirmed. Obviously needs investigated further, hardly confirms statement "" virus travels air corridors rooms, ventilation system neighboring rooms."" certainly aren’t going fight mandates. think find 5 years like 25-50% public either got it, type immunity (Tcell, random blood type). 

If look data worldometers, West (European countries, US States) 800-2000 deaths per million bucket major outliers. worst hit areas world around 2700, big deviation. March epidemiologists NYT advocating take windows modify windows public transit. know one listened. Honestly pink eye could coincidental everything else textbook anxiety. Haha real please link That’s exactly H1N1. Sure, everyone wants vaccine given one, done. happen year US Professionals speak absolutes things absolute. never hear medical professional lawyer say ""definitely"".


The problem public messaging, people (many sub, much fewer IRL) can't process ambiguity. need absolutes given (like Trump speaks) otherwise makes nervous. ambiguity need process information multiple sources come determination themselves. someone gives absolutes removes burden thought sense responsibility. Spring? Hell Key West lodging near 100%, streets, bars restaurants jammed. regular high season here, slightest restrictions couple businesses trying responsible, that's it. we'll likely get booster shot every year like flu Jerusalem Post guy Jerusalem. 

We many deaths US last two days entire pandemic Israel, stuff like gets magnified there. It’s great conspiracy. headline weird. CDC already encourages improved ventilation. first line article little better, says ought provide guidance. already provide guidance here: see multiple aerosol scientists complaining social media CDC's main school guidance page (possibly adequately address ventilation, true first link much thorough second.  that. unless bench can’t must chest workouts. 

If want hit Lats need rowing machine. lol? You’re right. downvoters wrong god, sad getting downvotes this. literally kind person trying get parents vaccinated talking cautions taking cautions impacted life. even know people trying prove here--that cautious like restrictions? Sorry, best luck family. science bashing....sigh don’t make decisions based anecdotes. It’s elderly immunocompromised, people certain specific conditions. we’re shutting prevent flu. Get vulnerable vaxxed THATS hygiene theater 

Have seen Target ad employee mopping concrete outside store? long still wear masks work getting risky... least til studies make things clear.

As Canadian, attitude doesn’t make prospective border opening feel great, either... hopefully know border opens back up. you’re likely vaccinated long are. friends Amsterdam still go small apartment parties, accidentally stay pass curfew got party 4:30 morning go back home 😬  Agreed, number quite small. I'm schools opening safely. kids getting covid dying (at least point view anyway), since that's obviously lot lower risk older people. kids transmitting covid vulnerable people. Teachers generally old enough zero risk either. 

I'd favor reopening safely. There's reason can't distance learning (most college done way), limited person attendance least vulnerable classes must done person.

I replied person claim nobody certain age died, that's easily demonstrably false, also point closing schools point. expected decrease social interactions prioritize hygiene. fact also decreased excess mortality another reason Covid deniers believe crab people want harvest eyes. administer construction maintenance education. I've installing/retrofitting HVAC systems operable windows 20 years, I've fight budget finance boss every project, ESPECIALLY respect providing operable windows classrooms. 

Now huge relief we've done work (and I'm still waiting acknowledgment lol). Good! Sounds like got leg stand on. bristle little people complain journalists sucking absolutely nothing fund journalism. get kind vicious cycle, though - hard justify paying product sucks, hard produce good product little pay. good friend dual US/UK passports flew UK Tuesday care mother. saying UK they're telling people make summer domestic travel plans, within UK. 

Europe's summer last year completely horrendous, opened pretty widely Americans hurt.

I wrong brushing international travel brush, Mexico busy visitors South America light restrictions. Asia, Australia Europe unlikely widely open 2021. I’ve seen companies getting employees cheaper areas using pay differential pay less based location within US. course outsourcing another country always option, too. surprised follow minor body builder weight lifter see gyms never ever really shut covered windows said spot on.

Here Costa Rica, public authorities desisted actually testing people household.

If someone turned positive, health ministry assumed everyone else house also got it. pessimistic approach sure, slight differentiation actual tested cases called ""cases nexus"", end useful close reality. Anyone thinks zoom music hilariously naive concept latency. Seeing people wear masks gym makes neurotic wiping equipment. fact ppl using shit leaving makes worse. ""Safest place open"" yeah fuckin right.

Went cancel membership October-November. asked why, counted 7 people breaking mask rule one one front her. 12 people including us middle day.

I feel people working grocery stores, gyms, retail etc. enjoy instruct issue compliance grown-ass tax-paying adults something simple everybody's best interest. would tolerate bullshit even second. Unless get tested every week know not, 50% people asymptomatic. 

And BTW know healthy 35 year old dropped dead heart attack asymptomatic covid. (They able see ""covid lung"" signs post covid syndrome autopsy)

Gyms terrible idea right now. Even precautions. wearing become norm someone cold symptoms.

It doubt will. think idea masks ""over"" ingrained end virus people even think use common colds. don’t think understand math statistics work going gyms pandemic. year order workout gear house. would saved money lives now. think it’s going get somewhat closer Asia parts US while. think North East especially see much larger voluntary mask wearing better part decade. Fine me, especially given concurrently flu vaccine. can't, oh well. 

Obviously I'd love necessary, virus persists science vaccines shows drastic decline protection certain point, issue booster. Yep. would surprised causes real estate bubble city finally pop. happens, *much* money lost. found rapid test negative. Thanks. open places AFAIK. I'm asking question people say closed. ...it add up. ones saying people conditions definitely hospitalized, happens much higher rate. also take consideration fact high number patients hypertension, obesity diabetes combination 3. mean, like third country working home, probably nearly half avoiding family gatherings last year.

Even regardless masks human beings I’m ever near group coworkers every day. wasn’t social butterfly still used like... go places work. Didn’t you? Hickox v Christie useful case too. You’re crazy I’ve worried exact thing happening. source elderly people severe first dose little reaction second? havent read that. think spring reasonable domestic travel US tbh. International, I’m assuming late year, maybe next, least Western Europe. Fiancée wanted trip Italy planning years, assuming won’t happen 2022 best. preparing hospitals 50% capacity weeks, government preparing restrictions case happens. 

I think serious lockdown happening overall infection rate up. Lots infections happening restaurants, serious lockdown justify shutting down. No, know. messaging come top change point. Otherwise Twitter mob continue running show we’ll vaccinated sheltering place next 15 years.  mean gyms open places except maybe Ca. places gyms even closed. They’ve open NJ we’ve pretty strict restriction wise  one contact tracing efforts leads back gyms, Redditors target gyms use them.

What load bullshit. Unlike you, 'mental tough guy', missed gym enough find ways work despite weather extremes. take bullshit strawman sell elsewhere.

The defense gyms contact tracing - indicated useless. everything open, Americans take seriously little value. That's contact tracing also suggested indoor dining safe despite fact multiple epidemiological studies strongly suggested otherwise.

It's possible miss gym pretend safe, indoor dining, bars schools. working trainer weeks would tell it’s ok pull mask cardio. like I’m get fucking covid bru. Anyway stopped working dude. several months ago vaccines approved, pfizer / moderna released efficacy data people starting talk distribution, someone (who claimed connected public health planning, idea legit take grain salt) mentioned J&amp;J would probably used rural / remote areas lesser storage requirements. think also makes sense reasons - less population dense areas slightly less efficacy probably even less important; and, people 'out sticks' might less hesitant take *seemingly* less 'new' technology (I realize pretty much perception) mRNA. Ha! police force? Unfortunately people want cover ears loudly sing “la la la PANDEMIC OVER!” 100% correct.  hope so, otherwise, yikes. changing policy based new research close year much ask? 

So changing policy based new research hundreds thousands people died result policies based shitty technically correct completely useless sometimes misleading statements much ask? dunno, tell me. Will, point soon ""there children vaccine, therefore can't go back normal. letting child near ANYONE children's vaccine 100% efficacy"" sentiment Twitter posts sub considered child abuse?

(I know I'm straw-manning, know mean) south, [cases longer merely Try getting decent meal school.......  problem USA windows design shut option open. cool air heat it. old office building busted AC need run time year round get 22C air. Welcome American efficiency.... what? don’t get it.  Yes, thank you, remember one. 

Then choirs States Germany. Also, seating studies aeroplanes trains, know one report Korean gym, one quiet course one shouting intense exercise, attended infected person. already bit weak shouting contaminates surfaces people front huge amounts large ballistic droplets. German Tönnies meat plant study, data aerosols favor, chose ignore data writing conclusion.

But examples decide whether aerosols 10% 95%. would pretty dumb focus governmental societal attention 10% route.

I really think government must compare 1000 well-ventilated room contact settings secondary attack rate 1000 badly ventilated ones. Hey, moral judgment people get social distancing, wanted make sure. would curb misinformation? timeline would set?  never ever understood don’t opening windows work places schools? swear air awful almost everyplace go nowadays Depends where—you air travel US countries Americas. wouldn’t shocked EU tried open travel summertime avoid another dead tourist season.  Go facebook search GA covid vax appt help (unofficial) many 500k 26 year olds?  remember last April-ish expert explaining described above; series openings closings various restrictions virus virus thing. Seems like pretty spot on. Fuck yeah. love porn! [NYT- COVID Emergency Must would lot okay this, even though see lot restrictions arbitrary useless, exit plan beginning least actual plan involving either realistically low metrics realistic dates. realistic mean fully attainable astronomically low, dates clear, concise, around UK’s dates (sooner might work, we’ll see. UK’s dates pretty conservative.)
I would also lot okay shaming culture wasn’t strong misinformation vaccines spread, asymptomatic transmission, PCR tests work, constitutes Covid death wasn’t rampant. Suite style apartment* it’s like 3 separate apartments share like large common area two separate kitchens/living areas, probably 4-5 bathrooms. 

It’s derelict living situation means. compared frat house lived it’s lavish mansion Let guess: ""healthy"" 400 pound individual Oh see, lies media, print fact checking it’s make believe? truth hurts sometimes.  gym open 24 hours codvid. could go 3 almost one else place. covid restricted hours 7am 10pm. safer. Sentences ""There evidence XX"" one sentences technically correct completely useless. mention preventative principle completely thrown window. Sure, technically evidence airborne transmission found, make sure, assume transmittable every possible way think of. funny exact opposite done. understand defending ""changing conclusions based new data"", statement correct mean didnt cause deaths multiple 100s thousands people misleading messaging. guy^ KNOWS porn March April last year? changing policy based new research close year much ask?

Edit typo. absolute number variant cases rising. 

I’ve seen people frame number variant cases relative number total cases giving skewed picture really happening. 

For arguments sake only, look variant totally new virus, exponential surge would concerning. Realistically concern falls somewhere middle variant doesn’t escape vaccination natural immunity, yet, current surge variant spite factors cause concern.  waited 2 weeks 2nd Moderna shot. think that’s reasonable amount time people wait resuming normalcy. honestly don’t see reason continue live bubble another six months. It’s detrimental life continue live way. Well distribution site doesn’t enough teachers coming get vaccinated, doses sitting there.

We tiered system state, can't fill appointments designated groups, adjust open appointments others. Doses need go waste. Yeah. feel like request ""more patience"" point, feels like demand endless patience. Well, 1 percent would 80 million. imagine lot people would find terrible calamity also imagine lot people think acceptable theory would cool applied unevenly. 7 8 million deaths came say UK US, suddenly, would okay. unequal death tolls mostly affected nations yeah, sure, let nature take course. real scary scenario scenario repeating every year. annual great thinning herd. Sounds like bad science fiction. impossible tell play out. may crossroads see variants emerge cannot engineer cures slowly contain multiple series annual vaccinations. Interesting times. Title include country/region... consume free media exactly get pay for. particularly care news right now, did, would absolutely pay instead relying garbage free news. Dripping virtue signaling here. people authority whole life people feed... don’t great answer you, always want ask people “And think ensure 330 million Americans (give take) follow rules?” 

If really want theory, think lot people want control think good behavior best way so, like add #stayhome filters Facebook everyone listen! mention media quick jump stories people “following rules” things like going beach big numbers summer graduation party. They’re good making people angry stories, leads public say “Why nobody LISTENING? need stay home!” 

I also think despite many people saying follow science think science real, don’t understand like claim. Viruses spread. Even hide home months open up. can’t outrun forever.  ""experts"" worried? time tell people flagged Harmful Dangerous Acts? scares though principle, vaccines developed (or vaccine-escape mutation takes over) we'd shut industries permanently, least country can't get zero.

Even pandemic ends year, make hopeful next pandemic, on-topic, would make think twice going industry depends non-distanced gatherings. we've established principle gatherings can't happen pandemic (and pretty much first pandemic tried), hard put back tube.   assertion ""more tests means cases recorded"" 100% false incorrect. simple statistics.

You 100% wrong. Simple statistics. positive tests virus testing make difference. get positive test need true false positive. one tested virus matter much testing done. 10% 0 0. 100% 0 0. 

OP used reverse correlation conclude lot positives tests lot testing. total liberal arts move. went say similar death rates probably similar positive cases, also something history teacher would say.  know get say. bugs me. mutual friends died covid idea ""taking seriously"" going restaurants travelling normal wearing mask do. completely different idea staying home. correct us electing government also joke electorate legitimately fearful mitigation efforts ""infinite years"". Ah Valneva, French vaccine funded Britain one found front queue arranged production facilities set up. vaccinations don’t give immunity new strains going circumvent vaccine deaths. Acting like keep charade another year silly. What, give us another $600 check staying home another year? schools central valley California even central HVAC system. government state federal level screwing us long finally exposed rest world. Live. talking about? everybody western world kill horrible things happening? 


This entire comment PANDEMIC, hopeful face it.  


You want pissed someone talking reasons optimistic face that? 

&amp;#x200B;

Get life.  


What planet? Bitching Reddit telling people depressed? spark real change. I'm worried covid coming end. worry restrictions masks stay available vaccine anyone wants one.

And one said something like, ""once 50% local state population vaccinated lift restrictions mask requirements"".

It's left open ended. area, restrictions crushing small business. 

I see harm setting goalpost. think would incentivize skeptics get vaccinated give small business better chance work lenders well. Keep going I'm nearly spanish flu ended two years pockets infection soldiers returned war. biggest deadliest wave ended spring 1919, live mostly normal. Heck, even parade în Brazil în spring 1919. 

And lockdowns social distancing, lockdown period cant compare one.... one lot tougher one back then... mean, US hardest lockdown, Kinda ended year after. pandemic 2 years, doesnt mean 2 years lockdown.And asume People werent fatigued time strictly following rules.Yeah, argue virus mutated less deadly strain, still.

And idk guys, couldnt leave home march parents downright scared fearmongering TV(they even healthy conditions pandemic, idk ,,stay home "" thing are). mean, guy said wear masks driving get COVID ventilation system car(not renounded expert, ,,local expert""). legs hurting like hell ,,entertainment"" things talking about. much? Heck, even long-Covid symptoms staying inside year. fucking depressed seeing People year. Nope, logistics. unprecedented amount demand right shortfall supply, namely drivers. good percentage truck schools closed, temporarily permanently. shortage goes back 2008 economy crashed stopped seeing companies paying put someone truck school. capacity never rebounded there, demand due online shopping recently COVID pandemic vaccine production skyrocketed higher. gotta say damn feels good read news everyday like this. Gets teary-eyed. long ass year “Death 43% time” incorrect. vaccines show protective effects keep almost everyone ventilator intervention death. holds true SA variant.  Oh yeah! I've already making plans travel see friends mine they're vaccinated (I'm already fully vaccinated myself). Many us can't stomach spending another summer cooped up. approved fda trust it, give money they'll approve anything wife got first shots today receiving second March 18th. Anchorage enters chat. wouldn’t say lot, would say 100% attributed that. I've always wondered use audio clip part everyday rather re-recording every time know someone one 10,000! 

The lab performed top notch, free drive-through PCR testing run extreme efficiency. Results come back 24 hours. Definitely grateful them. 

In article, mentioned literally drove Chick Fil drive-through modeled drive-through operation CFA, lol. Climate change remember set new ones, thinking numbers seemed far away.

It's like 2 weeks since then!!! 🎉🎉🎉 Sorry, anticipated repost. dutch study referenced men specifically glasses lower odds getting covid due touching eyes less, sample size like -300 see India actually exported vaccines South America believe. India world leading vaccine infrastructure imo. point make sense though I’m pedantic. think they’re focusing bad news we’re woods yet. Like I’m encouraged vaccine numbers, thousands people still dying everyday US. think something idea ethics reason people get complacent prematurely. 

AND think something said suffering caused pandemic largely ignored many people power. shifting news toward positive stories pandemic nearing end takes focus real aid many people still need. obsessed invalidating study stance it’s clear anyone knows worked minimum wage job United States worker protections insufficient

I'm obsessed invalidating anything, trust index rankings read several always flaws. hard boil something complex ""worker rights"" single number without introducing tons bias.

I studied Cato freedom index well Universal Human Rights index suffer issue. said, need time look new index pass judgment Yayayayayayayay ""experts"" 

That says right there. wish special insight magical thinking allowed know experts! Open windows ? post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* things pointing summer absolutely bomb! look see there's things bad worse Fox. Reddit especially bad this: good calling righty bullshit huge, huge blindspots lefty bullshit.

Half outlets exactly Fox is, left, absolute /r/politics darlings. They'll probably extend closure situation remains bad. think legally force private businesses close ""until notice"". need give people end date, even date subject change later on. People spend money energy trying it.

True, unfortunate, thing required weight loss calorie reduction (which free!) Instead scape-goating Mrs von der Leyen look way mess created.

Like closing vaccine gap Sputnik V Sinovac. think Germany bad? look neighbors, Czech Republic. believe ever return “normal”after COVID. time won’t wear masks everywhere, mean life return experience pandemic. seriously think could idealistic “return” borderline naive. barely paying teachers fair salary 

That's fixed many places. even still hear line local teachers making median wages city straight college. Starting teachers making starting police wages, 184 days year 6.5 hour day (I know often drags more, many districts often doesn't...). add summer work before/after school mentoring watching jobs, end quite bit state police (even overtime, clamped pretty sufficient supplies.

Yup, huge damn problem. Next thing fix. Instead going PTA meetings trying involved, typically give $5k PTA start year buy needed teacher supplies keep stock. Honestly buy ridiculous amount school supplies little money, reason can't ever seem find savings it. summer 2009 (right Obama elected) congress allocated money schools update HVAC systems make energy efficient. school building built 1999 got money even though relatively new building time. know money spent across country, school (according understanding custodian explained - lots room error misunderstanding here) refurbished could recirculate internal air already heated, thus saving energy. also air filter kind. know kind often cleaned changed. 

The problems recirculated air pandemic obvious. know researchers working cheap, effective laser system would ""scrub"" air pathogens sending back system. idea seems like could relatively cheap/quick fix existing systems depending many schools updated 2009 - 2010 like mine.   Folks managed develop, test manufacture vaccine new virus start rolling vaccine less 12 months people still complain isn’t fast enough. Like wow.   Post-viral syndromes real, don’t doubt many viruses, cases covid result post-viral syndrome, think good proportion today’s “long-covid” attributed psychological causes. course people act like that’s offensive thing say, it’s not, means need taking psychological causes way seriously Lol never said wasn’t Seriously... Folks free endanger lives others'. pick different fucking line work... people disgust me. Sure, prefer get numbers primary sources. need editorial. think forgot math.  Well... export ban too? Who's going stop them?  way Covid unfortunately absurd level Peter Singer esque collective responsibility eventually leaves society paralyzed protect society. 

My Master's degree philosophy eventually gets philosophical considerations- I'll ask, everyone living simply help others catch COVID, anyone whose function able enjoy receiving help? empty goal offer hypothetically rescue COVID. I’ve seeing lots articles reopening. Makes happy :,) agree people traveling NOW. People stopped giving af ago. niece brother laws daughter, got much say really. first time heard like oh wow rushed last part. every single show haha. Yes. know post-viral syndrome real thing viruses besides COVID; got mild case years ago nasty GI virus. But, I'm wondering many people think long haul COVID actually lockdown fatigue maybe PTSD top it. No, criticize right wing politicians damn day without repercussion.  wish. help me. Try running ventilation system staying 6' apart masked. tight areas gotta cram quite people them.

&amp;#x200B;

Definitely supply one though. Would say 400 troops died war? risked lives care people. covid deniers ignored health guidelines. paid ultimate consequence life. must terrifying knowing duty patients access adequate vaccines constantly overworked 1+ years. 400 something diminish. addressing mile-wide logical holes 'argument.'

You grasp data, sociological implications advocating, even good handle arguing first place. 

The world Reddit. VAST majority general population never, ever going get board mandatory vaccines. Ever. Either figure deal it, go elsewhere. understand that, entire departments going roof dancing. important diagnostic screenings pushed aside lack staff, crazy ask questions. significant differences thr technology use still. Sounds really familiar... words, vaccine changes nothing. There's posts estimates. think actual number 3-4 times official one.  discussing whether virus travel via ventilation.

\-- think answers giving situations correct. probably primary focus (which asking non vaccinated people continue distancing get vaccine, Summer many). ignore AZ definition mild J&amp;J calls moderate. agree procurement side.
Could tell say smaller size make better inherent oportunity success ignore EU chose band together procument (big EU vs small UK) - continue comparing UK DE/FR/IT limit supply already established limited procurement? like saying wanna compare 100m race invalid - ambitious productive. matter compare suply limit, roll-out. Abd mainland europe starts getting suplies ramped roll-out faster - overtake UK steady flow.
No, would states nation-states.
Probably dont, last time drinking scots wanna leave union called it- unions normally leave.  Sometimes option staying home, unfortunately. Stop reading CNN. awful. read far long gone downhill far 20 years ago. Florida here, home Super Bowl, expecting spike? nurses ICU nurses even ones take breaks fun. Oh Thank you! hero! Thank keeping safe! Finland tiny country 5.5 million people. can't let virus run rampant thing. keep lockdowns enough people vaccinated. Well don’t windows. That’s prevents us opening windows. keep asbestos closet since obviously won’t touch it.

There literally maintenance schools. true months even loosely followed. number reach mask mandates end? number pcr rapid test see basketball game? Remindme! 6/1/2021 Can't wait resume normal life. Less 1 week I'm 2 weeks second shot surprising. gyms ventilate require people wear mask. mean can’t definitely answer. 5-10 people know I’ve talked say things along lines want wait year data. think vaccines tested similar standard approval procedure expedited quickly. I’m comfortable taking yet. It’s mostly based sound logic actual inquiry data gut feeling based logic fear. Like best approach interrogate kind data would actually want see comfortable. don’t answer don’t actually sense would constitute high safety standards. One good thing make clear they’re choosing vaccine nothing like flu let’s say. people don’t get fiu given year. covid likely spread everyone point given infectious unless get large percent oooulation vaccinated. Stress long term effects covid well documented several orders magnitude widespread long term effects covid vaccine exists evidence of. certain point going drop uptake need think ways push people towards vaccination. Meanwhile Canada continue locked basements. smart country would take moment time put forth colossal infrastructure bill, even creating CCC-level organization, rebuild nation's schools. Make safer two fronts, build better ventilation whatever pathogen-resistant measures possible, also build better security help dramatically reduce possible harm done school shooters. mean, government given checks.

But say vaccines give immunity, give full immunity. vaccines six months, still lot know.

Restrictions need anywhere near strict, might need wear mask occasionally. That's asking lot. Pfizer better track record though based trials, terms acute reaction effectiveness preventing infection hospitalisation iirc Test Lysol wipe small area leather. Confirm there's discoloration, wipe rest chair.

Job done, enjoy normal. Remindme! 30 days Ahh gotcha. expecting something immoral something company. Yeah get they’re heavily geared towards cardio &amp; business crowd. membership pandemic since would go 11am usually able get free weights needed (I didn’t use smith machines, really bench press have, maybe 4 sets dumbbell weight) machines needed usually available.

But yeah, fit crowd wanted quickly run lunch break hour, lose weight hopefully put muscle process. impressed $10 even it’s best way lift. antibodies already still wear mask

Why? I've noticed people different goalposts what's fine fine move what's convenient them. family constantly tell people wear masks wash hands, go trips LA Miami think cultural thing US. We've embraced extreme individualism forgot pull together common cause. Even leaders forgot going long. We're relearn great grandparents knew never learned working together. labor rights pay, public health, voting rights. We're mess.

You're totally right (and something I""ve thinking years now). 

I think going super super super hard thing fix (if even fixable). 

* want little bit ""rugged individualism"".. certainly want people ""blindly following crowd"". want people self-reliant self-sufficient enough ""think themselves"" able understand ""when crowd wrong"". 

* also want swing far opposite direction.. get people ""ruggedly-individualistic"".. know team-players support community. 

That ""middle-ground"" area strive for.. bit nuanced balance. takes life-experience successes failures (and self-awareness) .. sort train build person understand difference benefits individualism versus community-teamwork. That's easy thing achieve (on mass-level need achieve on). zero, may never get zero, headed right direction expect reach point relax, couplefew months...

...*because* people like me. mask wearers vaccine takers take-out eaters.

People claimed overblown, helping, get take credit current status direction curve.

They certainly can't call shots whether we're ""completely"" woods.

Talk couple months. incredibly effective counts: preventing death hospitalization. participant AZ trial ended offered Pfizer work. asked study doc thought take Pfizer vaccine AZ efficacious. recommended major acute side effects taking both, get end result: keeping dying keeping hospital. Locking works reduce cases reducing transmission opportunities. person normally interacts 50 people day lock cuts 10 masking distancing limiting chances spread, that’s significant reduction opportunities transmission. So, no, it’s naive try reduce spread via lock downs. 

More contagious variants spread circumstances variants spread; doesn’t magically spread.

The new variants make reducing spread critically necessary prevent surges people infected time. lengthen pandemic? Sure saves millions lives. 

Consider: every infected person could receive medical care necessary survive, death rate probably 2%, possibly 1% healthier populations.

However, ICU/respiratory support limited, death rate passes 10%; roughly third cases need medical support. many might approve shrugging 10+% national global population, would absolutely devastate medical systems mortuary industries leave severe impacts every industry including food processing distribution. like paying $9 bucks pound beef? Enjoyed tp shortages 2020?

 Plus wanna tell nation’s kids suck wave goodbye grandma grandpa via Zoom? Grandparents lot important things families lucky enough them. random 20-50 somethings would succumb, unnecessary deaths, while, yes, gonna die anyway, modern economy based folks living productive lives 60s continuing spend money well past 70s.  


Prolonging pandemic via shutdowns annoying, painful, economically bad, however, rushing ”herd immunity“ via rapid infection spread try preserve economy would **way** destructive. Literally penny wise, pound foolish, exact shit regular folks buying electricity ”I’ll save $50 bucks month 5 years pray emergency pushes bill $10k”; yeah that’s great. 

Perhaps I’d receptive position knew dead 10+% consisted short-term thinking grasshoppers holding humanity back good, practical ant things. ensure never ends

It's literally ending. Anyone eyes see almost everywhere world, lockdown restrictions rolled back vaccinations ramp up. Breath... countless stories half gym crowd wearing chin, breathing hard can. God damn, universe brutal. It’s fake news, article even gets Indian vaccine yet approved, reports India pushes home grown vaccine without choice despite yet passed trials. I'm make safe. approach is, start presumption schools open, much make safe, recognizing imperfections limitations. approach many seems ""not safe."" Even worse definition ""safe"" becomes slippery. schools able ventilation others, able greater distancing others, able testing. able masking. vaccination widely available school staff want soon. 

Start ""schools open, let's make safe realistically opening them"" instead ""let's make sure everything safe open schools."" That's difference. feel wrong share.

As Canadian I'm grateful. No, requires defesting entire host hormones brain chemical systems designed stop voluntarily losing weight, havingnto engage actions trigger low level. seniors locked even alone young people forced stay home. wish cool. actually incredibly useful. Never worn near fanny, though. Vulnerable, essential workers, ect... wrap March. April May could, pretty much barring catastrophic circumstances, “open season.” False equivalency. Gyms promote physical mental health overall wellbeing. Drunk driving wreckless dangerous behavior, mention illegal. compare two takes impressive mental gymnastics. Right!? love getting pole every time! talking about.

The people getting vaccinated choice used. People aren’t going go line potentially get worthless vaccine hasn’t even made phase three trials.

India destroyed confidence vaccine process misguided nationalism. country it, truly better. LTC/hospitals? standard typically ward goes outbreak refuse flu vaccine, you’re required wear mask. Perhaps entire flu season staff wearing masks unwilling get flu shot, that’s outbreaks come it’s clear they’re effective.  keep jabbing much want keep making immune. already Windows 10 Pro Office 365 microchips anything me. interpretation well. end May set. want know ellipticals pubes significant amount? emergency medical personnel currently eligible, people day job.

The avg Hans Schmidt can't roll get vaccinated.  2 2 context. They’re giving quantifiable level risk. don’t mention near zero chance serious illness death. reason mentioned last comment, statement saying “but, risk” makes sound like higher level risk generally find acceptable. 

People browsing dozens COVID articles every day might already know level risk low, can’t expect everyone country read lines every statement hear news. sounds like saying “you definitely see vaccinated friends you’re vaccinated... soon.” every statement mixed set vague warnings hesitation? Even questions specific, can’t commit saying “yes.” probably sometime May. means April May probably open season. 


If correct interpreting “60-90 days everyone wants one (50-70% US Adults) vaccine.” mean article states Moderna deliver 30-35M doses March. means they'll 20M-30M doses short Pfizer might even worse condition. Basically, way they'll deliver 25M doses week end March order meet contract requirements...  yup, every freaking start vaccination like ""at rate going take seven years vaccinate whole population"" ... people remember long took testing ramp up? Kern. Also today news state asked local DA press charges several times past months restaurants refused. Misleading headline, relevant batch paused, AZ doses. Yes, ""Reddit"" came word that's commonly used Europe, wrote actual headline article trigger you. alone. ""Jab"" leaves sore taste mouth reason. Nobody ever created mRNA vaccine either, tried immunizing billions people, range highly effective safe vaccines quickly...

&amp;#x200B;

I want say done something mean can't. Based Bloomberg's vaccine tracker, NY FL basically neck neck right now. I'm sure NY loosened strict tiering system changed something else though. first jab tonight England Pfizer. asked Pfizer, idle curiosity anything, told boils turn up. gone Saturday would AZ/Oxford. 'Doesn't matter vaccine, I'm grateful chance, there's money involved bet life malevolent interests involved acting best interests. huge surprise find Oxford best vaccine data comes through. Private company interests promoting vaccines made money concerned. 

This great us, however: turn AZ/Oxford 'til cows come home we'll want. odd. many news stories sub since mid-summer flu crushed southern hemisphere (when normally rages), could light year flu northern hemisphere result. reddit short memory. Proving point. Cali extreme measures-- help always end world it?

Always rapture, apocalyptic flood, nuclear war, communism, virus, WHO, politicians, media...blah blah blah.

Congrats! next line so-called Nostradamus's failed predict downfall civilization. Mine regularly patrol looking people wearing fully covering nose mouth! NEW: Pres. Biden estimates ""maybe 60 90 days supply adequate"" meet demand want Thursday drop bad news day... Get fucked. glossing millions fatalities parody optimism. pieces shit like breed antimaskers. Hey biggy! Shits getting better...
get fucked. I'm sorry feeling great right now. yes conclusion spot - backed science. get are, harder vaccine works immune system still potent. guess silver lining.

But hope feel better soon. Take care. April &amp; May. practically closed. research shitting reddit😑 away tests permanently. favor wealthier students choose sides logic reality.

on nose, one Stop spreading fake news😑 makes sense, well hope really speed vaccine production. much love introvert acceptable would like able go travel. week basically 0. protection kicks around day 10-12 Drowning get vaccine seems like poor decision. admit every time hear long-haulers freaking symptoms, get disability, life completely changed even though look same, can't help think, ""welcome life chronic fatigue chronic pain sufferer due fibromyalgia, Hashimoto's, couple autoimmune disorders. hey, generally look okay 30-something therefore I'm supposed function regular work hours rest taking shower.""

If become normal ""healthy"" people complain chronic pain fatigue, hope build sympathy us who've chronic pain fatigue long COVID came around, yet half time even doctors useless get (my rheumatologist (mind you, second one I've seen) actually suggested meditate pray, since far none pain medications I've taken done anything substantial except give brain fog make face bloated). history, can-do attitudes came leaders gave people mission. Rosie Rivieter, Uncle Sam's ""I WANT YOU!"" campaign, WW2 rationing ""Victory Gardens."". Yeah, call propaganda - propaganda extremely dangerous - that. message, gave us degree cohesion, gave everyman woman something believe scary unknown time. ""keep calm carry on"" moment. 

Well, we're going honest could've used kind unifying motivation lot year ago well, instead got ""LIBERATE MICHIGAN!"" basically telling voters wearing mask means party. criticized lack leadership told ""this states handle themselves, federal government can't run issues top down"". one's managed unite people around pandemic whole last year really much faith anyone either. agreed late 2019/early 2020 would say there's way would still antibodies around time actually antibody tests too! Really biggest difference poles shared we're wearing masks quality air cities bad, fresh? No. Hot? Yes cold? Also yes. schools know do, don’t funds. Yes, seems huge us. mean restaurants 100%, Fenway &amp; Gillette open along wedding venues, etc. longest time felt like taking couple steps forward 10 steps back. feels like massive jump!  idea, trust experts that. think mitigation efforts still warranted, even people get vaccinated, far concerned. seems reasonable think see population vaccinated, mitigation efforts promoted even rest year (I mean lockdowns things like masks standing top one another line grocery store) drugmakers develop booster shots deal variants, much like seasonal flu shots. get back close pre-COVID ever get, seasonal boosters needed. infinite lockdowns, wild free unconcerned normalcy either little while. statement disprove claims, though. 

Unreported cases that. unknown. find silly lean anything beyond fact know, make convenient scenarios make point cannot proven outside anecdotal evidence hard data exists. 

No one saying feelings may triggered. hurt. claim. claim societies real world always imperfect. always stupid people, always assholes. So, anyone deluded perfect societies 0 crime due human fallacy, hypocracy, violent tendencies? least tiny minority people? everyone fair. everyone reasonable. Poverty still thing. given large population, albeit improve, still seem equate indignant comments here. 

Since also going information article contextualized data. mean, data wrong. Incorrect, people, including me, BioNTech/Pfizer jab. I'm sorry hear that. Hopefully vaccine available sooner rather later everybody feel comfortable hanging out. look me, look average American taxpayer want pay taxes. also helps pole sort naturally distanced. need maintain space want take pleaser face! also wanted add many us healthcare workers suffering going suffer PTSD pandemic. We're used wearing masks social distancing hearing grim news good news sounds ""unreal"" us fears another surge may come we'll go lockdown.  Welll... ""Fool once, shame you. Fool twice, shame me""... school uses ""open windows"" technique.

Now get hear full volume speakers folklore PE class grades Nono, get it, they're *manly* men. Super tough! damn virus would dare infect them!

Can pweeese work wid'out mask? Pwetty pweese wid chewwy top?! Tegel vaccination centres Berlin, give AstraZeneca product, fewer 200 people turning 3,800 daily appointments.

Are sure Goverment? Sounds like people picky me. great article discussed people since reading it.  sensationalism news nothing new year makes angry. Enough. don’t need know next snowstorm today.  getting year finally hope close horizon! tell say smaller size make better inherent oportunity success ignore EU chose band together procument (big EU vs small UK) - continue comparing UK DE/FR/IT limit supply already established limited procurement? 

Because established all. true. 

Have look link: pretty clear addition supply chain issues handled high level, roll also would states nation-states. Probably dont, last time drinking scots wanna leave union called it- unions normally leave.

The word 'union' relevant term here. word want 'sovereign state' that's exactly United Kingdom is. agree people want leave that's fine comparing UK leaving EU same. point flaw - note American also considered 'union' described (hence state union address) guess what? illegal leave USA state too. Even were, amazing Reddit highly skeptical vaccinating obese people, intensely eager vaccinate prisoners. going base vaccine priority individual's morals, let's least consistent. We’ve got free marketer here. ‘sourceS’?

Also think states control companies lol?  Responsibility? Please. whatever want blame one person. place 200 people day turning capacity 3000 day? People avoiding giving AZ vaccine. Well trust AZ unconditionally then? friends two groups. Either people care mitigating risk people want meet all. can't meet person either group unfortunately. Yeah understand starting this. went Canada work last year. true. I’m Canada day told friend impressed USA’s vaccine rollout. response “I wouldn’t exactly look US model success fighting virus”. Bruh, what? Ya, stumbled harder countries, we’re seeing looks like there’s millions vaccines given day. Another example people focus negatives. Gas mask?  I'm optimistic medical community, worried people try screw things up. retired engineer great disasters caused one two groups. first group politicians, biased news organizations twitter idiots know nothing, add misinformation. second group accounts money purse string people want prove worth continually cutting budgets project becomes useless failure. I'm saying real thing, someone anxiety issues straight symptoms. Long Covid definitely exists, also self reported symptoms anyone health anxiety say still feel covid leaves system officially updated yet, would 1.8 million doses today. peace love, please seek help. You’re overly aggressive something doesn’t concern whatsoever.  hate boner sub EU amazing. surgical masks allowed pretty much cloth mask. don’t seal don’t filter anything, air goes around. 

Are German people provided daily FFP2? need disposed use provide filtering value maintain sterile environment. NYC already opening indoor events... hope trolling. not, I'm going critique poor writing poor grammar. pretty unacceptable went HS, scored 1480 SAT still can't figure place comma period 😳 dad us ignorant this. things. Happens. enable paranoid bullshit. Nobody's trying exterminate black people Pfizer. would argue even worse folks US Europe accord followed strict lockdown rules New Zealanders, entire year, watching friends family live semi-normal lives. Finland announcing lockdown March.

This marks one year COVID restrictions. entirely. translate American terms, would like Medicare 85% people, 15% people (mostly rich) private, for-profit insurance. public (Medicare-like) health insurers offer less identical coverage identical cost (7% income deducted source). copays – go doctor hand insurance card it. doctors get identical reimbursements services. actually good system know navigate – feel like excellent access healthcare here. However, disadvantage lot fragmented one body everyone's healthcare data – think case traditional socialized system like UK's NHS. lack centralization disadvantage comes organizing mass vaccination program. end fall/Turkey Day ppl resumed ""normal"" socialization regardless. point decide risk level is. Movie theaters open, theme parks, bars &amp; restaurants. office complexes fully open, employees returning part week least. Depending virulent variants are, CDC issue recommendations different cohorts. 40 greater risk hospitalized rollover accident like famous golfer covid. grandparent may decide mask holiday gatherings. choice yours, vast majority Americans immunized public health becomes Private. watched fully-vaccinated friend get shamed Facebook yesterday asking OK stop wearing mask outside walk properly distanced others.  chorus of, ""It's safe!"" ""You could asymptomatic carrier!"" 

This shitty public health messaging general scientific illiteracy leads - large chunk society thinking somehow dangerous fully-vaccinated person outside fresh air without mask on. Nope, way around, UK receives vaccines made EU (both BioNTech AZ). Also, true UK real export ban, allow anything leave orders fulfilled, long away. then, would sense block exports rather make money.   yet govt doubled today saying we'll enough September moderna pfizer commentbon astrazeneca JJ appovals. Like yes frontline workers take please. province Frontline workers looking July August right now. variants hearing places locked hard either. They're coming places little possible.

Reality is, takes one good enough mutation kick us back several months rendering vaccine inadequate. real possibility people aggressively working hard make happen, despite stupid is. Japan weird vaccination reason. you’re triggered use “righteous”, pretend it’s 1987 she’s holding surfboard says it. What’s 65% effectiveness vs Ohizer 95% breakdown? Would still take J&amp;J? LOL FEEL government fucked up.medical experiments past kinds groups people (soldiers, prisoners, orphans, mentally ill, pregnant women...) many White.

I'm beyond fed moronic argument. world general medical ethics particular changed whole lot last half century+.

Everyone getting vaccines. US, whole world. (And case Pfizer, vaccine even developed UD, Germany. Imagine Israel used logic?) Usually giant open-plan vaccination centers hundreds people media presence around. exactly imagining top secret experiment Black people carried out? why? thats side effect democracy.

humans rarely stones say STFU, i'm right thing even costs political career. sure. Good luck everything high school ends Indeed, better never become obese (or start heroin) first place. disagree. sure US doubt theatres restaurants 100% capacity summer. Heck, they're already cancelling outdoor events July Maine. Ridiculous im state next it, go lot tho Shit, saying 3M death certainty, even lockdowns. lockdowns spread people dying, prevent people dying. idea could prevent ridiculous China it. everyone's acting like ""correct"" course action day one obvious, Trump selfish Americans. they? well versed Brazilian politics current leader someone I'd expect mandatory vaccination May ask restriction(s) would still support why? (Assuming saying would support full normal) say pure ignorance literally something happened. uh dude experiment like generation ago. US apologised 92. 

For reason people keep thinking segregation discrimination recent. really? saving 40 bucks month.. true all. seem less effective preventing infection SA variant, vaccines appear fantastic job preventing serious illness/hospitalizations. ultimately goal, we’re never going eradicate COVID-19, need less serious disease move lives. indications, current vaccines (maybe Oxford, need data) known variants. lot immune response antibodies well, vitro studies account for. MRNA vaccines specifically high efficacy origin strain, near ten-fold reduction neutralizing antibodies may even mean much. going gym since everyone wears mask  correct, I’m sure reddit didn’t invent it. guess meant overly unnecessarily used reasons mentioned, really point making. Yet focused minute detail, sure I’m one triggered chief? i'm enjoying EU/UK sequel please guys, waste vaccines other. Visit linked subreddit risk. may high amount misinformation.

One biggest complaints  Trump handling virus (and many) trying force experts say serious is. serious, see that.

However ""listen science"" mantra goes bit far reaction listen zero science mantra previous administration.

The simple fact matter science public policy. eyes experts job, course they're going say keep everyone locked homes years end stop virus...that science talking. science behind virus part public policy whole thing. point governments allow citizens move around live like 2019, sustainable. 

So go wrong? media companies can't help get hands virus information clicks views. bring Fauci words taken context, outlets taking seriously pull scientists may right something horribly wrong things. 

We're putting much emphasis science says do, science really dictate done. government state feds planning distancing/masking/closures years, shit cautious state union beginning open indoor dining areas today. get benefits gym without gym. lot people poor can't even afford gym membership. gym membership luxury. get equal mental health stability literally talking brisk walk jog outside. boost endorphins. give many health benefits. lift weights body weight exercises home. tons online classes communities virtual workouts. gym necessity. definitely first world problem. gf got second shot today. Can't wait with! Back domestic violence kinda norm though gyms 200 per year - monthy base 10, annual fee around 45 50 so. They’ve little supply administer thus far, real test coming weeks. hope rise challenge, course. actually could copy paste pls  way anyways.

Have someone submit data points collected administered return whether got negotiate new contracts temporarily summer every teacher requiring get board this. Good luck that. We’ve also lockdown since November. stores closed you’re legally allowed see one person/household. really frustration comes government happy extend lockdown refuses put needles arms. things don’t majorly pick soon, lot people going say “fuck it” stop playing ball restrictions. I’ve live, we’ve really nice weather past week people already starting break rules. know you’ve done goofed even Germans breaking rules. fat cuz fat people clearly care health right? Lose weight take vitamin D/C weak virus that’s way overhyped sorry. I'm sorry 7-year-old difficult time. Breaks heart too. really hope things get better year. should’ve reality check cashed announced would get vaccine first.... grocery workers weren’t among jobs.

I guess grocery workers bigger suckers virus. Ontario Alberta administered 88% 90% supply far, higher almost provinces. UK isn’t studying AZ Moderna/Pfizer follow far know. however AZ/Sputnik combo trial: said, viral vectors makes sense. need things. work outside (running walking) buy weights inside house. investment? Yes. us saved $$ past year paying gym membership. take $40/month saved thats hundreds dollars. need anything fancy. crossfit streaming classes P90x. lot work body weight heavier dumbbells. 

There people go gym use treadmill elliptical weight machines. Like, really? EASILY done outside home.  Sounds good me. risk vaccinated get one mask goes trash. According article, best case situation. considering places country where, now, regular folks may access vaccines April, May, June... also using guesses herd immunity - specifically US need 72% threshold another guess 110 million people already contracted disease. numbers debatable neither proven fact.

This optimistic perspective that's great. stated certainty, even source quotes article. Uh what?

No, vaccine largely made available entire elderly population. There's still significant shortages many areas, especially minority heavy communities. That's fact. check many states see that's true. Texas example finished nursing homes long ago, still working going 1b, includes everyone 65+ people high risk conditions. Even vaccine production ramping up, still take significant amount time vaccine production get needs be.

Two, telling someone retire because? Teachers working past 65 likely trying get last years maximize retirement. They've paid dues society; deserve able work get last years in, especially they've done good job throughout career. 

Three, studies shown long haulers 10% recovered cases, many still issues months (like 7+ months) they've recovered. yes, unlikely know COVID-19 cause permanent loss smell, unlikely, 'for sure.' Plus there's people still recovered sense smell 6 months (5% case study looked at). still know extent could potentially happen long haulers. yes, people going want safe rather sorry. done tried shame group people simply want remain safe, especially new data shown schools safe people thought were. Cost life signficantly cheaper here. still massively underpaid though , teachers. Instructions unclear; gouged eyes Sam Neil told need we're going. Yup... I'll passing it. IMO (I'm guy, however) really change positive projections elsewhere sub ""we're close normal"" articles coming out. Virus running time gain steam mount significant comeback. happened Dec. it'd concerning think. Yes, see, complaining Redditors Reddit ultimate form ex-shitty hipster turned alt-righter. Ohhhh noooo. I'm here... I'm fan J&amp;J wait one mRNA vaccines. I'll getting second dose week so. full immunity I'm definitely going eat (outdoor dining), indoor gym, getting nails done, shopping person instead using delivery, hanging vaccinated people. I've followed rules pretty strictly whole time. I'm looking forward going dinner dates husband :) millions things injected single human? yeah true valid points Care share link evidence vaccines work CA, NY, known variants far? many people claim gyms safe. Indoor dining safe. Smh. None ""safe"". obvious many people. saw 999 comments wanted even 1,000. all. Yes. significant reduction antibodies, however still enough neutralize virus. 

J&amp;J's trials showed shot 57% effective South Africa still higher FDAs minimum efficacy vaccine. Funny say that. covid vaccine clinic hectic people run brought manager chic fil operate it. Heard radio weeks back don’t source I’m sure it’s somewhere That’s cool. mom lives TX—she’s 70s along 80+ stepdad brother who’s 50s developmental disabilities gotten shots. keeps telling get waiting list keep explain NC, you’re part currently eligible group, can’t get waiting list. far, healthy care workers 65 eligible added teachers today. reddit comments rly get downvoted reason found this, regarding less science cartoon talking about. ""P1"" Brazil may line concerns; though seems still thankfully limited spread. said, /r/COVID19 bunch stuff right vaccine impact various strains. 


 [Variants SARS-CoV-2 - Fwiw, I've heard categorize introverts *recharging* alone extroverts recharging among people. can't vouch categorization, say feel fits better. introverts I've known consider one certainly recharge alone.

It's like fingernails chalkboard I'm already amped concert something recharge soon after. according keikaku. figure? (British Voice): much indeed! excuse good sir prepare return nightclub mere 117 days good sir. pick dead grandpa ""being lonely"". would pick latter. let people decide want take risk; freedom selfishness Make rule vaccinated people attend sporting events America vaccinated within month.   
I’m even kidding. Right now, everyone says it’s right get vaccinated. Make requirement get stadium everyone America howling demand right vaccine. Oh sure it’s gonna daily exposure therapy. We’ve spent last year asking “is safe this” every time go building. doesn’t shut overnight Pretty much. Maybe July crowded places, since that's we'll able vaccinate everyone (or least enough vaccine adults). people want everyone vaccinated, need send teachers back unvaccinated, vaccinate teachers, mathematically vaccinate everyone else?

Nothing slippery slope argument makes sense, makes head fucking hurt.

Just vaccinate fucking teachers first. fucking it. hard.

The whatever fuck want kids, care. mitigation suppression really work Covid. safe level open things back always end exponential growth again. Elimination strategy allows safely open back cases zero. see layer protection. None full-proof added top makes less likely catch covid. vaccine another layer. FDA essentially bought paid large pharmaceutical companies like Johnson Johnson...doesn’t concern people? equivalent Budweiser endorsing alcohol  That's said ""assuming US"", key word ""assuming"". File under: obvious things known since start people workout outside. Oh gosh Florida, completely get it. in-laws 80s got waiting list week. Gyms confirmed spreading grounds covid. amazes people try argue otherwise.  Cardio mask sucks. suuuuccccccccccckkkks ugh hate agree there

But I’m either gonna wear workout all. I’ve actually lucky winters aren’t bad live run outside strength train garage, away people, odd times day. everyone feel them- can’t wait we’re sufficiently vaccinated. Yup. Shows actually read damn article. Exercise classes != working mask POC poor, ffs. See you’ve conflated demographics?

e: obesity isn’t older white thing poor thing. It’s everyone thing, knows age barrier US. Colombian government tens millions doses already secured. Sinovac two 1 deliveries next month alone. AZ, Pfizer, coming. 

Colombia started late, however, catching seems little risk running doses like neighbors. isn’t supposed yearly vaccine thing, it’s supposed one shot deal. End pandemic, get us back normalcy. much like vaccines got kids. think came first place? huge need. We, today, making history new pandemic. need times, right now. honestly can’t understand people defending vaccine. “settling” polio vaccine arrived? sure hope didn’t. calling disgusting inappropriate. split hairs, looking data vaccine supply extremely low, we’re using supply don’t much line-cutting, imo rollout hasn’t anywhere near would qualify disaster. much weight need gain? Could good challenge /s  remember back covid video going around someone attached gopro bottle fireball wedding record everyone taking pulls throughout night. amount people acting like germ equivalent ass-to-mouth orgy ridiculous. Like ever party before? unvaccinated people interact meeting vaccinated friends?

There isn’t much risk *to people vaccinated*, still need mindful meeting vaccinated people still leave infected risk people around you. Prove it. data vaccinated folks legitimate threat virus spread. Furthermore, can’t vaccinated people self select hang vaccinated people without shamed?  know lol. regulars back gym it’s great see. ""nothing fundamentally changed"" 2 vaccines, cases 70%, yeah still blown apocalypse there.  Yeah analyzed every risk take life like couldn’t function! I’m car right now, that’s risk. I’m going snowboarding, another risk. Crossing street walking somewhere? risk. Etc. Unvaccinated people going around unvaccinated people huffing puffing gyms indoors working out, that's issue. Two vaccinated people dinner together issue. think house voting Friday. Surely wouldn’t decline appointments Biontech vaccine still supplied. However approval another vaccine significant increase appointments , similar UK start Jan. Korean citizens wide access KF94s European countries mandating FFP2 respirators. 

The fact get anything cloth masks months ridiculous. Oh sorry, misunderstood post, bad. Bay county schools FL following CDC guidelines putting children entire community risk. It’s excuse. Trump turned things states things went hell bc top standard. lot governors fucked royally. done well. 

I referring federal talking health authorities. Australia’s population less populations California Texas little population Florida. 

New Zealand less half population Chicago metro area. 

They also advantage island nations completely cut outside world strong central governments. Comparing Australia New Zealand country 330 million people decentralized government comparing apples oranges. need look countries like Spain Italy locked incredibly hard know would never eliminated virus U.S. last thing world needs science become even subordinate politics.

Science subordinate politics always. Science servant, politics master. Science tells things are, importantly, *not* do. role politics. Schools prime example this. lots studies school closing causing negative effects children listed some). effects weighted positive effects school closures stopping virus spread. weigh things question science can't answer. role politics. Scientific conclusions supposed influenced people want need true. 

This course true, question ""should children return school"" *not* question scientific conclusion. scientific conclusion may return, R0 covid increases X. return, economic impact negative impact children Z. politics weigh different effects other. Maybe yearly, like flu. face really ugly what? Im seriously asking lol Prove it. Absence evidence evidence. Odds probably well protected first moderna shot fine.

But right thing getting tested sure. Vaccines 100% effective. mean comment different post? Yep. blame Trump's attitude hate got right. People hated Obama made crazy shit nobody could say dumb, disrespectful unprofessional.

I'm sure conservative threads they're making huge deal this. work healthcare one relative got positive coughing experiment started. Amen. numbers don’t sure right now. 7 day average right 68,000~. Three days ago 67,000~. took AMOUNT cases reported either didn’t read kind agenda took said it’s 7 day average. Humans gross? Lol Yea actually switched p90x hesitancy. used to, tell ya never flexible life. 

However, weight loss program good people trying gain weight. fuck ton pushups, pull ups, jumps squats. modify bit pleasantly surprised amount endurance gained it. get Tony's stupid jokes, decent program end day. make sweat that's sure. Lol last year makes college worth it.

Maybe me, freshman year WAY fun senior year. Graduation one depressing experiences I've ever had. asymptomatic cases common symptomatic cases?

If so, yes anything likely get show symptoms get show symptoms.

I could wrong thinking something else, though. look reporting variants. Cases deaths fallen cliff countries since Jan, many news stories contagious maybe deadly variants. real cases falling 50-80% around world (including variant locations like UK California) stories theoretical huge spike variants get top billing. sorry feel alone, contest, know? lot schools falling apart decades. Expecting fix ventilation systems wishful thinking.   Good god, always poop? live country's capital city two million people people wear mask outside. roll Canada disaster?  I'm highrisk covid complications bc asthma/history respiratory infections stepdad still going local planet fitness taking mask lift weights. understand one wearing masks there. feel like health countdown timer. 3 days ago, cases 68k (7 day avg), today 72k. important thing cases longer going down. Deaths also 2k 2.3k period. Hospitalizations also leveling declining long time. test positivity rate nation-wide longer declining. metrics point towards start another increase. understand people want pandemic over, numbers lie.  I’m sure vaccinations playing role. It’s BIONTECH developed vaccine. Pfizer. Ffs yes, flu frankly risk mutate become pandemic covid ever be. It’s disgusting inappropriate. middle eastern woman whose country got invaded religious extremists? No? zero right comment dictate middle eastern women grew and/ lived Islamic extremist countries view world. ideal breeding ground flu outbreak. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* carnival well data science sole factor, different fields well public health, else would use make decisions? comes point decide want scar generation kids life masks, distancing, recess prevent trivial amount child covid deaths adults vaccinated. Ideally, politicians would take account advice *all* experts, public health, mental health, economists, come informed inclusion. Donald showed necessarily trust make evaluations, that's needle swung much direction ""public health experts god."" head CDC political appointee would normally lead messaging pandemics, evaluating advice scientists *politician* would send message believed best. void, public health experts stepped directly fill this, people scientists, way equipped tailor message would reach tens millions people. Why, yes, yes is! reading scientists suggesting change roll little get j&amp;j 19-25 year olds ASAP stop community spread, especially people go back college. There’s data ones travel contribute spread. keep mRNA vaccines anyone age range. 

This seemed really reasonable me, feeling people would freak government said going start vaccinating young people first. don’t think I’ve seen “woman working Ford’s next ad campaign” example “average working American” like it. Probably pretty accurate. time news, log off, breath. almost there. number 2 rough lots people seek shelter others homes. ie. gf's brother needed place sleep get water from. got link that? I've never heard flu shot eliminating disease entirely? Tonight Solved Mysteries, repeated studies show fomite transmission COVID ""overexaggerated"" ""extremely unlikely"". someone explain means find new strain Covid? saw new strain UK, new strain Africa, new strain NY really sure means? virus mutating? DNA person UK different someone NY?
I believe heard flu different year requires new shot year, never really known much basic concept. 

Thanks Probably 3 variants entered 1 cell got instructed 3 variants make copy, resulting combined variant. Lemon bed. Definitely. Agree 100%. 

But people still need something. Anything. matter small. Start somewhere. 

No matter persons limitations (lack money, lack space, lack time, disabled, whatever).. still SOMETHING. Anything. Even tiny. 

Make tiny change eat. Make tiny change walk dog play frisbee kids. Make exercise fun integrating activities (example:.. lot walking,. I'm also Geocaching playing Ingress Pokemon things smartphone). Make game ""exploring Parks city"". 

Make list either:

* potential opportunities have

or

* list things limit most.. brainstorm around ideas try figure turn limitations opportunities. can’t play golf? Michigan severe restrictions country, could still go play golf.... received Moderna shots. One week second shot, exposed someone covid. coughing spitting within couple feet hour. wearing surgical mask.

I 7 days quarantine feel fine far. took rapid PCR test I’m waiting results. 

Is possible got covid her, test positive, don’t symptoms? Yeah fuck whiny people it’s right get drunk bar drive home. I’ve paid drinks car. they’re scared car crashes let decide stay road, amirite can't even stop gym bag getting sick gym. Wait, guys gyms open restaurants closed? vaccine already proven effective serious side effects. That’s whole point clinical trials did. Yes both. prevents disease entirely. also evidence reduces severity flu, prevent disease.

Also notably, J&amp;J COVID vaccine significantly effective typical flu vaccine things, especially severity (0 hospitalizations trial, 0 deaths). hear anyone predicting nothing happen?  Stay home scared getting sick, I'm hitting gym wanna get thicc. Illinois we’ve gone 100,000 plus tests per day around holidays around 70,000 per day. That’s still really healthy clip testing positivity rates continue plummet, point people getting tested ones obvious symptoms required employment, school, travel. novelty testing also starting wear many states repurposing staff facilities testing vaccinations, absolutely should. Re: Wiki article. I'm aware children need germ exposure, meant helps grow healthy hygiene habits encourages hand washing, etc. There's difference putting bubble letting touch things poop hands 🤷 lessens risk transmission. eliminate it. agree people vaccinated behave *more normally.* example ""can two vaccinated couples dinner together?"" Yeah, go ahead imo. There's still concern though hanging indoors close contact vulnerable, unvaccinated people. Even vaccinated think I'd go close contact unvaccinated 80 year old (though number diminishing now). flip side though, plan see grandparents second shot, even though I'm unvaccinated. grandma dying able us Easter, probably there. They've gone year hardly seeing family knows long have. Part based much covid still spreading. 80-90% lesser chance spreading it, odds would still ohigh spreading like January risk giving someone. way we're heading? 80-90% reduction odds spreading we're already seeing 80-90% less spread community? Looking lot rosier. Yeah, society level, vaccine great. shuts people up, makes things move little smoother, sure. honest, that’s probably I’m getting downvoted oblivion, government/hospital hacks trying keep peace don’t want hear logical dissenting opinions. truth staring right face — new vaccine approval YOU, it’s society whole. Lmao. I’m glad sensationalized nonsense like finally downvoted be.

You realize average age death Covid 80, right? realize vast majority deaths either obese, diabetic, hypertension, combination those, right?

Does sound like demographic goes gym?

Jesus sometimes wonder people even capable using brains live constant irrational fear. China bus study last January. knew airborn - chose ignore US - reasons I've never That’s whole point vaccine, shes vaccinated go spend time mom. Lol yeah going gym totally thing things. Insanely stupid argument. amount people know post social media MASK UP, SELFISH, etc post pictures eating full restaurants without masks sight kills me. Like wear mask 15 minutes go Publix mean get pontificate go sit packed bar 3 hours. 

In vein, wearing mask 45 seconds takes get restaurant walk table serious fucking theater. Like sitting table bar at-capacity restaurant gives covid shield lmao.

To clear, I'm complaining people going eat whatever, would make hypocrite highest order. fact leaders (Fauci, Biden, etc.) even STARTED put reopening plan, guidance, criminal, IMO.

Things starting get back normal, people getting vaccinated, need guidance! ""Wear masks change behaviors"" acceptable response. Vaccines always end goal, treat such. Tell vaccinated people now! Nah hitting gym since November could well it, lack flexibility maybe?

My experience German systems overwhelmingly bureaucratic. Clearly trying start tradition here. Right bud. Can't wait think mean conscience. People showing vaccination fat suits ...  Yeah guy sucks he's making little bit sense. We're wasting time trying track every one every tier. another disservice media machine pumping out. They’re basically causing people much confidence miracle modern medicine prevent serious illness and, likely, spread virus would Tylenol. helping. terms side effects? referring vaccines. data effective variants except AZ basically 0. Yes. Vaccines lower risk far masks do. many models target though pandemic future thanks science! Lockdowns FAR harm good. Yeah I’m wondering too. don’t live campus housing apt building pretty much students school management advertises way Inject ~~veins~~ muscles! post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

 literally reported today

Johnson &amp; Johnson's vaccine 66 per cent effective preventing COVID-19 multiple variants global trial involving nearly 44,000 people, company said last month.

Its effectiveness varied 72 per cent in United States 66 per cent in Latin America 57 per cent in South Africa, new variant spread, though vaccine 85 per cent effective overall stopping severe cases disease.  According financial times tracker, Croatia behind Canada EU. look advanced economies actively trying widespread vaccinations, Canada among lowest doses given per 100 world. Lol, ok Dan Patrick. Sorry dude, people going tell elderly parents go risk lives future children even related to.

It’s gonna rough wait. get 2 shots vaccine available anyone wants one give fuck anyone else. anything pandemic taught everyone piece shit somehow spread covid unwillingly that's everyone else's problem. $60 month obscenely low “high end” gym. would say upper middle road gym would $100/month $200/month beginning higher end. gym rat COVID, actually tried going back gym outdoors getting vaccinated. Even that, fucking nightmare anyone who's living anyone risk. can't feel ease kind environment, enough data transmission post-vaccine justify protection ""enough"". modify.

Soon enough us vaccinated everything open full capacity anyway. r/NoShitSherlock Thanks, daughter okay. rules respected? Almost nobody outside 6pm. Gyms restaurants closed months now. Mask mandated everywhere Canada take hands! Instead apology, I’d rather sued libel, pay fine make front page announcement retraction.

The whole idea effectiveness misreported.

[this BBC article second paragraph makes seem awful saying:

“It shows vaccine significantly less effective previous data suggested - barely 50% needed regulatory approval.”

Don't get wrong, love working home reasons (and even started *before* COVID). said, always resume up-to-date case... reasons: 

1. Vaccine nationalism
2. Over-representation manufacturing capacity (for first two)
3. Israel sharing data &amp; promising quick rollout Pfizer get earlier doses  know lot music clubs going make it. reopen different ownership likely means different kind club. I'm vaccine, people like employers allowed force drug tests walk us. world needed it, US taking vaccines blocking exports, UK gets vaccines going EU also blocking exports, EU cant get nearly enough vaccines shooting foot bureaucracy, China provides millions vaccines 80 countries free vaccines 53 developing countries. 

And without exposing people handled things right(after while) economy back running full capacity

Traditional injuries take years heal cases many many cases people never run again. coworker ran marathons, injured foot, can't run anymore. 

Shopping groceries necessity people die without food. 

People can't readily go eat live. Indoor dining reopened. 

And yes spoiled complaining terrible global pandemic work outside home. 

Let guess - kids. tell self absorbed attitude never worry anyone anything yourself. friends parents would laugh hard comments. wait kids. gym give up. like 1% it. LOL. 

You sacrifice power lifting covid resolved like everyone else sacrificing everything lives. 

The CDC urging stricter precautions gyms. argue want, want it, much go gym. Shows privileged .100% privileged. Poor people can't even afford gym. People way this.

It sounds like biggest struggled ever life. Boohoo. Poor guy. life. 

This fear either. common sense. want spread virus people, also empathy selfishness. Catching covid athlete lead develop long term symptoms limit ability exercise. I've read lot it. people experience though understand. plenty gyms heavy weight equipment developing countries. I’m pretty shape, haven’t worked regularly almost 5 years trying get back it. However, even basic strengthening exercises tough wearing mask. I’ve resolved low-intensity cardio (bike, maybe elliptical) gym longer requires masks. I’m personally concerned catching virus without mask. I’m smart enough keep distance others, know gym following state mandate.  Decimated means 1 10 lost. 6 10, it’s 6 times worse decimated. toughen up. It’s like you’ve spent months World War 1 style trench. 

The place I’ve indoors since Feb 2020 supermarket. gym non essential. You’ll get muscle back later.

Everyone aware viruses mutate can’t go life living fear every single god damn germ. percentages relative absolute... see confirmation bias full effect. Redditors hate gym they'll amplify even dubious findings pawn irrefutable truth. I'd rather catch covid tbh shit...The point even someone covid didn’t know wouldn’t spread it.  Well large family lot friends colleagues many opted Chinese vaccine (you choose apply among Pfzier, Moderna, Astra Zeneca, Sputnik Sinopharm), since us either health workers teachers (like me), ones priority receive vaccine. personally opted Sinopharm Pfizer allergies afraid side effects, doctor examined got shot also comfortable reccomending it, since technology behind traditional one. Yeah pandemic put gym seen explosion joggers March first started quarantine. Everyone mother suddenly health nut.

Sir, Wendy's. California deaths per million: 1,264  
Florida deaths per million: 1,413

Define ""crushed"" judgement anyone chooses wear masks future. I'm already hearing preemptive shaming people masking indefinitely (especially Flu season). Idk .. something really rubs wrong way, especially spent last year completely downplaying Flu Right, would expect kind people volunteer vaccine research likely follow scientific recommendations average, patterns risky behavior might show up. It’s vindicating see something like this. 2 3 weeks ago sudden shift sub sudden schools opened citing studies Atleast particularly relevant situations. Rural schools wisconsin similar inner city schools Chicago. I'm stoned thought ""emergency"" used emergency. trying figure would involuntarily vaccinate someone reason. urgency made think using like dagger heart like radical nurses ninja throwing knives. Fuck J&amp;J. Sincerely evil corporate entity. “Doesn’t actually pass regulations emergency” IL folks sound like vaccinating people. understanding CA's lockdown measures half-hearted, poorly implemented, even poorly observed. think cite comparison draw conclusion implying. Maybe compare Florida New Zealand fair way slice this? NC lifting restrictions too, announced today. Still though mask mandate. Scare tactics, every single virus mutates accordance environment. fucking course variants. Look ""737 max boeing"". lot articles. pretty big news heavily reported on. read article saying mRNA technology could used cure sorts diseases. One scientists quoted used term ""lifestyle diseases"" category could treated mRNA.

That means start smoking again, right? Roche test says read test 30 minutes. read much result two hours especially since PCR test negative. Imagine mess internet social media. imagine domestic violence fighting one phone line? Osterholm shambles. One biggest things fear address mentally, told slow spread, sheer amount people want lifestyle continue desperate to.


Something wrong mentality. really means virus impact old people assuming zero overlap people who've previously getting vaccinated. cant' add 50-70% top, many people groups.  must slept pandemic.

But looking optimistic! Hope get nice fall college experience :) worth, source seems quote country's vaccination program head. don’t. would happy take it. It’s claiming better vaccine Pfizer false state? mean 90 percent idea

we don't. handful studies yet gone peer review, meaning 0 vetted studies, speculation based viruses. that's it. betting odds REALLY good highly effective transmission, mean CDC say that. still possible early studies wrong, also know well news outlets press releases. CDC says:

""early studies say could cut transmission 87%, studies yet peer reviewed replicated significant portion world, wait data. ""

the headline news sites be:

""CDC says vaccine eliminates transmission, ending reasons social distancing, early studies claim"". readers see ""vaccine eliminates transmission""

so mean time, CDC saying thing know sure, current protocols still help, even vaccinated, continue data. It’s important everyone continue using tools available help stop pandemic learn COVID-19 vaccines work real-world conditions. Experts also looking many people get vaccinated virus spreading communities. also don’t yet know whether getting COVID-19 vaccine prevent spreading virus causes COVID-19 people, even don’t get sick yourself.

These people don’t seem care many people kill violating health codes. resting supplemental oxygen urgent care bring sat RR HR still count need hospitalized necessarily.

At time urgent care taking COVID COVID symptom patients. probably still don't.

And many covid patients appear normal one moment collapse next, low oxygen levels often painless.  saying another comment estimated shot date two years now, I’m Poland too. lot people around refuse shot, saying it’s conspiracy Bill Gates. I’m really frustrated disappointed society general right now. Also fact they’re banning plastic shields doesnt make sense me, wear real masks day one could much smaller crisis general.

Reach nudge friend, may find needed needed them. mind that. I'm bit annoyed hostile attitude discussion. I'm getting blamed bad faith arguments asking sources data used make claims. stating sources arguments (especially asked others) like bread butter discussion, especially group like must full misinformation. I'll say gym Tokyo Japan zero cases, closed two months last year. Mask compliance also 100%. Amazing coincidence.  argument? gym (primary class based) set classes everybody workout square stay in. wear masks enter leave keep warmup people entering room getting situated space. Additionally trainers grab weights outside workout space need additional weights. 

Once class starts though take mask work out. leave cube reason mask required again. Everything deep cleaned class working personal trainer free gym (not class based), masks required cant guarantee social distancing spaces. 

We dozens classes day hundreds members. positive covid test shut gym deep clean everything quarentine interacted infected person. 

We 3-4 positive cases first reopened nothing since *knock wood*

Masks important, situations mask required safe gym clean, covid-conscious gym *truly* maintaining social distancing.

Edit: posting disagree major way, posted wearing mask gym baffles wanted provide context find understandable still safe opinion (Germany) condition ""we need make vacation Mallorca meet new people bring home Covid maybe later talk testing return"". lived San Francisco back, I'm familiar SFGate decline last 15 years. days headline article fluff piece Disneyland. little advertisements op-eds disguised journalism, splash local news.

This epidemiologist interviewed article represent general consensus field, even article says much. feel-good nonsense, potentially dangerous too.

The UK, South Africa, Brazil, CA variants first discovered first roughly 50 million cases. closing 150 million cases, new infectious variants found NY elsewhere.

The wrong mix existing mutations patient could result far deadly vaccine-resistant variant, mutations even detected yet.

We might hit 150 million cases 1-year anniversary start lock-downs US, mid-March. certainly see multiple number cases time majority global population vaccinated. expect hit 300 million cases? 500 million? I’m Poland estimated shot date two years now. I’m really frustrated cannot see ever ending takes long vaccinate everyone. understand takes time two years?... also so, many people around refuse shot basically believe it’s ploy Bill Gates reduce human population. I’m losing hope tbh. let people die Canada vaccines can't produce, fund research development of, chose partner China instead US. Riveting argument. 


We lucky shared us. mean, restrictions place, stick arm! Maybe official numbers don’t reflect actual numbers? consider America league ""rich white western European nations"" like ""most planet""? idea vaccine production looks like, you? where!

Where vaccination drive happening?

Just curious. particular reason. referenced comparison end March 2020.

On March 31, 2021 1/3 many new cases yesterday.

The trend definitely right direction versus then, still three times many people getting infected per day then. Celebrate little victories, get it, need keep things perspective. like saying put fire kitchen ground floor skyscraper that's completely engulfed. pandemic roaring hell lot then. realize vaccinations light end tunnel, metrics daily cases, deaths hospitalizations higher today summer. eat mushrooms screened medical professionals. Swear God world would better place dramatic way.  Im sorry, don’t follow. You’re saying look people commenting understand confusion commented?

I also don’t think people’s frustrations explain people ready jump people advocating caution we’re 15% vaccination yet. Call reps, getting mad Reddit doesn’t anything. think lot people can't comprehend big numbers well. 500,000 might well 500,000,000. There's people think extinction level event. simpler time, happier time. 2019 one ever heard social distancing, word ""mandate"" seldom used heard, one could name public health official.

Many people bias fat/obese rationalizing bias lens ""choice"". obvious. Going right list tropes service profoundly shitty judgmental. 

Nevermind ""choice"" regard sometimes illusory, given many people certain genetic predispositions put weight eat addition stressors modern society pushing cortisol production which, again, promotes eating. things like active thyroid, Prader-Willi syndrome, Cushing Syndrome, etc etc. don’t know week I’ve seen things suggesting 2 weeks expected 75-90% range. don’t know I’d assume could extrapolate 1 week though. can’t really let vaccinated people whatever want vaccinated aren’t close herd immunity, do, non vaccinated people stuff lie vaccinated. still bad last summers peak, bad fuck, things getting better fast, still horrible time relax. Go another month without hug dinner, save many lives everyone this. 

Individually rational decisions collectively disastrous things like this. Thankfully much better masks easily cheaply available regular folks again. wear KF94 gym, assholes maskless there.

Also, time period shots AZ one? UK 12 weeks, looks result greater efficacy second shot initial 4 week time period. credible source claims? many healthcare workers even vaccinated peak January? bet death rate decrease quickly. Well, fewer identified cases affect number deaths. don’t think much concern. There’s people also skeptical mRNA opt JnJ traditional vaccine. JnJ also benefit one dose. people hearing scheduling second dose isn’t going smoothly people, single dose becomes lot attractive. people also picky would rather get jabbed soon possible.

IN March getting 50M Pfizer, 50M Moderna, 20M J&amp;J. enough 70M people. like 240 adults. That's 30% country get shots next month, theory! true though. things cant help capitalism

Instead attacking people can, go fucking organizations themselves.

The world get vaccines needs ***eventually.***

The point is, would Indians rather 100,000 vaccines 200,00 Biontech later 300,000 Biontech later (for example)?

It's net game, EU taking vaccines Indian arms right Q2. 

Also, got something back probably?

Anyway, asked source, there's plenty here's They’re also lot likely die covid. means worst case scenario avoided regards vaccines.

Well 50% Jnj nova almost nothing Astra that's SA stopped completely. rosy imo. mean, depends California. That's double pay teacher's salary Massachusetts aint cheap live here. think it’s valid mention country lockdowns mask mandates demonstrating minimal cases flu. article doesn’t compare countries different responses flu situation.

Edit: article cited doesn’t mention masks. Sweden never mask mandate minimal cases flu, I’m skeptical mask mandates driving decrease flu cases past year. idiot German ist Idiot.

Herd rsistance/immunity communities, seasonality, vaccination campaigns, NPIs, modified behavior, lack current gathering holidays, lower rates testing, etc. 

In reality, assume things varying degrees working together. more, less. contributing debate. probably varies location. Amazing one word it, I'd go infuriating though. time give weakness, need clear communication continued commitment want get shitshow pandemic. research much first shot Moderna protects COVID week? know two weeks around 80% Anti vaccination community? talking France? Look reply yours. People absolutely think going turn dime people vaccinated. Ya probably half died ripe old age 3 hours

This go one direction? consider worst living conditions possible best?

Only best. We're race bottom, we're race good position possible. That's everyone strive for: collective people treated well possible, much free time possible, producing much possible, sustaining environment much possible, treating eachother well possible. want compare Denmark nordic countries thats told spring 2020. swedes lot sub predicting glee nordic countries would see high death rates fall sweden would immune. 

I problem comparing sweden countries refuse say sweden well done much worse neighbours.  chicken waffles sweet potatoes apples mine, heriloom carrots snack. district really good food surprisingly. big. kids poverty line, enough people live district fund much least. year every kid gets meal free. tomorrow vaccinated brought us bagged lunches kids take home, plus kids get bookbag food due food insecurity. 

Now one schools 20 years old grows mold, windows back doors every classroom open. 70 years old, classroom walls temporary (for decades...), tiny rooms, windows open small bit. Right covid whole resolution literally upgrade tear every school district rebuild re-district others, one going torn rebuilt. covid happened plan wayside now. think approval too, ten year plan money enough start. Come on... sweat spread COVID. masks work, people spread 19 gym? Downvote shit want something ask yourself. friend lab researcher, posted new normal back banned, Im copying pasting response pcr tests. person responding hangs anti mask/lockdown forums btw.

Different covid tests look different parts sars-cov-2 genome, test specific enough amplify 3 shows cross Someone works stem cell research bad, FOREHEAD temperature scanners. mention

\-Those become symptomatic often contagious get fever, never get high fever.

Do think forehead scanners prevented spread? 4.8 positivity rate, 70k cases. terrible. Starting paragraph 2 starts goes mentioned link recent data suggests Novavax vaccine, achieved 95.6% efficacy previous SARS-CoV-2 strains 85.6% B.1.1.7 UK reduced efficacy 60% South Africa, 92.6% infections estimated Janssen single dose COVID-19 vaccine showed 72% efficacy preventing moderate severe disease, reduced 57% South recent report South Africa small sample size suggests substantial loss efficacy Oxford-Astrazeneca vaccine B.1.351 infection (**10.6%** efficacy mild-moderate disease).

Excuse soapbox bugs me. probably don’t need broadly shit one institutions designed keep businesses government honest. 

Good journalism matters. Rhetoric like keeps pushing death spiral started internet fucking killing business model. would want sign job? average terms deaths per capita

If believe reporting numbers last year. legitimate concern numbers massaged political purposes however. Need get vaccine work. 

We yet stupid risk fourth peak close. 

Especially pushing open schools, students vaccinated long time. 

Once vaccinated case count breathe easily worry imported cases like NZ Australia. regularly interacting people vaccinated

But that's OP said- two couples fully vaccinated, mom &amp; child, absolutely mix restrictions. tell american doctor post-residency makes easily 6 7 times Portuguese doctor makes. never met doctor (post residency) US worried paying student debt seems feel validated way thinking feeling. local gym (Crunch) decided ""vigorously exercising"" wear mask - thus, masks anyone inside building. Yeah every nursing home around us already outbreak months ago 70% got covid many died. shit declining. Little bit late. don’t want vaccinated people partying basically ending mask wearing social distancing norms. 

Having said that. Fuck noise. public health leaders bullshitting world since beginning, much rooted paternalistic lies don’t believe people listen follow advice honest. Sorry, democracy work. start lying, lose credibility pretty damn quickly. isn’t politicians lying. expect politicians lie, sorta accept another side vote don’t like job doing. public health establishment can’t expect people accept lies believe later. honest. need people buy masks, that, tell let wear home made masks. assumption jokers make people crisis unreasonable, yet examine people’s behavior well led war time, see civilians behaved Blitz, don’t need lie keep people line, need honest. love Daily also....probably one best podcasts ever, Barbaro LIVES doom. Hopefully hear stories near future positive trends look. meantime, fully expect stories variants, reinfections, long COVID, lack vaccinations kids, vaccine hesitancy, etc. mean mask culture, also share food culture. got flu way often Asia Europe. friends posting photos spin class - literally 250 square foot room low ceilings 20 people breathing heavily it. large gym high ceilings decently spaced equipment, feel like huge risk, classes seem crazy me.  Maybe they'll OK J&amp;J Novavax? That's simply true. Even measures overwhelmed hospitals turn patients send states peaks US. worst-hit countries even worse, example Ecuador peak, bodies left rot streets weeks morgues overwhelmed. New York 7-8 times many deaths normal worst week, imagine death toll would whole city completely lock down? sure downvoted. Seatbelts dehumanizing, they?

What I'm trying ask could better encouraged population masks indeed dehumanizing. would trouble it’s worth? anticipating national riot anti vaxxers lol? keep claiming it’s bad thing try force people something don’t want haven’t provided reasons case said it’s argument. Sometimes need take collective action enforce basic societal standards. don’t think government enforce case problem companies enforcing protect workers. don’t use sheer power corporations lives good instead continuing drive wages fuck average worker. coronavirus reinfection, sure something else. Bottom line, doomed! Doomed, say! please click ads buy subscription.  Except states seeing massive surges now. So..... reasonable keep schools closed extended periods time.

I disagree certain states could opened. NY beginning fall opened community spread like 1% less. nuance arguments work, usually nothing approach governments involved.

Texas example open forever since beginning despite opening well north 10% spread. Texas sure absolutely battered hospitalizations (summer, drop beginning fall, huge spike cases around November weeks ago). best thing Biden administration could ask Fauci take break TV month two let vaccinations ramp up. messaging vaccinations aren’t solving anything isn’t helping media keep asking Fauci questions reporting every statement he’s making like it’s scripture. news saw morning insanely rapid decline nursing home deaths says plenty vaccines get us to. Deaths metric important opening up. hospital load. Even strictest lockdown fanatics can't convince people stay locked deaths hospitals handle it.  Ugh, hijab example inaccurate. religious clothing that's part cultural tradition respect; that's believe that's human rights issue. 

But masks different. need wear public health safety reasons. Without mask mandates, would much worse position now. states relaxing mask mandates wrong. trying say actually ... seximated?

I find way out, mind me! winter spike one measures governor took making masks mandatory outdoors. Yet sit maskless restaurant 90 minutes. 

I'm denying masks help science thrown window long time ago regards masks. amount demonstrating massive gap understanding virology and/or vaccines?

If vaccines massively reduce ability spread virus, would huge upset understanding virology immunology. Like, maaaaaaaasive changes would needed. take COVID 100% serious wear mask everywhere go. I’m gym rat works home lives alone. excited hear gyms opening back up.

But got realized one wearing mask respecting 6-foot radius. employees, including managers treated like big joke would shame gym-goers would insist getting temperature checked. sanitation gym somehow become worse pre-COVID. 

I still occasionally go lift off-hours like 11 9:30 night. don’t cardio indoors cuts gym time significantly. think pandemic may improving West, articles Finland, Czechia, France, Germany, etc shutdowns.

Is B117 variant shut prime minster said state pandemic Finland worsened since Christmas, due part spread highly-infectious British variant three-quarters confirmed cases Finland thought British strain tools previously available us longer enough control situation,"" Marin seriousness situation, prime minister also announced three-week closure pubs, bars restaurants take place 8-28 March. Maybe violation health guidelines? said lax mask rules...  thing is, think number people iffy mRNA vaccines shrinking rapidly. given number new cases plummeting. People see want jump bandwagon. Even wife seriously considering getting shot unequivocally said wants asked recently. So? yet, replies writer elsewhere story shared all, ""HERE GO AGAIN!"" ""Why opening things, then?"" Hijabs legally required majority Muslim countries 40-60 years ago so. mom kid, women would wear miniskirts modern fashions go head uncovered without concern. Things swiftly suddenly changed. Women always oppressed Middle East, mandatory hijabs relatively modern phenomenon. places (or least ones aware of), generally personal choice 40-60 years ago.  vaccine end game. Period. nothing past “vaccine”. want keep restrictions place scary variants, vaccine might work 100%, etc., etc., you’ll forever. There’s *always* going scary variant (or even completely different disease!) lurking around corner endemic virus. 

This there’s social end pandemic. It’ll probably never scientifically go away, society eventually gives lives it. Trying force scientific restrictions forever onto society completely unrealistic, broadcasting constant worst-case scenarios fear harm good. gym, along gyms state, require masks Tell Chuck Norris... Lol yeah sure buddy. entire class people power wealth hoarding accruing political capital destroy regulations using predatory business practices beat average worker. it’s fault want safe workplace I’ve forced go everyday since thing started people get sick regular basis work with. know what? felt much better there.

But greater risk, violation health guidelines.  Yeah I'm sure gyms closed, I'm arguing closure, though see pictures people wearing masks gym sure.

I like comparison behavior risk catching covid risky behavior endanger people. risk one spread others lost comparison. That's I'm saying. gyms stay closed, comparison bungee jumping flawed.

Probably hard screen easier go age work id. far places. bit longer social public. space house go it.  There's minor uptick past days, overall trends still going downwards. small jumps normal expected, see spike like anything realm holidays/January would really improbable. combination warmer weather, natural immunity (for better worse), vaccine rollout going continue suppressing big spikes due variants keep curve steadily declining. worst could plateau weeks variant spread outpaces inoculations. already vaccination cards/health booklet, including international vaccination cards.

Why extra paper ? That's percentages work. makes sense... Based comments thread, we're almost year thing people still can't seem grasp choices necessarily effect them.

It makes sense people used relying others safety (and vice versa) would able understand wearing mask important you, people around every person either may come contact with. Increasing evidence emerging **vaccinations prevent significantly reduce transmission**. data that's *good enough* scientists 100% sure moment. doctors scientists wonderful advisors good policy makers. government needs weigh scientists advice certain risk order shape policy. Doctors deal risk. zero sum game them. No, ""years data"" rarely required getting full approval. Ongoing safety monitoring done tandem approval shorter trial period. instance, Pfizer file full approval COVID vaccine April. I’m sure think true. Many people didn’t get infected despite horrible numbers. everyone got infected. define that? except I’ve gotten first Moderna shot. I’m approximately 4 weeks going back gym fucking year! remember telling gym acquaintances would see 3 4 weeks got COVID control lol!! short term errors numbers, 75% decline daily infections peak early January real. states earlier peaks already 90+%.

Specifically, ever since late January. True, thank you. pisses ""British"" ""Kent"" variant, started become sequenced continent, found already pretty much every country already. Britain world leader, Belgium South Africa, genome sequencing many years, hence 3 countries found new variants.

The modern Europeans blindsided vision Trump:

""Can't find new variants genome sequencing country"" Lol get downvoted making relevant point. Jeez. TIL races Black Asian. think so. think idea people can't cough sneeze eyes. might also remind rub eyes, contact lenses might actually encourage rubbing.

But read article. evidence Hong Kong beginning, back March 2020. interesting see actual study now. strange. think charitable interpretation what's happening SA variant took attention away Brazilian one first one heavily covered media.

One piece good news, however: even though Brazilian variant around 2-3 months, surge cases outside Manaus. rest Brazil fairly stable. 17.3% American adults Great. It’s bit choosy beggar situation, one reads foolish comments sub daily. Gwyneth goddamn Paltrow usual self. way China proactive Uyghur population?.. Never mind us working fathers guess huh? 🙄 think you’ve forgotten billions around world third world countries likely never vaccinated, take many many years Colorado seems amazing job roll out.

I assure you, is. He’s gonna gone soon go first think goes show vaccine/immunity dependent ending pandemic mean? BioNTech supposed start clinical trials one year.   r/IAmVeryBadAss I'm guessing way things US headed upcoming summer. People wear masks shops &amp; maybe keep away large crowds otherwise behaviour shift closer pre-COVID norms. Oh ok saw two times year well thought that's really excessive lol UK data indicates 30% deadly. could linked fact average corvid lasts 10 days variant lasts 13, immune system bit extra time damage body. also possibly spreads usual isolation 10 days.

As proportion variants, generally grows 60% week. 10% one week, 16% next, etc. still worry possible surge. things already better (frontline healthcare workers longer risk longer quarantine unless visibly sick) get better longer takes surge manifest It’s important note isn’t new vaccine order, it’s merely confirming Moderna going meet previous contractual obligations, weeks concern trolling Canadian blogosphere. It’ll interesting see boogieman seized next vaccine contracts pan fine. bring going Toronto? seems like looking excuses keep things closed, despite improving metrics. guess would full time masks. might get taken 2 days old -- possible re-post. missed myself. important! study shows glasses around half effective mask ventilation. contact lenses? ""Two clusters involved probable educator-to-educator transmission followed educator-to-student transmission classrooms resulted approximately one half (15 31) school-associated cases.""

Here's take-away, even best laid plans school re-opening totally ruined relaxation rules, level. 

So school 6ft spacing, plexiglass dividers, staggered hybrid classes, mandatory masks times classroom, rapid ubiquitous testing, hygiene theater world... great. undone two teachers going faculty lounge, taking masks eat lunch, like: ""Susan, watch American Idol last night?? Ahahahah trip! OMG let tell spouse went dinner last night! Oh well look time, back work covid mines... \*dons mask, walks back classroom\*"" original statement schools closed nothing harm children. That's false statement. know closing schools helped drive R significantly cost education.

Anyway Stop! get excited. back half year going intense. company last year said summer vaccine available, CEO said never require everyone come back office even vaccine. imagine might go hybrid model nothing discussed months I’m sure.

I miss coworkers office camaraderie too. Thanks Magic! may do, that's point i'm making. saying school dangerous children, despite groundless fears article trying stoke.

The aim minimise cases expense everything else. keeping manageable. Closing schools severe costs harms children. actual knowledge regarding this, form understand mutation concerning SA variant mutation concerning Brazilian variant, think would reasonable assume would least pretty effective. Would nice know concretely though. Bro, I’m saying you’d get $1,000 competitive street prices, that’s way it’ll workish. Well, one thing, cases would actually decline week. far they're rising bit.

I know, know, \*definitely\* snowstorm catchup plateau. B117 spike, would look like first. Makes sense, 100 days masks, curfews lockdowns, recommended. Every time I've gym recently, rhymes Flanet Pitness, 80% schnoz sticking masks, next 15% stupid shit like talking phone mask treadmill bike. staff scared confront morons. think likely climate tbh. Northern states lax approaches much higher death rates. Although Alabama Mississippi also among highest death rates think they're pretty similar climate approach Florida. lot variables. Alabama Mississippi also much poorer unhealthier Florida. got quickly forgotten reason even locked first place prevent hospitals overwhelmed. it. eradicate covid, literally one dies it. reason ever thought acceptable first place prevent healthcare apocalypse. fear thing though, 2020 really showed fucked government really care people, money man, everyone race first one develop vaccine cut many damn corners, trust it, again, guys that's fine, family taking it, followed cdc guidelines, wear mask everywhere go, stopped seeing family. far caught virus even resulted quitting job nursing home surge 214 cases Covid-19 left bring virus home. I'm trying protect man. I'll damned we've careful avoid take vaccine might give us side effects worse COVID years later would say that? worked school offered summer school every summer. Tons do. Sure, see edit. really could explained talking better.  ""Quiet rage. Boredom anger"" perfect way describe this. I'm exact boat you, except Canada. :( Eh, getting shingles transformed risk analysis chicken pox. I’m grateful vaccine thought unnecessary available kids. 

Let’s romanticize past either. I’d look deaths measles insignificant number prior vaccination - millions yearly. 

Plus, wants horribly ill weeks trash immune system months afterward? don’t think benign. one know I’ve talked remembers anything miserable.

And everyone know who’s real flu never missed flu shot since - wiped weeks! Thanks! think happen. think we'd choose reopen point, sadly, even situation arise. hope good cross immunity, though, hope we'll able rapidly deploy good vaccines every year eradicate fast-tracked mRNA vaccines like Moderna/Pfizer vaccines. Problem. girlfriend got first shot went kinds paperwork prove comorbs ask single thing.

Took ID insurance card that. said person administering asked essential worker actual clue met criteria.

I think right idea. Talk management, check local guidelines, book appointment appropriate. worry denied. Seems basically jabing anyone gets appointment.

Without meaningful analysis generational structural influences terms power, wealth, neo-imperialism, etc, term ""advanced"" becomes another American Exceptionalist term.  could doubt approval denied wasted money shipping doubt J&amp;J want lose money avoid it.

Reactive Arthritis happen viral infections generally speaking go away cases. get script NSAIDs bad enough want add daily drug manage pain. think it'll run course. think likely (and reasonable) outcome everyone gotten vaccine wants one, re-open everything. anti-vaxxers get covid, problem.

Unless there's data leads life altering affects, I'm going conspire it. Trials going almost year point. affects now, doubt ever be. False positive. silence surrounding variant worries more. wasn’t assumption, logical deduction based available evidence. Possibly multiple, especially variants keep popping up.

There could also worse virus. Fortunately, covid poses extremely little risk kids (less flu). So, need worry kids getting covid adults interact vaccinated. sure hope so. really make much sense report doses one dose two dose vaccines someone one dose fully vaccinated. opinion make difference terms efficacy vaccine,” said Raul Andino, UCSF virologist led variant antibody research. “I would say nothing afraid now.”   words, antibodies two four times weaker \[California\] variant. Similar studies looking variant South Africa found antibodies six 10 times weaker.  California variant cause concern, “but certainly like South Africa,” said Jay Levy, infectious disease expert UCSF said found results released week reassuring. “The vaccines work, unless mutates become worse. You’re still neutralizing virus.”   key takeaway remains: Everyone get vaccinated turn comes, said Bali Pulendran, professor microbiology immunology Stanford.  asked me, ‘would take vaccine hope might offer protection variants?’” said. “My answer would resounding yes.”

We're going keep getting news stories like this, possibly indefinitely. think important focus interpreting reasonably let sensationalism (or unbridled optimism) take narrative. @flu vaccine efficacy, made advance actual flu season made using predictions influenza strains circulating around. believe influenza mutates much higher rate SARS-Cov-2 well. said, amazing COVID-19 vaccine effective especially quickly developed. comparing seasonal flu covid vaccine efficacy fair.

However, also extremely difficult infected 2 respiratory viruses once. point almost impossible. We've seen pattern past flus pandemics. Coronavirus dominant virus, naturally suppressing flu. Grounds termination cause ask me. benefits, severance... door.

Just need fill position letting go. tracking rabbit hole links gives source 10% ""symptoms 3 weeks."" symptoms months seems less common. Perhaps find graph linked reassuring.

Long covid certainly thing, get wrong. think may overestimating common is. Looks like might starting see super bowl bump. Fortunately looks like resulted cases leveling little bit instead dropping like past weeks. aren’t there. gonna know? Apologies incorrect terminology severe referring hospitalisations deaths. I'm mistaken still expected they'll provide good protection due layers immunity e.g. T-cell. got second shot January I'm wearing masks lot places simply stand out. people know I'm vaccinated, mask is. can't wait done shit. doctor legit told go hospital unless incapable breathing went wouldn’t let forever could die. horrifying. sick almighty hell 2.5 months. Rly scary time city, sure people weren’t living rly understand it. Bad info everywhere, Spain Italy ravaged news, fears triage. Truly wild. put “Bang” back Bangladesh! I'd call South Korea Greece worse getting beside point.

Your analogy apt, considering *all* United States considering *all* countries. 

I think better analogy, let's use Olympic running race analogy comparing countries.

Let's say ~200 world's countries run race Sweden takes 1st place, America takes 2nd, Japan takes 3rd.

This would like saying ""America second slowest medalist world"". Like yeah, that's true, kind weird way refer literally second fastest planet right?

That's feel say ""America almost worst first world nation"". Like yeah guess could phrase way seems biased misleading. Even first world nation already really high bar - like Olympic medalist is.

I guess feel like people often twist words carefully craft sentences technically correct conveying ideas biased way. 

I mean call Olympic 3rd place medalist slow runner, even though they're slowest medalist. many people call America shitty country account ""worst"" first world nation?

My answer think they're biased Bravo. Actually, one problems Germany socialized medicine classical sense. form socialized health insurance held 85% people, split different providers providers charge vaccination process – states are. idea whole process organized lists names coming – probably official registered address lists held town hall, I'm 100% sure this. One friend mine vaccinated (AZ) working vaccination center, guess got called up. What's going Manaus, Brazil scares shit me. also many mutations developed done parallel way. 

It really depends virus does. keeps surprising many epidemiologists experts, I'm sitting cautiously optimistic vaccine rollout. flu undergo reassortment massively changes genetics makes volatile mutate something deadly, covid far undergoes standard mutations.  What’s wrong word “ubiquity?” It’s advanced word. Uh, there's 3 waves we're getting third? stupidest thing I've ever read tested too, look much better. real world tests, writing wall. quarantining suspect Covid-19... could good. Whatever brings significant ventilation. actually think “ubiquity” advanced vocabulary word? extent, care, public policy shaped around afraid, shuns person share fear, life things used enjoy held hostage judgemental people call people selfish wanting live normal life. look results Moderna’s clinical trial, there’s graph shows total covid cases vaccine group vs placebo group. day 10 first dose, lines start diverge (placebo group keeps going up, vaccine group flattens significantly). assume least protection 10-14 days, week, would act behave like zero protection. decides line high risk condition acceptable risk condition? Someone always gets fucked people always complain matter what. Thats focus keeping things streamlined fast. happened general public able get vaccinated summer? mean, course yes okay. high risk population chance get vaccinated yet we're still lockdown... ""HMMMMMMMM."" 
- Michael Barbaro saw today there's certain states allowing High Schools actually let kids participate SPORTS pandemic? realized actually case, knew certain states allowed schools open assumed one taking far. goes show people can't get past Tribalism even second there's millions upon millions people lives danger worldwide. Leadership failing America even still. Vaccination like testing, except easier need maximum two times.  convince anti-vac. I'm still worried get 90+% vaccination US. guess get around 70% that's big win. amazing ~~election~~ injection do. studies don’t show vaccine useless, less effective. Agree. Fauci politician. He's doctor scientist. Oh fucks sake. know many viruses we’ve officially eradicated earth? 2. It’s perfectly acceptable word. safer option? fuckary US gov. could vaccines sooner. big difference shipping Belgium compared Kalamazoo

Also negatively impacts European nations Belgium facility supposed support Canada

It's reason few, one Actually, vaccines fully prevent severe disease even current variant. clinical studies small sample judge, [the first real world results (sample 1M+), found 87% protection hospitalization 7 days second dose Pfizer/BioNTech. Pretty high, it'll probably significantly lower new variants. started badmouthing bacon. hate him. want it, high risk can’t get yet cause age. neighbor danger.

Opinions change daily. data vaccinations rolling really know. goats got eat. didnt. I'm talking right second. thing news doom gloom. summer, everyone wants vaccine access it. set people protected ever going covid. Yet answer still masks distancing want chance become potential serial killer. planet make sense?

Infection risk isn’t personal level protection, also depends prevalence disease community well. no, they’re “as protected they’ll ever be” prevalence community goes down, they’ll protected. Muzzled? Fauci every talk news show last year. don’t buy stating facts. take ""talking down"". FYI anything privilege. Go look definition ""privilege"". 

Yes think people pushing go back power lifting gym pandemic self absorbed. Everyone making sacrifices feel like personal conveniences luxuries important.

I active gym goer pre-covid. Went every day least day. many years. telling ME, active gym goer, can't work without gym? That's pretty funny. Nobody said ""the same"". think anything right ""the same"" pre-covid? Anything? guess even though everyone else making sacrifices, entitled so. 

You naive. think health ability work given. not. lot people deal difficult injuries, even permanent life long ones. Every news outlet world makes money based advertisements. get ad dollars based many clicks headlines get. 

They also know click something makes ANGRY click anything else. Next, click something SCARES you. 

You click something makes ANGRY SCARED click something makes happy, hungry, nostalgic, optimistic, thoughtful. 

So don’t surprised see scary, rage-inducing Covid-19 headlines. 

Just keep you’re doing, trust data. disagree. think people also hesitant sometimes bc many people think unreasonable position change time. feel like still people say well can't trust Fauci originally said wear mask. age sound bites lack nuance (or critical thinking?) dealing broad amounts people, literally entire country, need careful wording especially important makes people hesitate risk statements misconstrued later point. I’m counseling intern homeless shelter work mostly kids (ages 3-12) classroom settings, small groups, individuals. also live Florida. So... exposure opportunities. I’m pretty good masking. double mask. I’m less good washing hands often probably (more like every 30-60 minutes individual client rather time touched surface). ate lunch car. I’d take sips water, always decent distance six feet. 

I’m also really experiencing respiratory symptoms symptoms annoying, minor. feel like mild sinus infection. 

I went dinner friend night symptom onset. eat outside. wore mask food arrived put back done eating meal. since tested negative experiencing symptoms. also live mother keep distant job. rapid test negative she’s waiting PCR results. symptoms. 

I still think proper best practices excellent mitigation strategy. close contact people since tested negative let’s hope holds up. 

I’m annoyed really close getting vaccinated. knew took placement increased risk, vaccines approved told already contact county vaccine event staff residents. took time, scheduled today. also don’t really regret it. Mental healthcare priority. took precautions wasn’t enough. sit vaccinated reasons. First, CDC recommendations wait 90 days. Idk that’s immune response supply issues (I assume latter). Second, missed opportunity vaccinate job need wait state open vaccines age category. It’s extremely annoying.

I way suggest particular headline clickbait. 

Many headlines are, however. said accurate.

Please read specific comment replying to. Big Brown Toy Truck going drop pain virus. Tip hat ! Hi Canada. We’re currently lagging Moderna Pfizer shipments drastically reduced weeks now. Nothing screwup, ordered lots ordered advance, everyone go EU plants facing limited supply (and frankly considered priority terms international clout; it’s disappointing EU disappointing Canada, they’ll disappoint us). Shipments increasing, thankfully. haven’t approved AZ yet. see way I. Question lie then? Honestly retired NYS healthcare employee 31 yrs life long NYer hope arrogant asshole/sexual predator gets boot goes flames. He's POS. I’m actually opposite end cart. I’ve asked friends come see vaccine, matter herd immunity reached not. I’m high risk cannot risk getting virus way. getting it’s available me. It’s building strong resentment. shut economy.

Disney World closed 4 months state practically closed March June last year.  And, kind messaging, like not, gives fuel conspiracy theorists stop pushing pandemic restrictions government control whatnot. That's awesome, thank info. Oh really?

**Population:** 
Florida: 21.8 million 
California: 39.5 million

**COVID Deaths:** 
Florida: 30,339 
California: 50,935 I’m really sick stay home. I’m coughing slightly I’m putting mask That's happened FL last spring. great winter (because FL people outside), DeSantis lifted restrictions last Spring. hot, people came indoors, Covid exploded. 

But time, 12% vaccinated (plus least many people virus) baseline getting vaccinated everyday. think we're going back were, nobody Trumpist Governor saying that. he's going get ""win."" That's excess caution also do. Regarding rankings feel them, bring related relatable entry.

According site[1], New Mexico ranked 49th 50 states education. New Mexico's response ""man, least we're Alabama (50th place)""?

Just Japan may worse protections United States means little overall point, except used terminal term ""worst"", fact we're second-to-last place, close enough bottom makes difference.


[1] Yes thst didnt occur blood would become thick sludge youd die. let’s say recommend draconian lockdowns restrictions actual policy combat flu future. Furthermore, let’s ditch masks reduce flu talking point Sweden also mask mandate yet decrease cases flu. There’s always going residual risk. Always. us aren’t willing wait zero risk start living. colleges this?

If college going mostly virtual fall, prospective students enroll different colleges current students transfer take gap years. Virtual education even close worth cost. Someone correct I’m wrong, still don’t know vaccinated individuals carry pass COVID vaccinated, likely people still socially distancing. Widespread vaccination could change however. Yeah, that’s I’ve virtually given trying reason people. remember last week started retrieving data influenza cases 2020-2021, try show what’s going on, eventually realized futile exercise. amount evidence going persuade people. Well known among Black Americans, make difference there. Trying bury makes look shadier. ones? 400 since vaccine became available mid December.

That's 400 less 3 months, whole pandemic you’re vaccinated, there’s reason care, least yourself. Right now, vast majority people unvaccinated, care providing people opportunity break rules. Yeah social distancing pandemic losers. Lets go superbowl parrty bar. People underestimate much Louisville Memphis affect rest country. Yea chat IRC Discord. helps get social needs met stuff. Sorry internet safety teachers i'm chatting online. 16 year-old ""even aware need studying"", they're going make college anyway. stay basement, wont missed. Israel three metrics fell around middle January, 70% elderly gotten least 1 shot point. hope get banned community spreading complete lies garbage. Terrible. Disgusting. 

The reason 500k+ people United States died literally people like bullshit rhetoric. go pat back ol' ""we want Asian efficiency without uhhh efficient"" problem strikes again. Today February... like others natural antibodies probably work also vaccine probably work. I'm even going click link give ""journalists"" click anymore. We’re still going “poor life choices”? 

I thought society caught science this. whole moralizing thing. Depression, anxiety, addiction, obesity, accurately described *choices*.  virus enemy. humans. Good thing you! older people getting vaccinated massively lowering risk serious infection . ever tried getting gym contract? Thank you! this. Hoping get lucky! Opening windows works (of course top wearing masks keeping physical distance). That’s school since September. Even it’s 25 degrees outside, crack least one window every classroom hallway wear jackets cold. better flu shot! flu shots 20-30% effective I'm vaccinated care unvaccinated Karens stop wearing masks around me. simply care, health gonna protected. 

Why care again? EVERYTHING risks. Even driving car work could end someone getting killed. vaccinations increase well natural immunity soon come time latter overtakes former again.

Also pandemic downplayed also upplayed others. freaking black death. frankly completely isolating gone caution paranoia remember sub said “long covid” myth NZ lock family got sick laundry airplane. type small outbreak trigger instant lockdown. don’t find terrific wouldn’t want live life looking shoulder day waiting next outbreak pop up.

At least USA vaccinations places start open soon.    Hi EU.

Canadá here. 

We’ll use please.  wrong, disingenuous. pouting CDC say ""once get vaccine burn mask go breathe stranger's face"".

We're headed right direction, chill bit, stop trying make CDC ""the bad guy"" global fucking pandemic. That's remember. changed pizza looked appetizing, tasted like cardboard.  I'm sure would possible,. vaccination like ""wearing condom"". (it's magical-barrier prophylactic).

Not matter good immune system ""primed"" fight something, still takes bit time react (it's organic system, all). Maybe hours day more. lot depends much ""viral load"" got exposed to. 

Immune strength may vary person person (depending medical history). 

Immunity may also decline time. 

So there's lot variables there. one situations assume possible. act/behave like contagious,. protect (and others) accordingly. 

* assume contagious.. end wrong (you're actually contagious).. winner,. nothing bad happens. 

* assume CAN'T pass on.. wrong.. could deadly wrong. 

So better go 1st strategy 2nd. Netherlands snow storm disrupted distribution doses, big reason slow down. States cancel lot first dose appointments running vaccines. practically deliveries last week. feel like damn drop really plateauing Florida makes nervous fuck.

Having serious medical issues nothing way. thrown way get sympathy issue hand GYM. us either know people serious health issues. really unique situation. 

I even know bringing cancer survivor conversation. comments actually make sense. proving points. literally throwing around random words phrases pretty funny.

You actually idea talking about. Parents struggling HARD right fact oblivious reflects low IQ stupidity. 

Back point hand: work without gym. End story. gyms lead higher spread covid. Nobody said ok miss going gym, accept two facts:

1) NEED gym work 
2) Gyms risky dangerous terms covid spread, outlined CDC

All nonsense ramblings take away facts. call privileged 0 evidence back up. fact, I'm fellow gym goer sit whine complain like makes hell lot less privileged you. ""pity"" throw around random words. Pretty funny. Oh, assume ""stay inside"" day. 

You clueless gets. 

To re-iterate HUNDREDTH time: work without gym. gym given. People survived hundreds years without it. huge percentage population can't afford go gym kids therefore can't make gym. still work out. Without gym. can't wait kids LOL.... wait. Would love hear cry complain kids stole away rights much hate let go gym. anything, *maybe* we'll need regular booster shots.

Bars, weddings, etc resuming eventually (or resumed already depending live) It’s like government need communicate chart messaging tailored different audiences

As right now, someone could say ""we wear masks even cases 6 months sports, etc. etc."" truth is? They're necessarily wrong ZERO metric published shown known think moving forward. 

I personally mind masks mind social distancing, hopeless/helpless think definitely feel. Plenty spare Europe idiots Trump's still president, he's Biden's puppet master. wanted lose election. response would probably dumbell enough something stupid like hahaha Vaccines likely permanently us, socialization near 100% summer people either vaccinated willing accept risk.

The fake vaccinated dangerous drop masks distancing infect take disease others. course, restrictions anyway, conversely, actually vaccinated would allowed meet up, too. Lots local nurses (Texas) turning vaccine. Oh CDC, get rid mold too? -schools Optics. definitely seems political anti AZ media there. scaremongering isn’t helping anyone anything slowing vaccinating people.

Many people terrified needles keep getting vaccinated, really hope that's worked on, especially one time vaccine.. Also mRNA viruses mostly used different virus carrier new protein messaging want introduce. course already immunity carrier virus made difficult create virus body doesn’t destroy it’s job 

The downside using another virus carrier makes vaccine stable. mRNA viruses kept low temperatures Last March Italy got fucked up. blame cautious. go LA Fitness tell 50% people wear masks wear correctly.

My gra Omg effing horrifying  Health officials cautious. Back March 2020, Dr. Fauci said vaccine  going arrive Summer 2021.  Yep. one funny things Hospital (course March-April 2020, pretty early pandemic),.. Doctors saying “Well, we’re planning X-Y-Z procedure you,.. theres still lot Covid dont know”.

At time probably true,.. feeling still (not high degree, still)

The thing is,.. many variables. Genetics. Blood type. Medical history. Past habits (smoking, etc) 

Doctors never figure situation got severe. suspect cytokine storm (immune system reaction). why?... somehow “to healthy” ? (I dont ever get yearly flu shots). I’m also Blood type A+ seems worst reactions (compared blood types)

It boggles mind people dismissive careless. lack self preservation (they’re playing Russian roulette w/ life),.. also lives others.  hate tech workers enough power companies know need treat well? Sure, they're working home, saying use extra vacation days, nothing else use personal day destress care yourself? doctor told oxygen dipped 90% go ER otherwise ride home. basically described girlfriend gone eat since March (or go nearly anywhere) got 2nd shot (she 1a) went everything odd. readjusted eating started good time. Every time go back gym issue. I'm sticking outdoor variant workout plan I'm vaccinated. Maybe later, since stupid half measures like chin masking piss things. they’re smart they’ll like NJ base honor system. system like NY requires documentation adds logistical challenges sites like time constraints. importantly totally fucks people vaccine hesitant (or willing work it), poor people may see physicians regularly one long time, vulnerable/older populations going run challenges getting medical documentation. people going abuse system? Yes almost certainly. alternative make system stringent slows everything down. Every person cuts line end day contributing herd immunity less slow system stop vulnerable/old/poor populations vaccine access adding hurdles process. good advice. unfortunately, don’t know interacting face face job. 

Plus, extroverts introverts different need social interaction. (More spectrum simplicity’s sake let’s call 2 categories.) types need social interaction, introvert prefers social interaction close group familiar people, satisfied pre planned self limited interactions, extroverts need social *stimulation*. means interacting many different people, naturally spontaneously. Pre planned zoom meetings may really cut it. 

I’m extrovert. Well, there’s way could force everyone go anyways. Even places talking making optional. laws many days minutes kids go school, can’t suddenly change little notice. parents don’t take advantage summer school, honest. People vacations planned, since many people cancelled things last year. 

I don’t think teachers would issue. always signed needed last school. Plenty teachers need extra cash. Wasn’t 85% 28 days 100% 49 days shot? one guy gym cut slit mask. Every time sister sees it, tattles him. put fresh mask on. comparison, believe effective vaccine prior Covid vaccines around 83%. flu vaccine low 30% good year around 60%. vaccines clocking around 95%

Not expert, I'm pretty sure vaccines even effective. E.g. herd immunity measles would even work vaccine efficacy 83% due incredibly high R0. Shoot up!! 💉 wear mask public considered essential, many people rely normalcy mental health stability.

Or know, get it, find alternative normalcy accept things go planned year two. Weeks “concern trolling” happened coincide weeks dramatically reduced cancelled shipments.

Wish trial data situations like world wide standard would need add branch study example Native Americans people Asian descent population represented countries' studies. tell follow vaccine appointments fairly religiously NJ I’ve getting appointments family/friends getting probably 1-3 appointments per day average weekend almost nothing released several sites NJ (especially smaller ones) rescheduled Monday Tuesday due shipments Moderna. asked bigger sites use reserve second shots immediately fulfill first dose appointments almost mid size smaller locations shut 3-4 days terms booking new appointments. past two days things started open back normal. corresponds exactly national trend suspect similar things happened speak NJ Thanks recommendation.  list. every single kid school forced go,you'd need WAY usual teachers willing teach summer.  really know rural America, you? Tons people access reliable internet. Heck, driving Kansas interstate spots slow internet cell service.

I'm wondering do. family lives rural places. quick average family members come 30 people per square mile townships. lower actually live since residents right main road drive average up. guess what, single family member internet least times week. chances elderly person internet, none children internet, none grandchildren internet, none friends internet, doctor would ask basically 0. rural little contact others know anyone internet, they're rally priority I'll give bigger companies capacity UI maintaining databases, government accept bids companies would want privatization route give everyone fair chance

that worked real well 'bama-care website /s. reality few, any, companies data mining analytics capability google, apple, amazon. sure, could bid it, bid intelligently, companies would win they've mining data decades people. likely already know age peoples' grandparents whether prefer pepsi coke. Like said. Dummkopfs. Take upvote get out. Applause public give them. Carrot stick. Carrot first becomes ineffective. eventually need stick. We’re going hit point amount data actually going convince people covid vaccine safe can’t basic risk assessment reasonable way. point thing push towards consequences. schools mandate vaccines far less deadly widespread diseases. Partying always looked upon introverts reddit. Imagine embarrassing take. around 50% america remote right now, dont know almost anyone working person. dont even know vaccines stop transmission, people arent willing go in, sure cant understand that. small % teachers cant ""go back"" cant run school half workforce, hate people like try dictate schools would inking run things. Yet espouse reddit like youre fucking expert. problem probably unions right? Fuck teachers living good life rights, dont jealous.  That's $2 pound dude, pair 60s. 120. Still ridiculous. Could alcohol ban kill alcoholics alcoholics kill spreading virus go non essential store buy said DRUG? Unfortunately still fogs glasses, probably weird shaped nose lmao Work gym surprised. enforce mask policy mouth nose.  call ""time go make friends."" Since mask check every 20 minutes. 

The amount shit conspiracy bullshit deal crazy. people threaten physical violence legal. Coworkers almost got hit car someone kicked out. call police escort others out. 

Also anyone interested say people claim ""but rights."" Tell look 10th amendment plus 1905 Supreme Court case Jacobson V Massachusetts.  Also court case held 2020. search every drug company world find sort negligence controversy. two examples: understand concern regarding lack phase 3 data. think published efficacy rates. Grocery store trips relatively safe depending are. Everyone masked sweat induced desire remove mask. You’re generally staying long you’re staying next anyone long. bottle 5 minutes less, you’re gym. 

The equivalent maybe buying weights working home. That’s safe would unfair compare gyms. havnt kept asthma still one, believe one point least. guy terrible governor handled covid response well find really strange UK it’s mandatory wear mask whilst working out. received email (maybe last September?) forced close again, telling us wear mask entry could take off. 

As far I’m aware, transmission rates gyms incredibly low, I’m surprised at. know gym go around constantly cleaning machines equipment, can’t imagine gyms that? think talk variants connected countries damaging. thought learnt calling ""Spanish flu"".

Covid insanely infectious chance SA variant far SA picked up. could've started nation.

But SA paying heavy price additional strict isolation scientists structures identify, study report new strain.

Covid also spreading seemingly randomly, spiking wrong seasons ignoring lockdowns often cases decline rapidly without us really understanding why. know well enough say great certainty strains spread cause damage etc. IMO. is, make even effective. Everything said normal. Standard. obviously privileged know hardship is. reality alternatives gym, lot people can't work various reasons time (even pre-covid), people get injuries, etc. 

But guess people realize privileged something happens thats challenging work home without gym temporarily seem bad all. I've hell lot worse, guess people haven't. probably worst thing ever happened them. Sigh. Ok take bait....

None said makes sense, backed factual data/figure. noticed Zero Covid goal? Amazon Walmart rule world apparently essential, small business owners aka heart economy pissed on, laughed shamed.

By whom? Yeah, unabomber personas Reddit rather watch lockdowns kill world economy accepting wrong.

They give fuck social contact essential mental health, why? friends can't relate, simple that.

You need 20 years psychology analyze people.  True coworkers too, although felt fine. lot pain anticipated fever 101. time 12-24 hours second shot... 12 hours fun. Education &amp; norm engineering people's choice succeed reaching herd immunity rather taking choice away inciting resistance.

Better become friends neighbour &amp; work together force compliance litigation &amp; elicit scorn.

Inspire kids, beat compliance.

How lead life? anyone think it’s possible large oversupply US much sooner anticipated... could allow countries buy vaccines US expedite vaccine timelines?

I reading articles US supply gathered following:

— J &amp; J pledges 100m doses June. (100M people)

— Moderna Pfizer committed total 170 million next 5 weeks (85M people)

20M fully vaccinated, another 20 partially. let’s say 30M vaccinated simple math.

That puts US 215M vaccination capacity June right there. 

Willingness get vaccine 60% US December. assuming hits 75% US people see others getting it, that’s 244.5M demand.

So still gap. 

But 5 weeks Moderna Pfizer vaccines takes us early April, presumably pumping even vaccines April May...

It wouldn’t shock US oversupply vaccines end May. that’s case, wouldn’t present opportunity countries?

Am missing something? Maybe wishful thinking. Europe what? 6-7 per 100? Canadá 4-5 per 100? That's shitting bed, shitting bed &lt;1 none all, dont dramatic ffs, USA, UK handful middle eastern countries way better doesnt mean every country ""shitting bed"" Covid isn’t dangerous hit retirement age.

Its risk percentage lottery. dont know severe symptoms youre going get. Theres reason many people working remote.    is, make effective What's risk? actually not. Kids going fine, resilient. 3 months nothing, need teach classroom routines full month school, coming pointless. course idea arent teacher armchair expert. quick. one month sounds really expensive app. Yeah seems like willful, wishful ignorance point. People want go gym deny fact they're COVID hotspots.

When periodontist last week, bunch signs talking COVID spray mouth hang around air long time increases chance infection. that's true, surprised applied gym. given choice, deciding continue pandemic. 

The rest us move on. 

Don’t sweat it. 28 here, I’ve several therapy appointments got referral psychiatrist, also began getting seriously debilitating panic attacks middle last year.

It feels like mental health anymore. go school education? sure arent teacher education professional think make assumptions field idea never worked in. Attending school doesnt count. I’m saying mandate everyone. I’m saying employers right mandate it. Employment America largely will. personally opposed vaccinated need find another job simple that. Comparing vaccines thalidomide fair comparison. top already preliminary evidence safe pregnant woman clinical trials going right determine safety them. We’re almost 6 months vaccination process almost 200 million shots maybe handful serious adverse reactions like Bell’s palsy referencing. level adverse reactions much differnt vaccines require many aspects life diseases actively pandemic killing hundreds thousands hospitalizing millions. Obviously risk sometimes make risky decisions alternative dangerous global pandemic. must hard work smug. kids lowest risk unless sort pre-existing condition. Don’t think so. referring Kingston Ontario, I'm also Ontario idea fuck Ford government point. colour coded decisions make sense me. LOL teacher hurt bro. work outside NYC school average salary 130K year, never work summers (dont even summer school), work exact union hours 8:15-3:15 even get longevity bonuses beginning year, mention low cost health insurance. dope pension retire rest life spouses life. Hurts doesnt it, ""lowly"" teacher eye living good. Fuck off. Give break. sacrificing extent. make home while. big deal. membership fees pay join programs online gyms online streaming live classes also hold accountable. 

Tons people injure time take break gym. can't afford gym. kids can't make gym anymore nearly much (I'm guessing kids, least little kids, would assume anyone prioritizes power lifting focused themselves). 

A gym luxury anyone says can't live without one temporarily spoiled. Everyone made sacrifices covid. friends two little kids homeschool also working home able anything wanted enjoyed. really sympathy people can't find way get weights working home. seem supply UK, US Israel fine though. question unevenly distributed. began going rock climbing gym got vaccination. surprised see exact opposite. Everybody wears mask correctly. see people taking reason, except maybe take quick drink water. Mask compliance better hospital work at. Seriously, get everyone's adament opening gyms specifically. say safest place open yet can't supply proof rediculous claim. Fat people sweating Walmart good, fit people sweating gym bad. that? No, I'm Ontario that's mean. Kingston here, imagine there's quite world. bumper plates? drop weights overhead, eh? Yeah step mother gifted set bow flex dumbbells start pandemic. Managed get 230 172  really know rural America, you? Tons people access reliable internet. Heck, driving Kansas interstate spots slow internet cell service.

I'm wondering do. family lives rural places. quick average family members come 30 people per square mile townships. lower actually live since residents right main road drive average up. guess what, single family member internet least times week. chances elderly person internet, none children internet, none grandchildren internet, none friends internet, doctor would ask basically 0. rural little contact others know anyone internet, they're rally priority anyway.  I'll give bigger companies capacity UI maintaining databases, government accept bids companies would want privatization route give everyone fair chance 

that worked real well Obamacare website /s. reality few, any, companies data mining analytics capability google, apple, amazon. sure, could bid it, bid intelligently, companies would win they've mining data decades people. likely already know age peoples' grandparents whether prefer pepsi coke. Kingston, Jamaica? What? really is. good strong body first line virus.

How much better would general public health everyone hit gym since last March? Even adding good diet eating responsibly that. Check Texas masks workouts required. long “at point” studies run full scheduled duration (two years), received full FDA approval, Emergency Use Authorization, I’m fine that. sucks. gym go everyone always masked. still feels risky it’s thing around people. haven’t seen friends family members indoors year now. else supposed eat pizza dole month? /s live NYS teaching public year strong union, yokel ass states dont shit together. California one strict US states lockdowns, combined one mote cautious compliant populations. Held strong it, Thanksgiving Christmas around time ""fuck it"" hit critical mass. Compliance nil since early December. previous studies news articles saying gyms fine (while disputed headlines enough get people gym). 
  two grocery store clerks DP’ing LTC resident? going gym herself? say least...yes. I've consistent gym goer since early 20s I'm 34 now. gym open, honestly, live blue collar bible belt town gym larger populance around taking COVID seriously. I'm going wait I've least first dose.

My wife technically social worker already received Pfizer doses extremely jealous! Really depends go for. power lifting lifting general. That's lot harder home. can't afford equipment target group well add variance. Equipment also takes space. There's also something membership fee encourage going others around. trying save lives.

hahahaha lost someone care about. wish released vaccine immediately Phase I/II trials showed decent antibody response, would gladly dose anything made somebody knows they’re around stuff.

That said, absolutely cannot force anyone take experimental treatment will. already know sure rate allergic reactions much higher would accept flu vaccine, still don’t clear readout whether Bell’s Palsy incidents mRNA trials line expected values. also know haven’t studied vaccines’ effects pregnancy. begging another thalidomide. Interpret will. I'm trying delegitimize suffering others. I'm trying give perspective. Imagine situation *normal* you, many us. Add daily bullying, ostricism, manipulation, got life.

If want downvote me, fine. I've downvoted whole life anyways. absolute shocker. SHOCKER, say.  Understood. Thanks. They're exactly new giving millions vaccines even published trial data. American company that, CEO would jail. FWIW, that's coming lab setting, protein mutations tested isolation, understand. leaked AZ data, however, showed prior infection provided statistically insignificant protection new cases. tell us anything severity cases small sample size skew ages sample, possible severe cases deaths still significantly reduced, cases may remain high SA variant. heck live kids go school 5 days week???... Zooooommm go goalposts Agreed. Work means escaping life sitting chair rotting. I’ve much happier starting job five months ago compared time spent sitting home literally 24/7 losing previous job COVID. Even commute wonders mental health. privatize healthcare portugal healthcare heroes get living wage deserve work Magnet hospital? pretty reasonable skeptical vaccines developed unprecedented timeframe. history Trump administration incredibly duplicitous also contributed rational skepticism anything promising US.

However, major vaccines gone rigorous verified trials proven highly effective - far exceeding efficacy expectations, showing overall quite safe. Logic insists wary unverified claims, willing accept peer-reviewed abundance data support them. 

We may know every last detail longest-term potential effects, pale stark insignificance comparison unknowns surrounding contracting COVID-19 itself, getting vaccinated everyone's priority possible. still nay-sayers there, mostly fringes now. I’m absolutely serious say it’s tossup lockdown depression. long covid worst case scenario, open doors wide $4 pound pretty insanity. Usually see weights $2-3 pound.

Big 5 recently stocked weights $1.5 pound ive going there. gotta get sells out. requires flu shot? Afaik even hospitals. I'll keep wearing mask polite I'm vaccinated I'm done giving shit. SHIT son got flu 5 three weeks back normal. first week hell, second third significantly lingering weakness. decline nursing homes, specifically? take PCR test *before* cross border Canada, one *when* get border, still quarantine 14 days. 

What? See: every hospital break room right now. I'm grateful longer treat friends like IEDs. job involves physically present. way we’re going get necessary herd immunity reduce spread work places employers mandate it. It’s blind hysteria. Covid deadly disease highly infectious highly effective safe vaccine greatly reduces risk spreading contracting covid. I’m morally opposed requiring vaccines consumer think logistically it’s feasible. next best thing employers require extension require consumers take it. shouldn’t vaccine required employees? think it’s unsafe? racial injustice anything sports. bad normal times? even talking about? actually prefer running mask cold. describe menthol gum nose. Lost mine today, spouse lost sense smell half week ago. I'm surprised Texas anything begin ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

I'm dude F5s CDC stats page midafternoon. look raw  lol yup, get it. im somewhat risk myself, sister disabled would likely die got it. lot lacking empathy thread, know plenty us know easy brush ""it's year."" Hope stay well! Everyone wants East Asian results without East Asian restrictions. that's metric? people total proportional distribution? That's virus works. spreads population, specifically denser area.

Did look data? Florida's distribution far erratic. New York higher population density state level NYC ridiculous. Florida barely ever stopped spreading virus downward decline couple months.

What really hurts New York get small tick, accelerates propagates wildly dense communities. That's initial hit around start 2021. Florida general distribution barely ever stops—affecting rural suburban areas worse New York.

Kids generally low risk remove even little risk kids, it’s worthwhile . :) sick January feeling chest! bizarre. never cough like before. overall goal reduce death hospitalization included 2 more. well BoJo wanting get rid restrictions months maybe allow anyone leave UK two months see well go. mean seen Israel study showing well works they're still using restrictions. Let UK test rest world I'm social family oriented person. I've seen mom twice last year seen friends. That's big sacrifice me. care less working home, part bother me. Get amazon's dick. Quit pretentious. prob live california handle working outside year. prob work out. prob everything enjoy space home. Telling people privalaged wanting ease weights treadmills. I'm going try best safe normalcy. stay hazmat suit rest life. endemic come hole zero cases. Yes, *blind optimism bad*. Obviously. There's pretty huge difference realistic unbiased, blind optimism, blind negativity. math wrong. confusing causation correlation 'working mask impossible' kind rhetoric used people take masks even goes regulations common sense, patience deal shit year.

Guess that, comments downvoted. I'm actually somewhat surprised up-front thinking process.

People even reading I'm talking about, sort ""antimasker"" group downvote.

And impossible intelligent debate society. There's place reason, subtlety, ""you're team, enemy team"" that's thinking stops. “The United States administered 68,274,117 doses COVID-19 vaccines country Thursday morning distributed 91,673,010 doses.” SII produce 2-3 mn doses per day India struggling jab 0.5 mn doses per day. ~10,000 sessions currently arranged per day target 100 vaccinations per session seems technical issues registration etc level vaccine hesitancy - barely achieving 30 sessions per day. top states holding vaccination sessions 4 days week average daily numbers even lower.

The 50 mn mentioned article pre-authorization stockpile (a good chunk probably exported ~36 mn doses IIRC) . definitely oversupply - bright side India opening vaccination 60+ population people aged 45+ risk factors , roping private healthcare system - scaling session per day 3-5X . Hopefully increases usage, however even level India able consume daily production yet.

Further, Bharat Biotech's vaccine also authorized use (~10% vaccinations till now) Sputnik V expected get authorised emergency use sometime March.

Govt. India's dashboard daily vaccinations : Tell I’m wrong hitting 2 mil per day average end next week......NO EXCUSES!!! Someone bored lol Ehhhhh.... ignoring huge part problem.

Growing up, mom always cooked dinner family. parents worked traditional 40 hour week jobs, would get home around time siblings got spend evenings weekends together. mom teacher, got vacations together well. siblings never worry next meal came from, mom made something “gross” didn’t want eat it, didn’t eat dinner night. 

We extremely privileged isn’t case every family. Picture this: single parent works multiple jobs make ends meet. get spend maybe hours home every night kids work weekends. really think energy spend 90 minutes prepping, cooking, cleaning dinner? importantly, think want waste hours children this? happens one kids throws fit meal don’t understand meal day? Education, affordability, accessibility important there’s one even critical aspect: Time. long lower class forced spend 60+ hours week working minimum wage, continue issue. 

This studied extensively. educate people cows come home still fall back unhealthy eating habits. goes affordability/accessibility; give people fresh, organic produce world don’t time anything it, it’ll go trash. Jamie Oliver’s Food Revolution excellent example this. People complex motivations behind food choices everyone ignores “Well guess don’t know better” much easier explanation “Maybe society shouldn’t force single parents work three shitty jobs.” naive takeaway article. 
Because thing happens 8 12 weeks, people going say ""NO! FORGOT TEST 16 20 WEEKS! THAT'S EFFECTIVE!""

It's known Johnson Johnson, uses tech Astrazeneca using, effective. So, something extremely odd Astrazeneca. believe news coming Russia Sputnik, even bigger question mark vaccine poor testing/results. matter USA style export ban UK style contrack lock result - exports. call EU naive contracts something change whenever might another pandemic - hopefully soon. 
With 'It's smaller population within developed country' mean larger countries takes time supply mean smaller countries effective rolling out? Denmark buying EU block 6-7 times bigger UK sure supply limiting factor. Larger countries resources poor reason holding fast tempo. miss point? EU 7 times bigger UK UK 10 times bigger DK guess cant compare UK EU? sorry bringing size good performance indicator.
Canada would like vaccines, unfortunately get supplies EU sites. Australia seems ok waiting.
It seems complicated Wales/Scotland/England commonly referred country sovereign state. UK proberly nation-state ""culturally homogeneous groups people, larger single tribe community, share common language, institutions, religion, historical experience"" really hope blow past 2M mark supply increases. think? argument person school, sports addition school. Uh, previous models say deaths would millions? heard like 1.4mill even 3 million around time? Based models people expected deahts millions US alone.

500k deaths lot, compared models earlier, even remotely close worse case all. still pretty bad. told would 500k deaths around time models released last year would really skeptical would low. We’ve also completely lost perspective risk. Lockdowns restrictions originally supposed protecting hospital capacity people get sick need it, eliminating illness entirely; still can’t reopen something important schools every single teacher vaccinated *OMG someone might get sick.*

There risk life. plot completely lost want put “safety” else. could but

I don’t get anxious light-headed/passing &amp; heart palpitations tapered gradually months. Nothing life changed make less, “anxious.” Light-headed/tunnel vision every time stood gradually stopped around April. Heart palpitations stopped June.

I’ve never pink eye life. 

I know body recognize exhaustion it’s fighting cold. It’s always 1st sign 1st symptom. hit HARD fast lasted weeks. 

Nothing like anxiety symptoms. might steal this! Yeah ifr covid higher way way infectious flu. evidence likely see flu infectious deadly covid. Yeah, I’ll probably downvoted saying think need face fact things returning normal soon, one way another. problem complying mandates whatnot, believe won’t miss them. you’re morbidly obese it’s addiction. It’s less choice compulsion need help. don’t think anyone chooses massively fat.

I don’t really care smokers getting vaccine either, don’t want die. There's moustache twitching. 

It's like Facebook data sharing. anyone Facebook looking share data nefariously, happens. read something day we're back together flu circulating, going horrendous bc bodies exposed germs long. York

Thats exactly right.  NY hit massive wave, (Trump era) CDC telling people COVID aerosolized, mask wearing important hand washing surface cleaning, etc.  Given NYC's massive population density, misinformation devastatingly can’t explain Florida worse is.

It's widely believed Florida, Trump-supporter Gov. DeSantis, misrepresenting COVID case data nearly year.  top data scientist turned whistleblower months ago tell us FLs COVID Deaths under-reported, retaliation, DeSantis arrested, home illegally searched, papers illegally seized.  think anyone health policy willing take Florida's self-reported stats face value point. article read India, South Africa, UK, Sweden Canada? actually agree you. parents high risk, brother. really hope vaccine retains efficacy safe. 

But people get vaccine, stop living like this. Oktoberfest wont happen especially rate EU vaccinating people German Gov strict right borders. soft point think fragile minds can't handle constant bad news need good news balance get depressed :(. Imagine living real shit like ancestors did.

This might literally nonsensical thing I've ever read reddit, saying ton starting supply side.

The US government went allocating 4.5M Pfizer doses states last week, 6.8M week, 8M next week expected continue increase least another couple weeks that. J&amp;J gets running, assuming Moderna bumps distribution bit (they're expected far know) going seem pretty massive. husband, children insanely cautious since began. store year, kids virtual school only, seeing family anyone, etc. recently fully vaccinated (me husband, kids obviously old enough) happily hosting fully vaccinated friends family homes without masks distancing. I'm comfortable enough evidence have. info AZ SA quote leaked info shown fully vetted? so, seems weird include it. think best point severity Covid resulting mass deaths reason ever stopped paid attention Covid first place. Without one would’ve ever really paid attention flu season got sick, that’s kinda expected happen everyone point lives.

If best point, stripped doctorate. little different Trump's ""If stop testing right now, we'd cases, any."" Dr Ghandi implies separation covid's consequences, public response it. course pay attention covid, disease, sudden increase severe illness, deaths, long-term complications. public response covid covid dangerous. reason conveniently dismissed order facilitate premature reopening, matter hard try create one. category five surge of... VACCINES!!!! 3-4m doses day soon realistic f\*cking year, ""experts"" talking another whole year nonsense. I'm done, lot people done, pretty soon tiny minority. vaccine going nail coffin lockdowns mask mandates -they'll next 0 public support majority population vaccinated. agree. wrong exclude smokers getting lung transplants, current policy. all, smokers need lung transplants most. Within week two begins can't wait excuses guys come people can't anything even vaccine available everyone. gonna funny sad time. us family members raised foster care abusive situations longer contact. wish would acknowledge easy reality people. example, know couple IMMEDIATELY went vacation getting FIRST shot suddenly felt safer. that's works. 

Going vacation mean automatically contract spread COVID, either... Infinite years 

Hey look, again, thing serious person talking yet terrifies people refuse take COVID seriously!  

After vaccination may still need mitigation efforts. fault entirely agree need, government ass explaining this. Preventing symptomatic disease =/= preventing transmission. Danish government issued tender private companies help quadruple capacity **400,000 shots day — 8.5 per cent adult population — next month** end July. aiming administer jabs 3m people, bulk adult population, seven weeks start contracting private health clinics occupational health companies help accelerate vaccination drive, aiming deliver nearly 4m jabs month April June adult population 8.2m.


Wow. Ambitious. Reasonable distrust government maybe, say skepticism vaccine valid. Honestly, ask people they're getting vaccine, they're gonna say anything Tuskegee, they'll say something like ""I think pushed think safe"" maybe ""this like AIDS, invented government make black people infertile."" encourage thinking way That's great hear!

In CA, however, still online. sounds like CSUs mostly online despite brightening outlook. get cautious discouraging. honest see health department cant somehow put code passport scan shows vaccinated. vaccine passport international travel bother one bit. wife who's Italy planning going back home see parents grandparent last Christmas cancelled obvious reasons. hoping go August. show we've vaccinated it.   really wouldnt bother talking person. do....because smart.. /s wish.[1]

Thanks confirming. 20s 30s, almost certainly lower risk dying COVID someone 65+  snowstorm last week pace reach 2 million day we’re going see almost 1.5 times number doses next month probably almost 2-2.5 times doses April. first month vaccination slow supply constraints. Supply going ramping lot next two months administration likely catch couple weeks way supply increases. health officials really mentality saying never end. Americans issued personal bubble walk around (though much point going plastic bubble since everything closed. dangerous.) covid exposure, i'm scared mom, old healthy, fear may shows symptoms healthy general, takes vaccine deteriorate

I'm certain younger kids 10 though. can't even begin speculate % parents opt get younger kids vaccinated shot available. think China, “experienced” authoritarian government, understands something western governments largely don’t. order maintain control, “push” citizens, cannot “break” (at least en masse). China understands want avoid mass revolution, ensure population least relatively happy, time. Hence brief “shows force” Covid basically nothing elaborate performances (for citizens, world) China’s governmental “superiority.” know part “declaring battle” necessity WIN—whether reality corresponds messaging not. 

Thus uncomfortable truth world idea whatsoever many outbreaks China had, many deaths they’ve had, etc. China announces outbreaks politically beneficial so, announce outbreaks “contained” politically beneficial so. they’re nearly naive foolish western governments LARPing totalitarian Covid—China wants *stay* authoritarian, therefore understands (unlike western governments) approach “The Beatings Continue Morale Improves” guarantees eventual discontent revolt part citizens. base pretty much eats “my plan good, never change even once, thats much stable genius am”. Lmao plague. Stay scared, won’t stop going every day. CDC needs go every school board send information every schoolboard implementing better ventilation. Otherwise schoolboards enforce teachers keep windows closed.. little fresh air never hurt anyone learning. Plus could nice students..  Nice! remember March 16th shut said thing. guidelines first discussed thought even one month would crazy...  Except states CAN'T get people vaccinated quickly. 

I'd rather give people bad news people get even lax masks such, over. Wonder would be? What's amazing people really resistant hearing news can't take anymore mind starts going denial even made far. prediction scientists making huge spike. scientists see Covid becoming endemic background virus like coronaviruses summer. Guess ones get breathless headlines? I’m sure qualified pick ones accurate, see locations variants cases dropping like stone, previous worst case models proven accurate.  really different many health conditions get priority. Cancer strongly linked personal care habits, still priority patients got cancer smoking, chew, etc. Heart conditions also linked eating exercise. Organ transplant recipients arent weeded depending need could tied life choices. Type 2 diabetes? Smoking? CDC high risk list get priority vaccine. Hell even pregnancy, something voluntary (99% time). 

On hand list conditions dont get priority still may put people increased risk lot illnesses arent within persons control. Asthma, cystic fibrosis, dementia type 1 diabetes ect. 

It might help look terms saving lives reducing additional long term health issues, rather rewarding people letting get priority. Many people handed lot power whether justified, going want give up. Many get thrill becoming petty tyrants able declare grandma off-limits “for protection”, otherwise exerting control life elevating self-perceived moral status importance. people, including politicians, may even served public good past year, expect lockdown onerous rules continue far longer reasonable cling reasons developments suggesting public can’t trusted hug grandma without permit, nasal swab supervisor. Yeah don’t really choice work. I’m contractor clients building. second job office I’m trying move hours become available. Lol mods kinda suck here. elementary school teachers getting throughout Italy including thousands small towns everywhere last couple weeks. 10 times better means deadly seems? 7 day moving average flat. agree decline seems ended. doubting narrative lack localized spikes. would expect places front variants big threat advertised. half baked thesis US, poor capacity sequencing, already variants pretty much everywhere, imported ones may big news imagined. Granted half baked best. Yes would think comparing countries decide 80% worth considering gone logic somewhere.

We're not. We're comparing living conditions _possible_, possible.

Subsistence farmers serfs work much Americans do.  read articles post headlines? 

The articles posted address transmission person walking hallway another person walking behind hallway. Holy shit, teach where? coverage emphasize threat remains, get lot people vaccinated quickly, get this. 

&lt;cries agree guess I’m sure it’s heart much trying seen worst mayor decades. 

Wanting help low income Spanish community anyone speaks Spanish massive fail. It’s incompetence we’ve seen repeatedly vaccine rollout school reopening too. stealing tuna sandwiches break room fridge? know one crabpeople. Hahah thanks man schools can't even afford paper, kids bring in. 

Even liberal states forcing kids back 80 year old school buildings broken windows unvaccinated teachers.

The CDC whatever wants, teachers schools virtually last priority entire pandemic, school funding/reform last priority general country. 

It change now. Especially without money.

There's reason biggest wave virus directly coincided people going back school. mystery. really didnt mean dont think that. contextually, would feel guilty got someone sick, wasnt supposed to. would *feel* bad, make sense, edit post. say theyre nervous right   live Germany there's fair news, working side effects, like fever. gotten bad half appointments turned up.
I know would rather biontech/ Pfizer apparently we're allowed it, people 65 years age.. received first dose Moderna vaccine hour ago so. 
I excited little bit apprehensive side effects. figure severe side effects would manifested shortly after. 

Anyways excited get vaccine hopefully get back normal. Lol, already two vaccines shots anticipating able travel overseas even end year. get hopeful, continue optimistic.  you’re point people excited better going libraries gyms makes angry, probably log off...

Yeah. literally gotten strongest leanest I'd ever finally fine-tuned horrible metabolism powerhouse (eating 3k calories day losing fat increasing muscle mass). 6x week 3 hours day gym rat lol, can't wait get vaxx get back it, great outlet work 9-5 desk job. would bet many office jobs part- mostly-remote over, I'll also bet *entirely* remote. realize doubling lie counterproductive right?  Definitely take first one offered you. AZ proved protection serious outcomes like hospitalizations deaths. trials elderly SA variants under-powered, even groups 100% effective hospitalizations deaths. Misinformation lmao savings gone, money gone. can't restart business without money. problem country too. simply money. point vast majority clamoring full reopening likely people would likely defund public schools believe teacher unions powerful, they've never schools forefront worries before. suddenly want schools open, even though U.S. public school system general honestly good quite sometime? Many schools asking funding help almost decades point, public generally turned blind eye them. suddenly people care schools open? Funny. 

They also falsely asserted schools drive pandemic, spread high schools. recent comprehensive studies show true, especially looking UK UK variant (which probably pretty much everywhere United States winter months, form it). 

Combine two, makes many people skeptical motivations want schools open full person learning. Especially many educators made concerns well known regarding older buildings poor ventilation (many public school buildings decades old, HVAC systems dating way back 50s), fact school administrators tend cut corners appease people. Shoulda done earlier good happening now.

I hope policies place sure second dose administered time. patients monitored patients showing signs adverse reaction.

Seems like critical info :) daily average last 5 months countries worst days height spikes.

The numbers constantly surging, feel like it. Many culture jobs gone end 2021. trend continue 2022, 2023, 2024. take *decades* rebuild jobs. guy building adamant going gym(older guy) started reopening summer. little pod going hanging garage outside people building would stop time time.

I told goes gym want coming around garage said terrible idea reasons study stated. got butthurt came around saw bad idea go. probably went north Arabs living in East Jerusalem and the Druze in the Golan Heights, occupied Israel the Six-Day War of 1967 later annexed, offered Israeli citizenship, refused, wanting recognize Israel's claim sovereignty. became permanent residents instead. They right apply citizenship, entitled municipal services municipal voting FL actually awesome pandemic compared big states tho (NY CA) Well, I’m sure it’s nurses, TBF heard American doctor pay lot things doctor, malpractice insurance, covered countries public healthcare like Portugal. there’s also paying university loans, course, Portugal anything like Spain, public universities much cheaper. happy little post fine Thursday. husband getting first shot next weeks. point, parents fully vaccinated. gone year without seeing parents, finally get reunite April May  It’s crazy things really started getting real March last year here. March 2021 completely different situation. 

LET’S THIS. Yes!!

Edit: need curfew close schools . UK variant finishing supplanting wild type. That's Italy doing. Opening AZ younger categories reserving mRNA vaccines older population. I've never quite wrapped head around many people opposed mask-wearing, one simplest precautions one take pandemic. I've heard floated around before, might psychological factor involved? Like, innate resistance face covering? 

Do think current pandemic response accounted enough? not, could factor future pandemic responses? Point is, need create vaccine capacity next time merci generous generous countries ever again. masks. leaders Canada. want hear long term plans sides aisle. I’m trying get people sick man idk everyone’s fucking problem is. long days work OT site full time rare, they’re physically mentally taxing work, stuff kill whole lot faster covid. 

But I’m sure guy that’s got 50lbs works bed gonna come along tell I’m im asshole intermittent fasting Look UK track trace studies. show gyms safe gym, people basically stopped wearing mask. I'm li New York. wear chin. huddle groups together. guys even make fun friends wearing mask take down. like 99% men this. Meanwhile women weight lifting going hard cardio machine wear correctly ENTIRE time. Staff walk right see wearing mask say nothing. know gym judgement free zone, I'm judging lol smh. gym easily among important places wear mask.

NO Shoes shirt Mask= Service! tried everyone said person could hear lmao. i’m loud Funnily enough, UK’s track trace system showed transmission extremely low gyms highly doubt Desantis current lawmaker defending medically qualified back suspect lockdown scepticism rather critical thinking regarding efficacy vaccine?

You seem conflating individual stories harm hard judged decisions roll vaccine lockdown - clearly saved lives real world.

I understand reasoning. vaccine work? Well, certainly harm. lockdowns unnecessary? Well, that's clearly case. like lockdown? That's fine say unjustly question vaccine.

Bizarre post worst still gone upvotes one showing increase large. weekly average still slightly. I'm sure planet fitness fine, aside January theres never anyone there. live Netherlands, briefly closed elementary schools twice cases conclusion necessary stop spread. 

It insane many US schools remain closed. overwhelming evidence closing schools hurts kids serious ways, little evidence schools play big role spreading COVID-19. 

Frankly, adults awful statistics hard time sizing risks like these. Parents teachers let panic get hold kids paying price. seems part missing paragraph, 16% November lacks current number referred ""that significant increase"" Ireland's plan accounts 73 million possible AZ deliver 180 million Q2 think it’s great news EU source vials European supply chain. I'm talking views. taking views. would pay attention told yourself. Unfortunately third 'isolated figure' showing increase within last two weeks. don’t confront people, brave sir? want resign, totally fucked vaccinations far. put someone charge make vaccinations top-most priority (and steal doses designated US, whatever else necessary), think ending lockdown. CNN oppinion pieces nowadays? Haven’t scrolled thru awhile. wondering folks think things dr. Osterholm dr. Deary saying weeks. Osterholm seems think enter worst it. B1 variant it’s 2 mutations gonna hit hard middle march. hope feel bad day getting vaccine. take immunosuppressant drug doctor concerned vaccine may provoke strong immune response. Feeling bad would indication did. New York

Hang on, there's *New York* variant now?! Yes. AZ may slightly less effective mRNA variants, still offers good protection much better unvaccinated. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

1. keeping healthy body
2. maybe helping mentally

this tourism, us want visit relatives havent seen year you’re advocating medical treatment kind? Unfortunate case Strep life threatening, cured antibiotic? Tough break, can’t let weak immune system spread. Broke leg? Well, it’ll either heal well enough function you’ll get removed gene pool. Probably best, bones probably weak probably broke something stupid. I'm sure explained death already, exactly virus still effectively spread someone who's vaccinated it? (My understanding need continue wearing masks getting vaccinated.)

Let's say I'm vaccinated. 12 days second shot, whatever. vaccine 100% online.

Now someone coughs get Covidized.

If virus still reproduce easily, benefit get vaccine?

If can't, extremely unlikely I'll pass along someone else? transmissible Covid immune system blasting bits? Cuomo killed 13k+ people? Cuomo? Maybe guys stricter precautions Cuomos [Humor, slightly serious] continues fantastic news, isn’t really news anymore right? almost need sticky links articles vaccine. sub overflowing basic news. love Germans, idea stereotype comes lol  fact purchased doesn’t mean they’ll necessarily delivered according proposed timeline. “upscaling vaccine purchasing” arguably helped cause Pfizer delays, expanded production capacity meet new contracts/the demand caused countries seeing success exercising purchase options more.

It may well happen there’s plenty go round July August... may not. It’s important remember immunity immediate requires time build and, vaccines, also requires two spaced-out shots (quite far apart AZ’s case). definitely agree gym owner, little coincidental sewage magically backs health department already trying shut down? stinks sabotage.... shit. can’t choir practice via Zoom. tried Susan always tempo crappy DSL internet. thatv recovering winter storm. We'll see slow steady increase daily vaccinations 3mil 4mil, 5mil, hopefully drop we'll almost fine point. want lockdown next months? highest efficacy I've seen ~95% reducing hospitalization. exceptionally good, still leaves 5% people vulnerable life-threatening symptoms covid. I'm phone maybe someone else provide source. efficacy approved vaccine pretty widely available Google. didn’t know abou incident. info it? curiosity field. field? Oh don’t run away mad. 

We starting fun particular brand Teutonic whackery.  Gyms issues schools “well they’re gonna get sick” issue. Sure, they’re high risk serious Covid complications, still catch spread it. 

Our school desperately begging parents dose kids medicine (like usually do) keep kids home symptoms. Four days back school, kid showed immediately told teacher headache. Positive Covid. 

I feel like chances “regular” sick already drastically lower. Mask wearing hand cleanliness means kiddo less risk getting cold flu well. FWIW trials done ""in real world"" That's problem, schools opened states, back 30-40K per day time. Yup. jealous happy travel. Btw, travel priviledge. Shut fear mongering  science-based regular trial periods, mean multi-year efforts hampered bureaucratic red tape, politics, lobbying, endless funding applications, process components expedited order test COVID vaccines? useless mild asymptomatic Covid though?

It least 76% efficacy one shot original UK variant. SA variant uncertain know yet, trial small. work hospital. first lock down, everyone called us heros clapped night.
It beyond cringe inducing hours got cut work. want get paid, PPE, hours. mean, public narrative year even mild cases COVID extremely dangerous otherwise healthy/young people.

Really? narrative used? two narratives I've commonly used are

1. dangerous old people may cause cases serious illness young/healthy.
2. 99.9% people get away without anything. Remove NPI measures right away!

The tug war seems two main lines politicians balance actions accordingly, 1st (most world leaders) 2nd (Bolsonaro, Trump, American governors). ""extremely dangerous young/healthy"" line tiny minority completely ignored everyone except maybe alarmist clique. examples fitness classes, gymbros solitary thing. makes sense shut whole gym classes issue. exactly I'm coming - bought initial wave variant fear Dec/Jan reading actual data, almost always much less worrisome MSM articles summarizing data are. Maybe point drastic narrow minded, came bit defensive. Nothing replicate well made barbell weights. Ha, March hit fan. Rep fitness sells heavy duty duffel bags smaller nylon bags fill sand, duffel bags handles throughout bag different exercises. know it’s fucking winter right? Like 20 degrees outside winter? irresponsible one that. u right, i'm prone red eye i'm extra careful aren’t whole lot options besides gym want lift heavy weights. everyone keep hundreds lbs iron home gym. Well know they'll getting sinovac dont trust chinese vaccines Good people! Honestly, send country use fucks sake. 

Every time someone refuses vaccine, vaccine earmarked someone else wants it, done immediately. 

If population want vaccine, give away now. ""Encourage."" incentive? I’m teacher fully vaccinated mid March, bad go back next week. room windows somehow leaks rains :)

I less worried though. Lots coworkers apprehensive vaccine. Lots students live grandparents others single parents. Honestly it’s bad situation. skeletal staff, custodians main office essential we’ve three shut downs due covid. thing start see big time herd effects approach period. time virus probably never gone. chances transmission going drop low point risk low fades background risks? State Federal government kept school budgets absolute minimum decades. want already bankrupt system renovate 20, 30 even 40+yo buildings overnight government failed controlling virus. Stop spending trillions bailing corporations, BAIL SCHOOLS! decent education system place, corporations going starved talent desperately need carry on, happily relocate country does. Life hard, leadership makes hard sheer stupidity, greed selfishness. yearly super spreader event? could possibly go wrong? many media outlets wrong right? wrong? Yeah, kinda unfortunate actually crazies pushing social media. mean nothing, right? Daily over-dramatized garbage. semester practically over. hurt anyone close schools teachers vaccinated. know, except people rely school daycare. covid outbreaks two specific gyms ""linked carelessness masks symptoms""

Fat Redditors: durrrrrrrr cOuRsE gYmS UnSaFe *shits pants* last piece saw UK expect masks measures put place Fall. anybody realize depressing going hard implement again? 
People fun summer boom right back distancing Fall testing nearly much last March. yeah, realize. Alas, what's one do. Oh okay! Thanks clearing up!  Kids back school like normal 99.9% districts. Yes, school districts stated otherwise, but... look they're LA: ""Zoom blackout"". Neither parents children stand madness longer necessary People burned naiveté many experience early pandemic, thinking would short lived. Getting rosy speeches would soon. 

Its unfortunate easily predictable would awhile lied to. easy see light end tunnel, sounds naive say it. UK South Africa lockdowns awhile. Lockdowns drop cases whether it’s variant not. Brazil regional lockdowns. Brazil definitely “plummeting,” it’s either plateau rising bit. least-strict restrictions three named.  No, schools stay virtual semester (which practically anyway)

Then vaccinate teachers, summer break happens, school opens fully fall. people impatient that. except allow play playgrounds like 3.5 year old go day care. total nuts need kept check, they're bad anti vax idiots someone keen idea vaccinated AstraZeneca would really prefer Pfizer/Moderna, I'd happy government decided communicated concrete policy, involving following things:

- penalty refusing AZ (i.e. queue one end: end say, at-risk groups vaccinated mRNA vaccines?)

- penalty *accepting* AZ. take AZ, cannot ""update"" mRNA (even become plentiful) ""sorry buddy, protocol says already vaccinated, cannot get two vaccines"" would big argument taking AZ.

I would respect policy. Pushing picky end queue, say, would collectively make sense. can't argue it.

I want know policy be, make decision. right now, least country, one clear consequences possible decision. China’s medical products regulator said Thursday approved two COVID-19 vaccines public use, raising number domestically produced vaccines used China four.

The four approved Chinese vaccines stored normal freezer temperatures - potential selling point less affluent countries might difficulty deploying vaccines Pfizer Moderna require much colder temperatures longer-term storage.
The three companies secured supply deals overseas, China donated doses made Sinopharm’s Beijing unit numerous countries. China exporting vaccines 27 countries providing free doses 53 countries, foreign ministry spokesman said Tuesday.  true. think big issue science much nuanced lot things, many journalists don’t typically report science aren’t great conveying nuance. Also, think journalists often get bad rap reality criticism directed editors write headlines. flip side people probably read headlines, many not. don’t think it’s straw man all. Even quote isn’t plain yes/no. part said it’s CDC. 
If it’s common sense say word: “yes”

Our public messaging snd media abysmal don’t accept people need able parse words assume “very likely can” way saying yes. phrase still uncertainty it. easy see things approached people idea not. Fauci needs understand he’s PR guy now. He’s face response. stopped doctor months ago.   mean many people let die rather show discipline? Fair trade off.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* read post history you’ll know sarcastic. Even risk 35 without pre-existing insignificant.

My personal tolerance (as unvaccinated 35 65) 65+ crowd chance going back distancing unless local hospital conditions require it. course people choose self isolate safety long want won’t judge them. see smaller, isolated places like New Zealand accomplish think accomplished everywhere. naive thinking ran New Zealand simulation 65 times (US population 65x New Zealand’s), would come covid free time. even people it, either get lucky isolate them, start inevitable exponential growth back again. 

In opinion, hindsight available, strategy focusing isolation care elderly highest risk overall damage society blanket lockdowns. consider entire planet league. know league would can’t wait unsub subreddit don’t think will. Me? No, covid. dont think I've really caught anything past year. ""Interestingly, younger adults tend experience intense symptoms second dose older adults do. “The immune response robust young healthy,” says Wilbur Chen, M.D.,""
Yup, happy leave consiquences immunized now. Fauci grown up, intelligent man. think needs told anyone messaging detrimental TV personality? Or, think enjoying center attentions? variant mutation exist not? does, isn’t whole point research here? controversial? wear mask, funeral grandmother November Iowa preacher told us take masks shot right away. Right albeit we're looking good better safe sorry. Unless vaccine mask staying 6 feet away. I'm one germaphobes either, better safe able work getting rona sit weeks possibly giving family member Brazil, Peru, Czechia France spikes numbers, declining way, explanation simple: France Czechia explosion numbers mutated UK covid, Brazil Peru crunched Brazil(Manaus) mutation, states 60% cases new mutation. 

USA lucky right mass vaccination climbing, stop new variants spread double USA, worse states open everything, including schools, soon. Way 26 year olds normally die. Kinda like deadly pandemic dangerous, no?

I'll never understand logic people try diminish serious concerns. call pro-death cult I'll label idiot move life. rate decrease CA bottoming daily number new cases still elevated range last summer’s surge. haven’t seen data that’s case though. Could lifting restrictions and/or people getting complacent again. Could variants. something else. China rich much misinformation one post.

Sending hugs. Interesting seems Western world counts ""actual"" world many people scientific proof immediately second shot you’re protected? Let’s see that. Sitting inside year need fat suit.  Umm forget schools underfunded first place? Leading effort 😂
Meanwhile, every large american tech fashion brand gets stuff made there. Never gonna change. New York Times coverage past ~month freaking BAD messaging around vaccines. make case net result many discouraged getting vaccines now. problem moment, supply choke point, worry happen 1-2 months supply significantly available. collectively depend enough us getting shot order put thing (more less) behind us. mean 10% US vaccinated. like widespread availability use vaccine yet. 3,200 people die yesterday Covid US. Vaccines make go away, said still going months ahead this. March 5th me. Can't come soon enough! par course daily threads. like 11 upvotes multiple people downvoted me. Kinda used tbh. Spread (as measured positive PCRs, 7 day average) dropped 249k early Jan 70k today, 72% decline. last 6 weeks, 10-15% vaccinated (and ~40% immune due natural infection). 85% drop seems likely months, weeks even. 

This doesn’t mean we’ll reach community spread ever, think likely Covid forever circulate one dozens respiratory illnesses call ‘cold’ kills number frail people every year like flu, pneumonia, 4 coronaviruses etc. problem ""how many"" (it's QUANTITY)

The problem way accurately predict (on individual basis) mild severe outcome may individual people. 

How Corona virus attacks body (and particular ways may ""cascade"" individual person) highly dependent wide variety factors .... factors really know full extent yet. 

There specific individual ""personalized-medicine"" approach fighting Covid19. generic/generalities. 

If goal ""stay alive"".. best strategy take (in kind unknown situation). err side ""to cautious"". 

Being ""not cautious enough"" .. playing Russian roulette life (and lives others). matter picky it. Authorities decided vaccinate elderly first, AZ given people 65. 70, wife still gotten invite either two.

People 65, working emergency medical positions getting AZ offers still enough AZ vaccine people, limited locations offered all. learned anything from/wallstreebets buy dip.
I'll wait till next month celebrate introduced Reddit community worms Spanish politics :)

The above, mixed aftermaths civil war nearly 100y ago fuel fire tearing decades. fight constitution allegedly permits autonomies try brought country almost another civil war years ago...

And still going! Sure feels like we’re headed. employee hunting store, I’m telling someone wear mask don’t want fucking killed. likely

The way phrasing sounds like “probably.” message comes across “not yet, don’t know sure.” article even says public health officials still urging social distancing. can’t say “yes?” need hedge every positive statement idea still risk isn’t fully encouraged?

When comes possible bad scenarios, messaging always “this going happen people need prepare.” Complete confidence hedging. would use tone good news, people would feel ease. Clearly coming across significant portion population still feeling hopeless. made laugh telling there's chance...  That's good point.  actually seen data shows absolute case #'s involving variants increasing. seen data says ""increase % cases."" Meanwhile cases steeply. find variant tracker shows raw #'s B117 *decreasing*.   bleeds leads we're thawing almost freezing death.... average Reddit user doesn’t care gyms stay closed. I’m shocked  can’t serious. Wtf shame useful cases. Asia masks normalized SARS 2003. “Hiding home” insinuating *remote* weakness taking precautions global pandemic. We, United States, sit 511k deaths lest forget. Keep walking luck hubris pray don’t go back words matter time quick happen. wear mask one-on-one meeting boss, COVID half year ago?

It's still possible get infected new corona mutation right? least statistically proven otherwise.

I'm planning wear mask, knowing her, insist take friendly chat. Unless elderly and/or immunocompromised, drive airport going far dangerous covid, statistical standpoint. Thank you, helpful. They're middle pack deaths per capita despite one oldest states population. They're also densely populated ton tourism. things considered shockingly well. kind already happening begin ponder ways lift restrictions... vaccine requirements effectively banish kids public sphere. absolute ones I've seen far cruise ships pondering late summer start-ups vaccine requirements place passengers (no exceptions). Nevermind fact vaccinated 60 year old carries slightly less risk hospitalization death COVID unvaccinated 15 year old. concerning, terrible job providing context. LA Times recently described CA Variant saying ""The Devil Here"" provided speculation, without evidence, would defeat vaccine. 

However, CA variant less vaccine evasion ability South African one, Fauci others said vaccines protect against. knew follow subreddit, someone reading news would terrified.

The way media presents COVID news always play pessimistic scenario possible, uses call continued additional restrictions. EU tried fairly hard open last Summer even though pandemic still fully rolling. many Americans likely vaccinated bet try open vaccinated people.  me, think death symptom need much testing, lol.

Not sure understand basic premises expressed here, feel like lost beyond capabilities help. know prices countries? UK think quite bit  Anti-maskers walk grocery store without mask give shit. clarification, wear mask order enter establishment.

Also people refuse get vaccinated far worse people am. ones spewing vitriol to.

Seriously many germophobic people sub won’t even go house without putting hazmat suit. That’s extremely unhealthy behavior choosing live life way. He's saying spread = immunity = done sooner. That's say desirable reduce spread reasons. reducing spread anything get us back normal quicker. gains us.  Listen don’t like go biz. point you’ll infected. understand burn nurses currently handling covid patients shortage medical care find need future may luck. 
Just selfish. know people mad geez. 

[Death, Nurse’s Maybe wouldn’t many dead Americans people hit gym time time.  Good journalism matter. However, people see isnt good journalism, propaganda. Good journalism usually entails pissing people power, happen connected MSM broadcasters/news outlets, people rapidly get fired. agree, tough sell career fair. Ok, semantics. Maybe extend *pandemic* certainly extended restrictions many areas case numbers going down. know state, absolute explosion cases holiday governor extended restrictions re-limited household gatherings. ""Nearly half, including Lopes, make 1,205 euros ($1,465) per month tax.

After tax, take home little 980 euros, 315 euros minimum wage, according Nurses’ Order.""

&amp;#x200B;

Ouch, comparison (assuming 172 hours (4.3 weeks) average work month) that's $8.52 per hour. Generally speaking nurses starting pay US $20+ per hour. small part (live) culture is/was tailored high-wage people. Ahh see go college Yet EU whines AZ vaccines. Maybe look problems blaming someone else.  upsetting people making poor life choices get prioritized (in many places smokers get higher priority too), realistically rest population going get vaccinated shortly thereafter. many countries people make poor life choices getting extra weeks people.

So end day, obese still far better life-choice. trust statistics coming governor's office agency controls wonder play US, too. similar problem verifying who's working essential business isn't. soon lot shots available per day, compounds ""problem"".

My guess soon, maybe April already, CDC say: ok, open season, it, boys! confused. article specifically mentions various ways improve ventilation, including opening windows using air purifiers. part disagreeing exactly? 

Also, improving ventilation yield significant long-term gains since colds (rhinovirus human coronaviruses), flu, several viruses tend plague schools would mitigated ventilation improvements. lot people best stress relief. me, aside physical health benefits, essentially mental health treatment, well.

""We need protect public health!"" (Make hard impossible stay shape source stress-relief.)

Just like ""Close beaches! Close parks! Stay home gain weight, order takeout watch Netflix! need people, faces screen!"" issue there's talk ""endgame."" virus always going constant state flux mutation, point collectively accept ""new normal"" involves living COVID way live Influenza, etc. So, look like? line? know get there? completely absent conversation.

The messaging lately risk elimination, completely impossible. fact people still OK shutting world baffling.. seems plenty people who's lives somewhat inconvenienced measures, fine extending indefinitely. However, many people NEED get back ""normal"" state. effects shutdowns felt decades. even peak pandemic, consensus whether strict lockdowns created net positive society. acceptable perspective public health officials, mental health experts economists.

I'm saying disagree measures taken, conversation limited specific topics perspectives. Now, harvesting fruit -- considering metrics virus, every union political activism group bone pick leveraging pandemic get want.. benefit environment fear uncertainty. typically buy models floor directly unless sold specifically such, case would expect minimum legally required get door. said unbiased.

European leaders trying restore faith. Ursula von der Leyen, European Commission president, told Augsburger Allgemeine Bavaria vaccine “just safe products BioNTech/Pfizer Moderna”. Jens Spahn, German health minister, said would gladly injected AstraZeneca vaccine.

There signs message yet fully sink in. Reports Belgium parts Germany indicate large numbers people offered AstraZeneca shots failed turn up. French health ministry said would launch public campaign overcome vaccine’s “image deficit”. Yesterday allowed doctors use members public 50 64 less half GPs ordered doses. scepticism universal: Italy reports no-shows.

In Germany, 6.4 per cent population received first shot vaccine, frustration building. Yesterday Bild, country’s bestselling newspaper, published front page UK’s vaccination successes headline: “Dear Brits, envy you.” completely different experience. know number people it, 2 friends family members die it, 3 coworkers ICU almost died. Yeah like Idiocracy real life...  Ah yes, unbiased well informed source.. O’Toole 😂

Try again.  [1]

The rollout Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine Europe hampered bureaucratic glitches public suspicion driven leaders’ scepticism.

Germany used 15 per cent 1.4 million doses delivered. poll suggested half population would rather wait receive eminent virologist called second-class vaccine.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* It’s much different people follow rules. I’m lucky gym people wear masks clean everything use also social distance. Since July reopened one person gym exposed. may die hypertension, damned covid gets first, right? :) think things might help-- one COVID going away time soon even life-altering pandemic anymore. means, get sick might still get tested. result better detection flu. 


Two, workplaces schools might keep stricter stay-home policies. policies might flexible still possibilities remote work/learning-- stay home incapacitated, prevent transmission colleagues. everyone this, counterintuitive effect. first seem like people home, implemented correctly fewer people get sick time stay home often. 


Three, mRNA vaccines may game changer COVID. suspect years data in, real downside mRNA vaccines approved viruses. ""used to"" flu still health emergency kills plenty people (and animals) every year. one quite stark contrast alot ""good news"" post seeing although good news could simply calm storm.

With Moderna Pfizer developing vaccine South African variant, combined people getting fatigued quarantining winter freeze last week, suspicion get combination good bad news.

We probably see uptick cases come March April Summer comes around cases may slow due warmer weather possible third dose vaccine rollout.

But anything happen point, individuals take great vigilance Something like 40-50% US deaths nursing homes. research using 5% test positivity cutoff whether high transmission not. chance I’m wearing mask working out. gym open since June 2020 hasn’t indication spread. 90% members don’t wear masks. Stop listening fear mongering. also result social distancing already around fact that, quite simply, exponential growth took time america took time reach critical mass. 

It already developing crisis mid March suddenly everything shut week later pushing Manhattan health care limits. kids (at least high school level) neither contract easily spread easily adults. point look combined probabilities. Kids school driver outbreaks. vaccinations widespread, overkill every school undergo multimillion-dollar ventilation upgrades. Especially masks option. Lol international bit gamble hope works jesus christ news sites mission keep us locked long possible. really absolutely disgusting Yes, that's why. many tests means many cases recorded. time last year jump hoops meet ridiculous requirements tested. article says cuts transmission, none. 

That's great vaccinated person transmitting another vaccinated person, since neither die need hospitalized. 

Non-vaccinated people need still careful around *everyone*. feel bad last people vaccinated country. Vaccinated people care people get Covid-19, least got *their* lives back. Human nature guess. Looking visceral reactions told hold longer, doubt compassion last remaining people waiting vaccinated. shit! pick sushi, there's Orangetheory next door. looks like 20sq ft. Place tiny. Absolutely one wearing masks they're huffing puffing exercises. course major source spread missing point. people extend pandemic.

What saying vaccines, would need catch pandemic end. means allowing population slowly get infected without overwhelming hospitals.

And anybody says Australia New Zealand solved lockdowns, reason strategy worked vaccines catching super early still contact traceable. vaccines, would also need let population catch it. ""Follow data! (Except data disagrees desire keep locked down.)"" I'm disappointed provincial government mandating masks gyms. seems like logical thing do. sounds super politically non-biased /s It’s “magic” dense fruitcake. lack knowledge understanding reason say “fuck it” 

New variants emerge. already have. happened influenza virus, also caused deadly pandemic 100 years ago - people still die flu every year, enough lockdowns. There’s wealth scientific knowledge informing us respond cause least harm. situation temporary. dont know caused though let's remember assume covid I’m worried won’t able to, may discovered it’s dangerous mix vaccines you’re stuck whatever initially get. allowed touch faces yet? I’ve itch nose 8 months. God, hope conference really address difficult decisions need made. one shitshow biased, narrow thinking sides. Virtually one thinks disease disappear. signs pointing becoming endemic seasonal, like influenza.  example, World Health Organization recommended May percent positive remain 5% least two weeks governments consider Tragic. Every death tragic. /r/influenza tend ignore kinds stories, unfortunately.  two people hung inside outside lockdown, least took upon understand risks mask free, social distanced indoors. either felt sick came contact positive case, steered clear good. balance risk hanging worth reward isolated year. decided worth it. wasn’t flippant decision. 2.5% hospitalized? idiot obviously wrong, number kids died virus extremely, extremely small. There’s still alot people don’t even know masks work Shits open dude. need permission go sit outdoors eat. feel like outrage little overblown. two articles I've se,en looks like outbreaks workout classes gym typical weightlifting treadmill use. Sure, gyms could cautious even two (?) outbreaks entire year coronavirus look like gyms big spreaders. ""We ignored safety advice gather 20 people got it, one died. Therefore I'm going ignore 500,000 people dead say big deal, time get back living (except dead people)""   This. leaving doors open beginning school year told can't safety event school shooter. ended buying purifier HEPA filter classroom instead. 1. Broken link.  
2. splash park doesn’t mean anything Agreed. guy pos, he's wrong. NJ's tiered system ridiculous New York's even worse I'm hearing friends co-workers. 

Elderly healthcare workers first, without question, everyone else regardless. get vaccinated anyway. chastisement ""line skipping"", ""cheating system"", teachers NJ, instance, send strongly worded letters Governor get ""on list"" like effing night club? 

No thanks. Stop moralizing order gets GET JABS ARMS QUICKLY POSSIBLE. amount energy breath wasted tiering totally absurd. Link example virus traveling corridors rooms? seen examples well six feet within same, poorly ventilated room, I've never heard traveling rooms. Gyms closed 4 months fucking depressing Hope it’s like website find get tested. Please update us. hope continue feel fine. Hungary even worse: yesterday, highest since mid-Dec. (17,19% positivity rate, +483 hospitalized) cat gets poo stuck booty aaaaahhh time time let guard down. far over. several countries Europe Middle East already climbing early winter surge much like saw. countries reporting high prevalence UK variant. 

The UK variant doubling every 10 US spite significant reduction overall cases. Even variants die US, fact UK variant doubling every 10 days cause concern. looking argument. I’ve managed family owned gym. one staff, making $12/hr cleaning pube central elliptical machines. They’re scrubbing sweat stains walls treadmills really scrubbing anything hard. wipe surfaces disinfectant sprays. assistant manager would spend extra time shift vacuuming gross shit one wants acknowledge. Gyms truly Petri dish bacteria. think people get it. yet hear single *confirmed* festival event Chicago year, normally hundreds summer. People apply permits 6+ months been, absolutely word allowed. Events take time plan. There’s slight chance might able schedule appointment next week, doesn’t work I’ll wait May thing place I’m sure. told back normal eliminated Covid eminent zero Covid professors? 
Almost like little built immunity, small outbreaks spread speed... It’s Pepsi vaccines.

“Is 2/3 chance won’t get sick ok?” Yup, even asymptomatic people end getting long term damage. Sorry, J&amp;J shot isn’t good enough want it. I've wearing KF94s teacher US love them. I've felt relatively safe I'm pregnant anymore, getting buying air purifier HEPA filter classroom. that's going typical set up, since obtained myself. (My brother lives Korea sent KF94s really plentiful there).  school HVAC system? Good lord    kind seems like easier fix (just make windows open) expensive HVAC filtration upgrades.  honest, that’s probably I’m getting downvoted oblivion, government/hospital hacks trying keep peace don’t want hear logical dissenting opinions.

Well don’t think it’s really deep rabbit hole, think people pissy they’re desperate get back sense normalcy they’ll take whatever get. God forbid disagree. I’m perfectly comfortable holding something better protect myself. Lol never double mask grocery store that’s pre vaccine baseline I’d wait couple weeks starts kicking don’t think need rule regulation officials tendencies approve. think covid combined social media given people feeling it’s time shine. (Look socially conscious am! Look creative am! Look adaptable am!.. don’t even get started super-moms post pictures smiling kids “homeschool.”) seems like big competition don’t want see end. Take look people replying you. culture messaging, it’s hard understand people lashing out. O'rly? wonder still putting guy tv claiming herd immunity via infection pandemic ‘will January one way other,’ says former FDA chief Scott seen videos Chinese hazmat suits disinfecting streets?

As turns propaganda really effective. according UK's plan. restrictions removed June 21st. It’s constant bad news hasn’t good news. thought would 500k plus dead US millions around world COVID time last year? 

The pessimists continually right optimists continually wrong. surely hope vaccinate pandemic, cannot sure, there’s many new variants around. hurr hurr great contribution, no, there's uncontained plague mean, look [requirements start easing lockdown it’s pretty clear goal COVID. They’ve said nothing easing restrictions hit vaccination milestones; one metric matters new cases. So, COVID dangerous 20 something university student, can’t go gym vulnerable population opportunity vaccinated? university talking another online Winter 2021/2022 semester?

Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  business infrastructure disbanded, organizational knowledge disappears people find new work, becomes increasingly difficult (bordering impossible) try turn things back get going like business shut duration. 

Businesses need many things working together concert profitable bunch links broken it’s really fucking difficult put pieces back together - it’s crazy mix hard work time sheer luck start business keep failing good times say nothing now.

Jobs businesses absolutely come back, won’t before. Exactly. Losers trying spin vices virtues since start pandemic. Annoying see. good editorial think lot people become really invested taking 0 risk can't want differentiate risks approach zero actual zero.  That's outdated advice anyway. bootcamps, sure, decent chance teaching development skills studying core CS fundamentals getting break places *so* much competition now. companies want CS degree that, years experience position obtained somewhere else. true entry level positions beyond internships, mostly reserved college students occasionally bootcamp grads. live people used say ""this government conspiracy"" rarely anyone wears mask even time remove talk. surprised case rise. Well.... still get virus even vaccinated. CDC says website. Mr Fauchi said too. said today cnn another variant California, New York, Africa etc. may protect you. I’ve bad case it, it’s horrible. still months later. won’t stop neither vaccines. It’s masks tents kids school out. Thanks China. variants discussed more? Especially p1 Brazil variant could render vaccines useless get booster vaccine. I'm concerned this, reminds February 2020 covid thing, really taken seriously. fact leaders (Fauci, Biden, etc.) even STARTED put reopening plan

Wait...what's closed? closed, Biden power ""Wear masks change behaviors"" 

It probably soon change ""wear masks avoid crowds normal things"". simply lie average. among highest numbers RIGHT europe remembers ""twindemic"" days sub? Seems unlikely, lasting effect influenza prevalence would silver lining storm cloud pandemic. close months. early January sky rocketing. getting closer though know summer better.  really wish government would get onboard “Mile 23 marathon” messaging. would help lot. loves attention. Biden still boss could tell cool while, would best us. True enough greater good can’t say “yes?” need hedge every positive statement idea still risk isn’t fully encouraged?

Because still risk every kind activity every situation fully encouraged. know well safe nuanced contingent many things can't boiled sentence. like message mean true people telling wrong. 

I seen throughout pandemic, certain people needing absolutes. soon happened people needed absolute date would over, would get vaccine, vaccines would work, virus would mutate etc... 

Well unfortunately reality rarely times predict future. Doctors scientists really position make absolute statements unprecedented global pandemic. best, hedge statements, ultimately people lose shit can't accept ambiguity. 

It's group people yell weatherman expect able forecast week advance going rain BBQ. People love little weather apps say ""look says 9% percip 76 hours now, we'll fine"" magic computer algorithm making guesses data now. People want virus. difference weather apps kill people rains BBQ, people die make wrong absolute statements virus. Exactly. hopefully pandemic brings awareness future construction designing cost efficiency short sighted. Designing school office HVAC systems reducing disease transmission whether Covid-19, flu Covid-20 mind priority. would happy pay extra school taxes janitor kids school could crank recirculation flu season hits. 

The entire energy star LEED system really lead us unintended path designing energy optimization health. 100% agree everything say antibodies already still wear mask, noone else gym does. buncha idiots life still understand China, country billion people one major control outbreak. one.

You're telling keep eye every single rural village every shack middle nowhere.

How even among authoritarian countries, ones clamp go back normal? 


Sorry point nailing people reminded that. Here's way thinking it. grandmother lived great depression every stop making sure always full pantry making sure ate everything plate?

This thing ever leave minds fully. Trauma persists. hope end pandemic, best shown world lift finger help others. hope incapable spreading virus incapacitation learn personally capable of. I’m lawyer.

Depending job, you’re paid those, labor laws may violated. It’s worth educating yourself.

Also, you’re salary, hourly rate mentally calculated 60 hours now, 40.

A lot jobs trash it’s okay look new one you’re still current one.

Better jobs Last summer pretty good it, too. Though ya knows year since people getting tired it, tourists dont often go along it. Hopefully vaccine rollout keeps going strong. really bad results likely seriously I'm realistic Smarmy op eds existed long covid, know people obsess covid ones. still smarmy op eds covid too. mid-February back \~20 confirmed cases US. I'm pretty sure caught concert January 30th. mom neighbor January.

The numbers early hot garbage.

If it, felt like someone took slegehammer chest. coughs would come every 30 minutes despite trying suppress them, pain coughs. 3 weeks, woke middle night agony rolled over. took 2.5 months pain stop. really want it. OP, disagree. predictions predictably hysterically wrong models completely - refuse look actual infection distribution curves making predictions. 

There significant evidence exposure coronaviruses - SARS, common cold - offers cross-immunity. Depending population, that's 20% 40%, borne enclosed infections like Diamond Princess (only 20% boat got sick). Variants going cause massive surge that's normal development viral infections. hundreds variants influenza rhinovirus (for example) without results swine flu-like epidemics every months. ? non-news. quit gym! Plus one wore mask! been. dr. fauci saying “outdoors rather indoors” months. consistently rattling list six eight simple constraints since april. issue there's talk ""endgame."" 

Climate scientist here...I've got bad news next crisis going go that's requirement public needs.

I mean deep respect: seems seeking type answer religions speak to. Answering question ""How cope uncertainty ongoing difficulty?"" scientists tell you. think they're ruling anything right now.

We really awful Winter cases deaths. Lol. find paper HIV science finished? 
Critical thinking seems dying out. less poor life choices fact likely hospitalized covid likely burden added problems like able lift easily, turn over, ect. Many probably happy circumstances got bumped caring difficult. country also concerned adenovirus 5 vector used [Sputnik V] shot, previous studies appeared make people susceptible HIV infection old gym members spending extra 5 minutes cleaning equipment thoroughly class flaunt like they're safe hygiene precautions.

I keep thinking actually \*far worse\* people lingering room breathing other's sweat air much longer. national lockdown, somewhat real, extended planned lockdown, Brazil playing regional light lockdowns curfews. That's variant spreading country (Brazil) easily. 655,000 Americans die heart disease year

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Nope. Government inept getting people approved them.

Believe me, Germans utterly frustrated government moment. Man remember sitting dinner hearing Tom hanks got started pulling basketball teams court like maybe shouldn’t dinner waiter made joke like “our margaritas strong enough cure corona” last time ate sneaking suspicion, grounded truth, _years_ ill effects pandemic. Rent mortgage moratoriums hiding tons bad debt.  Companies learned working home viable crash commercial real estate, endanger mass transit secondary businesses (restaurants, couriers, etc.)

At time good portion middle/upper class saved ton money spending discretionary items (entertainment, travel) go good time, sense reality economic inequality aggravated.

Things health front getting much better relatively quickly deferred dealing secondary issues going cause ongoing problems. canceled major chain membership started re-opening summer, shocked retention attempt; even *helped* cancel membership waiving requirement written notice There's also big difference addicted bad news, EXPECTING bad news.

Many trust things get better seemingly rarely does. That’s Connecticut least opted age based approach. yellow tape vague definitions would delay vaccination effort. mention including essential workers preexisting conditions like diabetes, obesity hypertension would capture majority population anyway flood overload system. Age brackets easy check honestly strongest predictor. pretty simple data vaccinated match testing medical interventions. sayin people that's do... already caught masks trying pass old people dressed nurses etc. Riight cuz summer anything...literally everywhere year round entire year still new varients.... highly doubt go away summer...smh scenario described meal vaccinated people. matter interacted outside meal. also matter Fauci thinks people bend rules start interacting non-vaccinated says ""yes"". answer actually ""yes"". interact vaccinated people vaccinated. End story. pass go. You’re you’re analysis backwards.

Their username check's out.   UK SA two ""scary variants"" continue see virus rapidly retreat. suspect we'll school enrollment availability fda approval. They're due huge Sabattical, Ayahusca Iboga guys going busy next years...... October May.

Masks social distancing degrees lockdowns. write paper showing work, methods results. None work published available form though one may preprint server.  think part frustrating part splintered experiences are, leads in-fighting need exist. I'm targeting all, everyone frustrated circumstance extrapolate that. Personally, approve NY handled things, approve many states lived there.  


Anyway, hope let y'all know soon things get better. Thanks kind!  shit load self care too! psychological, emotional, resting help. Serving alcohol already banned 8 p.m, though.

I admit I'm bit confused nightly restrictions. countries nightly curfews make sense me. night owl, better went jog midnight middle day? whole subteddit turned strawmanning circlejerk blaming imaginary people imaginary things one's saying. dramaticize like ""i guess I'm SERIAL KILLER hanging vaccinated mom!"" one's said that. all. Fauci, CDC, people Reddit. Maybe saw dramatic twitter comment something thought applied there's 0 communication concentrated group saying two couples who've vaccinated cant dinner together. 

Did yall expect vaccine release everything normal right away? specific timeline go bar even though idea supply chain look like recently. February. vaccine rollout started late December. We're pretty damn good. deal done earlier UK signed deal.  last school worked EA windows classrooms! first week subbed 3-5th ALS room got terrible headache. could smell mold room. Turns room former lab 4 sinks covered plywood. moldy! insisted come clean drains, etc, trapped rooms nasty chemicals. even open window. Thank goodness changed classrooms right after. still depressing work school without windows sunshine though. thought right we’ll able drop majority restrictions summer pick back fall?? can’t see single scenario would happen successfully. Lancet article month AZ Vaccinations started Vs results Approx 9m vaccinations done far findings Scottish 1m hospitalisations results.

Hmm.. well gee gosh know... Op posts incessantly AZ.

I don’t understand would pay slander vaccine, things.

Edit, course, expensive vaccine makers. nice whataboutism. existence Chinese labor camps producing low-skilled goods relation dubiousness vaccine. two totally different groups working either good. CA public health dept put tweet months ago suggesting exact thing, fortunately mocked relentlessly. Literally one thought actually good idea.

Now college actually enforcing rule? hell? thought college educated people supposed be... know... smart? Ah, makes sense. definitely - shameful. CDC seems taken much realistic approach wrt schools lately, new guidance would suggest lot closed.

The problem schools impact far greater - social developmental impact children, economic impact loss free child supervision school hours, food security evades lot low income households. bottom line - try pretend issue, rather admit front - spreader, one they're willing push extenuating factors. getting small covid sorry  yeah, people listen. tell people everything normal vaccine, run million hit pieces trying convince public variants ignore never everyone every country vaccinated. people tuning reality nothing ever good enough people we're supposed trusting. personally vaccinated, give shit anymore.  Canada Day July 1. think it’s little premature cancel everything.   
Also how’s vaccination going there? Trump actually say would magically disappear. direct reference. year old. evidence ever emerged, I'd expect seen now.   hell bent using science make point, realize numerous studies indicate spread dramatically worse gyms proper precautions. 

You'd also know contact tracing near useless many areas United States better part last months since everything back open. 

This one contact tracing efforts leads back gyms, Redditors target gyms use them. 

Anyone regularly goes gym knows mental impact able work out, let alone shut inside. 

I've always 'tough guy' mentally step foot gym 2/2020-1/2021 holy fucking shit, I've never dark time mentally. sympathize anyone loses escape now. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

You get good shape equipment minimal space.

Equipment make faster/more fun. mandatory necessary get shape. purely luxury. evidence this? Even countries scary variants cases declining around rate are. Looks another excuse ""experts"" go another power trip  pay work? get pay pretty true situation. 

Want attract talented people profession? Pay them. Beatings help improve morale.  conditions increase chance hospitalisation, definitely get hospitalised catch covid-19. data add up. Moms spaghetti totally agree with. People talking long time actually I’ve found WFH convenient overall. cuts commutes greenhouse gases.

Yeah know I’m gonna wear masks winter mostly I’m sick times year. think worn masks even event sick better regulations staying home sick, it’s good learning now. don’t know think many doses. Due storm delays one point entire city 1,000 doses left.  eating affect someone else's hunger. family's ignorance spreads virus throughout community workplace affecting others make poor choices. like weights pants There’s difference bias and... this. Bias unconscious byproduct humans human. conscious effort influencing public. 

Bias hard end. conscious choices quite easy. need news source realize they’re working stated goals.  next winter we'll getting shots new COVID variants instead flu shots? said, I'm surprised see using present-tense verb ""work"" refer relationship place.  Eh something sounds odd. could kid picking parent something haha. least hope. Starting think commenter's car something. People get rightfully upset someone says ""it's flu"". vast majority that, actually less severe flu. covid certainly flu simply small subset severe. scary headlines permanent lung damage etc think pretty overstated. 

I wonder much due fact many young people basically said ""so what, kills old people, care."" Maybe collectively, even subconsciously, started pushing ""severe months-long damage young people"" anecdotes attempt get low-risk people care tens thousands high-risk people dying every day. focus vaccination campaign (possibly elderly) then? Manaus Brazil literally says first top fitness industry trade association member gyms promoting message

In news, Walmart finds pay competitive Bernie Madoff found clients satisfied investment opportunities. comparison pointless - want compare like like based age? Well, might well include factors result disproportional loss, like comorbidities race.

And that's without getting fact one hand taking personal risk, jeopardizing others. stats exclude deaths drunk driving, fraction 38k mentioned. think open season drunk driving personal decision?

Careless analysis emphasis indifference human life, since impact others you. Fantastic. Jesus Christ. would big favor someone comply simple request? Stand yourself. see. Well keep windows open (if weather permits) wear mask yourself. he's avoiding high risk activities careful he's likely infected. 1st dose month ago likely offered protection well, symptoms there's less risk spreading anyways asymptomatic people spread virus readily.

So there's bit risk sure also couple things lower risk, well bit protection vaccine. California variant. appears even scientific community safe ~~believing wants desperately believe times~~ changing conclusions based new data. 

FTFY  better flexible adapt situation changes.

A bit ironic given DeSantis flexing plan changed since beginning.

(I know strictly defending him, I'm going detailed plans still flexible simple plan necessarily mean flexible) vacation dose wearing mask. Yes, overreacting. Question whether they’d willing give one... effects widespread COVID economy? I've always heard we're sacrificing economy save lives. theoretical world everyone completely ignored coronavirus sick go out, would impact economy? Amazing within week new president lockdowns started loosen.....mmmmm? Perhaps traveling hallways, nonetheless spread distanced know located , something like went around (Upstate NY) late 2019 / early 2020. know one person hospitalized it.

&amp;#x200B;

However, know two people got Covid antibody test (including one hosptialized) available turns whatever going around Covid. additional severe respiratory illness going around late 2019/early 2020.  Haha wife's family NY work Healthcare refuse get vaccinated due ""microchips"". wish fucking kidding...

Just illustrate fucked NY, wife driving 400 miles Monday get vaccinated state site. drive 3 weeks after. Imagine able take holiday abroad fat Sure there's evidence - science driving force behind shuttering first restricting afterward. contact tracing - crowdsourcing virus data - fully support (and certain instances), people try play science down.

But yeah, I'm upvotes. So's CDC, really want people like Reddit. Meanwhile, covid variants around world starting seriously take off, transmissibility higher mortality. Either make wear mask pick tell GTFO take uber instead. need make mountain small things. Focus deep things life. majority cases California weeks they're still falling rapidly Lol ventilation school, what's that? feeling pandemic bad many people seeming enjoy good news somehow inherently evil. Like traitor cause justice believe good things possible likely coming soon.

It simple matter pessimism versus optimism. Pessimists problems optimists even though disagree obviously going outliers.  whole family isolating doesn’t sound like tested treated. think made collapse? old high school still asbestos heating system 70s. Rural Pennsylvania February opening windows picture. That's problem blanket open close school proposals. like article starts ""The CDC must...""

The CDC must whatever they, teams scientists access best scientific minds country, deem best. need Jake Tapper Professor Engineering Portland State (seriously, fuck) telling CDC ""must"" do.

That's science works. CDC make recommendations based science, based prevailing public opinion bunch semi-experts. means ever need see clickbait irresponsible headline spreading misconceptions vaccines, sign in. I've inside house year - easy drop lifestyle grew accustomed safe now. even then, still slight chance still getting sick, know sure vaccination means can't still spread it. would rather hang home wife dog, go bar bunch anti-maskers. joked pandemic worsened US ""work first"" mentality. have, pretty damn depressing. also baffled workplace decided pack people office buildings yet mulled travel ban last summer. also around time flexible work home arrangement ended literally decided allow zero work home, baffled me. trying stay safe social distance, part workforce working home? 

Anyways, got worn garbage feel like need month long national holiday unwind this. course, US, probably means work. *pretends shocked* Every news site goal intention. It’s propaganda one way another. Even unbiased new source going filter story whether intentionally unintentionally. comirbidities risk factors hospitalization, would see much higher numbers hospitalization. fraction comorbidities them, really comorbidities. article makes sound like one 3, high chance getting hospitalization. that’s true. still small % chance getting hospitalization. Maybe incrementally higher still low. Agreed—I’ve seen happen firsthand family friends Colorado California. They’ve doctor nurse friends call say, “Hey, can’t tell general public, extra doses going one. Come get vaccine.”  Lol Time step r/HVAC Hopefully society learn stay isolated cubes connect via Zoom day. could eradicate contagious disease! welcome! pick up? Cmon people. Stop pushovers. car, rules. Berlin mayor said. Whoever refuses vaccine due picky goes end queue. Open possibility get ""unwanted"" vaccines general public watch disappear minutes. Thing is, knowing german love bureaucracy following stupid rules without question, probably close impossible. no, sounds normal. bad kind normal, still normal. keeping sick kids school sick parents office. Kids breeding grounds germs 100%. Good guys. I’m family therapist specialize working children adolescents. I’ve extremely anxious schools since second happened reasons mentioned. said, tried focused managing concerns knowing factors also consider and, since horrible new situation, needed trust experts allow time figure out. evidence surfaced absolutely undeniable schools stayed open open since August. article mentions, apparently keeping schools open would reduce harm approach. Sadly conversation changed closing schools “slow spread” opening schools means “risking lives” and, course, everything got political. Hindsight 2020 (ironically) but, I’m confident look back huge failure public school leadership every level. I’m saying vindictively. believe public education one important public services country offers. It’s absolutely essential. I’ve lost lot sleep night stressing long term consequences schools (let alone children!!) occur result.   ever ran $200 treadmill. things going suck. pandemic started, area passed school levy update HVAC systems schools. (Work done.)

That's right, ventilation bad voters even noticed. teachers campaigning smell feet farts classrooms. school district buildings windows open, buildings built 2000's (most them) central heating air.

Here format proposed:
Spread elementary schoolers among half-size classes elementary MS buildings. Lunch classrooms. Recess classroom-designated part schoolyard.

Use HS buildings middle school classes, half-size, cohorts attend in-person/online hybrid, perhaps two-week cycle, depending recommendations regarding incubation periods?

Then high schoolers asynchronous, online classes like colleges (in case work job supplement family income, one family computer), classes labs use building colleges mostly operating in-person. gym space designed handle much air passing either. That’s 10+ higher volume Covid germ air spewed potentially, reason mask definitely required.  Also nursing home patients exactly known low turnover. Even without pandemic think average stay nursing home around year. I'm one tbh. I'll go many parties/festivals possible over. Probably 'just' 93m infected far according best sub US? Conflating read articles scientific consensus mistake. Uhhh incivility automod kinda sucks. hahah. 2 gym memberships covid. (Different classes avaliable each). 
One requires masks 100% time, limited occupancy, temp checks, encouraged social distancing hand washing, strick policies staff quarantine potential exposure cases. people know frequent gym/employees gotten it. 

The gym free all. mask requirements, temp checks... went once, feel safe canceled membership. 

I know sucks work mask getting covid probably worse. I’ve saying almost year now.... Ya think lot people focus death count goal, really we're looking death something like 5-10 years someone's life lockdown months everyone's life lost. Really, since government decided anything order get cases 0, we're world trying minimize amount wasted life, death count. BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said Thursday EU allowing exports COVID-19 vaccines, mostly BionTech/Pfizer Moderna, United States Britain mechanism block them.

Von der Leyen told news conference approximately 95% EU-made vaccines exported since Jan. 30 manufactured Pfizer BioNTech, remainder Moderna.

She said honouring supply contracts EU therefore limitation export, AstraZeneca’s exports EU keeping “a close eye” company’s shortfalls deliveries 27-nation bloc.

I would also add every COVID breach Australia's hotel quarantine system (and many) [due ventilation virus travels air corridors rooms, ventilation system neighboring rooms.

It's big fucking important factor. critical safety measure masks. First time life I've seen Wales described 'jingoistic'! idea covid deaths unacceptable types death shrugged one things struggle understand many people’s mindsets pandemic. Lifting heavy isn’t option getting exercise mental physical health- you’re talking wants, needs. “People recovered coronavirus vaccinated likely able fight variant off, there’s doubt that.” added “they may get little bit sick it.”

Cool, vaccines still work super fortunate able access April one week gym actually answering emails, I'm BSC *not* make easy. suspect may agreed cancel sent credit card letter state Attorney General, credit card put block gym. Well, no, close enough. Anyway, problem kids spread vulnerable people. still think open schools, improving ventilation like definitely worth doing. UK worked closely manufacturers early good job contractual terms. Even so, shortage doses constraint vaccination programme. love see comments posts negged anymore. media shit. time weed worst start promoting best. CNN already felt it. Fox News started shit since democrat office. need way know unbiased fair reporting. I'm defending media whole right now. They're terrible. post Georgia specifically. Georgia weather issues last week one morning may black ice hours. Otherwise typical cool, wet week.  Well that, best geographical situation nearly every country planet Oxford vaccine used most, homegrown one. People wary cuz hyperbolic, antivax, sensationalism reporting Oxford Covaxin vaccines mainstream media.  live low density areas, masks outside makes sense

NYC? Nah new wave, small blip. vaccination program kill significant new wave (from April onwards). obviously? slightly, mostly due testing/reporting delays due winter storms? Pretty sure know answer  wonderfully constructed response child's retort lol That’s thing, isn’t it? We’ve told since beginning isn’t going away without vaccine. there’s vaccine (a few!) goalposts moved again. It’s mentally exhausting. It’s hard optimistic. 2/3 Swedes already worked home part week, source this? Sounds highly unbelievable think this? hard say look different country.

I really speak Austria, think viable solution would return normal senior citizens risk groups vaccinated. 

This viable reasonable timeframe. Herd immunity not. Everyone wants save planet AC 66 drive Escalade. Nothing new. It’s easy something don’t want sacrifice anything. hard.. absolutely done. requires lot personal-responsibility focused effort. (I kind see old phrase:.. ""If important you, make priority"")

I caught Corona back March-April 2020.. ended spending 38 days (total) Hospital ,. 16 days ICU Ventilator. lost 12lbs muscle atrophy even sit/stand/walk. Took 12 days re-learn walk. hospital discharge, oxygen tank 24-7 home month, .and 2 medications (blood thinners heart stabilizers) 6 months. 

But slowly got fitness. live small apartment (around 380sq feet). carved corner living room big enough yoga stretching in. get 4:30am, feed cat,. try pound 30 45min yoga stretching. also started small walks (sometimes downstairs mailbox back.. end street back. around block. kept slowly building longer longer, eventually without oxygen tank. 

That's almost year ago now,. I'm currently averaging per day:

* around 7 miles walked

* around 15,000 steps

* burning average 1,200 Active calories per day (total around 3,500 4,500 calories burned entire day)

* averaging around 100 min exercise per day

I'm Day 244 consecutively closing Apple Activity Rings.. get 365 Award sometime Late June. I've seen cases hospitalizations declining vaccinated population offset rising cases younger unvaccinated population. I'd ok government actually outlined ""unacceptable"" was. infectious? deadly? widespread? We've pandemic year one even suggested metrics guide public policy. based president governor health official's feeling. That's unacceptable. I’ve never heard anyone involved logistics say it’s better plan. gym one day week prior covid (they 50 min class Monday nights went somewhat consistently).

That said, found joining online gym helped motivated. recently, we've Ring Fit Adventures, fun definitely motivational game-loving partner.  Yeah I'm afraid government officials actually enjoying power trip ""experts"" risk averse would ban human activity could, governments really taking lead undoing year's worth restrictions frantically put place. summer comes around one going bother security theater.

It going mad dash go stuff, less places said stuff at. remaining places going say fuck maximize can. Evidence increasingly saying case. Israel case study shows vaccine stops infection also transmission. You’ve seen studies show people don’t wear masks narcissistic lack empathy concern others? Whats point reporting things effect populace negative ways? people need know threatens tool survival. world dangerous place grateful live nation given tons information. like watch turn simple. paranoid. Fortunately, ways exercise doesn’t involve heavy weights. yeah, keep busy exercise hold weights safe do. traveling Summer. wait 2-3 weeks second dose fine. That's vaccine for. working since august, always wear mask vaccinated. like go. otherwise, get it. refuse believe kind sizeable amount people like/enjoy this. large extended social circle side job, know single person never come contact anyone like this. socially distanced tea 2 friends weeks ago sat cried much miss able go things together travel plans cancel, etc. emotional people. husband spectrum isolation lack freedoms gotten (saying stereotype people spectrum emotions, part he's pretty stoic). even broken him, believe we're bad guys here.

I admit people trying ""freedoms"" wanting live life extended entire situation. feeling start would drag can't tell help longevity. We’re seeing thing state level mostly continuity, also lot direct control people’s day day lives, don’t really see good excuse. Bears, Beets, Battlestar Gallactica. weekly average pretty much stable showing slight downward trend past days, stark contrast collapse witnessed January. Still early tell anyway.

Especially since one person wider circle friends/acquaintances gotten covid. know one single person. Makes feel less real.

Pretty much everything live closed unavailable anyway, have. mind, think weird people pro-restrictions actually restrict lives much.  No, not. never get magic 70% vaccination rate? new variant emerges? spend next ten years hiding? Completely delusional fear strains gonna get worse, merge strains gonna common.  Completely agree ""lets pick one sector actually benifits physical mental health"" mention mortality rate people dying Covid physically unfit people, saying immune getting physical fit would sure increase chances fighting virus. Thank you! This. exactly. Yesterday Biden photo opportunity Oval visiting officials. N95 cloth mask it, literally couldn’t understand word said. know trying lead example, optics good considering fully vaccinated well month now. point needs take mask off, closer six feet VP, say “we able fully vaccinated miracle modern medicine...you without fear also fully vaccinated!”

Acceptance would increase overnight. predict every possibility right. Christmas, UK variant 2 % capital city area cases, already 40 %. Susan Parish Council? go grocery store? Public transportation? Work?

If not, good you. You’re privileged. Don’t berate people understand severity follow precautions can. Even DC area, masks outside current guidance fairly well complied with. course nobody expects youre yourself/household park away everyone else, ya general thems rules.  Many NYC heating systems designed 20s 30s drastically oversized expected people open windows run heat max winter prevent spread future pandemic 1918 Spanish flu. Interesting. That’s backwards CDC recommended states do. Though thankful got shot, feel weird knowing got coworkers risk simply quicker computer. It’s shame things going slow. feel like gyms safe long follow CDC guidelines religiously. personally gym rat yet return.  Basically invested home equipment gotten really used working home. shall see...... Measles maybe? that’s reason public health officials lie telling go whatever want without care world.

bullshit. know there's difference public health officials saying ""become full antimasker wear masks grocery store,"" ""you're safe virus, feel free hang vaccinated people potentially go bars restaurants, however, cognizant possibility spreading continue wearing masks public places."" They're saying neither things seem best convince people there's benefit vaccine. know does? convinces average 35 year old knows risk little take vaccine. ""swing voters"" vaccine uptake, vaccine puts unease bc believe little risk want get back normal. started beginning casting vaccine free pass normal life, ifs buts it? Sure, possible might result extra deaths fact could transmit, would outweighed far people getting much fewer deaths result. don’t mind. People frustrated. They’re gonna mad. hope way soothe people bit longer actually put thing bed. Lol san Diego particularly weird since could, almost daily, allow outdoor use. saw ton cycling orange theory classes outdoors made perfect sense. 

And feels like everywhere socal retractable walls make like garage door don’t think nation citizens wearing N95s. Yeah shit eh. There's common sense (with long conversation common actually is;) there's liability. Nothing obligates stop independent living resident moving interacting whomever wish, service care contract assisted living may obligate such; without assurance vaccine 100% going protect residents catching Covid, legal representatives may told staff keep restrictions state federal government gives clear, get sued case 100% effective someone's grandchild brings residences. told wrong.

Pfizer said 6 weeks fine, CDC says maximum interval shots.

The study done short interval study would finish quickly, would ideal interval.

See ""additional say closed anywhere comment. solely talked consequences peoples' actions. affect people themselves. moderna shot   Click bate fake news omg. OP choose wrong title. article gyms without mask wearing. gym go fine. mask times. clean machine work out. big worry J&amp;J vaccine whole time. awesome vaccine society-wide level, sucks individual level. protect enough let go back living normal life, defeats whole point vaccine young, healthy people. I'm already worried hospitalized dying almost zero risk already. want able go eat go concerts without worrying killing someone's grandma.

I guess stop talking though best interest lots people get J&amp;J vaccine wait Pfizer Moderna one become available. people read times fat, colored hair, nose ring type associate CNN brand panic inducing race baiting. surprise they'd run anti-exercise piece.  WOW SHIT! mean virtually 0 testing last March compared now. don’t think compare numbers face value like really close stepping foot 1 rainy day weekend. appreciate civil discourse, thank agree, that’s also price happening election year. 11 months one rhetoric new administration trying figure unscrew mistakes before, set realistic goals crush, make sure don’t relapse. It’s really fair look continuity. declining significantly, 50% since start February.  Hence things sound like ridiculous overkill

I totally get saying seems like public health professionals country caught Catch 22 speak-

They can't say something certain, hedge side extreme caution. Meanwhile, people dumb, continued hysteria eventually fades background begin discount, even distrust, public health messaging. 

It's thing double masking message- theory (and fact) better one, ridiculous ""sky falling"" concept everyone laughed off.

There needs better connection ""best"" ""reasonable"". Pfizer says 6 weeks fine, CDC says maximum interval. get links, they're big comment want look. filter, less effective. wet mask less permeable winds shunting air around mask unfiltered. 

A wet mask also continue protect around keeping wet stuff coming mouth flying air around you. moved away home shortly pandemic. haven’t seen family year now. mom lives alone scheduled get second dose vaccine couple weeks. wait three weeks second dose, would irresponsible go visit still? didn’t go home Christmas Thanksgiving that’s everyone said do, don’t know rule vaccinated. vaccinated. live gf first dose. family seeing would outdoors. Another good question many shots end year average human need. agree ventilation needs upgraded schools. part living. obsticals are: cheap. Really cheap add hazardous material remediation like asbestos walls, upgrading electrical, gas plumbing systems service new equipment. probably blow mind, projects around $100k per classroom. classrooms poor ventilation older ones. Lots bring code repair. Also, takes long time get projects going. need plan september get equipment ordered december hopefully job July building empty. air quality important, best thing short term would air purifying systems classrooms. made purchase quickly install fas fairly painless. know you’re eager put behind you, that’s reason public health officials lie telling go whatever want without care world.

Straw man alert. winner is..

DUH! awesome, I’ve going work every day since mid April, amount stress shoulders getting Moderna vaccine significant. ready get back normal older white/middle class people, young. Ask Covid nurse they’ll tell young people hospital Covid overwhelmingly POC. Chicago here. gym since last fall. caught Covid. Gym buddy caught wife, caught father law, Pastor.

Wear mask, make sure quality one. touch face wear mask need adjust constantly. fine. Seatbelts make difficult communicate people see facial expressions.

It's impossible make masks dehumanizing. Millions years evolution trained us feel faces important social contexts. dickheads like world fucked. wear mask because... freedom. isolate tell do? Karen call manager told wear mask plane. also kicked plane still refuse wear mask. Get fucking common sense. bullshit conspiracy theory fucking novel. shit real killing people. young healthy give shit nobody cares die anyway, kill people around might susceptible due health concerns. Get fucking life, troll! accomplishment Trump million day, accomplishment Biden things 1.3 million. 100% credit goes researchers personnel studied hard school, became great scientists, developed vaccines. bureaucrats deserve credit party loyalists give bureaucrats brag pathetic stolen valor people wear medals battles never fought in. year finally hug fully vaccinated mom?

It funny pandemic made *hugging moms* important. Like would much concern pandemic.

That restricted, people start paying attention to. paranoid bit uncalled for. We're literally year pandemic. FL CA took opposite approaches. FL close entire state down, vunerable-disproportionately impacted group populations, basically beating Cali NY every metric. realize FL governor R-word, care people, politics. Sheesh, talk arguing semantics one. take take vacation days. impact exactly giving 5 extra vacation days. Whilst achieved highly admirable, everyone's situation, motivation accessibility different. never get high proportion population working unless terms people biting head voiced concern gyms open... can't true!   /s

I feel like common sense gone window COVID. course body fluids heavy breathing indoor area, even masks (doubtful 100% compliance), going cause issue.  I’ve going gym NYC. required update air filtration, everyone required wear mask limit amount lockers available, tell people distance.

Everyone following rules see people time. Don’t know anyone exposed gym yet. 

I agree close quarters fitness classes maskless people idiotic idea. Even maskless open area gym idiotic. people follow precautions, likely fine. different going grocery store take public transportation. talk incoming fourth wave reinstitute preventative measures fall, I’m feeling pretty hopeless lately. seemed like news getting better while. flu shot never worked like that. ones get child completely different. pretty dense sure hope one takes vaccine advice you. USA vaccinated stop spread like people surmise, say wait 3-4 months? never ending cycle true (spoiler: not) vaccines end pandemics. really miss gym, wish could get damn vaccine appointment Humans think helps children well.

[Probably went exercise class day received positive test result indicating infected, day after.

I mean, amount social distancing face mask rules going save people like these. Nah, it’s good analogy. 

AZ 100% effective preventing severe infection death. even *do* get infected (despite ~65% efficacy preventing infection entirely) *worst* experience mild moderate symptoms. 

In words, means COVID infections severe fatal. Analogously, “turns COVID common cold”, /r/de_Iama yesterday guy working Bielefeld vaccination site, telling us many people leaving hear vaccinated AZ hope chance get BionTech next appointment. provided photo staff pass token trustworthiness, provide similar back claim? Fran Lebowitz talked something Sen. Patrick Moynihan told asked promote arts. answer, ""Outlaw it.""

Real artists find way.  can’t mandates without skeptics, either; mandate requires skeptics supporters. everyone already wore mask voluntarily, need mandate. diff everyone bro. never personally knew anyone died Flu. personally knew 3 people passed covid. hard understand - Covid leading cause death December January sense “preventable.” need reread comment. Currently work nursing home decade ago. cherry picking comment get want instead intelligent conversation. Hospitals caught red-handed inflating number Covid deaths. That's pretty common knowledge. choose believe whatever facts want I'll choose believe whatever facts want. “Numbers” 2020 inaccurate. Look deaths they’re eerily similar time. Besides obvious physical health benefit opening gyms, gyms also serve peoples mental health well. ""therapy"" corny sounds. think safest place open, said 90 percent people gym likely die heart disease COVID. risk people want come workout choice, yours. Except ""leading COVID data scientist"", GIS data entry person. concerns among others, instance, tested positive today, went two days later recheck tested positive again, state counted first positive test, second. think that's reasonable policy, accused DeSantis ""coverup"".

As arrest- know whole story, point fact, actually illegal, legal ramifications breaking law. despise way police conduct types operations actually much different typical behavior. Texas also dead last number shots distributed government per person. Total failure Texas, hot spot, allocated least fair share vaccines. It’s hard draw conclusions comparing places don’t require masks. Nothing 100% safe. idea fully vaccinated asymptomatic person going spread another fully vaccinated person pass highly unlikely stop messaging it. least half million people dead Covid alone one year, you’re bleating it’s “just cold”. What’s like, breathtakingly ignorant? NY Times others churning alerts, headlines, etc. ""outbreaks"" locations humans go. point gyms particular add long list places people go may carry virus.

Gyms healthy activities first places get people back to. Improving overall health society going happen hiding homes. 200 bucks. entire discussion misrepresented argument kids back school. care grandma getting sick possibility, Timmy's education way important. 

So question is, kids teachers risk covid. answer pretty resounding no. Odds there's sti boom open flood gates young let em back into; bars/pubs/events? Almost like pays good relationship big business. know, thing kids reddit always complain US having?

""The US pockets corporations!"" 

Well gee, who's US' pocket now? I’ve noticed lol :(  Pfizer supposed supply Canada Michigan plant US fucked us that. Trump Biden. Friday first day going back normal stuff, 7 days waiting Pfizer second shot up, going gym gonna go get lunch dinner sit restaurants.

I’m honestly pretty scared though. I’ve retrain brain much adjust people public threats, lot anxiety sitting restaurant unmasked around unmasked people.

I’m still really looking forward it. imagined would like switch flipping head ready excited going back normal, doesn’t feel like all. Become worlds best boxer? Everyone says they've got flu they've actually got cold.

THIS. much. last year Facebook feed chockfull ""no worries, another flu"" shaking damn head. many Americans skip flu shot, get one bad cold year figure ""oh guess flu"". symptoms similar one ""stuffy nose &amp; sneezing day""

I kinda way got no-kidding flu one year &amp; knocked ass 3 solid days. phrase ""it's another flu"" put yellow alert; ""oh shit oh MUCH WORSE flu"" put red around single live Florida, data comparatively good (more vaccines arms per capita states), governor Ron DeSantis horrible job. published plan except draft back October. released plans reopening (last summer) fabricated totally arbitrary political nonsense targets instead science. meet even targets, gave announced reopening anyway. skipped steps plan already ridiculously weak. He's ignoring literally mocking CDC whatever wants, nobody knows priority list is. essential workers wait here. literally even know they're list. Actually, even know *is* list. clearly hurrying fuck up. don’t think Broadway could sell tickets even outrageous cost charge limited run socially distanced plays ballet opera? still enough rich people New York could possible something.  pay thousand dollars year gym membership? Still makes 3rd highest americas basically par european countries. That's shitting bed  Every time go back gym issue

Of course think union cares employer. super spreader event looking Tampa? 2 weeks right? 

And Florida need help Federal government distributing vaccine? read going well already. yes like UK made deal vaccine company share data variants make multi variant vaccines needed &amp; contracted buy 60 million pending safety effectiveness approval

EU making vaccine deals saying refuse old version vaccine get one new strains well.

hopefully USA countries looking backup plans like this. hope variants get milder point finding problems looks like right weak ones might unable get toe hold infectiousness variants concern spreading badly :( It’s certainly effective it, 95%. said anti body levels remain needed neutralize Fever, myalgia, sore arm, swelling injection site, redness injection site, chills headache 48 hour period.

I'd encourage going part, particularly children. Running, climbing, playing around outside like really fundamental parts children develop physical, academic, mental well-being. Resistance all-or-nothing thing.

Let's say want go concert tickets $5. mom gives $20 evening. bully comes along steals $10 you. still enough money buy ticket still go concert (but another bully steals another $10 trouble).

The money antibodies, mom vaccine, ticket price much neutralizing antibodies need order prevent illness (this analogy simplified get idea). real. Adjust workout. Lower weight reps can't it. Get comfortable idea uncomfortable. follow rules work home. dont dare shut gyms That’s exactly is. Survivors guilt, like mourning, isn’t limited situations involving loss life. It’s like there’s part brain labeled “only use case death” I've never quite wrapped head around many people opposed mask-wearing

They're greasy oil traps glued face 8 hours day. disgusting. cares. life go back normal depends close densely packed people sidewalks are. you’re breathing heavy within 10 ft people, it’s courtesy least put light weight mask.... otherwise person may over-reacting, people wont do.  Fair enough.

In Scotland, 'lets privatise everything dismantle state' type conservatives relatively hard find even within Conservative Party present. some, nobody really listening them. home grown vaccine used data yet complete choice vaccine get.

People wary.  know. Pfizer something like primary efficacy trial, idea AZ.

For Pfizer gradual. jumped day 14, really enough people granular that. Israel may get good data. paid bots too. clear misinformation campaign No, not. go back socializing let rip vaccine whether government likes not. Hence “just about”
Sorry, know you’re trying get rise people.

Get fuck outta that. That’s nonsense. too. tears.... Extra asbestos! sure you’d get downvoted saying thing others said...🤷‍♂️ mind must funny place.

Well, info around 6 months ago. looking past information today trying judge it. Which, y'know...No. can't that.

The ability constantly test find cases spreading, also give confidence awareness people virus. Instead helplessly avoid, one could possibly least SOMETHING it.

This useful tool vaccine rolls vaccine. almost everyone country. company offers awesome vacation time. accumulate 3wks year start, like 6. cap starts 240hrs goes there.

Most us always damn near max hours, course, burning half days stay hard cap aren’t losing any. It’s even won’t approve it, teams really small logistics combined wanting schedule busy time absolutely fucking coworker kicks in.

They implemented vacation sell program sell many days vacation you’ve actually taken (so take 5 day vacation, sell additional 5). joke way we’d bankrupt them, every single employee would asking 4-5 figure vacation payouts. know would. 

Most us treat hours unemployment insurance tbh, since state says pay you’re terminated (in many states paying earned vacation time wage theft. Remember that.)  Ugh sucks. gym cameras set + sign up/appointment owner hesitate drop member puts others risk. sound like would much work large gyms put procedure place enforce policies they're really interested anything except monthly withdrawal...  sure. don’t expect full throated answer tomorrow. 

When conversation comes “normal” it’s often interpreted “when get hammered bar?! Wooo!”  think it’s important recognize real world concerns much simpler. Newsom considering proposing shit statewide? SOL can’t get 2nd dose vaccine?

I received first dose 1/29 2nd dose yesterday (2/24). appointment got canceled program employees (Healthcare workers) ended Tuesday (2/23).

I received Pfizer shot 1st dose apparently pharmacies around Moderna. contacted state county health departments said I’m “the list” schedule 2nd dose. Today’s day 28 I’ve told need today, else won’t effective. too...which I'll flat refuse J&amp;J vaccine. I'll shop/drive around much needed avoid it. pushing masks even people alone outdoors? cursed jogging maskless outside San Francisco. Infinitesimally small chance getting covid passing jogger. that’s true, it’s not, it’s lockdown masks sanitation precautions railing prevented know, get it, find alternative normalcy accept things go planned year two.

Aren't bundle empathy? completely false. report September 2020. since.
 honestly don’t give shit anyone’s opinion. I’m going live life nobody’s going stop me. wear mask shopping vaccinated yet. Cant imaigne wearing mask outside go walk. 

Even though, country beginning changed rules every week time wore mask going outside. 

Thankfully, rules wearing mask outside harder get infected outside (knocks wood lol) Actual information order prove can't spread (without waiting months results) we'd challenge studies, huge ethical issues. wait months results. Thanks!! lifetime member team body project (Not affiliated MLM beach body) lot pilates videos. What? ""jersey move""? 

How know someone never actually *been* New Jersey (driving 90 min count)? repeat lame tired memes...

Meanwhile, state highest unemployment payments % previous income? state eastern seaboard legalized recreational cannabis? go anywhere outside cities see beautiful state is. 

Let's forget food... top diversity, literally best pizza nation.

Sorry, get kind tired memes shit NJ.  Yeah, lingering symptoms year (assuming covid.. early docs laughed asked tested back then)  wear mask minimize unnecessary public contact ok. people shaming probably don’t care virtue symbolism - that’s projecting. don’t want get sick you.

Also, people shaming masks kind irrelevant whether it’s good idea wear one. always unreasonable people, certain extent ignore them. temperature guns waste plastic. went urgent care center months ago severe ear infection. screened waiting room 97 oral thermometer read 100. talking about? ticking last three days Fantastic. 🤦‍♀️ Best luck you. followed every precaution best could job still ended getting it. quarantined got thankfully still find gasping air time time breath dumbest things. Indeed...you'd think best thing ever people talk up. Use go gym daily, happy place. Went since Covid hit reopened realized terrible was. one wore mask getting inside, people even wiped machine common courtesy weren’t pandemic. going gym right respect you. Buy set adjustable dumbbells stop literally killing ppl. things home. Gyms luxury necessity. Humans existed without gyms millenia Way helpful Apparently Quebec (Canada) 🙄
We curfew stop partying, starts 8:30; people simply starting parties earlier sleeping over. 

This alone work! Schools, gyms, close-contact hubs must closed time restrictive measures, going go circles.  age get feeling you’re invincible, get smarter protecting health. way would go gym. lungs important muscle tone. get muscle tone back, lungs another matter. Wearing glasses forces make better nose seal makes picky choosing mask.  bonus protection could fact opposed merely protecting eyes vector. Got second dose trial yesterday. talking doctor administered shot said they’re incredibly confident it’ll get approved FDA. m3DiA! don’t find mask dehumanizing way context pandemic. There's probably one state look hard enough. Hang buddy. refer ""Science Speak"". daughter comes home test questions school, ""Can mules babies?"" turn science brain moment practically speaking, male mules usually castrated, 'molly' females rare. struggle true false, yes, mules babies. 

""Dr. Fauci, need wear mask 2025?"" feel brain struggle question way here. 'we'? mean fucking hospitals idiot? influenza season? organ recipient home? sort true/false question scientist struggle with.

A better question would ""What odds better weather vaccinations, community spread ended NC May?"" 

This helps science brains need realize odds meteor could fall kill us new terrible variant could appear that's super effective. answer question 85-90%. That's number would cause people sigh relief, right question asked.   Everyone needs stop worrying move lives already

Absolutely not. objectively awful opinion. close herd immunity. time new strain introduced (like UK varient example), everyone risk problem lot places need reopen.

and could wrong can't imagine lot people wanting spend money experience involves ton security theatre restrictions.  


Latin dancing (kind of) started live, i'm fully vaccinated would love go things normal, worth spending time money watered-down experience masks requirements (i.e. partner dancing, everyone limited practicing footwork alone circle floor) make completely unenjoyable. doesn't, general public suddenly seem think expert knowledge vaccines.  exactly could end pandemic get vaccinated? set people protected ever going covid. 

No, they're not, protected individual level. protection even steps towards herd immunity really there. It’s Czechs. problem everywhere. Russian troll factories (and China too) pushed narrative fake, “just flu”, etc., us media among others helped propel false narrative. saw starting within first month (Jan - feb 2020) Maybe ""jobs"", people jobs 2019 people 2021. Half million+ Americans beg differ. 95% number original strain only.  Yes, likely California/NY ""variants"" panicking people already well. mutation causes concern.  


We really stop referring regionally name key mutations make variants concerning. say ""A strain exhibiting Bob mutation emerged California New York. Scientists believe exhibits identical characteristics Bob strain located South Africa."" 

&amp;#x200B;

Boom! context. know basics is, concern, might concern. new evidence show specific ""regional mutation"" also characteristics, deal then. I'm thinking get old stock baby powder.... little asbestos help keep healthy. pay thousand dollars year gym membership? 

I pay £144, fuck? Nope, needed close beginning data and/or know treat it. also know vaccines possible.

Now nursing homes vaccinated, agree businesses still closed people able decide whether going bar/gym/movie theater/restaurant/shopping center worth it. give someone else hard-earned money. Feds say lockdowns, Provinces that. Same, except bubble quickly blew since kids kids, we've mostly mixing freely among parents. planned decision, decided together kids' well-being important thing we'd take risk.

We friends hang masked, socially-distant, respect well. made choices we've managed respect other's choices without judgement. little sharp, agree. far dystopian real life video ever seen.

This shit needs stop needs stop soon. think meant say elite fitness cult. Staying shape something humans normally, like breathing eating. plenty ways stay shape besides going gym. Sleeping nice. People seem travelling around lot again, see [mobility knowledge whether change government policy people's initiative. *tinfoil hat on*

US Big Pharma want sales vaccine, AZ threatens significantly cheaper (and cost) vaccine. fantastic news! elderly stop confined rooms start interacting.  20% country thought nothing completely unnecessary. idiots, 20% people side decided believe masks could end pandemic. remember articles/tweets said “if everyone wore mask month, pandemic end!! WEAR 👏 👏 MASK 👏!!!”

Jane Lynch tweeted day hopes masks never go away didn’t get cold year. people equally insane. 

Fortunately, 60% country wears masks want end, recognize pain ass. even he’s referring normal flattening downward slope versus anything would consider change direction. Part inferred current progress people local governments handled pandemic far, part gut feel. Local policy almost certainly going err side caution, perhaps exception schools, believe try push reopen fast possible. catch COVID anywhere, gyms exception correct precautions riskier anywhere else, contact tracing time proves true.

Did read CDC guidance? point riskier true. Florida extremely high risk state COVID near top list states. aren’t well.  fcking shit. idea still open Also vaccine lag damn accurate. saw post CoronavirusUS sub someone asking protocol see family everyone vaccinated. couldn’t believe someone actually waiting government answer that. Like, go see damn family. people need direct advice. 

All messaging seems tripling counter measures virus understand also needs kind post Covid campaign especially J&amp;J vax around corner. Yeah, goal get gains reduce body fat bit. Hoping achieve august workout almost daily good food without supplements.  outdoors one nearby going wtf Purely anecdotal here. second felt fine minor headache, minor aches lasted hours. chronic pain it’s hard tell vaccine normal me. brother felt fine pain injection arm day after. mom patients reactions. It’s younger people feel immune response. old, I’m early 30s. mentioned, sympathize. people mental physical health, livelihood.

I definitely relate saying hit gym five days week, substituting home exercise tough. I'm constantly trying find ways get 15,000 steps elevate heart rate least 30 minutes day, without equipment challenging. That's isometric pliometric exercises thrown in. Getting NYC covered snow seems like every day rough.

None changes fact gyms safe. matter personal risk either, like drunk driving. decide care get disease, I'm inevitably going spread someone else make decision themselves, know could much worse them. Remember dreaded Super Bowl bump never happened? think masks social distancing simple preventative measures implement compared ventilation. many buildings, particularly schools, simple and/or practical provide right kind ventilation safely reopen. Like we're talking millions dollars years work redesign rebuild pandemic temporary situation. mean, talking simple terms like open windows doors increase airflow, completely agree emphasizing lot more. second this. It’s literally big deal wear one 10 min hour got you’ve wearing shift 10-13 hours since March start get really old! care kill people protecting myself.

And is... know angry, commend least honest admitting rather attempting rationalize. Goalposts moved much, know vaccines protect hospilization. people it. don’t contact trace enough make assertions whether gyms sources spread. 

It laughable maintain otherwise. gave up. correct. we're seeing data date report information, date onset. means data sensitive reporting delays. week likely ""bad"" week, followed return declining case counts.  Thanks stars tiny gym complex. 2 person max. SO. end. Safe n sound. going back gym get vaccine. run outside exercise home. Actually saving lot $ too.  chooses go eat restaurant right accepting certain amount risk know what? That’s fine someone choose go gym go eat restaurant that’s outside acceptable level risk taking. 

It's nearly year people still fucking understand person choosing flaunt safety guidelines putting risk. 

Man, leave fucking virus completely expose selfishness total inability consider others rampant country. Calisthenics free. Exactly.  feel like maybe much focus early regarding types businesses open/closed enough reminding people careful home.  

That's happened me. careful went public, let guard got infected daughter stopped work. Thankfully, case serious. Yeah go fairly late night there’s usually 1-2 people, sometimes none. gym two stories well though it’s fairly spread out. got 2nd Moderna shot literally 5 minutes ago. (I’m still sitting hospital waiting 10 minutes). I’m done masks except legally required private company requires it. Seriously, point vaccinating we’re direct path normal. That’s would option honest. Okay, mix things up, need take deep breath, take step back, think what's going on. 

You report 10/2020 - supported CDC report 9/2020 - saying sudden data completely wrong, highlighting cases shit south? 

I'm saying report wrong, saying complete 180 late game data said exact opposite 4 months ago little sus. Bad bot think mostly people mask compliant see little cost. equate hand washing like practically impact comfortably living one's life. Although I've favor mask requirements many public settings hard see come reasons ""opposed mask-wearing"" without resorting armchair psychoanalyzing. Guessing said don’t need vaccine won’t get it? We're talking theory variants here, least 4 real, identified ""Variants Concern"" spreading right now, already exhibit increased contagiousness, somewhat increased severe illness, reduced vaccine effectiveness.

/u/Max_Downforce absolutely correct say variants complicating things. going able return normal critical mass population received vaccine gotten sick covid. know sick dealing it, need stay focused months vaccines roll out. Donald? like/dislike ratio video glorious. I'm gonna need chill mess read [what CDC Yup, mental thing. Glad got home route planned, go get gainz! Jesus. can't imagine living kind guilt. working school, lots windows open.  numbers probably pretty far off, might better saying. snowstorms country really affected people getting tested probably reports getting gathered sent time. vaccinations. really takes week numbers even out. Yeah, way going gym fully vaccinated. Really, people following rules, exactly problem almost every go. 

People really give shit that's thing fucked lives killed 500,000 people US. 

This article people getting POSITIVE test going exercise class. fucking arrogance idiocy amazing. people leave weights trash lying around

Imagine that, people give fuck others, give fuck others.

If **you** piece shit. got 2nd Pfizer dose feel comfortable going week 2. still been, non busy hours there's least 15 feet person. Masks hit miss gym goers, always keep mine whole time. gyms safe, much. depends crowds mask cleaning compliance.  Whatever works person, guess. case, gym twenty mins foot door, still count time pack up, get dressed, walk there, get dressed there, get dressed workout, come home, shower time etc. think time used warm threadmill home. mean country hijabs required else get stoned acid thrown family makes comparison time. risk I'm taking putting people

Oh well that's relief... I'll make sure tell dead aunt understand risk putting people. think sanitizer fixation partly due achievable safety measure people wanting accept simply taking transmit virus. Rubbing alcohol easy, producing mass spec n95s fixed price still impossible. 

The winning passed strategy cheap rapid testing accepts higher error rate. 

Ventilation difficult solution many classrooms workplaces. inexpensive compared able use spaces though. Wearing mask hygiene issue, surprise they’re unsanitary slobs. Yea, day bump really takes like 2 weeks get data back reality due backlogs (or people getting tested/vaccinated normally would have). texas, tons snow country pushed everything back. thanks, I'll pass. Yeah, vague stereotypes usually going give accurate impression country. aka ""The Pig."" answer question 85-90%.

Uhhhh...citation needed. community spread frankly probably never going happen, let alone majority Americans fully vaccinated. seems reasonable me. gym similar go peak hours. 15 plus feet people masks, there's little risk think. sounds like misunderstood bad teacher community college. I've American 7 years sore loser. lmao *could* reasonable close schools absolute last resort, things get really bad local basis, temporarily slow spread - like closures weeks couple months cities instituted fall 1918. Hitting panic button closing schools state even nationwide, indefinitely arbitrary unquantifiable “when it’s safe” condition met, disaster. 

Closing schools 12-15 days (remember “two weeks”?) calm things it’s needed one thing. Closing 12-15 *months* well beyond point cure worse disease. Forget pizzas applause. Pay time anyone wants. wear one 40-60 hours week? do. It’s pain ass. I’ve wearing day, every day, almost year end sight. started getting sinus migraines. everyone wearing couple hours store. get shamed going walk working outside alone quiet suburb without mask on. Jeez man it’s joke easy! Jersey great place live great people it...but admit clusterfuck small town politics finest extent state could replicate really basis meme, typical hurt durr live swamp full refineries people driven turnpike passed bayway could comprehend. 

And love tiny little towns mayor/council/police department/Dpw. scientists saying social distancing masks still necessary? think need scientists weighing point.  


I think maybe things like Trumpian antics early swung us hard opposite direction. Yes, decisions weighed data science - absolutely. doubt. weighed. decided entirely.  


Scientists set public policy directly certainly handle messaging - we're seeing why. Americans saved $1 trillion (k shaped recovery) pandemic. pent demand going absolutely bonkers. That’s false harmful families lost children.  Same. I've going less peak hours, sticking cardio since people nearby (like 5 6 whole large open cardio room least 15 20 feet everyone. weights area always busy. figure get back weight training everyone vaccinated work cardio bodyweight meantime. take pole classes studio awesome safety. sharing equipment, alcohol sanitizing, masks required. first worried wearing mask working (this also summer studio barely air conditioning, gets super hot there) problem think meant global cumulative total Covid-19 deaths 2020-21 2.5 million.  That's poster mistrusting demanding schools open. entire political party platform dismantle public education suddenly wants turn around wants full open pandemic, comes extremely dishonest. decades conservatives US railed public schools ineffective, suddenly saying essential, enough point teachers go back without vaccinating. Yeah that's meant thanks clarifying. virus take many paths reinvading person’s body. shouldn’t scare us. planet make sense?

It makes sense planet vaccinated people regularly interacting people vaccinated. long majority population unvaccinated, people *are* vaccinated still need conscious spreading virus. 

I know you’re eager put behind you, that’s reason public health officials lie telling go whatever want without care world. Well pandemic always going end last people line get vaccine. It’s crazy well understood concept 100 years ago 1918 flu pandemic yet still struggling incorporate response despite generations advancements science public health. reasons care infection counts. one thing, death counts lagging indicator better act preemptively based case trends. Secondly, point really trying keep overall case counts larger volumes cases help create variants, could lead creation variant bypasses protection unlucky. Also, variant strains (especially UK strain moment) contagious, meaning things get hand quicker, widespread, also appearing result serious illness standard covid strain.

I know want see good news point, variants need taken seriously everything slow things get world vaccinated going help lot.

But reality I’ve dozens vaccinations years never even bothered check see new serious side effects. feel like treated one differently would giving irrational fear. Ask they're also favor government mandated hand-washing well. Yeah, I'm really sure people saying ""for people case sniffles."" would say half friends (mainly 30s) caught still suffer issues (4 months later), healthy ones actually notice more. athletic ones notice they're much breath now. suppose people never really exercised before, notice difference, experience, healthier ones definitely tell.

However, effectiveness appeared lower people 60 years older also comorbidities, like diabetes heart disease, agency said, adding efficacy rate 42.3% month getting shot."" It’s good idea considering organized experienced logistics are. big reason go one availability. one thing vaccines suppress illness, likely also prevent spreading covid. (This shown mRNA vaccines, real reason belive J&amp;J different there) means J&amp;J, population quicker reach herd immunity.

In short, population scale, getting vaccines arms likely better vaccines likely prevent indivual illness. entire world

Is US, UK, South Africa, Australia entire world? East Asia heavily utilized ""harm reduction"" overall policy, look South Korea, HK, Taiwan, post-Wuhan China, Vietnam, Thailand, Bhutan, Singapore. Remember everyone thought COVID going devastate entire continent Africa India?

Sweden typical European standards, comparing Norway Denmark makes look remarkably bad.

On face it, there's obvious logic comparing Sweden neighbours, there's also good case calling cherry-picking. mention, people complaining achievement gap *silent* came achievement gaps SLIFE students, ELL students, special needs.

I heard year achievement gap ever before, achievement gap plague schools, decades. ELL students regularly misdiagnosed Special Needs, lack ability accommodate needs.

We nothing group, get arms. People ardent supporters achievement, likely mumbling word say schools reopen. ELL students? Fuck em. got wanted. see many arguments favor age-based system, posters discussed here. think significant argument it: Inequality. 

Connecticut insane income inequality, translates health inequality. prioritizing age, inherently benefits wealthier people live longer, leaving low income communities color exposed longer. communities already impacted covid work essential roles less flexibility work home easily quarantine. think 70 year old former hedge fund guy get vaccine 25 year old grocery worker trying prevent deaths? Yes. odds grocery store workers grandmother lives less likely get vaccine (internet access, public outreach, vaccine hesitancy) hedge fund guy. de facto keeping vaccines low income communities already higher rates spread higher rates death, perpetuating deaths communities. It’s unintended consequence states go age route, make significant efforts vaccinate eligible/vulnerable low income communities. Rooting nice neighbors north. Question smarter - folks already jabbed time clears hurdles, would variant version booster shot later date? Also, folks shot yet, would getting newer version early vaccines wont require booster? covid damages blood vessels, happen get damage blood vessels supply GI system organs, organs going hard time. example people whose mesenteric artery damaged covid entire sections intestines cut intestine tissue literally died developed gangrene insufficient blood supply, begun become unable eliminate feces starting come vomit.  here.

No one cares, work bars restaurants half clients ""here's take out...oh happens table there! Want beer?"" thing. virus ebola magnitude (90% fatality) would never cause pandemic anywhere close size solely due much smaller window infected person spread it. covid u contagious week spreading even know you’re carrying it, ebola you’re dead within 2 days two days you’re horrrificly i’ll organs melting aren’t coming contact anyone besides healthcare professionals heavy ppe Right, unlike us actually vaccine (as far know make Pfizer). We're far behind everyone don't. Fantastic news Pfizer's vaccine made USA? True coworkers. issue first shot. low fever mildly unwell feeling two days second dose. Nothing major though. Coworkers somewhat similar response. few. Yeah headline biennial, people know word ambiguity biannual generate clicks. True, expected. 5 January, national health authorities said models predicted would reach cross 50% mid-February. that's exactly happened. also among highest test sequencing rates world, pretty clear throughout earlier models accurate. well-covered local media, too. So, nation least, nobody say surprised. anyone else think (other ease deployment) J&amp;J vax looks kinda shitty Fair enough, I'd wager odds greater long term COVID effects rank quite low things could harm them. Spanish Flu 1918-1920 think cases literally went 0 month, would still experts shouting need remain vigilant next surge right around corner. Osterholm included.  many doses administer today? definitely wouldn’t embellish claim essential apply. I’ll talk coworkers management see what’s what. Thank input. Yep, doesn’t let people say Florida bad easily.

Honestly, Florida’s performance perplexing points factors must considered. Maybe face masks social distancing legitimately aren’t effective said thought. Honestly, seems mostly based honor system. would lie cut line fit essential category, fret making appointment.  terms cases? Yes, probably worse.

In terms deaths? No. Poor countries non-existent health infrastructures tend young populations less vulnerable covid. ok many industries it? Assuming bought food past year? think gets shopping bag? People. People working environments risking covid. Teachers special. Somebody watched Legend rewatched first part Emma Thompson bunch!! forgot flattening curve lockdowns started, whole point keep hospitals open people need them.

The thing flattening curve that, end lockdown, use mitigation methods keep curve flattened. Places like US UK lot EU took almost steps ensure COVID would managed *and* lockdowns would avoided. Instead, falsely presented either/or choice Nah pretty much it. Teachers unions allow million years teachers get vaccinated warehouse workers supermarket workers work buildings full hundreds people social distancing un-realiastic actually go work (opposed WFH zoom) throughout pandemic.

There workers many industries told year work warehouse hundreds staff god forbid see mum. 

Warwick university also recently done study shows schools contribute significance community spreading. deaths plateau follow month deaths likely prevented nearly 100 percent  long trial? magic predicting spikes always reason one coming. Osterholm ever quit. March St. Patrick's day, April Easter, May Memorial day Mother's Day that's first few.

He keep doom predictions long people gone back normal. 64% higher 64% people get infected actually deadly?  Might overrated YOU, others.

That's problem whole thing going forward. People want Lockdowns continue well 2022 forcing views others danger mitigated.

There reason restrictions continue vaccination occurs semi-large scale. one saying not. sign rather extensive form symptoms pass temp check. think lying sheet anyone's best interest, therefore need stay home I'm symptoms. sucks costs many people childcare day. chance one less side effects, that's everyone's best interest situation.

Tide's turning turning quickly. I'd imagine number voluntary houseless teens quite low. lot due economic prejudice good old regular prejudice. Actual headline: Paltrow: NHS boss urges caution star's long Covid regime Jab colloquial British English. I’m sure similar words don’t get (Reuters) - Hungary entering toughest period since start coronavirus pandemic next two weeks hospitals come strain like never before, Prime Minister Viktor Orban said Thursday.

What entire year? worst time? 

I’m legitimately confused. Maybe it’s B117 variant don’t know. Username checks Times different back then. guidance said needed travelled recently, super hot fever, disgusting cough. Brother barely fever laid day. never fever chills, cough relentless worst I’ve ever had, definitely didn’t travel recently. mean people get vaccine course “done shit”. Life finite. many years see grandkids, go collage, explore world, etc. Covid here, ALWAYS variants ALWAYS variants flu. Thats nature RNA viruses.

Real life data Israel hospitalization ratio 15 per 100,000 covid vaccination (keeping mind mostly folks aged 65 plus). flu hospitalization 150 per 100,000. lockdown every winter? travel, go concerts, see family close schools months? course fucking not.  delusional think continue hiding home virus IFR far LOWER seasonal flu vaccination worries! confused appreciate following up. Sorry everyone grouch lol good things possible coming soon, means return norm. Aka, resuming greedy destruction planet. biggest danger giving COVID everyone around public wanted share grandad got pfizer jab today! cant explain happy am. granny gets I'm gonna feelso free (still gonna follow health advice ofc) $0. money that. Florida done worst could done, make us best either. People either giving us much praise acting like we're New York 2.0 (and people seemed wanted us end way, pretty disturbing). lost bunch weight instead stopping pints bar started drinking couple whiskies home... far less calories guess?  Perfect example rabbit hole public health led us became source control narrative rather personal protective approach. hear yourself? People basic risk reward calculation determine sometimes extreme circumstances call extreme measures. 

Correct. So, feel risk, stay home. everybody else bend idea safety. responsibility assess risk.  you’re opposed taking vaccine find job lets work home. 

Or, conversely, stay home I’m talking mandating consumers vaccinated I’m talking workers. 

This makes sense. retail setting, 'consumers' would outnumber 'workers' exponentially. necessary two people get vaccine feel safe, nobody else needs to? None entire argument logic whatsoever. blind hysteria. scared, stay home. know sick dealing it, need stay focused months vaccines roll out.

This important point. 

Thanks. Pfizer director says world may need product. Lol mentioned worked meat processing plant. remember outbreaks US meatpacking plants point meat shortage US. can't imagine pressure must keep working potentially ""hide symptoms"" developed any. see common ground keeping plant running keeping everyone healthy.

Hang there. shall pass. no, hate people like you. excess deaths show Covid common months? closer ""normal"" number covid calls vs non covid calls? issue conspiracies go infinitely deep.

Why fewer flu cases? medical facilities given cash based number covid cases, report flu cases covid cases. Pfizer others better Astra shows 10% effectiveness SA variant mRNA still showing 60%. Australia’s good position covid wise. borders aren’t opening time soon. low covid numbers incredibly rich country low population.

Why use Astra Pfizer afford cost difference wait supplies?

If Astra vaccine sure, it’s still good vaccine. better vaccines use inferior one?  94% effective exactly article behind paywall? Getting virus, significant effects, death? definitely still prevented Novavax Janssen IIRC (can't remember exact %s CIs)

For AZ there's significant data. Oh sorry right now, whenever Upstate reopened schools September lots outbreaks. reopened churches dining too. pretty mild summer here. Cases doubled. went Christmas break, bam hit new highs. they're even variants here, even though we're one lowest amount vaccines highest amount new cases country. One big issue (at least Austria) keeping proper record.
Austria newlyish introduced national system electronic health records. 

Now nobody knows whether health professionals register vaccinations (it seems bureaucratic nightmare) vaccines lying around (which states saying don't). Oh plenty cases March April, testing. Sweet! Lol getting called serial killer hanging family absolutely straw man. There’s plenty personal anecdotes go around people getting vaccinated still hiding away homes. There’s tons viral social media posts “no can’t go restaurants getting vaccinated”. parents line vaccinated said recently itd cool nuclear family protected virus talked South Africa strain. Tons headlines news articles well. People already posting they’re gonna wear masks forever even we’re back normal. You’re either living rock uniquely reasonable social media circle. 

And yeah, way expect things work toward normalcy people get vaccinated. Today state announced ease restaurant restrictions cases fall people vaccinated way found news story people posting saying governor murderer so. 

The goalposts constantly shifting—I remember locked stop spread keep hospitals overtaxed. low rates minimum. make sure zero new cases. it’s country wide herd immunity. yeah, don’t much patience anyone trying pump breaks assuage anxieties Think every cell body tiny computer, mRNA tiny line code. use mRNA send instructions cells body execute command. There’s lot different things could possible sort technology. Example: maybe use mRNA tell diabetic person’s cells start producing insulin. would take legal action fight whatever happening. right live comfortably apartment.

Your living situation sounds like absolute nightmare. would never able tolerate that. would immediately hire lawyer, sounds like option. would move family member. Living place paying rent can't walk around freely home absolute hell. CDC encourage better science 🤣🤣🤣 “no additional test results exist support initial test result true positive” first outbreak, said. 

Yeah, false positive seems like real possibility here. asthma auto immune disorder

Getting vaccine tomorrow. Literally sobbing right lol.  CDC already said this, widely reported. estimate 25% population already ~mid December.

Since then, we've added 67% mid December death toll, probably close another 20%. pretty clear point somewhere 40-50% population question ""had"". personal opinion people natural immunity cells develop symptoms. people really infected? infectious they? long ""have"" it?  Yes.

You've really gotta feel AZ this.

They invent species-saving vaccine giving away zero profit suddenly *they're* bad guys.

Really unfair. long everybody goes gym lives alone, works home everything delivered them, gyms open cause spread virus. mean you’re preaching choir here. agree 100 percent I’m telling anti vaccine sentiment largely based safety concerns nothing else. said media government shit messaging wise that’s primary driver anti vax sentiment imo like EU bit short 600 million vaccines supplied end June, deliveries confirmed. laziness. 16 year olds lower income families even aware need studying, let alone parents afford fancy prep classes. say someone achieved 95% score graduate school admissions test. Oh No!

Anyway vaccinated mean can't CATCH SPREAD Coronavirus. still can. (it severe YOU.. immune system primed better fight it). could still spread end killing others.

We actually know sure, 100% yet. also study released earlier week oh yeah, maybe actually stop spread. Considering works way vaccines viruses, unheard possible vaccine virus either. can’t emphasize enough stop reading CNN. irresponsible journalism finest. also see headlines constantly. absolute clickbait garbage. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

Why care health want look health? Serious question. one thing want bring point personal risk assessment. agree general, bit complicated comes communicable disease. Like, accept willing risk gym, that's fine. adult make choices likely, get sick fine. problem is, get sick infect someone able handle well (in different setting like store)? person didnt risk threshold, still got sick. make sense? dad getting vaccine Saturday!!! That’ll make him, mom, sister, BIL, husband, vaccine. That’s immediate family (minus son, niece, nephew). Wheeeeewwwww relief!!!!! think EU find way force countries administer AZ shots sitting first, giving vaccines. Germany alone sitting nearly 1.2 million doses, administering. criminal. family working class immigrants. went public school worked butt get am. Get privileged white saviour mentality bullshit outta back? EU: skeptical AZ supply promises

Also EU: [we don’t want ever getting this? Serious question. Seems like forever chasing variants, needing new vaccines such. everyone always level immunity, vaccines never 100% effective, ever really get close people again, attending events, going bars, weddings, etc? Unless virus mutates typical headcold, know safe/ok resume normal? make ""call""? Yup thats state. Pisses ignorant people want timeline- want metrics need meet.

Is x percentage vaccinated? x percentage hospitalizations? Literally 0 hospitalizations due Covid? R0 .5? Less 1000 cases per day? Less 100 per day? Literally cases per day 1 month? 

I want know metrics gotta get order THINK getting out. There's goal that's *feels* perpetual. yeah joke last march.i 103 degree fever 5 days, cough, could barely move, traveled internationally JFK couple days prior couldn’t get test hadn’t traveled china lol actual virus/ sickness showing signs improvement, many people they’re able pick shards lives. Business worked decades, done. Lost homes. Lost friends. Lost savings. 

A lot people lost lot, many others able continue getting paid. It’s stressful isolation, lives completely destroyed, starting still really hard time. 

Shit still really bad, lot people. lot people feel completely abandoned. That’s going away overnight. Many people still waiting get vaccines. 

We’re done yet. 

It’s insane pretend are. 

It’s going take time heal. I'm saying they're same, I'm saying everything I've read far indicates mutations concern same. I'd love get information understanding nothing besides news articles posted actual data still public. California NY strains exhibiting similar mutation South Africa?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm saying that's GOOD, I'm saying we're observing nothing new, way they've mutated known quantity thus far - vaccines still effective. 

&amp;#x200B;

Yes, absolutely concern different strains different properties could merge and/or mutate further. Yep. doubt. agree- UK variant successfully merging California/Brazil/SA variant would nasty especially somehow managed merge worst both.  


The point though far concern strains ends similar existing ones people panicking. garbage article early week California strain saying ""the devil already here"" worst it.  


Yes, get strain spreading UK + SA properties, that's problem. far, - strains watch mutations known quantities far. actual data available, I'll interested read it. sure, look 3m respirators Amazon pretty cheap right now. Like said, filter exhaled breath comfortable. like no1 really mentions cardio focused class people right next breathing onto other. Thats people gym. 

In normal circumstances gym lifting weights making sure close anyone, crazy covid risk. Dang that's impressive must millionaire something sure bud? sure live places indoor dining things open. anyone information getting vaccines state? medical condition, current qualify vaccine home state, pandemic, I’m wasn’t planning heading back time soon. made vaccine appointment March, seems silly fly drive thousands miles twice get jabbed. I’d feel lot better knowing could get vaccinated sometime relatively soon without travel long distance.

Any advice?  Awesome, wear mask. Eventually to. right now, keep diapering face holes. I'll get booster. stay locked house forever though  welcome add point, gyms big spreaders **so far**. Relatives mine run franchised fitness studio seen comprehensive local national data support that. However, assumption current mitigation measures place - capacity limits, ventilation, masks. would shock slightest gyms (specifically small sq. ft. studios HIIT classes, like mentioned CDC report) contribute higher % cases restrictions lifted indoor workouts. Time tell, rollback common sense mitigation techniques ""masks indoors times"" foolish step opinion, knowing know virus spreads. UK bet one horse

Huh? UK bet *all* horses bar Moderna. want wait year data

People got first doses vaccine back July half year. waiting for? variant, B.1.156, contains E484K mutation that's found South African Brazilian variants. situation incredibly uncommon/rare. would never put situation. Never would signed lease. would found way make work move out. put bullshit. OCD germaphobe, I'd love ditch handshakes forever. I'd much rather air kiss cheeks/half hug greeting really need touch everyone meet/greet. 

Mask cold, not? 

I realize I'm minority both! choose self isolate safety long want

All essential workers anyone else forced work outside home haven’t luxury whole time. California first closed cases healthcare system overwhelmed April 2020, daily new case average 1,500. Even deadly spike November-January ended, daily new case average week 6,218. That’s FOUR times higher first went state emergency lock down. honestly believe due statistical fatigue. Yeah numbers drastically better. They’re also several times higher pandemic first began.

Confirmed cases mean sh\*\*\*. Testing back abysmal. likely cases April 10x reported more. Normalize mandated completely different. Yes people wear mask shield want to, others glaring even threatening you, chances won’t next time. 1. poke roughly quickly, especially something sharp pointed.

""she jabbed ribs""

2. quick, sharp blow, especially fist.

""a jab stomach""

yeah thatll convince people get vaccinated well likely get antibodies old fashioned way.. people gym fine. reddit found article HIIT class high risk covid. Like wow shit went gym every day pre covid least day.

""Your prob work out"" &lt;-- Ok, 100% know point full shit 1000% wrong this. everything else said complete utter bullshit. Thanks heads up.

I workouts inside. used run treadmill every day. Post covid found solutions. teeny tiny space work in. Like, literally bumping things time. Super cramped. bought weights. try stay quiet neighbors hear me, use bluetooth headphones listen music. signed online workout programs focused found amazing gyms, classes, livestream events, etc. online. Require little terms equipment. treadmill. 

Trying stay safe equate living hazmat suit. follow guidelines. seen friends family throughout pandemic, outside, distanced, masks. made best situation grateful health ability work home. grateful essential worker. grateful vaccine get one soon. 

And yes think people privileged complain minor inconveniences. Yeah people understand official approvals take looooong goddamn time usually. long, either live hellscape forever make educated presumption based data plus know vaccines general. Individual risks consequences others. 

Is risk potential harm others still considered individual's personal risk? Cool . curious setup wtf douchecanoe Really? Honestly different opening everyone?

You bring good point many individuals significant pre-existing conditions ones unable receive primary care thus might even aware diagnosis. Yet another reason trying roll vaccines based equitable cause problems solutions. Every vaccine cause fever. fever body fighting infection thats vaccine suposed get body do. know people pfizer jab reactions varying sore arm bed day felt like hangover. media saying AZ vacine telling lies. well like cautious. learned lesson way optimistic beginning pandemic. Numbers surely decreasing dont go significantly higher like 70% adult population vaccinated wont Yes, paint 3m half face respirator. wear KN95 underneath filters inhalation exhaled breath. 

I wore somewhere indoors long time, like wanted tattoo piercing, want go see friends thier house, go club. come home change garage get right shower.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Right! common sense? Also, remember little like college thr teacher would like “we’re class outside bit?” we’re excited! Pandemic aside it’s nice kids shouldn’t indoors day anyway disagree. nabbed very, last minute dose. 20 minutes get door across city. got asked nurse vaccinating appointments release 20 minutes notice, due snow/roads/weather Chicago got ton snow. Like you, assumed winter storm slowing things people unable make appointments.

She said no, weather really affected vaccination speed (at least Rush), rather estimating # vaccination appointments based upon many able past. gotten much faster vaccinating folks, point needed open people due undercalculated estimations.

So say 100%, least northern Illinois. amount snow got really issue us. guess maybe we're used getting even foot snow rolls through? wouldn’t go far, think things much, much closer normal June. Even reading write-up, confused whether intending say various strains different same.

For recors: they're different mutations different impacts disease, one big dangers end ""meeting"" wild &amp; creating hybrid multiple bad mutations. 

For instance: researcher US reported finding least one instance hybrid CA UK strains. CA variant appears potentially deadly &amp; antibody resistant, whereas UK strain appears increase severity (particularly among children) dramatically increase transmissibility.

Whether hybrid actually retains impacts unknown, since mutations occur different places genome question. sent anything USPS lately? wouldn’t get vaccines 2025 shipping Fake news. following mandates. Masks equipment, mask exertion exercise. That’s hear things like “we still higher spring 2020 numbers” roll eyes, testing crap back curve early mid 2020 going much bed reality curve today. I’m sick “bubbles” “pods.” miss seeing want want without worry they’re they’re contact with. It’s exhausting.  Sounds like good reason get flu shot go feel sick unless absolutely necessary absolutely necessary wear mask. avoidable. 

If real 2-4 week shutdown ramping vaccinations, would probably enough stop combined masking, reasonable social distancing, extensive testing including POC tests afterwards. 

It’s like thing spreads uncontrollably nations adopted sane policies like Australia, NZ Vietnam. 

And it’s like half-hearted shutdowns quick reopenings prevented economic loss. Even Sweden’s economy suffered thing global hit economy people don’t really want shop travel pandemic even can. 

I fear getting low enough variant % picking stupid change course. paid people stay home 4 weeks. 

This thing us unless something really bad happens (ie variant completely evades immunity). 

It mostly gone US Fall, question many people want die then. Right Can't lift home? lie people then? Tell still hazard others vaccinated, even that’s true, increase compliance unvaccinated?

What trust science? Especially fiasco telling people wear masks early days (another “virtuous” lie)?  Lol guy says knows operate yet somehow cases dramatically falling, 3 vaccines counting, vaccine administration ramping fuck up, somehow 'we're much worse last year' like let's throw context nuance window. can't see friends? perfectly safe outside, distanced, wearing masks. Covid unlikely spread setting. order people actually stay home sick, need legislate either mandatory paid sick days much higher minimum wage fewer people one day’s pay away financial ruin. happens, people still going go work sick send sick kids school can’t afford otherwise.

So, even place employment, personal opinions masks vary. personally, I've adopted stance of, matter beliefs are, mask rule follow stay open. like working, job, making money, like exercising gym, I'll wear mask want able things. Heck, even run incline 12 7MPH workout keep mask whole time. Yes, sucks, required.

This sentiment shared managers. seems pretty evenly split. managers believe mask wear work. Others, like myself, do, regularly make rounds around club make sure members wearing masks. Unfortunately, members think whatever want managers wear mask. managers believe wearing mask reprimanded managers, ALSO regional managers entire area. Somehow, nothing happened. And, managers mountains evidence photos videos wearing mask testimony them. Somehow, nothing happened them... suggests least one connection regional higher ups agrees stance show openly.

Overall, appreciate discussion here, feels sub particular people can't appreciate nuance without saying need completely shut every single case COVID eliminated (slight exaggeration course) completely ignore safety measure things trending upwards vaccines here. I'm agreement reason rush re-opening, especially since finally good reason optimism. 

The main point I'm trying get across regardless official guidance mandates various political public entities, person different risk tolerance feel safe enough enter ""normal"" activities. That's true throughout pandemic, going become even important keep mind questions reopening become pointed. Covid soon. know types viruses eventually die out. Academic content, maybe 70% kids, you’re optimistic. Socialization, physical activity, extracurriculars, activity goes real school = 0% remote.

And next articles “not enough Americans want vaccine”. Well shit, what’s point? Good article, CDC guidelines need tweaked soon. 66 million people received least one 2 doses, another 25 million gotten virus. love good news look daily motivator, I’m losing hope. 

Fauci saying need accept things won’t able vaccinating, like going seeing people. hope things change soon. I'll know teacher California get paid nice wage+benefits (Equivalent \~100k salary).

Our facilities still terrible updated since put place. Also got built backwards funny.

Edit: also plenty supplies! sad. Hopefully access vaccine now. best could find (36 seconds in) version keep seeing mopping shown much longer employee mopping says something much cleaning they're doing. jab every year might standard seasonal flu jabs However, think LEED give points better fresh air ventilation.

As far retrofitting, two years ago school district spent $50 million PER SCHOOL upgrading hvac windows. would expect upgrading schools US cost tens trillions $$$. feel like goes show infectious covid truly compared flu. I'm also bit worried used normalize mask usage foreseeable future. believe asian countries right, already sick courtious thing wear mask get sick, ugh im tired constantly wearing mask everytime leave car. I’m concerned safety, fun? can’t mingle / socialize what’s point? won’t tell someone preferred life “good” not, surely realize exception, right? people often visit family, see friends, engage group activities, etc. low enough neglible harping gaslighting. gym garage door thing use loading equipment open times better ventilation mean dank temporary portable building that's since 90s one tiny window one large window good ventilation? 

huh. TIL heard new variant New York could evade body's immune system easily, regardless vaccinated backed monoclonal antibody treatments. pray Holy Lord third dose protects variant like would many variants spread across world right now. odds weather never definitive enough avoid saying ""may"" ""could"". like 95% sure something sound definite.

Kid: ""I'm scared"" 
Me: ""It's fine; planes crash"" 
Kid: ""Then safety stuff?"" 
Me: ""It's holdover earlier days flying. Really apply anymore"".  None support idea covid either traveling corridor one room another infecting someone traveling ventilation system infecting someone.  

If want use smoke metaphor, smell little bit smoke mean there's enough air ill health effects you. true virus - even small amount could escape one classroom enter another, odds would enough infect anyone seem extremely small. true, we'd seen evidence transmission now. downvote stupidity move on. gym regularly remind people wear masks properly everyone they're assholes. say “the plane won’t crash?” message “if you’re vaccinated, get together vaccinated friends family.” Full stop. doesn’t need anything that. Like anything else world, incredibly small probabilities risks don’t need mentioned every conversation topic. people leave work, don’t say significant “I’ll probably home, chance I’ll die traffic.” clearly habit health experts adopted manage expectations throughout pandemic, needs stop talking acceptable risks. can’t. aren’t. shouldn’t either. school burned 5 years ago they're still reconstructing I'm portakabins ventilation improvement basically thing one wants a-hole gets someone sick. 

This messaging failure, too. Unless you’re literally coughing someone’s mouth rubbing snot eyes, “getting anyone sick.” virus gets people sick, people. need stop treating getting COVID like kind failure. It’s highly contagious disease. It’s going spread. It’s one’s fault. Um, standard 15 days South Africa read article, admittedly mostly written government perspective.  Parents medically fragile kids cry corner. Bro world going come around might excuse stay inside day anymore.   Controversial opinion: no. really cost-ineffective way make difference nearly impossible many schools. mean, talking minor upgrades existing HVAC system, ok. mean putting portable air purifier, sure, guess. many schools need massive overhauls extremely expensive time consuming, virus (1) high risk kids teachers (2) already vaccine rolled (3) likely significant endemic virus within year.

Just wear masks, open window can, add portable purifiers can't. 100 percent, don’t give us life back months vaccines take back envious primary care docs/offices probably expected navigate clearance process (including patients coming insisting obese, hypertensive diabetic refusing treatment years) DONT GUYS LISTEN SCIENTISTS!

\*eats bacon egg cheese breakfast everyday, refuses get vaccine saw instagram post\* It’s “erring side caution” even necessarily timeline— it’s kind plan, well-defined, reasonable goals metrics hit order get back full normal. don’t expect something like “ok May 1st everything back”. expect plan though. much ask??? people okay plan, metrics, clear goals get back normal?? Actually remember beginning pandemic found masks get little better filtering wear get moist. However comment says, keeps going eventually gets good filtering starts filtering air, too, making breath go around mask... agree. example, vaccinated member family vaccinated, someone that's lived you, actually without mask? sit give hug things like that? answer likely, course, can,"" Fauci feel like lot people making strawmen attack. clearly saying fully vaccinated people safe gather. thing keep asking wait stuff public without masks distancing people vaccinated. get that, I’d rather estimates conservative “it’ll magically disappear” point. It’s depressing are, ya. never get data honest. 1 tens thousands 60 would end hospital infection anyway. You’d vaccinate millions people test regularly get data.  Great article interesting think really depends gym much ventilation airflow is. Thankfully gym set outdoor area. think masks help quite bit people use them, idea going indoor portion gym- like 20 year old gym bro going post public service announcements got covid. wish media would chill wait data. *have first!* Like said, time see, let's chill practice safe then. There's lot cases reinfection know there's something immunity, course mean go party there's data. maybe decide safely see lower-risk family members antibodies. Thank you. great information. Exactly. extend mandates month, want know it’s X metric wasn’t met, X metric _had been_ met, they’d lift it. X metric exists, publish it. Even changes. doesn’t exist, it’s gut feelings worthless. Yeah, dictator, things would different. First, dipshits who've put loud pipes pickups cars would go pay fix shit make quiet again. Second, given single dose 60 high risk preexisting conditions. would reduce mortality twice current rate decline due vaccination. point needs take mask off, closer six feet VP, say “we able fully vaccinated miracle modern medicine...you without fear also fully vaccinated!”

I'm hoping weeks away happening. tough balancing act. one hand people need hope return normalcy. other, can't get lax, delay return normalcy. Link paper itself:

That much dare speak ill J&amp;J vaccine sub, you’ll downvoted called piece shit. 
 
Your point exactly interested shot push get Pfizer, don’t want vaccine says ‘Oh you’ll get *mild* COVID now’, want total protection. don’t care it’s two shots, wouldn’t care five shots. Even asymptomatic people gotten long term damage. I’m rolling dice shit, I’m going risk mixing vaccines either. Imagine getting J&amp;J finding shouldn’t mix them, you’re locked got. wait best. Gotta watch President's Day bump though. TV blowout sales super spreader events! deaths hospitalizations crater rest us recover home, transmission doesn’t matter. agree completely.  


And get wrong, public health appointees messaging improvement year ago, definitely need holistic approach MUCH clearer messaging communication.  


I'm even bashing people messaging right - buy ""They LOVE LOCKDOWNS!"" theories one bit - think they're best sticking core competencies think completely asinine people believe ANYONE capable navigating last year without creating kind mess process. human capable dealing we've dealt with, given information resources we've had.  


It's fine say need better, necessary always want better, makes sense presume malice incompetence unprecedented frankly impossible situation evolves moment moment. I’m J&amp;J trial. certainly get mRNA vaccine it’s available  ‘There reason believe vaccines reduce transmission rates.’ director Vanderbilt University's Vaccine Research empirical evidence taken time fun know tomorrow be.

But man...really miss gym. plan go back April - lift, cardio home. still may numbers keep going down, looking like I'll wait vaccine. There's nothing suggest fourth wave. Cases declining rapidly, weather improving, vaccine distribution going well. worst small uptick cases people vaccinated virus already start behaving normally. 

I see would re-institute restrictions fall. Everyone wants vaccine one then. plenty people talked love anonymity masks, hides insecurities like acne bad teeth, masks help social. Maybe that's told anymore.

""We need cases 1000 per day""

""We need ICU drop x level""

""Now need worry variants know little about""

They keep finding reasons keep us lockdown. 5 months. Enough enough already.

I live Toronto. Trump trying close incoming travel March though.  seemed concerned it. Trump know then? Like get frustration people able get appointment. However also realize literally every single person world wants (well ok lol). seen data vaccinations up. see cases going down.

End day course want vaccine sooner rather later. long rates still going up, herd immunity go still net positive protected herd immunity then.

I hope I'm coming standoffish, think lot people talking past here. matters prediction right wrong, ignore prediction without making judgement one way helpful anyone's cause.

OMG can't tell what's satire anymore. person you’re responding to, looked Bloomberg article posted. really picked line response ignored rest it. specifically talks don’t know virus transmission post vaccine. Also reduce transmission rates clearly doesn’t mean eliminate transmission. also talks continuing wear masks. Logically reduces transmission since symptomatic patients transmit highest. one going take leap eliminates transmission don’t know. 1/20 get vaccinated still get symptomatic infection people could still transmit. 


The reality 95% effectiveness vaccine going great. need get community levels enough 1/20 significant risk. Getting people vaccinated that. take months. problem many scientists pandemic, Fauci particular. Scientists aren’t good understanding media take 5 minute long, nuanced response condense 5 second sound bite focused scariest emotional-reaction eliciting part.

OK, let's cherrypick, let's look top list rather unfair pick two gigantic states treated differently media. [The top five states per capita COVID-19 deaths New York

2. New Jersey

3. Rhode Island

4. Massachusetts

5. Mississippi

I say that's terribly consistent narrative ""if wore masks, would now"" arbitrarily strict rules things like going gyms effective measures preventing COVID-19 deaths.

The pronouncements coming people like Robinson science - little interest testable hypotheses. granting rely extent natural experiments different policies across locales controlling factors, still seems clear actually reacting results rejecting hypotheses inconsistent facts ground. can’t explain Florida worse is. don’t know why,” Castrucci told Healthline. “We discount little word novel, right [in novel coronavirus]? We’re still learning lot virus.”

Right, agreed Castrucci, punch line actually idea talking recommend given set restrictions, novel listen people play dress experts. Yeah I'm here, appear signup trial right now. wonder mainly running SA. read article. day second doses elderly less severe first older people. mentioned early elderly person mild reaction second shot context reactions people place.

Seems like father dodged bullet there. still miss gym doe course mention gunshot deaths included data. I’ve volunteer work NYC cancelled end summer already. don’t want extra people around even they’ve vaccinated. 20 million number included 45 million number since said ""1 doses""? Bullshit call bullshit agree would excellent information. Moderna niche vaccine US market. Very, doses administered outside US sure quantities like UK Israel see Pfizer AZ. people gotten vaccines US see results Moderna too. Yes. 

Pfizer gave Israel bunch doses understanding they’d run tests. I'm even gonna argue you, clearly pro-shut-in antisocial agenda listen evidence contradicts ideology. impossible make masks dehumanizing

Maybe ramp production clear masks? [Look Figure 4 phase 3 95.6% effective 18-65 group, 86.4% effective 65+ group. still great numbers, surprising efficacy falls age. CDC says infections reported factor 4.6x. would put hospitalization rate bit 1% never New Zealand... USA better federal control now, massive helped stabilize pandemic country somewhat competent administration denial virus. Brazil, still mess crazy Trump power yet, driving misinformation masses like leader western countries. 3,000 died age 25 35 it’s like it’s impossible. would lend like half dozen type deaths occurring Israel, likely made news agree. Clickbait let's forget 80M untested infections. No?!?! I'm shocked!!  Reddit. people can't lift bar gym and/or like it, replace workouts dumbbell cardio. 

Gyms easy target theory, regardless data show them. There's going one exposure place gathering (especially considering anyone read article, they'd know HIIT likely mask-less class). 

It's daunting arguing people. True much gym membership cost year? 2 years? 3? time $800 pay itself. fast happens depends cost gym is. How's that's going work schools around windows open windows all. Let's forget broken AC/heaters  plenty areas California refuse follow governors orders allowed many open. Several sheriffs refused follow orders. Poor kids bright talented white kids Covid case rate NYC fallen 50% since January, new variant increasing prevalence. So. alarming, case rates falling? understand. also need acknowledge got nowhere near worst case scenarios anywhere world. scariest models US showed deaths 3m, despite US bad job ~40% Americans get Covid we’ve 500k Covid deaths maybe 300-400k excess deaths. almost at-risk people vaccinated April, we’ll exiting pandemic shortly (although endemic Covid probably exist forever many similar illnesses exist occasionally kill frail). 

Not exactly ‘good news’, significantly better originally feared possible.  Oh, option piece FP? Pass. Except media business dishonest institution. don’t think reddit users dislike gym. article brings light lot people public gyms seem follow mask regulations based stories reading. fucking shit. No. problem science isn’t even finished. media running story. “Try something new”  Dude, go visit now! correction, regions equally autonomous. regional constitutions determine powers have. healthcare education system, Basque Country Navarra treasury taxation, plus Catalonia police force.

Nobody cares “disappears.” it’s longer emergency, stop treating like one. get waiting months people vaccinated, we’ll never get covid 0, don’t need to. live covid existing.

How think herd immunity works doesn’t slow spread? Yes doesn’t prevent spread entirely definitely 100% slows I'm sure people used realize- thank comment link! quarantine

Sort of, people. millions needed move hotels, stay friends, go shelters, etc. vaccine based things historically said I'm guessing get it. 

I part recent conversation sounds like interpretation went.

I can't project months think long time I'm comfortable kids around unvaccinated adults. propose rest world?

I’ve edited post reflect American position. Let know y’all start celebrating thanksgiving I'm university student cognitive dissonance among peers unreal. Everyone know social circle least 4 5 households yet still say lockdowns absolutely necessary long takes covid deaths always sicknesses infectious covid restriction necessary reduce spread. problem isn’t it’s super deadly spreads like crazy even low death/hospitilizarions rate it’s still causing insane amount damage society. Pre covid damage done infectious disease wasn’t zero wasn’t high enough validate closures. point gyms open unlikely event cases skyrocket vaccination completed might make sense reimpose restrictions. think rules safety tbh, vaccine short supply currently. everyone offered vaccine risk severely pissing majority people vaccinated yet.

Vaccinated people would able see family friends, they'd first line new jobs. rules need place everyone opportunities. course wait hospitals good shape, still people hospilized last summer, waiting month two good policy.

That said, it. thing that's wrong here: we're shutting stop cases, we're keep hospitals good shape. Hard fucking stop.

So, matter kids can't vaccinated? kids filling hospitals breaking point? they're not, spread matter vaccines arms teachers.

And OK invokes contact tracing, good thing....but get point need spread locally right? likely happen another 2+ years.....we distancing locking zero local cases....we Lockdown get contract tracing going, hospitals.

So, may wait I'm vaccinated take risks personally, point I'm longer worried going anything vaccines keep hospitals good shape. That's hypothetical, that's I'm going behaving. 

The shut distanced keep Healthcare system afloat. rate decline obviously slowed. Dammit miss gym much, way I’m going back I’m vaccinated. Oh certain exit, eventually. first pandemic history end socially people done it. vaccines best tool speed process up. I’ve noticed lot people sub don’t understand big deal virus variants keep hearing about. 

It won’t make difference personally variant catch. Even you’re vaccinated, you’ll probably enough protection avoid worst outcomes infection. 

It’s public health officials plans thrown confusion. They’re ones deciding restrictions needed stop outbreak given many people need vaccinate things go back normal. 

But UK variant that’s transmissible? need vaccinate 80% population instead 70%. SA variant dropped vaccine efficacy 95% 60%? Suddenly vaccination alone isn’t going get herd immunity. strain reinfect 50% people naturally acquired immunity instead 10%? Suddenly lot vectors transmission worry yesterday. 

I see many people saying don’t care variants vaccine protect them, they’re missing huge impact variant public health response outbreak. Yeah. Maybe variant hard contain spread started? None countries vaccinated many people. think it’s people don’t think things actually possibility turning corner year disease death. want to, reason, believe won’t ever get pandemic stage. don’t realize pandemic lasted forever eventually end. don’t see would different need better guidelines vaccinated since still permitted things according public health experts there’s herd immunity. Again, exactly two western countries true: US UK.

Everyone else, Europe, Canada, speak Third World even remotely close end via vaccine needs alternative concept soon possible. It’s still less likely We're likely already seeing start spring wave. Average cases back rising several weeks improvements. way likely avoid wave mass vaccination, US vaccine roll slowed significantly week variety factors. Please stay safe get vaccinated soon can. Wonder anybody help question - parents got second dose Pfizer vaccine week ago got blood test spike protein antibodies yesterday. mom around 6000 u/ml dad 14 u/ml . test says anything 0.8 u/ml indicates immunity wondering could possibly cause large difference. also mean dad gained almost protection vaccine?  Instead shot arm, they've shot foot. change fact eating indoors objectively terrible idea could problem still could pass virus non vaccinated people asymptomatic transmission. league doesn’t require do, can’t imagine make helmet cage mouthpiece mask work Well, can't mask skepticism without mask mandates first place. can't mask mandates without mask supporters.   Hi!! Astrazeneca LIII study designed differently Moderna Biontech think - sense kept testing patients throughout, whereas two tested patient became symptomatic.

NY Times even broken county. places go state. county extremely high risk level reported average daily rate 45 cases per 100,000 people past two weeks. county fewer cases may also category 10 percent tests positive result past two weeks. mean county testing enough, number cases may county high risk level reported average daily rate 11 cases per 100,000 people past two weeks. county fewer cases may also category 10 percent tests positive result past two weeks. mean county testing enough, number cases may undercounted. confirm part sports. figure skate wear mask practice. Even though none us elite skaters continuously throw triples quads, it’s fun. don’t pairs skaters ice dance teams club either, it’s pretty easy everyone distanced thing. 

Somehow hockey players rink get without masks, makes even BS. Either required everybody nobody. 

I tolerate masks stores use completing Instacart deliveries even never see customer. can’t wait never wear one skate freely. state’s mandate expires, masks going garbage. legitimate concern numbers massaged political purposes however

I think there's possible chance case numbers slightly modified, there's way death numbers could fudged meaningful way. think they’ve going back forth. groups doubled stances result one another. like sudden ""schools safe"" narrative even though nothing fundamentally changed pandemic. CDC put good numbers guidance schools, based trash data schools extreme pressure cook books COVID spread.

Just CDC says havent exposed spent 14 minutes within 6 feet positive person instead 15 minutes doesnt make true give shield sneeze random passerby let out. You’re fine long get 2-3 weeks probably possibly even longer. shouldn’t scheduled Pfizer 4 weeks apart begin with. It’s 3 week regimen Especially one wears mask. local gym tiny stopped going beginning pandemic. never closed never required masks. N95 situation still completely unacceptable. previous administration knew needed ramp production, yet still whole. Yes ordered masks, manufacturers produce many masks materials. refused contract meltblown fabric production, lead shortage N95s everywhere recently. fully vaccinated still transmit others aren’t. Wait another 3-4 months going full normal. choir practice working gym? It'll kill two birds one stone! majority population money, people it. use investment. Investing live entertainment industry worth risk, rather invest ways.

When comes culture, money simply gone. see yourself, give time.  Texas shots part last week, counties said they’re 2nd shots week make last. 

Though, vaccine centers lost power vaccinate people immediately. really hope used going vaccinations there? correct. Sadly, it’s yet widely available school staff members. also takes full month (at minimum) get fully vaccinated. 

Also, kids parents household members get vaccine? kid gets mild case brings home, what- Einstein? start getting protection first jab week two shot. 20% country thought nothing completely unnecessary. idiots, 20% people side decided believe masks could end pandemic.

Are sure getting causation correlation right? guess, latter group probably came first, former. think person responding right, here. right blithely bash media fronts, especially light post-Trump era. 

However, media made major mistakes pandemic contributed situation right. Using language like ""The rates spiking! "" describe mild increases virus winter, leading sort ""Yeah yeah heard before"" dangerous times arrived. Additionally new variants concern, headlines make one new catastrophe right (even content articles portrays numbers accurately). 

Good journalism indeed matter. seen lot bad journalism last year, too. Sanitizing equipment thing even without covid, want gross sweat machines use I’ll honest. work school, open since sept masks required kids. adults ones got sick, two kids total get Covid. adults vaccinated, kids far less risk fall fine. 

Our staff mostly vaccinated. went close doors twice due adult cases, zero illness last month. Maybe wait 2-3 weeks see efficacy loosen   always sicknesses around held view people ""have right spread it"" everyone would locked house released health officials passed battery tests.

Is COVID worse flu? Yes. 'so bad' need crush people's freedom movement? No. Masks public places fine pandemic going on, idea risks must removed public spots opening insanity. “LeArN cOdE!” &lt;&lt;sarcastically shocked nick cage another strain Florida... logic... think see problem. “Typically, person’s second rendezvous pathogen much milder, pose less transmission threat.

Many long haulers symptoms identical CFS fibromyalgia. turns underlying cause illnesses previously unknown viral vector, might lead effective treatments. government/hospital hacks trying keep peace don’t want hear logical dissenting opinions.

Public health point hospital capacity best you. really disheartened article NYT morning calling new variant worrisome insinuating it’s ripping BIPOC neighborhoods killing younger people. end, last couple paragraphs, truth: 

“People recovered coronavirus vaccinated likely able fight variant off, there’s doubt that,” said. “they may get little bit sick it.”

They may also infect others keep virus circulating, might delay herd immunity, added.

But experts slightly optimistic. “These things little bit less well controlled vaccine, it’s orders magnitude down, would terrify me,” Dr. Read said.

As virus continues evolve, vaccines need tweaked, “but scheme things, aren’t huge worries compared vaccine,” Dr. Read said. “I’d say glass three-quarters full, compared last year.”

[NYT article NYC  get sicker year pre COVID great shape going gym regularly.  read it, check [the crazy shit cut Event I'm still planning go Scotland July. Stupid comment, there's little evidence gyms problematic long precautions followed. 

But yeah, gib upvotes right? estimate many cases first wave actually US, amount deaths time match many cases had? Beuaracrats, wait another week fill paperwork. He's going to. I've driven around wear one caused big fight us times. fully understand logic. main benefit test know going sick not. can't know test anyway hand, there's nothing getting sick anyway. get sick, go hospital regardless tested positive not.

No, main benefit testing know avoid people infect (eg. go work, see unvaccinated grandma). vaccine eliminate chance spreading disease, makes sense still test yourself. vaccine blocks also spreading absolutely point testing. 

Of course pretty much everyone vaccinated vaccination eliminates risk serious illness, nobody needs go testing information positive test matter anything anyone. guess even point testing would useful scientists studying spread virus, think people may willing burden much purpose. must go la fitness too. switched franchise gym goers consistently lazy inconsiderate I’ve seen twenty years going gym. fact gym pandemic putting people risk. Pessimism equated intelligence, optimism naivety, people. wish would test frequently answer asymptomatic vaccinated spreader question.... lot restrictions effective people think source that? I’m fascinated want read more. lived NYC radiator hotter sun, would bother turn on. International travel quite far off. people kick scream thought “going back normal.” people love anti-social nature “quarantines” mask mandates. people genuinely terrified PTSD fear virus perpetuated here. Whoops you’re right. It’s 29M infections, thought 40M. That’s 3.4% hospitalization rate. Since 1M number article wss November, let’s say it’s 5% hospitalization rate since infections lower. goto mma gym. local small. masks required basically restrictions. pretty great. never gotten trouble area rural. one covid outbreak. It’s going voted today tomorrow House move Senate. things might get dicey, like minimum wage increases might change cut. Democrats trying pass without get Republicans board via budget reconciliation, still moderate democrats get board make challenging pass.   room full sweat exhaled breath mouth breathers sanitary ? could guessed ? “26 year old people randomly die time let’s assume died disease killed half million Americans year disease” Fauci high level politician 37 years. There's really excuse still know talk public. We're talking PhD candidate.

Also, scientist, really hard. talking public entertain pathological edge cases. give ""95% confidence interval"". yearly covid shots covid RNA correction vaccines target protein make virus impotent mutate. Much like could get brain aneurysm way work, could mutate past vaccine, like brain aneurysm probably really worth thinking about. think it’s caution. Optimism future good throwing caution wind optimism might set backwards. Nobody saying magically disappear year restrictions lockdowns clear messaging get lifted, people throwing arms air saying bother?

The messaging abysmal vaccines. way played absolutely insane messaging like *Even vaccinated still can't go back normal.*

I can't blame people saying I'll take chances.  France Germany already problems debating locking things again. Right?

Pretty sure last March. way know sure though wasn’t allowed testing &amp; every doctor closed. 
I everything fever &amp; cough.

Probably it. Spouse too. Probably LOT folk exactly same. really: recently majority received Pfizer shot. Oxford/AstraZeneca jab come past two weeks supplies Pfizer vaccine currently low factory I've going gym since reopened. Everybody wears masks z everybody bottle disinfectant everybody sprays everything cleans. feel pretty safe there. also bc many tourists catch covid Florida test positive back home state. new administration took over, domestic travel bans discussed, Florida California short list. discussed genetic sequencing would ramped follow covid spread domestically, Florida officials freaked out. idea domestic restrictions quickly dismissed many reasons.

I live Key West, we're overrun tourists, many residents staying far away. know 6 deaths tourists passed covid weeks KW vacations, clusters tied visitors. much dare speak ill J&amp;J vaccine sub, you’ll downvoted called piece shit.

AZ enters conversation... imagine Cuomo president? We'd 2.5M+ dead. tried make sense public health messaging - bottom line Fauci rest looking everything *pandemic* level. zoomed-out macro view right jobs. yet much data vaccine impact *transmission*, data mostly focused safety symptoms. epidemiologist concern possibility vaccinated people may still spread transmissible disease, perpetuating pandemic, even reduced degree, allowing virus chances mutate. 

I tell parents vaccinated get together home pizza party something, going dinner likely require masks transmission potential. messaging dogshit, blame two reasons; 1. Epidemiologists want look individual cases give approvals, 2. News organizations work fear.  NPR run story saying that. You’re lying. don’t start fucking honest.  Haha okay, consider ""enough"" death tolerate? making things ferment outrage. example, vaccinated member family vaccinated, someone that's lived you, actually without mask? sit give hug things like that? answer likely, course, can,"" Fauci include dependents? Guess he’s never heard expression, failure plan plan fail! work senior home outbreak January manager building Human Resources person heard talking covid spread aerosol literally yelled told spreading rumours. told CDC recognized fact literally followed trying leave building try make admit lying. 

60 people ended getting covid manager ended using vaccines meant healthcare workers receptionist. agree. work healthcare school. days mask 16 hours, double masked. see excuse. Seems tongue cheek me. Like “I’m saying name can’t sue me,” recognizing would never actually tragic said died covid, died necessarily covid. Still need details. 1 million hospitalizations 40 million infections. Obesity sedentarism risk factors many diseases including Covid. people really get motivated exercise gym, others need gym exercise, others get motivated all, gym not, little exercise. Gyms higher risk areas also tangible benefits health first group, must balance depending circumstances. guess belong second group, that's case congratulations. gone forever.  Lots us still waiting vaccines, aren’t totally sure whether lucky ones still spread us. you’re getting close fully vaccinated people still distancing everyone else? That’s great! Thanks thoughtful. you’re like “lol don’t care,” well, maybe spare thought rest us? No, data that. Personally makes unlikely accept J&amp;J vaccine I'm thinking preventing symptoms entirely (like mRNA options) likely prevent long covid. It’s insane we’ve gotten point people cheering government strong arming small businesses want go gym deny fact they're COVID hotspots.

A lot people relied gyms manage mental well-being. loss enough people deny they're hotspots transmission. amount people vaccinated country (UK) people want open soon, regardless. children 15 someone know. No. No, can't.  Piggly wiggly. strange grocery store name.;) point makes zero sense. 

Why would people want 'defund state schools' care schools open?

The main people clamouring get schools back open asap parents groups, people 'have never schools forefront mind'. Certainly here, main political voice behind (Labour) former First Minister, ex-secondary school teacher. doubt wants 'defund state schools', certainly hid well decades. 

They plenty serious academics people involved children's health welfare corner. 

These real concerns can't (somehow, even though makes sense) dismissed 'lol evil Conservatives want dismantle state'.

I mean, England Conservatives schools still closed another two weeks whilst Scotland (nominally, really centrish populist) left-wing SNP partially open week already. party political issue, issue balance competing needs.

Teaching unions exist represent teachers disputes pay conditions. jobs seeking minimise risk teachers getting COVID. that's teaching unions run education system - one part machine, focused one thing. pupils' needs part remit.

The teachers know pretty split issue. sister (a primary school teacher) dead set going back vaccinated. MIL (secondary school) desperate get back asap vehemently schools closed all. mother (recently retired) happy whatever government decide. also worth noting we're witnessing science unfolding real time breakneck pace

I REALLY wish people understood this... I'm fucking tired people accusing scientists ""lying"" ""flip-flopping"" things like masks, etc. literally scientific method. works. like *ignore* new data/conclusions inconvenient current narrative. Haha love it, I'm stealing that! Yes. Yes, do. Gotta keep people government scared enough keep small business closed bit longer else check NYT got Wal-Mart clear yes germans completely different situation us, global pandemic gym $100 month  Per cdc report, gym allowed patrons remove mask exercising. Report defines infrequent mask use wearing mask ≤60% time class , majority class participants met criteria infrequent mask use.

I frustrated still stupid society. see videos exercise class gym another state participants wear mask way class take exercising. nonsense. we're point masks required every public place, I'm 100% compliant that. chance person actively shedding COVID given time low anyway; wear mask, wear mask, linger around one another beyond crossing paths store, I'm going giving COVID.

If gym, decided worth risk (we still wear masks, btw). can't people choose that? Again, flu season, exact argument applies. Yes there's widely available flu vaccine; even effective COVID vaccines are. weeks ago meeting like trying start back via like zoom meet person sounds really dumb imo. idk would even work proportional population many excess teacher deaths there? bet isn’t statistically significant. _is_ job fix it. We’re child generation anymore, 25-39 yrs old buck passing us. Baby boomers finally starting retire move way Early pandemic, realized going keep elementary-aged kid seeing friends, since live tightly packed kid-filled neighborhood. since kids mixing, parents inevitably mixed well. godsend mental health sit outside chat adults, share beers, etc. think husband logged wow nearly every day spent time ever guild discord. movie nights, random games break up, drinking nights, name it. It’s total life saver. always favorite part gym debate.

Yes, let find way get squat rack, barbell, plates 3rd floor one-bedroom apartment continue workouts home. Let's also conveniently ignore costs set-up fact at-home equipment still incredibly hard find days....   1. important remember COVID flu all. Flu caused influenza virus, mutate significantly, understand mechanisms flu propagates spent decades effectively coming treatments. Something like Tamiflu work Coronavirus lacks neuraminidase receptors require inhibit studies SARS-COV-2 virus shown flu treatment ineffective coronaviruse, continues case COVID. 

2. eradicated Smallpox. vaccines Diphtheria, Polio, Pertussis, many natural diseases that, treatment, killed millions people every year. never cure literally every disease. genetically modified rice fight vitamin deficiency impoverished nations. added iodine salt combat iodine deficiency. cure every disease ever ever exist make appreciable impact longevity person's life and, result, viability passing genes otherwise may died natural causes.

3. I'm willing put mask. I'm willing talk people phone internet maintain reasonable distance must see them. I'm willing quarantine 10 days suspect come contact virus, understand may yet, forever. understand that, things continue current trajectory, may another year. willing accept inconveniences wearing mask avoiding non-essential contact another year could well save someone's life.  citizens first shot, need vaccine passports? did, actually certify vaccine can't take them. want know need prepare kids another school year masks, plexi glass, recess.

The fact though know. Scientists saying ""oh yeah everything def fine fall"" would pretending know things don't.

Our predictions slowly getting confident optimistic data point patient accept future still somewhat uncertain. feel safe around May, stay away May. I'm open fact eligible vaccine April-June plan get ASAP.

I wear mask public places keep distance strangers. want catch something that, statistically, I'm probably carrying one given time, stay away me. really simple.  Same, really miss choir peeps.  Yeah, bit Survivors guilt Idk diagnosed ADD early 2000’s Concern vaccine’s ability prevent chronic symptoms (“long covid”) legitimate concern currently studied reputable organizations like Johns Hopkins. See linked article below. 

Note asymptomatic mild infections still producing problems. number impacted people truly around 10% (as article quotes University Pennsylvania physician studying problem), that’s *millions* people need potentially life long care. 

The scientists simply know yet effective vaccines area. We’re one massive live “study”, people placing bets. 🤷‍♀️

[Verge: Scientists want know vaccinated people still become covid long haulers BMI reveal? God Trump he'd eviscerated. Hate Trump true. entire article hacked together mess I'm sure editor spent even five minutes it.   concerned infection counts? death count along, low vaccinations? concerned infection counts respiratory diseases. hell sentence even mean? 


""It appears evade, somewhat, body's response vaccines, well. becoming common."" &lt;- mean antibodies? mean? antibodies vaccination? 


I understand essentially mutation (same mutation see SA mutation) binds easily human cells evade immunity somewhat (from prior infection vaccines) data also seems show vaccines confer significant level protection hospitalization death. Especially mRNA vaccines widespread deployment nationwide. 


Why entire article reference strain California strain without mentioning average reader IDEA actually going on. 


Do want widespread SA/Cali/NY variants? - look like make people sicker evade degree immunity past infections - media really needs figure communicate situations properly. article completely lacks context. 


If could stop blogifying news would great. want dumb down, dumb down, still accurate provide basic background.

I need news sunshine rainbows come on.  Philippines covid; people litterally starving. 

After COVID measures mean right? COVID causing economic damage (only would unable work dead). bring vaccine passports. let jealous young people make think form discrimination.

And next pandemic primarily kills old people young people say ""Don't let jealous old people make think form discrimination isolate themselves"".  mean 99% chance killing someone?

Trains like, one thing allowed give 20th century Germany credit for, even good. industry spokeswoman said, ""The gyms need make money. course, people die.""  Well judging “no judgement free zone” top that, college athletes testing COVID regularly. Y’a ok going hard pill swallow - world revolve around you. reason lockdown measures strict world full people think like you, i.e. 'me first' 'I've mine cares', 'I know anyone died can't bad'. vaccine magic cure stops virus existing, simply gives immune system necessary training effectively deal virus. virus 'disappear' overnight large proportion population got vaccinated. hope suppress virus controllable levels. virus caused serious problem, primarily due asymptomatic spread, shear arrogance western cultures led virus thriving seen mutate. time take unnecessary risks close getting upper hand frankly exhausting battle. I've vaccinated, continue isolate, socially distance follow guidance lockdown winter could end functioning life far many us. fed this, mentally draining - anxiety depression everywhere, no-ones actually enjoying this. get grip - masks protect others, you. vaccinate everyone lethal diseases protect can't get vaccinated real health reasons (herd immunity), vaccination protect everyone, you. things can't wait do, safe literally hug shit mother, risk lives others so.

that's point Another shoe dropped. How's gonna week given 7-day average cases increasing last 3 days?  way vaccines handled U.S. UK. Governments shield vaccine makers lawsuits way getting vaccines quickly cheaply. close worst exceptions...?  think also can't understated caution part experts mixes people's inability communicate semi complex realities makes mess everything. 


We news talking different strains emerging without making obvious Brazil/South Africa/California/New York apparently notable basic mutation. context, one problem solve right mutation cause vaccines ineffective. communicate that, suddenly least FIVE (counting UK) scary variants mutating spreading.  


Just like can't get anywhere cohesive message vaccination. 

You accurate easily understood say ""Getting approved vaccine gets us back normal."" cut kids hugging Grandma smiling classroom drawing picture cat crayons. ""Hospitalizations Moderna/Pfizer/J&amp;J: 0. Hospitalizations without: XXX,XXX""  


We experts - like Fauci - exhibiting kind messaging concern expect scientist - things like hug grandma vaccinated probably. kind \* end optimism may scientific - speak absolutes without data -but time seems damaging population large. 


We huge number people depressed, demotivated, convinced we're foreseeable future. science problem right now, hope problem. People need story, need reality, need roadmap. history, can-do attitudes came leaders gave people mission. Rosie Rivieter, Uncle Sam's ""I WANT YOU!"" campaign, WW2 rationing ""Victory Gardens."". Yeah, call propaganda - propaganda extremely dangerous - that. message, gave us degree cohesion, gave everyman woman something believe scary unknown time. ""keep calm carry on"" moment.

Sorry rant. mind weeks guess article gave push. Going gym get healthy reduce risk dying obesity related health concerns makes worth going despite risk COVID me. Won’t deny it’s huge cesspool COVID though, definitely is. never happen, would interesting see would happen long term US gained mask culture like Asian countries. people like able see smiles.

Masks uncomfortable it’s hot (ironically southern states ones opposed mask wearing hmmmmh)

Masks uncomfortable wearing work play sports. know people requiring hockey football players wear masks idea manage that.

Also, wear masks eat, makes eating restaraunts difficult relatively lucky. birthday March 8th. missed lockdown week I’ll take pfizer eyeball 👁. trying get rise. 

While agree risk individuals low, risk everyone else Karens claiming vaccinated (with way everyone else verify it) still high.

In addition, unlucky 5% vaccine thing, potentially vulnerable future. 2,5 million people died year?

WTF about? Good news laws! vaccine take vitamins. Just... wow. 

Laying groundwork kids see least one party vaccinated (kids laws). That's line right now.  pandemic really shown hinging mental health single thing exists beyond control largely depends people terrible mental health strategy.

Just tell numbers metrics go back normal? said early fall cutoff May. messaging change May I'm done. caution precautions me. wonder change public health approach flu going forward. course lockdowns school closures harmful keep with, doesn’t mean aren’t things learn lesson severity flu seasons going forward.

Better sick leave policies work school absence policies schools well general shift towards people understanding stay home they’re sick keep safe could help. Masks could required flu season airports settings people contact vulnerable people, visitors hospitals nursing homes. Flu testing could also get common routine people jobs put frequently contact elderly.

Before approach fighting flu US constantly asking people wash hands I’m skeptical ever significant effect. Telling people something doesn’t guarantee they’ll even get people wash hands several times day doesn’t mean won’t touch face between. might also overestimated often flu actually transmitted via surfaces anyway masks seem pretty effective know Covid really easy find viral RNA, doesn’t mean necessarily infectious. didn’t say that. course change fiber life around vaccinated people. people don’t option yet people complaining public health officials advocating silly. We’re 14% vaccinated. Patience key. takes 3 weeks kick in. That’s why. agree. always want best. 50-60% efficacy doesn’t give sense security. mask wait get pfizer moderna vaccine. see ""six fold reduction antibodies"" paragraph ""retains sufficient immunity"" whatever, math works. take much immunity, immune system highly capable.

If mind tagging get additional information /r/COVID19, I'd like link say. Also, careful say ""my mom"" ""my dad"" sub, say ""two people"". They're pretty strict personal stuff.  Well yeah, they've locked rooms visitors they're vaccinated so... exactly UK variant messed up, already taken capital city area infections started spike rather hard weeks, hence actions. That’s news me. didn’t know vaccines got child prevent hospitalizations. always thought prevent sickness, PERIOD. look excess deaths stories hear Texas sound like superspreading quarantine. Everyone gathered together neighbors single room several days warmth, going check every neighbor... depending common could work way describe. 

Cases flat week accelerating decline months. could due delayed testing three day weekend last week though. safe say people bars restaurants give two shits whether catch not. vaccinated person obligation protect them, they're making chances someone catching slightly higher considering unvaccinated people. Sure, wear mask grocery store, vaccinated people able risky activity choose guilt free, whether going bar house party large gathering. There's way nursing homes actual infection rate higher general population. 

They high *confirmed* case rate people nursing homes much likely die general population Covid almost always manifest least symptomatic demographic. Let's make five call deal. People seen TV shows hero figures solution illness everyone cure end episode. hard accept real world work way.  Chinese vaccine, AstraZeneca one? Canada, friends family I’ve talked either wait pay Pfizer/Moderna ones AZ. wants 2nd rate vaccine. Valentine's bump? throw love orgy something?  headline bill mandate VA medical centers supply vaccine every veteran requests one, allows local leaders continue make decisions priority groups receive vaccine first. would offer flexibility going beyond group veterans actively using VA medical care. vaccine available, would it. it’s not. something works VASTLY better. settle? I’ve looking gym like while. Stopped going mine required masks, people weren’t wearing wearing wrong, gym didn’t really care. Wasn’t worth left. Cases started increasing area doubled - even careful, isolated, etc. work consists lot field work even see people, outside, distanced, wearing masks. 

I go gynecologist she’s literally telling always goes gym, doesn’t wear mask neither anyone else. Oh it’s ok, goes 4 it’s pretty much empty. know gym. They’re notorious wearing masks cleaning anything down.

I tested positive week later. pissed. new real world data coming vaccines, update whether vaccinated still spread virus?  “Experts” post comment removed suitable r/coronavirus.

Please know alone frustration many people feel same. glad venting finding space share thoughts unfortunately, remove comment best-suited sub type discussion.

It’s choosing dying grandpa dying. rest comment 100% spot on. know reporting AstraZeneca looking supplying EU US plant, US plant Canada getting AstraZeneca vaccines (in April, assuming Canada approves AstraZeneca then...) guess it’s largely going make 90 million shortfall from. youre actually braindead think theres difference cardio without mask. obvious dont work lmao supply increase ones want. fear scheduling appointment vaccine, waiting ages come, find J&amp;J vaccine going shoot arm. lose place line shit. booked tickets Italy September prices still low. Hoping actually get go!! 🤞🤞  know, came riding horse like Gandalf White, slammed staff told virus ""You're done!"" Lol. Leadership nothing it. vaccines holidays affected cases.  poor, lifetime bad diet uncontrolled medical conditions hit hard Covid. don’t understand Health Agencies ignoring fact. Get people start taking care eating veggies instead fried crap. Oh! misread thought $230 single weight. bad! Honestly? Humans gross. lot people wash hands using bathroom, handling kids' diapers, etc. think done top, also think made people aware germs unsanitary lot things are. helps hygiene future scaling back extreme cleaning, I'm okay it. know parents would wipe kitchen windex (if that) cloth. never used disinfectant despite raw meat place. use sanitizing wipes cooking. think helps children well.

Ready downvotes 🤷 chance get mRNA vaccine. Sure, it’s moving slow hell, it’s still moving. Get right vaccine time comes, doesn’t make sense? yes, bit like iphone updates. [archive link anyone trouble accessing article Yeah, I'm going far, I'm saying agree, argument there. think people making argument would add ""purposefully"" ""right to"". lmao u even read article? Basically every study far indicated blocks transmission. circulating lot experts CYA say likely true. infected (and vaccine prevents infection) probably can't pass on. That's lot probably's viruses (especially coronaviruses) typically work.

Go ""this typical virus"" want media blown lot information negative way possible.

Don't take word it, course. Wear mask keep distance someone smarter says to. weird cough always lasts forever, can’t afford get sick.

This exactly at. concerns long covid.  Ummm flu vaccine exactly get hospitalized die.  certainly don’t state. Nothing stopping people traveling now. lot people already. time. one wants a-hole gets someone sick

you're asshole even *if* able spread vaccinated got someone sick. we're talking going bars restaurants, safely conclude everyone care get sick not. get sick, caring, you. Places like grocery stores require masks anyways, like get anyone values health sick. There's much stronger evidence prevents spread anyways. Anyway, whatever, really care people lives, extremely frustrating see people *otherwise* could perform risk assessment, override common sense touch expert said see grandkids bc there's microscopic possibility grandkids would catch another microscopic possibility top death. two-faced care grandma, wish sickness upon me. really. ratio oxygen air change taking mask. probably mean Air. Even air molecules tiny enough go cloth still get amount air, ratio oxygen it. basic chemistry. heard articles yes later realized probably fear mongering. 

The talk variants many people confused may get variant increased transmissibility evades vaccines according articles therefore prolonging crisis. US keep pushing back timeline. remember beginning year, Fauci said end summer. Biden chimed said didn’t think would Christmas Fauci came said we’d wearing masks 2022 cited getting “very low, near zero level” cases get back semblance normal. 

I’ve heard people say become voluntary people may wear time time winter months, I’ve heard people talk semblance normal heck even mean? Show said Insistence “I whatever want” you’re vaccinated tempting shortsighted.

The insistence one's vaccination can't taken account scenario also absurd. think many expect entire world open they're vaccinated. DJT: told herd immunity world work. got first Pfizer jab last night. honestly felt pretty emotional end pandemic close. beyond tenderness arm, real side effects (though sleep well last night EXPECTING side effects turn brain off).

so stop double masking go grocery shopping now? wait second jab? thing happened walking alone empty sidewalk Meanwhile ridiculous hygiene theater wiping surfaces continues, air circulation ignored, even though known months airborne fomites main cause transmission. Well, gee, besides fun climbing itself, made remember liked climbing much. Always approachable community gym. Stopped years ago got puppy, I'd love go back post-vaccine. Iew glad able cancel membership gym last April. Actually, yet see anti-masker sub, like ones conspiratorial virus communities. Well he’s now, everyone ELSE responsible stop hiding behind husband's coworker currently sick home COVID along wife work refuses enforce masks. One management came sick, refused wear mask. enforced everywhere. people get others sick. everyone compliant.

Further, people tell friends they're going gym? see friends family masks on? Again, way everyone compliant this. Housing demand also charts US....the country crapped bed came response. difference two countries diversified economy sustain prices tourism entertainment business poised massive rebound second half year NZ remain closed world least end year. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) ruled December mandated (with restrictions).  guy point mask across parking lot ignored kept walking, hear *Where mask? know law one on.*

I outdoors. Alone. Walking home work wearing thing 8 hours. think guidelines vary via state.

And besides guidelines aren’t hard fast rules Personally, I’ll continue wear mask indefinitely contact individuals outside household.

Your choice, respect that. Others choose differently. respect individual decisions. really care. bother. argument get downvoted every single time. get affect others. Phase 2 Cat 3 Nah, guy one rank higher (who thankfully office) blame. one mentioned  looked data even seems uptick. Looks like tide might soon turning favor bad news subreddit guidelines

Note said *guidelines*, mandates.

Just something's *required* mean stop it.

For example, live Florida, Iowa, Montana, continue wear mask indoor public settings, outdoor public settings six feet social distancing cannot maintained, even though there's mask mandate states. Otherwise, putting others risk COVID-19 infection. delusional say sick... healthy? Huh? Ironically, means vaccine actually effective you. immune response means body successfully developed good antibodies COVID-19. vaccinate people demand testing fall cliff. would anyone fully vaccinated go get test odds symptomatic infection next nothing. may still demand driven mandatory testing, think metrics like deaths hospitalizations become far important tests, cases, positivity rates within next month two.   rest Europe gets experience UK months ago.

The difference vaccinated way get vaccines 6 months. fucking Chad viruses Oh wow, expecting month earlier that. We’re almost year it’s widely known airborne virus. Yet many people still obsessed using hand sanitizer wiping everything. Why? need gut public health profession top bottom. Anyone breaks rules? Fired. Anyone can’t explain reopening plans? Fired. Anyone seriously considered “zero-Covid” strategy? Fired. Anyone didn’t consider consequences mandates several weeks implementing them, call people fields like psychology, ethics, etc? Fired. Yes, agree. Masks pleasant, can't see others' faces everything.

However, necessary. issue mask mandates 2020, pandemic would ravaged society even more.

Now, question might wondering is, ""which better trade-off: reduced public safety lack masks, hampered social skills regular masks?"" I'm pretty sure that's rhetorical question. It’s theater it’s worst thing. don’t feel like people need obsessive positive side effect help reduce spread common cold flu. I’m biased view pre-pandemic hand sanitizer car use going stores always desk. Yes yes yes. Luckily live community good amount money I’m hoping get good air filtration system. they’re talking outdoor classes spring weather permits. communities don’t lot money? need focus getting better ventilation systems already dated schools. yes, said don’t need worry groceries wiped cut hand sanitizer obsession like half. really breath. There's term that: Flinstoning!

It's project present-day knowledge, beliefs customs onto humans lived past, albeit usually within context archeology lol PA requires gyms would surprised found rural gyms required them. Many even close mid-Dec early-Jan shutdown.  Great hear! Crossing fingers goes well! Fucking experts “opinions” lack plan led 500,000 Covid deaths, counting. different approach? headline says. Idk op left purpose reddits generator Checking efficacy data J&amp;J like half dose AZ (what else could platform).  really suitable someone lazy give fuck something hard reach rural areas challenging get even once. time available widely plenty Thank this. spot on. I'm tired entire social circle tired. know anyone thinks good situation. I'm focused trying get parents vaccinated breathe little easier around them. want see friends (I 2 willing see space meetings appropriately see anyone else).

I anything birthday husband's birthday. Missed 2 sets parents' birthdays family members. nephew played his. cancel 2 trips. None enjoyable. 

I feel like vitriol side (i.e. people would downvote you) people like us love home anti-social think great. want cautious enough end mean like it. unless trials real world. Okay flu vaccines effective J&amp;J vaccine. I’m sure us choice would get one mRNA vaccines, offered J&amp;J one today would get. even pedantic point view necessarily safe. One might asymptomatic shedder (even vaccinated) one not, could make shedder also, returns home unvaccinated relatives spreads it.

Until hard proof vaccinated people acquire shed virus (note vaccine results speak serious symptoms hospitalization/ICU/etc) makes sense - even sounds like overkill. strict vs ""i'm safe they're safe therefore safe"", secondary circle people respectively come contact afterwards might endanger even though *you* vaccinated, simply could carry shed even can't get hooks deeply you.

Or risk it. calculated risk, one makes call. would guess there's high probability absolutely nothing wrong happen, health professionals type endorse crossing one's fingers... usually. Hence things sound like ridiculous overkill. can't use excuse ""Well, X number people don't/do feel way!"".  
This reasoning critical thinking skills necessary.  


If we're going go numbers, humans eating garbage shit, 500 quadrillion flies can't wrong! Right?  


"" us going getting rid asap probably even using much mandates say to. "" 
\^ know realize that's best reason keep mask mandates!!  


I still can't get fact many people's reactions are: ""I can't possibly wear mask save lives! inconvenient! infringing rights harm others!"" 


Why hard wear mask safety everyone involved? truly *can't* wear mask (and making lying worthless, uncaring, sociopathic POS), there's always delivery, take out, curb side service options, etc., yes? Go live one"
