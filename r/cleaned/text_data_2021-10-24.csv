Take person wrote article. Stick Moderna. booster half (50mcg) dose 2 original shots 100mcg each... Moderna booster half original dose 50mcg instead 100.... Yep. news it’s also infection immunity wanes time? Clearly solution nothing. like nothing treat illness ever, eventually patient going die eventually something. /s  Even FDA authorizes vaccinations ages, immunocompromised people still benefit around infected.

Delta plus mildly infectious. likely huge threat. blame bit. vaccine emergency room 3 times past 6 weeks cardiologist age 40. single health problem prior. People made aware potential severe side effects able make choice right them. 

Most people seem ignore fact vaccine prevent catching covid, prevent infecting others. merely supposed make symptoms less severe. literally reason force anyone want it. fever/chills/fatigue second shot.

IRS State say, it’s really worth it? maybe what’s left go towards long covid treatment bills… Even SNL joke mixing matching “winging it” phase pandemic. think could maybe make argument far countries mixed matched early on, research I’ve heard it’s actually good mix. (I’d assumed New Yorkers, [including one lost grandmother would bit loop research, apparently not.)  Uneducated people already say vaccines ineffective like preventing saying til lmao concern covid March 2020. Therefore booster might worth variants. Nice! Pfizer first 2 doses, recent data showing stay Pfizer, switch Moderna J&amp;J 3rd dose? Yeah. might hold longer I’m leaning towards early November feel comfortable upcoming holidays, biggest risk time. sums reasons quite nicely.  Two big things:

""On individual level, Dowdy told me, there’s probably minimal harm eligible people getting third shots now. ""

""I think it’s important say, get booster not?” Dowdy said, “but rather, Would prefer booster save opportunity later?”""

This tough decision, well written articles. two points make feel safer getting booster today (in 3 hours). travel 5 times next 5 months, at-risk trip 2 weeks now. think may well get boosters minimize bringing covid unvaccinated kids.

It sounds like concerns safety really.

Dr. Chatterjee said would voted differently F.D.A. asked authorizing vaccine adults 18 older.  basically told, ‘Here’s question, say yes no,’” said Dr. Chatterjee, pediatric infectious disease expert dean Chicago Medical School. “We also given opportunity explain vote.”  subsequent meetings, F.D.A. allowed science advisers request changes question explain votes. still restricted voting data included company’s application.  recent meeting, example, F.D.A. advisers said wanted recommend Johnson &amp; Johnson recipients option choose vaccine booster.

Nothing important.    also mutate time. still give birth humans. Crazy huh.

Anti-vaxxers made choice, might die result choice...but that’s invitation intentionally try kill them. put unvaccinated concentrated camps carry kind star find joy living together. “The rate positive COVID-19 test varies age vaccination status. rate positive COVID-19 test substantially lower vaccinated individuals compared unvaccinated individuals age 29. individuals aged greater 30, rate positive COVID-19 test higher vaccinated individuals compared unvaccinated. likely due variety reasons, including differences population vaccinated unvaccinated people well differences testing patterns.”

I would say it’s quirk data.

I would also say lots data sets show infection risks higher First, people see summaries studies don’t ever read part authors talk limitations study. 

Second, people ignore variables go viral transmission. Vaccinated people equally high viral load! Huzzah smoking gun! Actually no. viral load doesn’t stay high long unvaccinated. expose significant fewer people! course bunch variables. can’t look one assume anything. less % effectiveness ivermectin covid did! Body aches, sore arm general tiredness past 36 hours. Otherwise bad!   You: “There thousands idiots US.”

Me: “That’s it?” [third boosters extremely broad intentionally vague. health departments interpreting applying everyone (Colorado asking everyone get third dose). Others are, seemingly, denying exists all.  entire office, one managers fully vaccinated, majority even first jab. work panicking clients introducing restrictions fully vaccinated staff visit on-site.

Yes.  “If live life without sin, Jesus died nothing.” There's definitely shortage biopharma jobs pay pretty well (80-85k right undergrad, experience). think due insane amount VC money generating startups area support. 👋🏽 Remember world leaders; declare victory covid-19, can't reimpose lockdowns without either total fool Russia's case late, Covid Russia DLC [Third doses absurdly least didnt buy Pokemon Cards   run President!  


/s doesn't, though. read 6-8 times, thinking maybe missed something, there. clarify, response can't think single vaccine somehow super effective reducing illness take effect transmission, I'm historian vaccines maybe someone could educate me.

You HPV vaccines one think of, confers sterilizing immunity.

Which reading, unreasonably think, saying ""HPV vaccines super effective preventing illness, effect transmission, confer sterilizing immunity.""

If that's saying, please clarify. saying, please quote part linked page explains concept; maybe I'm idiot missed it. Basically ""shortage"" pay, one wants make minimum wage boss makes 300 times more. Lying buisnesses claiming shortage almost every whiney story Facebook offering hard labor dollars local McDonald's. Granted, usually twice minimum wage is, current price everything, minimum wages $50. Yes, every job adjusted accordingly, tired stupid people claiming they'd make nurses etc, nurses $100 etc, work there). Ya, seems high, minimum wages kept inflation, automatically adjusted year year based dollar.

Current system fucked lopsided people work, guess happens? stop working whole thing falls apart. We're really starting look like Ancient Rome. Happy Cake Day! millions workers would rather starve go back work inhumanely low wages. Let's focus them, anti-vaxxers deserve headline.  first read title thought meant scientists San Diego. them.....
This makes sense It’s probably regional. I’m Utah definitely labor shortage. Unemployment crazy low like 2%. 

Here due factors. First, lots tech jobs. also cheap labor tech. Cost living lower software engineers way cheaper. soon things went remote many people company offered way moved. lost 18/20 software engineers team. one better places work Utah. Higher wages, ESPP, RSU, 401k match, 100% paid healthcare, unlimited PTO, free food, healthy work environment, etc. couldn’t match places. 

Also, many people working services like restaurants laid early stages COVID went tech boot camps fill crazy need software engineers. 

Utah also lots farming seasonal employees ski resorts. pandemic started became impossible get work visas farming heavily relies visas well seasonal labor.

So yeah, crazy worker shortages here. conservatives talk. 95% fold like Guatemalian maid faced consequences. They're dirty cowards. 5% actually stand beliefs, even beliefs stupid. That's little admirable. Must nice retire perfect time.  No. argument it’s “only 40%” makes sense. Even studies finding waning don’t get there. 

I agree can’t go YOLO, also don’t need make false data claim. want learn circumvent paywall, see Or, website regularly read, think subscribing website. says studies needed newer technologies, chemical kill virus sprayed bottle onto surface it’s aerosol? virus stick particles, virus aerosol particles never meet? really, take decision need correct data. Even policy makers. 

You would behave differently risk 40% 99% like faulty data posted past, correct?  rather incomplete explanation flu shot, little bearing situation COVID shot. Hopefully become relevant. actually sound like much difference current churn rates. compare fact typically 1/3 new nurses leave workforce within first 2 years? provided source better, take much effort since work Fire fucks refuse get vaccinated. talking firing first responders? customer store ranting it, actually magnet nearby took keys showed keys aren’t magnetic, even vaccine even made magnetic, unbelievably dumb. I’ve thinking trying get vegetarian, carnivorous anagram coronavirus. Yeah true. think we're going experience lots unforseen consequences next year. seems silly think long. jobs freed intelligent people? Definitely seeing downside here. comment convinced bias could difference two comes covid infections. Thanks. ""forced vaccination"", still choice. Forced would holding vaccinating you. choose vaccinated unemployed. Yea it’s funny, literally people know haven’t got vax ones constantly talking it. 

Anyone else it’s “did get it?” “Yea” “nice too” carry like Normal people lol Yeah, that's vacation, PTO combined sick days vacation. So, something communicable? Either suck likely kiss trip planning year goodbye. Oh, emergency Covid sick leave option would cause ""financial hardship"" company.

Well 2 weeks entry level job. people making $50k, possibly 6 figures expect.

That's bad here. Turns we've taught, via corporate actions policies, staying home sick bad, people stay home sick. monday got full dose mix match 5 hhrs went gym fever went down, regrets.... mean voluntarily resigning. Ironic since first dose vectored better first dose mRNA.

But we're making [1.6 billion vaccine month. Manufacturing longer issue. Logistics, funding, uptake are. we're seeing three issues action. saw tabloid article Target words ""Why Covid shots work!"" front page, along ""These people took vaccine died!"" ""The disturbing truth breakthrough cases!"" ""Dr. Fauci caught lying immunity!""

I want live planet anymore. would think demoralizing permanent nurses stayed. whole situation doesn’t seem sustainable. Perhaps treat nurses better give bill rights like patients have.  Nice, job openings! understand you’re saying I’m disagreeing. wasn’t point. point general person street heard “vaccinated people spread covid” CDC took “the vaccines don’t stop spread”.   did.  side effects almost 34 hours now.  even sore arm.

Almost wondering got real thing. Haha. “In reports shared month, jail Superintendent Willie Scurry said jail offered COVID vaccine weeks ago, making available months. 12 incarcerated people chose get it.” [they   I'm assuming got half dose Moderna booster? 

Could please advise many hours vaccination begin see side effects? Thanks. labor shortage, usually goes, shit jobs get hit it. better jobs worry, people beating door get good jobs get shit jobs. many coming behind take bad jobs. got Covid month ago fully vaxxed, nobody house got it, fully vaxxed wife, fully vaxxed mom, neither young vax kids Zero chance figures accurate. Would nice target hit though…  What? really weird data argument. Proverbs 3:23-24 – go safely way, hurt foot \[while driving Mecedes\]. rather chuffed (pleased) 

Relevant [Aunty Donna  extra funny US viewers like use word ""chuffed"" here. chuffed explained meaning context said got new Thesaurus made pleased. Wage shortage Herd immunity Oops put 2 million Swiss account.

Don't worry delta, good employee, forget yay thousands job openings Unlikely story. Federal funds always properly allocated appropriate recipients. Also, God would never allow this. Let die compared entire population 160 million nothing. 0.1% estimated work force would 160,000. 
 
Perspective everything... problem headlines lack nuance. said 0.1% US workforce would rather lose jobs vaccinated. feel alarming, would it?  Get road. Fucking Morons Lol placard thumbnail says ""Vaccine"". Vaccines saved millions world nope suddenly conspiracy. well asked dentist recommended one, really good one

a hygenist said use alcohol ones too, mix match I’m hoping round comes delta back back HCAs South shithole states. *looks Arizona* Even 1% vast overexaggeration &amp;#x200B;

well least home get COVID

I always see positive things effective treatments always good thing, think generally speaking, vaccine almost always going better.

A therapeutic drug often heavy intervention, involving major biochemical effects unavoidable side effects. Vaccines, OTOH, train immune system recognize particular pathogen fight infection becomes serious. better prevents problem becoming serious (and damage body) first place, takes advantage tools body already minimum artificial intervention.

It's kind ironic, actually; woo-woo ""all-natural"" people terrified vaccines, many ways ""natural"" pharmaceutical product medical science created. February 2022: Winter Olympics China.

Oct/Nov 2022: 20th Chinese Communist Party Congress, Xi expected declare Chairman Life.

Btw, Pfizer first two shots. Cool restaurants hiring. Please everyone remember take vitamins mine work too. DOZENS US! Na na na na hey hey hey GOOD BYE! Hope enjoy new lifestyle change since likely taking pay cut Good. people complaining lazy people welfare find exactly hard get welfare. also get much better reception place keep keys, that’s nice. effective pfizer/moderna, definitely blunt effect outbreak probably cut transmission. Doesn’t mean wasn’t asymptomatic.  big money pet memorial stuff. nice wooden box, paw print plaster “personal” cremation almost $500 last year.  Fever, aches, chills pretty much gone 24 hours started! Soup, water, heating pad, lots sleep seem clear! Get BINAX antigen tests. super convenient easy use-results 15 minutes. Test day 7-8 exposure. wish people knew tests hahaha yeah &lt;1% Population really small sample size way reason panic care, aligns specific ideologies. Crazy regularly r-worded Reddit be. love  still answer!  Trick question! one involved Great Financial Crash 2008 went prison! estimate 4 100.

We hire every week.

This even blip. something immediately payable like good incentive. someone got vaccinated March/April, feels little unfair see incentives offered irresponsible time finally making right decision, people got $1,000 shot might change people’s minds, mention people already vaccinated pretend friends secretly got shot. something like $2,000, could really help working class people might otherwise gotten it, still pretend Facebook groups “never comply” finally get car fixed, home repair, etc. Correlation without causation gets thrown around way often.    Still sure even limited boosters all.    Yeah people frequently forget retirements deaths. That's huge number. shrink, shrink. blinkity-blink. tried make think. wanna go sink. vomit. clean wit' comet. earth planet.  Bye Felicia Dude looks like Dollar Store Creflo Dollar.

Good riddance. sexism  That’s good know. j&amp;j hit pretty good first time around. Guess I’ll wait til weekend get mRNA booster. Hope feel better soon!  Well, polio one. much transmission people.

But yes, vaccine gives lower vital load, would help. place society unconcerned others society. people willing endanger others selfishness. Society miss ""contribution"". think anyone claimed that

Aching 101 fever. Didn’t symptoms j&amp;j  Much better tactic would vaccinated, get COVID, join protest.

Cough lot. sure sing yell; really get spittle plume blowin'! tired headlines like this. That's small % even I'm guessing accurate. SERIOUSLY doubt many leaving jobs. group talk bite. Bye, Felicia help month meth pipe depends black white ones know personally covid already determined safest way deal this. They’d rather covid get shot. bet lot won’t even put fuss long. workplace heavy resistance vaccine know, got vaccinated. 

Even staunch conservative coworker claimed would go live grid get it! Move Russia u don’t like  didn’t figure would case, we’ll try another pharmacy 🤞   go jail. It’s choice, we’re forcing 🤷‍♂️  Jeez, that’s crazy. got third dose work situation CVS didn’t ask details all. hope find place give boosters. world needs compassion understanding. also needs media government that’s trustworthy. 

You show considerable lack compassion feel really bad you. Stop upset confused. It’s fault. 

Mandates right. Vaccines obviously help situation, appears virus isn’t going anywhere. 

Stop putting others happier. It’s worth it.   lot overdue retirements industry time. Lots guys early 60s got packaged 1000x many Delta cases Ay.4.2 week ago.    It’s part great resignation duh Janis Joplin! ☮️ gotten vaccinated. quite. understanding (not medical professional, curious googled) inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) keeps recipient getting *sick* catch polio, still transmit virus. they'd asymptomatic carrier.

The oral polio vaccine (OPV) prevents transmission, there's also risk vaccine recipient pass actual polio short time vaccination.

Unrelated, hope advances vaccines triggered pandemic eventually lead HIV vaccine too. CVS person completely full shit. long ago this? Selfish. change tune happens immediate family. hospital stays treat COVID unvaccinated adults.  takes methimazole clinic specialist endocrinologist private practice doesn’t offer shots anything.

As I’m vyvanse adhd type 2 narcolepsy clever people don’t know local restrictions are. I’m responsible them.

You asked end game told you.

You take information not. would isolate without testing positive? thought past isolating close contacts point. Fuck hope so. 8 applications ain't heard back yet. Give one privileged ass jobs  Even absurdly, Daszak key member WHO’s fact finding mission. closed ecosystem narrow research interests rife conflicts interest readily apparent casual observer and, worse yet, adequately disclosed public. investigation audit NIAID’s funding activities, carried external independent third party, would good place start. still hard unpack, seems primarily come 3 reasons little ""science"":

1) Vaccine equity. would literally issue press releases every time FDA CDC meeting boosters taking place demanding wealthy nations hold boosters people Africa poor areas got primary shots.

2) Fear approving boosters one vaccine (Pfizer) others would create confusion public.

3) Fear approving boosters early would increase vaccine hesitancy unvaccinated would cause assume need shots every 6 months forever. come? whom? didn’t get memo, figured I’d eat much possible supply chain snaps. Ok mention it. often wondered that. categorized Americans ""intense"" ""extreme"" maybe lack subtlety dissemination information. Sure, know plenty people around issue ""an American thing"" sure maybe prominence differs cultures.

We told shown (reference studies) government scientists beginning vaccination never 100% effective never 100% safe. course isn't. could be? That's reality works. made clear chances adverse effect getting Covid versus getting Vaccine maybe getting Covid (the chance happening already significantly diminished vaccine itself) different. yes, said long term effects vaccine unclear currently available data suggest significant difference vaccines.

At end day matter trust suppose since nobody really able verify claims. would need get degree least education virologist, pandemic specialist, medical doctor, lung specialist, immunologist several others check myself. matter far along knowledge track end day either trust trust someone.

However I'm sure would trust Fauci guy. seems severely impressed like spokesperson manager actual accomplished scientist specialist. that's impression.  know! I've following semi-closely. Maybe I'll ready date time come successful vaccine. 🙃 (I'm currently terrible health. pace work HIV vaccines treatments chronic fatigue syndrome similarly glacial, real possibility!)  There’s work. us hoping quit. rude generally less competent. Ironic statement considering actually people refusing vaccinated ones lacking compassion understanding  I’m public office city Manila true. Declining rates cause we’re almost 80% vaccinated lol, naturally rates decline majority vaccinated. Bye. What's everyone's favorite jab? I'm Moderna loyalist, friends Pfizer heads sure. Never met Johnson &amp; Johnson jabber. Pfizer Moderna known causing myocarditis pericarditis among young men. ( reason, Moderna vaccines currently suspended several countries. )

And mixing AZ Pfizer/Moderna proven generate robust immunization. Literally, yes. Go websites major hospitals near look careers site. hospitals post jobs anywhere except site. find union job take it, even mopping floors. Usually union rule job openings need filled internal candidates first. Six months mopping floors move IT, clerical, customer service, whatever qualified for. lot hospitals lot flexibility work-from-home used to, well. really went give liberty give death. reducing infections *does something transmissions*, that's exactly point u/BattleHall others making beginning. That's messaging problem entire discussion about.    Concentration.

Spray = visibly damp.  Fogging rarely used level.

Bit like flyspray. Direct shot it’ll die. Quickly fog room probably survives.  Empty 5 6 cans room, probably dies also trigger asthmatics kill fish. organizations individuals able get government assistance way don’t pay taxes?  AZ vaccines second administered COVID19 vaccines SK. ( also got AZ shot 1st dose. )

Besides, Pfizer Moderna vaccines useless unless donated countries proper transportation storage infastructures. There's also affordable childcare shortage, *safe* affordable childcare shortage. Suppose 2 paycheck household 1 paycheck going entirely childcare. Maybe math actually makes sense pre-pandemic-- need childcare *forever*, want partners stay workforce one partner big gap employment damages future career prospects. pandemic, though... lot people making choice stay home instead send kid overcrowded/undersupervised daycare they're gonna sneeze directly hands touch faces day.   ireland right seeing rise cases again. bothers 1 county Ireland, county Waterford, vaccine uptake 99.7% adults 18, yet also highest incident rate country. general high vaccination uptake. One highest Europe, case numbers worryly spiraling away western European countries apart UK. Fuck ‘em nurse thinks vaccines made magnetic. I’m personally fucking thrilled making jobs upcoming nurses actually want deserve. Well prepared lose life refusing vaccine, guess losing job trivial comparison. riled it? “Thousands workers across U.S fucking idiots” Well, they're making lives harder   used think show one politician willing tank his/her country's economy without publicly lynched? actively lie. Sure, things omitted like example vaccine supply acquired, terms contracts pharma companies similar stuff people would probably get upset since imagine well terms likely look like. nobody 100% honest obviously would outcast society. 0% 100% honesty. always two extremes. question whether upper third lower third range.  got COVID early realize it. Thought circulation issues. months later realized was. partner get sick thought it. months later getting X-rays back saw something unusual, something previous year... lung scarring. 

I wonder many people effects COVID19 without ever knowing it.  im still letting unvaccinated home regardless. need nurses believe science police put ego public safety. like group owls called parliament, group anti-vaxxers called rounding error.

This genuine question; I've seen articles mention similar side effects experienced adults: fever, chills, aches, etc. severe, bit stronger ""mild"". worst I've read myocarditis, seems rare. 


But missing something? safe, like safe gotten flu shot, Tdap, MMR, vaccine also Covid-19 vaccines.

I'm sure ""it's safe mix vaccines"" idea came from. We've mixing vaccines decades, often vaccines amplify effects others given together (MMR, Tdap). new vaccines nearly different people think.

We think like girl scout badges, blood types.  Well, transmitted covid exactly zero people thread full vaccinated people transmitted many people.   Go take cdc boss clearly need expert input  Well, transmitted covid exactly zero people thread full vaccinated people transmitted many people.

I two Pfizer vaccines sure whether get Pfizer Moderna booster.

But curious antibodies Pfizer antibodies?

I know generally antibodies spike protein, identical?

I thinking terms durability. getting higher amount initially ""nurturing"" ones already have, wonder losing longer term benefit.

I bad reaction second shot want maximize booster hoping last long time.

I wondering initial higher antibody count found Moderna following Pfizer like would get vaccine-naive first shot Moderna vs Pfizer.

The point assume increase neutralizing antibodies short term also increase b cells. know coding two vaccines same, know nurture entire long-term immune response. Thanks sharing experience! patiently wait turn hope best, sounding like good time. old job gave everyone $100 got vaccinated another $100 90% company did. current job seem care (both 100% remote though, really effect either way coworkers idiots) Hitting 6 months today. run get moderna booster asap wait?

1. people weak immune systems, especially older, still worry big way kick's flu's ass steals lunch money flu killed shit ton people year covid.  


2. choosing stay unvaccinated spread lot folks. family holidays Vaccinated people, Covid get chance test immunity anyway cause that's viruses do, mutate.  


Be safe encourage people vaccinated. health friends relatives health impossible replicate civilized places US, UK Germany, hardcore antivaccine % never relent, Portugal could definitely show us 'best case scenario' looks like compared pre-pandemic population outgoing medicine socialized. Essentially, making case numbers would countries ""teveryone vaccinated, people gather frequently big groups, enjoy summer outdoors go visit doctor"".  Sure, original comment included two links, one NYT article today, Atlantic. 

The NYT article talks number experts involved recommending boosters talk concern extent recommended. 

The Atlantic article month ago, posits majority people may benefits waiting boosters. Fed laws trump State laws. hospitals either comply face loss Fed dollars &amp; support. Easy choice. way. case  Ford describes approach loosening restrictions ""super cautious.""

For anyone Ontario, Ford giving real metrics determines caution would trigger loosening restrictions.

We provincial election June, lot decisions completely wipe away months development 'vaccine passports' whatnot coming across political posturing.

Our numbers good right time, life already virtually back normal besides masks private establishments needing show proof vaccination. Neither things impediment normal lives.  See?! proves something! 🤪 armchair theory (not scientist) get first vaccine dose new body body slowly develop antibodies fewer side effects.

At second dose, body ready mount immune response. unlike natural infection particles would enter nose body would start fight would delay virus starts replicating, mainlined spike protein portion virus engineered release quickly body immediate immune reaction. vaccine getting around lot regular immune defenses, like mucosa nose, example. vaccine going directly system designed proliferate create immune response.

Anything else seems like weird compromises would wanted widespread boosters want boosters (only 3rd shots immunocompromised people). 

To fair them, limited information boosters time (particularly terms double-blinded RCTs), instinct resist giving even emergency approval. prefer conservative approach approval time. 

My problem public messaging essentially ""booster work one needs boosters"" rather ""We received reviewed data made decision time cannot comment yet"" followed strong positive messaging following decisions. point, there's data showing something like 90-95% reduction death among 60+yos compared 2 shots (at least Pfizer), even without accounting reduction spread would caused widespread boosters.

Oh sure, vaccines far better unvaccinated. I’m anti-Pfizer anything, got Pfizer. daughter 3-years-old likely get Pfizer, first available. Unless specific contraindications, stance always best vaccine one syringe front you. 

We’re getting stage start understand best optimize vaccines. Maybe J&amp;J needs 2 dose series. Maybe mRNA vaccines need 3 dose series, maybe need longer dosing interval, like 12 weeks. Maybe Pfizer needs slightly higher dose, especially 65+ age group. Moderna saw higher rate myocarditis Pfizer young adults, maybe group needs lower dose. argument mandates strange me.

It’s two vaccines, read linked paper. something 0-10% better control 3 months vaccination, hardly qualifies “immensely.”

It pretty disheartening realize vaccinated Pfizer 6 months ago may little stop rest society catching passing disease. Especially I’m extremely low risk hospitalization/death based age, BMI, risk factors.  Well.. Okay, so… already delta… peaking something else going on? question UK. Alot people retired yet worth risk getting sick dealing much BS.

I also read article said ton families one parent quit stay home subtracting child care dealing school session made sense. two sets beliefs incompatible. They're complementary.  generally takes least 3 days show up. talking one specific vaccine, specific time vaccination. So; vaccination impact. worst case, it’s slightly better vaccinated, best case, it’s reducing spread great deal. give everyone perfect sterilizing immunity? No, it’s immensely better vaccinated. Saying something else giving antivaxx talking points. Yep! Friday talked woman thought end week she'd gone. mind something like government mind control. real wide eyed rambling rang beer. 

I know come to. people really dug try lash others even harming themselves. sad really.  Best tell, people quitting means promotion (and raises) thousands. seeing downside really. Ah, get problem is.

Okay happens this
* vaccine prevents 99.9% infections. (random number)
* 1 1000 person still get infected, transmit others normal though.

So summarize, transmissions 99.9% **but** still say ""it's effective transmissions"" simply anything them. 100% cases someone would able transmit vaccine, stilk can. frequency cases goes 99.9%, course reduces transmissions roughly amount.

This also absurdity anti-vax talk right now, even **if** current vaccines nothing transmissions, getting infected far less hence transmissions naturally down.

And yeah wording maybe confuse someone, scientific level makes sense word way.    surprised? saw they/we toilet paper beginning pandemic. (Not me. bought toilet paper ran out. Super awkward tho) Meh opportunities find something better. point diminishing returns, nature article points out. What’s point 3 months effectively nothing comparison Unfortunately, vaccine’s beneficial effect Delta transmission waned almost negligible levels time. people infected 2 weeks receiving vaccine developed University Oxford AstraZeneca, UK, chance unvaccinated close contact would test positive 57%, 3 months later, chance rose 67%. latter figure par likelihood unvaccinated person spread virus.” like financial analyst investment bank something Idiocracy Also law require A/C units saturate air it! Look job creators! Whats next? ""Vaccinated"" Mexican took job?  jobs fresh graduates! matter. ask can't anyway beyond something makes part high risk group. go specifics. wrong however saying ""To little late"" exists reason. 

It's easy stop spread numbers low, things like contact tracing possible. specific positivity rates testing becomes less useful. 

So stuff like vaccine passports masking done later on, yes make difference.

However testing takes long results, contact tracing harder many individuals many contacts, dynamics close contact means masking masking etc etc etc.

Yes would effective still, policies 10x effective lower case numbers higher case numbers, positivity testing increases problem compounds. mention peoples psychology, getting test back 12 hour vs 72 hours, people tell people got test, people tell people got positive result. longer individual etc etc etc. “But look statistics. 99% people didn’t get fired. making big deal less 1% termination rate?” 

- someone another sub I’ll borrowing  Vaccines reduce transmission. stop completely, much better nothing. vaccinate, lower R get. start next cycle. Well, almost delta thanks India less. Statistics

Not make errors millions dollars, different department expects tell range possible errors hedge it. Well honestly, degree agree, ""I explain can't understand you"" still applies.

Absolutely basic principles immune system works, vaccines work mathematical level less infections naturally reduce transmissions even minor reductions infections lead entire ""safe"" spots population... I'm sorry, even really need real education that, much intuitive earliest grade math.

Delta, almost large scale population studies show effects vaccination populations dissipate extremely rapidly months after.

As far know, *two* studies looking directly Delta transmission. UK Dutch suggest reduced onward transmission vaccinated indexes.

There plenty data/studies suggesting quicker viral clearance, shorter infectious window, lower/less infectious shed virus cases breakthrough, Transmission appears (relatively) inefficient. also concern testing PCR (as studies do) overestimates It’s pretty established Ct count proven good corollary viral load/infectiousness, it’s probably measure viral material nasopharynx. analyses large ongoing/realtime UK REACT-1 analysis also found lower viral load(and reduced infections, decent VE) average among vaccinated persons. says sampled population random included person tested positive, makes sense.

You must also consider vaccination works prevent infection first place. alone effect reducing ""Unfortunately, vaccine’s beneficial effect Delta transmission waned almost negligible levels time. people infected 2 weeks receiving vaccine developed University Oxford AstraZeneca, UK, chance unvaccinated close contact would test positive 57%, 3 months later, chance rose 67%. latter figure par likelihood unvaccinated person spread virus.""

This AZ unfortunately appears less effective, especially protection infection. It’s hypothesised UK’s reliance AZ large part population partially responsible high transmission. 

It’s unexpected though, vaccinated breakthrough cases, waning VE, transmissible, transmissible unvaccinated indexes, eventually.

There also confounders unvaccinated continuing gain infection immunity, hence keep using methodology, technically continue appear decline towards zero, even there’s little/no actual decline(which especially significant country like UK). Eyre et al. mentions limitation. also mention limitations methodology may underestimate transmission.

Again, also consider fact vaccination works prevent infection first place—as studies UK Covid surveillance last 6+ weeks shown many age groups, double vaccinated crowd higher infection rate per 100k people unvaccinated (page 13):

This true recently popular myth. Putting aside fact raw data adjustment confounders whatsoever, interpreted face value(as document cautions against); don’t know number people unvaccinated group(the denominator) using population estimates. use NIMS data(which lot, reasons preferred used NHS); use ONS data(also accurate, better available data), paints different picture, favouring vaccinated group, unvaccinated group showing double infection rates. See shows this. Short explaining same. Neither accurate, obviously, reason caveat denominator document.

Hence raw data relies knowing number people unvaccinated group unreliable—not reading raw data anyways, mentioned above...That’s warn misinterpretation raw data, point available data(studies, real-world studies/analyses, raw data) shows good infection(even 6 months 2nd dose, although wane protection). recent REACT-1 analysis PR didn’t look bad either. reason people decide read raw surveillance data massive REACT-1 Let's honest open discussion vaccine efficacy comes transmission. evidence shows cuts hospitalizations deaths 50-90%, really support reduction transmission.

It appears data support non-trivial reduction transmission. feel like less vaccine federal mandate.... mean got vax refuse shop anywhere request proof.  Navy personnel Sailors last checked...  First that's taxes that's funding unemployment fund. second using it.  think go away? highly effective vaccine widely available we’re still wearing them. What’s going change “some day”? Masks stay agree guy, they’re fucking stupid Bye Felicia  WH walked talk agency independence instead thinking ok “it’s us them” Trump’s fault politicizing pandemic. sad fuck likes divide people churn anger.

I followed closely seemed politicized sides time. Dems criticized actions/non-actions Reps made errors admit it. pandemic political issue every country course is. try change behavior people, necessary pandemic, need use existing structures within country. even matter appeal citizens actually mandate behavior. communicating coherent message people best act must centralized effort costs manpower money. turn payed taxes. nature event like political. Unless misunderstand mean ""politicizing "". Hunger cures anti-vaxxers too, takes 2 weeks. ...not antivaxxers  kinda expected, vaccines greatly reduce hospitalization yet supposed se substantial number cases, even reduce social restrictions.  Thousands? 10s thousands, 100s thousands, millions? 

Why care this? care Petito missing [missing indigenous majority people US favor form universal health care regulation climate change, better wages rights employees, Morons all. people goddamned dumb? registration system allows local vaccination centers order exact amount doses based appointments? Sure, people turn inevitable minor loss. based number appointments made calculate trend order vaccine regular basis manufacturer ahead time order minimize loss. So..... tiny percentage then. Seems similar glad multiple groups working vaccine, BioNTech's melanoma mARN vaccine future seems bright. hope we'll able stop lot diseases soon. Oh sorry, yes meant that. Sorry clear, English primary language. watched WW2 documentary, nothing quite like comparing old USA new USA. Big yikes. think vaccine much shouldn’t working kind public service anyway Great benefits, high pay, training - expect know specific technology kind experience development needed. everyone mind code. wants pandemic end. followed guidelines getting tired hearing ""just two week quarantine"" ""just another month"" ""vaccines end this"" almost two years now.

Hmm, difference communication seems. pandemic every year. flu pandemic. usually rise threshold required declared pandemic (usually around January).

Now, government thinks, based data available them, Covid might well go direction might never go away completely. goal initially prevent pandemic dream shattered within days. Since made clear goal endure pandemic acceptable amount deaths. main goal make sure health system collapse consequences people require it. Death inevitable event lucky Covid tame is. Sure, Covid would better could much worse well.

In Europe maybe least strict mandates rules. Individual freedom rule law important prevention bodily harm. vaccination levels therefore lower countries bludgeon citizens. pay freedom dead people. However, vast majority unvaccinated people choice. think flip side UK strategy vaccine mitigations. proven successful strategy, even extremely high vaccine rates they're seeing surge cases. contrast, Asia sustained success thre prong strategy contact tracing, masking, vaccines.

My point multiple studies starting show efficacy vaccines transmission waning significantly. That’s really it’s getting at. fact you’re vaccinated it’s probably care others think covid real. You’re far likely get tested symptoms. Essentially there’s many variables compare two data points. It’s like States saying X state covid cases state excluding fact X state double testing rate.

Personally (37F) got J&amp;J back March getting Moderna Saturday (first appointment could get require missing work side effects next day). gotten mRNA might wait another couple weeks maximum protection going Thanksgiving Christmas since want see family dad one anti-vax types. also think next couple weeks might sweet spot avoiding scheduling hassles - supply chain issues know happen children get approved. kind depends relative risk level - overweight? work public? children elderly family members? That's guidance unclear, complicated situation without single answer people. They're terrible useful Next up, ""Antibiotics spread bacteria!"" likely alone.

That would seem unfair. person #1 truly friend, would stay :) same. experience side effects booster?  

What reasoning going Moderna booster half dose vs Pfizer full dose?

The fact Pfizer Moderna full dose close immune response, seems imply half dose Moderna might inferior FULL dose Pfizer.  PCR tests extremely accurate, trust 🙂 websites, least US, track rate transmission state (to best ability). agreement much US trending lower past several weeks. includes places without mask mandates.

Masks work, know that, helped states Delta burned them. came great cost (and still huge problem) are.  Absolutely incorrect least terms age anti vaxers. Boomers generation vaccine hesitant. currently recommending people get vaccinated health *others*. never viewpoint far pandemic, think changed.

Before get booster health others based government ""recommendations"", expect governments overall vastly better risk-benefit thing give unvaccinated first dose. ""Fulfill societal obligations"" - might actual argument vaccines actually greatly reduced transmission providing sterilizing immunity.

Honestly, terribly lazy argument.

J&amp;J, need wait 2 months. wait times irrespective booster decide get. Ok. It’s seen stuff like get like 1 month like 3 months 2nd dose. Thanks replying. 6 Months fine.

Before booster, PFizer, J&amp;J Moderna? He's perfect novel scenario. impossible be. follow closely realize far right wrong, far accurate experts. Yup, that's FDA position, appropriate one would number hospitalised much higher number got severely moderately ill?

(the paper specifies 2.2% figure covers moderate severe) 6 months optimal. doubt anyone stop getting earlier, primary reason need booster enough time two original doses. Thank you! Yeah, ""exceptional risk"" mentioned... case completely agree extra careful 🙂 applies everyone regardless vaccination “large gatherings” that’s specific gets. result, people wear masks outdoors everywhere. I’m getting lots mixed answers google. 

So already 2nd dose Pfizer back May. means wait 6 months—November— get booster shot right? Lmafooo asked pediatrician 2 year old. said 2022. disappointed Would interesting see states, surprise close deaths births. know response NEVER linear dosage.

For ex 100 mcg Moderna 3.33x Pfizer 30 mcg.

What surprises FDA recommended HALF dose Moderna STUDIES boosters FULL dose.

That seems like strange decision. Reverse scenario it’s anti-vaxxer intentionally running healthcare worker. average dedicated anti-vaxxer seems think vaccines deadly, mind decision making process run someone prevent would make sense.

Have think new scenario makes feel, you’ll answer. 
I   may ""necessary"" individual health reasons, absolutely recommended help bring community spread R0 less 1.

I think misunderstanding regarding R0. possible get R0&lt;1 country level, groups (actually changing set groups) thus persistent spread within community, giving correct set conditions generate wave country level. 

The reason due heterogeneous mixing society, idiosyncrasy within groups, different changing exposure levels, incoming travelers, waning immunity, weather, etc. Society complex represented single number. like vaccines working. county 99.9% 1st dose vax rate among eligible. SARS-CoV-2 respiratory virus spreads air.

Will interesting see comparisons 3rd dose coming months. Maybe differences 3x Pfizer vs 3x Moderna nearly big initial 2 doses. Grew small town Ohio. Moved Columbus. lot friends high school. think it’s people getting podunk moving places state outsiders coming state. anti-vaxxers using breakthrough infection evidence vaccines don’t work all. they’ve got someone administration long past making claim vaccine would prevent infection. keep trotting out, saying we’re changing goal posts. It’s pretty ridiculous, are.

Don't see? fact everyone downvoting proves I'm right! kind answered question way, perfectly healthy people (especially lower age groups) low risk becoming severely ill vast majority cases able go infection without serious complications. yes, depending health status running *a* risk taking vaccine, risk adverse reactions taking vaccine well, running risk either way.

For children, benefit clear enough justify mandate especially something like myocarditis (which anything mild) table potential side effect, societal benefit sterilizing immunity dream long gone.

I decided get vaccine kids yet would like wait hear preponderance *world's* scientists, know would support mandate (independent decision vaccinate not). self awareness whatsoever... point, anyone surprised stuff coming Florida?  ....

Flu vaccines one worst effective vaccines there.  Guarantee less people would gotten it. Got Moderna (half size) booster Friday, 7 months since one shot J&amp;J.

Can't sleep arm, otherwise issues report. wonder 7 months, prior J&amp;J remnants respond follow-up booster Moderna? don’t really think mandate nothing vaccine  living Singapore trying guarantee they'll like many people know multiple forms welfare bitching people welfare lazy good nothings. 

And point they're also welfare, million reasons okay. Yup. used make lot money consulting banks, constantly felt violated oppressive suit-wearing policies. felt like woman held captive ISIS. Sounds like another story sow distrust government.

It would best interest come clean, specifically Dr. Fauci seems connect NIH. I'm getting point care anymore. I've vaccinated, soon let 12s get child vaccinated. Everyone (well, family wise) we're around vaccinated. 

Like, go ahead, quit job whine. screaming other, majority us vaccinated take minimal precautions really care. Get sick beg money GoFundMe, go ahead. getting ""well sucks"" shrug me.

I've gotten point someone starts harping go ""okay"" keep I'm doing. We're point people made minds land topic, nothing change it.

Broad question - better wait Pfizer manufacturers' later boosters developed specifically Delta? appointment get booster, wondering wait. Pfizer availability   Yes. Smoking listed underlying condition, work medicinal cannabis facility. produce fairly large amount year. Can't exact numbers contract reasons, tonnes/year range.

There's big new facility slated open Queensland capacity five hundred tonnes product year. entire yearly production within legal margin error. insane. Good. don’t care anymore.

[Vaccinated People Breakthrough Infections Spread Delta Variant, CDC 
All remember seeing interview statement supported idea vaccinated people could still spread disease (which true) thus masks still needed. degree vaccines *reduce* spread unknown data started coming (and continues so). 

This certainly confusing variety factors, including viral loads measured, CDC report data has. would've entirely counter-productive say, ""vaccines stop transmission"" clearly known untrue beginning.

The zoo said animal care staff adheres strict COVID-19 protocols around animals, including required use personal protective equipment, hygiene, cleaning, employee self-screening, health management.

The UK definitely better sequencing program, US's good enough we'd notice spreading lot already wrong, would wrong sympathy antivaxxers get hit attacks like this? successfully fought virus yet, hospitals still getting overrun waves still sucked critical funds lack predictable medical treatment that's non-covid related. there's lack supplies various reasons, including covid related issues, replacing people fast possible. course problems, covid definitely major part it. no, shown navigate living virus yet, sure surely state can. evidence yet.

One look trump really tell that. tricky thing monoclonals effective early stages illness, means narrow window administered. they're expensive hell.    agree you. 100% think need dosing interval adjustment, hoped would see vaccine available kids. absolutely building ship we’re sailing it! 

I listened TWiV lately said highest number CD8 cells actually seen J&amp;J recipients, almost 10-fold higher, Pfizer Moderna we’re same; thought interesting. 

But, looking real world data, amongst vaccinated people, compared Moderna saw Pfizer hospitalizations Pfizer deaths Delta wave, yet J&amp;J highest. Moderna best preforming vaccine bunch, dosing interval almost Pfizer Moderna (Walgreens, example, scheduling everyone 4 weeks apart), wonder dose itself. Maybe Pfizer’s dose higher. Tbh unique conservatives. generally everyone behaves. that's problem comes Covid.

(Nasdaq: MRNA), biotechnology company pioneering messenger RNA (mRNA) therapeutics vaccines, today announced positive interim data Phase 2/3 study, called KidCOVE study, mRNA-1273, Company’s vaccine candidate COVID-19, children 6 12 years age. interim analysis showed robust neutralizing antibody response two doses mRNA-1273 50 µg dose level favorable safety profile. Moderna plans submit data U.S. Food Drug Administration (FDA), European Medicines Agency (EMA) global regulators near term. 
 
“We encouraged immunogenicity safety profile mRNA-1273 children aged 6 12 years pleased study met primary immunogenicity endpoints,” said Stéphane Bancel, Chief Executive Officer Moderna. “We look forward filing regulators globally remain committed part help end COVID-19 pandemic vaccine adults children ages.” 
 
KidCOVE randomized, observer-blind, placebo-controlled expansion study evaluate safety, tolerability, reactogenicity effectiveness two 50 µg doses mRNA-1273 given healthy children 28 days apart. study population divided 3 age groups (6 &lt;12 years, 2 &lt;6 years, 6 months &lt;2 years). Today Moderna reports 6 12 years age cohort. 
 
This cohort enrolled 4,753 participants 6 less 12 years age. trial, SARS-Cov-2-neutralizing antibody geometric mean ratio (GMR) comparing response children response young adults Phase 3 COVE study 1.5 (95% Cl: 1.3, 1.8), seroresponse rate 99.3%, representing difference 0.6% (95% CI: -2.8%, 2.8%) Phase 3 benchmark. results demonstrate strong immune response cohort children one month second dose met co-primary immunogenicity endpoints 6 less 12 years olds KidCOVE.

I say now. fully vaccinated due fact moron.

If US vaccinated; problem, mine. exactly prescribed keep safe pre-vaccine. soon vax available, vaccinated protect others.

If refusing vaccinated care you... even little Pretty sure CNN's viewer base fallen 50% since Biden president Fox increased  Lmfao planet take “a months” determine immunocompromised comorbidity covid? That’s immediately obvious anyone understands immunocompromised means.   wanted honest, would pointed really need get data many *vaccinated* people get infected vaccinated people test positive. reports date suggest risk infection vaccinated person 5-8x less. ~25x less chance hospitalization. 

What blurb posted suggest? you’re unvaccinated get infected much easily. get vaccinated. 

Not you’re trying imply. exact scenario happened best friend SO. convinced also covid despite symptoms since together maskless sleeping bed. got tested 6 times (3 rapid, 3 regular) next 2 weeks negative entire time. also mild symptoms.  fox network vaccine mandate yet hosts keep pedling antivax misinformation. hosts dont point lack integrity wouldnt working fox any.

But rest world obligated adjust decision Sounds like shit jobs elevate order survive. know, like pay people fair compensation time hire enough people work-life balance. waste perfectly good day sick? /s  How’s work-life balance? benefits like? pay comparable competition? offer training? What’s company’s reputation? 

Honestly, it’s real “we’ve tried nothing we’re ideas” moment folks who’ve exploiting work order stay afloat, also goes Fortune 500. don’t unskilled criminally undervalued. got Pfizer booster today. started feeling tired feverish couple hours third shot. First shot, sore arm next day. Second shot, feel much next day either, got fever muscle aches. Compared first two, third shot kicked super quickly. like trash taking outside  fanfic voluntarily unemployed  hardly matters. definitely safe (except rare allergy issue mentioned elsewhere, main allergen PEG both). Arguably smaller (30 mcg) pfizer dose better younger people anyone who's paranoid side effects, larger (50 mcg) moderna booster even moderna original (100 mcg) better older people.  *crickets* much company pay relation competition? management bad rep? benefits work-life balance worth compared hours commute? 

It doesn’t “look noble.” can’t survive without exploiting people, that’s you, answer blame people wanting work shitty conditions rather fixing conditions you’d rather pay less would take pay childcare necessary work there, can’t act shocked people don’t go it.

Who fuck cares. Yes working position school makes eligible. Whether teacher, cafeteria worker, work department, increased risk exposure.

Details would nice.   *they've made choice take part deaths many people selfishness ignorance, many people make choice already died it. antivaxxers risk due actions, hated rest. They'd go back goofy curiosity laughed occasion, like pre-covid.

But right, still ok. meant... let's real what's going on. innocent victims less harmful happened them. personal opinion even people cause major problems like antivaxxers done deserve live, deserve treated dignity they're better educated. one asked born, lived whole different life separate mine led way thinking. try use compassion much berating them. shared water bottle close friend concert tested positive Covid 4 days later. Day concert, began exhibiting symptoms. us fully vaccinated. She’s cancer survivor think maybe immune system isn’t great? Regardless, NEVER got def felt like awful cold, strictly cold. Vaccines save lives! Spoiler Alert: lose Jobs Sounds bit like many peoples #2 Moderna. “The shitty feeling means it’s working”. wish real summer 2021 messaging could’ve been, everyone wear mask don’t know lying vaccination status. commenter, got Moderna booster yesterday afternoon. Didn’t feel anything around 15 hours later. Still feel bit achy slight chills. second dose, fever got almost 103. time never surpassed 100.  millions?  said turnover high. sound like great company. Good guy sk haven’t heard much boosters targeted toward delta. absolutely better get booster now, waning efficacy shots received 6 months ago. vaccines available still work delta, wouldn’t wise essentially unprotected heading winter different shot likely many months away, comes all.  Yes half dose Moderna booster. received shot 1pm, fine rest day 9pm, arm started get sore, took couple Advils. next morning, felt exhausted body aches, wasn’t severe, kept Advil chilled day. 

I’d recommend much shot, plan time. Nope, I’ve got great job popular company treats us well. Actually took solid promotion within past 2 months. applicants know (as companies obviously days people getting back work early covid days), there’s reason arbitrarily keep increasing everyone’s pay someone left company. knowledge, aren’t many companies/industries that. 

We’re hyper-growth mode right now, workforce isn’t dwindling, rather it’s booming, concept giving someone raise simply someone else left isn’t realistic all. imagine maybe work tiny company employee essentially irreplaceable short notice? obviously would make sense large company keep infinitely throwing raises people naturally come go. 

I know people work healthcare, military, public accounting, marketing, recruiting, consulting, construction, power manufacturing, trades, animal hospitals, plenty fields fast food, none get raises due coworkers moving on. That’s standard practice you’re trying make be. still haven’t answered initial question, would make make sense. someone caught covid 4 months receiving J&amp;J, I’m personally opting Pfizer booster due data showing protection lasts far longer much stronger getting second dose J&amp;J. considering thousands workers health critical fields, I'm willing let them. people wear seatbelts sometimes still die car crashes, people don’t smoke sometimes still get lung cancer. It’s risk reduction. actually idiot, disingenuous?  America world renowned fucking stupid people. think there’s supply now. I’m well-vaccinated region top 10 vaccinated states (NJ), able immediately find booster appointment nearest Walgreens. “The single greatest cause atheism today Christians. acknowledge Jesus lips. walk door, get lifestyle. unbelieving world. Simply finds, unbelievable.” thousands day. people can't bothered what's right one another.  deal here, getting booster hour. Also covid couple months ago, hopefully don’t ever catch now. shit sucked bad. uk peeps dont give fuck virus think government manipulating covid stats... shit shit? vaccine mandate hugely successful forcing hesitant people get safe, effective vaccine every news source highlighting fucking Jimbo accounting mainlines OAN thinks government gives shit enough bother tracking arm instead using convenient tracking device carries khakis. Zero sympathy. right get vaccine. employer right fire them. Let vaccinated people take jobs. Ugh using vaccine excuse 2 days work. True, expecting new research since title kinda implied this. existing data/analyses replied previously someone plenty data/studies suggesting quicker viral clearance, shorter infectious window, lower/less infectious shed virus cases Transmission appears (relatively) inefficient. also concern testing PCR (as studies do) overestimates It’s pretty established Ct count proven good corollary viral load/infectiousness, it’s probably measure viral material nasopharynx. analyses large ongoing/realtime UK REACT-1 analysis also found lower viral load(and reduced infections, decent VE) average among vaccinated persons. says sampled population random included person tested positive, makes far know, two studies looking directly Delta transmission, uploaded recently preprint server. UK Dutch suggest reduced onward transmission vaccinated must also consider fact vaccination works prevent infection first place—as studies mention. alone effect reducing also confounders unvaccinated continuing gain infection immunity, hence keep using methodology, technically continue appear decline towards zero, even there’s little/no actual decline(which especially significant country like UK). Eyre et al. mentions limitation study. also mention limitations methodology may underestimate Overall appears data support non-trivial reduction transmission. first Pfizer shot, side effects, second shot, arm sore felt exhausted 24 hours.  follow rules too, unemployment fired fault own.

they qualify.   ""Attack rate""?

Gee let's tone drama. It’s probably two overlapping circles ah yeahhhh, go South Korea go! many people rabidly admitting masks uncomfortable? They’re temporary measure significantly impacts life. people (especially fully vaxxed) get dog piled wanting removal metric/complaining they’re vaccinated still wear them?

This isn’t want live life. Good you! happening since churches churches. Tell friends lol. Flying Spaghetti Monster accepts you. I'm somewhat engineer myself. Going side effects Moderna booster right now. Way manageable came J&amp;J shot. Biggest downside side effects started night top usual also get sleep deprived. guess it’ll clear tomorrow. symptoms? It’s probably best see doctor least start calling nurse hotline access that! silver linings COVID going become clear next 5-10 years. Vaccine tech research gotten veritable steroid injection thanks pandemic, payoffs immense. That's pretty bad analogy, since one die all. presented option 2 1000 people, choosing 1000 people acting like spoiled brat can't bothered. second sentence, one said 2 unvaccinated people leads death thousands. bunch unvaccinated people leads many additional deaths, deaths piled pretty high.

The difference one things personal violent, impersonal nonviolent. see death deaths they're responsible for, feel like aren't. they're still responsible, accountable. Nah, he's probably going go jail. He's Black, means cloak invulnerability prosecution offered white folk available him. nurse talking right?

Every hospital clinic ""blitz days"" would staff house entire shifts distribute vaccine. lady nurse, everything power avoid point. Interestingly, hear otherwise pro-vaccine ""pro-science"" people, usually along lines ""it's perfect need measures"" without acknowledgement much effective vaccines stemming transmission NPI.  “…some people much need them.” 

TWIV gone multiple times panel many great points boosters really needed. Please keep mind perhaps listen scientists politicians.  evidence that. Sure, anti-vaxxers famously known people afford work. ^/s Ah, confusing two different concepts. Ooooooh. Let correct this. Same. Mother get booster soon 6 months second shot, dad need work get there. cares? Stop putting spotlight people helping spread agenda. latest Pfizer/BioNTech study used 7 days post booster start collecting data continued study 2.5 months.

2 weeks never time ""full effectiveness"" original series, number made make easy remember definition ""fully vaccinated"". Pfizer actually study starting 1 week 2nd shot Moderna starting 2 weeks. Subsequent studies showed immunity continuing increase around 2 months started decline slightly.

Bottom line got original shots 6 months ago got booster now, fine, need wait 2 weeks anything.    I’m sure least people got this. Finally someone “news” station spoke Thousands workers across US would rather long term job short term vaccine may may “save” virus may may get turn, may may kill them. 

I agree workers. “Get temporary immunity give right provide family!!!” Behold power propaganda.   live right nearby stadium idiots parading streets harassing people, area specifically tailored families young kids. many made known. Don’t let door hit ‘em ass way out. So, you’re upset can’t get children work shitty wage? Interesting. could also see evidence $15/hour job isn’t worth many people. He’s susceptible breakthrough case threatens personally.

That seems trend though. people care affects personally.  Oh well. Sucks them. Lots people replace though.... Okay, bye bye, missed easily replaced  US UK bending backwards limit supply vaccine easily despicable thing I've ever witnessed lifetime. 

Capitalism corrupts absolutely. hate say people refusing get vaccine work subset anti-work movement. Even though putting co workers risk closely linked demands bosses railing against. 

I'm saying I'm them, moment clarity toilet, get it.  anything negative happen you’re vaccinated sooner? guaranteed protection much sooner. Everything I’m reading online says get ASAP. I’m taking chances new variants, especially since received J&amp;J. gotta token dissent, say fair balanced.  Everyone opinions vaccines, y'all crazy think justifiable get fired want something government forcing do.  evidently seen William Friedkin documentary Exorcist. I’d like see medical community comment someone recent breakthrough case get booster.  2 thumbs care less?

Im sure in-between due extremely high viral load produced Delta, appears Delta VOC even transmissible, likely even higher viral load produced Delta original - unless aware mechanical biological mechanism virus destroyed expelled infects human, I'm aware methods, perhaps heard manner convince force vaccine uptake still unwilling and/or unable. opportunity in-between spread slower Delta exist, know highly contagious, days ago study released Navy ship 100% sequenced Delta Variant Concern, spread infect 90% entire ship 25 days. might think, well, that's ship, correct, ship, winter coming, mass adapted hvac systems scrub air viral particles, going little wood brick ships packed humans, aka homes offices, months.
