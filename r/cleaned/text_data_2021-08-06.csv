0,2021-08-06," second case I've read TODAY people ICU thinking they're immune covid already it. one good friends getting vaccine already covid despite pleas. cut I'm Canada. Getting fully vaccinated next week. major issue nothing approval. It'll genuinely held religious beliefs. 

It's illegal employer fire someone one. Kinda crap Kentucky residents infected SARS-CoV-2 2020, vaccination status reinfected May‚ÄìJune 2021 compared residents reinfected. case-control study, unvaccinated associated 2.34 times odds reinfection compared fully vaccinated.

It‚Äôs comparing people got covid 1+ year ago people got vaccine within last 6 months. don‚Äôt event think vaccine last 1+ years without booster THIS! know entirely accurate

Are numbers somewhere? I've never seen specific numbers, source, I'd curious see it. take cookie

If old enough, get vaccinated.


It's safe effective. Every past present U.S. president vaccinated, even one got Covid claiming immunity got vaccinated vaccines came out. cant find enough workers is, arent going shrink potential labor pool deal turnover refuse get it. dont care health employees, care people sick close contacts. Mainline ramp live starts 18 goes 30. Got shower yesterday started feeling nauseous. headache mild fever woke couple times night chills sweating. Woke morning right eye sore whenever look around eye moving head. Also sneezing there. Double vaxxed moderna 2 months since last dose. Gonna get tested tomorrow. Thoughts? covid Still, priors new variant behaves *mostly* way older variants. None new variants date major deviations previous ones. 

(Of course, one exception probably changes reproduction rates, much else) Airlines notoriously low paid. Flight attendants regional airlines paid poor. 

Everyone else ranges meh ~500k+. Delta Captain recently made million A350. article didn‚Äôt say though completely inevitable. friend teaches high school outbreak first week in-person school back May.

Maybe he'll hundred dollars. Nothing like crowding unvaccinated people hurricane shelter insure they're exposed pandemic disease. Nope yet. Got first dose April second beginning May. missed 2 cycles far. That's they'll start lying vaccination status. they'll still refuse get vaccinated. think I'll take sore forearm potentially dying, suffering long COVID getting bad flu. hey, you. don‚Äôt die. certain amount hours paid shot, depended aircraft flew long w/ company...some got 8k

My American Airlines pilot relative got $4,500 Basically cold adults cold babies, rarely sometimes worse babies. Something tells probably never South, India, _definitely_ both.  Previously infected people least get one vaccine dose. Lab studies show provide great boost immunity.

That's pretty good considering big majority people think virus fuckn hoax. figure they're reporting original post efficacy hospitalization. That's typically higher efficacy symptomatic infection. seen report yet J&amp;J symptomatic Delta infection. Studies seem slower since lot fewer people got J&amp;J vaccine mRNA vaccines.  Anyone not? That‚Äôs kept thinking reading article. huge opportunity there! so, going see EVERY concert closed unvaccinated. 

Lollapalooza even keep unvaccinated long could show negative test. insist them, hope future outdoor concerts insist vaccines going forward. Wtf wow Oh fine. one likes idea lockdown. personally despise it. problem graphs becoming exponential. trend continues going cripple healthcare going refrigerated morgue trucks again. seems much easier quicker admit take necessary steps now. oblivious dichotomy exists political theater. don‚Äôt kid chances national lockdown organized enacted 50 states once. don‚Äôt think Biden declare martial law make states comply. wouldn‚Äôt want try. saying national 2 week lockdown would put us much better place regards spreading wave 4. Nothing beats transmission virus like isolation. understand improbability happening. side note want say aggressive posture insults help foster good faith debate. Ya, one time went without mask, got covid. Took week family, nearly us vaccinated. others one dose help them, getting 2nd dose tomorrow I‚Äôm terrified. Fuck state. Hah. Gotta keep em separated! nookie

And stick (yeah)
Stick (yeah)
Stick (yeah) Floridians short memory.. 2024 far away plenty time people forget Governor literally actively letting people die.  Thank you! arm killing haha. Appreciate you, stranger. Let‚Äôs put way. possible? Theoretically. Covid likely trigger autoimmune illness vaccines are? Absolutely. Many, many people end battling autoimmune diseases trace trigger back viral infection. It‚Äôs well known issue.

Anyone using argument won‚Äôt get vaccine anti vaxxer.  Long lasting effects children happen question whether happen less frequently (rare) serious side effects vaccines.

Corrected correction. surprised everyone learn they're actually #26 deaths per capita? understand conservative point view opposition mandatory mask law federal even state wide level, seriously get banning local governments deciding best municipality even private business mask mandate. That‚Äôs many got hydrocychloroquine. Pet stores fish tanks. I‚Äôll admit bought antibiotics pets didn‚Äôt insurance, antibiotic I‚Äôd taken past got strength. I‚Äôm stupid enough try something I‚Äôve never heard touted quack doctor believes alien DNA DJT. first 5 days, starts diverge Theoretically yes (or negative test) anecdotally sounds like document-checking process wasn‚Äôt stringent given crowds. I'd argue Texas barely part American union. eye surgeons extremely knowledgeable eye years practice tends make unwilling admit know something love image uneven tan makeup open gap mouth. see people who've demonstrated bad decision making refusing vaccines driving. appreciate love care child. wish best children.

But evaluate risk objectively. death children extremely low. They're far likely die accident (the leading cause death children). fact, they're much likely get murdered die covid.

About 2500 kids murdered 2017. ten times likely death total expected year. 

Perspective important. want child end statistic I'm there. Still, decisions driven evidence emotion.

That's decry decisions anti-maskers anti-vaxxers. Let's commit sin. close, regardless, children would never morbidly obese like this.  study looked 738 Kentucky residents initial bout COVID-19 2020. 250 tested positive COVID-19 second time May July 2021, Delta variant became dominant US. found unvaccinated double risk reinfected Delta wave. Settle down, Mr. Pachino op-ed law school professor. wonder would think medical school professor writing op ed arguing conclusion legal experts wrong something. Texans mastered best safety practices per Abbott. He‚Äôs concerned calling special legislative session tomorrow voter fraud occurred here. üôÑ Nothing crickets hospitals reach capacity thresholds. November 2022 cannot come fast enough vote Abbott‚Äôs ass out! Texan, seems like Abbott getting killing us point Large population wide studies healthcare studies UK showed rate reinfections rare India also showed rare reinfection rates large delta wave. However, urgent care seen plenty people re-infected 3 times one year? find hard believe. Ah, missed part assumed it. [reduced risk reinfection already known human coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, virus causes COVID-19, documented. Currently, limited evidence concerning protection afforded vaccination reinfection SARS-CoV-2 added Kentucky residents infected SARS-CoV-2 2020, vaccination status reinfected May‚ÄìJune 2021 compared residents reinfected. case-control study, unvaccinated associated 2.34 times odds reinfection compared fully implications public health reduce likelihood future infection, eligible persons offered COVID-19 vaccine, even previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. Congrats! can't make everything safe mean give trying. Tourists counted cases home region here. Vaccination rates low PHO said transmissions happening unvaccinated locals (vaccination rates low specific part province, especially 18-49 year olds).

Edit add: new outbreaks long term care homes region, really isn‚Äôt good. lucky pick. Many people get ones offered. 

Some additional things consider: afaik vaccines safe. Even vector ones. However higher thrombosis risk. Especially female people somehow estrogen. 

Moderna/biontech-Pfizer nearly identical efficacy. friend circle, people got second moderna shot averse side effects biontech/Pfizer. moderna apparently gives antibodies average though. However, side effects rare either way. common fatigue arm pain. personally biontech/Pfizer shot suffered arm pain first shot 3 days nothing second. 


Best option ANTIBODIES wise combined vaccine receiving one dose vector vaccine first, boost mrna 3 months. gives antibodies best protection. HOWEVER, a) requires take vector vaccine, GP recommends males ages females 40. b) combination shots also give severe reactions frequently. However, also safe. might suck days shouldn‚Äôt afraid. Also people didn‚Äôt side effects even option.  wearing N95 mask give one hour time infected COVID high risk zone, wearing one give 3 minutes (20 times viral load without mask N95).

Does sound better? know entirely accurate give lay person idea effective masks compared none. propaganda way powerful right. hate cynical America gets point children start consistently dying, right find way spin brainwash people believe big deal. Sorry hear that. You‚Äôve probably done already, luck (in CA) calling pharmacies found provider willing give Pfizer. call two. month ago, however.  Except read another article, wasn‚Äôt tested back then. *assumed* he‚Äôd gotten it. believe Christian Scientists would oppose vaccination. could mistaken. Mmm‚Ä¶ well funny thing is: airlines already short staff. So‚Ä¶ correct way.    New anti-clickbait headlines used forever science, we?

I would direct study reported actual discussion could had, would've already done capable. yet... we're getting upwards 120k new cases per day... number climbing.

This country full fucking idiots They've convinced power God side. know, highest authority heaven side mean act un-Christlike possible everything okay~

The irony palpable. one drive either risk children‚Äôs lives drive. Hey, know I'm sorry went hope ok. moneys Texas.   Thanks information. I'm assuming since ingredients listed dont outright say anything I'm allergic fine? ingredients clearly scientific terms kinda boggling. make good point quite possibly faulty thinking lumping shot period changes together given dont know scientifically significant correlation yet. cover yourself.

Look fucking done. problem take health system them. local city office high ranking Missouri official today work local area network.  wearing hearty cloth mask offered chief staff ID vaccination card identity security protocols. Hey states ‚ÄúThis Missouri. don‚Äôt here‚Äù.

Do think mandating vaccine cause nursing shortage thus exacerbating deaths since less people cared for, really thing? Left always pro-id, bad right incompetent know use appropriately.   Ohio would like word y‚Äôall. I'll disagree 50% vaccinated, supposedly civilized highly developed natiion kind celebratory milestone deserves blue ribbon. 

If vaccination olympics, would medals US Team. probably need win, mental health comes IOWA! Mississippi? ain‚Äôt joke.  Texas? like eastern California, watch mandates like long plateau thats constantly increasing. Maybe explains children less severe outcomes. recent exposure Covid hit. Idk thought. ~~I think that's joke.~~  Nebraska wants join conga line wait November. Theres whole mob conspiracy people show right around 22nd. sudden, left pro id :/  Based article. Florida &amp; Texas best covid rules.  believe meant said. /r/thatsthejoke shouldn‚Äôt healthcare don‚Äôt believe industry. hear entertainment food industry hiring.

So business usual then? getting cynical people like last weeks. happy kind events least grateful see reporting possible wake call. news read feel exhausted instead. People dying beds making last wishes regretting themselves, ICU staff getting stressed lot say least even available, pandemic goes virus never let forget deadly careless is. 

[NY hospitalizations vs yeah guess acting upon scientific based risk assessment gets you. 

I wish point people vaccinations whatever way. think people better mandated they're incapable taking care instance. People may die day reason, contagious disease could take months (and let's hope years) fall unstressing numbers. variant could pop up, vaccine immunity may wane, get see stupidity disease daily wish would to. I'll you* Definitely good odds, see people acting like silver bullet careful all. doctor, African American community group people I‚Äôm understanding hesitant. Shamefully, science medical culture treated horrifically, even things improve. Yet another example ripple effect treating people poorly feel though less pressure initially conduct trials children OG strain seemed less risk them. Now, staring neck variant causing lot harm told mid-winter. Here's thing, conservative media lawmakers Governors said months months Vaccines necessary people need get them.  


Liberal media lawmakers said opposite.  


I care anecdote care mine, living OVERWHELMINGLY conservative Texas town like 30% vaccination rate. even 0.5% death rate matters kid **Resources/benefits family member ICU COVID?** 
Can anyone share resources financial \[or relevant\] assistance family member hospitalized COVID? hospitalized since July 23rd fully sedated ventilator (which 100% oxygen last couple days), doctor told us week survives, best case, looking 4-6 month hospitalized recovery. Even that, COVID-caused congestive heart failure rest life, yet know longterm effects may be. setting conservatorship trying figure pay medical care, rent (her younger son still lives home 19 earn near enough pay bills), utilities, car payment, etc. yet know amount, know debt well. also, course, considering selling car, moving younger son relatives, etc., reduce costs we're able to. addition current expenses, concerned cost potential longterm care fact may never able return career even working full time all. holding onto hope, trying prepare possibilities best can.

*(Not sure else post this, please direct somewhere better.)* know long term side effects catch covid.  Brain fog/damage, heart issues, lung capacity issues, kidney damage, loss smell/taste(i know someone caught covid 6 months ago still got sense smell back).  I'd rather take risk vaccine given hundreds millions people little issues risk known issues long covid death covid itself. Same. owners sent email saying unvaxxed cesspools know coming fucking wait see lazy selfish assholes come toe toe decisions. 

Are going quit lush job ever work 60 hrs week manual labor job avoid jab? 

More eleven! Why? also corrupt doctors. stuff hear say sound like living Christ.

I think usual explanation ""church tradition"". Even fire department short guys, would argue still hire arsonists. 

Any teacher cannot see vaccinated hugely important safety children his/her care (who cannot vaccinated yet all) classroom. true, doubt bad though. honestly worst part far ouchy arm wrong, kind richard. There's going ton push back then. voter ID racist people access get ID, restricting minorities traveling seemingly concerns. trying equate two issues, think going become huge talking point people happens. gladly take bunch non-FDA approved ‚Äúsupplements‚Äù ordered click bait ad online! nobody Idaho goes Canada? Yup! agree that. Oh that‚Äôs actually‚Ä¶ kinda soon! Yay! regardless party power

Both sides. Yawn.  admitted that. 50% Republicans vaxed. 

So republican/conservative thing. Democrats getting vaxed either. get N95's KN95's reasonable price well. *work*. Russia. It‚Äôs obviously plus opportunists Lollapalooza indication expect, 92% attendants vaccinated. best guess really opposed boycott long while.

That's much better vaccination rate almost anywhere go to. Yeah joke conservatives act like political affiliation religion, literally lot them. Liberals fucking idiots too, less destructive flavor. I‚Äôm curious parents start demanding vaccinated teacher see disruption causes unvaxxed teacher quarantine 10 days. Mediocre best subs constantly out. I‚Äôve got friend got Pfizer shots April/May Covid currently showing symptoms. Several large hospital systems, including own, already have. gave unvaccinated employees one month get first shot provide proof. 

I‚Äôve taken bit satisfaction pointing always quit don‚Äôt want (especially assholes who, seriousness, proposed elderly at-risk isolate themselves) adults many orders magnitude vulnerable got vaccinated. know working identifying correct doseage, made wonder much harm higher dose could possibly cause. 

Maybe smarter person come along illuminate. havent spoken either anti vaxx sisters almost 2 yrs now. crazy miss plans lives again. getting affected, since haven‚Äôt gotten cold last year? Yep, like flu seasons, hospital get overwhelmed used that. hear every year, year what's different year. think answer obvious, COVID drastic impact across entire healthcare system. children adults. get overwhelmed, lowers care anything everything else well causes get serious well. vicious cycle. I've seen people covered tattoos say want jab scared needles. Idiots. Called it. Announced today requiring proof vaccination negative test within 48 hrs event make seem like anti covid vaccine anti vaxers. simply wrong.

There many people vaccinated vaccines want covid one deadly. 

You create division saying people want vicious vaccine anti-vaxers. 

With many children attend school, safe say Americans anti-vaxers. FDA set agenda assumption adult vaccines would lower cases (and context made ton sense). There's way would required 4-6 months data knowing we'd massive surge children's cases late July. timeframe allow nice buffer get lots extra data make everyone feel extra good results, required confirm safe vaccine.

The American Academy Pediatrics know they're talking about, argument makes complete sense. Every day vaccine kids gets delayed *unnecessarily* (key word -- one suggesting skimp data) day kids get severely ill even die. point already data kids adults upon approval. start approval process ASAP. elementary teacher feel way next door Texas. mask mandate, idea isnt vaccinated, social distancing, informing parents positive cases. Appreciate bro! Effects not, there‚Äôs turning back haha. show proof religion  parents permitted opt-out making kids wear masks parents able opt-in kids vaccine they, themselves, taken.

Preventing kids wearing masks far seems dangerous taking vaccine. Canada waiting impatiently able vaccinate 10 years old too. teens double vaccinated already. rather start whole withholding-care--is-legit-because-people-contributed-to-their-condition thing. US insurance industry would love able withhold care people ""should known better""

First, I'm fan US healthcare industry favor universal healthcare system. Second, discussion *shortage* services care *has* rationed*,* withhold care general. Finally, difference ""pre-existing conditions"" involving lifestyle choices first place, choosing get vaccinated directly conclusively impacts people's health including literally *killing* them: overeating becoming obese cause people blow up, become obese, heart attacks couple weeks. Shooting heroin getting abscess whatever, cause people catch heroin abscesses, etc.

In US countries actual universal health care systems already, example, tell alcoholic liver disease quit drinking they're basically back line liver transplantation, enough livers everyone, like soon could (or arguably already case ECMO machines) enough capacity care critically ill patients. see different. 

Normally, I'm board caring equally, scenario there's shortage beds, life-saving equipment, etc., *have* choose treat, there's group A, try right protect (or wanted immunocompromised) *and others*, group B either even care, actively disregarded right thing *are putting others harm's way -* really see *less* ethical care absolutely *must* rationed, choose Group first.  Unfortunately, long problem messaging, covid even public health. People want simple yes nos, often leads also ignoring advice entirely binary.  Specifically Haredi Hasidic community. Even rabbis groups push vaccination freaking WhatsApp chains control. That‚Äôs twice number Republicans Democrats unvaccinated.

So yeah, big difference. medical decisions harm others. Sorry, lose bozo boggles mind hospitals nurses required get vaccines infectious illnesses. Hell get vaccines go college Man. Imagine it‚Äôs approved.  shit show would be. ""Great Flood""?? PCP (an MD, internal medicine) told crap even quoted Rand Paul. üò≠üò≠üò≠

Son, drugs talkin, it‚Äôs time stop takin drugs. Thank clearing misconception me. Orthodoxy zero issue vaccination. Don‚Äôt spew garbage, Orthodox worked vaccine, branches push hard.

This antivaxers infiltrating Haredi community New York. Nothing Judaism. put post simpler language people understand:

Being naturally infected probably gives better protection future infections vaccine.

However, vaccine give sore arm might give headache. natural infection might kill you, might cause serious long term effects, probably make miserable week.

Comparing side effects, obviously better getting vaccine. condolences. reporting see Australia relatives Perth rare. Looking NYT info looks like seven day average around 260 new cases miracle USA standards measure seven day average world cup stadium capacities. Certainly mean undersell conditions there. Ah gotcha. Sorry misunderstood. 

From understand yes higher number cases normal. that‚Äôs ‚Äúnormal‚Äù. like flu seasons worse others. Wdym ovulation signs? understanding one doesn‚Äôt ovulate pill.

That sucks though. continued taking pill normal you‚Äôre getting nothing withdrawl weeks? Stance hasn‚Äôt changed Thank clearing misconception me. Italians without smartphones.

Italy first country start getting mobile phones massively.  month. US Companies required accommodate religious beliefs practices employees, unless would cause undue hardship company. That's Civil Rights Act '64. 

It hardship lot healthcare areas. company liberal WFH policy, probably accommodate religious objectors without hardship. Yeah question considers ‚Äúprotection‚Äù anti-vax people don‚Äôt bad kids ‚Äúfeel‚Äù like protecting them. People like working vaccinated people. Right you! many dead Long Covid Totally understandable. Thanks continued efforts. I'm kind mind maybe shelve share crazy conspiracy theories vaccine pop head shower thought, little bit least. jagoff anti-vaxxers enough gasoline is. vaccinated *and* terrified? Copypasted comment made days ago:

Speaking Texan follows state/local politics closely:

Abbott originally whole-hog whatever could defeat COVID-19. moving quickly early days--when state--that almost afraid going close state borders leave locked home.

However, changed weeks pandemic Shelley Luther incident. look want, tl;dr that

* ritzy salon owner DFW area business closed state order;

* spite this, protested opening business regardless;

* punishment jail time fine. punishments meted out, Luther (and people state politics orbiting her) launched GoFundMe media PR blitz raised *ungodly* amounts attention money.

* also happened time former prez starting deviate initial COVID plan into...whatever ended doing. primary-voting faction party *loved* it.

* Combined, two pressure points forced Abbott let Luther jail waive punishments.

In essence, kind equivalent Syria crossed Obama's ""red line""...and anything it, made look weak *and* made extremely unpopular sides issue.

Abbott nothing man driven political instinct knows read tea leaves. incident, epic power failure/snowpocalypse caused billions damages froze scores Texans death, takeover state GOP Allen West (a real character left leadership position announce intent primary Abbott), Abbott realized incredibly unsafe position. want get primaried seen ""too liberal"" addressing COVID, 100% end career. lose Republican primary Texas, done for. 

Until Abbott fears losing primary inaction taking action, he's going jack squat. I‚Äôm confused Missouri data. could Rt get high wave? Stupidity...if religion. it‚Äôs conservatives African Americans Hispanics far behind white people % vaccinated Meanwhile, Texas Governor's office... 100% doesn‚Äôt GAF. catholics too. Lolwut?

So, countries epicenter pandemic, footed bill development production, dare prioritize themselves?

/Gasp

How selfish. Truly.

Seriously, fuck right off, whoever tries make sound like egoism.

Without US EU, would vaccine all. bet 99% people claiming needed see FDA approval absolutely idea drugs already take FDA approved. approved. approved. even lookup determine drug *is* FDA approved. different levels approval are. bet they've never read single publication FDA.

And even ""waiting approval"" past year, probably STILL learned things. extremely pro-life people object use fetal stem cell line production vaccines (namely J&amp;J one). fetal cells present vaccine, use cloned line generate intermediate virus transport spike protein code cells. current vaccines used lines *testing*, development. 

Personally, even extremely pro-life (which I'm not), would consider worse getting organ transplant murder victim. refusing gift bring person back, might well make best it. Yeah, say please multiple times, said thank you. completely polite? think imagining kind mocking never getting defensive...that's you. take mods took original post. 

Take look Fig 3 actual study: one false positive border detection threshold -- ""confident"" false positive simply literally border. infer chart, people designed sVNT need convert continuous range percent inhibition yes/no score. chose 30% based statistical observations convenience, opposed something like 31% 32.13%. ideal test would clear empty zone low valued high values, test decent job overall. However, I'm convinced, based know cutoff ranges calculated general, three January 2020 also least potentially false positives. Feel free educate know design tests do. would lot confident three values way top like 2021 data points.

Also, cross-contamination also thing, regardless test performance characteristics.

And, already know virus circulating Europe 2019, possible traveler brought US then, infecting deer well. mean get Europe Wuhan.

I'm saying wan't point finger Wuhan, would expect actual patient zero closely tied also first noticed (Wuhan). phylogenic studies also pointing strongly bat and/or pangolin (which found Asia Africa), specific bat found one province China IIRC. study convince uncertain terms outbreak start Wuhan. But, still interesting, hope nice night realize we're attack you.

Happy hear thoughts 2018 ILI another time (and case clear, mocking you, genuinely curious). ""You took hand, made man!"" predictions seem hone early September Outreach one.

Depends state, think there's proper data country wide numbers. 

For example VA well vaccinated :

Like people genuinely need face problems hardship level sheltered ignorant actively harmful others.  England 90 percent start delta. single shot percentage even high now.

Covid killed her. didn‚Äôt get Covid would still alive. 

Your comment beyond dumb.  Well, know that. thought caught vaccine I'd freaking right wondering going die.

Hard pass hard see Australia winning vaccination race delta variant much circulation already happening. delay hospitalizations deaths two weeks. Deaths increased months. Deaths following hospitalizations. ""took 6 weeks go back 100,000 (documented cases per day) despite vaccine""

I literally say comment why. 

Higher R0 + open country 

(btw, US November last year number cases, probably 50% that, there's likely higher % asymptomatic + less testing Spin way like. People getting sick. lot them. six weeks went okay okay.

The faster spreads, faster peak goes away. 

The ones dying still largely 50+ (mostly 65+) EXCUSE vaccinated likely still vaccinated 6 months cuz...reasons. Anecdotally, recently returned large golf trip one guys said day one wasn‚Äôt shaking hands anyone keeping distance wasn‚Äôt feeling well. golfed first day skipped next two left early day four. 

Just heard got worse he‚Äôs treated Covid pneumonia. fully vaccinated back March. 

We can‚Äôt get complacent sleep fact breakthrough cases happen.  also question losing successes zero Covid allowed Chinese government ""to claim approach superior Western approach, associated general failure containing virus, even claim superiority Chinese political system,"" said Prof ""If start abandoning turn mitigation, basically endorsing Western approach trashed.""

Ideology systems, competing respond pandemic. I'm sure meant ""drain swamp."" many antivaxxers back day Salk vaccine came out, wonder many kids would wheelchairs. Fast food chains can't recall candy companies mass market campaigns. I'm also Northeast time kids get school, weather nice running around outside part. least neighborhood kids obesity issues, adults kids look like kids grew with. They're running around plat, girls gymnastics boys whacking baseballs playing hoop.

Maybe culture different, kid parents kicked us house go play something. somewhat goes today neighborhood good chunk home owners actually grew kids. New England probably closer European culture rest country. Things somewhat walkable, probably helps child autonomy. There's two parks easily within walking distance terrain pretty hilly get lots exercise well. also health physical education requirement graduation, 100 minutes per week.

I think shocking me, something see every day. I'm vaccinated, approach seems like total overkill. Vaccines work, still worried getting covid despite vaccination, I'd use nasal spray meeting someone. need cut anyone.  suddenly see Bhutan showing everywhere reading 'Seveneves'? Don‚Äôt obtuse. Mandating vaccine public health nothing new perfectly reasonable.

Those would oppose mandates people would cry foul government regulations, seatbelt laws, non-smoking laws airports, common sense measures. get second chicken pox shot 25 finally got around going college turned never got 2nd one.

Every school around 100% back normal, full go sports band choir, distancing, masks, full lunchrooms. already bad even following basic guidelines last year, kids obvious symptoms sent back class, nurse called parents, said allergies, so... actual evidence delta worse rate serious outcomes variants? spreads easier sure shown dangerous beyond anecdotal interviews news? Absolutely not. place even close herd immunity. Also, that‚Äôs global question city question since cities don‚Äôt exist themselves. preamble also says constitution ""Promote General Welfare."" Goddam It‚Äôs early reading thread. guess can‚Äôt blame people stupid‚Ä¶or I? Food thought ant vaxers there, literally public figure respect, whether left right recieved vaccine. hill want die on. You‚Äôll fun flat earth. Good luck, right thing. No, they're unconstitutional kiss ass end time.   event hospital overload, happening now, *do* fall back severe triage triage based past behavior impact death.

No one likes this, surge events kind to. Knowing Live Nation / Ticketmaster they'll probably partner lab testing company validate results charge $38 fee convenience. Lockdowns would never happen US think agree you.

Elsewhere world find masks still mandatory lot settings. Whether thwarts spread virus matter contention, think wearing mask critical us all, USA abroad, global pandemic, goodness' sake. please show law states right?

P.S. vaccines don‚Äôt inject covid. stabbed tomato needle injected you, injected tomato. went took protein makes tomato hold water injected it, didn‚Äôt inject tomato. That‚Äôs exactly vaccines work.

Yes, hospitals full we‚Äôre sick shit again. comment merit, understand covid better dialed treatment options, feels less chaotic March 2020. misspelled 120K+.... mean, give valid scientific reason paranoid covid *immediately* following confirmed via RT-PCR natural infection post-vaccination maybe I'd take people seriously. covid case literally closed past Wednesday. pretty safe say I'm almost certainly completely immune prevalent variants right now. 

There's reasonably cautious, there's everybody downvoting me. like I'm wearing mask generally social distancing, people judgy instead really thinking I'm saying. Obviously know vaccine stop infection anymore otherwise infected; unfortunately, household exposed anyone really talking delta breakthrough cases bringing mask recommendations back. *The programmer entered chat!*  ‚Ä¶ know cloth face covering likely come several times throughout day (the lunch room comes mind) end COVID protection.

You're right that. starters could *also* mitigate students eat damn lunch room first place.  never begin with. Probably moral posturing end. Lollapalooza 100k....  saw! I've enjoying comments fb post Year old recycled rite wing talking points...yawn. Nothing new propaganda overlords eh?   Smdh   I‚Äôm free walk streets without afraid mugged shot. supposed release vaccine? *After* pandemic? Lol read post loud promise sound smart head. Correct, mass vaccinations. level would need. Yea man, course actually true. 

I think mean virus deadly kills host reproduce evolutionary fit, true. But, SARS2 like -- contagious typically early infection (even presymptomatic) selective pressure evolve less deadly.  one measure large impact spread (when done correctly), social distancing, finally vaccines. one ever said one measure would stop it. multi-front approach safety. 

Go practice science denial elsewhere. order get natural immunity covid *catch* covid. 

You‚Äôre rolling dice severe case long term effects get. even you‚Äôre rolling dice future immunity. 

The one thing know vaccines they‚Äôre extremely safe produce minimal side effects, *greatly* reduce effects severity illness average. 

You lose literally nothing getting vaccine, you‚Äôre rolling dice catching covid. mention data preliminary looking best.

I don‚Äôt know put bluntly. may tempted go ‚Äúoh I‚Äôm young, I‚Äôll fine‚Äù, there‚Äôs literally reason so. potentially harms you, creates greater risk everyone else around you.  sure CA VA, news able get states CDC literally missing huge opportunity track National level Hear* went live nation concert once. Never back since. go university concerts, winery's small venues live nation. Yes eradicated measles mass vaccination, shutting everything down. ...or submit testing. Let's get rid part. Thankfully top answers far common festival/outdoor event pre-COVID (typically dust/dirt breathe in). show rights given up? would support literally measure slowed spread virus? parents rights choose objectively dangerous choices impacting children supersede kids rights? comes masks?

When decided catering nuts would build base future political aspirations. argument places way much power cloth masks. Let‚Äôs face it, cloth masks alone little prevent transmission certain environments. CDC waffled explicitly stating access. (Remember double triple masking touted Spring?)

N95s KN95s work. say piece cloth going prevent collapse hospitals incredibly short-sighted look situation. 

If want protect children absolutely risk associated COVID, keep home. realize it‚Äôs incredibly nuanced situation kids absolutely benefit classroom, send school‚Ä¶ know cloth face covering likely come several times throughout day (the lunch room comes mind) end COVID protection. need drive streets medical truck give shots home. suspect age range decided companies, based size, physical maturity ages. lot 12 year olds already weights adults. Many mature liver/kidneys/organs. Smaller kids mean different sized doses, well immature organs different immune systems. They're free want. they're free endanger others choice. stay home refuse help themselves. seems crazy even talking reopening schools year. 

By law, kids 12 vaccinated, big chunk parents families vaccinated either. Delta variant proving much contagious ""classic"" version.

I know everyone hearts set schools open year, things definitely changed. What? Where? How? made appointment online got free close contact.  sure true...Iceland 90% population fully vaxxed going Delta surge now. epidemiologist basically said, vaxxed people get much unvaxxed spread well...only difference WAY less likely get hospitalized die. They've quite lot breakthrough cases interesting follow since probably country world majority population fully vaxxed. One wrinkle: continue interact (vaxed not) transmit virus, likely vaccine-resistant variant arises. go get tests then. They‚Äôre free everywhere Shut please darkest days pre vaccine  need educate really went on. Behind scenes. Vaccinated looking forward concerts later year. Zero reasons worry, hate headlines. Also, math wrong. .004 .004% .004 0.4%. Nearly 1 200. root problem monopolies illustrated here. doesn‚Äôt compete business driver business area. Let competing outfit compete business practices thoughtful way watch business die adjust behavior.   find hard believe judge would sympathetic mother situation Agreed Yah rate increase whole week FL slowed. Hopefully peaked next week brings decreases deaths since January 2020 age group 73 million people it. Again, risk assessment skills horrible

First, conceding fact increasingly morally bankrupt society, start talking children‚Äôs lives like this?

Second, data cherry-picked incomplete. Good least cherry-picking CDC data, CDC said Delta variant new yet determined severity children. have, however, reversed stance masking, even vaccinated people, preliminary data seems great, Bob. 

Finally, charts reflect RSV MIS-C case data children. Sorry shitty limited risk assessment skills compelled none whatsoever. That's passive aggressive. confronted people directly. 

One guy particularly memorable. told ""There's sign door. special. rules"". said ""stop yelling lady"" (my husband thinks part hilarious) said ""put mask asshole"". said ""hey call asshole lady"". left store. 

Toxic masculinity reduced little boy using mom voice. Yes, know mandates traditionally come president. 

Sufficie say I've realized asshole. thought id requirement vaccine. That's fair point, addressed lowering removing requirement, accepting working class poor able get vaccinated. I've success pointing high risk acquiring erectile dysfunction. Now, anybody info bit play half audience too, I'd interested hear it. UK‚Äôs peak two weeks ago, think seeing actual huge decline COVID mortality. Deaths inevitably rise won‚Äôt come close previous waves. know much ones didnt come back? reasoning was? UK pretty much open everything Freedom Day whatever? feel tbh. Flipside tho continue interact transmit virus (vaxed not) increase likelihood vaccine-resistant variant emerging.  want get way ""natural selection"". might find pre-print interesting: looks sequencing NYC sewage samples. evidence non-human covid reservoirs New York - possibly rats dogs. know what. works perfectly.  never said parents lmfao said self righteous friends neighbors feel duty either shame submission force vaccine policies you. btw ethically wrong doctors physicians force things patient dont approve. whats next himmler? Round everyone doesnt get vaccinated send camps? interested see people react starting next month people became pregnant getting vaccine start give birth. sure point declining birthrates evidence, completely ignoring fact lot people put kids middle pandemic (or decided since saw jacked many humans are). Truth. got Type1 38. originally diagnosed Type 2 even doctors stupid ‚Äúonly kids get Type1‚Äù bias.

Asymptotic people/people experienced covid cold flu brain damage. everyone, proud us this, Kirk Cousins known calculating, fake, politically correct, caricature model QB Leader image. teammates trashed says ""all right things"" act make look good. They've said can't trust he's never ending stream QB sound bytes.

By accounts teammates, everything Kirk Cousins says planned designed make Kirk Cousins look great.

I can't go details would violate rule 4, mind, clear Kirk positioning future roles certain tv networks public offices certain groups shown propensity value former athletes washed celebrities.

He's got maybe 3 years left NFL. He's planning future. knows exactly needs ""speak for"" make future happen. betting man, I'd say he's got vaccine report cause wants maintain image.

Make mistake, comments HUGE future career It'll interesting see happens Florida. I've following Iceland want pessimistic even struggling Delta surge right that's 90% eligible population vaxxed additional 3% partially vaxxed. basically realized vaxxed people spread covid much unvaxxed people (I kind expected remember sub thought baloney long ago glad kept wearing mask indoors). Good news hospitalizations much lower vaxxed people, fifth far previous peaks...but hospitalizations double vaxxed people unvaxxed moment. enough put strain healthcare system they've added restrictions. Kind curious US considering vaccination numbers much lower.  Suffice say made effort research subject all.

As result, next idea talking about, neither lengthy history, mandating.  wouldn‚Äôt call majority, it‚Äôs much larger would thought possible. shame missed EU's amazing vaccine programme...  it‚Äôs normally 70%, that‚Äôs mean.

Even aside illness like COVID, cleaning indoor air quality would pay huge dividends health. Heck, pitch companies boost productivity trash levels PM2.5 office buildings, maybe bite. look total number kids hospital, numbers actually pretty unremarkable. last weeks steady around \~45. 

April numbers 60-90. winter surge 100.

Granted, though, direction cases great \~25 six weeks ago. Essentially judge making something positive community condition probation.

Because political mandate vaccine blanket basis (though states done before), we're going instead see condition 1000 different things. me, part problem peoples undying obsession ""winning"" arguments every aspect life.

People seem want slam, witty comeback, call out, mic drop.. regardless impact words. like facade strength important actual strength character.

Darwinism best Four hundred sixty-three primary cases reported within two weeks rally, another 186 identified secondary contacts, making 649 total cases traced back event. specimens available ""full genome sequencing"" identify rally super-spreader, CDC reported ""many characteristics superspreading event.""

They extrapolate based available information. can't trace spread far past secondary contacts. One-third Minnesota counties cases traced back Sturgis. 463 primary cases, 3.7% hospitalized one person died. man died Minnesota, according state health department.

They can't trace everybody get enough information form estimate cases equivalent 140 per 100,000 attendees. study pointed likely underestimate anyone symptoms mild COVID case may gotten tested.

I know sound snarky confrontational, genuinely want answer. I‚Äôm pretty sure mindset unfortunate by-product 40 years‚Äô worth late-night infomercials law offices offering get people compensation harm caused *commercial products,* *actual medications prescribed distributed doctors.* first person told that. always thought gamble would give lifelong side effects, vaccine covid. I'm gonna play game lol. cool think NBD - you. defend me, I'm providing stats. conservatives want die stupidity, stop them? kids get better education ? Ugh last sentence gave sinking feeling. I‚Äôve less locked haven‚Äôt seen friends year half, I‚Äôm ready done shit. It‚Äôs though, sucks. annoying gonna inconvenience gets people vaccinate rather caring public health. company Texas location announced start requiring use PTO go without pay need quarantine vaccinated. England Scotland case rates started dropping week school years ended. reopened surprising flattened out.

Everyone assumption reproductive rate dropped 1.2 0.8 week infections virus ""burning out"", possible. I'm Upper West Side, feels fine, here. Almost everyone supermarket masked, etc., even though high vaccination rate here. Cases averaging 5 times higher month ago.

Deaths twice high month ago.


Check back September see many people infected today, die next weeks. I've several movies year. one yet sitting super close anyone go with. problem going. Oh definitely true, need many people possible get vaccine try fight thing together, think disproven idea vaccinated can‚Äôt spread dangerous. getting around names already database? Chickens came home roost, huh Rachel?

Gonna leave right Slippery slope, 100% board covid. 

It makes sense ‚Äònot spread deadly disease‚Äô condition. 

I‚Äôd also love mandate type government assistance vaccination string attached. don‚Äôt get taxpayer funded threat community. Dead people barred bringing lawsuits. Perhaps surviving relatives able benefit death vaccination. Sympathy burnout real man Meh, wish greater difference, especially may people anti-vaxx anti-mask too, would also contribute. please leave  think vast majority people going shoot people  don‚Äôt want inadvertently infect someone isn‚Äôt vaccinated

That would fault, yours.  infuriating really burnt too. :( sure that? case don‚Äôt know recall works, two simple questions ballot. recalled so, finish term. simple majority needed Newsom removed right latest poll UC Berkley, losing 48% 46% would remove office. telling thing poll fact 54% Hispanics Asians favor recall. Obviously poll coming one left leaning university city nation. 

He‚Äôs serious trouble demographics overwhelmingly vote democrat ultimately spell demise. Deaths per cases down, sure, means people getting sick, including less likely die. people would died alpha still dying delta unvaccinated. What's point? CDC consistent whole time, think it. know enough delta variant back May.

You say hire media expert ... let's say never change mask guidance. June people would complaining CDC way strict, ""cases going down."" There's way win. Whatever do, they'll criticized. spread vaccinated people, fine.

If spread anti-vaxxer idiots, care. *will* end getting point anyway.  Yeah, one guy/gal FDA working full vaccine approval needs vacations rest making phone calls. major crisis, assign literal ARMY people rush approval past paperwork hurdles?  fully vaxxed, take whatever want. Unless like 80 year overweight person, personal risk high. law pretty clear can‚Äôt hold people inject vaccine - Including polio. doesn‚Äôt mean can‚Äôt set mandate requires vaccine society: Workplaces, shops, etc.

In case, part punishment getting vaccine part agreement - guess would get tossed guy wanted fight it.  personally dont want door door jabbing happening, 

but like said, government allowed regulate government institutions private businesses allowed mandate themselves. 

I thought people worried door door jabbing like Peruvian here, remark: vaccinated Sinopharm yes, mostly Pfizer. double month ago.


When cases 20,000 day. ‚Äòcool it‚Äô NSW premier dropped ball country lockdown. Everyone know depressed/angry/tired lockdowns previous. fully vaccinated personally it. Either I'd wait weeks crowds go down, catch early late night weekday showing.  additional background worry course long COVID. 

We know virus affects neurological system. kids mild asymptomatic cases, suffer something much dire years hence?

Maybe that‚Äôs issue, maybe not. problem, imagine terrible impact coming years. Make required school!! Exactly. risks vaccinated people minimal. really reason taking full advantage summer. looks unlikely Canada since they've stalled 80% vaccines widely available now. Ireland, UK, Malta, Iceland, Spain Portugal seem likely reach that. mean ‚Äúoutrun vaccines‚Äù? current vaccines still effective even Delta variant. sure it‚Äôs outrunning it. I'm sorry dont believe excuse. Like get many black people suspicious certain things, theres much proof evidence vaccine works, ignore willful ignorance.  made policy said, ‚ÄúYou must eat pork fired,‚Äù would illegal discriminates people practice Jewish Islamic religions.

Such policy would reasonable connection job, would clearly pretext discrimination. vaccine requirement *is* job-related, though. I‚Äôm saying isn‚Äôt done. I‚Äôm saying, we‚Äôve seen lot progress last 30 years. need put way nose. Even recent PCR testing, closer front nose. brain-tickle nasopharyngeal swab test got year ago one earlier ""lab box"" testing units. Every one anterior nasal swab.

""Accurate"" extent they're likely correctly identify people may infectious, miss double digit percentages those.

I've made argument before, [based Dr. Michael Mina make distinction medical diagnostic test public health screening.

With medical diagnostic test, want accurate be. expensive take longer, want clinician best possible information make medical decisions. That's basically PCR test. One problems we're using PCR public health screening tool, isn't.

With public health screening, want something fast, cheap, simple, ""good enough"" accurate. screening give people go/no-go signal going world. PCR expensive takes long.

That's antigen tests be: would give whole bunch everyone, ask test frequently, and, they're positive, isolate/contact trace, etc. matter 20% false negative rate, reducing transmission 80% every cycle. Even monster like Delta's R0 6+, knocking 80% transmissions would make Rt manageable enough reduce rest way good enough masks and/or good enough vaccines.

But antigen tests cheap enough everyone twice week. things CVS cheap enough that. think Dr. Mina's lab developed something close strip paper changes color detects SARS-COV-2, FDA nixed it, FDA ""medical diagnostic"" mindset (i.e., new COVID diagnostic close PCR terms accuracy), rather public health screening tool mindset (eh, 80% good enough make cheap enough). Casual scan newest 200 comments, roughly 25 posts word positive it. good news requiring Vax Negative Test helped keep (anecdotal) tests much lower rate could been. strong desire self preservation, mostly. Thank you, though.  many ppl total live United States? Probably says blood transfusions Australian here. know. leaders aren‚Äôt listening. It‚Äôs cherry picking talking making mandated‚Ä¶. consider even extreme scenarios creating legislation it‚Äôs there, it‚Äôs permanent, it‚Äôs hard change needed. argument based freedom choose presented world realistically couldn‚Äôt choose two choices. Lambda (still) heavily dominating Peru, couple days ago country's health minister referred Delta contagious, followed report ministry health showing gone 0.2% 7% couple weeks, also spreading several new regions. Based uploads GISAID, preliminary indications Ecuador's Brazil's % probably already similar higher levels; local authorities Rio de Janeiro said already 45% city S√£o Paulo (aka populous city Americas) 20%. relative numbers important; parts South America stepped sequencing levels fairly decent overall picture what's going on, they're getting details e.g. North America Europe getting much higher sequencing rates.

Anyway, Peru's surge Delta frequency quite closely resembles pattern we've already seen parts world, remains seen it'll continue it'll impeded Lambda. Right now, Peru's vaccination program increased specific regions detected, they're fearing Delta could lead another peak infections. happened Rio de Janeiro, receiving twice ""normal share"" vaccines country's health authorities. Certainly definite data, suggest Peruvian Brazilian authorities suspect Delta transmissible Lambda. ty service I‚Äôve going movie theaters since reopened Virginia around last Labor Day (and DC proper earlier year). Obviously back pretty empty ironically felt really safe, masking choosing off-peak showings (which anyway often not). Recently they‚Äôve crowded, I‚Äôm still going, masking eating popcorn. Since people aren‚Äôt talking option sitting masked, it‚Äôs probably bit safer crowded bar restaurant. Daily first doses keep ticking states.

[We've trending month 400k/day earth shattering, thought would keep going aside busts due newly elgible populations. Pediatric hospitals filling south. Things changed. understand things last year delta higher viral load kids getting infected higher rates severe disease. live city said hospital. could give less shit tbh. 3000+ deaths reported last week (according back 9-11 every week again.

As yesterday 7-day average 486 deaths per week rising quickly. 750 deaths yesterday. lag bit, they're happening. scary thing Texas Medical Center located Houston, we‚Äôre better equipped region most, region straining shit really bad. customer service customers treat like dirt always right, oh irony.  comment automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Parents home homeschool kids home. actual virtual teachers review things explain things.


That way parents homeschooling blind actual teachers verifying everything.and providing structure. ‚ÄúPersonal offense‚Äù 

All asked community referring to. you‚Äôre ignorant even name you‚Äôre talking outside ‚ÄúOrthodox‚Äù monolith, mean incredible spread beliefs, speaks me. swear people's basic risk assessment skills went fucking window due media.

And math skills, too. way got percentage number just... even close accurate, unless think every single person got vaccinated also got infected. FDA approval process precisely, specifically designed prevent case *drugs put human body.* 

The FDA regulate ingredients commercial insulation, sound-proofing materials, talcum powder, cigarettes, vitamin supplements, gasoline, etc. Don‚Äôt conflate consumer products *medical treatments drugs.*

Shady company practices exist. Sometimes cause harm general public. FDA exists make sure **drugs** cause direct harm *to human bodies* outweigh benefits said drug treatment. think legally provide exemptions religious (and perhaps philosophical) reasons. wrestling fan, fuck jericho

as music fan, fuck jericho (and includes judas)

‚Äúi‚Äôm winnipeg, idiot‚Äù *still* makes laugh every time though Here‚Äôs latest chart showing 7-day running average deaths:. running little 500 deaths day, average. Thats 15k deaths per month. 

If compare case chart, it‚Äôs easy see deaths lag month. mortality rates hold, see death rate move much next month. 

Perhaps highest levels, affected. population younger. think 16k plenty stop dumbasses would try  I'd really like visit there. ran room patients probably want one. Exactly. pretty annoying important piece info gets skipped over. Don‚Äôt forget deaths among full vaxxed.

If older person, especially health conditions even fully vaxxed still quite bit risk death, obviously much lower non-vaccinated still much higher risk vaxxed younger people even many unvaxxed young people. reimbursed Fema

So true.

Something reminds people claim COVID can't big deal stacks bodies streets people falling dead work. seem care people dying sight hospital ambulance workers calmly profesionally trying give care privacy. whatever reason, people see things bad they're movie-style dramatic.

You‚Äôre making point Sir. 600 extra cases, 17 hospitalization one death known many opinion (and apparently CDC agrees ‚Äúsizable‚Äù ) CDC also says numbers lower actual. supreme court wrong. Particularly direct case 1905 case 1965, debatable relevant argument made.

Legality never equaled morality. Furthermore, supreme court one country.  FDA actually requires new drugs shown safe adults test children. It‚Äôs dropped ball, it‚Äôs safety regulation.

The truth uncertainty, takes time understand new things say things high degree confidence. CONTEXT, conspiracy trick public spreading COVID-19 amongst other, medical professionals hoard n-95 masks. point shortage directly **influenced public policy**. Twist however want.

That, kind elaborate conspiracy theory alluding to, different things. Must world wide stance JWs. wife who‚Äôs early 30s grew Jehovah‚Äôs Witness, left cult around 12. never vaccinated got tetanus around 7 measles 20s 2 years got together.

Folks acting like liberties risk hope bs covid vaccines would make people start asking questions. hope died comment section. antivax hill people like die on

Did ever post anything remotely ""anti-vax""? Seriously, let know sister would disown me.  make wonder we, society, allow police claim ""fear life"" excuse execute people street, numbers show fucking actually value life all. makes goddamned sense.    don‚Äôt even kids, say ‚Äòevil you‚Äô fuck right off. shitty parent follow law send kids school, even follow every single precaution available, depend views practices everyone else around protect children‚Äôs safety? would tear heart send kids door every day knowing day could day kid comes home sick.    DeSantis giant shithead. saying true previous variants Delta. 

‚ÄúThe study details COVID-19 outbreak started July 3 Provincetown, Mass., involving 469 cases. found three-quarters cases occurred fully vaccinated people. Massachusetts high rate vaccination: 69% among eligible adults state time study. 

It also found significant difference viral load present breakthrough infections occurring fully vaccinated people cases, suggesting viral load vaccinated unvaccinated persons infected coronavirus did. shut due lack interest.   I'm curious, extra vaccination provide? I've always confused want learn. single dose effective Delta. means effectively, single dose count useless.  still get two arrested charged yet. They're willfully committing mass negligent homicide. music video probably one best outside Might Giants Tiny Toons songs. always crack too. I'll probably 100 years old still remember them. live nyc went protests, everyone waiting explosive results. everyone masked, get other's faces.

It really seems actively super close absolutely give fucks. Even subways, try keep bit distance before, can. Nice! What's consensus mRNA vaccines trigger autoimmune reactions certain people?

Is likely could see increase autoimmune disorders next several years?

(I'm vaccines entirely unbiased question) Keyword ""maximum"". making 100k plus year even hit unemployment benefits. states unemployment 50% normally make. possible thyroid issues unknown.

Good. refuse vaccinate wear mask distance made choices. 

They responsible medical costs decisions well. Vaccine products received persons experiencing breakthrough infections Pfizer-BioNTech (159; 46%), Moderna (131; 38%), Janssen (56; 16%); among fully vaccinated persons Massachusetts general population, 56% received Pfizer-BioNTech, 38% received Moderna, 7% received Janssen vaccine One vaccinated, hospitalized COVID-19 patient received Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine three received Janssen vaccine.

So, small numbers, 7% vaccinated J&amp;J, 16% breakthrough cases J&amp;J, 75% breakthrough hospitalizations cluster J&amp;J. agreed- seems lot anecdotal stories .. reports pediatric ICUs filling states low vaccination rate..i‚Äôm worried schools starting soon.. think impacting kids way read / hear ..

I'm ready get citation wars please note South America largely using Corovac (Chinese) vaccine studies mostly focusing vaccine's interactions Lambda, opposed mRNA vaccines. two classes vaccines quite different lab studies' indicators efficacy also quite different.

Here's [report American Academy (PDF warning). Different groups classify ""children"" differently (the cut date 14, 17, 18, 19, 20). purposes it'll overcount deaths, anyway, since we're concerned kids 12 can't vaccinated.

There's total \~150k child cases July1st-July 29th. time period, 23 children (however state defines it) died.

Children *are* dying covid...but need take consideration number relatively low.

Compared couple thousand elderly dying every single day last winter, situation much better. Wait, ran hospital beds Houston?

Well. accept covid ones. believes science, believes vaccines, believes masks. fully vaccinated wearing mask since told new CDC guidance. (Living media does, even realize Florida covid crisis told him.)

Sure, there's probably would stay home something resembling conscience, even they're they're sick, there's way would pretend like issue. Especially super mild symptoms.

That fucking narcissistic selfish people are. number likely stay entire lives. virus disappear, common flu. remember, cannot loosen rules yet even vaccinated transmission rates low enough. High risk individuals can't forgotten Good point. DISCLAIMER I‚Äôm scientist doctor I‚Äôm armchair analyst reads lot covid rudimentary understanding stuff. follows personal understanding even may incorrect. research.

The problem line thinking mutation makes delta transmissible seems thing makes resistant ancestor strain antibodies: it‚Äôs mutation spike protein. remember early pandemic one prevalent arguments biologists gave covid originating nature called sub-optimal binding ACE2 receptors? basically said ‚Äúcovid good efficient job infecting humans.‚Äù us lay persons didn‚Äôt really understand that, us seemed like covid spread across globe like wildfire must certainly good job.

Well, problem is, scientists right. Like usual. Covid really sub-optimal. mutations making optimal. spike protein changed much easily stick receptors, easily break cells does.

Incidentally believe changes spike protein also helps virus resist vaccines. ‚Äústicky‚Äù antibodies harder time plugging up. stick right cells right away antibodies completely cover every inch spike protein prevent that. antibodies coded old spikes new spikes different code can‚Äôt stick certain parts spike.

Mutations random mutations make virus successful end getting spread become new domain strain. Maybe 99 100 mutations won‚Äôt effective immunity. 1 mutation might reach vaccinated person, spread it. 2 months later, that‚Äôs main version virus spreading around.

Opinion eh‚Ä¶. things illegal states problem many people assumed got vaccine would automatically immune. Coupled fact even 30% people vaccinated CDC listed mask mandates, beginning summer nonetheless, people automatically assume safe. 

In opinion, someone working public health, poor choice decided hope people would get vaccinated. Unfortunately, great job large-scale messaging education vaccines protect 100%, tested nobody walking around zero precautions, also tested Delta variant arose. Thanks! mood That's strawman. people commenting vaccinated. 

It legitimate question. would vaccine seems replicate protein spike effective naturally occurring protein spike? No, said people Biden Kamala implied seem know BS immediately backpedaled that. yes See comment -- least two states track percent breakthrough infections. Well here's hoping they've got sort natural antibodies previous infections. Maybe actually got vaccine.

Nah I'm pretty sure 0. I'd say using government club force people something body pretty moral. got vaccinated kind authoritarianism hard, *hard* me. wonder much due studying vaccine created pre delta/other variant world, studying people likely infected delta variants. That's pretty self-centered way looking things. Humans interconnected way carrying thoughts memories forward far future. born, can't go back never born greater scheme things. Reading understanding. Sadly jobs start mandating vaccines across board it'll almost impossible reach number. even make incentives like unemployment welfare eligibility prove vaccine status. 

Another good one would another stimulus check people get jab.

Imagine every door restaurant public building opened held up-to-date vaccine card scanner. would great. Unvaccinated people would choice stay home get vaccine. ways cope reality. Lol let ask this, China simultaneously infringe people‚Äôs rights strict ‚Äúauthoritarian‚Äù lockdowns cases pop lying total number cases deaths? could understand POV little mitigate talked needing sacrifice grandma economy come let‚Äôs think logically here. deadly nothing ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs overrunning health care systems school, biological matter wondering too. I‚Äôm actually surprised many adults afraid get shot. Actually, Supreme Court already ruled government fact protect stupid people vaccinate them. Real headline says artist show Could've stopped ""based"" Y‚Äôall really gonna give rights?

What right referring to? right refuse basic public health requirements face crisis? right never been. Even Supreme Court ruled this. (Look Jacobson v. Massachusetts.)

The claims made next sentence nonsense. vaccine ""give Covid"" nobody claims cure. don‚Äôt right murder people. 100% Constitutional done before. What‚Äôs hilarious lot people getting offended Australians they‚Äôre. Actually cool things going general Covid response (other vaccine rollout) ^ Disinformation killing people. Here's another today. [Reduced Risk Reinfection SARS-CoV-2 COVID-19 think really air. really seems like concensus studies vaccination better everything else people grasping straws justify desire get vaccinated.    I'm getting tired ""it's fatal"" argument. There's 4-6 week lag regular covid initial exposure death (a week present symptoms, another week hospitalization, weeks hanging death). last week's cases labor day weekend's deaths. 

Exponential growth terrifying context. Polio vaccine stops spreading people though right? Covid vaccine doesn‚Äôt that. different.  go back pre-vaccine paranoia, mental health never recover. know I‚Äôm 100% immune, pretend can‚Äôt go back living like that. great achievement.

Alternatively, consider it‚Äôs entirely possible one first class degree physics arts subject utterly ignorant biology virology. degree someone years ago means almost nothing point.

I know plenty graduates ex poly non Russell group unis lapping anti vax bullshit; one thing common zero biology education beyond secondary school.  DeSantis wants ""protect parents' freedom choose whether children wear masks.""

In news... also wants protect parents freedom choose whether kids wear seatbelts, football hockey helmets, infants use car seats, etc. etc.

When parents rights choose objectively dangerous choices impacting children supersede kids rights? comes masks?   family, NC KY, wear mask store, sure, said: Big family gatherings? worries, masks! 

I don‚Äôt get it. Somehow heads it‚Äôs okay it‚Äôs family. that's case, VAST majority hospitalized dying unvaccinated? I‚Äôm find sympathy waining. Really? feel like would say someone know overweight need make change, would accused fat shaming.  Here's real headline 

Live Nation Allows Artists Require Vaccination Proof Negative Test Result U.S. Concerts sponsor vaccination events workers pay shots addition giving time vaccinate needed. Point still stands  making argument. meant prediction future arguments. Nothing misleading. ‚ÄúIn context, vaccines provide sterilizing immunity (and therefore continue permit transmission) lead buildup large standing populations virus [47], greatly increasing risk immune escape.""

If case worrying see comes next. vaccinated far less likely get infected first place better antibodies effectively destroy virus do. lot studies posted thread say opposite. seems much air moment Yes, 99% COVID deaths unvaccinated people. 

But people need medical emergencies kinds things. least Dallas, people won‚Äôt able receive emergency medical treatment *anything*. religion banned outright. guess asymptomatic COVID-vaccinated-but-infected person would likely quite cavalier worried close contact, could therefore higher risk transmitting it. said, people choosing get vaccinated probably pretty cavalier well, maybe much all. Anyone else finding increasingly difficult follow logic?

- local groups want mask mandate

- state bans mask mandate

- judge bans mask mandate ban friend absolutely shamed. would people would get vaccine. know downvoted, legitimate question.

There least two states keep track this, examine Delta breakthrough rate (not breakthrough rate since January, relevant want know Delta);

For VA, scroll chart run mouse dates July -- seems like around 10%? (Note back-populate chart weekly disease onset date, recent days usable): Indiana, scroll graph look dates July, caveat ignoring recent dates rolling average -- looks like around ~20%? (click Breakthrough top right page load)

This consistent LA county reporting 20% well recently.

*edit, sorry, see asked vaccinated get sick, vaccinated. websites numbers (looking hospitalization death), impossible break Delta. study aware measured anything symptoms Delta + Pfizer (scroll tables way end): fashion industry hit hard Covid, pants industry cratered due Zoom meetings, cutting profits half. modeling used much days data analysis models seeking new lines work. country's seven-day moving average 945 new cases reported daily (July 30-Aug. 5) showed increase 48 percent previous week.

So roughly doubling every two weeks? seeing bad areas Delta variant currently accounts majority new COVID-19 cases Canada, according Public Health Agency Canada (PHAC).

Yup. I'd interested see correlation drop flu related illness comparison average number people getting vaccine. I'm willing bet correlation actually know flu, general, also dropped far impact us all. said, I'd surprised average amount people getting vaccinated dropped data seems support fact vaccines work. likely getting similar situation flu vaccine well covid amount people seeking become vaccinated dropped due efficacy vaccine itself. educated hypothesis based basic knowledge. 

At rate. point I'd surprised find people vaccines. Vaccines politicized much. hive mind mentality Trumps following mean voters upper eslchelon vaccinated right along man himself. life me, I'll never peoples brains melt gymnastics. truly amazing. Yes. learn implant device head automatically provides proper point view. system punishment shame hoping brains operate specific way inefficient. short circuit feed info heads? set societal goal.   Mass psychosis.  Jim Jones style. Seriously--I see Abbot banning allowing hospitals listing COVID cause death. article says allow artists require vaccines. Doesn‚Äôt mean artists actually require them. go volunteer pick slack covid wards. totally safe since concerns hysteria.   *Just like Straaaaaains Floooooo-Ri-Daaaaaaaaa...* Exactly this. Ron's agenda behind letting public schools mask mandates.  That's me. got J&amp;J. Bizarre posted 3 days ago guess mod hid it?

Anyway, takeaway got 3 deer...in incredibly small sample...testing pos ab January 2020, means circulating US deer first pos human case found US. bet? variant recent years attributed flu without pos flu test result. test identified reached critical mass Wuhan people took note realized something different needed ID'd.

I wish blood samples test deer in, say, Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi 2015 forward. Go look Week 8 ILI maps period time see why.

But inertia strong 1.5 years pointing finger Wuhan 2019, that's going hard overcome.  mean I‚Äôd fine too, going happen, would happened now.

Despite things actually ‚Äúinfrastructure‚Äù bill, I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs nothing like ‚Äúinfrastructure‚Äù bill‚Ä¶ we‚Äôre gonna expect everyone prove sobriety every time turn car on.. I'm sure there's studies formal reports, difference stark almost unnecessary. Every time I've seen covered TV news, doctors nurses saying close 100% hospitalized unvaccinated, 100% ICU.  hope stays way, new variants able evade vaccine.   Total irrelevant at-will employment let fire employees illegal reasons. 

Like...you guessed it....religion. good news, cases Nevada [are starting Vegas one first places get hit Delta, trend continues, hit peak coming now. We'll see hard hit areas follow soon.

Right US, around 2% people test positive covid go die covid. two factors ten. hospitals full, deaths go up, Florida may we'll that. vaccines perfect, would prefer able shop businesses serve vaccinated people order reduce risk infection. think that's pretty reasonable preference have, even though vaccines ""100% cease transmission,"" still reduce risk infection significantly avoiding around unvaccinated people indoor spaces. reduction risk also compound reduce chance infect others.

I expect lot businesses choose cater preference, ""vaccine passes"" make easier less fraud-prone (compared e.g. manually checking vaccine cards), probably good thing someone create passes.

Yes me. I'm skeptical vaccine one reason, multiple them. one protect longest least side effects reason really wanting one right now.

That said get first round recently hopefully Moderna way go first Frank Lundy, right poller

Are talking human piece garbage Frank Luntz? curious feel younger kids able yo get vaccinated? current understanding vaccinated people still get spread covid although I'm unclear compares spread unvaccinated people. sound bad kids can't get vaccinated? I'm seeing kids suffering covid lately.

Also, everyone vaccinated covid still spreading... likely long vaccine resistant variant rolls along? put us back square one?

Last least... (assuming covid mutate vaccine resistant) everyone world ends vaccinated covid continues spread, accept small percentage population die year similar flu? minister Brad Hazard seems thrown towel, looks like going up. keep spreading states. crystal ball psychic certainly best time cases rising Canada still communities low vaccination levels.   totally agree you.

So yes, *Jacobson* says states mandate vaccine. However, merely saying state WANTS mandate vaccine absolute Police Power state. mean states mandate vaccine - Southern state residents like kind SOL perspective challenging individual states decided mandate vaccine.

However, there's another interesting SCOTUS case 1922 called *Zucht v. King* relied holding *Jacobson.* case likely also become relevant soon held school districts COULD deny admission unvaccinated students. Again, live idiotic state like mine school district would require that, school district across country wanted mandate vaccines students deny admission, solid leg stand on! 

Finally, want close pointing something ironic. Texas federal court case covid lockdowns relied *Jacobson v.

Pretty sure it‚Äôs still charity shop donated after. vaccine works immunes mean can't pass on. actively making people sick right now. reservoir species would always become endemic.

Sweden bounced back, UK still far go. Never said was. pointing extra apply emergency use Europe, even though option exists like US. went straight full approval confident vaccine. cut friend told would stop speaking ever got jabs. I'm glad got vaccine shots, listen delirious speeches know that, that's interesting. link article spells out? Also, supply still issue US?  can't believe often remind people wearing mask stop catching covid. stop spreading covid.

People wearing masks catching covid people wearing masks. completely sucks - brass balls right!  find vaccine religion intubated placed ventilator. late. Yeah Type 1 something prevent, Type 2 is. One misfortune, result bad choices.

Considering can‚Äôt even feed entire population I‚Äôd take news grain salt‚Ä¶ friend age (mid twenties) got infected March 2020 sick five weeks whole deal, including breathing issues. thanks, I'd encourage everyone get vaccine, thankfully everyone know did.

My issue people refusing vaccine many hospital beds available. taken unvaccinated people can't get medical attention need, example accident. Literally people came ""strategy"" admitted failure. 

In end comparable better death results long term similar countries, economic number quote flawed, countries different economic positions pre pandemic, also suffered pandemic different ways (heavy tourism nations hit worst).


Just show flawed economic angle argument is, country HIGHEST predicted GDP growth EU 2021, mean good economic strategy (our politicians idiots) lax COVID rules (we went full lockdown). happened booming pre pandemic went back (we also rely much tourism). may small number statistics extent. NSW 84 deaths, 2 deaths part last outbreak, 28 deaths associated it.

So, yes, tad odd first 56 deaths one 40 die, last 28 2, alone may proof.

Though nationally, also case 2 last 28 deaths 40 nationally, previous 910 deaths, 3 age 40. reason concern, I'm skeptical solid conclusions could drawn.  us already infected there's little reason get shot. Wish job would see way, going mandated shortly. buy Gwyneths perfume, get 2nd hand smell Anistons lady garden. Wish would people certain age one fell swoop this.  Sorry hear it‚Äôs right move. don‚Äôt accept people thinking another way

That's different way saying wrong. leave bait guys proved right

There's trolling convince people wrong facts using otherwise compelling sounding arguments. relatively pretty difficult pull off. there's trolling act like idiot, people bite, say ""hah-hah, pretending idiot"", that's incredibly stupid. 

But you... intellectual equivalent someone making everyone smell shit covered finger.  wrong need give citings it‚Äôs wrong, else come jerk believe feel like meaning you‚Äôre saying not, like all, fuck read believe that‚Ä¶ He's original article translated hasn‚Äôt. Sweden comparable Denmark Norway. True, song name. remember correctly Rembrandts sort upset fact famous song. ironic know people started listening would never known band without show. always taken years approve vaccines, think super ordinary. fast give emergency approval, intents purposes that's fine, except comes mandating vaccines.

Then again, Australia waited regulators give full approval instead emergency months ago, like everyone's operating emergency approvals. find either article linked says infection induced immunity better vaccine induced immunity claimed.

Additionally read abstract, says

Specifically, antibodies elicited mRNA vaccine focused RBD compared antibodies elicited infection, often targeted portions spike protein. Importantly, vaccine-elicited antibodies targeted broader range places RBD elicited natural infection. findings suggest natural immunity vaccine-generated immunity SARS-CoV-2 differ recognize new viral variants. What‚Äôs more, antibodies acquired help vaccine may likely target new SARS-CoV-2 variants potently, even variants carry new mutations RBD.  kind magical thing horse hoo-ha \*insert joke big factor anti-Gwyneth\*  Agreed push come shove choice.  plan wait FDA approval force issue. Plus question asked political debate FFS. Accusing somebody politicising topic answering question asked stupid.  Slim none. economy recovering, state/business wants go back lockdown hell, considering sloppy half hearted lockdowns generally like putting band-aid bullet hole. I‚Äôll never understand... trust doctor deliver baby, treat cancer, perform surgery. someone morons calculate vaccines it‚Äôs huge plan kill you... Eradication isn‚Äôt option doesn‚Äôt spread like smallpox, example. isn‚Äôt even argument. Anyone thinks eradication option delusional. again, lot delusion days. 

Most people aren‚Äôt vaccinated people colour minorities, undocumented etc. Many people aren‚Äôt position order online sit car. one example without getting minutia segregation.   highschool education less actually seen largest decrease vaccine hesitancy recently. vaccine hesitant group PhD's. Definitely people would assume. Al Qaeda? Tye US trained funded islamic extremists there. think reason seeing states ""spared"" Delta atm they've got good vaccine protection. Delta everywhere point I'd imagine. state CT we've definitely Delta fueled rise cases, increase positivity going 0.75% 3.5%. big move up, compared carnage FL seems like nothing.

I believe saw we've got 80% adults CT least one shot. little bit keep half-assing giving tens hundreds millions attempts mutate every time around? Yes, odds worryingly high mutate again.

That major reason many us wanted clamp hard got control.... vaccinate everyone fast.

This half-ass activity comparable constantly eating half antibiotics given you. shit negative side effects.  graphic fellow redditor linked shows real numbers. Masks work best everyone wearing them. Using example above's numbers, everyone masked turns 20 hours. 3 minutes one wearing one, hour are, 20 hours everyone is. Anti-maskers ignore cumulative effect everyone masks, individual level much whole greater sum parts. multiplier effect. qualms happening lol   Oops sorry thanks hated Jesus cause tells truth. Wait, Taliban part CIA plan beat Russia invaded Afghanistan? CIA mauled lions retroactively. would deport citizens !? would them. educated dealt internally. Republicans fine passing laws clearly unconstitutional, fact prefer that. way look like something without actually it, blame 'liberal courts' foiling plans.

So look like 'did right thing', activated base vote President would nominate judges side. sell stuff ignorant meat head discount, say easy excuse whenever gets called out? true? Jaime look could, vaccine development lot faster mRNA. America least (""lucky"" enough several mega-pharma corps) expect able mass produce annual shot protect latest variant. That's reality endemic COVID.

The real problem people even acknowledge existence/value people bare minimum first masking vaxing impossible see avoid apocalyptic levels global warming decades come. I've watching Brisbane, Australia, I'm horrified Texas Florida. 

We positive case turn high school last week. MASSIVE testing mask wearing response later, several schools closed, city lockdown (mostly adhered to), new cases associated initial outbreak, infectious quarantine period. We'll done time, back normal. 

I've got baby home. can't imagine terrified I'd situation. family member mine caught twice died second time Even though walked back, recently CDC said vaccinated people generally longer needed masks. people daylight getting vital vitamin bodies, let's see happens winter people indoors vitamin levels low. narrative already making rounds, eg: ""It usually take 10 years get approval!"" Forget fact 4 billion people already got shots. They're going keep moving goal post. Lol didn‚Äôt Good see data J &amp; J, that's one went back April. someone young healthy, co-morbidities, flustered ""lower efficacy"" chorus weird Vaccine ""Fanboys"" love dump anything fave.

We know that; Immune This! vaccinated loved one's unable vaxxed different reasons. Would hate inadvertently spread one bc showing symptoms know. Nah. Stay fuck away me.  Sorry, much time one spend Reddit start calling birthday ‚Äúcake day‚Äù? Right. I‚Äôm immediately wary anyone says they‚Äôre patriotic dozens flags house car. often means exactly opposite. it‚Äôs category Christians broadcast religion well. killed virus imagine vaccine safe /s girlfriend getting hour me, texted like small bee sting. point worries whatsoever, like... ""A bee sting?! f-in hurt like hell!""

When actually got it, like minor scratch, barely anything normally notice. got back home, told never actually stung bee, imagined that's must feel like. \*facepalm\* every country would make requirement entry, we'd definitely cut variants spreading internationally. Eradication option people suddenly scared vaccines now. I'd like hear curbside pickup damn unreasonable you. Maybe let immunocompromised people choose living like prisoners risking lives much challenge sit car someone deliver groceries you. completely preventable two pricks needle makes appalling. Money vs health child... brainer. No. think vaccine mandates going come full force.

I think lockdowns happen hospitals completely collapse. Texas Florida getting there.  Dream on.

We tried Netherlands. Tests enough. Rapid antigen test definitely enough. 0.6% (from pandemic) puts Sweden front pack European terms,‚Äù David Oxley, economist Capital Economics, told Reuters.

Not shabby. lot hate towards Swedish strategy (no lockdown, mask) sub year ago. see Sweden fared pretty well comparison (so far). ranked #39 deaths per capita based official statistics worldometers #49 based excess deaths according economist. read, long ago, previous infections SARS/MERS might give immunity. know, I'm adding comment :) better zero.  opinion   anecdotal. Nearly half Republicans vaxed. much larger 21% Democrats, narrative conservatives anti-vax anti-covid simply wrong. They're business make money least...  flip interesting part whole fiasco. recall, big chunk people anti-mask, anti-distance, anti-quarantine, anti-anything since make difference anyway. vaccine hail-Mary, endgame, solution.

Then vaccine came and... nope. want vaccine. want big government telling do! (Pouty face / foot stomp)

wth happened along path? sure Phoebe, first thought episode believe evolution, like said. Can't believe even question! phone God's ears!!!!  Sure. 96% efficacy hospitalization 100%.

If ~5% people previously hospitalized (which right), 0.2% hospitalized now, 1 500.

Those pretty good odds. Nice. Good idea. I‚Äôm kind glad kid brought home colds school. also H1N1. Maybe unexpected ROI‚Ä¶ also explains low IgA IgB titers post covid. don‚Äôt recall covid immunity test market measured cells. It‚Äôs heartbreaking many people put much effort try slow spread flood gates opening right 51% Republicans vaccinated, 23% Democrats either. 

Your narrow mindedness toward conservatives wrong. 

Source: Kaiser Permanente Yeah, we're probably 3 weeks FDA approval, we're going watch change tune like whiplash  Well test things don‚Äôt they? saying tests faulty? someone lying something?

Anecdotal two friends nurses Children‚Äôs Hospital San Diego told rise RSV cases weeks ago. 

So would argue ripping communities covid control health infrastructure isn‚Äôt taxed. 

This important people take covid precautions seriously. It‚Äôs covid cases, it‚Äôs whole healthcare infrastructure. Abbott wuss? really wonder mandated vaccinations affect teaching population. lot teachers left profession last year, I'm sure schools could afford lose more. 

(That said, I'm still mandates.) it? Why? think health workers ""conspiracy theorists"" Germany compared normal people? I'm snarky? Reread comments. Yeas, saw current photos well. According article, Jordyn receiving treatment Arkansas Children's Hospital obesity several years.  Imagine many plans going grounded Karens flipping ""freedoms."" believe vaccines fetal cells.

I'd love share info rare I'm trying give much info data track identity. Let's say qualified almost everything.

It's funny think, might actually know other. actually good number people aren‚Äôt getting shots emergency authorization. Full approval help fence, business mandating employees get vaccinated move even people. don‚Äôt want lose health insurance pandemic, all. speculation scientists. idea COVID might evolve. SAGE group modelling consistently pessimistic - extremely useful planning medium-to-worst-case scenarios, much less comes media coverage obviously.

When comes speculation own. 1918 flu mutate exactly way, going 0.5% CFR first wave 10-20% second - idea definitely based reality. hand VOC's we've seen conjectured happen extended evolution sars-cov-2 within single immunocompromised long-term host, evolution would cut host died. also studies showing covid jumping different species (the deer ""study"" NYC sewage data), also lead large levels mutation.  right, he's cut great republican POTUS got J&amp;J two weeks ago want get mRNA top up. anyone sources long wait? 

I've done plenty research can't find actual timeframes. tried calling [hospital San offering top get anyone info I'll sure important things doing. help appreciated. That's think they're though Every production set post house I‚Äôve point requires verifies vaccine, maybe entertainment industry fools.


This like construction workers claiming don‚Äôt believe hard hats. significant full approval vaccines? mean we‚Äôd global supplies possibly put end pandemic? Yes, knows golf course real killer lurking in! OJ continues search. purpose :/ Purely anecdotal, I've read, there's reason can't. Worst case scenario change, best case scenario help. really research instead parroting shit happily spoon fed feel right.

Delta infecting Vaccinated decent rate. Much higher flu.

Delta shedding VIRAL LOAD vaccinated unvaccinated induvial. means vaccinated individual covid likely spread unvaccinated. r6 right now. 

Put mask back on. Vaccine mean shit personal protection. better people vaccinated. thinking harmful anti-vaxxers point. That‚Äôs life. understand people premanently comparing shots equal footing. like Europe randomly putting third fourth shots arms healthy 30-year-olds. Booster shots targeted policy aimed old grave underlying health issues, well at-risk health personel. also happen groups whose second vaccinations happening roughly 4-6 months ago. planning thrid shot groups selfishness, medically neccessary step. read three times brain accepting eyes seeing. thought misread first. scrolled down, worse got. poor girl failed many ways. obvious swelling floating kneecap, forget hernia specifically, required surgery. MRI later revealed long-term damage knee required ongoing treatment could avoided. He‚Äôs also since sued multiple people malpractice longer practicing medicine. Yep, we'll see, trust want get back normal, think happen anytime soon. American health shitter. You‚Äôre right, type 2 chronic avoidable.  Death rate .01%. that's infected children. actual number kids dying year probably around 200-400. high end, that's .0005% chance dying. 

They're 10 times likely get murdered 30 times die accident. focus following science consider actual risk.  Yes, sad.

One hope Biden administration something Putin's internet warfare. imagine that's something hold press conference about.  hear you, think researchers also finding evidence Delta yields severe disease.

One thing check -- virus simply infecting people before, could alone explain rising ICU numbers? UK hospitalization/deaths curves still far ithe used number cases (but still rising :-() Sudden death, poor thing totally vulnerable company needs care OSHA lost time incidents. Vaccine reactions (even day two feeling sick common) mandated become reportable lost time events earlier year vaccine required employment. impact insurance rates well ability continue working field *at all* industries lost time incidents frequent, might 30% staff suddenly days worth incidents mandatory vaccine reactions... relative teacher vaccinated. breaks heart it‚Äôs contradiction don‚Äôt know live with. mom died last year father well ‚Äúdanger zone‚Äù virus. don‚Äôt know epidemiological standpoint, variants never ending cycle doctor‚Äôs eyes, there‚Äôs probably never gonna ‚Äúright time‚Äù lift mask mandate.

It might seem reactionary counterproductive aspects, public simply ‚Äúbetter safe sorry‚Äù approach US. seems places hit delta already head extremely steep rise fall. Malta, Barcelona, India, UK name places. Factor good vaccination rate going quickly run large vulnerable populations. 

The data south starting indicate turn already there. expect see decline US south sooner rather later. growth rate slowed good indicator cases declining soon. Keep eye Miami Dade county Florida.

I‚Äôm one jump conclusions say Romania flat reporting numbers inaccurately, mere observation absurd say least. what. One shot mRNA vaccines good 1 shot JJ. Amen! hear coming from, lemme try clarify perspective; % deaths enough info.

Consider two extreme situations see 80% deaths among obese:

In McDonaldsville, 99% population obese, 80% CoViD deaths among obese.

In Carrotsville, 1% population obese, full 80% CoViD deaths among obese.

&amp;#x200B;

In McDonaldsville, we'd see obese deaths obese population 80/99, thus almost 20% safer obese McDonaldsville CoViD hit.

In Carrotsville, we'd see obese deaths obese population 80/1, thus 80 times likely obese person Carrotsville would die CoViD hit.

&amp;#x200B;

20/60 get deaths covid among non-obese non-obese section population. ... 1/3... meaning non-obese under-represented overall, factor three.

About 80/40 get deaths covid among obese obese section population... 2... meaning obese over-represented overall, factor two... value used previous statement; perhaps case could made makes sense say obese folk 6 times likely die compared non-obese people... either way, remains far 1,000s-fold larger correlation age, infinite correlation infection. No. "" Severe COVID-19 illnesses sending unvaccinated pregnant women younger people local ICUs, doctors Ascension Seton Medical Center Austin warned Friday.

During Facebook Live event, Dr. Jeny Ghartey, maternal medical director, said she‚Äôs seeing alarming rate unvaccinated pregnant women severe COVID illness. Pregnant women COVID-19 likely admitted ICU need invasive machinery help breathe, said. They're also likely die compared nonpregnant women.

‚ÄúIt hard see unvaccinated patients general, especially young, otherwise healthy pregnant women come incredibly sick,‚Äù said Ghartey, treats women high-risk pregnancies. ‚ÄúAnd need immediately placed ventilator [extracorporeal membrane oxygenation].‚Äù

Dr. John David Hinze, chief endoscopic lung surgery pulmonary critical care specialist, uses device ICU. said ECMO draws blood person, sends artificial heart lung, pumps back person rewarmed state. process removes carbon dioxide adds oxygen, giving patient's lungs time rest. buys time.
Hinze said device helped two people ICU last week ‚Äì woman 20s girl teens. But, said, aren‚Äôt enough ECMO machines everybody.

‚ÄúIn fact, circuits limited we‚Äôre really going offer young pregnant females save two lives instead one,‚Äù Hinze said. ‚ÄúWe going offer 35-year-old male. sad that? we‚Äôre make kinds ethical decisions.‚Äù

Hinze said virus affecting younger people, including otherwise healthy teenagers. age range patients Ascension Seton's ICU currently 19 74.

Both doctors emphasized importance safety COVID-19 vaccines.

**Ghartey said pregnant women weren‚Äôt included initial clinical trials, data 35,000 women registered information Centers Disease Control Prevention. said data shows getting vaccine doesn‚Äôt change risk pre-term birth congenital abnormalities fetus. said also evidence support myths vaccines could affect placenta fertility men women.**

Which extremely bizarre would number new deaths *higher,* x4 number new cases??? Nearly peak last winter now. Texas Medical Center Houston largest world, 2nd  Here's thing. virus level data based number cycles required detect virus PCR tests, significant source bias. 

People vaccinated reason get tested unless feel bad. So, we're basically saying people feel bad similar virus levels regardless whether vaccinated. We're saying people day 5 day 8, etc infection similar virus levels regardless vaccination status. I‚Äôve heard implied even care think about.  Wow, terrible generalization Joe Rogan nothing like that.

Now excuse must consume hourly dose BrainForce(TM) Oh no, noticed NH; went 41 90 cases overnight. Ok give every American 50k stay home isolate? You‚Äôre also hospital ventilator teenager.

I‚Äôm pretty sure point, especially since family asking people pray, rather vaccinated. draw conclusion that's outdoor contagion.

Many people reported tents 'sweaty humid', might technically outdoors, that's still indoor condition. know feeling, packed nightclubs, slippery floors, wet walls, create thing closed tent. Everyone thought 19th July, restrictions dropped Delta rampant, would bring huge rise cases

I saying since last may looking data, people keep repeating 2 week lag times, cases tend lag anywhere 4-8 weeks depending sharp rise is, deaths typically another 2-4 weeks behind that. easing restrictions July 19 going effect seeing somewhere coming week, 1st week September. Don‚Äôt surprised numbers start coming next 2-3 weeks. Delta seems hit super hard fast. Watch India UK.... remember reading [fenofibrate effective year ago. believe [trial progress U others, I've heard MANY drugs. Let's hope true, readily available. imagine so, maybe sooner hs Makes wonder burger mask hitting 1000 posts per day thread while. Looks like surge posts nothingburger.

It‚Äôs freedom choice either sit seat stand aisle. fine‚Äù Thank getting vaccinated. Please don‚Äôt live fear. believe evolution...  honest question here:
I recently got Covid unvaccinated person, vaccinated, got sick couple days. able get better resting vitamins fluids. unvaccinated friend gave Covid able same, young healthy. symptoms definitely bad his. well, pass people even though around good amount people. heavy believer vaccines science. friend still says get vaccinated, many friends like this. keep citing studies show hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, zinc affective combating COVID-19. studies part look legitimate. However effective people still dying. rationalize effective.

I recently conversation friend people dying wishing got vaccinated. said doctors fault prescribing hydroxychloroquine find absurd.

I guess question I‚Äôm looking people actual experience ground hospitals patients treated explain happening? works one two times farther hospitals fill up...and work more. I'm sure infinite impossible scenarios could dream imagination save us though, right?

I bet everything would better three months gave everyone America 50,000 stay home. Wanna take bet?  think drawing conclusion comment never intended. Till next variant. 


Just wait, US produced new delta plus variant Ay3 competing delta virus.  
Also, Lambda next.

NY still averaging single digit deaths day despite month long uptick  vaccine better vaccine! push mRNA one, try to, J&amp;J waaay better vaccine J&amp;J pre-fusion stabilized form spike protein sequence mRNA vaccines use AZ wildtype, though, think six one, half dozen other. way slice damn impressive vaccines rolled quickly. Really impressive pure technology perspective. believe takes J&amp;J month efficacy build anyway might well go one mRNA shots higher overall protection. Although there‚Äôs concerns friend might go back second shot J&amp;J might make sense. No, strict mask policy pandemic. policy unvaccinated workers wear mask. changed back everyone wear mask.  good proxy seeing herd immunity. Nah, I‚Äôm able imagine disturbed enough attitude many. said, appreciate people cause couldn‚Äôt it, much know. Bye felicia don‚Äôt care 400 children died preventable deaths new variant effects even more.  EUA 5-11 September

Didn't get pushed back due FDA wanting larger testing group? I'm despairing 10 year old. ok filling every emergency room point overflows regular rooms causing people non-preventable emergencies receiving care?

You ok people sucking oxygen weeks slowly die recover permanent lung brain damage? SHUT SAY.  It‚Äôs pretty much Christian domestic anti-vaccines terrorism.  Religion disease good news, people 65, one dose doesn‚Äôt seem protective two doses, data delta, likely made things worse. multistate network U.S. hospitals January‚ÄìMarch 2021, receipt Pfizer-BioNTech Moderna COVID-19 vaccines 94% effective COVID-19 hospitalization among fully vaccinated adults 64% effective among partially vaccinated adults aged ‚â•65 actually sick? much return normal. Really fucking dumb  Morality relative. Since powerful actors make moral declarations, power doesn‚Äôt corrupt. enforces. entity incapable enforcing morality really isn‚Äôt powerful. Jesus, attitude worst getting old. mad wrong person. guy everything right deserves live life now. Go mad anti-vaxxer... know, someone ACTUALLY problem. don‚Äôt see difference? Lol. first ever vector-based vaccine approved 2019. mean that's exactly vaccines work?

Are talking mandated vaccines going public schools? that, school mandatory. someone wants kid unvaccinated homeschool. also support mandates vaccines healthcare workers, putting patients risk.

Are situations vaccines mandatory?
Do worry might done bad administration precedent mandates? honestly confused conservatives actually agree government ban masks cannot required. traditional conservative one biggest foundations smaller government giving autonomy locally elected officials make calls. OK state governing body put big government restrictions locales? even make sense, hell happened republican party whatever hell crap is, ain't it. numbers directly CDC.

58.2% total population received one dose, 50%. 15.3% population prior infection vaccination, approximately 50 million people (not 20 30m).

If take account go back second dose actual number received least one dose 60.7% (**75.1% add unvaccinated prior infection**). getting source? watching Fauci mentioned fully vaxxed person gets covid almost amount viral load nasopharynx  Traditional since 2019! 'Murica: hold beer... get point trying make, think simple.

AIDS drastically different virus coronaviurs. already 'headstart' due similarity previous coronaviruses.

Also, live world HIV/AIDS research come long, long way, treatments way better, there's still vaccine sight. necessarily think we'd one sooner. getting shot waving flag. Everything else fighting.  Besides, whole milk tastes much better. Even kid loved drinking milk still drink gallon 2 3 days time. Good habits started young, stay whole life. Christ would travel kids vaccinated even table adult dose. Wish knew place it. poop driveways delivery? sold out. state continue high, free testing. creator ain‚Äôt mortal human. Look beyond earthly realm. It‚Äôs blinding lie. We're going get variants either way, low vaccination rates worldwide. That's happiest! finally prove didnt need get ""doesnt even work"" amazing lengths people go ride lie  like they've convinced true.  recent cases resulting severe illness death could largely prevented people gotten inoculated.

And they‚Äôd worn masks avoided indoor gatherings, would rest deaths avoided? says he‚Äôs since vaccines, clearly it‚Äôs hurting much.

That doesn‚Äôt make sense. ‚ÄúBefore vaccine, banning vaccinated riders didn‚Äôt reduce ridership‚Äù. 

Well, yeah. wouldn‚Äôt see decrease banned Venusians, either. talking different vaccines. Chinese vaccine used Peru US vaccines. Government officials like De Santiz MTG arrested spreading misinformation endangering lives millions people. Get cross, Jesus‚Ä¶  someone breakdown numbers me? 

What 91% 96.2% protection death mean? 

* compared unvaccinated individuals? 
* say population 10,000 get covid, 200 die (2% mortality rate), mean J&amp;J shot recipeients? d
* mean see 8-18 10,000 die (91-96.2% reduction death compared above). 
* number even lower?  

Same question regarding 71% protection hospitilizaition? 

* mean population 10,000 - say 20% become hospitalized - 2,000 people. 
* 71% protection mean 580 get hospitalized? 

How numbers compare Pfizer &amp; Moderna numbers? sanctions? covid infections know personally due kids &amp; school. good luck that..  Buddy make website called AmericaNationalNews.com sell ads too. 

Doesn't give credibility like guardian, Al Jazeera etc, know, actual companies reporters fact checking. quote responded literally says, since pandemic began Win-win I'm willing bet referring whole pandemic thing... see reply anything counter fact TRUMP VACINNE MADE MASS PRODUCED WORLD, CHILD. Trusted leader tells everyone part.  epidemiological standpoint, variants never ending cycle doctor‚Äôs eyes, there‚Äôs probably never gonna ‚Äúright time‚Äù lift mask mandate.

I feel like places gonna lift mandate Delta cases manageable level, re-evaluate there‚Äôs another variant gets control. 

It might seem reactionary counterproductive aspects, public simply ‚Äúbetter safe sorry‚Äù approach US.  unfortunately documentation gonna get exemption. Oh Jesus Christ, absurd fearmongering  surge probably worse ago fucking nobody distancing masking. Idaho 10x many cases would single day month ago. US: Hold beer. Agree, vaccines (we do) potentially boosters designed variants (we'll think), next hit treatments (hopefully few) lucky enough end bad covid even vaccinated, manageable, looks like still need cautious ""normality"" still affected. Fingers crossed good treatments soon üò©  fact thing thats really keeping getting vaccine hard they're pushing neighbors friends turn something thats really none business got vaccinated not. Exactly. vax rate Lollards sturgis probably opposites  Telling people small (and due vaccines, vanishing) risk literally fear mongering.

I'm telling anyone off. anyone you. I'm showing risk child death COVID versus chance winning Powerball. That's telling anyone comparing relative risk disease comparing something people understand rare event people actually win. Saying zero risk completely false zero, there's zero chance anyone wins Powerball also know false.

I mean actually take real numbers child deaths, 1000 times likely child die win Powerball. scary news headlines Delta past 2-3 weeks seem scaring decent amount vaccine fence-sitters getting shot, could change soon. Fun fact sure one cares about. sorority system chapter created chapter named order first chapter Alpha, beta etc. Similarly within chapter class given name order. could Pi Beta Phi sorority, delta gamma chapter part epsilon beta class.  headline, entire narrative üòè Man I‚Äôm fucking tired this. Even though I‚Äôm worried catching getting severe case, still parents 60s still risk even they‚Äôre vaccinated. want stop worrying them. Ugh. Hopefully announce booster shots soon.  Government mandates actually exactly vaccines work.

This ""new""

Not difference EUA full approval mean anything relevant. Formally would mean doctor could proscribe vaccine off-label something else, but...why would want to? went private lab paid $200 PCR. Sucked- peace mind worth it. RSV big Broward right (respiratory virus) makes extra complicated.  lol good riddence Disagreed. Completely. 

Make life absolutely miserable get vaccinated. 

""Well, OK. We're looking accomplish this. know cannot force get vaccine. Still, want facility potentially causing problems. So, we've decided we're going go separate equal policy. So, starting today, we're moving antivax people new ""offices"" - three shipping containers back. desks there. phones &amp; computers there. They're wired electricity. We'll get air conditioning eventually, I'm sure........""  they‚Äôll catch bunch poo particles! Around July 4th holiday There's going new variant every several months years. promising US. going achieve vaccination rate, population also higher dumber. think successful outcome here. Wait? Easter yet? anyone take pictures closed ERs post social media prove virus real yet? number officers quit retire early forced get COVID-19 vaccine.

As lovely big bois already high risk dying covid.    cults heed warning 100,000 die per day. Even enough idiots keep pandemic going another year. facetious I‚Äôve already vaxxed, don‚Äôt attack asking question. 

My understanding we‚Äôre pushing vaccines we‚Äôre worried another variant mutating bodies. 

But since vaccinated people still catch COVID, virus unable mutate bodies? fact mutate bodies vaccinated, worried getting everyone shot?

I‚Äôm anti vaxxer, I‚Äôm looking someone smarter answer this. wanna facetious condescending, don‚Äôt bother. There's decent chunk people getting second dose unfortunately. Like 10-15 million. 

There's also small number 3rd doses first dose . booster shot J&amp;j mRNA. idea numbers tho you‚Äôre salty disillusionment sullenly nitpick headline article say natural stronger, see hope mandates happen, make lives miserable possible. No, guy might one dumbest people earth You‚Äôre still free get vaccine. Nobody going come house, tie up, forcibly inject you. won‚Äôt get benefits living society don‚Äôt bare minimum help keep society functioning, like access public services lots private businesses.

*That‚Äôs* freedom is. It‚Äôs freedom want deal consequences actions, whatever want suffer consequences it.   Hopefully even allowed airport without fully vaxxed. TSA would finally something useful do. I've spent career around software development well, I'm familiar phenomenon. Like I'll step away topic rant paragraphs this. think that's seeing here. universal agreement following best practices. use software analogy like seeing software engineers agreeing idea deploy code production without testing first.  problem!  Long expect whole lot f you's Yeah I've saying long time Covid deadly enough visible enough scare populace compliance.

If everyone caught got pustules warts, looked like firefighters Chernobyl, simply killed higher % hosts, people would it.   I'm fully vaccinated enjoying summer. see reason based data efficacy vaccines. I'm tired variant fear mongering good news 80% 65+ fully vaccinated antigenic Likelihood: Almost certain. Impact: Medium.

So everything ‚Äòrealistic possibility.‚Äô sure would bother postulating unrealistic possibilities.  Yeah talk another comment, hunch 1.5x 2x cases last November, due asymptomatic (vaccines) less testing see 100k day.

Good part ? burn fast.

Hopefully least. Funny posting something randomly works... someone else might see maybe helped people thought. I'm going recommend family members... might multiply! Thanks friend! think framed standpoint number children hospitals two weeks, people would comply. would better try fire wait burn endless fuel. look Sisonke, actual study read. thing found news reports study. Jacobson v Mass literally based Jacobson‚Äôs belief Preamble protected mandatory vaccination ( case smallpox ). Supreme Court shot down.

Hey, I‚Äôll admit I‚Äôm pretty afraid needles especially near skin. sane human look away, makes way bearable. 

There‚Äôs far scarier things life needles. Like global pandemic misinformation fucked lives many lmao. Yes are.

There 25 students class. space requirements students. Masks required vaccinations kids 12 required. Kids 12 vaccinated. 

I see high chance back school plan failing completely. Politicians listening experts, instead wanting get parent's votes. get parents want kids back school feel premature even late date. anti-vaxers cheering plan on. sorry kids die, get sick hospitalized.   Yes like darwinism strong develop antibodies weak die leading herd immunity. How?! Vikings manage f*cking embarrassment MN even season?! Minnesota sports fan unyielding cavalcade heartache bitter disappointment already, doesn‚Äôt need help Kirk ignorant moron. vaccinated people transmit, infected greatly reduced vaccine. unvaccinated going get infected. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want look like crazy anti-vaxxer co-workers,‚Äù said.

But... are. going brutal. Delta whole new beast. theyre math entirely wrong. They're calculations 20% vaccinated individuals got Covid, 20% infected vaccinated. 6 deaths vaccinated average age 77 Springfield MO two hospitals longest Delta outbreak country. two months. One hospital close 30 die last week unvaccinated believe.

All vaccinated deaths also underlying conditions.

It unvaccinated dying would say 97-98% time. high percentage Ohh noo might mandate boosters?? think would scare someone who‚Äôs ok vaccine getting mandated lol. 

What bothers people selfishly going around killing people. Get vaccinated. agree Kirk.

*if get reference friends. live country close USA, I'm hyped new States planning require foreign travelers. Lots antivax locals suddenly clambering vaccines. health friends family small tightly entwined community, precious shopping trips states. Whatever takes. welcome think that, actually unreasonable. stupid idea begin didnt surge *6* months?

We decline early April 2020 mid June 2020 (3 months) surge.

We 3 month decline plateau mid-July 2020 mid-October 2020 (just 3 months) surge. 

Then decline early-Jan end March (3 months) surge.

And decline mid-April - early July (3 months) surge. Yay! Can't wait.     Thank Stanlot. I‚Äôve asking people question 3 months you‚Äôre first person give scientific explanation Less 1 million ppl aren‚Äôt eligible. need stay home. 100 million unvaccinated eligible subject Darwinism.  Good. Yes wife nurse every loss hits hard.

I sell shoes living, tell lot Hey Dudes summer shoes 

Be well realize comparing one bad thing another thing doesnt make first bad thing mean less? even point? Right. artists going call shots this. story says they're letting artists tour determine it, basically. Live nation produces tours pays artists essentially. interpretation according Catholic Church basically something like...

""If Catholic charitable thing vaccinate prevent suffering world. Yes, includes even J&amp;J ties stem cell research. cannot vaccinate, duty social distance mask necessary.""

But Trads (Traditional Radical Catholics, are..... uh... extreme) refuse follow authority Vatican whatever. thread Fauci vaccine mandates United States. would talking European rules? guy desperate win recall. Politics aside, getting people vaccinated clearly right thing do. deployed many chopped onions border food pyramid. seriously doubt idiots follow that. San Francisco probably highest starting police pay country, $92,000 year. 7 years, make $140,000 excellent benefits.

No cop throwing away vaccine. can't understand it.

A cold lasts days. Flu kicks ass week. Long Covid lasts least months, people year already.

24 hours nothing compared above. That's nap hangover. Except haven‚Äôt. Deaths America increasing day weeks. daily dead around 500 day +88% increase past 14 days.

Hospitals starting get overran. Texas ERs shutting redirect staff COVID patient care. 11 month old baby air lifted another hospital 150 miles away cause pediatric beds left Houston area.

We soon back 9-11 day deaths hospitals overran. 

The way get back normal force vaccinations work public space mask mandates high enough percentage population vaccinated. gets FDA mandated change Washington Post report, Vikings lowest vaccination rate NFL team, 65% players fully vaccinated. Recently, Zimmer team management urged players get vaccinated, especially highly-contagious Delta variant spreads Minnesota across country.  google says lethal dose graphene 2 grams kg, assuming normal sized human lethal dose would quarter pound, unless injecting whole case sister problem.

louisiana data showing vaccines stop 95% cases yeah, definitely still get delta odds better vaccine

it would nice links everything peer reviewed studies, i'm sure that's much ask  mom RN works elective surgery sector. Last year stopped elective surgeries **sent home**. wasn‚Äôt transferred ICU ER, literally furloughed nurses, major city too. situation bad, would literally take nurses schedule? forgive ‚Äúthey stopped elective surgeries‚Äù doesn‚Äôt worry me

And you‚Äôll need specific Mississippi nearly ICU beds filled up. ICU already operating near full capacity anyways  Vaccinated people still catch viral load experience far less someone infected unvaccinated they'll able fight infection faster. vaccinated people get infected less severe symptoms. effective immune response means less virus less opportunity mutate.  Depends judges political even challenge them. don‚Äôt see it‚Äôs going feasible. That‚Äôs ok, Last week ‚Äúit‚Äôs flu, bro.‚Äú ‚Äúit‚Äôs over, back work!‚Äú Take pick. follow point deleted comment, I've read thousands thousands covid-related news items since pandemic began pretty sure one entire time mentioned someone's sexuality... one Provincetown event (gay) people involved reporting event, gayness played role detection/reporting event. day three pandemic fourth article morning putting gay spin crisis, sure, fair point, what's sexuality stuff got it? gay-angle entire point. even wasn't, even one gay man sharing experience covid impacted life, community, etc. would bad thing? Things impact groups differently, many reasons, can't people talk that?

You said, ""If groups homosexuals, blacks, Latinos, etc. want treated equally need act equals."" context absolutely idea means. homosexuals act unequal? Fuck rights want nurses safari gear driving Humvees around republican neighborhoods dart guns loaded J&amp;J.  Twice. Two separate people asked it. Ask OP that's referring argue it. 1% IFR extremely high novel respiratory disease idk many times said soon heard COVID-19 variants, knew would able get rid unless completely wiped face planet absolutely mercy. vaccine offered chance, fact people wasting baffling me.  almost perfect, say ""MMA vaccine"" didn‚Äôt make claim caused nationwide outbreak. also didn‚Äôt make claim outbreak resulting Sturgis one state next door. COVIMTV - Coronavirus Media Transmissible Variant symptoms include fast decline mental health, sudden onset phobia-level fear anxiety, increased dependency codependent behaviour, self-isolation. Unfortunately, cold, flu digestive symptoms alert others contact someone variant, reliable test ensure infected person pass family friends!  awful mask saw hankie draped string tied like apron. low compliance masks here, low vax rates high rate infections. back coughing allover completely unmasked work. :( Retail shoppers monsters. work alongside antivaxxer room day, caught him, took home spouse caught too.

Well, antivaxxers idiots, example shows delta capable jumping one vaccinated person another... say delta would likely spreading anyway antivaxxers not... wait school opens up. Going complete shit show  Totally agree. Even without kids, I‚Äôd iffy personally.

Right now, I‚Äôll indoor dining, know I‚Äôm going around &lt; 2 year old niece after.  safe say never reach level herd immunity? people listen lockdown mandate either. get violent.   Oh god really? source this? covid pandemic emergency highest level, killing far people one year U.S. *combined* death toll recorded hurricanes, tornados, dust storms, floods, forest fires, volcano eruptions, earthquakes U.S. history.  They'll hold financial impact unbearable, they'll say pro-vaccine whole time. Thanks dude. I'll display proudly Even it‚Äôs good cause, giving government authority forcibly inject something *really* bothers me. That‚Äôs serious totalitarian shit. 

Yeah, may harmless vaccine saves lives time, give government precedent, nefarious administration could fabricate emergency future use excuse force population take something less life-saving questionable. Nightmare scenario would like movie ‚ÄúEquilibrium.‚Äù forced sterilizations ‚Äúundesirable‚Äù populations. 

I fully support businesses telling people get vaxxed get out. *government* say ‚Äútake shot else we‚Äôll [insert punishment here],‚Äù can‚Äôt really say it‚Äôs free country. Bodily autonomy really fucking important, forced injections pretty obvious example government violating bodily autonomy. recommended videos videos reinforce belief. fine. mandate proof vaccination condition attending public school.

My old vaccine card elementary-middle school back diploma corroborates this. Also seems like conversation sorts judge convicted convicted expressed issues judge making condition parole.

Will interesting see proceeds. Growing means making independent choices take full consequences responsibilities. like people tell mommy daddy longer around. needs grow now? Lets profanity brilliant mind. Check many cases Alabama right versus three weeks ago. Deaths skyrocket levels peak. What‚Äôs everybody‚Äôs read movie theaters right now? County Northern VA, rated ‚Äúhigh‚Äù transmission. I‚Äôm fully vaccinated Moderna, since March. also virus back December/January (bled New Year, started holidays‚Äî fun). 

I know transmission levels vaccinated folks (this theater high uptake area) remains low, but, curious all‚Äôs read commit going later. fairness, PTA/PTO completely separate school's budget. pays classroom supplies, field trips, incentives (prizes), token teacher appreciation. course, we're low-income school barely bring enough cover that. sense flattening curve means decrease amount people infected first wave infections.


 people knew mean ""stay home weeks pandemic goes away"" instead meant ""stay home hospitals get immediately inundated, time figure protect figure works"" 


If lead believe staying home two weeks would make virus disappear I'm sorry mislead, may suggested varying news diet, sources read clear point. mean, yeah, right 100% free that. That's *why* there's argument increasing minimal wage. people want *change law* McDonalds pay livable wage.

In way, want *change law* prevent vaccination requirements, lobby that, right 100% legal. caps lock make seem like I'm shouting, caps lock you, sunshine. figured bigger text would make easier read.  people choose get vaccine, get sick, slowly succumb ICU, it.

Did watch video? clearly wrong attitude is, people hurt too.  Can‚Äôt wait see grown ass men women crying getting little shot. ""Fake Covid Vaccination Cards Rise U.S., Europe
Vaccine mandates fueled increase demand fraudulent certificates sellers flourish , forged vax documents make mandates less useful trustworthy  long delta panic going now?    Lots people dying. There's lower death/case ratio since many cases vaccinated people and/or younger people, still significant number deaths among unvaccinated, mostly adults. discriminating random BS people make actual common belief. encouraging mask mandates people get around needle jabs.

Also, states local governments receive federal funding, government contractors. Sure, benefit gained? Possibly crappy day vs almost imperceptible benefit. haven‚Äôt seen concrete data exact reduction risk natural immunity alone vs natural plus vaccine.

They tell God's get Covid, means weak immune system oh well die. get Covid. Amish ever Covid, even tested positive Covid, hospitals trying make money government. Masks make people sick, neighbor Ohio/PA/SD/Indiana daughter wore mask work time got sick almost died mask wearing, lost job. I've heard least 40 Amish now, locals strangers. insane. muh freedom kind don‚Äôt agree. *only* way ends broad, population level immunity. come vaccines come infections (at cost overrun hospitals death).

Masks don‚Äôt increase immunity. slow spread, protects hospitals, never long term solution. 

Why focus stopgap solution?

Don‚Äôt get wrong, think masking right makes sense, ramp vaccination parallel. No. authoritarian eyes cry babies want it. truly authoritarian, would go rights freedoms. vaccine mandate GO AGAINSY RIGHT FREEDOMS. MATTER MUCH FEEL DOES. I'm little dumb. mean vaccine back March different approved one? exact one they're trying approve? barely affecting kids

Yeah, bent backwards keeping kids home isolated, virtual schooling, hybrid schooling, strictly enforced masks distancing. ‚ÄúFor sake argument, let‚Äôs say thing completely made true‚Äù Thanks abbot. Hope next tree finishes job. I'm moving goalpost. Nearly every article covid full comments bad conservatives anti-vax. 

Yeah, mostly conservatives vaxed, part problem. That‚Äôs 100% said, you‚Äôre literally making things up. It‚Äôs written right article Biden implying improper pressure placed FDA approve vaccine. literally says exact thing. sounds like lot reasonable parents. Would stupid send 5 year old germ factory pandemic. alive parents much important 5 year old Kindergarten. No. want dead. want vaccinated die. refuse vaccination COVID lays low, skin nose. Natural selection. 

Yes. need get rest world vaxxed - one reason wealthy countries like donating vaccines left right effort exactly that. 

Fuck me, going end civilization. going endless cycles fucking plague stupidity antivaxxers poverty nations.   ‚ÄúBars, restaurants, shaking hands, kisses, hugs, concerts, normal life, fuck that. It‚ÄôS nEvEr CoMiNg BaCk. NIUW NORMALITAAAAH‚Äù

It‚Äôs thing 2nd amendment fetishists talk gun control. say, ‚Äúwell knives?‚Äù Yea, knives also kill people, let‚Äôs solve one problem figure next. demand problems get solved likely outcome solve none. make sense? course, whether infected children die thing concerned about. even become severely sick, may long-lasting complications, could affect development, learning, life general.

This virus weird affects many people differently ‚Äì much still unknown long-term effects. sister going cite Veganism religious excuse getting vaccine work claiming cultures consider Veganism religion. wish kidding. Also, she‚Äôs vegan.

What would HR even say that?! people rails. I'm talking opting natural immunity instead vaccination. Hence ""if COVID, get vaccinated""

I'm talking us already it. I'd 100% get vaccinated COVID already, I'd tested negative (or low) antibody cell labs.  disagree anything said. interest full disclosure, I'll honest tell fully support vaccine mandates able take shot. see nothing wrong ""the needs many"" outweighing wants/wishes/ignorance/unfounded fears few.

The examples gave good, sound. *none* potential result illness death many others. cruise industry leave local waters.

Which option. Nearly cruise ships flagged countries required federal law go foreign countries US embarkment disembarkment. 

If drop anchor coast Florida two weeks, they'd violation federal law.  UK Office National Statistics (ONS) publishes seroprevalence reports UK population. 
Most recent one end July shows UK reaching around 90% positive antibodies SARS-COV-2 spike protein whether vaccination infection. 

It also shows positive nucleocapsid antibodies gained infection possible inactivated viral vaccines although inactivated viral covid vaccine currently used UK. 

This measured among blood donors could selection bias. weighted aligns pretty well vaccine uptake.

Page France surprisingly close too.

Which surprising considering huge antivax base.

That vaccine passport entree req bars really help. gut feeling. I'm looking forward shutting segment anti vaxxers standing behind 'It'S aPprOvED!!' Fuck Ron DeSantis. similarly hesitant seat belt laws? refuse wear mask don‚Äôt think going pay attention ‚Äòlockdown‚Äô either. Keep pushing mask mandates employers start requiring vaccines. thing lockdowns good jacking economy employment. isn‚Äôt anything new, government already mandates kinds vaccines. You‚Äôre acting like new development. I'm fully vaccinated, somewhat increased risk severe covid, high transmission area.

I'd still go see movie crowded showing, I'd wear surgical mask theater. That's personal risk tolerance level vs precaution acceptance level. Lots side effects happened aside death aren‚Äôt. highly effective vaccines. family member pro vax proudly brags ""Fauci Ouchie"" hilarious cute. Omg ur right! early September, vaccines fully approved, mandate vaccines every public school, university, hospital, etc. businesses require well. I'm glad u agree!! people getting virus get vaccine, mention don‚Äôt know long immunity last. People here, general, favor increased government power control stand opposition liberty many circumstances.

what even mean - one circumstance: COVID. sure hypothetical ""many circumstances"" referring they're inapplicable here. 

COVID stopping lot people living normal life. immune system issue health issue preventing getting vaccine, FDA approved like hep a/b vaccines etc, there's absolutely reason based science get it.

Stop trying make actually is, rolling tanks cities control every aspect life. stopping virus becoming problem already is. Nothing more. slippery slope. speculation UK caseloads getting really old. believe though R0 1, seems like doomsday posts ‚Äúoh it‚Äôs rising‚Äù one two days data bit misplaced. rise again? I‚Äôm sure. point care whole lot though health outcomes. vaccines ~95 % effective severe outcomes, even Delta. We‚Äôve variant variant emerge **and none seemed chipped away vaccine efficacy severe illness.**

... worst (almost certainly) past.

[29.7% world population received least one dose COVID-19 far over, next decades, particularly bad variants going pop think it‚Äôs bad people deal crushing psychological weight falsely believing COVID bad ever been.

OK?? Bit straw man argument. said, I'm accurate understanding. also possible understand terrible things time psychologically crushing. Highly vaccinated states areas seeing hospitals overwhelmed COVID patients probably never again.

So? said ""And impression problem COVID lethality?"" gave reasons simply death vs. everything 100% OK. wanted know care beyond simple mortality rate, told It‚Äôs highly doubtful variant truly threatens vaccinated going sneak us,

The virus reproduces opportunities mutate, result, problematic variants become likely. doubt want, carefully define ""sneak us"" want, etc., problem certain evolution.

The delta variant coming certainty. way got unlucky, also got lucky worse one developed yet. I'm sure people doubted something like delta variant would emerge did, yet case new variants going emerging overwhelmingly unvaccinated Global South rather unvaccinated people rich countries simply former astronomically larger population.

You think you‚Äôre healthy invincible you‚Äôre not. you‚Äôre deathbed, fighting life crying like baby. That‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening everywhere right now.

Don‚Äôt talk freedom comment arguing people‚Äôs right live. virus mutates vaccines 100% effective. effective enough develop real herd immunity without overwhelming hospitals collapsing society, enough people take it.

You‚Äôve convinced me. need vaccine mandates *exactly* idiots like you.  I'm hospital worker Brevard county, I'm exhausted. Ron DeSantis lunatic. It‚Äôs funny people politicizing virus  Funny nations - collective whole. state database. There's national database. think lot populace afraid wear masks take precautions forever, might overcompensating.

I think compliance would've plummeted either way, CDC recommends one thing another, rather because, like not, **people tired this, want get back normal.** people brief taste ""freedom,"" they'll reluctant go back, even initially complied scientific guidance. saying that's good thing, that's human behavior. German speaking world going real straggler Western Europe. seems we've underestimated hesitancy significantly.  Thanks, vaccine resisters. Eat phallus.

Sad infuriating  Maybe 800,000,001st dose one :P stupid would attend something like right now? see end.

At least talking tracking biochips, alien DNA ""liberal mind control drugs."" Flat Earth sort bad, mostly stupid, talking points lunacy.  Random back envelope math, personal curiosity anything. 

Let C1 = number people infected COVID given timepoint. R = reproductive rate virus. C2 = number people infect. V = vaccination rate uninfected population. E = vaccine efficacy. 

Then say C2 = C1*R*(1-V*E)

In completely unvaccinated population, C2 = C1*R. R delta 7, 10 people infect 70 people.

Let's use vaccine efficacy 80% R 7 delta. percent people need immunized cases fall? Pretty easy figure out: C2 C1, cases rising. C2 &lt; C1, falling. C2 = C1 threshold balance tipped rising &amp; falling. 

So let's C2 = C1, R = 7, Efficacy = 90%, solve V. 

C2 = C2*7*(1-V*0.9)

The C2s cancel, simplify:

1 = 7*(1-V*0.9)
1= 7-6.3*V
-6 = -6.3*V

and V = 0.95, 95%. **For virus R=7 vaccine 90% effective, 95% people need fully vaccinated herd immunity.** Note applies whole population, ""eligible"" population. That's... tall order.

What R ~2.5, original COVID virus? much change things? Using formula:

1 = 2.5*(1-V*0.9) V = 67%! See huge difference original COVID delta. 

Let's go back delta say vaccine efficacy 80% instead 90%

1 = 7*(1-V*0.8) V = actually 107%. Vaccinating 100% people literally enough. (This makes sense intuitive level. R 7, 100 people would infect 700. 700 vaccinated, 80% effective, 700*0.8 = 560 protected, 140 still get COVID. 100 people infect 140, cases rise). 

Can someone correct I'm wrong this? take-home understanding virus R 7, herd immunity virtually impossible vaccination alone. would need people (including children) vaccinated 90% effective vaccine start dropping cases.

The caveat people immunity prior infection, vaccines. effectively add vaccination rate (but without double-counting). Still..... I'm feeling well never go away. likely fine vaccinated though. risk spreading others. Boosters help prevent breakthroughs though.  American bread basically sugar, yes. Father seven , says lot judgement Nothin' nothin' leaves nothin Humans, greater degee, americans, T. Kinda crap Kentucky residents infected SARS-CoV-2 2020, vaccination status reinfected May‚ÄìJune 2021 compared residents reinfected. case-control study, unvaccinated associated 2.34 times odds reinfection compared fully vaccinated.

It‚Äôs comparing people got covid 1+ year ago people got vaccine within last 6 months. don‚Äôt event think vaccine last 1+ years without booster think mainline pay well except FAs. Ramp Gate Agents pay crap - like $13 hour. Half world?

85% world's population still fully unvaccinated. Yes, exactly, data viral load unvaccinated initially, drops much faster vaccinated unvaccinated people. picture graph head recall study from. virus particles = less sick

Not necessarily, Provincetown cases, viral load nasal swabs identical vaccinated unvaccinated, according CDC. assume vaccinated got less sick vaccinations jobs. people less sick (vaccinated) equal viral load people got sick (unvaccinated). 

I agree would seem weird someone even aware sick carrying high viral load. works Mareks vaccination chickens. Vaccinated chickens walk around completely unphased high viral load, give unvaccinated chicken dies. wish data Provincetown cluster made public, surely everyone interviewed somebody knows answer question. CDC could said viral loads equal, severe cases. didn't. USA Today article said vaccinated people ""higher"" viral load, section online article quickly scrubbed. clear ""higher"" anyway. Higher expected? higher unvaccinated people? never clarified deleted part article. question Ive wondering infectious Delta compared original SARS virus?

That virus hit fast well (its incubation period way less Alpha SARS-CoV-2). 

It's big reason virus blow like SARS-CoV-2 did. 

It really matter much grand scheme things (since SARS-CoV thing since around 04), I'm curious. kids getting infected, local School district San Jose CA says person learning. 

1 year ago vaccine children
Today, vaccine children.

So really can't figure changed allows open schools. Vaccinated people still pass virus even though symptom less. #Delta entered chat# J&amp;J test efficacy symptomatic infection? people stupid. worldwide pandemic deadly virus can't get wear mask, know will. reckless least humility change tone. people survive downplay whole thing.

But father, what‚Äôs best family. solely want. stats clear odds suffering adverse effect COVID outweighs odds adverse effect shot. Eskimo sisters school district South close literally thousands deaths among children. tied political agendas some, that's honest truth. kids 12 attending school person state banned mask mandates school. worried children want keep safe costs.

I wish could vaccinated now, time think rushing EUA vaccines could backfire result fewer kids getting vaccinated.

But hope EUA comes sooner later proper steps taken. got go back earlier that. first thing told people don‚Äôt bother wearing masks. least don‚Äôt wear surgical n95. credibility gone that. Seems like desperate attempt preserve business model. Imagine, knowing that

* they've administered well 780 million doses Pfizer/Moderna globally
* every single one countries constantly scrutinizing data (and other's data)
* health experts countries deem vaccines safe enough well-justified, actually *promoted* everyone 12+ (outside fringe cases)
* leaders countries taking vaccines guidance health experts
* every single manufacturer Russia/China vested interest showing vaccines market less safe own
* health experts outside government would gain fame fortune discovering risk uncovered above

and still thinking there's chance hell vaccines may safe enough gain approval Recommend 'Weapons Math Destruction' Cathy O'Neil dangers AI algorithms. still certain party rhymes perpublican still vote well party rhymes shmemocrats.

I'm incredibly anti-covid think lock downs vaccines enforced there's 0 cases left. think anyone happy live covid fool. 

But would never treat death vaccine refuser trivial justified outcome. man husband father two young boys. models really bad track record, often bunch models widely different results.

Why people think entitled treat healthcare workers like this? picking slack strength what's right. Tbh, I'm surprised happened yet Florida may alter death/case numbers, hard time believing would able alter vaccine numbers. 

All reliable sources vaccine counts (CDC, Covidactnow, NY Times), show Florida 49% total population fully vaccinated.

For example, UK decided lift restrictions last month. Experts predicted huge explosion new cases. Everyone held breath. Cases start going up, up. suddenly peaked started dropping. like roller coaster ride without screaming. going steadily ever since. Looks like UK gamble. anyway.

In Canada, cases started dropping steadily vaccination effort ramped up. much like US. started climb back restrictions lifted, sharply. like kiddie roller coaster. Experts predicting 4th wave September, kids go back school businesses recall employees.

You skip normal approval process they‚Äôll complaining well.

Also look surveys, full approval going make huge difference hesitant.  *Let's this!* people say ""why get vaccinated? already it""

But noticed said better late never comment. I'm sure I'll get jumped this, think concerned mandating treatment yet approved FDA? I'm little uneasy mandating medical issues, ideally patient doctor (though realize need level mandate things like public schools, people make stupid choices, choices harm others).

It seems like mandating treatment yet fully approved bit far. many want taken court mandate EUA full approval, they're waiting once. Nobody knows. quite possible 30k people actually really low. impossible say ""low"" ""high"" context nation restrictions (which nations eventually).

It might people still careful (50% pre-pandemic contacts) lowest covid ever again.

Van Ranst estimates variant Spain accounts 5 10 percent new infections. ""In Belgium, numbers small""; dozen, virologist explains. striking fatal outbreak residential care center Ter Burg municipality Zaventem near Brussels.

Had two pricks

The virus presumably entered ward patients advanced dementia via visitor. first contamination established mid-July. Since then, twenty residents staff members tested positive. Seven 28 residents died, despite fact double vaccinated BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine.

""I think two possibilities,"" says Van Ranst. ""For example, variant, vaccine less protective."" second option relates back fact residents vaccinated six months ago. vulnerable group, effect vaccine decreases quickly, according Flemish virologist. ""We also see flu shot: lasts six months elderly."" Nevertheless, Van Ranst emphasizes still early firm conclusions.

Infection vaccination

In case, current vaccines offer 100 percent protection covid-19. statistically inevitable small proportion fully vaccinated people still become infected develop symptoms. vaccination make chances happening much smaller without vaccination.

The older person weaker immune system, greater chance illness infection. Especially contagious delta variant. extent might apply Colombian variant still unclear.

'No evidence additional infectivity'

Public Health England recently reported evidence found Colombian variant infectious currently dominant delta variant. However, preliminary data suggest current vaccines may less effective B.1.621. since 37 infections yet identified England, research variant also infancy UK.

""It could also Colombian variant never really gains foothold, like P1 variant Brazil,"" says field epidemiologist Amrish Baidjoe. hundreds virus variants surfaced, become dominant. Like delta variant (first found India) alpha variant (first surfaced UK).

Delta variant greatest concern

Research show dangerous B.1.621 is. Baidjoe: ""The infectious delta variant clearly remains biggest concern right now. look happened Flemish nursing home, good keep eye variant.""

So does. World Health Organization listed variant worrisome enough monitor. That's step Variant Concern (VOC) Variant Interest (VOI), potential impact still unclear. also explains Columbian mutation yet named letter Greek alphabet. happens case VOC VOI.

The ECDC, European RIVM, Colombian variant somewhat emphatically radar. Van Ranst: ""There reason panic, concerns. delta variant also started cases weeks later accounted 96 percent infections.""

But based wording (not lawyer though), seems like EUA approval requires lack available approved alternative treatment. approval, withdrawn longer needed (or becomes fully HHS Secretary‚Äôs EUA declaration terminate earlier of: (1) determination HHS Secretary circumstances precipitated declaration ceased (after consultation appropriate Secretary Homeland Security Secretary Defense), (2) change approval status product authorized use(s) product longer unapproved (section 564(b)(2)).¬† example, EUA issued allow unapproved use approved product may longer needed product later approved FDA use permitted discussed section III.G guidance, EUA may also revoked certain conditions.


Makes sense. If/when Pfizer/biontech gets approved,.new EUA like novavax (though FDA says grandfathered approved) slightly different. efficacy hospitalization 96%, means 4% hospitalized people control group hospitalized vaccinated group (where groups include people healthy sick).

So take group unvaccinated people big enough include 100 hospitalizations Covid, equally big group vaccinated people include 4 hospitalizations Covid. need excuse get vaccine. Amen got - headline.

Pretty hypocritical. Also whole part works others. ‚ÄúhOW DoCtoR SAve Isn‚Äôt JeSuz?‚Äù  sad , pray recovery hope 100% I'm vaccinated.

But none employer's damn business health records are. None all.  spell Wayward Righter? vaccine eliminate risk getting infected spreading others, (almost) eliminate risk developing symptoms severe enough put hospital, worse. Data US shown last months delta variant prevalent, almost 95%) patients hospitalized vaccinated, vaccination rate among whole population roughly half.

Also, think way: it‚Äôs 100% 90% effective? Even it‚Äôs 10% effective, it‚Äôs still better 0. almost non-existent chance developing significant side effects vaccine, benefit out-weighs risk magnitudes. mean would think would purpose EUA somehow still bogged much bureaucracy. definitely frustrating watching outside idea what's actually going knowing takes long review data.  pedantic EU ‚â† Europe.The AZ vaccine developed UK, Moderna vaccines produced Lonza's facility Switzerland, Novartis(also swiss) working Pfizer-BioNTech, etc. ask me, god gave us vaccines ability help survive. take save life someone else‚Äôs? anyone take article seriously referenced vaccine ""covid jab"" Social media needs grab reins silence misinformation campaign.

Again, getting me.

Countries already economic problems relied heavily tourism larger drops 2020 :


Italy -8,9%

Spain -10.8% 

Greece -8.2%



Countries rely lot tourism dropped less :


Sweden -2,8%

Romania -3,9%


""Rebound"" also easier countries already better pandemic, especially since less 2020 ""loss"" recover, predicted growth 2021 :


Italy +5%

Spain +6.2%

Greece +4.3%




Sweden +4.6%

Romania +7.4% (highest EU)


So see Romania Sweden finish 2021 larger economies pre pandemic levels, despite Romania lockdowns really smart ""economic"" moves. Pre pandemic inertia seeing.


Lockdowns great ideas either (unless stopped hospitals hitting capacity), silly pretend Sweden genius approach, didn't. deaths neighbors much show it. mean daily rate? Cos do, Australia constant days 0 cases amongst 25m people. NZ would still 0 every day That's *infectiosness*, infection severity. produces cases, infected dangerous alpha covid please 12s?  2020 closures, mask mandates, lockdowns.

2021 mask mandates, vaccine mandates, closures.

2022 vaccine mandates mask mandates. Idk, also live city maybe 10% people wearing masks outside. definitely feel like I‚Äôm minority mask on.  Delta 1000 times viral load alpha sure, ok.

You must also aware non vaccinated people transmit infection showing symptoms.

Also, new class drug new known little now. partly mRNA vaccines able get created EUA quickly. Given many millions people vaccinated, issues far enough evidence safe.

I admit would first line, point, 100 millionth dose, realize huge risk. Tackling long term issues difficult, however, given large enough population find potential long term complications pretty quickly.

These things often appear curve. small percent would show problems quickly days likely, rate appearance would keep increasing peak, similar drop rose. think seeing behavior.

This matches say mRNA vaccine functions. infects cells causes produce protein shell virus capability mRNA propagate further, activity done hours.

Well I'm sure that's fair since every state, states every county, differently. recall often times health care workers ""whistleblowing"" issue. I'm trying keep open mind.  America gotten fat we've forgotten normal looks like. I'm technically overweight pounds (170 @ 5 feet 11) get told I'm skinny, need eat something, on. No, y'all fuckers need lose weight. especially annoying comments come someone twice size say need lose weight, I'm bad guy. I'm vaxxed still following measures, think hospital near capacity unvaxxed people covid sent home, medication suffer. bad person this? ability control bad guy narrative. I‚Äôd start laying thick now: sad kids can‚Äôt see family family loves unvaccinated kids. Lay like quadruple fat buttercream frosting next 5 months. Act way selfish old granny would. Fake cry lmao circumstances accept story *youre* bad guy Let‚Äôs fair, celebrity could probably start get rid hangers on.  change vaccinated adults well I've seen chart [this indicates Moderna seems particularly effective hospitalization (from Canadian data).

Looks good me! yeah news came one dog getting covid (this vaccines) absolutely would first line (to protect doggies.) 


her sister hand... Florida vaccination rate 50% fully vaxxed national average. hospitals full 200 deaths yesterday‚Ä¶.. Sounds great realize larger percentage minorities aren‚Äôt vaccinated you‚Äôre advocating healthcare system turn treatment non-whites far higher numbers. sad.   Morbid obesity age 11. god  use available tools mitigate fears... like say vaccine global pandemic. Bats known carriers Coronavirus (and may implicated COVID-19, verdict still out). trying figure whitetail deer got infected, may grazing near roost bat colony. would first guess.

edit: typos That's good news, right? spate articles US recent days hospitals filling child patients, UK articles safe children are. I'm sure account difference. sound like notable increase child hospital admissions serious negative outcomes UK delta wave, countries (beyond US) reported significantly child deaths before.  really care, easy thing pretend vaccinated internet spread bullshit. Florida vaccinated 50% population basically US average. hospitals near capacity 200 deaths. Yesterday. I‚Äôm sure bad sounds? Delta starting spread mid Atlantic North East regions well. 160,000,000 people fully vaccinated US that‚Äôs lot fucking kindling fire. think one things distinctly different COVID vs Polio impact young healthy much less obvious COVID. 

Long COVID life altering, completely invisible people walking hallway. wheel chair everyone knows. u/Ulyks said reddit 18 days ago 
 
""I read ridiculous headline again. 
 
Why Asia's 'Zero Covid' strategy could backfire

Why journalists new organisation want paint countries succeeded clamping virus lacking something? 
 
Is ashamed horrible toll allowed take countries? 
 
It's logical human strategy country take. Short lockdown quarantines borders everyone vaccinated. quarantines lifted. 
 
Minimal economic damage, minimal death toll, minimal mutations. Everybody wins. (except covid19) 
 
And real news India actually suffered 4 million dead instead 400 thousand nowhere seen."" Oh yeah mean don‚Äôt know logicstics work, I‚Äôm thinking there‚Äôs supply people work hospital beds anywhere, places stay closed won‚Äôt people staff them, covid care system collapses, people probably start staying home fear falling ill without healthcare workers take care shit gets bad.

So unofficial standpoint, could see unofficial lockdowns makes sense Ok. One used vaccines then. Still proper data delta variant despite link model? understanding projection UK always 50K. upper confidence interval take 100K+ though. Keep believing fear want. restrictions cases fine, hardly deaths, mean WTF even about? *Oklahoma Neanderthal governor would like join chat Lmaooo. many vaccine options need? üòÇ bullshit excuse  even microwave home. Everything cooked, good know cook yourself.  made 0 efforts late, that‚Äôs flu 2017 sick enough scare getting flu shot every year. tired first excused 6 day work week.

Overall we're roughly 10% behind adults vaccinated us. 70% adults atleast 1 dose 88% atleast 1 dose. We've done teens since UK really vaccinated teens yet. Adults generally risk hospitlisation teens almost 20% lower vaccination rate worry especially states lowest vaccination rates. see us huge differences hospitlisation figures highest vaccinated states lowest vaccinated states. Makes wish blowgun blowdarts filled vaccines help vaccinate ~ 50% adult pop FULLY vaccinated. That's issue. half get 2nd jab, things continue suck long time. here's version scans:

So one told life gonna way

Mutation's joke, mandate's DOA

Choose vaccination choose Facebook fears

And feels like 2020's lasted twenty long years, but

I‚Äôll mask you, til rates start fall‚Ä¶ Really poor analogy concur!  OH breaks heart hear that. handle pain, fact could take pain endure would. kid ever go experience. know must've torture parent see kid go that. Keep family safe. I'll hoping never repeat experience again. attempt get vaccines done. Fans feel rejected unless vaccinate. tried tell us tuna processed, DNA changed. GMAFB!   That's healthcare works. swear harm, pick choose whose life choices we'll deign support.

If want break remaining threads morale healthcare system still has, force us make kind decision advocating for.

Just get vaccinated, encourage others so. sober drive car, still risk people drunk driving. well, ok, thanks clarifying, SinoVac even approved used Peru, lol.

Anyway, countries severe shortages, even effective vaccine is, simply enough deliveries.  Difference taking life negligence others. 

That level self entitlement also diagnosed.. 

Its like budgie jumping rope tied gram-gram. can't really use Scotland one one comparison, though. rate 4k also significantly higher previous record 7da, somewhere around 2500. could easily said ""in Scotland case numbers went far higher ever before, happen England"" (which seemed feeling time). numbers generally seem end different lot time. current vaccine delevoped January 2020 still highly effective.

Coronaviruses able mutate fast flu, people fine one shot every year even every year.

It combined flu vaccine longterm anyway, Moderna working it. even include RSV. Yup tuna tuna bread found yoga mat type ingredients. Also can't called healthy Scotland think was, bread found large amounts sugar it. Subway FAR fresh healthy.  UK, ramped tests almost anyone else autumn/winter, still enough stop second/third wave vaccinations kicked (Alpha help either, Delta would even worse)

Just mass testing way covid-19 might've worked original variant (like South Korea), deffo Delta.    love anti vaxxers acting holier thou, whining simple health measures would help get everyone pandemic. expectation know better? lot brainwashed birth. victims shit surprising country pushed Jesus schtick long.  This. get people can't seem understand vaccinate. did. went middle school science class realise people refuse get vaccinated circle good idea.  Well that‚Äôs wonderful hear.  utterly heartbreaking familiar.

We talk children low risk level COVID, ignoring fact data children taken lock downs, remote schooling, social distancing, mask mandates.

We talk many children ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù ignore epidemic childhood obesity type two diabetes.

It‚Äôs dichotomous manner thinking need stop normalizing deliberately obtuse way thinking.

If downplay covid protest masks year might afraid losing face getting vaccinated, could seen admission Covid fact dangerous disease need vaccinate against. need antibody test. Correct, remember little vaccination booklet young got meningitis vaccine. Definitely new.. said whole lot without saying anything all. It‚Äôs Saturday, time smoke blunt don't, wanted ask guys heard it. What's like? Meat, good! Potatoes, good! Vaccine , gooooood! Yes It‚Äôs unusual live one county receive medical treatment another. Commerce close county line. Also, doesn‚Äôt tell whether hospitals short staff due staff falling ill covid, people deciding can‚Äôt take quitting, number open positions can‚Äôt fill.  obese person get type 2. used generally adults need time accumulate amount fat. last 20 years level obesity happening teens too.  think it‚Äôs raw, forceful stupidity Wow, that's interesting solution. Basically keep one portion society(the unvaxxed) away regular every day life? think people would willing admit going knee jerk reaction one shot must much worse two. vaccinated still spread Covid Jennifer who? pissed antivaxxers. could one hell good summer. hypothesis cells infected virus keep producing antigen weeks even months. shot get? covid march nothing sore throat tired 2 days. completely fine smell/taste like 2 days.  Covid, careful biggest change economic output consumer behavior.

I live Stockholm point didn‚Äôt formal lockdown soft one people voluntarily worked home reduced exposure crowds. meant much fewer people public transport, restaurants shops. reduced economic activity lot sectors never went zero businesses still open (with restrictions). could still shop eat restaurants many did. 

It surprising meant less economic impact compared countries opted completely close many businesses.  anyone lost friends this? I'm lucky enough friends getting/have gotten vaccine People share beliefs think referring regular cake days every then. Friends come cake!  want lowest chance passing new variant, feel millions upon millions safe doses given enough approval comfortable. next excuse new vaccine options come up? last excuses made move excuse? thats old newer reports coming says natural better. article says vaccines better natural.  No, we‚Äôre talking Sweden. I‚Äôll explain Denmark Norway agree Sweden would less spread death enacted restrictions. Something even Tegnell acknowledged. got within 6 months natural immunity? know ""well get vaccine anyways"" reports coming lately natural stronger. people get vaccine covid. excuse really kept past 8 years dealing health issues Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. yes first time recall hearing it, especially someone young. knew age bracket creeping really shocking see creep far. time get Delta booster Lambda new hotness. virus moves faster government agencies... seems different since clinic's procedures protect staff always taking precautions bloodborne pathogens. knowledge make difference protect patient.

Vaccination status someone I'm office *does* affect need protect person infection.

Also know law Austria many US states withholding HIV status people unprotected sex share needles crime.

One person's confidentiality valuable health others. vaccine**

just leaving died causes well, would died even get covid Why? covid reports coming lately natural stronger. ever get vaccine? least wait full FDA. yesssss man wish death finally live remember EVEN SAVES ONE LIFE, RIGHT???? course is.

And money grubbing peddlers psuedoscience, Trump's bizarre antisocial ramblings, opposition vaccines masks. may get slightly sick admitted hospital give someone else vaccine whose health compromised (or previous existing condition) - therefore would put lives risk.""

This something I've said times reddit, downvoted for.

So many people vaccinated feel invisible force field around them, cannot get sick. I'm glad got vaccine, clearly understand vaccines work.

I've heard people furious friends vaccine, everything immediately opened things back normal. one guy reddit argue saying ""we promised get vaccine, everything would open again""

good lord, next day buddy. Fuck.   something lot boomers seem get. ""ItS oPiNiOn"" seems law land. opinion sky orange, talk facts already got covid already then? Whats answer. friend recently take Facebook tell people stop posting FB whenever got vaccine ‚Äúshaming‚Äù people haven‚Äôt gotten it. bit back forth public health coming private nonsense concerns removed friend nothing value lost. cease giving preference patients aren‚Äôt vaccinated? former Biden official, story cloth masks. Fox rots brain. Purely anecdotal, but:

My husband COVID January. got vaccinations, thought he‚Äôd protected reinfection six months year.

He currently COVID. don‚Äôt.

Again, purely anecdotal, still. virus elegant unpredictable. Protect loved much possible. Please get vaccinations wish knew long natural lasted. Wearing seat belt personal choice. Exposing others deadly airborne disease not. segregate ppl vaccinated not? could whichever variant reached critical mass first. Lambda Delta equally transmissible, probably ever one lands first gets good foothold starts run away rest pack. feel like tests healthcare workers could skewed. theory since controlled environment everyone following safety protocols, also exposed daily, got lots small viral loads long period time enough build natural immunity. None you‚Äôve said changes fact J&amp;J uses established technology.

The mRNA vaccines great got one, people can‚Äôt convinced so, better get another vaccine nothing all. ""**took 6 weeks go back 100,000 (documented cases per day) despite vaccine""**

Spin way like. People getting sick. lot them. six weeks went okay okay. Hunt County COVID numbers staggering**. According Texas Department State Health Services, reported 312 active cases COVID county confirmed cases (5,769) rank barely top 50 highest state.

I understand assertion (bolding mine) situation staggering. someone familiar situation explanation? Oh ok see confusion now, didn‚Äôt realize speaking Austria. US medical staff informed favorite politicians told hurricane trying take away freedom, they‚Äôd proudly get wiped it. Proverbs 13:16 - Every prudent man acts knowledge, fool flaunts folly.

The irony biblical Jesus would want people get vaccinated, address prevent problem suffered needlessly. people convinced faith alone solve problems they'll ever have. can't become victim problem every opportunity prevent ask expect Lord help you. That's works.  So? know catch once, right? know catch one variant time, right? know covid, youve vaccinated, still catch spread covid right?  want kill people. possible answer. She‚Äôs vaccinated. 

She still catch CoVid pass someone else.

She doesn‚Äôt want happen.

So avoids unvaccinated friends.

I understand logic. But‚Ä¶as points out, vaccinated people still get spread CoVid. also avoiding friends vaccinated too, right? friends could get CoVid, pass her, could pass another vaccinated friend. also Delta? completely agree available mitigation treatment vulnerable, there's mission creep booster reduces chance death 0.0001 0.00001. targeted reasonable application. Wow, comments article mess!

Do know much Lambda - compare Delta terms severity? right there's currently little information/data current vaccines work it? crazies get attention situations. sane ones never hear. smile nod crazies choose current lesser crazy choose. protection levels vaccinated infected symptoms vaccinated death rates infected vaccinated infected vaccinated? fact youre even asking speaks volumes failures government keep public informed covid exactly vaccines are. already one still investigation iirc. alpha delta rounds care home, may special case. evidence vaccines reducing infectious ness new variants limited. correct. Maybe different US, Austria need told. Wow that‚Äôs fucked up. I‚Äôm struggling wrap brain around stupidity. p&lt;0.05? statistically significant. possible sample size small. one cares old washed celebrity thinks. fact don‚Äôt care think.  Look tag, doctor myself, no, patients need tell admitted hospital, least Austria Peyote every Sunday morning would get lot people back pews again‚Ä¶ also run risk drowning looking rains. state officials Texas denying funding requests hospitals cases surge across state, providing $5.39bn earlier pandemic, reimbursed Fema, according local news channel WFAA.

They're still actively assisting Covid point. Blaming others come later. It‚Äôs worth risk whole move depending it. would circumstances risk Yes accident medical procedure Vaxed people dying covid, rarely hospitalized. Diversify news sources. Yeah, like job pretty much ostracized society option antibody test substitute. Going Oxbridge means nothing. social cachet snobbery, that's all. know quite Oxbridge/Ivy League graduates exactly sort giant morons would this. pretty interesting finding given [Public Health England previously 1 dose AZ also *exactly* 71% efficacy Delta (92% two doses). Given similar technology, make wonder 1 dose J&amp;J performing similarly Delta 1 dose AZ.

For reference, [PHE also 1 dose AZ 30% efficacy symptomatic infection Delta (compared 67% two doses). It‚Äôs shame J&amp;J study doesn‚Äôt report symptomatic infection rates give us clearer picture. Medical staff gets exposed, though  (had?) friend who‚Äôs making questionable choices pandemic. I‚Äôve trying quite hard judge. 

When took second dose asked booked. wasn‚Äôt. taking it. can‚Äôt fathom anyone put anything body took nine months develop. 

I sent article back asked: mean years research related corona vaccines PLUS nine months right? 

Haven‚Äôt heard since. keeps seeing stories etc like/comment like used to. nothing. feels weird. also feels weird she‚Äôs antivaxxer. son won‚Äôt getting either. 

Got thinking friends I‚Äôve underestimated too‚Ä¶ logic flawed dude since cannot use one explanation 3x difference Sweden Denmark another 3x difference Denmark Norway. course, do, logical. 

You using logic, parroting. went full approval Australia well, I'm sure reasons go route FDA, definitely thought risky. dropping UK Try frame like bank account. isn‚Äôt exact perfect analogy, you‚Äôre trying paint picture convince someone could helpful. got covid put $100 antibody bank account. survive $100, got vaccine would add extra $500 antibody bank account. Maybe don‚Äôt need $500 based budget, $100 don‚Äôt enough emergencies might pop up. vaccine emergency fund choice affects others. don‚Äôt right provide service infectious example. it‚Äôs choice, wear consequences choice. I‚Äôm sure understand you‚Äôre trying say. What‚Äôs 21%? 30 people? It‚Äôs news years. Childhood obesity causing epidemic type 2 kids. individual level, may need nasal vaccine. society need tools arsenal well time additional knowledge create tools. started situation one- public health measures, clearly enough. issue see uncontrolled spread. goal control spread, believe still given long covid unknowns future variants may render vaccine ineffective, available interventions better every additional intervention brings situation control. rest atheists, we'd 90% received least one shot right now? 

Ironically, we're gonna ones ruining Christmas year. Ha. study Delta would expect Florida. Childhood obesity led ton kids w type 2. Tragic. HIV airborne. can't catch HIV merely sharing air office mates. saying fact Sweden kept economy open going countries locked down, positive impact economic retraction

Neglibeable.

The biggest change economic output consumer behavior.

People need government tell things. themselves.

Same big business. 

People see pandemic, much less people go cinema, restaurants, clubs, etc, lot businesses shut since can't operate profit low customer flow. 

People longer go holidays, sport events get canceled, etc.



Also, there's pretty big misconception Sweden, yes lockdowns, take anti-COVID measures. early March last year friends Sweden sent work home.


Look US companies starting demand employees vaccinate. need government tell that. allowing employees work home. 


Governments less effect economies went COVID think.


My country (Romania) dumpster fire handling pandemic, despite leading economic recovery EU. teach bit obesity hypoventilation syndrome. change lung mechanics extreme weight, effect obese inflammatory responses, responses blood gases, bunch things. obese people develop OHS, do. Check Chile. ravaged Gamma Lambda able put data Coronavac versus two variants. booster talk due Delta variant evading immunity, think body's immunity waning within year. comparison may actually appropriate vaccines designed initial variant. course, would also nice see vaccination compares recent infections.  Thank help. true catastrophic peak September though. don‚Äôt think healthcare system make long. near limits now.  Stop negative test bullshit, vaccinated isn‚Äôt unvaccinated risk vaccinated‚Ä¶

It‚Äôs unvaccinated risk business. turns out, many business don‚Äôt function well employees sick extended periods time. let‚Äôs start conversation would happened unvaccinated employee infect patrons said business. Oh, many employers pay benefits, including medical insurance. Seeing group plan rates skyrocket isn‚Äôt ideal employees. 

This all-mighty dollar.  good thing did, Meningitis survivor want shit! 15% chance survive one point induced coma pumped blood anti-biotics me. POWERFUL one knows exactly Delta detected important numbers country South America, could mean two dominant variants (Gamma Lambda) contagious enough let Delta dominate. Remember though clinical trials suggested symptomatic illnesses would reduced 95% data places like Israel suggested asymptomatic cases would also reduced nearly 90%. infection = transmission. top viral load greatly reduced breakthrough infections, presumably making transmission unlikely.

Before delta lot epidemiologists really think vaccine would stop spread could really ‚Äúhot vaxx summer‚Äù anti-vaxxers mostly staying hospital via favorable summer weather plus significant herd immunity. CDC changed mask policy lot people actually criticized acknowledging vaccines significantly reduce transmission. it‚Äôs still true delta reduce extent, look inverse correlation vaccination rates case rates around US world.  Look homeschooling  Remindme! 2 months

Would curious actually get vaccinated approval eyes someone whose people lied manipulated time time science medical community, trust evidence? 

I‚Äôm confident data improved transparency morals. pains past sins resulting decreased ability help others. 

The morons spout 5G sterility conspiracies justify anti mask anti vaccine stances definitely using cop out. there‚Äôs group people actually harmed multiple government conspiracies, think they‚Äôre genuinely concerned could history repeating see YouTube video someone tested concept... extra unemployment benefit runs week vaccine expected. don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll problem They‚Äôve certainly go better advocating chiropractic coverage private health plans. biological computers. Invest Neuralink brain computer systems maybe fix can‚Äôt fix themselves.  left bedside nursing May, almost thirty years labor delivery. simply couldn‚Äôt face thought fourth wave retired early mental health.

Out curiosity concern former colleagues, looked pertinent articles yesterday former institution‚Äôs current status.

They‚Äôve completely full, across eight hospital system, last three days. One MFM doctors gave interview, stressing increase pregnant COVID-19 patients staggering highly concerning.

Every single day, decision retire strongly affirmed. feel colleagues  meant arrogant, aside trying correct criticism proves point arrogance. Lots Sturgis also indoors, since apparently 200 square mile two week long bar crawl tranquil ride mountains. Nobody stop punching crotch! NOBODY! children Delta variant say UK India hit?

I 5 yo starting kindergarten next week, near 3 yo daycare. We're Texas, so. hospitals serving predominantly minority communities subpar already, that‚Äôs separate issue. wouldn‚Äôt realize wasn‚Äôt audition even injected him. was. removed last month time. Cognitive dissonance  Since never tell anymore someone sarcastic not, said federal level, vaccine mandates local level.

Also, make decision, says automatically happen.

If making fun anti-vaxxers nevermind, carry on.   50 crore distributed‚Ä¶is 500MM doses? Wow, that‚Äôs huge number vaccinated! know still long way go, that‚Äôs really impressive number far. I‚Äôm saying don‚Äôt treat someone. I‚Äôm saying imagine there‚Äôs 10 ventilators 20 patients, 5 vaccinated. One way another, 10 can‚Äôt put ventilators. someone pointed misspelled it, Frank Lundy first person thought of.

Can‚Äôt believe they‚Äôre bringing Dexter back year too! yup. seattle one first explosions cases seems like things right. plenty experts listen would helped guide better ignored them. willingly ended here. 

get vaccinated arent already. wear mask. social distance can. wait... racist Chinese, latest post? racist SE Asians, previous reply? specific SE Asian countries choosing Sinovac I'm racist against? seem uncertain think hate. Let's clear first.

Or maybe unhappy Thai government chose, questionably corrupt circumstances, vaccine known least effective market, Lambda variant apparently even less so.

Oh wait, racist rich countries snapping supplies need leaving poorer countries fight remains?

Also, CNBC actually conduct study cited. online poll. referenced study article. find something wrong actual results suggest Sinovac effective Lambda based limited data currently available, I'd interested hearing opinion. Unfortunately, none descriptors apply American politics anymore.  problem then, now, people still think ‚Äúit won‚Äôt happen me‚Äù. comment, like many discussions freedom, proved point leaving hidden definition writer relying. could ask easy say freedom safety complementary. First week two September FINALLY SOMEONE SOUNDS SANE know what's subreddit, I'm going data CDC actually REAL testing, collected anecdotes.

Plus, go almost subreddit product see many posts ""Oh man, I'm many problems phone"" ""why speakers pair?"" That's people complaining saying negative things typically louder. People itch hour, went bed two hours early second day injection (my ""side effects"" vaccine much anything) go subreddits like frequently side effects complain about.

Look unbiased, objective sources information this, self selecting populations specific goal (talk side effects) mind creates biased view (all talk side effects).

And want anecdotes, everyone family vaccinated, coworkers vaccinated, friends vaccinated. single one anything life threatening, managed avoid rolling dice disease 1.7% [case mortality **17 times higher** 0.1% difference adverse events (which life *threatening* events, everyone experiences one dies), much may even statistically significant due rarity.  Children notably absent debates masks vaccines recently US. original surge, given didn‚Äôt seem effected, made sense. now, kids landing ICU delta we‚Äôre going (because dearth news coverage it) like kids still unaffected.  three vaccines available USA going make very, unlikely person received full regimen 'die Delta variant'. Delta lower cycle rate, something like 1-3 days instead 4-5 days. you‚Äôve Covid natural antibodies risk reinfection time vaccinated still get Covid? point it‚Äôs propaganda changes daily. isn‚Äôt government mandate. article even said federal government won‚Äôt mandate everyone. 

I usually employers, schools, etc able choose want require eit people make immune disease, prevents agains severe manifestations (as in: instead ICU, got coughs fever only) making shit then.  one hand ""Covid real!"" hand ""Illegal immigrants giving us Covid!"" know people believe things exact time.

When kind stupidity, truly feels hopeless. Uhhhh, what? read wrote? understand conscious thought works? 

Sure, thinking act speak thing. wild, I'm out. anyone else verify true?  Cloth masks surgical masks holes side err zero side.

Almost one wearing N95s asshole you‚Äôre not. Infection parties? evidence making shit make sleep better night?

How dense get sarcasm ?

It's quite obvious governor like DeSantis tourism heavy state that's dense get trouble sooner later. took anti COVID safety almost religious level.  Florida, similar population, also infections like Monday Tuesday Australia entire pandemic seems taken literally opposite approach. Heard totally sure. evidence capable spread exempt extreme symptoms. Looking link I‚Äôm completely fine wearing mask decide gets injected body  hardcore Trump still President people think faked getting trick libs Turns out, Fauci get decide.

No one force person inject body. simple. many variables. school reopening, Florida, lack mask mandates. things could easily prolong peak.

I think easy predict. proceeding cautiously possible, that's Florida rolls. Ahah! Thanks made smile sad time! I‚Äôll try old granny card!    Thank ALLCAPS LEGAL UPDATE No. literally cannot change decision. don‚Äôt get choose words ideas pop head. know going say next?

Oof, blanket statements generalizations. sexy. But, yes, Covid fluctuations throughout year depending activity. However commentor mocking anti-mask/vaccination crowd tend downplay significance illness. BTW, America isn‚Äôt bad. lot responsible intelligent people USA. don‚Äôt know feel like putting America makes feel like better person? kind sound like tool. I'm hearing people repeating Natural Immunity without understanding means variants necessarily long-term effect. great grandmother Christian Scientist. died breast cancer refusing go doctor found lump thought doom brought Delta, I've seen media posts ""catastrophic Human Society"" ""Collapse imminent"" Lambda. 

The Media raised volume high alarm there's nothing call everything Cataclysm. damn sick people using excuse Covid ‚Äúcold/flu‚Äù children stop caring. new variant thriving don‚Äôt know yet plays differently children. hard continue wearing mask kids get vaccinated? lives become less valued? would understand mentality everyone equal chance get vaccine, don‚Äôt even option. least continue careful long enough eligible too. also blame CDC lifting mask recommendations knew unvaccinated people would run it.  That‚Äôs Trump admin full grifters liars can‚Äôt trusted whatsoever  Wait virus mutates vaccine resistant form within year morons won‚Äôt get vaccinated declare martial law people start vomiting blood profusely. Plague inc easy mode beings cattle.

Nope, we're still animals irradiated virus. Good news, there's way out. Bad news, misinformation dumb humans ruining it.  hospital system already mandated  Actually majority wants fact democratic. something super specific understand super smart, know truth everything vaccines work. He's going review scientific papers understand them... year first vaccine came out. /s Fucking idiots! husband symptomatic? so, bad it? always going happen. Idk health experts transparent it. Viruses mutate survive. going keep happening. Rip India thing is, vaccinations seem easy straightforward mandate high schools colleges. vaccines already required school settings. Oh yeah. encounter lot home schooled kids. bright really well balanced‚Ä¶.but every one seems like parents wanna make sure indoctrinate completely without input rest society. It‚Äôs sad tel kid would flourish school kids. Conservatives totally perverted term ‚Äúpatriot‚Äù American flag matter. don‚Äôt know shit country say so, seriously doubt it.

Anway, Trump try pressure rush help re-election bid, failed Biden already president time people able get it. Anti vax folks getting really desperate they‚Äôre throwing racism card around  adults benefits far outweights bad effects: death rate vaccines 0.0016% vs covid 2% that's thousand better.
But kids 0.0016% vs 0.01% still better much. Besides know death rate vaccines kids.

That's still studies probably approved ages 5-12  UK 90% antibody rate cases falling. Totally different situation. Lamb less infectious delta, likely big issue. Well seasonal, cases would much lower people actually took even minor precautions, Americans don‚Äôt moderation. It‚Äôs nothing. X doubt. either never school USA / job homeschooled factory worker. Sincerity irrelevent think delta showing capable infecting high school aged kids. way I‚Äôd open high school without masks right now. conditions change certainly reviewed. lead paragraph:

The U.S. averaging 100,000 new COVID-19 infections day, returning milestone last seen winter surge yet another bleak reminder quickly delta variant spread country.   ironic part wear shoes shirts public. Women wear bras sorts painful things remove hair make attractive, yet masks terrible uncomfortable!!

Nobody ever cried freedom walk around barefoot public. Bras don‚Äôt protect us pathogens, always comfortable, yet half population wears them. there‚Äôs many nuts wanting feel confident enough go way face much backlash. Soon realize could though, change tune, least around here. bunch anti-maskers first, started seeing toll person. know dad one those. still vax he'll wear mask want catch it. Crazy know I've given trying logic point, still thinks vaccine literally poison despite kids vaxxed. can't understand it. It‚Äôs contrarianism. liberals it, it. ok when? Spreadnecks new favorite word. completely agree everything said. Vaccinated, kids aren‚Äôt, wear masks go stay home time. School coming feel like I‚Äôm dying inside. Don‚Äôt forget assholes think ‚Äúknow rights‚Äù don‚Äôt actually know anything constitution law One things boggles mind decided choosing age ranges 5-11 12-18 made sense. That's (mostly) fine got k-6 elementary school 7,8 middle school, many schools moved k-5 6-8 middle school model. means nearly 6th graders schools going starting year unvaccinated. would far better broke age groups kids likely attending school vaccine available time.

Also looking flu vaccine rates state - looks basically identical states best covid vaccine rates (though difference less extreme)   U.S.

I‚Äôm allegedly glad he‚Äôs okay. think always need make distinction countries ability test record cases properly, countries ability. 

So large swathes countries like Albania, Bolivia, Serbia, South Africa, Egypt, etc., sure accuse authorities ""obscuring"" real death toll, likelihood, health system administration simply know real numbers.

On hand, select countries administration healthcare system definitely developed enough keep figures accurate, went lie teeth propaganda purposes, like Russia reporting 110,000 Covid deaths (up April 2021), real numbers period around 500,000.  European here, surely already need valid ID board plane US? 

No. huge pain ass, possible fly without valid ID. Seems like strawman argument honest. That's said though. specifically asked supposed like concept hadnt thought moment. ours. ""whichever comes first"" situation even full approval come November every still required vaccinated. I'm pleased someone working online country can't get vaccinated, I'm happy able refuse. Still say ""for religious reasons"" since non medical option. Apologies, assumed incorrectly. Ha, valid. I'm old enough forget IDs required flying sometimes. new issue, would existing argument guess.

All religious exemptions based around vaccines produced, taking Jansen vaccine (and influenza others) table. mRNA vaccine production process hit points raised religious exemption.

Yes, desperately need vaccinate kids absolutely MNIMAL risk becoming seriously ill COVID. vaccine mutate vaccinated though? clearly still carry spread it. could 100% vaccinated still going exist. smallpox, much contagious.

The vaccine working, ~360 deaths day compared ~3000 covids peak. theatre point. Stop forcing mandates. setting precedents never return from. little unclear what's happening here. sharp spike, sharp drop cases levelled may starting rise again. Without restrictions place shape wave going different previous ones. Regardless vaccination status everyone wearing masks indoors choose congregate. Beyond gathering though cannot sure get Covid. Many likely disagree however. Depends are. places winters get cold, seasonality absolutely contributed October-January spike.

2) risks long covid (whether initial infection symptomatic asymptomatic) fully vaccinated people? chance getting long covid major factor risk tolerance.

We‚Äôre full

Go away &amp; take ur covid think states spared summer Delta surge hit fall winter? higher vaccine intake protect them? Considering lag reporting deaths, death rate reflects relativity low patient load hospitals weeks ago. 

The death rate November quoted also lagging, making much sense. 

Cases exploding similar November last year, deaths. whole point using precautions like masks limit rate spread.

Funny think masks stop spread.

Lockdown closing indoor activities stop spread.

Here live kids going back school caused huge spikes times, regardless permanent, properly enforced mask mandate.


You're also third hospitalization peak, every state Florida Louisiana, well vaccinated states resemble UK, peaked 10% previous hospitalization peak. Eskimo sisters

Off Urban Dictionary go... possible simply immune?


Yes. 

But, far likely asymptomatic case first (or second, maybe third) time exposed, exposed variants, immune system -- ""genetic lottery"" good fighting COVID -- took biological software update.

But... Get vaxxed anyway. Better lucky good lucky. cares people say vaccinines? stupid hype culture adds fuel fire makes political brainer like vaccines. want people rally behind favorite celebs something? that‚Äôs exactly get stubborn people whose minds can‚Äôt changed reason. assuming got covid part really unreasonable. whole year flu common cold barely spreading.

The get tested I'm hook parts stupid.  Lockdown meaningless word unvaccinated keep dieing, number goes own. strike demand it. never said anything mandatory vaccination children, never said benefit children directly. gave additional reasons vaccination beneficial. Additionally, reduction spread also benifets children. Less active cases means less risk children.

Admittedly, impact children seems low, however can't say certainty facts vaccine worth yet know numbers. talking friend Mississippi day. Asked got vaccine yet. said hadn‚Äôt rushed, doesn‚Äôt want put anything body she‚Äôs sure of. 

Says won‚Äôt take Pfizer Moderna doesn‚Äôt want affect RNA (which won‚Äôt that‚Äôs body works), afraid blood clotting J&amp;J vaccine (and knows complication rate people millions).

I try explain she‚Äôs taking bigger risk taking vaccine, she‚Äôs it. ask it‚Äôd take convince vaccine better option. said wants 5 years takes qualify new vaccine. told I‚Äôd talk then. true. outpacing infection rate people recover every day infected. way, total number cases go day coronavirus eventually eliminated. requirements would kill spread overnight, however minimum coronavirus eradicated. way would justify vaccination passports ""morally deplorable?"" still get groceries services curbside pickup. significant inconvenience? Sure. anti-vaxxers make choice, cannot get vaccinated choice. Israel 64% least one dose 59% fully vaccinated. wants magnetic attractiveness. So... would imply Sinovac provides good protection Delta getting beat delta seems case South America like Peru, relies it? gonna one 'intubted covid patient begs vaccine' news stories careful access actual data they're citing? particular point interests timing vaccination vs timing infection. it‚Äôs conservatives African Americans Hispanics far behind white people % vaccinated

At point, considering information mainstream sites (CNN, NPR, others), hell, even FOX pro-vaccination (mostly), reason left stubborn willful stupidity. approach vaccines, everywhere else - many them.

Florida higher vaccination rate. That's we're at. seem unable take NSW's count moderately high restrictions, best race v vaccines, Europe winter.

It's scenario, one we're familiar with, Aus, delta instead alpha variant. ways, stuck trying keep exponential growth down, ways, looking prolonged restrictions roll vaccines.

At most, NSW could ease single week, would result actually take case count far stricter lockdowns currently. would counterproductive - further, would risk rest country, fair portions hardly disrupted year (typing Perth, WA, instance).

Basically, states got us were. Feds managed vaccine rollout. Blame fairly reasonably proportioned knowing two things, imo. Still leave us many options point though - cannot ""live delta"" w/ 15% fully vaccinated rate.

The purpose vaccine prevent exactly that.

A vaccine released three years cannot revive anyone. Can‚Äôt imagine why‚Ä¶ four ~~lights~~claps. Indeed. story FOH guy(sound engineer) got Infected COVID-19 despite vaccinated.

I'm assuming mean bunch teachers left profession states trying force face face teaching vaccine available covid rampant. older teachers want deal online teaching.

Depending age career options might still want go back teaching (which ridiculously underpaid anyway). simply true, data showing immune response reinfection previously infected equal vaccinated, added possibilty immune response exceeds vaccinated  nope, go ahead believe want. you‚Äôre giving lot freedom tiniest securities. fun take it. 95+% hospitalizations people fully vaccinated. That's coincidence. 

If infected, still *much* likely get mild asymptomatic case vaccinated.

Getting vaccinated dramatically reduces chance bad covid outcome. Wait, what? informing parents outbreaks?! assume quarantine procedure?

In low vaccinated environment, approximately 65 million children 15 years old, 150 per week 0.0002% child population. Even full year level exposure would result 1 death per 10,000 kids.

Again, making light loss children, hope soon vaccines available whole population. hard keep rational head confronted terrible thought 150 children dying per week unless put context. haven‚Äôt heard anyone personally, no.

The constitution bill rights 90 days today, cowboy. Nothing gonna change. Thank goodness still judges willing act. conveniently US hit 50% vaccination, math many breakthrough remarkably easy. ""Approximately 0.04% fully vaccinated people U.S. reported breakthrough cases, according researchers."" quick google reveals versus 35 million cases (10%) unvaccinated meaning vaccines stop right around 99% cases.

now assume right 94/4/2 numbers breakthrough non-breakthrough cases raise number breakthrough cases factor 250 (so would equal number vaccinated cases) would get exactly number mild, serious infections, deaths.

comparing apples apples easy one apple 250 times better other. First dose protection Moderna touch higher, advantage you‚Äôre getting vaxxed Delta rampaging. Side effects may worse (usually second dose) dose size larger. Numbers six months pretty comparable Pfizer.

For dose size ‚Äî remember hearing Moderna higher starting point, &amp; trials realized could smaller dose. want re-start trials 

Back January, US officials even considered splitting Moderna doses half speed rollout.  guess specific, then. link say anything say does, generally, way oversimplify, insurance cost determined cost healthcare pool jumping into. idea everyone paying care may need, need getting subsidized everyone else pool.

if reach really hard, guess could say keeping insurance companies denying coverage based pre-existing conditions, ACA passing cost dumb decisions everybody else that's insurance works.

i figured making argument, misses fundamental piece ACA slowed increase insurance premiums. conservative media years really focused cases insurance plans provided little coverage longer met requirements health insurance increase offered, increased cost mostly useless plans. reality, [the ACA slowed growth premium costs and, average, lowered premiums already constant moaning ACA right, [it continues program overall much good average americans pre-ACA status oversimplify, considerably healthy people paying insurance systems taking much out. keeping cycle going slows rate premium growth, suck healthy person paying really taking out, ideally benefits everyone age needing care.

it's economy scale concept put observable practice, also many left advocate medicare-for-all approach. make lot sense everyone paying separate pools also vie attention, introduces cost healthcare system nothing actually providing healthcare. put everyone pool, pay considerably less per person also ensuring every time need kind healthcare, costs subsidized provider longer decide insurance providers they're going work with.

one factors seems missed see pre-existing condition requirement pushing cost bad decisions onto people make generally good healthcare decisions paying bad decisions anyway, they're much costly deal with. [this seems pretty light read preventative care cheaper curative encouraging preventative care, ACA aims keep people emergency rooms, considerably expensive taxing healthcare system. 

when someone admitted emergency care, cannot initially turned away, get treatment regardless whether they're insured. cost care covered somebody, hospitals increase cost treatment general compensate. hospitals increase cost treatment, insurance increase cost premiums. since larger insurers for-profit, publicly traded entities, obligation shareholders everything reasonably deliver growth. creates feedback loop sees premiums going year year.

the healthcare system united states stupid, parasitic entity reason apply standard economic principles to, despite fact healthcare commodity people walk away from, removes key piece makes markets work. however, way think stupid line reality shows complete lack understanding works. hope helps least little bit. great news. guess I'm willing get third vaccination long safe vampires ofc. someone lying effectiveness vaccines what?
I'm loss. shit seems never ending. depressing fuck. Thinking audition. got vaccinated today. Thank everyone posts valuable information vaccine. anti-vax rhetoric Facebook, would gotten it. Keep sharing useful, factual information everyone drown conspiracy theories! Except opinion gets people killed. might way get fully vaccinated: ‚Äúif demand doesn‚Äôt rise, start shipping unused vaccine allotment large Muslim county populated minorities really wants them‚Äù. :O Excuse Robert Bobby people got different vaccine? leave die Delta variant? got Pfizer told ‚Äúthe effective Covid vaccine‚Äù, fucking liars. Creating caste system based got ‚Äúbest‚Äù vaccine isn‚Äôt step forward, it‚Äôs two steps backwards creates inequality world.

I'm sure value vaccine passports are, evidence seems increasing vaccinated people catch spread Delta variant rates similar unvaccinated people. (Vaccines appear still preventing hospitalization worse quite effectively, much worth getting, course.) 

Do want system place allows vaccinated people ""risky"" things like traveling congregating indoors circumstances?

Aside huge technical problems implementing programs successfully preventing fraud counterfeiting render pointless, may idea whose time come gone reasons. think discussion available research rather mentioning all. 
Obviously want kids die fatality important measure long term damage organs considered well long covid. 

We may know vaccines prevent long covid breakthrough infection vaccines prevent kids getting covid first place.

Honestly, mostly understand Pfizer start larger numbers participants beginning study. would assume FDA communicates vaccine researchers could let know would looking larger groups barring that, vaccine researchers could anticipated concerns. they? think conspiracy, truly wonder reasoning. People lining participate since trials enrolling. still turning people away ""fully enrolled"" studies. 

I'm vaccine researcher part FDA really understand intricacies process. kept listening meeting waiting level headed professionals speak mention concerns. didn't.  no, ""99%"" completely bullshit statistic apply everybody. bigger are, weaker immune system preexisting pulmonary condition cardiovascular issues get worse without vaccine. really goes show little care directly effect you. Well done. keep head sand want Delta doesn‚Äôt give shit strange, I'm vaccinated believe science way shape form vaccine mandates. vaccine may prevent one catching covid, significantly reduce symptoms likelihood ending hospital. want live life vaccine-less, fine me, however .5% end hospital larger unknown % people end long term health problems; bet sweet ass zero empathy avoided getting shot principal. know risk, let people make choices. Thank you, friend! absolutely broke heart make decision. ultimately choice.

I, along many colleagues, suicidal facing daily basis. I‚Äôm simply blessed position able retire.

I feel friends colleagues aren‚Äôt community large leadership cannot take care it.

Congratulations Kingdom Bhutan!! great unrecognized sin unnecessary trauma Americans placing health care workers.

And people infected chose get vaccinated (the unvaccinated take vaccinated them) whose healthcare otherwise delayed. Based local news local hospital news conferences, non-COVID care anyone else might need impacted. Choosing get vaccinated ramifications others. Nobody denies conspiracy theory existed exists never reddit supported morons oppose vaccine now. course people listening science too, vast majority people anti vaxxers fall nonsense. idiots like ex president suckered though.  Thank you! I‚Äôve read articles hospitals able find nurses even offering bonuses. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs staffing levels. Thank you, one year chemo far good. Im sorry hear daughter.

It's still lazy journalism use full pandemic death toll, misleading result same. Why? really public health you, want punish anti-vaxxers?  Bet it. wage war expensive machines lives risk retaliation bunch people pose enemy flood social media insane conspiracies hateful messages. wind sit back let destroy inside. number Oregonians hospitalized COVID-19 skyrocketed past month, rising faster previous waves almost entirely among number Oregonians hospitalized COVID-19 skyrocketed past month, rising faster previous waves almost entirely among unvaccinated.

Hospital leaders say COVID-positive patients requiring hospitalization younger average ever before. quicker onset symptoms, patients ill admitted hospitals rapidly declining health compared previous surges.

On Friday, number people hospitalized COVID-19 reached 496, including record 135 intensive care. current trajectory, Oregon pace exceed all-time high 584 COVID-positive patients soon next week.

But hospital leaders Gov. Kate Brown sounded alarm, earlier waves. Brown warned June 2020 ‚Äì 108 people hospitalized COVID-19 ‚Äì hospitals ‚Äúcould overwhelmed‚Äù within weeks based modeling. Brown renewed restrictions November ‚Äì 285 people hospitalized ‚Äì saying hospitals could withstand surge ‚Äúthat needs last resort.‚Äù April ‚Äì 328 people hospitalized ‚Äì Brown restored restraints rising hospitalizations ‚Äúthreatening overwhelm doctors nurses.‚Äù

The reasons dire warnings capacity concerns haven‚Äôt returned summer appear three-fold: vaccines readily available known dramatically reduce need hospitalization, healthcare providers shifted focus pushing people vaccinated; current hospital surge largely spared Portland area ‚Äî hospitals developed ways better manage hospital capacity ‚Äî giving state extra buffer sick patients; governor handed COVID-19 safeguards individual counties, local leaders reluctant institute communities feeling worn-out given green light weeks ago.

‚ÄúThree four weeks line, there‚Äôs concern here, that‚Äôs also point, somebody went today got vaccinated, they‚Äôre going sick,‚Äù said Erik Robinson, spokesperson Oregon Health &amp; Science University. ‚ÄúWe need people vaccinated.‚Äù

Oregon‚Äôs governor largely taken hands-off approach current wave, deferring county officials implement restrictions slow spread since lifted statewide restrictions June 30. far, county acted, although hospital systems voluntarily postponed non-emergency procedures manage capacity.

Brown ‚Äúincredibly concerned increase COVID-19 hospitalizations,‚Äù spokesperson Charles Boyle said email earlier week.

‚ÄúLocal leaders asked local control therefore expect local leaders areas impacted COVID-19 take action,‚Äù Boyle added. ‚ÄúAll options remain table hospitalizations continue rise.‚Äù

The summer spike left healthcare providers scratching heads vaccine hesitancy resistance, options aside continuing push shots single effective way prevent hospitalization death COVID-19. 70% eligible Oregonians least partially vaccinated, leaving 1 million people without shots.

‚ÄúWe ‚Ä¶ promote vaccination community,‚Äù said Dr. Katie Sharff, infectious disease doctor Kaiser Permanente. ‚ÄúBut don‚Äôt mitigation measures place, continue see community transmission, continue see people get sick, continue see people hospitalized. feeds problem capacity.‚Äù

Meanwhile, pool unvaccinated people state tends younger, delta variant contagious shows severe effects, said Gary Walker, spokesperson Providence Health &amp; Services.

‚ÄúThe difference they‚Äôre younger, sicker, quicker,‚Äù Walker said people hospitalized.

Prior Fourth July holiday Providence Portland Medical Center days zero patients intensive care COVID-19, said Sabra Bederka, ICU nurse hospital. Encouraged decline patients, Bederka medical staff spoke believed state plans officially reopen ‚Äúa terrible idea,‚Äù said, even though Oregon among last states nationally so. ‚ÄúAnd clearly right, unfortunately.‚Äù

‚Äú‚ÄòIt‚Äôs OK take precautions,‚Äô basically heard government,‚Äù said. ‚Äú‚ÄòMask want to, mask haven‚Äôt gotten vaccinated.‚Äô People aren‚Äôt going pay attention that. basically forced right thing, that‚Äôs heartbreaking. get mad they‚Äôre told right thing it‚Äôs right right thing.‚Äù

When Bederka last work days ago, said, none COVID-positive patients ICU vaccinated. ‚ÄúThis surge unvaccinated,‚Äù said.

‚ÄúThere 100% guarantee anything, wear mask, get vaccine, very, very, very, high chance getting sick all,‚Äù said. ‚ÄúOr you, heaven forbid, get sick, it‚Äôs very, mild.‚Äù

As Friday, summer surge officially pushed hospitalizations COVID-positive patients metro region past spring peak, remain half height fall.

Portland surrounding counties also considerably smaller share COVID-positive hospitalizations fall ‚Äî previously claiming around half statewide total third.

Meanwhile, summer spike particularly acute southern Oregon. hospital region covers Jackson Josephine counties record 100 patients COVID-19 Friday.

The Asante health system recorded 80% patients across three hospitals Medford, Ashland Grants Pass. ‚ÄúWe operating capacity many weeks,‚Äù said spokesperson Lauren Van Sickle.

She added 90% Asante‚Äôs COVID-positive patients vaccinated.

Hospitals Portland region often taking seriously ill COVID-positive patients across Oregon. region Friday recorded 47 people intensive care, already spring peak, 18 people short fall high.

As state‚Äôs academic medical center, OHSU taking critically ill complex cases, said Dr. David Zonies, OHSU associate chief medical officer critical care. Providence also taken COVID-positive patients southern Oregon, Washington, Idaho, California Montana flown helicopter Portland, Bederka said.

As Friday, Oregon reported hospitals Portland region operating 95% capacity, 89 available non-ICU beds. Capacity intensive care stood 87%, 44 available beds.

The summer surge increased anxiety among health care workers battered 17 months pandemic. Hospitals nationwide continue face staff shortages, many leaving profession pandemic.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think anyone truly anticipating summer surge,‚Äù Zonies said. ‚ÄúWe really focused happens go back indoors fall.‚Äù

Zonies said frustrating part hospitalization surge avoidable, people vaccinated. said hospital seeing critically ill patients ages 20 40 unvaccinated, although state data show three dozen Oregonians age groups died entire pandemic nearly 2,900 total deaths.

‚ÄúThe narrative doesn‚Äôt affect young doesn‚Äôt jibe longer, that‚Äôs makes scary,‚Äù said.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs scare tactic. stark, cold reality,‚Äù added. ‚ÄúPeople need really understand that‚Äôs is. need encourage, need firm, need people engage community keep us safe.‚Äù

Even so, seems expectation pandemic ending premature. still appear hope vaccinated cases far less severe update vaccines utilize boosters event new strain, relatively simple ending many (myself included) hoping appears dubious now.

This fine   Partner, smallpox vaccine came out, wasn‚Äôt Q anon, everything wasn‚Äôt overly political

You need read 20s Klan far dangerous force Qultists ever fact governors like Kemp DeSantis never mandate vaccines school children they‚Äôll lose election.

Polling finds decision say mask thing schools deeply unpopular reply conspiracy polling please spare de facto mandate schools, businesses, employers may work places like Cali, Massachusetts, Hawaii. here.

Tide already shifting that, 59% Florida example already minimum first dose vaccinated increasingly GOP politicians coming favor vaccination. don‚Äôt call morons dude. catch flies honey vinegar.

Morons far generous description anyone would kill people getting vaccine crazy fringe way far gone caught anything. abut sane people moving without them. federal government works. wait majority States start enforcing mandates issue sort federal response cowardly make right decision everyone country.

Same thing happening legalization Marijuana. Damn man. really sorry loss. wish could give internet hug. Thank service. o7   Bit slippery slope argument there, no?

""I support mass vaccinations, hey, throwing anti-vaxxers fire works, support too!""

It's pretty big leap assume someone favor mandatory vaccinations would also support ""literally measures"". Viruses really energy. They're barely considered living things Obesity contagious. problem whatsoever wearing mask even vaccinated surges. really don‚Äôt understand pushback masks obviously must minority that. severe symptoms? It‚Äôs well known vaccine either prevent illness entirely or, get sick, you‚Äôll rapidly get better. opposed hospitalized dying.  die? Aha! vaccines work.

Unfortunately pretty fat UK :( wouldn‚Äôt tell overweight friend lose weight like wouldn‚Äôt tell skinny friend aren‚Äôt getting heart rate enough week, eating much cholesterol much fried food. 


The reason might considered fat shaming someone says encouraging healthy lifestyle means fat people. aren‚Äôt talking health, you‚Äôre focusing one part, weight. 

Doctors, scientist, nutritionist, FDA, school, federal government encouraging healthier lifestyles that‚Äôs people coming from. I‚Äôm saying govt can‚Äôt enforce vaccine mandate sizable chunk population armed willing resist. PART CONTINGENT. people ‚Äúmy neck woods‚Äù would take kindly people inquiring vaccine status. household fully vaccinated 100% adult population. No, unfortunately misinformation.

No vaccine, vaccine history ever perfect.

All greatly, greatly, greatly reduce chances negative things, like spreading, getting, getting sick, etc.

There would still rare cases people polio vaccine spread disease someone else, much like individuals COVID vaccines passing someone else.

But rate greatly reduced.

People say ‚Äúyou still spread it!‚Äù equal chance action, it‚Äôs equal.  cases, paying tests? act like trust FDA government entities telling get vaccine. trusted science, experts getting vaccine. understood risks, listened experts risks, even tried good faith risk assessment getting vaccine. act like science risk assessment side.  Government infringement think. Trump thing all. goes way beyond that. yet almost 30% adults, including 3,5 million age 60 refuse take it. Germany serious antivaxxer problem. company walking eggshells polling showed huge fraction population would happily look work elsewhere company continue work-from-home arrangement.

I think pretty interesting! Huh, it‚Äôs showing one reason. I‚Äôm trying figure copy paste text article phone you. It‚Äôs looking good Canada  generalizes Christian Nationalists, important movement anymore occidental countries, exclusive US evangelicals, talking Christian Nationalists instead Evangelical Nationalists generalization.
Not religious nationalism anyway better, wanted specify supidity seem apply them, change. Martyrs.. heroes get pizza parties /s don‚Äôt deny science. chair getting vaccine first day available me. Masks may help controlled study, everybody careless private. last 18 months proof pudding.

That‚Äôs good point. patriot would knocking door get vaccine good country. Covid like modern flu, hence requires powerful vaccines tackle, boosters..the thing make covid harmless multiple easily available treatments, pharmaceutical firms working anti viral pills, I'm highly skeptical well they'll work lot public health officials detached. patients become numbers spreadsheet. 

Dr. Paul Offit said Doctor Radio (episode 257, 10-11 minutes show) didn‚Äôt need talking booster shots ‚Äú10, 15, 20%‚Äù hospitalization deaths breakthrough cases. 

I flabbergasted. would think need booster shots get 10-20%. DON‚ÄôT get 10-20%.  We've short staffed post covid burnout nursing home now. antivax cna came work spread hall full blown outbreak. lot grumbling discontent already I'm worried we'll lose staff burnout illness. We're barely functioning take much knock house cards. 

The death chaos bad enough dealing 16 hour shifts 80+ hour weeks top end sight. balls wall entire shift. break charting shoving food face loading screens. anymore someone clarified talking mandates federal level. Thanks though  Buddha condone military juntas . Lol you‚Äôre troll!    know 70% gotten vaccine, fail see 30% group 70% breakthroughs said. region prides call morons saying conservative thing. 

And anyone thinks D's fully behind vaccine needs rethink. see point agree dangers frustration must whole heartedly disagree totalitarian reaction person's right decide happens body. 

To give perspective, immunodeficient. fortunate could get vaccine still need practice extreme caution really dependent cluster immunity around me. understand danger anti-vax pose frustrated sad people would gladly put others risk misinformation. However, choice. choice want make defend right choose. flu shot, measles, polio, Pneumococcal, Tetanus, Hepatitis, Mumps Hib vaccines mandatory then? They‚Äôre still free get appointment every day work! Awfully morbid thinking I'm surprised got upvoted. Usually say recent surge American south cause huge amount hospitalizations smaller expected death tolls get downvoted oblivion. 

Then again, degenerates hoping NYC Early 2020 type surge south finally cancel embarrassment NE still highest deaths per capita political reasons.  J&amp;J still infinitely better vaccinated! push hard think there's chance may change mind get vaccinated all.

Glad hear another person choosing get vaccinated!

Everything that‚Äôs supposed smell bad carries scent. also can‚Äôt taste coffee anymore. Fuck Covid man. studies show vaccinated people get sick viral load may similar unvaccinated. However, chance vaccinated person getting infected still much lower therefore chance viral load lower well. plays *the boys back town*  data Delta variant showed up. I'm asking forever ignore potential misuse. I'm trying narrow variables try understand there's anything disclosing vaccination status problematic potential abuses problem you.

So, yes, sake conversation describe like vaccination status *other* potential abuses. 

I'm sure what's weird that.  Yeah, sad see many communities working hard beat virus, yet many places dropping ball. SE Michigan got hit hard B.17 last winter Vaccines widely available. mass demand rolled tell that. mother Alzheimer‚Äôs, suspected beginning outbreak. went isolation March 2020, Memory Care July 2020. place taken incredible care everyone, part means I‚Äôve seen twice past year. Even residents cleared visit broadly family go visits site, still kept dementia patients pretty firmly isolated insight this. 

This saw last years mother‚Äôs life panning out, are.  also fine jail complying. Basically anything except forcibly inject you. enjoy irony whining karma another thread, simultaneously brag friends ready ‚Äúexercise second amendment rights‚Äù anyone tries mandate vaccine. got curious Texas law since Abbot keeps going unlawful mandatory mask vaccines are. went texas orders maks mandates. fucker suspend half health emergency laws rightfully passed Texas executive orders. 

I get executive orders place quickly instate laws huge reach nullify many laws people Texas passed allow people die. Thank much reply. seems leaning towards Johnson Johnson one it‚Äôs one shot. still good choice try push towards Moderna Pfizer? Sadly jobs start mandating vaccines across board it'll almost impossible reach number. 

Fortunately, seems employers finally figured out, along coming realization business operations never same/how want unless get vaccination rate up. full FDA approval comes, think expect dam break torrent new even make incentives like unemployment welfare eligibility prove vaccine status.

I hesitant put strings social programs like this, particular case agree. long Social Security Another good one would another stimulus check people get jab.

I'm supportive this, something tells Republicans would never let Imagine every door restaurant public building opened held up-to-date vaccine card scanner. would great. 

This going happen limited degree--and quite automated--very quickly. Nice restaurants NY, SF, LA, Chi already this. Even Minneapolis, I've seen restaurants tweeting considering system.

Unfortunately, think move needle vax, people eat types places rules generally little overlap anti-vaxxers. vaccine readily available anyone age 12.

Get vaccine get vaccine risk getting entirely nobody else.

I'm responsible health mine.

I recommend everyone get vaccine I'm going force people. One day. 140 millions russians revolt government fall one day. Meanwhile need guts totally topic. six decades, EEOC still says required start analysis, even vaccines. Refusing analysis means pay crazy lawyer handsomely. 

And going cases unvaccinated alter risk *your business.* 

The hard cases anti-vax people already COVID. greater risk, vaccine. 

100% remote work home? risk business, regardless vaccine status.  Again, I‚Äôm arguing obesity isn‚Äôt issue. I‚Äôm saying discussions advice come health professionals, friends might might know they‚Äôre talking about. blood transfusion cure something contagious? something would save one person's life. That's difference. getting vaccinated affecting one person making choice. affects everyone. ""The study provides evidence immunity triggered SARS-CoV-2 infection extraordinarily long-lasting. Adding good news, ‚Äúthe implications vaccines durable effect‚Äù, says Menno van Zelm, immunologist Monash University Melbourne, Australia.""

The durable effect...

""Ellebedy‚Äôs team tracked antibody production 77 people recovered mostly mild cases COVID-19. expected, SARS-CoV-2 antibodies plummeted four months infection. decline slowed, 11 months infection, researchers could still detect antibodies recognized SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.""

Suggests infection immunity last longer considering vaccinations looking ta biannual shots never said were.

Many others adopting less sweeping ‚Äî perhaps conspicuous ‚Äî approaches, including mask mandates unvaccinated workers requirement work remotely.  forced. They're going compromise accept things longer able do. putting people risk, that's price pay. claim it, I'm saying far data suggests immunity diminishes time. answers question, yes infected ppl get vaccinated 

The former US President got vaccinated days recovering, advised so, unlikely bc infection (which nearly killed him) deemed sufficient. But‚Ä¶ people infect friends may may vaccinated.

Keep mind Florida absolute shit testing reporting accurate information, always give week two trying grab sort trends case death numbers know long term effects similar vaccines, long term effects Covid (potentially permanent lung damage potentially 25% patients). Long Covid really scary, guaranteed far scary vaccine ever is. Wear mask, avoid crowds, hang tight. You‚Äôre almost there. counties, atypical rising trend. 90% issue, normally 70, rising 5% week, major problem. complications occur vaccine administered it‚Äôs ‚Äúunknown‚Äù vaccine cause. sure reason lives saved lmao hella contagious

People little math get sense Delta's R0 6 means compared Alpha's R0 3. Plus Delta shorter cycle time day so, 3 days vs 4 days. 

Over two weeks, get 6^5 vs 3^4. That's 7776 vs 81. That's almost *two orders magnitude*. holy crap.

Even health care capabilities handle Alpha scale surge, Delta capable dropping 100 times patients short period time.  Hermit-itis.  seriously, everyone different risk profiles talk population risk can‚Äôt really quantify specific individual‚Äôs risk. simply many variables . protests last summer studied found superspreader events, protestors overwhelmingly masked people living cities protests laid low weeks suspected protests could lead increased viral circulation.

In case, extent superspreader events, that‚Äôs blood hands police. stay house then. I‚Äôm going continue live life. good day. Wow, speaking empathy-less, *we read comment history*.  anomalies reporting testing anomalies inaccuracies. Like Chinas total deaths, India‚Äôs case count anything Russia. 

Western non China Asian countries accurate data review.   Sugarland?!?! vaccine waivers religious grounds actually based laws state state basis instead federal level.

A power given restricted state otherwise assumed states.

So patchwork.

Some states grant based religion, philosophical waiver (which also covers religion - would easiest abuse related covid). states regulate waivers also based age, particular vaccine, particular disease vaccination targets (for instance HPV)

Here WebMD's quick explainer religious exemptions. National Converence State Legislators gives complete depth explainer (and even lists state regualtions examples) wishes.

It complex thing tackle 50 states take matter.  miss point completely Covid. like people downplaying virus.

In case bother, : Long Covid. 

Somewhere 15% - 30% covid infections lead long covid unpleasant symptoms many months. people got infected 9 months ago still breathing issues, tastes issues, brain fog, etc.

Yeah, death rare. Long covid not. Imagine 15% whole fricken planet kind problems due one single virus.

That's war Covid going right sane people best protect populations.  Remember told us last year heat kills virus Florida would largely unaffected?

Lol Trash  That's actually great way put it. make comments  No

SARS-CoV-2 Lambda Variant Remains Susceptible Neutralization mRNA Vaccine-elicited Antibodies Convalescent That's asked though. I'm debating counting correctly. I'm asking valid evidence show people help make case, relevant. high schools, I‚Äôd say current case numbers, mandate now, wave peaks numbers start going again, talk safe exit strategy would acceptable. 

For elementary middle schools, I‚Äôd say keep full year, since earliest shot would available would late Winter Early Spring. dunno Cousins religious reasons sounds similar sentiment I've heard religious people. Let repeat: early vaccinated person, must tell want convince laggards, avoid appearance excluding bits might weaken case, fucking simple math favor. emboldens morons. State facts, especially ones may appear blunt point case. Chrissakes, recheck math. simple fact misstated actual % *in favor* disservice case. Lol guys ‚ÄúI took vaccine government told good I‚Äôm better you‚Äù attitude. whatever want, freedom put something body feel make safer. ask respect freedom don‚Äôt force something don‚Äôt feel safe body.

Exactly kind place don‚Äôt want relying pinky promises self-regulation It‚Äôs rare though. reinfection common Covid numbers would never go down. That‚Äôs immunology works. sub however would believe reinfected countless times die. low-risk group prior vaccine. Even lower risk it. I‚Äôll risk 4 days mild flu symptoms locked house summer. Great data! Interestingly, Moderna total deaths even though fewer people vaccinated it. (Page 9 document) numbers deaths probably small tell us Pfizer protective death, gives hope might worse Moderna front. feel owned yet. Maybe could speed process little. Oh wait, school starts soon. need patient. Hug know YET. Yet part I'm sure concerns people. 100 million people (generic big number) vaccines concern long term effects. can't know long term yet. far worst covid wave USA see. 50% unvaccinated (150+ million). Maybe 20-30million people recovered covid. leaves 120 million people vulnerable variant spreads 100% faster. see, yes counting correctly. That‚Äôs bothered most, nonchalance. callous attitude. tells small fraction story. vaccinated person‚Äôs body going beat hell virus quickly, return going viral load likely filled dead‚Äô (layman term) virus. would greatly reduce spread, studies UK, Israel, Singapore showing vaccinated person reduction transmission, especially rest community highly vaxxed. it‚Äôs important hit high threshold vaccinations community. It‚Äôll make outbreaks would normally turn surges fizzle turning virus endemic.

Follow sailorrooscout Twitter knowledgeable simple information regarding vaccines also avoids fear mongering we‚Äôre seeing media‚Äôs headlines.

We‚Äôve luckily slammed concerts, many sound guys left industry lot places trouble staffing shows. know lot bigger production companies dipped smaller smaller shows NEVER would done somewhat survive. Like companies 20k person shows shows 500 person range. I‚Äôve gone back refusing work indoor shows, really hoping able since it‚Äôs god damn 105+ heat index time. It‚Äôs shitty shitty year lot people. Really happy live nation announced artists set vaccine/negative test requirements shows. Good luck fellow industry bud. Generally, medical dosing divided &lt;6 years (occasionally &lt;4), 6-11, 12+. &lt;6 almost always weight-based dosing, 6-11 often set dose, 12+ higher set dose, typically dose adults. can't promise reasoning vaccine companies, would track accepted medical standards Imo start naming Pok√©mon run Greek letters go again, gunna another wild ride COVID-19. Correct. athlete dedicate whole life early childhood best it. eat well, work make good choices (unless naturally gifted course) throw away. what? Nah misread calculation. Noticed almost immediately deleted comment. Still 4% pretty big fucking deal. can‚Äôt blame parents wanting child‚Äôs first introduction school uncertain, inconsistent, stressful like many places.  Dangerous territory. So, many take get severely sick die change minds? Again, virus proves selfish people are.   We're talking religion rejects modern advances. I'm sure people wanting force things going good guys. guys wear masks arrived? show one reports says natural stronger. Never seen one.  ones still left laugh vaccinated people drop dead it. suppose possible - animal reservoir camels, contact them, likely. never openly transmitting population (at least medical community never documented it). speculation asymptomatic cases Stop posting scare articles rhinoviruses.   adult population citizen.  catch vaccine panel meeting June precipitated 4-6 months follow-up data recommendation?  many people making case COVID vaccines even qualify EUA children because, population, children affected COVID badly adults. believe Delta's hyper-transmissibility going change that. yet unclear cases going severe children, think clear, largely unvaccinated population, going see much higher case numbers children. 

Here's hot take. FDA want grant EUA w/ 2 months follow-up data, even data shows vaccines safe effective, allow open enrollment clinical trials. 1) light natural infection 2) reading south china morning post early last year said antibodies natural infection lasted months. seems planning use serum recovered patients help sick people decided worth effort scale up. Technically correct doesn‚Äôt mean misleading lmao  still antiVa continue rant ""rare"" problems virus.

¬†First think big difference ""anti Vax"" 'vax hesitant"" relayed article. 

The ""anti vax"" crazies decade longer right ""flat earthers"" there's talking them. enough cards deck.

The group seems generally ant ""THIS vax"" FDA approval long term studies like vaccines. millions taken mean issue road. Like said first comment many drugs got FDA approval pulled went general population problems. happens theres issue 2 years? much larger group open issues. downvote disagree button friend.

I understand points, I'm antivaxer, hell I'm provaxer throw away hours antivaxer listen try get people realize one pushing conspiracy fuck world nefarious medical procedures. 

I get little uneasy government talks mandating things. like precedent sets. Remember Whitehouse? right covid vaccinations still yet fully approved FDA, feel like least wait mandates.

I also understand groups victimized US establishment may wary it.

Again, love vaccines, I'm glad could get them. greatly reduce risk infect another person. stop spread less likely get infected all. get infected, difference likelihood spreading it. ....and 21% deaths last 7 days, 28% deaths   I‚Äôm mad tax sugary drinks Seattle.

Life moving yet yes tired SIDS contagious.    Yeah, it‚Äôs super frustrating remember health experts back March 2020 going ‚ÄúCoronaviruses mutate slowly.‚Äù Yeah Doc, knew hundreds millions people going inevitably get it, we‚Äôd mutation every month practically.  assholish response someone saying want protect kids. 

You knowledge person‚Äôs medical history ‚Äúrisk assessment‚Äù could completely wrong don‚Äôt necessary information. hard give away free medicine. God damn. Getting vaccinated reduces chances getting infected reduces severity disease infected. See /u/goug20 's reply below, good writeup documentation--long story short, sounds like big concern.


As far I'm aware supply remotely issue.  vials expiring, stuff given away countries.  walk-in vaccination almost pharmacy point.  also, look switch kind thing completely ignore horrible way die Covid. like slowly drowning, everything hurts inflammation. Yep. Delta different beast. Wish people would understand this. Lambda creeping up. chose Vax, turn away. answers. They'll figure out.  sad see people Australia learn mistakes countries. able isolate days late contain outbreak. People selfish stupid. Every major city US hosting sold baseball games 3-4 nights week. cancelling baseball?  year

Sometimes can't believe long going for. flu once. another time. times. Yes, could say diseases. Why? doesn‚Äôt matter , still almost dead unvaxxed mean severe symptoms, yes. seem transmissible children adults. transmission, greater rate virus mutation. Good info!  also good hear much concern led believe.  Section bias.  aware this. Good know. doesn‚Äôt matter. Even vaccines weren‚Äôt available still makes unvaxxed It‚Äôs unvaccinated individual show they‚Äôve negative test need pay find free. 

It‚Äôs companies way saying get vaccinated.  covid never going away, live like disease.   *Darius Slay entered chat.*

Yeah! Fuck grandma kids medical conditions! Survival fittest!

üôÑ Florida Department Health announced last month would longer release daily COVID-19 data. Instead, releasing weekly report every Friday, withholds information publicly available before.

As June 4, state longer reports non-resident vaccinations, coronavirus cases fatalities. state declined repeated requests provide non-resident data Tampa Bay Times.

WTF?  lol not. world hunger, income inequality, climate change - ‚Äúgetting info comment section‚Äù attitude *literally* source problems? no. It‚Äôs green energy‚Äôs fault  mean like Sturgis Motorcycle Rally CDC identified 2020 responsible outbreaks neighbouring states? hope right. There‚Äôs total 36 million reported covid cases. 330 million people. 36*5=180 million people actually got covid; still leaves 150 million people haven‚Äôt gotten it. 50% people unvaccinated; 75 million vulnerable people still exist. enough people massively over-run hospitals may practice triage eventually. work great soviets. also atheist done wrong christianity, way dude. Religious belief problem. problem people charge institutions get power hungry. Power corrupts. Source(s) please? could see degenerate corner case true like ""infection delta variant better current vaccines preventing (re-)infection specifically delta variant"" obviously still want vaccinated prior initial exposure. mean, dying delta 100% effective way prevent re-infection too, make smart. Sure. I'm doctor nurse even scientist. rando internet, I'll share know. Here's CDC Shingrix vaccine page, definitely read this: Shingles vaccine everybody regardless remember chickenpox not. couple exceptions eligible Shingrix vaccine, exceptions CDC webpage follows:

* severely allergic vaccine component
* severely allergic Shingrix 1st dose
* tested negative varicella zoster, get chickenpox vaccine instead
* currently shingles
* currently pregnant breastfeeding

Shingrix like Moderna / Pfizer vaccine two dose vaccine, instead 3/4 weeks, 2 6 month gap jabs. Right now, current recommendation Shingrex lifetime / 2 dose regime. recommendation may change researchers see decrease immunity road (say like 20 years whatever).

I really encourage read CDC page details! 

The partner feeling much better today. last symptoms wrapped Thursday night / Friday day. got 2nd shot 2 regime Friday. felt little meh Monday Thursday week. think ran small fever first 1-2 days, bloody hot right now, got dehydrated electrolytes wack. Put Gatorade Ibuprofen perked up. upset people get vaccinated trying remain empathetic fact people died misinformed, tragedy. 

I wish government would finally realize misinformation problem addressed effective form Fauci say something people tuned last year. Teaching simple sounds requires lot effort well. I've seen far many kids career switch homeschooling come back year two parent handle it. school blamed kid that's behind, etc. Etc. get wrong, certainly folks capable homeschooling communities make easier, reason good teachers short supply. Good teaching difficult much complicated reading script random book buy. I'm assuming troll post claiming every single Covid infection United States caught positive test. Chinese vaccines largely effective identified variants. countries used extensively giving mRNA shots booster give better protection. point there‚Äôs really legitimate cause concern variant. Considering much infectious Delta is, Lambda may entirely superseded point. house, serve guacamole. 
- Tacos 24:7 
 
As house, serve tacos. 
- Salsa 24:7 heard read anything saying contagious delta studies data points saying might possibly evade vaccines. Even looking Nextstrain shows portion sequenced cases, delta dominates everywhere detected. see lambda outcompeted. Delta beast vaccines still providing good protection serious illness death. trade-off selected virus doesn‚Äôt spread pre-symptomatically. 

**Covid spreads pre-symptomatically.** saw Twitter thread yesterday guy pointing lot anti-vax, pro trump protesters organizers people imdb profiles websites actors looking work kinda hints anti-vax stuff astroturfing.

Edit: many paywalls articles, half time bother clicking more.    Well, also mode fight disease think absolutely every positive case went get tested recorded? CDC thinks 4x many got covid‚Ä¶scroll estimated   evidence Covid reinfection China reported Asian newspapers early last year fully hit US downplayed. 

Also, testing consistently shown vaccine response many times stronger natural response. Natural response varies wildly depending bad initial viral load was. definitely automatically give person neutralizing immunity.  can't opt reality surrounded larger human population.

During 2014 measles outbreak community Ohio large number Amish get vaccinated. 

Apparently tend get tetanus vaccines too.

On whole vaccination seems ""preference to"" diammetrical religious anathema.

But even were, can't opt reality there's contact commerce - even island nations used power government data isolate entirely successful. Things way complicated spring (before vaccines readily available). 

I four festivals planned fall (kicking Labor Day). know decision making process right now. easier everyone unvaccinated (or people). Now, large contingent people vaccinated, see companies (and governments) putting together basic safety plan, going full-send.

I'm little angry nationwide vaccine passport (even opt-in). card shows vaccinated seems easy fake. would 100% fine vaccinated (or people valid heath reason can't be), attending large events Covid numbers drop again.

At point, feel like there's bunch people done right thing. socially distanced, wore mask, got vaccinated. There's smaller group complained (and continue so). wish they'd understand value public health, refuse punished poor decisions. Oh HR already looking that. Return Work plan constantly morphing due labor market telling us. 

That said flat lying HR still poor solution get wfh. I‚Äôd rather tell employer I‚Äôm comfortable coming point job market far employee‚Äôs favor moment. course company labeled essential time get wfh I‚Äôm quarantined. hope right. intersection ignorant athlete hometown team vexing thing navigate ; come back common sense : reason get vaccinated. motivations bring people anti vax stance. motivations really place team dynamic ‚Ä¶selfish players tend move teams Ugh, he‚Äôs Destiny fan too. hate weirdos like stuff clarify, Moderna Pfizer submitting rolling submissions BLA. 

So wasn‚Äôt like fill job application hit submit. like fed prospective employer pieces job application/resume bit bit analyzed pieces came in. vulnerable vaccinated - 90% 70 75+ first doses. Anyone lung issues got vaxxed months ago. Case numbers kind meaningless hospitalizations deaths stay down.

should tell need know   Ok. full authorization comes, almost employers requiring vaccinations. chucklefucks think going work? Im sure goal posts moved  People going another lockdown. Netherlands, Sweden Italy probably also end number similar UK. France surprisingly close too. I'm glad states still respect rights citizens. So, vaccines kids, right? stop elective surgeries beds?

It infuriating. like one house work polishing doorknobs. everyone benefits clean sterile doorknobs. intellectually lazy say, ""I never asked polish doorknob--I give fuck polish doorknob.""   sure good learnin' long expect us give lives society? it‚Äôs part society refused stay home, wear masks, won‚Äôt vaccinated. Want blame someone? Blame them. don‚Äôt care, don‚Äôt want save them. risk spread huge. It‚Äôs minuscule you‚Äôve vaccinated. want lock house forever go ahead many us done. thankfully mandated, I'll get see another post I'm guessing anti-vaxxer IG feed: ""Whatever happened bOdY ChOiCe."" Fuck dumb logic. Childish comment  south dealing nasty RSV wave right now. friend would encourage take break mental health. That‚Äôs ended needing survive. People think masks sufficient protection...and Address 'red-light/traffic laws logic' last statement please. Tell difference.

Your 'evidence shows' stance 100% selective reasoning. Stop worrying, risk anyone vaccinated. Good news. don‚Äôt want people carrying guns dumb.  60k Var, Bouches du Rh√¥ne &amp; Alpes-Maritimes. first, second fourth metropolitan departments highest new infections. 
We can't convince wearing mask. can't convince isolate themselves. can't convince taking vaccine.  


Should tell ""See hospital"" ? ""I know are, I?"" possible mask effective individual level someone COVID mandate everyone ineffective. fact, that's evidence shows. Keyboard warriors shifted battle lines fighting lockdowns sort requirement opposing even letting people know public health guidance healthy options are. This. God start worrying things rare getting car accident, getting struck lightning, etc? It‚Äôs ridiculous. WFT fan sad see leave wanted much money demonstrated point. good mediocre teams struggled teams winning record. Bye Felicia.  I'm sorry, trying tell understand error? 

You said: less 0.00427% breakthrough cases resulted hospitalizations. latest stats.

This absolutely, completely false. That's numbers work. divide total number hospitalizations total number vaccinated individuals get percent breakthrough cases result hospitalizations. divide total number *cases* number hospitalizations. way math completely missing number need order actually track breakthrough case rate. get vaccinated flu season too. would use listen science? 
 
I love dumbass arguments like ""People die traffic accidents use seatbelts?""   think insurance companies US also start adjusting policies reduce risk associated vacced? keep ranting shit one said anything about. I, post, never said thing anti-vax anything mask usage. Grow up, kid. It‚Äôs responsibility protect kids. you‚Äôre worried keep home wear masks. cannot expect every vaccinated adult things kids can‚Äôt vaccinated yet. maybe people support public health measures.

We give parents ""liberty"" kill kids. That's interesting I'm still way young get vaccine live young adult.  Brilliantly done. Loads MN fans already disliked Cousins. can‚Äôt imagine management tolerate season. walking embodiment cheap white bread soaked lukewarm water, that‚Äôs exactly plays football. accustomed disappointment Vikings, Cousins costly enduring mistake continues sting us new creative ways. thought crazy town yet again. People getting hysteric.

Its utterly unreasonable.

Bodily Autonomy Literally anything else.

because reddit, I've enough, point applies consistently.

2 things true time:

1. People vaccinated

2. People never forced governments anything bodies. that's true, Christian Scientists lobbied 1960s '70s religious exemptions medical treatment vaccines. least time, concerned avoiding breaking law getting protection disease. still priorisation there?
If yes, people lose priority refuse vaccine offered. vast majority recover sense smell within weeks, non issue.  They‚Äôre reaching full capacity 99.9% unvaccinated people. choice that. Start mandating people prove they‚Äôre vaccinated everywhere. you‚Äôre stay home. Stop punishing vaccinated people things aren‚Äôt fault. We‚Äôre done. I'm advertising. I'm asking sentiment stupid. vaccine didn‚Äôt cause someone stage four fucking cancer die. fucking stage four cancer did. family died cancer. go hill fast. stupid.  Prepare yourself: ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt trust approval rushed Fauci‚Äôs orders!‚Äù ***Whooooosh***

I wonder, even occur ask 'why?' assertion 'the mandates effective'. did, would see are, fact, talking two different things.

Pedantry tough habit break since pedants even aware own, limited mindset.

By limited logic, could say 'Traffic laws ineffective people still die running red lights.. therefore, need traffic laws red lights.' believe advertising allowed site...  can‚Äôt Covid? 

Because people generally know hurricane end case COVID surges handled US. Agreed. Never relieved childfree. know still risk dying flu. Might want hide away come flu season. it‚Äôs country runs gross domestic happiness, gross domestic product.  Also, Arizona, it‚Äôs already signed law. mask mandates vaccine mandates allowed schools‚Ä¶ oh yeah, it‚Äôs going terrible. ""I regret anything said context time said it, correct. told task force meetings serious problem lack PPEs"" - Fauci discussing whether regrets regarding masking guidance early pandemic. can't imagine scary must COVID pregnant. I'm glad little one okay, hope experiencing lingering effects.

I beginning third trimester pandemic struck. early days, officials saying, ""Pregnant women seem higher risk."" *never* believed nonsense. next data--basically couple studies Wuhan done early 2020. recall correctly, sample size one studies something like 10 women, contracted COVID late pregnancies (since virus new). safe, operated assumption would eventually find that, like *many* viruses, dangerous pregnant women. definitely scary time pregnant give birth. badass. say things like this, relies making large differing group people easy attack caricature. really *know*, evidence of, even say? No. really.

What's more, almost certainly plenty people vaccinated same, really great point comparison. database though, might pass getting bar something need electronic pass wouldn‚Äôt get one not:   15 .....Billliion! I‚Äôm sorry that‚Äôs problem. went school UF. would say expect, students follow it. least majority will, make others due peer pressure. university relatively sane compared surrounding. Yes. I'm inferring well. Thank florida max death average 184 (reached several times) case count max 16,000 daily. 

US max death average 3500 (reached twice) average 250k

remindme! two weeks

i hope right Got sources use meet anti vaxxer? Cleetus balls know downvoted,

Probably circle-jerk rhetorical question know answer point brings nothing new conversation.   Oh yeah forgot quote ugh! Weren‚Äôt cell lines taken fetuses died rubella like 50 years ago? It‚Äôs like they‚Äôre encouraging women abortions supply vaccine research. Lmfao. basically coming SAGE report trying predict future covid. Basically hypotheticals. report along prediction also make prediction Variants arising increased transmissibility decreased pathogenesis/virulence virus becomes fully adapted human host becoming endemic infection. Coupled likelihood eventual high populations immunity infection produces less disease. words, virus become like human CoV causes common colds, much less severe disease predominantly old clinically vulnerable.
Likelihood: Unlikely short term, realistic possibility long term.‚Äù

But course, don‚Äôt report this. headline wouldn‚Äôt good Absolutely. that‚Äôs right justification. can‚Äôt force anyone take medicine will, even dying. way frame address risks consequences choice. Denial work service justified risks imposed others. good bad? basis data resultant modeling outbreak probabilities CDC recommended return universal masking areas ongoing ""substantial"" ""high"" transmission.

Of course missed this. Sorry that!

Thanks excellent breakdown situation.  well would put category Hanta-virus CFR 30% range, luckily virus burn out. Keep mind far deadlier viruses like Ebola continue pop up, kills 60% infected travel far outbreaks last couple yrs. point laws going challenged ruled believe. judge Arkansas already halted law masks mandates. know old are, we've come LONG way smoking. used allowed almost everywhere, banned almost everywhere. Good point. Mostly due structural mechanisms it, difference ACE2 receptors kids adults. said, think people want take gamble kids life one avoid it, especially virulent Delta Variant is.

I looked deeper study seems issue done, mostly non replies treated full recovery (as someone commented thread). got positive data it, catch obviously.

See *As self appointed Supreme Punch Leader hereby decree shall ever punch squarely back! option submit overwhelming punch authority! Hear obey!* think one best things would government pushing vaccine hard take said vaccine. 

White house repeatedly said force white house staff recieve vaccine according fauci cdc nih far less 50 percent workers vaccinated. 

To lot people strange. vaccine best thing public America whole people literally giving vaccine touting safety efficacy getting vaccine themselves? 

To sit tell private business mandate vaccines stating repeatedly employees sends wrong message mean Covid 19 scary deadly even get vaccine. Well say. mean even get sick got 99% survival rate age 1 69 bad everyone trying paint as. say. man get vaccinated much secure influence last 1% risk. 

There reason restrictions based positive case load actual death hospitalization numbers would justify it. reasoning pretty much every country, used lockdown previously always based ""projections"" ""models"" never came true even close fear mongering numbers. 

BY way careful wish mandated vaccinations never end. already professor Sweden claims might need 5 shots get imaginary bullet prove immunity promised almost guarantee new variants future might even enough. many polio chicken pox vaccines shots get got single dose immune yet new, advanced, greater white bread technology might need 5 shots now. set red lights you. 

People warn mandated vaccination anti-vaxxer make billions influence use make money. give excuse mandate medicine end 2 shots anything vaccine passports keep expending. called booster shot next others follow. letting fox hen house yes hens example. still bad actor though... shockingly bad. someone explain didn‚Äôt children‚Äôs trials sooner?

Maybe initially covid barely affecting kids. United States think 300+ deaths age 18, comorbidity issues. Link actual SAGE report: want ask fill gaps knowledge willing whole process confusing. Pfizer announced November 2020 phase 3 trials concluded, 3 months started. thought phase 3 supposed last least year averages 3 years. missing seems completely line me

I'm confused explanation too. thought FDA approval clinical trials separate sounds like saying collecting data required FDA BLA means phase 3 clinical trials officially concluded manufacturer obligated continue them. that's case Pfizer need continue phase 3, move phase 4? Maybe I'm misunderstanding progression phases works. One side thinks Cold War, side still fighting it. Guess side winning today?  pressured approve it.

Or big pharma paid approve it.

Or FDA joke, approve anything.   RSV kills hundreds American children every year hospitalized tens thousands every year America. also discussing stop spread RSV schools daycares, causes morbidity mortality children COVID-19 thought heard somewhere we're 70% one dose? maybe that's world, US. comment automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Obviously never verified trials studies. believe seemed think vaccines affecting health negatively well, stopped vaccinating certain point, got big childhood ones though. 

Thank response, appreciate it. I‚Äôm gonna review couple times chew it. deniers assure affect children enough kids died yet give shit. I'm sure threshold reached, move goalposts again, wonder one anything sooner. don‚Äôt understand you‚Äôre downvoted. Abbott literally blamed immigrants every surge remember. [like [and gold medal!  Nah define ""extremely low""? deaths take 19.5 days (on average) back data far death rate similar past. 

so that's 100 (current average florida) deaths 7000 cases (florida three weeks ago), roughly 1.15% cases. hopefully deaths stop rising, i'd expect death counts rise three weeks case count peaks hospital staff vast majority Doctors, Nurses, Staff vaccinated. 

According Administration small minority vaccinated, medical reasons ""other"" reasons (last heard something like 6 people fall category)

Regardless reason hospital allow unvaccinated employees Medical Staff patient facing majority unvaccinated employees work home continue either get vaccinated virus goes away.

The Hospital Admimistration provided update potential mandate Hospital Attorney explained, State, would tricky enact one, overwhelming majority employees Medical/Dental staff vaccinated something need address juncture time happy current arrangement unvaccinated employees work home none patient facing.  100% agree Got J&amp;J vaccine trial participant. Also got covid end July. absolutely convinced minimized symptoms nothing two days mild fever runny nose (loss taste well). That's healthcare works. swear harm, pick choose whose life

This article two hospitals closing ER wards fully staff covid wards. picking choosing whose life save.

I'd say average guy car accident deserves treatment ER Anti-Vaxxer refused shot can't breathe. Good, wish need repeatedly burn stop touching fire, I'll take it.   RSV virus contagious dangerous young children. don‚Äôt talk serious measures limit spread RSV among children? trying contrarian - genuine question. think COVID-19 serious dangerous dad likely covid early days pandemic, felt like complete shit week. got J&amp;J vaccine back (and even tiny group side effects it, said we're infinitely better covid itself), recently got Pfizer booster shot.

He recently close contact infected person, spared suffering another week vaccines. Natural immunity wear soon enough constantly deteriorating, sooner get vaccines, safe, sooner protect suffering, worse. Governor Abbott prick one ?

Lt. Governor Patrick prick two ? Nope. Vaccine mandates around since least 1901 US. Look AMA formed. people *most* upset past years ones know better keep pretending like they're kooky rubes they're playing power influence. Ted Cruz knows better. Greg Abbott knows better. Ron DeSantis knows better. Michael Flynn knows better. wrestling fan, fuck Chris Jericho. Takes long time. Tons paperwork bureaucracy go through. take every single page scientific reports, analyze it, call scientists ask questions it, etc.  problem virus able mutate faster keep vaccine production distribution.  Source? Seriously. they're vaxxed cares. problem 99% driven unvaxxed adults vaccines... Especially guy, vaxxed yet simply he's irked pro-vaccine ‚ÄúI find little irksome big corporations, media government sort united front pushing vaccine hard,‚Äù Mr. Rose said. time, said, company instituted vaccine mandate, would likely comply. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hill I‚Äôm going die on,‚Äù said. ‚ÄúIf really became something going strongly affect career, would probably get it.‚Äù  No. incidence UK rare, certainly ubiquitous. Something like 15 percent. 

But we've seen UK, ptown tracing, treat corona like over, pack inside could get it, sure. That‚Äôs study done, though.

They followed known infections checked lasting symptoms. won‚Äôt skewed factors describing.

I‚Äôm arguing anything severity *or* prevalence disease itself.

I‚Äôm saying latest data suggests kids get Covid less likely long Covid. That‚Äôs it. get scammed. facilities go various state / federal / insurance loopholes able provide free testing. 

The reality often see popup clinics less well places. can't back that's Conservative ""alphas"" do. murder half electorate to, although see already beginning weigh DeSantis - visibly irritated salty.

But kidding. deaths causing every day probably registering broken moral compass, fact polls opponent - crisis. Also, immigrants, motherf\*\*\*s responsible everything. vaccine mandates declared constitutional early 1900s? Two FREE pricks needle. They're hoping early September.  Unemployment ran affected people, closing restaurants bars, real ""shutdown"", 100% table now. Mask mandates would ignored antivax crowd. Herd immunity. Would suitable headline you?

# ""**Only 0.2% Alabama COVID deaths vaccinated victims; 99.8% unvaccinated.**"" guess sarcasm detectors broken. Lol Good.  sold tickets aftershock. fucking way going dive covid cesspool right now.  33,000 people pack local CFL teams stadium last night. grand celebration return (somewhat) normalcy. Vaccines *not* required enter. local health region set vaccine clinic stadium.

Next province over, 33,000 *fully vaccinated* fans enter stadium.

I say, iffy crowds, also point think ‚Äúyou know, many us sacrificed much last year half, great thing people fully vaccinated aren‚Äôt really risking health.‚Äù unvaccinated? Personal choice. probably die attended game. said along wanted take chances virus. 

Nothing probably change minds outside personally effected virus. It‚Äôs want people get sick, but‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs they‚Äôve wanted.

Myself, I‚Äôm ready go event like that. I‚Äôm fully vaccinated, kids aren‚Äôt. 
I herpes. hate Karens saying wear condom, tell partners, bs. First all- death rate herpes almost zero. people who‚Äôs say I‚Äôm one gave you? probably already it! Condoms uncomfortable restrictive don‚Äôt even actually work. still get herpes even I‚Äôm wearing one. bother? Plus even know happens penis that‚Äôs deprived oxygen amount time? And, hello, people latex allergy can‚Äôt wear condoms!! really none matters- government cannot tell body!!! you‚Äôre worried getting herpes quit sex! glad live state protects personal freedoms!!  /s (I realize isn‚Äôt accurate analogy, I‚Äôm sarcastic reading arguments I‚Äôve read leap isn‚Äôt far-fetched.) Could expand people whose children free school lunch program? need work take care families extra cash could help take day needed get vaccinated get sore shoulder. I'm really eager know what's going happen. sure long start hearing positive cases event. Drawings weak old die. Poor grandma. mississippi nearly ICU rooms, many florida systems stopped elective surgery putting patients former cafeterias, TMC houston almost 100% way phase 2 surge plan (next step stopping elective surgeries). unfortunately houston Rt still 1.4 something ridiculous. check hospital system covid page details though since changes daily Hear hear, brother. Much like Tea Partiers primarying 2000s neocons (and 2000s neocons primarying Gingrich Republicans), think we're witness another shift Republican party former upstarts cannot control yet caused playing nuttier base. Speaking guy born army brat son man year 27 career, actual grunts military 18-24 year olds lean conservative mainly ‚Äúbackwoods, inbred hill billy fools‚Äù. Good luck convincing guys kill neighbors families. Great White playing. fine: Jack Russell co. always put strong emphasis safety shows. anyone know UoF vaccine mandate students, faculty &amp; staff? first step. pray. Nope need prey. Well worries, then. seems many people want bother taking one step forward anymore... Cite it, please.  I‚Äôm confused conflicting reports. mean normal expedited review approval would take six months. trying three months, because, know, pandemic. 

They didn‚Äôt want cut corners approve faster, would undermine confidence further. 

They fold public pressure recently ‚Äúsprinting‚Äù it, deprioritizing things focus approval.  So?  I'm anti masker. I'm going paranoid need be. plan see movie go bar date husband, done year half. I'll still wear mask public around anyone high risk would prefer it, mostly comfort others help keep behavior normalized, bother so.

But technically speaking, virtually zero chance giving anyone covid right now. Covid huge emotional burden family since pandemic began, burden lifted.   never liked original 70% goal. included one dose made seem like lot accomplished got everyone let guard down. absolutely mandated major corporations employees US end year, well public schools universities. doubt mind. Honestly, fuck every single tried say risk kids. Either kids care them. fucking sick people care anyone themselves. last year shown true colors many people. Ah! various employer incentives tracking device too... see many People vaccinated would feasible (staffing level wise) make mandation announcement. ü§î 90/80% lot, wow! can‚Äôt tell many people know personally swear it, never got tested. Thankfully they‚Äôve gotten vaxxed since. Except two acquaintances belong ‚Äúleopards ate face‚Äù party won‚Äôt get vaxxed because, well, don‚Äôt finish sentence, I? big deal? Gee‚Ä¶tell people affected it. Tell families lost loved ones inadvertently infected them. Tell people tubes throats. throw lot numbers around say nothing much worse could didn‚Äôt ‚Äúover-react‚Äù. I‚Äôve met people like you. type part problem spread false information masquerading facts. Go get vaccine, wear mask stay internet.  know local doctor head staffing large hospital. said believe 5% staff quit/won‚Äôt get vaccine 5% want get rid anyways since always cause stink everything else. mandate passing employees Hospital loads different positions. said mostly Drs nurses vaccine nurses don‚Äôt rest janitorial staff, food staff, positions. didn‚Äôt sound concerned 5% quitting shortage nurses. Start reading nonstructural accessory proteins. appears 1 week, 1 day. Still terrible What‚Äôs latest guy?  He‚Äôs also old fuck time football running back hit head tackled countless times. I‚Äôm sure body would trouble fighting anything. First, agree EMTs/Medics paid more. 

But, point EMTs make less really lot training actually can't make medical decisions. EMTs Paramedics interchangeable (at least CA assume states too). completely different roles. complete EMT training like 6 months, stepping stone become paramedic. would say EMT like working apprenticeship, (at least CA) EMT months even apply go paramedic school. EMTs ride paramedics medics make decisions. make 60-80k paramedic, best bad. 

The guy knew going paramedic school working EMT kinda explained like... high stress job, want people think make money. like new nurse hospital dealing patient coded...there senior nurses/doctors help them. ambulance patient, freeze/don't know patient might die that's you. low pay EMT think weed people good paramedics. Kinda like doctors start interning make like 50k/year first. But, think bad thing get paid more. ‚ÄúThe virus decide fate.‚Äù

‚ÄúI virus.‚Äù it‚Äôs religion made up? Who‚Äôs judge? Jesus christ. Thank you! Sorry. 

Moving on. bad cases US going anytime soon can't say sure, think so. time goes less outright among nursing staff, full approval help even more. mandates become widespread, refusing vaccine means tanking career find another place work least pandemic over.  always something keep kids safer.

You may able control school's mandate, may able get class covid-conscious teacher. teacher enforces masks, social distancing sanitizing/changing masks often. part school's PTA, may able create support least one covid-conscious teacher covid conscious parent move kids to. 

Do something interesting decent data point, but, also ""the researchers information severity infections"" covid get asymptomatic mild, probably fine outcome likely care get vaccine. That's exactly happened! India UK similar trends. Keep eye hard hit areas see later month next month. looks like Delta wave lasts month dropping according trends.  forget first lies mask - mask - sometimes mask - mask. 

I keep harping people follow CDC guidelines trust science damn people don‚Äôt make hard trust find forest trees. *speaks Monty Burns* ‚ÄúExcellent‚Äù  astounded anyone would choose fall pregnant moment. understand American safe abortion access fought, also know women actively trying children. Why!?! would right now? world bringing into?!? Irrespective testing regime, cases every part USA currently doubling every 3‚Äì14 days (except states 25%+ residents infected within past month, numbers longer increasing exponentially).

But yes, SF one places US testing. 1. Moderna testing original, updated version (beta), mixture, iirc multiple dosages. Pfizer testing additional dose vaccine.

2. Low. like mainstream media's reporting strategy regretful unvaccinated patients. guess anti-vaxxers COVID deniers mostly claim actors, might sway people. Honest question. taken FDA long approve this? honestly don‚Äôt get approving vaccines given great ammunition vaccine hesitancy. Got em WOW they're approaching lowest Rt *ever.* Hopefully happens places. Could delta moving susceptible population quickly burn easily? I‚Äôm single/solo parent we‚Äôve great, safe summer staying away humans really great time together. return teaching first grade weeks I‚Äôm simply terrified bringing home getting small little home daycare. 

I absolutely loved year remote teaching families class would agree didn‚Äôt survive, students thrived virtual classroom. hate isn‚Äôt option anymore. I‚Äôm thankful county issued mask mandate risks teaching 20+ unvaccinated kids day terrifying. Great state supreme court probably overturn thid decision course did. I‚Äôm literally homeschooling 8 12 year old (vaxxed) mask optional rule schools. fuck that. 18 month old 8 year old keep safe. People insane, swear. would surprised amount engineers scientists believe BS, especially older crowd allow weekly biweekly negative testing outright firing employees? üëè-üëè-üëè-üëè I‚Äôve seen vaccinated people get once, too. What‚Äôs point?  *Facebook: Oh ‚Ä¶ anyway* parents must feeding carb sugar diet past 11 years... think Fred's opinion majority people share. think vacationing beach? evidence FDA moving fast possible? can't science also want rush ""obvious"". Saitama: OK Jesus fucking Christ.. ""That's unpossible. Ain't thing history."" - cats_catz_kats_katz everyone else‚Ä¶. 

This sub highly politically charged scientifically based. recommend thorough research. 

Just someone slow get vaccine doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre anti vaxxing Trump truther.

Idk many times deal vaccinated people work, wearing masks, get spread virus. 

You lot think you‚Äôre invincible holier thou. research necessary. fact real requirement legally allow religious exemptions. Companies simply nice look bad public eye. law anti-women‚Äôs rights. Tell us it! Arizona dimwitted governor Douchy joining chat Honestly, conditions healthcare industry bad enough warrant waking long COVID came scene. Good them.  OJ strong. sliced necks, damn near cut Ron Goldman fellers head clean off. head almost cut way off. Like one floppy Canadian heads south park. bet lot youngsters know that. good here. I'm natural teacher though. article posted day showed vaccination reduced risk long covid infection half.  Grocery stores forced allow unvaccinated person shop store potentially infect customers. unvaccinated person longer welcome preferred grocery store, find different store groceries delivered. Good. unvaccinated friends coworkers keep saying won‚Äôt get it‚Äôs fda approved. Oh yeah. That's true. Fucking ridiculous get paid jobs. criminal. see. u/zslayer89 said, seems vaccine protected worst.

Glad feeling better now, cheers that! Pro- mandate, can‚Äôt wait. saw Disneyland Walmart mandate knew lots would follow  43 heat dome. 30s high 20s ever since. 37 week! really think it'll take long Jennifer pawn Chad's bike? Yeah it‚Äôs like 80 % needed delta unvaccinated Jew, Christian, Muslim pass away Covid meet God heaven. ""Why much earlier expected?"" God asks.

""We're bit surprised, too, know reason. trust greatness, sometimes work mysterious ways.""

God stares them, perplexed. ""What talking about? sent science, doctors, vaccines. even gave free basic education could understand taking vaccine help you.""

The three unvaccinated souls speechless. Christian finally says, ""But also gave us Fox news.""

God shakes head. ""That me, guy."" democrat presidency discrimination allowed. like can't fired HIV. able fired vaccinated not. Quote CDC ""The study observational, meaning can't show cause effect; researchers information severity infections. Alyson Cavanaugh, PhD, member CDC's Epidemic Intelligence Service led study, says possible people tested positive second time asymptomatic infections picked routine screening."" Agreed. China hiding thousands numbers start, East Asia‚Äôs case numbers would‚Äôve reflected that. And, well, didn‚Äôt. Well refuse working vulnerable population forced take it, anything, reduce potential liability hospital side.  anyone does: amp took surgery, hopefully link still works Random question: what's compliance like recent mask mandate?

Wishing best family trying time always makes laugh cause groups would probably trust things *less* got government agency approval. I‚Äôve heard antivaxxers‚Äô arguments refused get jabbed FDA approved. Wonder would move goalposts. wonder counterproductive. lot people antivaxxers think view things where, try force get vaccine, make things worse. Except Iowa. governor already signed law prohibiting public K-12 schools, accredited nonpublic K-12 schools (e.g. Catholic schools), public colleges universities (also state government agencies, counties, towns) issuing mask vaccine mandates.

Businesses, private colleges, private universities allowed issue types mandates, though.  Nope herd immunity longer thing delta. going live virus. anyone else listen Daily podcast episode today? wanted punch woman said she‚Äôs changed nothing life since pandemic - masking. sick COVID twice hospitalized. threw party house 8 15 guests got COVID, one died. said socially distances asked work, said home health care worker elderly, person cared (her grandmother) got sick covid died. wanted slap her. don‚Äôt understand going peoples minds. state facts still feel sort responsibility others? call personal decision decision literally kills others? I‚Äôm upset everything. we‚Äôll able sue complications arise later right? That‚Äôs fda approval means? local health unit print vaccine records database. Good. time ask me.

Wait what's definition religion? make something would valid 'Christianity' 'Hinduism,' 1 follower versus millions. they‚Äôve never refused vaccine religious beliefs call bluff fire ass. That's true.

I mean last year, remember exact details, believe Italian politician threatened violated lockdown flamethrowers. People straight celebrated that. People also routinely celebrate China's response COVID, mean world recognized authoritarian regime really celebrated even authoritarian. I'll say obviously lean heavily direction liberty, opposite authority. I'm also fine saying know appropriate response is, can't nothing either. I'm fine answers, I'm regular uniformed person like everyone else.

Also circumstances, mean circumstances surrounding COVID policy. COVID one issue yes, many policies proposed policies could described authoritarian. Things like vaccine mandates, mask mandates, vaccine passports, lockdowns enforced, on. also never made claim someone get vaccine. view personal medical decision healthcare provider. work good sized hospital system south east.

The Hospital managed lay anyone off. Gotta say proud coworkers management. eventually reinstated retirement plan contributions gave us ‚Äúback contributions‚Äù nice.

And no, one needs empathy people causing pandemic surge happen again. Mmm, maybe, even anecdotally we're seeing lot stories people getting vaxxed there. Sadly there's still LOT people provide spread. I'm worried what's going happen schools opening, especially since Delta seems hitting kids lot harder. think ID's free easily accessible everyone like voting.

If data shows correlation mask mandates transmission, I'd like see it. problem, online discourse vaccination difficult, say least. try assume person side screen engaging bad faith unless plainly obvious seemed someone asking question find government CANNOT go door door needles mandating everyone get jab

The real question is, private citizens get J&amp;J shots dart guns go adventures? admitted telling us covid airborne PPE shortage.

Where get that? think understand scientific process also stated wanted higher vaccination rate meet July 70% goal dropped mask mandate vaccinated people.

I think *very* simplified understanding ... someone's? strategy defeating virus. I'm saying using social engineering aka always giving us truth.

People going read thousands pages peer reviewed journal articles. information presented public consumption *necessarily* simplified, rather raw 100% truth. I'm also trying defend intentionally manipulative public messaging kind thing might done someone point. know never happen, would love see federal requirement public official US must publicly disclose vaccination status. 583 deaths two days ago 750 deaths yesterday. Still trending upward. see countries EU still supply limited high uptake, ones overtaken UK. told they've therefore true! Sure enough, deaths USA shooting upwards. UK deaths trending steadily upwards too, actually, despite cases plummeted peak. bode well Florida.  people get arrested punching horses anyone know children can‚Äôt get vaccinated? recently thinking won't. face zero repercussions elected president 2024. that's kind shit world live in.

Dude, thanks doing. I'm best stay hospitals here! work hospital requiring everyone (staff, clinical staff, medical students, residents, etc.) vaccinated September 27th fired. You‚Äôd surprised many anti-Vax people work hospitals :/ even simple. Church state united tell people it, they're trusted full population. don‚Äôt understand still haven‚Äôt grasped this.

That's exactly problem here. want live free democratic world, except people disagree you.

Your side mandating something unacceptable half population free democratic. fact, authoritarian. definition. said times already, I'm NY superintendent announced covid testing, telling parents positive cases school, daily check-ins. We're fully ""back normal"" except requiring masks inside. Masks required music classes lunch though. Also superintendent refers pandemic past tense. crazy red anti mask area NY either, quite liberal. Everyone acting like even here. Really blows mind people healthcare working knowledge vaccines, refuse get it. uneducated spewing shit vaccines understand makes blood boil. places mandating hope continues. None even half prepared us went 13 years school properly. weren‚Äôt prepared all! I‚Äôm understanding people keep talking shots ‚Äòcovered insurance‚Äô shots free correct? didn‚Äôt insurance able schedule J&amp;J shot get day cost little information even exchanged 15% - 30% covid infections lead long covid unpleasant symptoms many months. people got infected 9 months ago still breathing issues, tastes issues, brain fog, etc.

Source? Israel already vaccinating 12s taking way much personal offense here. I'm done. Sorry disagree here. health experts (at least active media) sold idea wore masks/vaccinate would go away. upfront even defeat strain, others inevitably occur.. reason society seems completely unaware variants new strains normal occurrence. Deaths take time people. Deaths.takes. time. i'm encouraging mom dad get moderna, seems like front runner now.

mom pfizer dose 1 2, dad moderna 1 2. It‚Äôs definitely gonna end like flu. We‚Äôll see repeats current delta scenario years come. virus outrun vaccines forever. probably getting pushed social media feeds well. like anti vax covid hoax crap we've seen. recent one I've seen wait it....the vaccine kills babies! even original, reasons always. Next, vaccine side effect making socialist develop Venezuelan accent (if thing exists). percentage population 5 years old 6%. risk. Covid risk 100% novel disease people commonly reinfected ages.

Like mentioned, daycare unavoidable families, especially anyone stay home get sick. measures propose?  Yes, more.

The Government can't go around forcibly injecting people, but... government *can* fine citizens getting vaccinated, depending said, far know, nobody proposing COVID-19. think exactly said; anti-vaxxers far likely behave way suffer reinfection. call correlation.

Or think behavior contribute odds reinfection? Oh good, could use refresher. So, showing real faces: psychopaths wants see people die COVID... Damn. anyone actually think would happen? generalization implied much higher thread, groups various sects religions vaccinating large numbers - religious restriction. ""But micro chips government tracking us. want cell phone drivers licence track me"" trying humorous, felt sorta relevant.. 

Am unaware quoting Quran frowned upon?  Thanks, that's better thinking would be, still seems like disaster. official say expected 40% schoolchildren infected eventually? seems unnecessary - managed make vaccine available couple months sooner. Bhutan badass. Let guess, Star Wars Fan? mandate stop transmission completely? Thought experiment:

Design effective system distributing airborne virus contagious chicken pox pulling vulnerable individuals half homes community, mixing randomly enclosed rooms five hours day, sending back home breathe families. resist getting vaccines, worry ... end time might come much quicker think. going lose recall. real challenge him.   Yes. I'm sure. point introduction flu vaccine, seen drop impact flu poplus. would surprised fact fewer people dying flu something rate vaccinated persons. Even rate less half poplus. said, fewer people dying thus makes people less concerned getting seriously ill flu thus means people less prone seek vaccination flu itself. Especially healthier people aware elderly immune compromised susceptible serious illness flu. knock effect. will. Again, roughly educated guess.

To clear. way shape form drawing similarity covid flu *not* same. Covid, actually SARS (cold) virus. symptoms may similar completely inconsequential. understand basic biology both. I'm comparing them. *only* pointing would surprised people getting vaccinated flu higher rate usual, likely similar reason we've see slack covid vaccines, people left overly *concerned* going get ill. 

But nothing ever point. point hypocrisy behind large portion people opposing vaccine people one end spectrum likely oppose vaccines. That's it. saying. Period.  talking them? see trump saw? Pretty sure called fans idiots times years.  not. Polio vaccine forced people. waited good instead?  Jehovah‚Äôs Witnesses take medical treatment *except* treatment involving use human blood. 

They encouraging everyone take vaccine, believe respecting sanctity life means make use available medical treatments.

I grew one, parents still it. Thanks intellectual insight weedman either situation. long vaccines mandatory, masks continue expected. paradoxical accuse lacking empathy stupid people going explain humans deterministic biological computers. see things incompatible actually, empathy stupid people also viewing victims hoping suffer exclusively result actions, whether deterministic not. Disagree. think vaccines anything ?  Totally agree. Wild attitude have. Fine. Get fired. Go work somewhere take you.   seen that, no. I've read Lambda far, appear ""vaccine resistant"" still studied (like them). Delta definitely much bigger concern point. State authoritarianism? Come now. joke. Lmfao. authoritarian seatbelts. pediatric - tell saying simply true. RSV spreading widely daycares across city. daycares getting shut RSV cases. Physicians generally even mandate RSV kids stay daycare full period contagiousness. physicians daycares use archaic non-evidence based standard ‚Äúno fever 24 hours‚Äù, kids contagious significantly longer that. comment lawyer sound accurate (at least consistent article mentions, neither defendant lawyer objected hearing).

Parole privilege mean convict judge's puppet though. Would acceptable judge require parolee take sugar pills twice daily? Sure harmless, right judge require that? Maybe judge could require parolee commute via public transportation, cut carbon emissions form community service. maybe cut meat dairy parolee's diet many extra resources go calorie meat vs calorie plant matter. Maybe parolee gay, want community service hardline christian charity. Maybe parolee strongly pro-life feel comfortable community service Planned Parenthood. see good reason judge need prescribe form community service objectionable defendant. million ways serve community can't find one state defendant agree on?

Let's keep mind two things. First, defendant human. freedoms lost upon conviction crime, certainly them. legal system must still treat appropriate dignity. Second, crime possession fentanyl. see references intent distribute, see judge implying defendant uses opioids. victim crime, they're addicted crime result disease. person need put cell, need forced injection. likely need social services help deal potential opioid addiction get set support group. 

Also misspoke said parole - actually probation case. think matters - either case think ""don't crime can't time"" stance misplaced.  thought 95% effectiveness pre-Delta. Head r/prisonhooch learn _fast_ starting seem like cop me

Well, fortunately, vaccination numbers among black community. [They already better numbers Republicans back they've getting vaxxed higher rates since then.

I'm honestly point I'm starting think CDC data seriously undercounting (40% vaccinations race data) much concern rates (relative general US population). realize speed due coordinated investment capital research across massive international scale, right?

Consider average medication. maybe one two companies globally R&amp;D one multiple projects going one point time. thousands scientists, dozens companies, tons research capital, sharing lot pertinent information regular basis (i.e. genome mapping, working, etc). much ""many hands make light work"" situation.

You also remember coronavirus researched before. first SARS (2002), MERS (2012), etc. Ever since those, least scientists working somewhere world like started ground zero - running start.

And finally, finding test subjects. WAY subjects sign could use. is, phase 3 trials Pfizer Moderna nearly 10x normal number participants phase 3 trial. resulted massive amount trial data helped refine safety analysis risk models could much robust.

While take lot time, simply raw amount effort humanity collective whole put forth try solve problem. Deadspin good write Kirk Cousins yesterday.  Jehovahs witnesses encouraging everyone take respect sanctity life. grew one (and left adult, parents still it.) accept pretty much medical treatments except blood  Yes is. course. WELL aware this- calling religious restriction v cultural issue misinformed best.  fire department short guys, would argue still hire arsonists.

Please accept virtual gold award (the one bestow atm) 100000 hardly deaths imagine? Idk health experts transparent it. 

Most transparent it. People chose ignore people like concerning news. know also destructive? Life long illness death.

K-6 eligible vaccine yet. Sticking kids crowded schools answer. impact learning less ideal, sure, shit happens kids adapt. Sometimes stop dwelling things can't control work reality is. Right now, reality we're faced one virulent respiratory diseases ever can't ignore find convenient. Oh no, can't inhale toxic, lung-destroying fumes couple weeks, I'll still call vaccine bad. Good. understand trepidation man, it‚Äôs time get vaccinated. wonder subligual tab might popular people vaxxed get incredibly sick, vast majority tiny percentage huge medical issues begin with.

 So, realistically, absolutely staying away large gatherings restaurants bars right now. Even though they're vaxxed. good, contrast UK 94% people age 50+ fully vaccinated almost 90% aged 40+ fully vaccinated. We‚Äôve got ways go confident breaking curve hospitalizations deaths.

Page 4  armed Fox News-addled psychos there, vaccine mandate would downright dangerous. covid fucked olympics last 2 weeks many athletes trying compete. olympics postposted 1 year infection numbers comfortable number surging is. shows people power would rather fun serious global pandemic. even used olympic money treat covid instead tv show. Hi, I'm trying find experiences information people got vaccine allergic flu shot. GP said OK I'm still pretty hesitant. reaction flu shot, immediate anaphylaxis... We're sure happened BP went 150/130 felt like crap 24 hours after. history migraine, psoriasis, endometriosis, PVCs hypokalemia. I'm US 3 probably avoid J&amp;J shot due clot risk. advice would appreciated. Maybe time happens, places require vaccination too.  They're currently 500 deaths day.

Lots high risk people vaccinated hopefully lower death rates time around. point ""pursuit happiness"" mentioned Constitution Declaration Independence, legal document? many schools threw hands got rid safety protocols masks time Delta.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  ^ lies disinformation. Comments like getting people killed. Using CDC numbers. vaccines protects getting serious Covid rate 99.999%. advertised over, google it. also state 25 times chances catching vaccinated. Fair. 

So:

100 - 99.999= 0.001 

Thus: 

.001 * 25 = 0.025

So, using logic, chances immune system fight catch serious covid win are:

99.975% 

For references condoms 97%, birth control pill 99% effective. 

But wait, more! 0 health issues younger (Under 50) okay health. 0.9% chances dying Covid, happen catch serious Covid. know serious risk side effects vaccines. Seriously, look up. 0. mean Canada even dropped AZ due possible health risks. 
What mean? 

That perhaps Sweden now, focus high risk groups. People 60 known 7 health issues KNOW put people elevated risk. Since clearly represented per medical study 4.9 million covid patients based 800 hospitals linked above. 

There reason use jack hammer solution fine scalpel solution would do. 

The ones lose objective careful pharmaceutical companies making millions extra vaccine sales. 

Albeit may like that, since NIH owns part Moderna vaccine. check data yourself. believe me. Go yourself. Believe eyes critical thinking. want miserable others miserable? Seems like sad existence.   haven‚Äôt approved yet?  got vaccine back May. 

The reason ask recently unvaccinated coworkers tested positive work work pretty close-quarters kitchen 8-12 hours day. Meanwhile, 3 us vaccinated tested negative. 

So running skeleton crew keep restaurant open top already short staffed. Feels like I'm punished getting vaccinated lmao listening *The Daily* podcast yesterday interviewing different ant-vaxxers one said hesitant take approved even though COVID last year cough bad smoke couple weeks. realize fucking stupid really are. data specific variants? Afaik observational study conducted February-April done Gamma dominant variant Lambda 2nd place, separate categories each. girlfriend scientist I‚Äôm around science friends, it‚Äôs pretty obvious lacking communications skills department. 2 recent studies suggest may true: K. Floridian youtubers getting covid finally tell followers get vaccinated. never seen masking videos now. Moderna passively mentioned week Delta specific booster trial (similar beta specific booster testing since Feb). [See notes - called mRNA   Actually covered National vaccination injury compensation program it‚Äôs fully approved everyone. governor Yeah would really hard mom voice considering I'm male. LOL fucking hunting them. refuse get vaccine. decision makes danger others. result consequences it. rhetoric true 16 months ago, wouldnt mess. gets heart matter. Sadism driving motivation politics.

Those people put health risk, turn put risk. That's boils to, well-earned lack sympathy towards one's fellow man.

And necessarily disagree. think past year done lot discredit many enlightenment-era notions underpinning western society like rationality people ability educate them.  one recent videos (2021 update #6, believe), mentioned around 98% JWs facility New York vaccinated. So, yeah, get shots. Already shows, many sold out. I'm fine, weeks. large downtown event last couple thousand people too, one panicking like Reddit.

Leave house awhile stop living fear. vaccine safe effective.  one think correct way interpret 71%:

1. J&amp;J person 71% less likely get hospitalized unvaccinated person; or

2. *If tested positive*, J&amp;J person less likely get hospitalized unvaccinated person tested positive; or

3. *If tested positive showing symptoms*, J&amp;J person less likely get hospitalized unvaccinated person tested positive showing symptoms.

Thanks! feel it‚Äôs person‚Äôs right drive drunk public road? similarly endangers others mad bro? argument wasn‚Äôt good insult me? Lmfao ü•¥  case, two pricks *caused* problem. Feel free enlighten us wisdom, could use good chuckle today.  could see cutting deal part community service, /u/Barbicore mentioned. judge's statement though particular case bit less pleasant; says defendant accepted risks using fentanyl, objection vaccine, implying forfeited right object putting far worse stuff body. there's pushback defendant's lawyer, IMO right thing resentence. that's private prisons for! data seems show pretty clearly that:
1) delta escape potential naturally acquired immunity previous variants, vaccines 

2) natural immunity provides protection almost good 2 shots Pfizer moderna

3) 2 shots Pfizer moderna still bit better. 

4) previous infection + single shot Pfizer moderna significantly better immune response 2 shots Pfizer moderna. 

5) single shot Pfizer moderna offers limited protection delta. 

I don‚Äôt read much j&amp;j astrazenica, far fewer studies looking them. sometimes can't save ppl stupidity. wish covidiots take entire hospital system them. unfair ppl need life-saving treatments sidelined doctors &amp; nurses care America's selfish. anyone immuno-compromised man. dont know numbers. Anyone transplant, etc OK, hope right are, that's freaking awesome. clear, there's 3 ways read statistic: 

1. J&amp;J person 71% less likely get hospitalized unvaccinated person; or

2. *If tested positive*, J&amp;J person less likely get hospitalized unvaccinated person tested positive.

3. *If tested positive showing symptoms*, J&amp;J person less likely get hospitalized unvaccinated person tested positive showing symptoms.

Now Mom education experience in? designing testing vaccines? Probably not, means experience necessarily relevant that. like, say, Physicist educated person, necessarily mean knows fix problem car develops knock engine.

What I'm getting often get terrible assuming experience one area translates experienced another. Mother ran veterinary clinic, know tuckpointing fix brick building? know rewire electrical panels office? know lay flooring? program software used? guess even knew those, know them, that's nobody ever knows EVERYTHING, really experts.

As dog owner, rely vet tell dog sick, recommend treatments, generally give educated evaluation dog's health. that's stops. go vet information human vaccines, that's outside purview. may persuasive, they're expert. 

So say modern world, need rely experts, ones know what's actually going studied thing. even mean ""Only listen people PhDs"" though. work I'm considered somewhat Excel expert I've worked 15 years. boss comes ask questions data I'm one that's elbow deep it, give expert answer. knows ask things I'm knowledgeable about, people team experts areas goes things. mean *everyone* expert, expertise come many shapes sizes. I'm sure there's someone editing Wikipedia article that's one foremost Transformers experts world, example.

That's listen though. determine, beyond credentials, listen to? Well, let's look Mom again. Mom developed hypothesis working thousands animals vaccines causing health issues. experienced health issues, applied hypothesis say ""Oh, vaccine made cancer worse."" Let's examine that.

I've known thousands humans ingested chocolate. mean safe dogs? Dogs also vulnerable heartworm need medication keep developing it. take heartworm medication? Humans animals different, similarities, translate 1:1. things really dogs harmless us, vice versa. 

So even *if* Mother right hypothesis vaccines making animals sick, testing verify effect humans? run randomized control trial? gather data thousands patients? look patients cancer see recently vaccinated? look people recently vaccinated see developed cancer? take personal tragedy try find reason behind it, like almost everyone experiences tragedy does?

I'm trying diss Mom here. People often try find reason behind tragedy. want know something happened, how. turn divine explanations (God testing me), turn morality (It's I'm bad person), turn behavior (It's take care myself), turn external factors (It's something gave me). Mother grasped something could explain tragedy happened her, mean right.

Also, random note. said ""theory"", ""hypothesis"". important distinction, hypothesis idea claim, whereas theory rigorously tested. Mother take sibling pets litter, raised house, feed food, give vaccines one see effects? closely track thousands animals vaccinated unvaccinated control group, control things study like age, breed, environmental factors, manufacturer vaccine (different manufacturers might different ingredients), dosage, etc? not, theory, idea. mine think humans co-evolved dogs would different never domesticated them. evidence this, tested looking ancient societies dogs comparing ones didn't. idea, make truth.

Lastly though, millions pets vaccinated every year. Millions people vaccinated every year. get vaccinated different diseases, using different technologies (meaning technology went manufacturing them), using vaccines developed periods 50 years ago past year. Vaccines one studied things planet affect many people planet. chance death series side effect something like, 20%, would see evidence around us. Even 5%, would scientists freaking far higher diseases like flu even Covid-19, again, would notice. 600,000 people died last year disease 2% fatality rate US. 165 million people vaccinated US now. 5% death rate, seems like small number, would 8.25 million. look population scales, see dangers people claim there, one person unfortunate cancer diagnosis thought due vaccine evidence beyond feeling. bother vaccine swap, fit much robust 5g chip tip instead push tiny needle hole. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt need‚Äù isn‚Äôt ‚Äúwon‚Äôt help‚Äù. AFAIK studies shown 1 shot Moderna highly effective hospitalization death, don‚Äôt consider fully vaccinated second shot; single dose J&amp;J effective doesn‚Äôt mean shouldn‚Äôt consider whether booster shots help boost immunity protect J&amp;J recipients better. Considering studies showing AZ-Pfizer mix effective, producing stronger antibody response AZ stronger t-cell response Pfizer, would much like see booster shot J&amp;J could help.

Wasn‚Äôt study conducted 2-dose J&amp;J vaccine? wrong (Gov cannot force anyone specific medical things body).

But that's also point either. Nobody trying ""force things body"". 

The problem people want stay unvaccinated ALSO continue actively participate broader society (in case they're putting people risk). 

You (and stay) unvaccinated want. can't go social things put people risk. point need rename country ‚ÄúThe States‚Äù people feel bad parents. spent ton money raising results got questionable. Nah it‚Äôs fact, people died complications J&amp;J vaccine administered. honesty blows mind even made aware cases. clearly wasn‚Äôt shared you. company can't ask provide proof? There's mod find reason delete thread.

Kids getting Covid something allow post here. It‚Äôs clear round mask mandates going nearly strong widespread last year. places US still mask mandates, vast majority private businesses requiring employees wear them, new mandates applying city owned buildings. would estimate 20 percent US population true mandate right now. Last year Texas Alabama state mask mandates. 

Why pointing out? think CDC backed corner now. changed guidance prematurely back May changed couple months later, advice heading toward treated like advice steak sushi. really need hire media expert something. vote goes ""I'll screenshot part article that, taken context, serve enrage polarize like-minded people, post Facebook Twitter"" crowd. What's original context, even mean seems imply, even real, doctored invented whole cloth? We'll never know, I'm getting fucking outraged screenshot saw! Fozzy?

You'd think risk death better music. Archives:
* Yeah, since still spread even got vaccinated. read news, you? Check cards? else would confirm it? Check cards make list people vaccinated. Demand either vaccine card(at point they're removed list) negative test result every day. Lol sure downvoted... comment obviously meant sarcastic. cares. They'll get can't work take kids school.  Nah, fine. right. everybody mom voice. thank kids that. I‚Äôm OK option reduce sentence somewhat, agree - Forcing someone OK. told parents wanted schools reopen, homeschooling sucked, people promoted homeschooling decades. Autodestruction pretty normal, tha animal, understand it. mean people say Jan-Feb/March 2020 it‚Äôs pretty unlikely anyone covid too.

I think coworkers around (and myself) got Late Feb/Early March. showing symptoms week March 9 13. Friday 13th last day office started self isolating. symptoms kept circling downward called Ambulance March 28. ended spending total 38 days Hospital 16 ICU Ventilator. (longer detailed description experience here: 

I vaccinated (Pfizer shots Jan/Feb 2021).. interested recommendations come Boosters (and variants) new? One thing I've witnessed elected office little many people seem care kids. Covid one example. years I've fighting lack school funding. Heck, city gave local school money hire crossing guard just... didn't. took four years even get smoking disallowed ""tot lot"" park preschool-aged kids. bad people get know them.  


I'm sure bad person either, would get know you.  


Stop reading news articles. hate-mongering. You, rascal you! sir, topicals, please read bible Paul 13:10:

""Thou shalt apply TOPICALS thy skin. TOPICALS icky feel gross BLASPHEMY UNTO LORD."" one thing could suggest might work cases remind people vaccine 100% free matter get insurance. flu shot always free cost $40, lot people make excuses get flu shot free can't (or want to) afford it. 
I found one person seemed think COVID vaccine, I'm sure he's one. Yes, know 100% free, lot people well informed misunderstood 100% free *with insurance* maybe insurance.

So know someone reluctant get vaccine, argue them, try drop conversation something like, ""Well, I'm glad free everyone -- walk Walgreens CVS get shot free, even insurance. That's one thing I'm happy taxpayer dollars go to!"" might convince someone reluctant admit money concern regarding vaccine said someone unvaccinated got vaccine day. set reminder phone text three week mark go get booster. Can't wait FDA approval start seeing choice whether damage public health taken away moron anti-vaxxers.

I'm natural selection, reality shit can't get back even modicum normalcy either select leper colony, society takes strong stance places public health individual's right literal toxic moron. It‚Äôs definitely true time. months antibodies circulate. long term.  start quoting Quran humorously, going bad time. recent COVID-19 deaths among vaccinated‚Äù

What would point headline? article headline pointing happening majority cases seen recently. headline narrative would focus minority recent cases. idiotic. old religion forbids vaccinations founded vaccinations invented. already much nonsense written bible, koran, etc. really need add this.   Remember last year Dear Leader told puppets ""[If didn‚Äôt testing, would  anyone idea what's actually happening Florida? 'ELI5' maybe dumb lol. Despite 'Florida Man' stereotype they're reporting 49.4% population fully vaccinated moment 19,000+ new cases daily rising. Random states comparison (Note: I'm using 'fully vaccinated' numbers say 'vaccinated', numbers 7-day averages). 


Florida: 49.4% vaccinated -- 19,000+ new daily cases -- 88 new daily deaths

Illinois: 49.0% vaccinated -- 2,000+ new daily cases -- 11 new daily deaths

Texas: 44.3% vaccinated -- 13,000+ new daily cases -- 52 new daily deaths

California: 53.4% vaccinated -- 11,000+ new daily cases -- 44 new daily deaths

New York: 57.6% vaccinated -- 3,000+ new daily cases -- 9 new daily deaths

West Virginia: 39.1% vaccinated -- 300 new daily cases -- 3 new daily deaths 
(I threw West Virginia comparison realistically, probably rural is. Hard spread populated area.)

Is heat? People hanging together inside often southern/hotter states? really seems like less politics dense population typically whichever state looking + climate live in/how comfortable outside right now.

I get politically-injected pandemic become plenty Republican-lead states bad are. Sure, they're statistically worse blue states, specifically Florida poorly right now? mean, I'm guy, keep mind, would think combination 2 3. scannable QR code? 4000** people without co-norbidities died Covid 19 England.

Read again, slowly. I'm major city technically new guidelines state Governor ""fully aligning CDC guidance"" nothing changed since July. Major retailers still requiring ""unvaccinated"" customers wear mask; nobody asked put mine, several unmasked patrons shops.

Of course, entirely possible CDC caved pressure corners ""do something"" knows damned well much advice followed. government give Healthcare government gun religious fans keep voting in. ‚ÄúScience‚Äù read post 4chan deriding way modern women live whatever reasons.

We're going get hit Delta wave, matter time. Id take personal precautions govt officials react late. Hospitalizations deaths matter.

I'd say country also high risk due low overall medical resources. article noted 300 doctors entire country, train couple thousand health care workers distribute vaccines, deliver vaccines villages (after door-to-door notifications get everybody coordinated) via helicopter.

Uh, there's someone reply mine.

You know lab = test, beyond that, familiar education perform testing? Without googling it. reason J&amp;J keeps getting stronger mRNA drops Looking size kids, don‚Äôt think great parental figures. teen gets size without parent enabling them. Less susceptible equal immune. risk still orders magnitude less adults clearly increasing. 

The CDC/FDA needs get butt authorize vaccines children. believe means 71% less likely hospitalized unvaccinated person. could asked me. urgent care seen plenty people get COVID 3 times one year. Easily. Thanks! Oh heh... happens too. Nothing newsworthy, surprised.

... actually healthcare I'm sure be. and? 

what say? May ask decide getting Pfizer vs Moderna second shot bee allergy, got Pfizer, adverse effects. anybody producing graphs depicting covid case rises per state comparison vaccination rates? leaked CDC documents Provincetown, link it? leaked WaPo news outlet? Yeah, food deserts brutal. able easily access healthy food disaster. People don‚Äôt live food deserts, especially transportation don‚Äôt understand hard be. stores nearby sell mostly junk food, like said, whatever healthy food might offer high cost it‚Äôs worth it. think ripple. Delta fast, 

when cases spiked 

36 mil 2 doses - 10 mil one , 5 mil confirmed cases, probably 10-15 irl - leaves us 5-10 mil. Basically Corona already infected ones caring fast. can't keep speed. 1/10 persons potential target, see reduces speed. harder get rest, still come rest without doubt.

Basically f'x fx math task now. 

The question be: many preventable deaths unvaccinated happen much negatively affect society. without doubt worse point open fast throw away restrictions instead slower steadily reducing restrictions, maybe could far worse high efficacy vaccines There's future closing everything US ever been. waves run course cases rise everywhere. difference vaccine prevents severe illness. Areas lower vaxx rates healthcare systems tested areas higher rates. waves continue foreseeable future. think they're keeping track centralized way tbh Yes ""But can't catch outdoors!"" - people months forgetting barbeque superspreader events last year  I'm lying, especially since leftover vaccines going go bad anyways.

I'm entirely sure whether it'd actually make vaccinations remote locations, away factory, arrive faster it.

Excellent analysis. afford costs liabilities? healthcare costs already going skyrocket due Covid. health insurers posted bad Q2 numbers due losses past 12 months. No, functioning brain. Huh?

Maybe compared Japan, South Korea, Australia, it‚Äôs pretty evident took COVID seriously pretty much every Democratic state US (arguably). use mask toilet paper Wait next variation, virus even lethal already delta. Or, god forbid, vaccine resistant. Im curious theres always one person thread mentioning lambda, im complete doom sayer best day, think lambda concerning reading sounds like lambda might well dud efficacy delta. vaccinated previously infected Delta burned little populace remained without immunity/weak immunity fucked burned little tinder remained. 

I'm perplexed people surprised, honestly. 

Something similar (though larger though catastrophic death toll due lesser vaccination rates though mitigated ironically sheer amount probable prior infected due anti-masking phenomenon.) occur American south. bright supernova hospitalizations rising curiously earth shattering deathtolls followed sudden thud Delta burns remaining fuel quickly. ‚ÄúYou entitled opinion. entitled informed opinion. one entitled ignorant.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs important safety,‚Äù stressed Tom Michel, president Nevada Vegas Rooms. 
 
At Nevada Room, customers grab bite eat enjoy musical show. restaurant-performance space hybrid exactly kind place would require proof vaccination Big Apple. 
 
Michel tells us Las Vegas went path, he‚Äôd ready. 
 
‚ÄúI think would adjust it,‚Äù said. ‚ÄúYou know, adjusted masks; adjusted 50 different protocols put place.‚Äù

He‚Äôs already hearing people say they‚Äôre worried go indoor venues due Delta variant. So, avoid worse situation keep business thriving, Michel vaccine requirement. 
 
‚ÄúI would much rather kind mandate shutdown again,‚Äù shared. 
 
Liam Dwyer, owner 7th &amp; Carson Downtown Kitchen &amp; Bar, worries vaccine mandate hurt business. Still, says safety first. 
 
‚ÄúI agree whatever keep customers community safe,‚Äù told us. ‚ÄúI mean, sound extreme today? Yes. six months now, may seem necessary.‚Äù

Bezos forced wear mask inside spaceship? approximately 50 million kids united states. sure .001% came from, made up. assuming real world meaning kids end hospital get Covid-- every single child United States currently infected Covid would mean 500 kids who'd end hospital system. enough overwhelm systems.

 


So could one following:

A) .001% accurate.

B) Hospitals overrun children.

C) Children hospitalized far greater numbers things Covid also happening currently.

 


That's would take math above. honestly know. poland, hungary czech republic similarly low cases. 

we took first waves pretty seriously. masks still mandatory indoors, almost everybody uses public transportation. school mostly online. ton people work remotely. curfews past 9-10 pm cities. government closed indoor sports. one point fill form traveling cities case stopped police.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  mean, Pope Francis encouraging followers get vaccinated. sure cite religious exemption Catholic head honcho directing get it. saw people yesterday maybe 85% wearing regardless Honest question: covid vaccine protect better recovery natural infection?

If so, why? lived FL NYC summer different. NYC arguably worse actually outside walking around stepping garbage water. Correct I'm wrong, think unlikely virus mutate evade immunity much already has.
  
The reason being: covid mutate vaccine-evading variant, would compete as, more, contagious delta currently is. Case point slightly immune escaping variants right ""losing"" delta. know we've often heard ""vaccines mutate become contagious less deadly"" technically true, however, contagious strains ""win out"" deadly strains simply infect potential hosts first, deadly go. whats cliffnotes  give insight why? People careful spend time somebody vulnerable. 

My grandma 94 I‚Äôve twice past four months. nothing sniffle, headache, slight cough. Low chance COVID takes like 10 mins free. don‚Äôt think good reason believe either. 

In US, number deaths verified caused Covid 600k. total number deaths associated Covid 1M rising, based excess deaths cause morbidity statistic. extra 400k deaths caused attributed Covid, well things like delayed medical care. 

India unfortunately publish numbers nationally, truth never know whole impact. current estimate based published excess deaths 1.2M estimates going 4.5M. Tired sob stories. change headline ‚Äúidiots refuse vaccine pay price.‚Äù  Maybe it‚Äôs didn‚Äôt like tone announcement all. seemed much like celebration. It‚Äôs good news shared. also really didn‚Äôt like Murphy said anybody telling open schools without universal masking lying you. Since June said would leave districts. big fan Murphy throughout pandemic disappointed today.  crazy new medication know nothing about. incredibly simple vaccine really different happens catch cold. difference even bad function trigger immune response.

One thing know sure virus MUCH likely cause issues simple vaccine. Poor guy, really requires high flow underneath 100% NRB mask, it‚Äôs looking extremely bleak I‚Äôm sure fellow healthcare providers watching instantly came conclusion. Tragically, I‚Äôd wager stories like would simply show crazies Facebook algorithm, maybe convince apathetic folks. It‚Äôs seasonal every season covid season - least enough people get vaccinated die off. Hello Tsar Putin. chickens come home roost. thoroughly enjoyed 102-degree fever got second Moderna shot. rather excruciating TMJ pain days fever made feel like getting warm facial massage. fever broke, TMJ faded away rather fast. talking uncle born 1953 remembers school kids dropped local vaccination clinic waiting line get small pox vaccine. 8. said girls given option get shot hip, boys needed get arm. Edit: clarify vaccine. happens make bad political decisions health crisis override sound medical advice.

 Unconscionable.  agree. vaccinated person myself, however hard distinguish vaccinated unvaccinated.  Nobody forcing get vaxxed want to. company's policy, want follow get new job. Contrary popular belief, entitled job anywhere actually deserve job want it. different places allowing piercings, visible tattoos, unnatural hair, uniforms. like it? work there...pretty simple. United holding people vaxing without consent. personal moral difference telling someone ""I can't give anyone"", telling someone ""I going give help you"" telling someone ""I this, die without something stupid"".  

Also, honestly, I'd rather start whole withholding-care--is-legit-because-people-contributed-to-their-condition thing. US insurance industry would love able withhold care people ""should known better"" - every insurance company country would whole new department dedicated figuring whether people back injuries known better sit like time, people cancer known better eat red meat, etc etc. Presumably children exposed before, therefore harder hit things started opening up.   specifically referencing first months certain people could vaccinated florida could states. states opened vaccinations people, less would felt need go florida get one faster.

that said, way many florida's decisions based tourist dollars rather tourists lives Consequences. Hard feel sympathy willfully ignorant got caught pants down. Kind like village Italy 100 year olds due one guys ancestry. Came say exactly this. thought clever company name remote atleast remainder 2021 5:34 I‚Äôm sorry, sucks. hope things get better state. best set good example hope others follow suit. never herd immunity. impossible get whole world vaccinated time avoid variants. got downvoted saying there‚Äôs huge piece WSJ *today* arguing previously infected people exempt employer mandates also arguing vaxed might dangerous previously infected people. ‚Äúnatural immunity‚Äù push coming angles. We‚Äôre going lose people aren‚Äôt antivax *they‚Äôre told get vaccinated.*   Waiting see state bans testing first test one dies covid. article clear. permanently cutting friends, cut ""weekly routine"", likely reunite COVID becomes afterthought? R rate = measure infectiousness disease.

R 1 means average infected person infect one person. R 2 means average infected person infect 2 people etc.

The 0.8 means infected person would average infect 0.8 people (or prefer, every 10 infected people would infect 8 new people, 8 people would infect 6.4 people on), means number infections drop time. I've seen couple articles cite specific interviews doctors work one hospital, able find broad look hospitals country world. really hard look trends keyhole like that. find anything widespread stats, I'd love take look! mutate per se ""not-that-big-a-deal"" *will* become everyone acquiring form natural immunity immunity vaccination. Full stop. future COVID places world. mean, I‚Äôm definitely worried hospital capacity, gonna lie. We‚Äôre watching university president post hostage videos YouTube tho lol: 5:33 PM neat think [Masks Back, Maybe Long think points Atlantic piece accurate? sounds kind enticing discussion CDC swinging's behavioral ramifications, gets grim pessimistic outlook tactics‚Äîmasks included‚Äîhave proved effective many people might never drop them. off-ramp many people imagined may simply exist. Although pandemic-caliber masking won‚Äôt universally embraced long-term, Maldonado, Stanford vaccine expert, thinks we‚Äôre headed toward ‚Äúsoft stop‚Äù masking societal rethink face coverings. ‚ÄúI think people going feeling uncomfortable without masks time,‚Äù told me. Masks might slip socially seasonally, people move public spaces, temperature drops winter. Public-health officials could also recommend face coverings intermittently lockstep outbreaks, method tide people boosters. ‚ÄúIf people smart, continue mask they‚Äôre high-risk situations,‚Äù least while, Maldonado told me, perhaps SARS-CoV-2 airway viruses well. practices long commonplace elsewhere, United States many Western countries haven‚Äôt hopped board before, maybe now. Australians ‚Äúreally come full circle masks,‚Äù Subbarao, Melbourne vaccine expert, told me. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see lot pushback it.‚Äù

So... think? worst jurisdiction North America while. reluctantly implemented restrictions that.  enforce facemasks inside concerts too. May ask vaccine had? interpret plenty something would wager English terribly artistic language damn fucking awful sharing text only. Id take plenty 4-12 see couple id categorize plenty fair amount rare. heck knows OP hospital, cause yea, id rate 8 crazy high. Healthcare workers don‚Äôt wear masks full shift (break room, cafeteria, nurses station, supply/transfer areas).

Happy cake day! PCP (an MD, internal medicine) told crap even quoted Rand Paul. üò≠üò≠üò≠

ETA: well may former PCP now. bad pretty good non-covid stuff. Yah. Antibodies sometimes wane eveything. Infections vaccinations. thing. think depends strain have. Last year, didn‚Äôt fatal ICU cases young adults due Alpha. like said flu-like symptoms. 

In last month due Delta, we‚Äôve seen large number ICU fatalities pre-existing condition deteriorated suddenly days. That‚Äôs concerning. Question, Florida still report Florida residents cases? counting hospitalizations deaths Florida residents? Pretty sure pulled numbers somewhere sun shine. ‚ÄúJust flu‚Äù There's difference random person saying ""it's religion"" person citing actual religious text known interpretation. 

If someone willing lie make religion spot maybe work airlines. bar certain groups beliefs vaccine religious discrimination.  read random article said viruses usually mutate ""not-that-big-a-deal""

This absolutely need case. I'm Pasco County, Florida. current positivity rate 23.3%.

My county half population vaccinated. little mask wearing. Actually, since beginning this, many people refused masks. July spike, somewhere around August last year, businesses stopped trying enforce masking indoors. dangerous counter allowed carry personal fire arms. 

At time, write, 20% public wears masks indoors. businesses gave started ""request"" masking, that's far goes. 

So tell again, doubt me? Please look profile read Urgent Care Reports. Thanks. really hate we're left flounder this. woman started tweeting months ago, gained lot traction, never seemed follow-up. ...HELLO! ANNOYING. u f*k siblings Humans really shit predicting risk probabilities. vaccine here's need know.

Breakthrough cases (that means getting covid even though vaccinated) rare. 

The chances spreading covid vaccinated breakthrough case, also rare. 

The chances ending hospital vaccinated breakthrough case, ***also*** rare. 

And course chances dying vaccinated breakthrough case, believe not, rare. 

If vaccinated well protected delta variant. Period. 

The reason masks social distancing suggested CDC, particular strain little transmissible strains. goal limit spread fast possible save lives. fully vaccinated freedom others terms keeping health. 

You feel confident hanging friends also vaxxed safe. 

You feel confident take mask eating outside restaurant (follow local guidelines). 


You feel confident risk getting covid low risk bad bout also low. vaccine save life. 


The one thing looking towards time moves booster shot. know exactly long anti-bodies last. quite possible people got vaccine Dec. Jan start immunity wane. case that's elderly nursing home folks, since first get shot. 

All confidence vaccine. things make feel comfortable freakout Covid much vaccinated. always stay informed latest information CDC. mom‚Äôs flight attendant them, glad others vaxxed working her. argument. one person understanding law another person tried best explain plain language. refuse taught. stay ignorant guess. Finally, reassuring news. get US‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs gonna get worse gets better. DeSantis variant Abbott variant? long changes mind? goes show intelligence wisdom come hand hand.  looks like still literal billions demand covid vaccine world. Australia would gladly take J&amp;J vaccines US isn‚Äôt using I‚Äôm sure. dem kids spread to. 

hestitants, become petri dish virus mutate. get delta +++ Conjunctivitis symptom though seems less I've sometimes sore eye slept funny. may headache trouble localizing. Covid R? need Trump Card ride? rhematoid arthritis mean immunocompromised.

It make wonder particular drug used rheumatoid arthritis made think outcome would better would immune though.  forget Alberta Canada! going take away testing mandatory isolation positive cases. Could wild ride seatbelts Allergic reactions risk shots unknown allergy. they're also completely treatable come right infection. Make sure someone's watching 15+ minutes dose.

The allergic component mRNA polyethylene glycol, common ingredient lot things injected body. allergic component vectored vaccines probably egg-related (from make it) likely related organic allergy.

Severe allergies definitely scary. Good luck. study non-peer reviewed Japan sample size 225.

Some quotes article:

""the average time length serums lose detectable neutralizing activity 198.3 days."" 
""BNT162b2-efficacy likely diminished detection limit 6-7 months post-1st shot""

Obviously research yet done, early indications point 3rd doses coming soon! They're also people say they're healthy need mask vaccine Romania pretty rural right?

Do active restrictions place?

Has Delta variant made way Romania? Take look around subreddit read comments. lot anecdotal stories people infected multiple times one year. order record medical journal someone would foresight run genetics virus time person came in. rate US that? saying common, far common official requirements identify individual infection different. 

Historically Coronaviruses something build long lasting strong defenses against... Covid really doesn‚Äôt seem seasonal.  It‚Äôs tough call money Florida. would watch this. allowed talk current issues repeat infection preferable vaccine booster??? Preprint articles require higher degree scrutiny rigor accurately evaluate many types articles. kind discussion would appropriate strictly scientific subreddit /r/COVID19.

The problem ""people like lockdowns"". confused? point, I'm pretty sure agency fix health insurance companies. Jack premiums refuse vaccination without valid reason. Actions consequences, feel like paying every idiot needs intubation due rank stupidity selfishness. I'm sure get downvoted dungeons, need speak peace. want return 'normal' existence science politicized, people willing fucking minimum maintain healthy population. comparing people covid 1+ year ago vs people vaccine. course vaccine wins year. year won‚Äôt winning without booster ‚ÄúSee, it‚Äôs called vaccine.

From ""We must work together"" part, sounds lot like honor system tried past months. 

 *Masks required vaccinated, we're checking. trusting people.* LOL Anyone get infected again. still pretty rare. bodies work, even anti-vax people hijacked ""natural immune response"" mentality. Covid, likely protective antibodies. good idea get vaccinated still? course, cause guaranteed dose. really dislike push though bodies suck can't make antibodies unless get vaccine. half ass measures horrible. contract spread vaccinated, proof vaccination without negative test work.

Edit:  school August? wear mask anti-masker/antivax people trustworthy take soon take yours.

It‚Äôs fine you‚Äôre vaccinated won‚Äôt hurt catch Covid, hospitals ICUs still overrun.

People don‚Äôt COVID health issues vaccinated suffer lack hospital resources don‚Äôt protect anti-vaxers/anti-maskers good well good.

Car accident? ICUs full, enjoy helicopter ride another state. Elective surgery pain/other diseases? Sorry, busy treating COVID patients, come back 6 months. wish ran CDC. Newborns vaxxed moms antibodies study saw. Plus showed cord blood birth, breast milk six weeks.

But infant immune systems undeveloped don‚Äôt think anyone knows long they‚Äôll last. move goalposts big fight people claiming genuinely held religious belief prevents getting vaccine. serious vaccine hesitancy issues they‚Äôll masking long time. bigger point countries absolutely top notch health care science general. Korea especially master class public health. 

I guess really don‚Äôt trust health authorities then? 

I‚Äôm pro-mask though, especially indoors. makes sense me. 

One question: know virus severity kids adults tends differ wildly, right? instance, varicella generally mild kids awful adults. Rsv nothing adults readily fatal young kids. Impossible know test results come back. Symptoms consistent COVID possibly viruses. Gonna lawsuits child covid, parents notified they're kid gets real sick. do!

Because literally fucking can't. mechanism so, would cause extreme inflation would threaten entire global economy. 

So, nice idea. impossible
 
Exactly like fantasy nationwide lockdown Campbell, suffers rheumatoid arthritis

*facepalm*

So, immune compromised still thought put getting vaccine. can‚Äôt even. He‚Äôs MONTHS vaccinated, head line health care workers couldn‚Äôt get around it? 

I hate see anyone suffer, I‚Äôm glad unlike some, admits wrong, damn, I‚Äôm hard time yelling void here. really, really hope excellent health insurance even excellent life insurance, 7 kids going need it. Oh ok thank clarification! Super proud you!! thank you. Disagree. She‚Äôs Friend deserves go Good Place. she‚Äôd totally get vaccinated. LAmbda deadly strain per Capita. (most deaths per 1000 confirmed infections - deadlier delta). 


It vaccine resistant. Completely different RNA structure delta doesnt mean wont get lambda. 


Delta discovered dec 2020. lambda August 2020. Albeit Delta appears infectious Lambda infectious original strain spread around world. 


Everywhere around world people letting guard - leave us wide open lambda. still protected getting first place. breaks hospitalized still orders magnitude safer bet vaxxed.  black plague black death 1400 1500's play around. Rembrandts - I'll you. want real name. new visa ?  Yeah thought reasons sense protection strong that's personaly would bet rachel antivax gullible keep seeing lot articles rise pediatric cases hospitalizations. enough data CDC come say delta affecting children ? [archive link anyone trouble accessing article much want bet doesn‚Äôt life insurance? says yes. previous wave Delta May-July (when vaccinations lower) point still stands - see asymptomatic vaccinated people spreading vaccinated people. 

This probably part Delta hard control: vaccines reduce severity symptoms point contact tracing becomes nearly impossible, since missing links getting tested. 96% physicians vaccinated believe poll done prior Delta surge. really minority, yes, among us idiots. Don't. fully vaxxed COVID like flu. might catch it, might feel miserable days, run risk severe illness, hospitalization, death. 

The reason live fear right live small children someone immune suppressed, still vulnerable. However, risk transmission still far less among vaxxed unvaxxed people around gotten shot, protected are. Also, lessens risk future variant evade vaccines. 

So really, best thing keep hard conversations anyone know declining vaccinate. *Data published Thursday US Centers Disease Control Prevention showed state led nation number adults children admitted hospitals confirmed cases Covid-19, 12,373 adults 143 children hospitalized time.*

Florida DeSantised. time delta surge we're going million immunity. I'd rather people get vaccinated, 10 million infections gets us bit close herd immunity. Clapclapclapclap He‚Äôs sub virtue signally power trip Sure, way around cases always vastly outnumber deaths. 

For example, check Romania‚Äôs stats right now. 2 new deaths 244 new cases. number cases x122 higher deaths compared Jun 29th, deaths x4 higher cases.

Again, I‚Äôm jumping conclusions. I‚Äôm saying looks real odd. areas may need masks. underreported deaths back mention happened way June 29th. way correcting mistake reporting past deaths new ones. see daily deaths represented black past ones faint yellow person right refuse inject themselves. There‚Äôs law requiring so.

But invite, allow, home don‚Äôt want use non-protected class criteria make decision. say one without vaccine gets house one without vaccine get house. Period. Surely don‚Äôt claim right owner said house.

The applies businesses. make whatever criteria want enter premises, long doesn‚Äôt discriminate protected class. businesses saying want continue employee must get shot.

You still free get shot, longer work make decision.

It‚Äôs principal employers use drug tests, dress codes, name criteria. don‚Äôt it, can‚Äôt work don‚Äôt. Compared when? Earlier summer?

Heck, even Catholics one board vaccines used cell lines testing medium option available (believe J&amp;J AZ preferred options since not). 

It's way around. mRNA vaccines need cell production, containing viruses (which needs cell replicate/produce).

The mRNA vaccines use HEK-293 test, given humans. someone problem surely problem aspirin, ibupropfen, acetaminophen, naproxen pretty much modern medicine.

The J&amp;J AZ might bit iffy Catholics, uses human cells production well (I understand use eggs production like flu vaccine, reduce possibility allergy?). cases Pope said ok take well there's alternative.

Well yeah, people want work live stuff, would trick. job good 'incentive' give except threatening take away children put people jail lol. already noted, elderly mostly vaxxed, protects vulnerable population. Also worth noting people 70+ first hand experience deadly infectious diseases younger Americans lack.

In previous waves, we've seen there's surge new positive tests first, surge hospital admissions 5-7 days later, surge deaths 7-10 days that. 

So wait bit. Sadly, deaths come. We‚Äôve proven last year safely return classroom teachers vaccinated, universal masks worn, social distancing practiced.

If school doesn‚Äôt mandate masks doesn‚Äôt try distance kids, becomes less safe. think reason seeing states ""spared"" Delta atm they've got good vaccine protection.

That's part it. part climatology environmental. northern US states time year nice outside, south hiding air-conditioning (and breathing communal air). Certain areas south also way low vaccinations. love speculation friend would get vaccine why. Lol. telling law is.

‚ÄúPeople vaccinated face much higher risk getting infected spreading disease. could lead upsurge cases, clusters many people falling sick. Unvaccinated seniors become infected also face higher risks falling seriously ill.

That delta spreading fast. may minimal symptoms none become carrier delta spreading without realizing it. 

Mask up, wash up, minimize large gatherings regardless vaccinated indoors large crowds. think lockdowns tied hospitals

The problem theory, every county hospital. CDC rating counties *Community Transmission*. couple days ago, 66 67 counties Florida ``HIGH`` (the one outlier small rural county south Florida, data sufficiently sparse undependable). north central Florida, large population county (Alachua) 3 major hospitals (NFRMC, Shands, VA), surrounding rural counties ones sending patients (because vaccination numbers stupidly low).

So propose lockdown, governor screaming *No lockdowns* ? true, sars survivors still immunity decades later think vaccinations would lot higher COVID never highly politicized misinformation allowed spread(as long downplay COVID)? Scored VIP Gold tickets Killers September ‚Äò22!

And created easy access link vaccination proof phone.

I‚Äôm totally ready! fully support plan SinoVac used? really, Whats source?

Pfizer AstraZeneca way dose delivered SinoVac, especially outside China.   perfect. friend England thinks government could better virus want show lucky moved may may ever get covid too. vaccinate possibility

If medical emergency, go hospital may die accident along way? call ambulance cloudy lightning strike may kill you? eat food possible may choke die it? pay taxes alien invasion may happen IRS busts you? Fortunately much smarter people designed vaccine, designed work vs variants. still works well vs Delta. There's reason believe freak variant appear. 

And point, like anything point, even magic vaccinate entire country right now, still takes month second dose effectiveness kick in. time Delta way out. even US would zero cases, rest world doesn't, fear variants makes little sense. go back building next year? highly doubt that. peak closer 15 August 20 August. Delta peaks much faster.   Two ways fewer unvaccinated people.

Some people help numbers hard way. (usually) way. Opinions like nipples, everybody one. firm points, others barely discernible layers, displayed every opportunity regardless whether audience stated ""I interested nipples"" not. people days tell they‚Äôre anti-cax thank service.

What, *specific*, waiting for? somewhat complex question. 

I've seeing headlines saying ""99% COVID deaths (*location*) unvaccinated people."" 

What mean debate counting COVID deaths? know people arguing over-counted comorbidity (e.g. someone COVID actually died car accident). new numbers show methodology actually useful? gets full FDA approval children, still think same? Unless course Delta infects many people able mutate vaccine, making worthless, get back square one. lived Texas too. fun place rational people... electricity. makes sad see horrible changes. closing ERs due covid surge.

US study found young people around six times likely develop myocarditis COVID Pfizer.

This key sentence me.  People getting vaxxed worry myocarditis. saying serious concern, stand chance getting covid. Peru use SinoVac, Peru 95% Pfizer.

You need check facts, making statement imagination. options would be? 7 possible vaccines. option 100% isolation intentional exposure. say? Vaccination different disease records, need vaccinated attend schools, colleges, military mountain crap. 

This new, people pretending is. C L supported mujahideen Iraq Afghanistan - Islamic guerrilla fighters, time fighting Soviet Union Afghani government. funded them, trained them, provided top-of-the-line weapons defeat ‚Äúcommies‚Äù.

At end Afghan war, Mujahid fractured bunch separate Islamic coalitions: Taliban, al-Queda, United Islamic Front larger factions.

So yes, C L trained many individuals would go lead violent, Islamic-extremist organizations, still warring power region.

Edit: apparently you‚Äôre allowed tell truth famous American origination, failures agree negative test isn‚Äôt good enough. saying, logic story, could easily said vaccines aren‚Äôt gonna cut it. said vaccinated. telling health care providers medical conditions, going bad outcomes. 

Medical professionals barred revealing patient health information. Maybe that's thinking of. comment? spreading HIV without informed consent crime right? It‚Äôs hate, logic.

Here, example, [CDC adverse events Pfizer vaccine. people talk ""adverse events"" remember event reported, later checking see somehow related vaccine. incidence Bell's Palsy higher amongst vaccinated, example, examined higher general background rate population (I randomly got 30's, cause, example showing population) there's clear mechanism explain vaccine would even cause reaction, thus assumed vaccine cause chance.

I think missed one. Maybe miscounted. Western governments hedged bets pre-ordering large quantities vaccines half dozen producers.

The Australian government chose that. went fully Astrazeneca. Partly government cheapskates, also firm Australia partnered Astrazeneca. firm allegedly close government.

Then, early year, Astrazeneca cut deliveries Australia 40-50% never got grip production issues. production AZ Australia also bogged production shortfalls.

And meantime, blood-clot issue arose, throwing Australia's one-horse strategy disarray. even lots Astazeneca spare, could use young people. submission automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

There's grumbling still, relative USA we're pretty unified around responsible considerate one another regards Covid. know strategy would work anywhere without high vaccination rates decently unified public page masks distancing independent government mandates. explained yourself, wearing masks effectively prevents outward spread. mask mandates helps prevent outward spread. Even everyone wears mask correctly, helps great deal EVERYONE required wear one.  Big I'm-not-a-baby-I'm-a-big-kid energy.

HIPAA protects patient care provider giving information without consent. nothing asking employee, customer, student complete stranger prove medical procedure. prove broke spine 27 years ago get blue parking sticker, show vaccine card shop grocery store. Companies required offer ""religious exemption"" all.

It's much simpler offer it, trying parse way they'd get trouble.

To certain extent, healthcare facilities probably offer medical exception patient contact workers either. unsafe someone get vaccine, unsafe job - ADA requires reasonable accomidation, unreasonable ones. offer transfer non contact role maybe, get see patients unvaxed, PERIOD. ‚Äúit,‚Äù mean constituents?

There's intersection fundamentalist Christian/politically conservative types believe every conspiracy vaccine, additionally believe taking vaccine would mean admitting faith God's protection.

 antivaxxers hate moment kick leg one main arguments. folks truly hesitant start roll sleeves hardcore antivax crowd lose credibility. Yeah illiberal policy. one illiberal policy means county ""not democracy"" clearly Australia still is. democracies test bounds time time - Britain certainly does.

It's completely believable many legit posts are, thank goodness, often due vaccine, they're share rather hospital tube throat. Holy crap!! arguing step brother regarding this. said thing..that ""we need vaccine, we're 99% immune"", showed daily data state..21 people died non vaccinated. shifted covid protocol hospitals..that must injecting something otherwise die.

Be well  Cries Australian. \~15% fully vaccinated. Well fair first case Louisiana, first US. It‚Äôs found US states before, seems getting beat Delta. wanting mandate vaccinating children keeping children safe trying keep adults safer right? Fair enough, children already proven spread COVID less adults extremely debatable whether risks vaccines worth  constantly exposed, best answer likely asymptomatic case. Also possible may resistant whatever reason. course, there's also huge element randomness. Take large enough population, someone (or multiple someones) everything wrong still lucky.   Good  luck, one anywhere near me. suspect surprised. ""Help"" still weak word. hard reconcile, emotional sense, masks help people wear masks still end dying. think stronger statement, backed compelling evidence, would ""masks save lives"".

Edit: clarity Oh know. 73% adults country already overweight Covid started it‚Äôs like lockdown changed stuff much. already easy overweight America lockdown not. Lockdowns made little easier wanted be. paper says can, reality vastly different. allow around 3,000 people inside country week people rich businesspeople rich people afford first class. want economy? You‚Äôre stuffed. yesterday another law written state Australian flies country, even they‚Äôre permanently resided abroad, they‚Äôll need governmental exemption fly again. exemption government full rights deny, meaning cannot leave go home again, thus making even harder enter first place. Finally, delta kicked India, government literally made illegal Australians fly back country. Illegal!  worse last year? Vaccines available. Unless stating people anti-vaxxers. Also, work much hoped beg question though whether future strains even milder symptoms aggregate. Hopefully eventually reach level (vaccinated acquired immunity) results COVID effectively common cold everyone. actually encouraging see post downvotes like would last year. like they're basically asking leave another job, smh.  get hit car there's significant triage? completely agree you.

However, remember 58% *eligible* Americans fully vaccinated 68% least partially vaccinated. principle, able get almost people fully vaccinated.

Of course, boggles mind 90%+ eligible Americans fully vaccinated. like, y'all live year did? think main concern people country go particular rally may lead outbreaks US like happened last year. Absolutely - there‚Äôs ton room health fitness preventative approach medicine, use vaccines modern medicine.

Good food, exercise, fitness prevent disease first place. Vaccines greater good get us covid mess. Medicine fix could prevent.  Miami basically another country compared rest Florida. try see angles voice reason. 

That said‚Ä¶ fuck politicians. honest, we're past point even considering lockdowns feel.

Why would mandate scientific? scientific goal eradicating virus would greatly aided requiring vaccinations, no?

Mandates tool reach specific end. significant number vaccinated people slow spread, case. get muddy due intersection medicine politics, fail see claim mandate serves scientific purpose. guess right, thought anti vaxxers theres lot smart people (who believe vaccines) delayed feel like rest society getting protect them. That's need vaccine mandates schools, govt jobs, hospitals, service workers, etc.

Also feel like countries like Israel UK geographic logistical advantage since they're small. easily get small communities get vaccinated great usage time. pretty fucking naive lmao agree points. Nothing else matters trying save kid death serious illness. trumps everything else.

The flip side would be: data currently showed say, 75% new COVID deaths came unvaccinated people, would mean lot vaccinated people dying COVID. would mean either vaccine ineffective, we're miscounting somehow. fact case mean indeed counting correctly? 

I'm smart statistics maybe dumb question, logically seems like kind news proof claims counting exaggerated. wonder also kind war fueled foriegn governments well. vaccinated people still catch spread Delta variant fine

Vaccinated people catch much less spread much less. 

Like everything pandemic, gradient. Masks protect 100%, keeping distance protect 100% vaccines protect 100%.

But much safer around masked people unmasked ones. Much safer socially distanced group crowded bar. Much safer around vaccinated people unvaccinated. That's fine, think fair say slows spread virus ""the beginning end debate"".

With Delta, seen estimates 90 95% population needs vaccinated happen. US reached 50% nationally. Globally, something like 15%.

So, vaccinations definitely good thing helping keep people hospital worse, I'm sure overall case rates going change much, especially since dealing much virulent variant 2020. far summer far past case rates saw last summer. think winter somehow better last winter, though would thrilled wrong.

This exactly vaccines reduced efficacy Delta: infectious, replicates quickly, body takes long (in some/most cases) mount antibody response via cells, get infection. also people recently vaccinated, therefore high antibody titers (these naturally wane time, left cells) much better fighting infection crazy replication scenario. boosters recommended, top antibody titers.

I've seen reports say studies finding similar Delta viral loads vaccinated unvaccinated. true? so, unvaccinated responsible latest surge? That's passed. comes 6m-5y range double trickier. study may last 6m-9m      PHILADELPHIA ‚Äî sweltering July afternoon, Solomon Carson, 6, jumped stoop family‚Äôs tidy rowhouse West Philadelphia, full father, David, called ‚Äúunspent energy.‚Äù

When stranger asked name, answered brightly, added couldn‚Äôt spell it. ‚ÄúI help that,‚Äù father said, patiently pronouncing letter, Solomon repeating him.

Solomon supposed learned basics kindergarten past year, first year formal education anything but.
When Covid-19 closed classrooms, parents chose enroll city schools already doubts about. working, decided teach home along two older brothers. signed virtual charter school advertised in-person tutoring ‚Äî failed provide it.

Now, Solomon heads first grade, Mr. Carson cleareyed son stands academically. ‚ÄúI really think improve,‚Äù said.

Solomon part vast exodus local public schools.

As pandemic upended life United States, one million children expected enroll schools show up, either person online. missing students concentrated younger grades, steepest drop kindergarten ‚Äî 340,000 students, according government data.

Now, first analysis enrollment 70,000 public schools across 33 states offers detailed portrait kindergartners. shows pandemic lay bare vast disparities health care income, also hardened inequities education, setting back vulnerable students spent even one day classroom.
The analysis New York Times conjunction Stanford University shows 33 states, 10,000 local public schools lost least 20 percent kindergartners. 2019 2018, 4,000 schools experienced steep drops.

The months closed classrooms took toll nearly students, families levels income education scrambled help children make gaps. startling declines neighborhoods poverty line, average household income family four $35,000 less. drop 28 percent larger schools communities rest country.

In Philadelphia school district, almost students low-income families, kindergarten enrollment declined quarter fall 2019 fall 2020. drop three times national rate, accounting 2,700 students.

While kindergarten optional many states, educators say great substitute quality, in-person kindergarten. many students, it‚Äôs introduction school. taught cooperate identify numbers letters. learn early phonics number sense ‚Äî concept bigger smaller quantities.

And kindergarten often children first diagnosed disabilities like autism spectrum disorder.

Yet country‚Äôs poorest neighborhoods, tens thousands 6-year-olds begin first grade missed traditional kindergarten experience.

‚ÄúWe deeply concerned,‚Äù said Thomas S. Dee, professor Stanford Graduate School Education, worked Times analysis.

The data covered two-thirds public schools.

It showed remote schooling main factor driving enrollment declines. widespread Covid is, thought would know lot people it. don‚Äôt personally know anyone died hospitalized.

My grandfather grandmother got it, aunt, cousins, father friends got it. got bedridden like week done.

And it‚Äôs still minority, family friends didn‚Äôt get it. we‚Äôre anything special either, wearing masks trying keep hands clean. It‚Äôs like family avoided events anything like that. feel like need /s emotional damage cloth mask cause. anything untrue 3 parts statement. 1) lag ‚Äúmath‚Äù irrelevant; 2) cool fun living forever, hope one care dies! right choose tricky communicable diseases. war! disease turns cells weapon development platform. successful, cranks new, improved version evade defenses completely, much higher lethality boot.  expense deaths far nothing. Wasted. Meaningless. 

If body tolerate vaccination, get it, voluntarily not. can't allowed betray human race ignorance ""feelings"".

If isolation place, say Antarctica (but without cold), people want vaccination could go to, would great. Let choose enemy can't kill humanity. Unfortunately, exist. Perhaps worth noting one gave unvaccinated mother. choices impact people deal consequences. business owner decides want people business vaccinated freewill choice. 

Because choose vaccinated mean people cater you. That's read words. I'm Texas, know exactly kind people he's talking about. identify them, like them, left state surround different people. still know they're like. still know situation volatile, lots things might make volatile.

I think saw needed see dismiss perspective try mock him, went it.

From read seem aligned. Yes people forced law take medication want take.

Are going force blood transfusions needed even though goes religion beliefs. agree masks work.

However, sustaining mask mandates extended periods time might bad people's mental health, result reduced compliance.

I agree definitely factor epidemiology behavior making COVID policy. masks way go terms mitigation, need best sell them. one way might emphasize status temporary inconvenience, permanent norm.  end day, employees spreading potentially lethal virus back forth causes staff take time, become hospitalized, require better benefits packages covering COVID. Wearing masks (not bandanas tissues chin-warmers) getting vaccinated free prevents things happening expenses accruing. Simple logic. IMO, valid medical reason exempt vaccine requirement, required mask well.

Honestly, feel like vaccinated people get tested regularly well, less often allowed freedoms we're still wave.  bad compared chicken pox flu?  isn‚Äôt last year though. dealing completely different threat now. Delta many times infectious point masks might enough prevent spread environment hundreds unvaccinated people crammed indoors together. imagine seeing lot sick kids time around.

I know plenty people lingering side effects ranging minimal severe Covid tho. go ahead, roll dice.

Well would guess done lives pretty much every illness death sentence. know would continue masking, socially distancing taking immunity Plenty things restricted health reasons. can't drive/operate heavy machinery taking certain medications

Because open maybe business liability pay put film workers test positive stds can't work

Because knowingly giving someone else illness opens bussiness liability amateur places like California actually need tell people sleep STD. Linking covid. people covid always know it. definitely health-based restrictions. one those. get vaccinated. like go restaurants. work certain companies. fly airplane.

Then let bussinesses make decision government forcing private bussiness places.

For starters can't churches goes first amendment.

So vaccinate everyone everything contagious? people 15 different vaccine passports people may pass illness someone else? die droves. owning me. Notice event ""normies"" called super spreader event here, mass protests last year magically not. People blatantly fall cultural wars without looking stats. Ignore comment actually screwed up, reason thought July 31 7 days ago compared August 6. compared August 6 July 30, therefore cases slowing much would like. Good luck finding another job fat pension like that.

What dumb hill die on! article seems pretty fair-minded. puts spotlight Christian Nationalists, note ideology especially prevalent among evangelicals. also makes point acknowledging many evangelicals subscribe this, highlights evangelical leaders support vaccination many high-profile evangelical leaders acknowledge maintain personal biblical integrity also supporting scientific breakthroughs connecting see wonders God‚Äôs universe science.  example, Francis Collins, head National Institutes Health devoted evangelical Christian, said: ‚ÄúThe church, time confusion, ought beacon, light hill, entity believes truth.‚Äù  great moment church say, matter well intentioned someone‚Äôs opinions may be, they‚Äôre based upon fact, church endorse them.‚Äù

[U.S. Evangelical Leaders Preach Covid Vaccine Benefits cancelled mid August trip Florida booked cases lowest June.  So. state full morons.   pretty bold claims here. evidence (or even most) anti-vaxxers ‚Äúdoing hurt us‚Äù? would even work, considering effective vaccines severe covid? seems like they‚Äôd mostly hurting fellow unvaccinated adults.

Averting public health crisis one thing. Explicitly targeting unvaccinated different. simply feels good inflict pain others. isn‚Äôt productive reasonable. rots inside. 

I‚Äôm tired talking this. Feel free reply, I‚Äôm going get back you. Maybe full scale collapse, certainly reached worrying levels many counties 10% available ICU beds.  Bye bye   touches friends family

This threshold holdouts made lives difficult past 18 months. self-centered society right thing benefits stop longer does.  seems logical me. Even based responses. lot people responding seem think point reasonable notion natural infections give level immunity vaccine.....it's like shit talking vaccine something.

Seems like get vaxxed either way, least booster previous infection Well people dying plenty opportunity wear masks, social distance, get vaccine refused things. ones dying moronic beliefs hard much sympathy change whole life protect someone dumb protect themselves. Well considering 25 kids died... numbers vast underestimation. fear mongering. looking logically. want use real deaths 18 July 21. going get worse better. religion. invented it. It‚Äôs worship tacos. Alabama‚Äôs COVID-19 deaths reported widespread availability vaccine. Nearly 11,000 deaths occurred April 1. Dude really don‚Äôt think get south. I‚Äôm wealthiest county entire state GA outside metro Atlanta. industry county. factories, one fast food franchise, that‚Äôs it. 

Where think money comes from? It‚Äôs old, old, old slave money. friend high school lived trailer. parents literal millions liquid. It‚Äôs hard tell 100k redneck 100m red neck.

I wouldn‚Äôt surprised 5% legal machine guns county, hand god.

Edit: count West Virginians hillbillies, southerners. fine distinction, one I‚Äôm sure appreciate sort thing people say they‚Äôve real idea they‚Äôre saying. Vacation boat rentals fully booked forever. Austraila used series short, hard lockdowns strict quarantine policy. borders basically closed 18 months. system worked considered model managing epidemic. However, it‚Äôs sustainable long run. many vaccine hesitant people US know that‚Äôs gonna lead. outsider, see train wreck coming. Internally, epidemic worsens mitigation efforts seem less effective, blaming leadership problem rest world knows it‚Äôs really beyond leadership stop crisis. hard year so. Realistically, off-ramp here? get point we're comfortable moving pandemic?

It felt like summer relaxed masking rules supposed off-ramp. transitioning back normalcy. Cases real-life returning. CDC switched back Delta running rampant (understandable) seem like anyone plan anymore.

I guess real question this. delta last wave *substance*? Like case count (that continue) mean US realistically likely last wave cause freakout, masking restrictions whole 9 yards. top that, long current CDC mask mandates around?

I'm breaking point now. lost senior year high school, first year college, feel like I'm going lose second year well. family members need get married pushed back wedding twice. can't take it. Got source prove caused nationwide outbreaks? Alabama‚Äôs COVID-19 deaths reported widespread availability vaccine. Nearly 11,000 [11,600] deaths occurred April 1.

If you‚Äôre going quote numbers, exclude this? Sure, reason believe delta causing ""long covid"" different rate variants.

There evidence might result severe disease children, evidence (a) conclusive yet (b) importantly, essentially independent whether incidence long covid changes.

Mild cases result long covid frequently severe cases adults.   Good. Let people don‚Äôt understand basic science self-select positions authority. Anyone dumb enough understand vaccine science irrationally scared enough want one position arrest shoot people. don‚Äôt let mentally ill police officers. anti-vaxers. can‚Äôt stand far stupidity/fear allowed progress thin veneer ‚Äúchoice.‚Äù year. Lessons learned. like major parts world haven't. Regardless, initial testing showed vaccine evasion splashed across news stories Illicit fear *not* vaccines used US. Primary care physicians tend know much stuff. doctors not. wrote reply didn‚Äôt realise account new post. still curious, hey said.


There different beliefs seen people still don‚Äôt want vaccine.

The first ‚ÄúGetting vaccine makes likely miscarry I‚Äôm pregnant/I want get pregnant.. Yes, see study indicates vaccine doesn‚Äôt change miscarriage rates, study misinterpreting data/the study covering three months women got vaccine clearly hiding fact women got vaccine first trimester healthy baby.‚Äù

The second ‚ÄúI‚Äôm young healthy get Covid won‚Äôt big deal I‚Äôm going bother getting vaccine/researching vaccine.

Other people believe natural immunity better would rather children get COVID likely cause serious problems forever immunity get vaccine know long immunity last.

The collection opinions see among people interact real life. think still people believe conspiracy government lying numbers doctors lying cause death. would assume 95 percent unvaccinated. chose take chances virus ample opportunity get vaccinated against.  Athletes beating door get vaccinated , athletic level damage covid performs lungs able perform field may career-ending .  


  
losing step two NFL due vaccinated? that's gonna great payoff .  wish CDC jumped gun changing recommendations May.

Why? time, data showed fine. Congratulations Dragon King Dragon people. Im imagining virus entering body like one psycho sorority cheer videos. viral particles stacked one another chanting , clapping, throwing jazz hands    probably would, hunt sympathy, can't imagine older family members so. Me: Let's look data points.

You: Ya, *one* data point? Buddha made entity used military juntas hold military juntas.  least appears easy way tighten them. hold breath. FDA took long weekend Thanksgiving last year eyes desperately looked first EUA setting new case records daily. bureaucrats move one. Even Delta, kids still affected extremely low rates. large study also published week showing kids unlikely suffer long covid. We‚Äôre gonna stupid kids pandemic ends.  keep seeing articles, feels lot like articles last year similar people saying bars/restaurants/shaking-hands would *never* come back.

It seems like people continuing great summer enjoying themselves. offer acceptable!     Exactly. manipulated data. Show death rates since June.  That's want know assume short staffing adds problem  Oh no. religious war Pastafarians! case I'm terrified needles I'm taking it. diff form, like pill shit I'd gladly take many times decide move goal post. getting needle though. worship tacos.

How join?  Living Tampa, I‚Äôve gone like 7 pharmacies, NOBODY take-home test stock :(  requirements becoming officer nearly strict enough. one many clear signs. Way attribute mostly luck ""successful strategy."" Pre-pandemic many humans avoid influenza, colds, contagious ailments without masks social distancing, full concerts office buildings time frame pandemic active. lot built immunity viruses. There's literally point ""hold off"" vaccination.  known illnesses vaccines, prove individual basis. medical records create bigger picture wherein know percent population vaccinated, herd immunity exists. intelligent. Unintelligent people see change proof weakness. pretty stupid mentality even religious. someone Catholic rising, yeah, taught accept death come day able anything accept God's plan, mean reject medicine jump recklessly towards death. Refusing vaccine (and helping others taking vaccines, especially vaccine lucky people poor countries access vaccination) like bad least understanding Christianism.

""God help people help themselves"" pretty common saying here.  wow ok much? IMO poor countries happily bunch vaxx them, problem always richer countries selfish greedy helping now...well, least massive quantity, right? yes, know July 2nd link found got exact number. Meanwhile, states actually give shit this, testing still free, state encourages people get tested return travelling. HCQ would cure got sick, could drink bleach shine UV light butt? Large organizations change slowly. I‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs right that‚Äôs things work.   Lmao clearly missed point. downplayed consequences vaccine 3 deaths (that privilege knowing about). people paid ultimate price, something that‚Äôs suppose save illness like 3% mortality rate worldwide.. unnecessary, think  looks like Abbott one adopted child. took death-of-the-first-born plagues work. Then, God ended asshole changed Pharaoh's mind, pointless anyway. we're stuck Matzah Passover. Everyone sucks. administered well 780 million doses Pfizer/Moderna globally

I think comes ""YET"" part. Maybe miracle nothing comes maybe 1 year goes flames. believe hesitancy vocal antivax group vaccines general hesitancy one since developed approved quickly. that's vaccinations right?  K bye   become unvaccinated FDA approves fully? idiotic organization considers pizza vegetable Someone /r/Nursing posted patient intubated wearing shirt.  Subunit. phase 3 right now, really hope pass final test. got Pfizer, think I‚Äôm going try get J&amp;J momentum stays like devastating me. need vaxxed ASAP  company funny way.   type vaccine it? Good them, hope works well!! Wow prove everyone vaccines. 10 different vaccine passports trust people vaccine  Good! Take out!!! cant speak outside US maybe ambulance chasing lawyers plenty drugs received FDA approval seemingly long get pulled lawyers come out. something think answer question article poses. 840,000 total doses, 582,000 first doses. Big jumps last Saturday total shots (712,000) first shots (473,000)

7 day average first shots highest since June 18th.

The share 12-16 year olds getting first shot double month ago. free education taxpayers paying schools unless giving tax rebate something allowing access schools paying for. ""Screw article. I'll get info comment section"" attitude literally source major issues going world right now. I'm vaccinated. would push look another job. I'm big fan group punishments boss someone want work for.

I fuck up. deal shit? Let covidiots refuse vaccination deal consequences decisions. little kids/immunocompromised wear masks social distance. Yikes.

You can't things putting people risk, yes. issue. 

If protect people, cost restricting things others (without impeding health, mind you) think government back this. 

Most every big contagious disease vaccine ages, sufficient herd immunity. not, makes exception. That's still less half auto deaths auto deaths people *under twelve*. Auto accidents also kill regardless comorbidities. going get worse better.

We vaccines people twelve now, matter time they're approved twelves too.
If number cited double 6 months, would number auto deaths per year *two years*, still half risk. Looking raw numbers =/= looking logically. still looking lens fear.  ""cHiLrEn iMmUnE!"" crowd one end crazy spectrum, totally risk averse ""OMG children *might* die"" spectrum crazy. Everything worth life involves risk, even children. Telling people small (and due vaccines, vanishing) risk literally fear mongering. stopped funny like month ago. Oh wow. job announced mandate it, we're waiting find details see antivaxxers try get around it. stats again, shut J&amp;J research gave blood clots 5% rate birth control?

‚ÄúThEY doNt CAre DIe!!!!!!‚Äù

Lmao  Billions we‚Äôre 50% fully vaccinated US point 59% one dose? 

Assuming everyone recently got first dose goes back second dose, like 60% fully vaxxed September October? I‚Äôm confused? Haha I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôre kindest, best cops force too. San Fran‚Äôs finest. Lmao Similar rates both, main difference Covid tends affect older kids flu flu chicken pox vaccine reduce odds contracting disease. point I'm fed up. I've anti-vaxxers. wanna take vaccine? Fine, please lock home time-being instead helping prolong pandemic! 

Corporations, first-world countries, vaccines underdeveloped nations? Stop selfish hoarding vaccines actually share once! Instead letting expire anti-vaxxers wanna take them, send abroad! I'm sure many countries would happy take them. I'll call test subject. Please come back let us know catch and/or get sick. Hopefully honest do. 100% pro vaccine mandates completely agree sentiment. Biden use military enforce things like Australia does. It‚Äôs heavily reported it‚Äôs gonna bad Please, proceed deputies. Please, proceed. People able evaluate individual risk decide things worth them.

The hospitalization rate (even young-ish people) always ~5%. vaccine reduces factor 25, means vaccinated, hospitalization rate around 0.2% 1 500. death rate much lower.

1 500 low enough that, people, events might worth it.

But 1 500 also zero even infintessimal. guess years. feel like new world us cure virus. I‚Äôm pessimist though. Lol 20-30 million, multiple 5 according CDC. would like hear suggestions next stage instead complaining bad things mention, child support determined formula. OP‚Äôs income time child hasn‚Äôt changed, child support doesn‚Äôt change. study Singapore comparing people infected Delta unvaccinated vaccinated. average vaccinated person reaches RT-PCR Ct value 30 (considered low risk transmission) 8 days compared 14 days unvaccinated.

It seems like aren‚Äôt enough antibodies prevent infection circumstances (warning antibodies long exposure high viral loads). Delta overwhelm existing antibodies pure number virions, pre-existing immunity takes couple days b-cells t-cells kick in.  comprehend hypocrite continue trend every scenario?

Sidewalks worthless less 1 person run one. wasn‚Äôt sidewalk wouldn‚Äôt there. wonder person feels.

Crosswalks worthless less 1 person run crossing street.

Doctors worthless, less 1 person killed malpractice.

Seatbelts worthless caused less 1 death.

Vehicles worthless less 1 person died them.

I wonder people feel. Yeah addressed exactly point. 

Since April 1st 1,100 deaths Alabama *at most* 26 vaccinated people according state health data. means *at least* 97.5% deaths since April 1 unvaccinated. It‚Äôs probably actually. Old article 2 July. Donations ramped immensely past five weeks.  talk sense you‚Äôre willing? I‚Äôm someone anti-vaxx per se, Mom super anti-vaxx, growing immersed belief system left w fear unknown unexpected long term consequences vaccines. Vet, developed theory based observations practice vaccinations causing increased health problems animals. got serious cancer attributed vaccine gotten period preceding dramatic onset it, felt like vaccine caused reaction body contributed speed intensity cancer. explain Moms skill observation, could observe animals, touch animal, come w super accurate diagnosis, world class instincts. That‚Äôs part reason can‚Äôt let go, wrong stuff seemed good instincts there.

Here's pay walled article. good graphs showing state state impact... 


In first big test Covid- 19 vaccines Covid-19 surge, places higher vaccination rates dodging worst outcomes far, cases hospitalizations surge less-vaccinated areas.

There tests yet come, including cold weather forces people well-vaccinated Northeast back indoors. highly contagious Delta strain tears country, trends thus far suggest vaccines turn Covid-19 less dangerous, manageable disease.

‚ÄúVaccines definitely make difference,‚Äù said David Dowdy, epidemiologist Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School Public Health.

A Wall Street Journal analysis shows sharp geographic divides vaccination hospitalization levels, every state above-average vaccine rate showing below-average hospitalizations, including well-vaccinated New England. South, meanwhile, fewer people vaccinated average hospitalization rates climbing faster.

The Delta-driven surge unlike predecessors U.S. variant spreads easily confronting partially vaccinated population. U.S. needed extra month reach President Biden‚Äôs goal getting 70% adults least one shot July 4. vaccination rates picking up, states remain behind mark.
The Centers Disease Control Prevention says fully vaccinated people much less likely hospitalized die people similar risk factors aren‚Äôt vaccinated. Vaccines also reduce risk fully vaccinated people getting infected transmitting virus, agency says, though somewhat less Delta previous variants.

Delta‚Äôs relatively recent emergence complications, like slowed data collection many states, made difficult fully understand connection new cases deaths may changing, health experts say.

Delta‚Äôs earlier surge U.K. offers clues. January, cases largely unvaccinated U.K. peaked near 60,000 day, daily mortality counts topped 1,200. recently, U.K. yet see full effects case surge neared 48,000 late July, deaths hovering around 80 day.

Cases rising around U.S. summer Delta became dominant Covid-19 variant, effects including rising mortality levels pronounced counties weaker vaccination rates. Vaccination rates higher parts country tend experience colder winters saw less transmission last summer, New England, epidemiologists think could pressure fall.

The people risk Covid-19 inoculated: According CDC, 80% people 65 older fully vaccinated, compared 50% total population.

This focus vaccinating elderly first appeared reduce Covid-19 related deaths. December, winter surge mass vaccination, Americans ages 75 represented 63% Covid-19 deaths several weeks. recently, number hovered near 40%, CDC data show.

‚ÄúThe elderly greatly protected higher vaccination rates, population getting overwhelmingly sick younger folks,‚Äù said Manoj Jain, infectious disease physician Rollins School Public Health Emory University.

During Delta surge, however, younger people aren‚Äôt thoroughly vaccinated flooding hospitals. states 25 hospitalizations per 100,000 residents past week, hospitalization numbers roughly levels peaks January, ages different.

‚ÄúWhat data tell even 22 years old, I‚Äôd scared wasn‚Äôt vaccinated,‚Äù said Philip Landrigan, epidemiologist directs Program Global Public Health Common Good Boston College. 79-year-old fully vaccinated.
Even though vaccinated people catch cases spread Covid-19, data suggest vaccines provide protection infection transmission. Santa Clara County, Calif., recent seven-day average daily cases among vaccinated people roughly 6.8 per 100,000 people Aug. 4; case rate among unvaccinated nearly four times higher.  Link please can't find ty heard statistics, that's really great hear. black community hit harder others pandemic I'm glad vaccination rates going haven‚Äôt likely won‚Äôt point slow current spread onky happen people stay away infectious period. People going voluntarily wear masks voluntarily. unfortunate truth witnessed pandemic. Yeah 50% lot likely. basically taking gamble every time see someone. Interestingly we're seeing Northeast, surge due delta lot restrained vs parts country lower vaccination rates. Nah I‚Äôm vaccinated part continue enjoy summer. people ridiculous. seatbelt laws still accidents? gun restrictions still mass shootings? Hmmm ü§î really hard concept grasp, know. there's us can't get vaccinated get treated antivaxxers jump hoops perpetuity. What's legal background?  Fuck Yeah!

There's lot variation fast spread different American countries, they're trying figure (it could related vaccines used know yet.) hospital work already warned us mandate employees coming moment full approval arrives.

Right moment? even five weeks after, give latecomers bit time actually get shots? Plenty Harleys need new owner's sale months come.  excuse getting applied job required it.

also keep mind cases US delta, % (80? 90?) math figuring likely breakthrough would bit complicated Hehe, totally. Maybe meant Easter 2023!! Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection causes spectrum respiratory illness, asymptomatic mild fatal. MERS-CoV is¬†transmitted sporadically dromedary camels humans occasionally human-to-human contact understanding, vaccine transmission goal marker set, vaccine effective, therefore transmission. Flattening curve biding best could hope for.

So would agree masks effective reducing transmission failing lies portions population ignore/disregard mandate and/or behave irresponsibly, correct?

In words: pointless mandate people follow, therefore, bother mandate. Right? think vast majority people arnt effected covid yet are.  Yes sorry - say feel awful children immunosuppressed can‚Äôt get vaccine.

At point time risk viral infection WAY greater risk vaccine.


Get vaccine. I'm letting live, get vaccinated. UK, different variants. proof delta hits children severely. Thanks that. Interesting see disparity older uptake. Although Belgium near top older uptake looks problematic. 5 look well set. outcome really predictable. CDC needs hire social scientists...or even anyone has, like, paid attention people behaved past 18 months. link actual study? contrary everything seen, actual  I've gotta viral load right here... I‚Äôm done too. someone gets sick dies refused vaccine made choice. It‚Äôs problem. I‚Äôm sorry kids 12 health issues. mad anti-vaxxers, rest us.  Hi UN! What's difference someone anti-vax someone makes stats side? lot. forget Missouri. We're far fucked others.  Sympathy, compassion, teamwork care others silver bullet. exposed. lack basic human characteristics required shut virus. thrives flourishes worst characteristic. Selfishness. better think point Concerts Events,etc people planning schedules around.. cancelled. Yea don‚Äôt idea talking about. 

While institutions fallible, science CRYSTAL CLEAR different aspects last 18 months: masks undeniably help reduce spread transmission COVID, vaccines prevalent US safe effective. items studied multiple institutions across entire globe. answer always same: vaccine safe everyone get able protect others. believe ANYTHING differently means you, without qualifications ability conduct study, decided know hundreds thousands doctors scientists across entire globe. That, me, prime pseudo-intellectualism. Belief skepticism anything bullshit pseudoscience.

So unless massive, mean MASSIVE, coordinated conspiracy theory involving dozens institutions hundreds thousands individuals, wrong business discussing topic. I'm starting wonder jackass owns bunch funeral homes. Mandates based rock solid science. work, sure, science put yet. (source- one first 40,000 vaccinated last August) plan clearly outlined. Wait Pfizer arrive isn‚Äôt far start vaccinating. thresholds reached open up. lockdowns still reasonable option 6 months get everyone vaccinated Get vaccinated wear mask indoors.

Vaccination works!
'‚Ä¢ rate COVID-19 unvaccinated individuals higher compared fully vaccinated individuals. trend remained consistent time (Figure 2).
‚Ä¢ past 30 days, unvaccinated individuals approximately 8.0 times likely become case COVID-19 compared fully vaccinated individuals (Figure course does. He‚Äôs deep go roads now. Weird keeps happening right? People often forget real struggles went back day justify reactions modern day.

This happens things like civil rights movements time justify people think protests unheard quiet things stick corners. Nope. Protests work, often loud, extremely inconvenient.

Likewise, here, iirc (and program drawing parallels pandemic early 20th century), people relatively similar reactions previous pandemics well. Politicians wanting push mask wearing, people caring, slow rollouts everything.

This new surprise. basically expect people react. keep kid bubble? They‚Äôre risk flu every year. risk hit walking school. Life full risks. hope vaccines get approved 12s really soon! feel bad kids waiting life get back normal. gotta hardest them. still learning much world gets thrown upside know many really understand why. gotta really hard confusing.   fastest mutating virus history  Cool thanks. best types reusable masks? see lot fancy nano filter masks like halolife.io. claim independent testing such. think Damn seriously strong data. lotta wiggle room there..

Fuck political tensions, people. Pay attention numbers data. prefer refer pro-COVID faction. proudly vaccinated &amp; masking parents. 
We kept kids home last year. need back school year learn lessons don‚Äôt come books. need grow peers. us, it‚Äôs excruciating decision make!!! also say hell evil you! Right?! Felt like tickled brain. issue common cold? can't stop it? vaccinated individuals infected, especially compared unvaccinated. 

If achieve herd immunity vaccination, nobody would wear masks. look Springfield, MO this. deaths piling up. Missouri delayed reporting numbers Cox Health Mercy Springfield show every week many people leave ICUs body bags. It‚Äôs primary way empty 6-8 weeks climbing numbers. They‚Äôre finally seeing small declines state‚Äôs urban areas climb. want try shift perspective little bit. people *care*. *understand*. Science intellectualism general ridiculed decades well-read is, some, something contemptible rather admirable. 

For us understanding reality negative health consequences resulting e.g. food intake, dietary choice, lack exercise, etc. may *appear* people care, assure what's going on. brainwashed ignorance they're happy understanding world around them, understanding makes lives simple eliminates personal responsibility degree. I'm dumber now...so, better sure nothing correlation mask mandates community spread. correlation, though studies found masks effective reducing spread COVID.

We're talking two different things. It‚Äôs outdoor transmission risk fraction indoor. believe well established year now. Close proximity 400k people certainly riskier 500 people park like they‚Äôre inside. think you‚Äôre right. soon FDA fully approves hammer going drop. Downvoted? look like me. thinking similarly, another example corporate press brought GE, etc... looked contact info new site actually Hanoi. think case actually Vietnamese using ""home grown"" proud way.  Right, last Monday, masking longer option. Vaccine allowed company property last week.

Edit: Part came people refuse wear masks. factory work, hot, people hate wearing masks sweating, are.  Steven Soderbergh make sequel movie 'Contagion', Matt Damon watches another billion people die they're stupid take vaccine. would want parent this. shitbaggery incredible. create GOP voters! Imagine thinking can't get large portion Americans wear throw away mask going get wear either N95s TWO masks. Come on. table right [this shows long mask particular type prevent getting infectious dose.

In comparable situations, cloth masks protect 20 mins. Surgical masks 30 minutes. Ill-fitting N95 works 150 minutes. Well-fitting N95 protect 1,500 minutes.


(This study done Delta times lower still compare mask types other) get saying little sympathy research people. 

So portion group people, sympathy whole group people? Thats completely unreasonable, furthermore, point simply abandoning group people everyone taking booster shots variants till die medical companies nice boost stock prices. Yes, many people wilfully unvaccinated. Hospitals states decent vaccination rates seeing kinds crises. blame him, many others will. He's literally posturing 2024 election bid, such, held accountable. People vote stupid stunts poor Covid response. Last week said something along lines ""I want hear Covid response Biden locked border"" grandstanding. People hear that, agree message. Yeah, increased deaths long term health consequences people fault, sure celebrated even ""protection freedoms"" whatever BS lie feeding masses.  Exact situation here, also Canada. can't keep young kids home anymore. me, handle it, 6 4, desperately need go back school kids. feels like shitty choice matter do.  Wait, I‚Äôm confused. vaccine doesn‚Äôt stop viruses getting inside infecting cells, many say vaccines reduce risk getting infected? understand vaccines reduce symptoms thought also prevented infection! wrong? shitty parents?

Parents required law children attend school.

Schools doubling returning in-person education year.

Parents frequently rely public schools serve childcare go work put food table.

I‚Äôm sure part shitty except position parents put in. shouldn‚Äôt. Screw people. Don‚Äôt cancel damn thing them. thanks AZ!   kids still risk getting covid even vaccinated. Even bit less risk today. Gotta let live point. I'm sure vaccinated. (can't believed typed that). announced months ago vaccines would eventually required, wear facemask.

See that's far reasonable lot people suggesting reasonable.

Companies absolute minimum effect possible/necessary operate dealing employee's healthcare. Ideally it'd one big single payer system could stay completely out.


In absence that, people get choice possible, whether field means choice ppe/testing vaccine. East/West divide? three times higher peak January [Leading Pfizer Scientist Vaccine Kids interview originally appeared WebMD August 6, 2021 (so yesterday), can't seem get video play site, linked one found work (from Medscape). 

He actually says October interview target filing said he's optimistic ""before end year actually Emergency Use Authorization"". 

I know enrolling children, I'm sure much follow-up data need kids. Obviously, Pfizer likely follow new enrollees full 2 years regular study participants. FDA specifically concerned incidence myocarditis, typically occurs days weeks vaccine. I'm hoping require 2 months follow-up data participants. we'll see.  health department barely job

So health department ~~barely~~ **not** job.

There, FTFY. üò¢ no, permanently everywhere. Latest surveys show 8 10 Germans willing get vaxxed.

The current low-ish figure Germany elsewhere due actual antivaxxers, people care enough bad right now, cases low, summer, can't bothered get vaccinated August, there's mandate whatever...basically ""uninterested"" get vaccinated suffer limitations. microbiologist buddy says rate transmission chickenpox still debate: R-nought 7, others 9 range. think i've read blog put high 10 though. Supposedly, Delta nearly infectious, 7 8 range, much transmissible mainline UK variant. Keep mind biostatistical artifacts. matters real-time case counts &amp; hospitalizations, affect public health decisions locale. end pandemic tho? disease still contagious still spread among vaccinated potentially mutate get around mRNA pathway. 

(Legit question) mass mandates likely come (if they're coming) fully FDA approved. read post all? That‚Äôs literally entirely post about. lol ""key"" people mostly do...health care, elderly, nursing homes, etc good start least.

hopefully year people get flu shot stick yearly, knows probably trying incentivize vaccines saying ‚Äúaren‚Äôt tired masks, go get vaxxed‚Äù. Turns people stopped wearing masks didn‚Äôt get vaxxed. Great success. right move mandate vaccines almost anything public.

I strongly disagree proposition less infringement rights make everyone mask, distance, deal capacity restrictions make people take shot makes arm sore day might give headache.

I want unvaccinated die. truthfully, willing‚Äîat point‚Äîto make sacrifices protect people making choice protect themselves, aren‚Äôt willing make sacrifices themselves. make bad person? think might! I‚Äôm exhausted I‚Äôm at. told remote learning good, better, person instruction. kids even thrived remote environment!

The ramifications lost years going felt decades come. Baaaahhhh üêë      Good hear, getting booster FDA/CDC recommends it. Unions one biggest forces pushing vaccine mandates right now, definitely them.  Get lost. See ya. let door hit butt way new McDonald's job unemployment office.  speaks volumes though don‚Äôt want human cattle miss work move shipments around get MD answer this. It‚Äôs ‚Äúmy arse‚Äù. licensed physician (at least USA) means use professional judgement prescribe approved medicines label. Plenty likely taking medicines label. (Beta blockers migraine many many examples) doses outside label. I‚Äôd like MD ideally pediatrician comment. Biden's popularity dropping like sack bricks, hey voted guy, point 30% country getting vaccinated, let get covid fast possible let's move on. Mandates completely pointless prolongs this. constitution say unconstitutional? Okay tons white people getting too. like we're forcing specifically. Mad? No. Disappointed people like exist? Yeah. it‚Äôs not.

Holding giving vaccine forcibly, threatening arrest unvaccinated people homes‚Ä¶ authoritarian.

Forbidding entering restaurant without vaccine, that‚Äôs policy.

It‚Äôs like saying store requires shoes shirt enter government authoritarianism. argument absolute bullshit. anything saying 95% hospitalized anywhere vaccinated definitely bullshit manipulation apply private companies, consternation Republicans want regulations lol recent video update website mentioned 98% people working living facility New York vaccinated. 2% might medical reasons get it, doubt they'd able pull religious exemption. know JW gotten vaccine, either legitimate medical reason, dumbass. matter think anymore. either jobless, ostracized, dead. vaccinated care annymore. reading account really smooth operation think today. think said probably took 6 7 years people board. actually believe trying sow discord?  That‚Äôs brilliant. places saying test weekly twice week‚Ä¶weekly isn‚Äôt enough Delta (avg 4 day incubation period), even twice weekly isn‚Äôt enough deterrent annoy antiVa actually getting vaxxed. rule harsh ensure either get vaxxed quit‚Ä¶win-win company either way, company likely privately funding health insurance plans. Hurrah! Glad help. recall correctly shingles recommended list vaccines 50 older.   nearly always old people and/or pre existing medical conditions.

If young healthy chances serious illness vanishingly low knew Matthew fucking Bethany. Remember, closing schools year noble thing going impact children, especially vulnerable children /s.

I‚Äôm already heading talk going virtual COVID-21 (Delta). Another lost year incredibly destructive must avoided costs. I'm confused prevalence breakthrough infections. fair say we're going get breakthrough infection unless we're totally isolating?  four seasons total landscaping Nonconsensual medical procedures generally frowned upon. guess could say Parole ""optional,"" end result defendant forced choose getting vaccinated going jail. think unfair choice give him, think going entrench people refuse get it. nonsense infuriates me. expected vitus calm many people got vaccinated, apparently worse ever?  How? 

How happening? unvaccinated people vaccination useless? Would fine many idiots refuse wear mask think vaccines magnetic chips them.  matter circumstances changed last month. looking pre-Delta numbers, little bearing people analyze risk now. That‚Äôs interesting interpretation discrimination vaccination choice. Discrimination relates things people don‚Äôt choice - age, race, ethnicity, orientation, etc‚Ä¶ somehow religion got looped protected classes whatevs it‚Äôs good shouldn‚Äôt care invisible thing people pray to.

It‚Äôs gonna sad day states there‚Äôs federal vaccine mandate. I‚Äôll popcorn ready üçø 2019 flu season 34,000 deaths total whole US. 616\*52 32k. florida's weekly total almost one full year flu deaths population 10 times big.

yet fully open, mandated masks, etc etc. bearing mind deaths take weeks work way reported case hospital death reported death

i wonder high death toll needs order make significant changes? ""Gay people get married like anyone else, someone opposite sex! equality!"" FYI, 85% effective serious illness means 6-7x likely avoid serious illness someone unvaccinated, else equal.

Multipliers better way communicating vaccine efficacy percentages. Percentages imply people get protection others don't. Multipliers correctly communicate people immunity boosting effect vaccines everyone, average, also fact vaccine provides absolute protection, increased protection. Percentages may lead vaccine hesitancy based incorrect understanding: ""Only 65% effective? I'll take chances virus!"" Multipliers correctly turn decision no-brainer: ""Triple natural protection virus? want that?"" I've gotten first UK may get second US. assume going cause problems ends happening way? mean that‚Äôs states for, right? Groups people elect officials run states way best represents wants/needs. That‚Äôs states different California/New York Mississippi/Texas/Florida. 

And science can‚Äôt tell us everything. people value right make stupid decisions even best scientific evidence, that‚Äôs freedom allowed exercise state supports it. It‚Äôs 9 months apparently misremembered something here, yeah...  media devastating varient ask me. Thank you, matters comes Delta. Organizations keep quoting high efficacy numbers using dates breakthrough Delta cases. say someone pro-vaccine wants conversation transparent. I‚Äôm vaccinated large outdoor events we‚Äôre already much safer pre Vax. Everyone know IRL basically back normal post Vac plans stay way.  Nope. Lockdowns crap. Mask mandate vaccines? Sure. Cool since like numbers want hide real data.
Go source % get long covid many get severe medical issues vaccines.
Go get numbers many lives saved, many long covid prevented.

Here simple clue help, peak vaccine, 300,000 infections 4,000 deaths day.  group seems generally ant ""THIS vax"" FDA approval long term studies like vaccines. millions taken mean issue road. Like said first comment many drugs got FDA approval pulled went general population problems. happens theres issue 2 years? much larger group open issues.


Except history vaccines side effects show within first two months.


And many drugs problems showing years later something that's one dose year?


The ones hear usually appear things people use daily


Yep, seems like antiVa BS actual concerns.   Gotta love champagne socialist teenagers reddit think government force businesses pay cashiers McDonald's 15/hr sudden business wants force people take shot attitude PRIVATE COMPANY THEY'RE FREE WANT STUPID FUCKING IDIOT PIECE SHIT MURDERER transmissible, yes. given adults vaccinated kids virtually never severely affected, there's one left protect. Transmission concern like last year.

Regarding variants, entire western world drop bucket compared billions people without access vaccines. Takes time could Trump never anything it. Biden appearing either. could enacted defense production act could kn/n 95 masks everyone. That's reasonable. Especially vaccinated. Peru Sinovac? must thinking Chile cuz got Pfizer Sinopharm Georgia. Sorry, I'm certain got scammed. COVID testings free. rest world.   I'd livid cop arrested me, put car, infected drove precinct.

You power control me? Get fucking vaccinated.   Sure personal experience 10% risk vaccination symptoms vs shrinking already small risk reinfection. I‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs brilliant decision, understand previously infected people forgoing vaccine People power literally said getting vaccine quickly bad thing. Suddenly Biden election changed mind. Tell Walmart always hiring.  Time DeSantis blame Biden DeSantis's mess. Mexico City closer Houston North Dakota put perspective far away transfer someone. Incredible. tip jar? States also allowed mandate vaccinations, penalty fine jail time. can't literally forcibly vaccinate you. 

I'm guessing federal government can't mandate vaccines except places federal jurisdiction (so, federal buildings, trains, airports, flights), may able pull funding states without mandates. That's got entire country minimum drinking age 21, IIRC. might thinking Christian Scientists. mom JW total hip replacement.   need fit right?  Thx knowledge stranger :)  I‚Äôve heard argument people believe they‚Äôll receive something different vaccine. vaccine isn‚Äôt safe, actually injected isn‚Äôt safe. person talking with, might want see Week Virology February [Paul good discussion vaccine developement safety concerns; 22:20-26:00 video talk six-week rule thumb long-term effects appearing.

Yeah, they're 20 cents. going bother pull mask might well pull one works ways. So, agree highly-transmissible pathogen loose solution take precautions?

Also, 'the data' shows precisely opposite proposing unless choose disregard factoring population density, type mask, application (wearing correctly), etc.

Let clear: overwhelming irrefutable evidence support claim properly-worn, appropriate mask (N94 above), absolutely greatly reduce and/or prevent transmissibility pathogens.

Now, one could argue 'the mandate require N+ masks even did, people wear properly' would correct claim. think failing policy multiple levels, trying practical.

My question this: Would rather protection protection all?

If someone shoot ping-pong balls high velocity me, could choose stand behind chain-link fence open. I'd choose fence every time. Sure, get through, least fence would block percentage :) Interesting many vaccinated adults can‚Äôt yet go back office, cram bunch unvaccinated unmasked kids schoolroom day. eligible child attending school vaccinated. Period. tell people normal completely unreasonable, we'll see dramatic drop compliance. people r annoying dumb fuck willing drag shit long physically possible making excuses. vaccines proven safe effective millions scientists world. vaccines already approved FDA. Emergency approval mean vaccines experimental. FDA knows vaccines safe already. hope actually get vaccine. better late never, would've even nicer gotten like 4 months ago. Oh see us without kids good community people like terrible waste hard earned money. Great. Still meaningless enacted.   Take Florida‚Äôs numbers grain salt. They‚Äôre intentionally hiding lot data they‚Äôre counting tourists vaccine numbers. Feeling like I'm going crazy. really memory reading past week can't find reference now. I've crossed original statement find thinking of. Who? I‚Äôm sorry. genuinely hope he‚Äôs ok. Ikr? I'm soo torn! want suffering suffering close home thing might wake up!!! horrible irony better (grown ups) mitigate suffering less see bad virus furthers ignorance wreckless behavior!! Grrrr I'm shocked. SHOCKED!

We'll maybe shocked. Nice. must mean don‚Äôt wear mask, fully vaccinated, right?   briefly wondered ""cloth/surgical masks vaccinated, N95s unvaccinated"" would work, realized stupidity idea. Looking like can't find source thought read on, hopefully I'm wrong. read, biggest challenge ain't buying jabs, rather exporting globally. Let us hope 12.9 billion doses donation reached countries need fast. Really outta start carrying tape recorder around ... OH YEEEEAH! fact gets brought every makes cackle bit.

This man became millionaire due disability law REPEALED soon elected office.

Mind you, times accident election YEARS, due legal wording put down, new people get sort financial compensation disability claims, day CONTINUES collect money state disability claim awarded youth. 

It‚Äôs literally breathtaking audacious people are. LOL Eric Feigl-Ding sourced referenced article credible source. see CDC statement vaccinated people spread delta readily unvaccinated? Oh yeah.

The first weeks back 5 month quarantine hiatus, multiple big burly manly men QUIT spot midway mandatory tests. 

Corporate went three vendors got group properly trained people (the first couple groups sadists despite poking brains gusto, super high incidence rate inconclusive tests). rolling everything smooth months, system changed us getting test kits going private little booths administered nasal swabs person watched guided us remotely via tablet.

It weird. drive-through weekly testing get nose swabs cars. Easy. 100%. admitted telling us covid airborne PPE shortage. also stated wanted higher vaccination rate meet July 70% goal dropped mask mandate vaccinated people. I'm saying using social engineering aka always giving us truth. sub collection wants best little rule follower gives kind ego stroke knowing they're """"""""right"""""""" thing  Hadith written accounts sayings teachings prophet. used better understand living example put teachings Quran practice. 


Scholarly interpretation Quran falls different category called Tafseer, sometimes uses strong Hadith evidence interpretations. Looks like getting vaccine perfect way go out!

 Sorry play wow night guys choice ü§£  like gun control. everyone forced look photos Sandy Hook we'd instant extreme gun control. 5 year olds torn apart high velocity rounds. Yeah mean I‚Äôve felt like shit quarantining three days first vacation year half it‚Äôs awesome Yes, people afraid disability death. 

Source: disabled.  mom lives brevard. Shit sounds frustrating. glad left state 10 years ago. would drive insane. Yes first vaccines need pass period testing approved emergency conditions done there's suppression side effects even deaths recorded result. It‚Äôs valid concern reason cautious children aren‚Äôt able vaccinated. hope, similar viruses we‚Äôve studied far indication, chance covid resulting long term disease low. luck won‚Äôt see similar chicken pox (shingles). think lot populace afraid wear masks take precautions forever, might overcompensating.

I agree, there's much convince otherwise. People like open changing people tired this, want get back normal. 

I understand many people feeling.

I think ""normal,"" time frame lot people want, realistic. think happen *try back normal* virus infect lot people, lot people get sick, worse. 

Our options are

- keep trying fight virus, even though sucks right now

- let virus spread whatever harm comes result

""Back normal"" option, matter tired are. (general, specifically) understand fact much better equipped deal life.   also giant instant disinformation machine starts ""F"". reports outbreaks yet?  don‚Äôt think many would agree assessment. Yes, delta certainly highly transmissible, vast majority demographic susceptible hospitalization death good protection that. perception lot hospitals caught guard rest us were, many closed covid wings restarted elective surgeries. Don‚Äôt get wrong, level death suffering horrifying, better place previously. point need turn focus away case numbers toward health outcomes. 79.3% fully vaccinated Dane County, Wisconsin dark red transmission map, hmm  It‚Äôs not. people without children paying education community don‚Äôt grow area full uneducated degenerates.

But since favor making requirements people using social services; start getting little strict people get welfare? requirements put place that? Nope, that‚Äôs messed up. thought testing, caution, vaccines would enough know. seeing panic posts city's subreddit concerning me.  Read style Holy Hand Grenade Antioch reason ask people say ‚ÄúOrthodox‚Äù typically mean ‚ÄúHaredi‚Äù ‚ÄúHasidic‚Äù, understanding ‚ÄúOrthodox‚Äù extremely large blanket term encompasses many, many groups often considered include Haredim Hasidim. large majority Orthodox Jews vaccinate enclaves don‚Äôt, don‚Äôt specific, extremely concerning reasons. However, people parrot ignorant, generalist ‚ÄúOrthodox Jews don‚Äôt vaccinate‚Äù line far, far damage good, alienate Orthodox Jews, vaccinate, never reaching Haredim Hasidim actually don‚Äôt. don‚Äôt classify people appearance

So let teach something. Different ‚Äústrains‚Äù Judaism different ‚Äúuniforms‚Äù speak. I‚Äôm saying able tell Chabadnik Satmar Sanzer. can‚Äôt tell someone ModOx (most ModOx guys know wear baseball cap instead kippah about, tuck tzitzit- probably wouldn‚Äôt able spot crowd) black hatted Hasid, again, probably get eyes checked. Different groups wear distinguishing clothing purposely distinguish themselves. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt classify people appearance‚Äù line nonsensical ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see color‚Äù. Yes do, pretending otherwise bullshit, honestly, it‚Äôs little offensive means you‚Äôre also choosing purposely ignore issues individual community deals with. excuse choosing harm others. 

And finally‚Ä¶ would speak issues know little proud ignorance? So, vaccinated. know ""do research"" means ""listen Sally Shithead facebook."" DeSantis official mascot *FloridaMan*. needs Duffman style costume press conferences. would interesting see comparison uptake 40s. would much better indicator countries good position. Thank hard work dedication. Sorry this. promise part know rest us Reddit best ! 3 batches going right now. 5-11, 2-4, 6mos-1. 5-11 expected September/October *said* 2-4 long that. 

But FDA asked expand trials, going take time. also non-zero chance delays (which probably be) I‚Äôm exactly holding breath September/October timeline. government actually leading way enforcing mandates contractors employees   federal government circumspect regards using exceedingly vast public health powers.

N95 KN95 respirators provide effective protection wearer others well fitted worn appropriately (no full beard). They're available little $0.20 bulk. even get designer colors prints like tie-dye, leopard camouflage. 

You still get vax also mask wear must indoors people live home high transmission area (where Americans are). everyone pays property taxes enjoys school America. fact great many kids parents renters live situations pay property tax land. makes ""Free"". free land owns non-land owners alike. issue faux outrage drama.

The government, group people way, already million laws regulate restrict liberty every direction.

But issue, one could save hundreds thousands lives, line can't crossed.

If want restructure entire society around chaotic liberty, argue vaccine. 

But first let's eliminate smoking bans allow drunk driving, anything else casually impact people.

That said, people want vaccine still trouble getting work 3 jobs, time off, can't afford 2 days side effects, etc. That's shitty retail service businesses need better. We're kappa variant now? It‚Äôs like he‚Äôs trying spread COVID without saying he‚Äôs spreading COVID  LOL downvoters. Gotta love reddit! Ah yes, finger pointing. productive. 

I‚Äôm liberal lives south. embraced trump someone finally wasn‚Äôt talking them. 

You‚Äôre exacerbating divide. Instead talking drink Miller hate Dallas cowboys, you‚Äôre making partisan. It‚Äôs Chinese finger trap politicians use keep us fighting rob us blind foreign wars wasted tax money. one people waiting yes ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Oh absolute irony hearing you. think anyone thread said ""Orthodox Judaism forbids it"". *I* certainly didn't.

But cannot deny large Orthodox Jewish communities vaccinating. Also, let's forget people gotten Covid once. Although rare, still happens. Yeah numbers come Israel's health ministry. Sounds like ascension me. Mid November way late opinion. religion thing hold showed paperwork shows received MMR, vaccines required work hospital grew JW (and since left). They‚Äôre encouraging everyone take ‚Äúwe‚Äôre supposed respect sanctity life, means making use available treatments.‚Äù  Man thought one people, got jabs decided allergy testing treatment. Well that's like million jabs. Granted, big needles, still dozens shots. still look forward blood draws, really mind shots anymore less likely get it, likely spread it

But part people unnecessarily glossing over. reduces risk getting it, reduces virus's overall ability spread. people vaccinated, would huge impact. Haha, well Alberta they're looking stop testing reporting numbers COMPLETELY end August. so... Ok death rate way lower ? reach since Sigma variant before. realize black Democrats largest population yet vaccinated (According cdc) fuck  Make Matthew 34:35 That's passively assisting most.

*Actively* assisting would something like spreading anti-vaccine lies. orthodox community

Which one? Yeshivish? ModOx? Haredi? Haredi Hasidic, stream? 

We‚Äôre monolith.  add police officer deaths 2020 on-the-job risks excluding like 105 deaths. COVID deaths? 92 officers died COVID. COVID deaths cause. 

I'll find link come back I'm justifying it. I'm predicting it. State intervention, state authoritarianism, definitely going make much worse, extremists referring to. Federal government mandate schools receive federal funding. really care 

Then here? effort clarify confused further. Grew Jehovah‚Äôs Witness (not one anymore.)

The medical treatment can‚Äôt take treatments made using human blood. So, vaccine used blood way induce immune response, couldn‚Äôt take that. doesn‚Äôt, they‚Äôre allowed take it. 

They actually encouraging everyone take it. logic is: ‚Äúwe‚Äôre supposed respect sanctity life, would mean making use available treatments protect life.‚Äù

Which actually good logic Christian standpoint imo, idk nobody else really said appeal people ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è People much accepting things make choice themselves. Telling someone can‚Äôt go restaurants sports matches in-person schools unless vaccinated still puts choice hands. 

Door-to-door vaccination US would start civil war. It‚Äôs better focus making lives unvaccinated people difficult able participate society, country approaches full vaccination closely possible. even young children vaccinated immunocompromised people get boosters, letting selfish people get sick die approach wide base public support. Show compassion selfish assholes threaten neighbors daily basis spreading lethal virus. concept...

No way. Give get it. city naming contest bus travels administers COVID vaccine, what‚Äôs good punny name it? infections UK [rising thought UK seen potential sign hope delta situation dire thought.

Maybe someone Israel could talk them.  pathetic point. Vacine mandate! Unfortunately Sisonke (the second ""trial"" SA) implementation trial J&amp;J essentially helped SA dropped AZ bad results Beta, phrased implementation trial without usual reporting probably study published journal. first trial, phase 3, believe additional reporting found 68% effective Beta Feb. get coming from, think consequences allowing healthcare providers get vaccinated far worse.

Sure, masking less likely spread virus patients, spread, albeit less likely, still possible. also put everyone else hospital risk unmasked staff areas. 

As healthcare providers, basic responsibility everything keep patients safe. getting vaccine point willfully reneging basic responsibility. also gives anti-vaxxers across society excuses propagate misinformation.

I also wonder patients right request healthcare providers vaccinated. imagine immunocompromised cancer patient, least expect providers.

And personally, I'm pretty sick tired selfishness anti-vaxxer providers. vaccine first came out, initial attitude often vaccine new, wanted tested others. words, wanted people like guinea pigs them. vaccine proven safe effective, still get it, rely people like provide herd immunity, jeopardizing health safety continuing potential vectors spread. COVID numbers hospital rising again, really feel like stab back people supposed work alongside reach common goal. horrendous pollution probably doesn‚Äôt help much either.  dumb, beyond fucking dumb. You‚Äôre supposed bomb people aren‚Äôt ‚Äúyour own‚Äù, US doesn‚Äôt problem that.

That‚Äôs thought meant that‚Äôs opposed. would gladly pay price bad flu week two evey year meant going back normal. Eh, beg differ. It‚Äôs 2 sided thing. Republicans tell they‚Äôre against, democrats lie tell they‚Äôre single payer. like force vote. disappointed ossoff warnock didn‚Äôt ‚Äúforce vote‚Äù like said would. 

Life long democrat here. get point. that's completely incorrect way frame got here, ""now turn put risk"" would make sense constant attempts get folks vaccinated entire time battled mask wearing reopening business oregon. Oregon ""shut down"" longer basically state US.
A threshold set ~70% vaccination reopen economy believed reasonable protection surge achieved (pre delta variant...anyway). everyone opportunity vaccination reasonable step re-open struggling businesses. furthest thing sadism governmental level. Immunity vaccination best solution right now, natural immunity infection path paved dead bodies blood, sweat, tears healthcare workers. get saying, that's much focus immunity vaccination. course I‚Äôm saying can‚Äôt vaccination Republicans drooling new voters 13 years Disease outcomes black white. It‚Äôs simply matter recovering vs dying.

So ~~health~~ death department ~~barely~~ ~~not~~ job. Yeah, indoctrination hard shake. people seem convincing, especially exposed to. worth, hope able conquer fears instilled you. 

As Dad, thank kind words. is, can't change past, hope learn maybe share lessons others. That's experience. see, that's cherry picking.

Unvaccinated people detrimentally harming rest society first place. can't talk cost so-called ""harm"" dissenting without first addressing harm exact people dishing first place. That's bad argument.  Depends narrative you‚Äôre attempting push. wanted push vaccine questionable would go mine, wanted push may work would go original. point. It‚Äôs unbiased headline hurts legitimacy article got shot US live Canada. wanted go register vaccine public health unit.

I called in, talked them, gave health card numbers, name, vaccine information, sent vaccine card.

SOMEHOW, despite information file, giving full name, along health card information, name vaccine slip dads name. Like, even get name?? come from? honestly surprised? someone moved America years ago, gulf reasonable unreasonable huge.  Nah, damn near everyone know got vaxxed started let guard fully vaxxed. Yes, making established technology. would whole lot credible also mandated people fed healthy foods places like McDonalds. bottom line people give shit.  Oh irony  sure, head could well become fixture every federal building 4 years.   run Greek alphabets, variants stop right ?

Hospitals filling covid patients huge ripple effect people getting treatments, cancer screenings, etc...so ideally, even care covid patients, society, still care.  Praise jebus. anti vax people saying wands use infect people want vaccine, want refuse testing well. Ugh. Yes, called mind business üòÇüòÇüòÇ. vaxxed happy... Go merry way. get fed others.. worry yourself!   mutations. decent size population cant get vaccine. us get protect ones cant. health department barely job Man...I cant imagine hard teacher right now. like coworker disappear one day. Five years world moved pandemic, except Australia still rolling lockdowns every time there‚Äôs single case. Funny thing quit broke, go new job place require Vax boat. bet think far ahead. many places mask mandates, get it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here's latest list: ‚ÄúA million people died 3 people didn‚Äôt die‚Äù

Moron. someone symptoms cold yes.

Being anti vax odds carrying virus skyrocket I'd prefer hang people middle going pandemic He‚Äôs protecting community. It‚Äôs community service. It‚Äôs misuse justice system all. clue could argue morally backwards.

In way vaccinated would pose threat inmates guards prison, vaccinated poses threat everyone interacts outside prison, community. Nah, latest data shows viral load high vaccinated unvaccinated delta. less likely get it, likely spread it. It‚Äôs looking like it‚Äôs ‚ÄúI get vaccinated wear mask you‚Äù Theres like &lt;6000 cases covid among 128 million vaccinated US.

Stop dummy 600 needless deaths many people don‚Äôt care. saying people vaccinated unempathic unvaxxed say people refused get vaxxed spread anti vaxx garbage watch loved ones die (even strangers) unempathic ones news vaccines specifically targeted delta virus ? Last heard Pfizer planning clinical trials August.  already know they‚Äôre gonna focus Type II diabetes fact 11 year old girl lost life wayyyy sooner would without infected. love meme-picture shows someone intubated says ""..and think Masks uncomfortable ?""

Someone thing vaccination-poke. compare many needles get stuck end Hospitalized/ICU. literally saw local story Kansas City yesterday guy watches 43 year old wife die bed suffocation COVID (of course kept putting hospital days) said, straight camera, still get vaccine. 

That's better poll data.   wish ""ignore"" feature Real Life could use people take stance. really arguing all. showing numbers accurate. said 120 million people vulnerable, really true. real number somewhere 80 90 million. Ah yes, listen doctors went school 6+ years epidemiology, pathology, virology, physicians. 

Or listen YouTube Facebook doctors? Theres soo much misinformation cant discern real.... huge /s wave peaks numbers start going again, talk safe exit strategy would acceptable.

Vaccine passports too! Yup. exactly libertarian method. Complete opposite authoritarian. Nobody said it‚Äôs over.  Nah, that's take one, one person close enough directly impact one people it. see biggest clear indication people lack empathy. 

This bit struggle people truly lack ability empathy really isnt choice them. like many mental issues. majority people either naturally learn understand appreciate develop. cant feel bad people people around them...but people never positions make decisions like lack ability reasonably. flood bold word unvaccinated absolutely drawn line sand.    Maybe would passive aggressive going store manager reporting them. really people wearing mask properly passive aggressive there's mask mandate, social distancing mandate store capacity limits 25% stated fire capacity forced people wait line outside someone walked store.

If someone wanted combative it, probably would returned same. since wanted passive aggressive wearing mask... give good get. military guns bombs. shouldn‚Äôt problem. think required tracked electronically. physical proof recorded backed up. Even without physical proof, got emails confirming gotten vaccines lost damaged card, still proof.  Jacksonville whole problem. 
I know &amp; meet many anti vaxxers daily 

I know guy job isn‚Äôt vaccinated get tested stopped wearing mask work allowed VACCINATED people stop. 
They get information tiktok &amp; Twitter run it. It‚Äôs highly annoying school hasn‚Äôt even started yet children becoming biggest victims. 
1 16 year old girl died last week COVID, it‚Äôs sad say many school year begins mask mandatory I‚Äôm curious feel stupid asking possible contract variants long you‚Äôre social distancing wearing mask washing hands? variants dangerous doesn‚Äôt even matter? be! would even confirm everyone indeed vaccinated? boils asking everyone got shot, everyone would say ""yes"" whether avoid group punishment. Without national registry, pointless. FDA paid Biden deep state cronies, course. Cdc already confirmed that's large possibility, lambda already somewhat resistant vaccines, months, likely going occur unless world vaccinated. would even confirm everyone indeed vaccinated? boils asking everyone got shot, everyone would say ""yes"" whether avoid group punishment. Without national registry, pointless. Bruh, Multnomah county 30th 36 counties new infections per capita. And, Portland surrounding counties also considerably smaller share COVID-positive hospitalizations fall ‚Äî previously claiming around half statewide total third.

I'm sure people catching brunch, feels weird focus like *the* problem  analysis McKinsey showed average kids 4 6 months behind Academic attainment, worse lower socioeconomic household. create downstream impact, potentially throughout entire K 12 journey. Lockdown skeptical sub like: ""Well guess gets dystopia flair!"" Maybe take play drug screening book workplace insurance companies require them. Hmmm interesting. antigen (triggered alpha) work beta? letters delta lambda?  Holy shit said this? He‚Äôs visited kids local hospital - let‚Äôs say toddler cancer. fucking ass. live Florida. virtual option available it‚Äôs offered child‚Äôs school. It‚Äôs county wide virtual option like separate online school. may want reach find there‚Äôs state virtual school available switch to. hope makes sense you. Yeah, people losing businesses shutdowns never able see elderly loved ones, shamed seeing loved ones, ‚Äúminor inconvenience‚Äù. Go play traffic. stepmom says community asking do. reply pray. correct response GET FUCKING VACCINATED FUCKING ASSHOLES!  ‚ÄòAs see fit‚Äô problem. It‚Äôs based real science, loudest people want. public health issue. Listen scientists/experts constituents likely don‚Äôt degree medicine public health. Nothing. He‚Äôs embarrassed grasping straws. US entered two week lockdown week ago. continue shamble complete lack competent leadership worried money lobbyists people's well being. That's nice, enforced? confirming person indeed un/vaccinated? far know, way knowing whether someone vaccinated voluntarily informing since there's national database. still based honor system, essentially pointless. exhausted traumatized. even know anymore half time. Insurance. Taxes. fiiiiiine. You‚Äôre either arguing bad faith, complete idiot, willfully malicious. bet three. 

For 16 months now, ignoring fact vaccination probably initially explained primary school, vaccination explained great detail scientists, articles, news, public service announcements, pinned posts sub Reddit, generally every area public consciousness. wanted informed would be, instead spreading fatal misinformation. 

A vaccination helps body build immunity virus, virus enters body gets attacked immediately, optimally affect health negatively spread, always people‚Äôs immune system overall health individual thing. 

The technology want, you‚Äôd skeptical of, sort force field murders virus range‚Ä¶

Nothing sort ever existed, exist wouldn‚Äôt vaccine. 

Anyway enjoy football field straw men moving goalposts, let‚Äôs hope don‚Äôt reap rewards misinformation campaign form losing someone care about, seems unlikely seems care yourself. Unless Abbott pushed even stupidity, bar mandates apply government entities contractors, essentially.  Private businesses still private businesses. think that, especially past, people vocal homeschooling people generally either evangelicals, cults, anti-intellectual. Within past 5-10 years though lot people well educated informed started homeschooling intention giving kids they'd get elsewhere, less. 


I personally know two families chose homeschool kids wanted taught accurate history control pacing things like math make sure kids really grasping concepts, they're excelling well adjusted. work parents kids isolated either. think common occurrence kid though  Yet 5 variants caused panic, changes public policy, racing run vaccine trials new variants changing vaccines hard-hit countries, doctors coming news flailing arms air then, etc.

The point is, meaningless statement keep repeating public Covid would still mutate fast *enough* fuck every prediction, model understanding virus every months thanks wide spread.

*And there‚Äôs five variants, many smaller ones got outcompeted. *happy Johnson Johnson noises* able sue damages still blanket immunity ? 

Won't take till sue  obviously long time ago, remember. definitely cough 2 months COVID. really, saw 1 switched virtual. others idea. Nothing indicate switched schools, counties, states.... forms fill out. nothing. I'm side world can't help thinking voted idiot. Americans different breed trust unmasked people vaccinated. I'm much likely think person wearing mask vaccinated since wearing mask display responsibility. can‚Äôt believe didn‚Äôt think better strategy. vaccine card hand filled sticker shot. Super easy forge. 

With different mobile technologies could created better better solution. Good. Sticking damn wand nose everyday sway lot minds. worst part interview statement lockdowns coming. hate say it, US instituted two week lockdown least week ago. wait til everything burns try fire. Considering driven almost entirely people un-vaccinated choice, think we‚Äôre going see restrictions un-vaxxed vs sanctions/restrictions whole.  Sure, unless get many vaccinated, would continue use NPIs *forever* keep transmission down. isn‚Äôt worth it‚Äîin view least‚Äîto fundamentally change society chance something like could happen. Maks short term aren‚Äôt terrible‚Äîand willing mask forever‚Äîbut true social distancing, don‚Äôt get interact person friends family awfully painful.


In addition, far vaccines holding really well, seems unlikely variant going send us way back square one‚Äîthe virus quite limited changes make become vaccine resistant. vaccine targets spike protein also latches onto cells. virus changes much, won‚Äôt able longer.

Plus, always update mRNA vaccines. quick easy do. main reason hope isn‚Äôt necesary boosters would divert resources poorer countries need vax do. source. Basic fucking mathematics. Ok wtf arguing against? you‚Äôre suggesting hospitals can‚Äôt over-ran; what‚Äôs point continuing encourage vaccines? whole purpose slowing spread; over-run hospitals.   Anytime seen person told judge willing get vaccine havent yet. 

I fine mandating vaccine everyone, fine schools businesses mandating vaccine, fine resturants, concerts etc requiring proof vaccination. supporter requiring one criminals get vaccine violation parole. 

I would love see every judge offer count dose equivalent 8 hours community service requiring community service part parole. think would great way encourage group (males 25-34 experience greatest number arrests) low vaccination numbers go get vaccinated. offering alternative seem fair...but losing faith fairness justice system. Left letters -istic another judge couple / months back offered lower community service sentences got vaccinated. remember details, would something like ""200 hours community service, 100 hours community service plus get vaccinated"". Judge said things served community, different ways. ‚ÄúApproved; 25 hours‚Äù r/byebyejob  Vaccine passports always table!  seems like vaccines block 95% breakthrough infections reading right even stopped 50% would much less alternative Probably RSV r number less 2 children typically catch children adults. Children tend get age two inability taught hygiene skills highly likely isolated ill.  work HR department processes exemptions, thought religious exemptions didn‚Äôt one file vaccinations, don‚Äôt get one COVID vaccine. moronic beliefs killing people.

Isn‚Äôt sad see news like this? 2 years in, still begging many what‚Äôs supposed done let us chance get sooner rather later yet, staying stubborn. dumb?

Get vaccines protect community. God damn it. want pandemic sooner rather later attitude. Yep, it‚Äôs shady places. clinics advertising $40 bucks billboards such. reason imagine paying needed test appointments rapid test. hear stuff Pfizer/AZ? It‚Äôs hard find numbers definitely would surprise used SinoVac vaccine. source Wikipedia cites claim SinoVac used  video reddit weekend man shot convenience store worker asked wait minute cash beer purchase. thinks going happen society every interaction going become argument? Classic causation vs correlation. unvaccinated significantly likely put risk, leading infections. need stop pampering dangerous unvaccinated idiots. test everyone, charge everyone test, offer people proof vaccination 100% test discount. deduct costs everyones paycheck. pay enough that's sure!  also work F500 company. require vaccines particular site county mandatory masking anyways, changes there. send regular site updates current covid cases - they‚Äôre usually several pages. 

I wish we‚Äôd require testing and/or vaccination. greatly appreciate do. Haha think like beginning video game points allocate either Magic strength. That‚Äôs funny. Ok, bye America. end whole hospitals don‚Äôt treat black people ‚Ä¶ *again.* Sums up: ‚ÄúWhy stay home I‚Äôm going get wife anyway? Might well enjoy fun!‚Äù evidence long covid affects children? Personally think 6 month testing period fine 2 months extremely short, fact, barely long enough see known side effect heart issues (specifically stated letter attached article take 6 weeks)  MJF right thinking within couple weeks Living Florida obviously see large number people refuse get vaccine, understand rest country looking Florida *not* do.

However would like point vaccination numbers right middle, terms percentage people vaccinated, either fully first dose. Many people wearing masks, general public taking precautions even state pretty much fully open entire time. exception weeks back early 2020. 

So yes, understand state laughing stock country. Especially DeSantis leading charge. understand half citizens right thing. I'm fully vaccinated, family. dropped mask getting fully vaccinated returned wearing one inside buildings. saying, paint *all* Florida brush. 23 states lower vaccination numbers, percentage residents. Goddamn that's fascinating thread. They're effective though. There's correlation mask mandates reducing spread COVID. Pastor here. I‚Äôve seen multiple pastors die COVID.

Yeah, indications lot fed active disinformation adversarial nations. according antis, vaccines created mutations Bubonic Plague killed 1/3 entire population Europe lasted long time.

It's certainly possible, unlikely. would fantastic. play way think though, given majority US adults vaccinated, vaccinated trend wealthier. think find short end stick I'm fine that.  Vaccine mandates predate FDA 70% blacks refuse get jab, defacto way bring back segregation except without pretense 'seperate equal' argument used failed, democrats racist history repeats people learn. responsible thing do. think gloom doom worse. saw article said ‚ÄúDeath Rate Surging 50 Percent!‚Äù 

When looked actual statistics, meant city question went 8 12 deaths reported locally. 

Going 8 deaths 12 deaths 50% increase.

It‚Äôs also scary way present info.  Really, would ever guessed non-vaccinated higher risk üôÑ Measles transmit among animal population. human virus human vaccines almost eradicate. going say impossible, eradication would take effort we've never seen before. situation might viable option.

It's definitely optimal doable. Oh rad, thanks :) saying government care ""rare"" people. fair set fire keep others warm. remind people test see react poorly not. guide vaccinated. studies long-term effects - would impossible point.

I know enforceable company shy litigate can't imagine playing fire like that. Packer fan, enjoy Vikings embarrassment... 

But time. Rivalry stops real world consequences. Hope hear better news future. Many countries well target so. I‚Äôm pretty sure you‚Äôre sarcastic, case you‚Äôre not, bar EUA US vaccines set really high. 

In words federal EUAs created equally,‚Äù Leichty wrote. ‚ÄúBecause widespread use COVID-19 vaccine, FDA informed manufacturers expected level endpoint efficacy data required full approval, enough safety data justify clear compelling evidence vaccine‚Äôs safety, confirmation technical procedures verification steps necessary support full approval.‚Äù

Fauci said he‚Äôd really surprised don‚Äôt get full approval too.

Approval basically foregone conclusion. you‚Äôre fence, I‚Äôd highly recommend getting vaccinated Delta takes area still emerging places like Israel UK. Studies posted government CANNOT go door door needles mandating everyone get jab.

They go door-to-door fine get vaccinated. I'm suggesting rights individual respect liberty may times, pressure great dangers, subjected restraint, enforced reasonable regulations, safety general public may demand."" nearly enough running. know plenty never get it. stick line developed fast. find data support vaccinated people getting covid hospitalized. Hmm, getting People pledging strains like sorority ‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúDelta Lambda Kappa!!‚Äù time distributed got everyone take it, would date within months. need social distancing policies(not full shit downs) global vaccination strategies place years fully get safety back control.  Lets come back comment northeast cali going thru waves winter? like looked case chart per region see seasonality covid last 18 months really no. Doctors know specialize in. proctologist insight covid virologist. might even less me. primary care physician uses sources (honest) journalist does. 

The question natural immunity vs. immunity vaccine interesting one. One best scientists world still working on. thread great info.  Ain't seen ONE yet. Tonight wet club concert. first concert I've since pandemic started. fully vaccinated Pfizer. wore mask entire concert. people venue wearing masks. 

I realize risk. uneasy going I'm little worried now. think worry? nevada begin get hit? There‚Äôs pretty big difference walking trail sitting beach going music festival 20k+ people standing shoulder shoulder screaming singing along music.   doofus still business? Mask Vaccination? Yeah - going news again. Laying icu bed going beep beep beep. even need high dose. 3, 1/4 doses week apart.

The danger allergic response.

It bears repeating... parent decide children cannot wear mask, case 12+ decide deny vaccine died, parents decide vaccine administered children.

It needs argued like this.  idea people happy catch coronavirus try protect coronavirus pure insanity

Well people going catch coronavirus various forms multiple times lifetime natural infection not, might well give immune system headstart vaccine.

Agreed.

The main reason think important us aware natural immunity thing natural immunity going play big role helping get cases upcoming weeks/months. *shouldn't* play big role, since people turning vaccine, will. variant contagious delta, ton people going get infected going increase number immune(ish)--and dead--people, thereby reducing spread. agree you.

I think food, virus dries (like apple cereal box), nice smear mucus, virons air someone breathing nearby, enough live virus makes inside infect?

Otherwise, food hot gets cooked, dies.

The stream wet cold, would preserve virus think. Like China blamed contaminated frozen goods outbreaks country.

What I'm still sure well virus bind ACE-2 receptors digestive tract. ton gut (and think also diarrhea symptom), I'm less sure mouth esophagus. transmitted equally efficiently mucous membranes, affinity lungs, common way get viron ACE-2 receptor breathing in?

I especially curious Delta, people shedding wayyyy virus before. need start washing apples wiping yogurt containers alcohol? brother refused get work said ""once FDA approved, required get it."" got first shot day. general, people shouldn‚Äôt terrified. Yes, particular campus still around 50/50 fully vaxxed vaxxed all. shut within two weeks school last fall don‚Äôt faith it‚Äôll go well. really curious % unvaccinated people natural antibodies is....I feel like unvaxxed must insanely high %...if next week....  I'll take *Things Make Sense Say Internet* thousand, Alex  choose wear one, though fully vaccinated, want minimize risk family. daughter quite sick, even shaves percentage points possibilities spreading family worth me. mom supposed retire last year 65 spending entire career hospital nurse bedside. stayed finally put retirement notice end month. exhausted, overworked, underpaid. Plus hospital kept floating COVID unit meant spent past year half terrified going catch never recover due age health issues. 

She feels guilty retiring due staffing shortage, couldn‚Äôt happier. Thanks, release J&amp;J touted 100% hospitalization death. never illusion vaccine 100% getting sick even severe disease.

I understand viruses mutate real world performance different trial performance. still think it‚Äôs okay alarmed drop 29% drop efficacy specifically hospitalizations. Um fine people also refuse wear seat belts wear glasses take tylenol get headache? would absolutely wear KF94 better mask indoor event area ‚Äúhigh‚Äù spread. Isn‚Äôt CDC guidance? [Arizona‚Äôs data 11% cases breakthrough cases. 

Obviously much better vaccinated terms avoiding infection avoiding serious illness. would call 1/10 cases ‚Äúrare‚Äù event, would absolutely take protective measures. Great name too! odds (when vaccinated) similar flu risks already accepted.

I agree Leana Wen WaPo earlier week.

If vaccinated, goal necessarily need risk elimination. risk/reward analysis based activities care about, risks risks around you.

For instance, *love* restaurants. indoor dining 16 months. However, point, me, worth risk sit inside restaurant every weeks. (Truthfully, I'd *prefer* patio dining, places care going offer that). 

If unvaccinated child, risk/reward calculation would different.

It's complicated now, that's OK. That‚Äôs diagnosed. There‚Äôs lot people without insurance going doctor idea people happy catch coronavirus try protect coronavirus pure insanity

Most people going catch coronavirus various forms multiple times lifetime natural infection not, might well give immune system headstart vaccine. Yep. boasting false acceptance. can't empathize another's perspective, including changed perspective death's door. kid, bad &amp; took long time get rid of. earliest memories breathing treatments nebulizer machine room. idea that‚Äôs real medicine quack shit considering way mother eventually ‚Äúcured it‚Äù chiropractor. consider RSV possible reason breathing kinda fucked adult

pretty sure it‚Äôs basically harmless adults hit hard kid That's 70% adults. UK 89% adults 70% population.  knew FDA approval end trials, impression typical vaccine phase 3 time period covid vaccine going end 2023. saying already wrapped phase 3 trials? You‚Äôre supposed stop ovulating would still get ‚Äúevidence ovulation‚Äù according gyno. ovulation pain discharge. I‚Äôve taken every day time interruptions all. Nothing wd weeks PMS symptoms. They're shuffling feet intentionally all, FDA nimble enough deal fast changing pandemic ways, great example. They're working agenda set March. Well, one thought March cases would surge among children new variant right school start. 

I'm 100% sure they're working asses best can. question. institution inherently limited procedure ways clearly harmful need make quick decision, even incredibly obvious one. guarantee they're internally frustrated well.

If covid novel viruses indeed going something we're dealing rest lives, maybe need separate emergency pandemic vaccine drug administration handle decisions allowing FDA keep hands ""clean"" (untrue) perception they're rushing things breaking rules. maybe pandemic time reforms could help FDA situations. 

But whatever answer is, something gotta change. simply design FDA deal rapidly evolving situations like this. seems data saying I‚Äôm surprised ""but vaccines FDA approval back February! therefore still safe!!"" Yes, number breakthrough infections broken vaccine type.

If people received J&amp;J get breakthrough infections rate people receive mRNA vaccines, great.

If people received J&amp;J account breakthrough infections, that's pretty terrible news anybody received J&amp;J vaccine, it? tots pears! hate patriotic means said. totally agree, damn it‚Äôs sad. also needs required planes, trains automobiles. Might well require boats too. People still choose get vaccinated. end pandemic.  Yeah, messaging someone recently asked specifically, said ""North Korea,"" like, ""Haha what?"" whatever, basically explained boss requiring employees vaccinated, comparing living North Korea.

It like, right, yeah, working job boss wants get vaccine protect others deadly virus, free quit, *totally* like living world's cloistered totalitarian regime, literally try shoot spot trying escape across heavily guarded border. Whatever location gave shots record it. go get another copy. Wholeheartedly agree. 

Businesses contract whole thing way use ADP payroll temp agencies lobby staff janitorial companies facilities management.

Also, vaccinated required work place, know Bob works place, make pretty good guess whether he's vaccinated without seeing private medical files.

This whole HIPAA argument thing dumb. Ugh. Good luck. call multiple people health department provide proof insurance company received vaccine booster since state doesn‚Äôt require adult vaccinations entered database. nightmare. still choice. company right protect employees. employees right decide whether want meet company's standards employment. like it? Work elsewhere. That's choice.  aren‚Äôt many corrupt doctors. Plenty arrogant doctors asshole doctors. Even burned jaded doctors. there, don‚Äôt enough power and/or energy corrupt. Looking forward That's gross misrepresentation law.

Nobody gets religious exception put others risk. Period, full stop. Who? 

Cares 25% keep suffering long covid recovering School going add entire new dimension surge. hope works family. Hear, hear!  county voted keep masks optional schools students ( staff believe). sure data honestly regardless answer opinions wouldn‚Äôt change natural immunity requires put health risk virus vaccine not. vaccine less effective &amp; fails, you‚Äôd get natural immunity (the option) anyway, still always get vaccine.

(your question good one &amp; i‚Äôm curious answer don‚Äôt want people seeing without thinking &amp; using rationalize vaccine hesitancy) announcement came taking care patient. shocked realize surgeon ones room vaccinated. looked awkwardly circulating nurse scrub techs ranted it.   Fuck Greg Abbott would expect people get vaccinated people want wear mask. people fine masks fine vaccines? Also I'm sure someone mandate vaccine they'd handle cases people legitimate medical reason able get. Haha, that‚Äôs true good point. also get covid today die blood clot tomorrow. that‚Äôs point trying make. Covid cause pneumonia people die covid. There‚Äôs link found yet vaccines deaths, covid. Can‚Äôt wait first airline this, get business. 

It‚Äôs tough big carriers, many fly lot places vaccines still readily available. thought Houston healthcare like really really good. Guess getting worse. I'm surprised New cases exponentially rising, hospitals reaching capacity, school start, vaccine available. Stupid America full display unfortunately collateral damage, hopefully tragedy contained stupid much possible. going say thought Jehovah's Witnesses took pretty pro-vax stance days I'm curious perception neighbor. people Louisiana believe really happening? simply care? continue believe vaccines dangerous virus? Love it. Although they‚Äôll definitely spell ‚ÄúHIPPA.‚Äù Thanks! vaccine perfect. reduces likelyhood catching like 90ish percent, still get give someone love unvaccinated. go rave makeout 40 people get covid feel fine grandma 5 year old cousin dies, still bad. Yes. anger husband feel rampant spread misinformation gone roof mother (who refused get vaccinated) fully sedated 100% oxygen ventilator, doctor telling us Tuesday he'll ""encouraged"" lives see next Tuesday. rhetoric reversal conservative talking heads little late. lies spread, especially official news networks via show hosts guests, considered criminal. Everyone mother's household workplace vaccinated fine, not, hospital. risk-benefit ratio quite unfavorable time. Children overwhelmingly mild Covid cases, vaccines new used technology widely deployed humans (both mRNA adenoviral vaccines). much better understanding safety profile vaccines. Delta raised risk Covid children. 

Even now, there's uncertainty risk myocarditis children. FDA recently asked Pfizer Moderna increase number children involved trials. wandered internet hangout medical professionals somewhat surprised see universal support FDA's apparent decision increase enrollment trials increase follow-up time. comfortable extra scrutiny given experience COVID's impact children. parent two kids current vaccination ages made breath little easier. dad take vaccine FDA approved.

He also got back hospital seizure. *Caused non-FDA approved herbal medicine he's self medicating with.* Going indoor event tomorrow that‚Äôs likely fairly crowded. I‚Äôm fully vaccinated, I‚Äôm little uncertain wear mask not. I‚Äôm thinking it‚Äôs fine don‚Äôt, (obviously masks required I‚Äôll wear one) I‚Äôm wondering vaccinated people doing. guys think it‚Äôs ok go unmasked you‚Äôre vaxxed? keep hearing mixed things I‚Äôm sure. approved, emergency use (which definitely applies here). existing policy place standard emergency approval. Standard approval specific time limits place. instead changing whole process, use emergency approval followed standard approval.

It follows pretty common trend medicine science. guidelines apply 99% situations, freedom stray benefits outweigh risks. feel you. have/had needle phobia i‚Äôve mostly sort gotten exposure but....hoo boy fear powerful thing. much worse actual shot.  Amish near get vaccinated except tetanus injury. refusing Covid vax ""the proof eyes"" Covid bad. Sure died really bad flu killed folks days God's will.

They opposed masks, fight rule constantly. NY rule unvaxxed wear masks ignore rarely get pushback it. Also stay home sick, awesome bus, small shop, anywhere really I‚Äôm vaccinated, terrified? concern specific campus life? kind stupid here. 

No one forcing anyone here... quit. Easy peasy lemon squeezy.  mom hospitalized last year covid completely denied whole thingwas covid. hard core anti vaxx too. Fingers crossed reality catch her. Correct wrong read somewhere really played big role getting rid smallpox mandatory vaccination everywhere everything. eventually beyond US get good global control virus. (Pretty sure countries already mandating vaccine sure many). Well hope don‚Äôt plan take hospital bed reason then. Idiots. Damn! welcome news. mean, 500,000 person study? That's one got 67% 71% numbers from.

  
e.g.: ""The vaccine efficacy 95 percent death Delta variant, 71 percent hospitalization, researchers reported."" 33% pretty low wrong vaccinate directly responsible death child. choosing vaccinate now, would acknowledge that.

So course doubt they'd choose vaccinate now. least, publicly. Yeah, trying paint daughters bed room tonight ‚Äúgood arm‚Äù. effects pale comparison horrible anxiety leading vaccination. like‚Ä¶damn. wasn‚Äôt bad. mind worst enemy sometimes.  That's thing, doctors telling people wait. doctor told (off record) sympathizes dont want take (off record) advised giving 16 year old nephew.  Anyone worth seeing probably will. looks like 1.2-1.3 somewhat sustained period, pretty high. 

Keep mind straight line one constant growth, week 1.2ish numbers 20% growth day (100 120 144 etc). small dress shop near me. sign saying ""All staff vaccinated. Pleaso enter without mask proof vaccination"" Admire heck small business. Mandate. National mandate next step. take deaths, loss economy get there. Fingers crossed infected.

Since started new job, WFH, right got second dose, I've focused since maybe late May, early June really start going more, wearing mask less. feels like taking two steps back step forward.

Hope Fall better, hard say, especially Texas there's still way many people refusing get vaccine. Maybe one day, look like happening anytime soon. seen previous statements infection equivalent single jab Moderna/Pfizer far fighting future infections (and recommended getting second one). think basic logic safe vaccine far better option dangerous disease. me, question along lines whether natural immunity provide similar benefits already known infections (not ex ante analysis path take). words, combination vaccination natural immunity path towards everyone immunized? remission right one cure. Eventually it'll come back, they'll knock back start over. looking forward though, bone marrow biopsy painful thing I've ever experienced. really feel bad kids go leukemia lymphoma. felt like hips crushed whole time hematologist apologizing knew painful too.

Still growing COVID ponytail, eventually pandemic breaks I'll get cut donated Locks Love. best way think memorialize passed virus. Every hair-inch life extinguished.

Thanks article, think started entering public discourse somewhat first started hearing childhood obesity huge problem, can't recall ever mentioned diabetes 2 time. imagine parents actually dealing knew heck lot did. Stupid people cannot possibly make better decisions brains won‚Äôt allow so. Hoping suffer exclusively truly messed totally lacking empathy. Unvaccinated people victims. Yes, year. want mess participation Moderna trial. agree you, also believe current vaccines eventual burn tragically unvaccinated control group, hospitalization death remain main focus. worrying studies hints covid leads longer term brain damage even called low risk individuals. I, one, would like information understanding around would comfortable letting guard completely whatever ""normal"" might become. 11 year old type 2 diabetes that‚Äôs parents, ridiculous(unless there‚Äôs weird medical thing don‚Äôt knowledge of, let‚Äôs real, Arkansas). Obviously vaccination front.

I look forward 5/3 year old get vaccinated :/. Yes. like pretty much every vaccine.  family wants last Xmas want vaccinated. 

Do Christmas ahead schedule, time exists sort potential exposures. Well apparently allowed tell truth CIA created Taliban Reddit honestly awful I‚Äôve ever felt adult life. get shot every year? ty! im saying nothing article states natural immunity provides protection vaccine. someone risk vaccine dont ALL. Guessing went Sturgis 2020? thought lifting mask mandate, openly encouraging large gatherings one month general population availability vaccine US definitely fishy idea May. 

Now, feeling instead people gradually willing go back outside, it‚Äôs gonna drive sizable portion population hunker till least next Spring.

Next Spring things likely calm again, hope CDC handles things better. say protection hospitalization death means need booster miss point severely. society-wide level, preventing spread important. Health care workers (the population studied here) spend lots time close vulnerable people, they're personally safe fully capable spreading virus patients that's really good enough. expect hospitals regardless FDA Approval would mandated get vaccine.   Already stoked Channel 5‚Äôs report it. Andrew absolutely killed last year‚Äôs edition. Couldn‚Äôt virus become deadlier? couldn‚Äôt vaccines adapted needed?

Background 
Statins up-regulate angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, receptor severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), also exhibiting pleiotropic antiviral, antithrombotic, anti-inflammatory properties. Uncertainties exist effect course SARS-CoV-2 infection. sought systematically review literature perform meta-analysis examine association prior statin use outcomes patients coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). 
 
Methods 
We searched Ovid Medline, Web Science, Scopus, preprint server medRxiv inception December 2020. assessed quality eligible studies Newcastle-Ottawa quality scale. pooled adjusted relative risk (aRRs) association prior statin use outcomes patients COVID-19 using DerSimonian-Laird random-effects model assessed heterogeneity using I2 index. 
 
Results 
Overall, 19 (16 cohorts 3 case-control) studies eligible, total 395 513 patients. Sixteen 19 studies low moderate risk bias. Among 109 080 patients enrolled 13 separate studies, prior statin use associated lower risk mortality (pooled aRR, 0.65 \[95% confidence interval {CI}, .56‚Äì.77\], I2 = 84.1%) reduced risk severe COVID-19 also observed 48 110 patients enrolled 9 studies (pooled aRR, 0.73 \[95% CI, .57‚Äì.94\], I2 = 82.8%), evidence publication bias. 
 
Conclusions 
Cumulative evidence suggests prior statin use associated lower risks mortality severe disease patients COVID-19. data support continued use statins medications patients indication lipid-lowering therapy COVID-19 pandemic.

Herd immunity threshold comes reproductive factor virus, efficacy vaccine. former high enough latter low enough, herd immunity becomes impossible. don‚Äôt think know enough yet conclude anything definitive bars also? Misinformation. spread rampantly comment sections. healthily skeptical comments, even one. Universal daycare would amazing. guaranteed time work complete period contagiousness COVID-19 RSV dangerous infectious agents without fear employer repercussion. 

Interestingly RSV increasingly slide identified cause morbidity mortality older adults. One many articles:  friend claims fully vaccinated claims anti-vaccine. However, husband refuses vaccinated (which obviously friend's fault), refusing vaccinate children (only one currently eligible). friend said waiting ""more data"" vaccinating kids, moved goal posts, saying there's full FDA approval, she'll vaccinate kids, turned there's full FDA approval, she'll ""reconsider,"" telling concerned ""communism"" vaccine mandates comfortable pushing vaccine children, even fully approved. 

In meantime, younger child, asthma severe allergies, respiratory infection necessitated urgent care trip. said tested negative coronavirus he's getting better (not sure RSV what), sent video dog, background, could hear poor son coughing room. weeks since first told sick, poor kid still coughing substantially.  
She claims idea son could gotten sick go anywhere (she count church) do, sons (not husband) always masked. 

I feel children unloaded anxiety pandemic onto afraid, yet let vaccinated (but yet got vaccinated). son got sick he's supposedly wearing masks really around kids. homeschooled last year plans send school year. Good luck that, Brenda. Northwoods good example favor.  Anyone actually see article? give Murdoch money, archive shit bed one. new talking point vaccines causing mutations slowing keeping people getting sooner burn crazy shit. Again, spouting falsehoods. evidence vaccinated people expediting mutation. isn‚Äôt bacteria aren‚Äôt antibiotics. delta variant started India immunized. people scared degree 54 % Americans say worst ahead us? think it‚Äôd better people accurate understanding state pandemic. impression problem COVID lethality? We're Virginia 4yo 2 yo, Covid already. Still gonna get vaccinated, would great information. :-/ work health system (non clinical) situation bad spring things gotten much worse, going call non-clinical staff assist. yeah, healthcare disaster possible. Scary. give person credit, models wrong almost entire time. cases dropped April, none like 100 official models projected cases drop fast. It‚Äôs hard trust anyone anything attempts make prediction. Safe fun tripping something?  Fair point goal posts go ""flattening curve"" ""No transmission""? masks definitely work did?

I say someone staying home work events lockdowns, wearing mask even said useful said may even harmful, got vaccinated day considered eligible. taken seriously since start, maintain skepticism criticism evolving narrative Additionally, viral load breakthrough cases drops much quicker unvaccinated cases. Total load time still dramatically reduced lower R0 values. Combined said lower case incidence, still useful vaccines. i'm hotspot. doses. i'd probably royally messed otherwise. sympathy gone. going one heck show. Wow, that's crazy. Somebody write article something it. guess always thought ""practical"" people, retrospect seem mesh lot beliefs sort image media guess. agree points, nothing worthless comment. mistaleningly believe person anti-vax went rant it. anti-vax.

I idea what's going think humans institutions fallible? Guess pseudo-intellectual cause realized humans imperfect. problem someone else die something Covid ICU bed left needed it.  one cares. waste. Depending age, lot good summers left had. either young old enjoy it, cuts like half them. rest, either busy, poor, occupied kids, unhealthy more. 

And important note summers getting hotter hotter less enjoyable already puts gradual deadline future summers

MoRon I'm seeing direct quote expert. guess, think meant restrictions could put place next 15 years, literally whole period next 15 years.

Questionable translation haha does, weakest protection vaccine gives. dependent initial antibodies get first response vaccine shot.

So matters long ago since got vaccine well. I'm pretty sure many breakthroughs medical staff old, would types got vaccine earliest. Tattoos shots two different fears. Tattoos feel like someone grazing skin dull knife. isn‚Äôt bad problem tattoos.

I think pretty easy lay examples religion, religions, also provide good world.

The real problem extremists that's universally true across board. Religion, politics, name it. goal eliminate extremism. fair observation, true fact justification? criteria used least understand reasoning. would much appreciate anyone knows documentation discussing aspects policy testing though see myself. Catholics generally pretty well adjusted normal people, least ones I‚Äôve met are. obviously nutty ones like groups, overall they‚Äôre really part problem. Yup. wife feels guilty nursing second surge. don't, list reasons exhaustively long. They're also really busy scapegoating illegal immigrants. cronies disgusting. vaccinated people, infected, spread much unvaccinated person, alone much risk.

I glad see people beginning think this. 

Until now, idea vaccines would sterilizing. is, vaccinated people would spread virus. Now, starting see true Delta variant. (Eric Feigl-Ding reported study showing viral loads identical vaccinated unvaccinated people first six days Delta variant infection, vaccinated person's load drops quickly.) 

This turning lot conventional wisdom head. example, allowing vaccinated people travel, vaccine passports allowing vaccinated people congregate, on.

Unfortunately, seems take public health agencies society general several months catch going on. Watch get excused comorbidity. already forget prove vaccinated laundry list diseases went elementary, middle, high school/college? antivaxers think vaccine personal choice cus me, community. ‚Äúvaccine-evading-variant‚Äù, would antibodies people vaccine still help combat viral infection possibly lessen severity ? I'm that. workplaces schools need mandating vaccines. bring cases prevent surges get people vaccinated. England similar position long ago uplifted restrictions people getting vaccinated.   state 18 need consent parent/guardian. I've heard states allowed without, that's hopeful sort language doesn‚Äôt effect like hope. point England even pursuing vaccine kids 16 danger Covid ages doesn‚Äôt justify risk. seen several medical professionals question ethics even testing vaccine young children fatality rate low. think interesting people happened catch vaccines available. natural immunity offers better protection, get vaccine?

That said infected back January got vaccine soon available me. Hopefully combination gives extra boost immunity? Sounds like music fests I've followed. Ubbi Dubbi happened TX way back April. set app regustering vaccine test status. often app never actually checked fest easily foreseeable things like lack cell signals due crowd sizes.

We weeks away 50 million kids returning school amidst huge delta surge, time way less protections last year. 

People underestimating delta ignoring 50 million vectors disease breathing 7 hours day.  Abstract 
Background 
Melatonin known anti-inflammatory agent immune modulator may address progressive pathophysiology coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).Aim study. evaluate clinical efficacy adjuvant, use melatonin patients COVID-19. 
 
Methods 
This single-center, double-blind, randomized clinical trial included 74 hospitalized patients confirmed mild moderate COVID-19 Baqiyatallah Hospital Tehran, Iran, April 25, 2020‚ÄìJune 5, 2020. Patients randomly assigned 1:1 ratio receive standard care standard care plus melatonin dose 3 mg three times daily 14 d. Clinical characteristics, laboratory, radiological findings assessed compared two study groups baseline post-intervention. Safety clinical outcomes followed four weeks. 
 
Results 
A total 24 patients intervention group 20 patients control group completed treatment. Compared control group, clinical symptoms cough, dyspnea, fatigue, well level CRP pulmonary involvement intervention group significantly improved (p &lt;0.05). mean time hospital discharge patients return baseline health significantly shorter intervention group compared control group (p &lt;0.05). deaths adverse events observed groups. 
 
Conclusions 
Adjuvant use melatonin potential improve clinical symptoms COVID-19 patients contribute faster return patients baseline health.

Seems two thousands similar instances. course many want others bringing obvious comorbidities.   entirely, everyone could vaccinated was, wouldn‚Äôt needed. would still spread Delta, wouldn‚Äôt catastrophic, wouldn‚Äôt even remotely result healthcare system overwhelmed.

Masks social distancing still necessary people aren‚Äôt getting vaccinated. 

I‚Äôve stayed masked entire time, people won‚Äôt mask ‚Äúmuh liberties‚Äù ridiculous, doesn‚Äôt mean vaccinated people can‚Äôt angry masks necessary people.

Exactly. Guardian want quarantine? looked highway fires, ignored missed important part. Yes, 345 deaths, also 1,300 injuries. Meanwhile, every single person gets infection Covid gets, sense, injured. even among young, injuries life-altering. we're talking millions injuries hundreds thousands that're life-altering (long covid), virtually would've made less severe vaccine. calculation motivates people get flu shot: Here's safe vaccine dramatically lowers chance pointless suffering possibly serious illness. take it?

If COVID, get vaccinated!

If already it, get vaccinated want to. alternative given prove tested antibodies T-cells. Cloth masking works source control, minor form protection best, really want wearing one within 6 feet someone infectious. N95s, KN95s, P100s, Elastomerics best bet. Elastomerics clearly overkill people, mostly extreme protection intubating COVID patients. live Malta, another 80% vaccinated country. Vaccination works allow vaccinated people ""herd"". 

We little test (involuntarily). look COVID cases chart. see first 3 waves, line declines nearly 0 end June thanks combination vaccinations picking up, soft lockdown, summer masks mandatory everywhere including outside.

June, local restrictions removed mass tourism yet. Local vaccination rate around 70% cases stayed reliably single digits long ""herd"" outsiders coming in.

July 1st opened tourism: vaccinated tourists certificate unvaccinated negative PCR tests. Cases shot roof, instantly. look chart opened it. line went straight 0 200+ (dark red risk) couple weeks.

The authorities decided would allow vaccinated tourists, unvaccinated negative PCR tests. Cases started going third last peak, restrictions allowing vaccinated people. even ask PCR tests, could well come carrying virus.

Vaccinated herd + unvaccinated ""negative"" tourists trouble. 

Vaccinated herd + vaccinated tourists may may carry virus = okay.

All information readily available internet, much Maltese press/health communication English.

We know cases. article posted said 2% seroprevalence study, that's (thankfully) sustained human-to-human transmission. almost pandemic never quite got ground.

Maybe MERS. Everyone know convinced already covid. probably right. data then? people scare shit me, I‚Äôm vaccinated.  kids 12 cannot rely herd immunity. 

Kids rely herd immunity, reached yet. Why? people refuse get vaccinated! minimum standard herd immunity least 70% *full vaccinations* nowhere near that! So, no, kids can't rely herd immunity standard met.

Instead getting mad vaccinated people, point frustrations towards standing way child's future. **precisely** every epidemiologist worth penny going **8 months ago** (and longer): *very* predictable devastation intersection highly-vaccinated population (travelers) *still spread virus* handily moving less-vaccinated one (locals).

Notably concern American tourists would spread COVID *abroad* visited cash-starved countries, unable afford vaccinate citizens desperate tourism. 

Now instead worrying developing world, we're worrying Hawaii.

Because **none** epidemiologists said ""hey, vaccinate like maybe half us we'll good go."" good summer? American forgive I'm wrong Roe V Wade based right medical privacy? Stop making imaginary enemies act happens context many people actually specific group talking about.

Are facts? I‚Äôm truly split matter. one hand think people need pull heads ass get vaccinated around reeks massive government overstep. I'm super glad tons studies long haul covid children. Well tickets two concerts, state fair, two plane tickets. plan keep good summer. I‚Äôm vaccinated risk low. someone isn‚Äôt could that‚Äôs problem. peer-reviewed evidence?  efficacy vaccine preventing symptomatic infections lower E (1 - 1/Rt) , means even 100% vaccine uptake impossible attain true herd immunity (i.e. disease dies naturally even one wears masks takes precautions). 

That means preventing 80/90 % deaths able manage infection rate spikes better high vaccination rates, problem won‚Äôt disappear short term. 

My 2 cents! Voting either major political party voting well-being make moral question ""science"" issue? complete misuse term science.

Science extremely storied history wielded blatantly racist ends.

I think that's case vaccine, Science (with capital S) still is, many, many instances, tool oppression people world.  Pedantry selective reasoning goes long way reinforcing one's views, shown.. go: willing engage genuine meaningful way, I'll cease side engagement. 

I wish best luck good health. It‚Äôs awful bureaucracy do. client joined military birthday incorrect enlistment papers. reported state federal agencies. 10 years later, still couldn‚Äôt get changed match birth certificate. (It typo changed October 25 October 28, something like that.)

I hope get fixed quickly! one 500 Americans coming South Dakota? intersting, deadly virus... Oh agree hesitancy. 

I think information now, despite lot know sure yet, there's one conclusion arrive at.

Even takes people hesitancy.  chose skip shot that‚Äôs them, you. pushes extremely strong opinion fact.

No. never ethical lawful force people things bodies. Period. End story. government that. Whether abortion vaccines. Whether used good purposes ones sound all.

People get vaccinated absolutely forced governments to.

Bodily autonomy line government cross people accept crossed. debatable. Human rights debatable. almost like experts telling truth FDA approval isnt enough convince me. I'm exhausted well. really believe draconian states don‚Äôt let conservatives run schools systems ground, intelligence level populace suffers said gonna hide? gonna avoid large crowds counties low vax rates. too. support unvaccinated rights stay isolation among don‚Äôt infringe vaccinated rights stay alive. 

If unvaxxed want mingle, respect rights well mask, distance frequent testing.  go Wal-Mart today (only place town Coinstar), packed. Since cases started going up, resumed wearing mask indoors. 

I noticed that, often, ones *not* wearing masks Wal-Mart ones like 4 5 kids. Many unmasked kids coughing sneezing stuff. Delta seems making kids sicker original Covid strain. School starts three weeks mask mandates school district, suspect require masks.

Much America learned nothing Covid still feels invincible.   understand less infectious Delta, means may become wide-spread. time tell.

Also noted one instance sufficiently prove variant deadly. Several nurses care home infected, mild symptoms. Yeah I‚Äôve read that, something I‚Äôve looking while. mean quantifiable benefit that‚Äôs reported, assumed benefits may make significant difference real world exposures/infections. true benefit, easy gather data reinfection cases delta tearing across US states smart lol people said wouldn‚Äôt get vaccinated cause wasn‚Äôt fda approved going move goal posts say rushed fda part conspiracy get everyone vaccinated Replied wrong comment. 

That‚Äôs true I‚Äôm trying hypothesize someone may hesitant. California entered conversation.  realize could mutate quickly.  Wow. think I‚Äôm person thinking this? address point instead replying useless senseless garbage. Thank thoughtful reassuring comment. I, admittedly, often pessimistic tend fear worst. I‚Äôm also jaded working healthcare almost thirty years.

I hope you‚Äôre right. Thank you,  don‚Äôt think Covid Vaccine completely reliable tremendously effective, 

It's one - - effective vaccines ever invented preventing death potentially deadly disease. sure. Make stats. ""Long Covid"" seems pretty anecdotal point. think good studies proper methodologies forthcoming (Johns Hopkins one) I'm aware conclusive evidence phenomenon anything bit hysteria propounded hypochondriacs. sounds reasonable, thanks.

I'll keep eye see gets updated information Delta emerges. I've tested three times. first time lie, thought wand scraping brain back skull. last two times fine, barely invasive. Anyone complaining tests wuss. üòâ already established nobody coming homes check vaccination status. mandates purely ""you cannot enter business Govt. office without proof vaccination"", ""you cannot enroll college without proof vaccination"", ""you cannot continue employment without proof vaccination."" 

So clear implication is, people en masse going load up, drive offices, campuses places employment, shoot bunch people.  Maybe made reckless policy trying incentivize getting shot?

What exactly Policy based truth manipulation.

I'm saying think CDC's guidance based best information time. got new information, changed guidance. want? mentioned several times r/nursing Yeah‚Ä¶.? agree? I‚Äôm comfortable taking something FDA approved. it‚Äôs approved it‚Äôs good. What‚Äôs point exactly? Idiots accept consequences actions pretend dealing consequences forced something. 

Don't want vaccine? Fine. get live little life little home participate society. choice, like choices presented.  First off, seatbelt laws closer Mask mandates vaccine mandates. Putting something *on* inherently different putting something *in* you.

Second, *have* get car. want never drive around, never affected seatbelt law.  vaccine mandate would apply entire population, way opt-out. true vaccine FDA approved? Genuine question. going like 1840s again, cholera breaking out, people arguing right open sewers plumbing want. government overreach impose expensive sanitation standards. They'd probably call open sewers ""freedom sewers"" ask people wanted government dictating live lives. 386k potential infected people traveled back home across US least. still 1 person infects 3 more? Lets say even 86k caught something 300k not...yikes.  heard CDC power forcibly inject people past smallpox. Whether exercise power different story. Excuse writing novel precisely explaining effects COVID-19, limitations knowledge. vaccinated, really suck get COVID-19. always watch movie TBS 10 years. saw media interviews understand they're stupid.

Another guy said he's never getting vaccine, he's literally coughing camera.  Interesting.

You absolutely right would able distinguish pick either crowd. something feel shame in, would unless trying classify someone?

Again, taking way personally. Let's honest, needs kill kids people wake take seriously. 

I'm way advocating nightmare scenario, pointing easy conservatives say well elderly weak know that's risk life big deal, vs something hollows family bottom up. shit would cause riots.   Yeah vaccine still greatly protects serious illness hospitalization. True, don‚Äôt know long immunity lasts yet, also doesn‚Äôt demonstrate virus outrunning vaccine all. yet another worry viral load carry others asymptomatic.  where‚Äôs proof? said moral issue  people get Covid you? bomb people. thing hill might literally die Every school, university preschool requires proof certain vaccinations. well entering many African/S American nations one must present Yellow Fever certification.

TBH - don‚Äôt think Covid Vaccine completely reliable tremendously effective, currently it‚Äôs have, it. Let‚Äôs go lives.

Yep. something would fully expect Trump fail and, even low expectations Biden, hoped would‚Äôve stepped on. seems like eager declare victory vaccines left measures would help us get there.  also authoritarian

All things true  making assumptions me. agree use masks RSV outbreaks! mandating vaccine.

If that, masks might still necessary short period, probably full semester.

Masks stopgap, solution.

Edit: clear, know allowed FL, be. It‚Äôs probably simple. Maybe it‚Äôs required there. would brain surgeon know anything pulmonary issues immunology? point look getting vaccinated pfizer vaccine getting J&amp;J 4 months ago? DeSantis‚Äô head kind see like driving car (or daily activities). everything logical reasonable lower risk ""be prepared"".. that's much do. all. sound like toddler saying ""mooom, started it!"", tbh.

Keep do. don‚Äôt know get idea phase 3 trials average three years. Many phase 3 drug trials I‚Äôve involved lasted six months, FDA guidance Covid vaccines said would require six months data BLA (it two months EUA). Phase 3 trials powered enough subjects demonstrate safety efficacy, last however long FDA requires particular disease investigational product. doesn‚Äôt mean sponsor stops collecting data though, often data continues collected years original study subjects product marketed. Phase 4 trials considered start marketing approval, giving real world efficacy safety information product widespread use rather controlled clinical trial. Anyone claims vaccine still experimental long term followup phase 3 trial still ongoing twisting meaning words fit agenda. 

Not sure going this. distinctions splitting regulatory hairs don‚Äôt real importance. additional efficacy safety data needed FDA approval. None. It‚Äôs matter FDA reviewing hundreds thousands pages clinical trial documents, manufacturing reports, etc. Pfizer completed submiting May Moderna weeks later.   figured would believe approach, im still vaccine id's want go store something cause think thats stupid fullly fda approved business require employment makes sense im huge fan vaccine mandates something approved emergency use.    death outcome guys care about? never wanna get sick ever, regardless risk death. course vaccines work, vaccinated also spread virus. problem argument quite typical, versus us mentality underlying reason pandemic got bad.
