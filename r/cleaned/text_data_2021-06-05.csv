0,2021-06-05," Huntington pretty liberal 16,500 average daily paywall me. found vaccine mostly saline. 

Well, part true. need tiny bit active ingredient diluted saline measure doses syringe big enough handle. Lol I'm living Florida fear. I'm vaccined up.. living life Saint Augustine mask free well. hard imagine maybe another outbreak happen? Good luck. Hope good health insurance.  Correct. Plus bottom 5 vaccinations. Masks social distancing non existent weird downvoted heavily, make valid point. workplace used test twice week. we're month... literally took back press conference gave declared emergency powers would last virus eradicated basically means never. Biden xenophobe know that. Sorry, try again. Um Australia like 20% first vaccination dose...  even Trump come said Covid big deal day one supported restrictions know STILL conspiracy nutjobs US would've said completely fake made restrictions part government plan control us.

That number would dramatically smaller, though. would FOX personalities making fun people, hailing heroes. OAN NewsMax may still it. would way smaller. would changed lot. Nah Lol man I’m living life mask free Florida loving it. Continue live life fear! Nah Feels like 10 years ago lol. Every week felt longer one it. recently anyway. Really? Ok. mutates use protein? we're fucked testing masking? say like kind big inconvenience... Grow up.  Also bonus, get mass shooting every week. Well... shit!? Like magic went away. Wow that's crazy, we're 70% first dose BC, Canada, roll-out pretty botched begin with. guess smaller population helps. better metric watch would hospitalization testing guidance changed fun taking yearly boosters like flu fight variants lol!   Travel much hassle worth testing requirement over. Vaccinations enough.  refuses blame authoritarian leadership that’s connected pretty much every country poor performance Second hand smoke choice ppl make. comment every death tragic ppl die every day example. going end like state emergency declared Roosevelt March 9, 1933 lifted 1978. See Report Special Committee Termination National Emergency.  Well, like said, begin designate permanent conditions certain point. think we've reached point. 366 kids dead this. really matter common sense, unfortunately short supply. Children humans. Humans catch disease. Children fully vaccinated. Removing mask mandate kids vaccinated good idea. Also, common sense would lead realize disease permanently damage body. ten percent people recovered experiencing lingering symptoms.  National review liars. type data publish? Says guy felt feelings reply enough post publicly.  Florida government lives alternate reality   Biden Trump xenophobes. You....take things little literally, tad seriously. Relax. joke. wet market market open space...   Well, problem Florida.  Desantis   Thank POTUS Joe!  vote could 97% like ratio like real life   First all, OP simply asked question, get high horse, basic logic bullshit outta here. 2nd, ""fricking news"", OP ED. author also simply asking questions hypothesizing. Dont dick try pass smart. one amongst many article written variants. global CDC messaging resurgence adolescent hospitalizations deaths new specific variant, still heading right direction U.S. need additional fear. Newsom sucks alternatives worse I’m fine staying, recall isn’t even going happen. Nobody gives fuck here.  Spot on. ran red crayons  required us swap General right.  sane blew mind?? Finally... saying declaring state emergency bearing whether governor tyrant, logical thats truth  aren’t called tyrants states don’t 41 counties still less 50% capacity indoor dining, counties still can’t bars open, gyms operating 10%. 

Small business owners employees don’t need worry things Florida Texas like California one lowest positivity rates nation nearly 23 million people 58% people least one shot.  name burger n out, voted best fast food chain world  Christchurch Mosque shooting, Amazon fire, Hong Kong protests, name things antibody/natural immunity nice though.  Wonder tests that? send vaccines person would get even though immunity countries people need them. One could predicted numbers, roughly, know vote

Even nearby liberal Austin still 50% fully vaccinated. Iowa gave way now. Florida isn’t leading time. wear mask around unvaccinated people. always feel like saying type jinx effect, allow continue saying it. Oh come on. made obvious beginning Covid likely make sick you’re 45, we’re trouble getting younger people vaccinated!  Vaccinated mask: go get em! 

Thank sacrificing keep family rest us safe, data U.S. quite good right now, especially you’re vaccinated. It’s probably time start putting life back together...at pace. Wear mask go don’t feel better that. Variants may yet become problem vaccinated people, shouldn’t live that’s already case. concerned possibly spreading virus others, perhaps wear mask busier, crowded, enclosed spaces. Outside well spaced areas like parks risky. hope take grandmother nice park outdoor venue. Wear mask like, take feel confident. something widely available (in country) would prevent happening would work training immune system recognize fight virus recognizing it. 

If only... actual source data pediatric hospitalizations Illinois make assertions please share it. 

There likely still enough cases much less P.1 cases children see many hospitalizations yet anyway. mean can't change, likely to.  Woah weird… I’ve experiencing longer cycles didn’t realize started got second vaccine dose. thought strange happening, didn’t even think could’ve vaccine. Hoping goes away; second dose March. curve fell last year around two weeks. promised would stay way, unless listened president. Bingo.  I'm stuck US reason visit home country despite vaccinated. dumb. Really? say that?  Can’t wait see Europeans try spin “America bad”… like always do. nonchalant attitude pandemic wrong? post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:
  
[Vaccine FAQ Part FAQ Part appointment bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Nah, look vaccination graphs states, pretty clearly heading towards 70% herd immunity level. estimate state July extrapolating graph. case restrictions need put back place emergency, able move resources emergency.  restrictions due end 15th still due end. Well labeled FFP2 factory. would people know not? It’s compulsory wear masks German public transit, supermarkets etc. Cloth masks surgical masks really use days unless wear environments it’s required wear masks all. created vaccines, distributed them, administered them. pandemic team wasn’t scrapped, put different department. sure link posted best prove review, looked nearly 130,000 medics, found two shots Sinovac vaccine 94% effective preventing COVID-19 symptoms, 96% effective hospitalization, 98% effective preventing death

But irrelevant, highlighting stupidity comment, probable reason got downvoted, thread America donating vaccines Taiwan, Chinese vaccines got anything. Checked times Alabama pleasantly surprised.  Well majority population already realized that. greed elite much big care poor people lives needs work starve travel Miami vacation  [this appears medical masks (surgical masks KN95 FFP2) would compulsory transit. there's world difference filtration surgical mask KN95/FFP2. Injecting drugs enemy nation people brilliant idea. Pfft, I'm waiting Louis Vuitton ones! live low rate area UK almost 80 per cent adults 1 vaccine 57 per cent 2. Currently zero daily deaths low positive tests. However far away number areas Delta varient. spread faster numbers climbing, latest reports deaths effected much although hospitalizations tending younger people require less serious intervention get better. really good news low numbers people 2 vaccines contracting new varient.

Unfortunately means Delta varient state like Fl parts US low vaccine rates could easily devastated.

These states need start pushing vaccines. Also worldwide need start shipping vaccines poorer countries ASAP can't afford worse varients keep coming along. So, quick question. Two months ago got cansino shot due work.

Now, two jobs second work got deal government got J&amp;J vaccine entire staff. told already took jab adamant take one sure.

Is safe? it? Uk mostly using AZ though, RNAs vaccines 30% doses administered; I’m wondering role they’re starting see third wave. big problem critical thinking, evidenced poster you’re responding many comments thread. lot “magical thinking”, claiming stuff like “everyone social distancing wearing masks 100% wouldn’t made difference!” much hassle get test? Last time took one, took 15 minutes total (6 minutes walk there, 3 minutes take test, 6 minutes walk back home) result within 24 hours. 

I guess every place testing convenient this, would think many people would consider mild inconvenience test worth travel. Thanks!  provide testing numbers anywhere? Indians really learn stop using lakh crore outside India typing English.


I say ""tysięcy"" typing English make sense all.  I'm really sorry, can't imagine hard is. May ask country? create anonymized data 10mins tops automatic going forward. intention hide data completely. Honestly; listened experts instead taking personal attack would easy win.  agents consent required

Forced vaccinations? CDC start getting ready then. unprepared share responsibility bad was. Mixed messaging moving goalposts destroyed credibility. became clear early idea handle it. Everything reopening slowly. August, delta variant fucking everything up, quasi normal.  Likely Astra Zeneca/Oxford vaccine yet cleared USA emergency use, yet millions doses purchased. unfortunately know cities function  seems comment contains 1 links hard tap mobile users. 
I extend they're easier sausage fingers click!


[Here link number 1 - Previous text ^PM ^[\/u\/eganwall](http://reddit.com/user/eganwall) ^with ^issues ^or ^feedback! ^| ^| see 50% quoted US media, without also quoting administered front line medical workers anywhere, vaccines test. done normal population, par AZ, sinopharm, JJ etc.

This dangerous mention creates additional obstacles vaccination effort.  Even one vaccine provides better protection another, protection worse vaccine lowest efficacy still works. Sorry, forgot mention victims chinese social media campaigns. 
Well... source you... maybe get rid brain wash: Brazil Chile suggested Sinovac shot 50% 
 effective preventing symptomatic infection, far cry  
90%-plus rates achieved Pfizer nothing we’re talking about. talking deaths. I’m talking immunocompromised children entire quality life effected. also chronically ill children whose life made dramatically worse catching covid meant stuck ventilator almost bridging can’t seem get past step. don’t work pediatric rehab don’t see doesn’t mean problems aren’t there. Japan using brands haven’t cleared AZ use yet due blood clotting concerns, decided let sit (hey thanks) young think effective young people dont worry people lot distrust towards vaccines general az bad press regarding We’re clearing EUA Pfizer J&amp;J next week guess include least one those. FYI

Rule No. 2 sub:

No edited titles yess way go FL!! data confirms less effective Pfizer. 50% said sufficient control pandemic. please post source this? Everyone thread thinks numbers FL look great skewing numbers like that, people need informed. I'm not, people can't move whim, especially vulnerable likely wheelchair access local support systems etc. kids literally lowest risk group insanely low chance going harmful covid-related shit

whats next, going ban automobiles certain # car accidents happen every yr? Gucci worry buddy! totally normal! immunity response starts place vaccine injected, i.e. shoulder.

The immunity response brings inflammation, affects tissues that's shoulder mobility reduced!

You move arm bit help blood flow, help you! Might wanna check numbers again. Japan vaccinating 100k day average May, 700k day. rate Australia Japan going right finish approximately time. can't upvote hard enough American media prefers downplay Chinese, regardless good bad do. I'm defending human rights record per se, seeing Sinovac vaccine making strides Brazil even Philippines, seems like COVID coming controlled. francophile trying plan honeymoon August, exciting! anyone know kinds things open France days? good trip things still mostly locked down, guess. you. kids aren’t vaccinated don’t know kids compromised immune systems doesn’t mean it’s problem. They’re everywhere people know attitude aren’t directly effected knowing someone suffering pandemic. mean early CDC said masks weren’t effective. don’t know say correct response written decade ago. Relative US countries better response, that’s pretty low bar compare determine response good not. Overall response around world poor best. 

Additionally, according website, 600k deaths US. I’m sure source 1 million deaths, claim seems unnecessarily exaggerated unfounded. Meanwhile single thread Colombia Argentina, countries recently really deadly waves.

Outbreaks Latin countries Argentina's outbreak look pretty insane show little sign plateauing. wonder Latin people come describe situation there.  Apparently it’s data. omitting covid deaths caused one thing (ei pneumonia) even though covid fucks organs causes pneumonia —- expect rise pneumonia cases peak time next year “surprisingly low covid numbers” Nah, crux whole show politics. Vaccine efficiency secondary. literally *JUST* tested positive. tested negative yesterday second test today positive result. he's going affected, going take least days starts show symptoms. one gives profit... mixture AZ Pfizer/Moderna, think. AZ normal people officials ones pay  enough end hospital effect people's care well... Fucksakes. That's tacky. dumbest, nonsensical thing I’ve read today. They've got Tiger blood even close, significant outbreaks due vaccine refusal. heard immunity numbers yet. getting close it’s still little ways off. Shit, even vaccinated people could still get it. Thought Canada people vaccinated USA. Send Mexico. fine. different vaccines vary comes preventing infection transmission, *all* (at least, ones approved emergency use) effective preventing serious complication death. imagination 51 yo high risk friend get vaccine. 3 waiting lists. 33 year old friend gotten contact persons pregnant person lives another city.

I even going try get vaccinated priority groups done. disaster.

And agree, it’s total BS regards restrictions. Spain example would never dream restricting people based vaccination status. Either restaurants open not. Etc Lol thats literally every single country. Simple get excess deaths compared pre covid get rather clear cummulative picture least deaths point view! happened ""Delta"" nomenclature ? country (Austria) last November schools... first detailed statistics school, suddenly cummulated numbers even cohort data mixed age groups schools. end even get info anymore case surveillance class. Info usually becomes less accessible incentive hide (number cases political agenda, like wanting enforce reopenings) know, crazy right!? That’s also untrue. doesn’t match KN95/N95 specs, that’s still better normal masks/cloth masks/no masks. 
Unless he’s giving masks claiming N95, giving away free next best option. Ok, rephrase it. Maybe dont remember do.


First goverment bodies advising wear masks leave mask health profesionals.
They also advising boil eggs properly eating meat.
I find poster it. wont hide excess deaths...

Good luck that, given Delta variant stil hit US (just look UK atm sheesh among highest vaccinated worldwide) can't sure accuracy case numbers, sure hospitalisation death numbers way accurate either? submission automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Age-wise vaccination priority 20-60 year olds first, older people, could afford stay home/in nursing care longer. would fair compensation forced stay home year half. 

And 60+ year olds offered AZ, refuse, sent back list get vaccinated BioNtech everyone else upto 18 year olds vaccinated. Meanwhile government Hungary, home country Katalin Karikó others worked vaccine: ""Fuck noise, we're going support Sputnik-V Sinopharm instead corruption good."" Add that, many older people refusing AZ vaccinations young currently expect reasonably early first shot accept AZ. It’s crazy. basis one comment Reddit, no. maybe media downplayed efficacy Sinovac?  Say something stupid blame downvotes chinese trolls, whatever makes feel better.   Can't trust anything China boast internationally lol take covid test every single activity would like already seriously restricting options. take self-test front employees before
- getting haircut
- eating favorite restaurant
- playing football club

And things wanted yesterday. restrictive?

You also ignoring emotional aspect things. I've sitting home since March 2020 60+year olds lives saved. okay peoples lives matter. 

But get vaccinated first get go live lives again, still subject restriction? multiple conversations frustrated young people said (joking otherwise) perhaps gotten covid could enjoy life Also, far everyone vaccinated wants it. currently 45 percent WHOLE population (including 18) vaccinated, meaning 60 % adults received first shot.

Yeah tell city Hamburg, they've said wont drop priority June 7 GPs telling Group 4 people come back August first shot. far, federal government keeps opening vaccine younger younger people means kids tiny cities (literally smallest risk group) getting vaccinated 40 year olds Hamburg. Germany's vaccine rollout disgrace. Hamburg's continues disgrace Finally, restricting rights vaccinated cured unconstitutional, little choice here.

By logic restrict freedoms vaccinated public health reasons able restrict rights vaccinated people. Human psychology considered laws made. soon, young people say - 'Well worst case, get covid, that's bad it? recover whatever want next 6 months'. that's get next wave. guys states still getting significant numbers declaring victory? many people unwilling vaccinate? Man guys still getting decent number cases LOT people seem want get vaccine areas. Texas getting 1300 cases day 29mill population Canada getting 1672 today 37.59 mill population. 

45% Texas one dose vaccine. Canada 60% entire population... Canada still taking decently serious. 

Why sub basically declaring victory already? delta variant seems WAY less success stopped 1 vaccine.  US probably best place vaccines purchased. aren’t many countries manufacturing logistics capability has, means vaccines people quicker. many, many people true - estimates lower hundreds thousands low millions - immunocompromised, blood diseases cancers, conditions make vaccine ineffective, even take it.

The way people safe everyone society takes vaccine get disease circulation - herd immunity. Japan procured enough doses vaccinate population least twice. Priorities opinion given major outbreaks means purchase vaccines own. likely however doses given political allies counter China. never said it’s mot thing. said live place ppl want get vaccinated, get vaccinated due medical issues, try move different place. community likely get another wave. (Children 12) Suffer massive outbreak? Hasn’t happened since whole thing started don’t know would imply would soon.  difference us would go homeless risk financial ruin get friend back. Im sorry dire straits real solutions get back feet. none get friend back way protect others like him. September Pfizer targeting results. Approval would likely October/November  mean news organizations media broadcasting idea leak Wuhan conspiracy theory. hard conversation, one. declaring ""there solutions"" without actually explaining achieve them, telling us care ask proof.

Thanks, family fully vaxxed indeed big relief. set feels wonderful. Forgive particularly dense, Japan extremely slow vaccinating people, sharing much needed vaccines?  rest states population doesn’t bend overly cautious least vulnerable impacted demographic. need stop reading articles written Indian media houses Indians. Imagine New York Times using lakhs communicate US audience. statement ridiculous. want read global content? grow brains, shut up.  That’s he’s saying all, Trump’s fuckups pretty evident. Article indicates airline.  grocery store usually within one's city town, therefore absurd comparison discussion people banned *traveling* abroad specifically see family. hard conversation? asked solutions listed see. Looks like something hard give up. Got it. Good luck yours. Glad set 

I checked America's death toll since 1/2 million mark. I'm glad country sharing vaccines stockpiled, kinda wish higher percentage participation someone middle stem cell transplant immune system. 

The next best thing could share nations need hope prevent mutations.  currently already vaccines using, there’s imperative give emergency authorization. it’s probably going go regular FDA approval much longer process great. One things Trump liked favorable Taiwan many ways, US decades now. wrong. But, India destitute country cannot produce vaccines own, country would deserve vaccines since India produce even buy some. said, time give virus lurk around, chances getting mutated India needs vaccinated take responsibility ourselves, much. callous, means 318 million people USA situation. become issue ""the greater good"" (please feel free leave 'Hot Fuzz' references below). agree person above, need best overwhelming majority people country... get things back normal. Nobody says they're traveling grocery store think 18 deaths year. Though know age group looking at. 16 M, getting pfizer vaccine get second dose, either get 19 days 44 days (the range normally 21-42). due country vaccinated time first second dose. Preferably, would wanna get second dose 19 days later vaccination center allows it, safe so. Assuming vaccination center allows it, better get second dose 19 44 days second dose. Either little little over. Thanks help    Got it, idea going assume we're assholes saying hard. Calm down, John Cena! Books pretending inform people instead telling harmed harm families … ""Kain asked ""Am brother's keeper?"" recall isn’t happening? thought going vote fall. people weak immune systems, vaccine may even protect them, heck people already died even tho vaccinated probably result mentioned. There's much political meaning medical &amp; charlity. think U.S. government show something Taiwanese &amp; ccp government. Want know difference us is?

I feel sympathy fact lost best friend, I'm sorry terrible unfair. 

You clearly give single shit $20k difference homeless could you? can't see non-covid consequences this..

At point, simply can't afford hemorrhage money...I've done part, I'm vaccinated, wear masks I'm around people aren't, ask us financially ruin people smaller percentage can't get vaccinated realistic, sympathetic... looked information find specifics. happen know aspects vaccines 11 planning discuss? Pfizer results review? materials found indicate might budget defining parameters meeting rather going potential expanding younger kids. excited possibility able expand sooner end 2021. Waiting see soon done.

Edit add: solid info meeting could find. Unfortunately, lots Taiwanese ppl hesitant get vaccinated AZ. one reason low vaccination rate. vaccine hesitancy also explains Japan giving Taiwan. sharing! need share more! States emergencies expand government power. Expanding government power indefinitely “just case” end authoritarian governments. surprising coming California. Novavax isnt first protein subunit vaccine rolled though. administered emergency authorisation awhile Delta variant going pose real problem you’re advocating people wear masks hide indoors areas 60% vaccination rate essentially cases don’t know else tell completely unreasonable. It’s going happen. Well, Taiwan country needing vaccines. looking numbers current situation luckily even grave, would understand affected poorer countries like India would ""get mad"" US Japan prioritizing donations allies first. haven’t heard unanimous denial western leak, haven’t researched much possibility. assume it’s Wuhan lab’s location proximity first cases, sickened workers confirmation about. don’t think western nations much, any, internal access lab time, either.  Anybody know what’s new rise cases UK? know they’re highly vaccinated country surprised see taking again. Absolute essay say might variants Sure, travel budget £20 won’t take much increase costs 20-40% regardless 😂 

Point testing becoming cheaper accessible, general. live walk appointment get free (PCR antigen) results 15 minutes one hour. usually way airport Yea sounds like power grab. surprised.  hear saying, India huge population. Preventing future covid outbreaks involve preventing mutation much possible.

So sucks government handled well all, still want see large world populations vaccinated ASAP. Particularly ones handling covid well. 51yo risk friend got basically laughed GP. based recommendations Reddit told contact doctors, like gynaecologists etc. also told chance. Vaccine Center everything booked next weeks.

The government telling truth real world situation. Basically unless run bot script get appointment 1 refreshing websites chance moment. It’s joke system orangised. countries much better job. sounds like lot, doable. left job large national company upper level manager/director consistently receiving 800-1000 emails day normal day, well 1000 bad day.

Outlook filters lot work you. high levels, many distribution lists people use CYA really need read. directly read responded maybe 300 day, mostly bullshit meetings. Corporate email etiquette grossly underappreciated skill. depends many included FYI, many junk, many require action/response.. FYI / junk I'd imagine ton.. set outlook rules sort basically read needed folders time COVID classroom, majority children room sick. requirement get tested child tests positive, claim ""allergies""and one kid who's parents take fall guy. 

Parents want kid testing positive can't go work themselves. Ignorance bliss.

I'm state top things too, counting accurately, imagine majority states handling it. never know true transmission kids want find it. Even Faucis leaked emails Trumps fault hahahah. Gold man well done Compared nearly 300 million could get vaccine kids approved? I’m quoting Spahn said. Lots friends 20s vaccinated one way other. reason pessimistic. Mid- end July completely reasonable. Im convinced people won’t able ever go back normal. SIL family continue post stuff Facebook “you can’t go back normal getting vaccinated because.... (insert reasons).” It’s honestly sad point. think main reason young unvaccinated kids suspect even kids vaccinated entirely new reason cease enjoying living life. I’d like hope nations leading doctor heading pandemic would capable sifting emails. 
Even junior specialists medical secretary, I’m quite sure budget would allowed it’s exactly young sacrificed pandemic least risk wait longest. it’s easy older people tell us patient, already got shot traveling vacation.

It’s decided even try. walk clinic without appointment get pop clinic side road. get before, it. fault government elected old people incompetent.   India really deserve given vaccines see objectively. large production capacity even bigger potential government never even wanted vaccinate us never really made plans. things gone really bad started make move get vaccines good amount long, maybe 5 6 months. interesting conversation CNN daily dose doom. issue see Taiwan already AZ vaccines stored struggles get enough ppl vaccinated it, likely due reasons lead Japan ""donating"" vaccine first place. 

It would helpful US senators would help pressure American vaccine producers like Moderna J&amp;J increase capacities. agree 100%. disaster compared gone. Germany end. develop worlds best vaccine make sure people benefit good time. Instead second class countries like Chile UAE. Weird semantics, ""Relative few"" try 10 million country alone. Haven’t saying “it’s weeks!” since February? least city, basically ran vaccines end May second shots. People able get first dose appointment getting end June late mid July. 

I’m biased, though, since I’ve already gotten first dose second appointment secured.   Taiwan India, nobody dying streets. Getting vaccines urgent matter Taiwan numbers still low health system collapsing, ofc important matter regards future outbreaks. Taiwan already AZ vaccine doses stored struggles get ppl vaccinated like Japan vaccine hesitancy common Europe. 

Btw one could equally argue Taiwan also refusing accept vaccines China simply political reasons. could swallow pride like India accepted oxygen concentrators China. Man catastrophic mess! I've missed $20k last year caring others, cut shit out.

So yeah, care myself. 

No one gave shit losses last year, I'm fucking done, especially kind entitled attitude people going trying survive. -all- employees. new. Yup, original article correct /u/shipswimwear quite so. certain number immunocompromised people can't get flu shot die flu year, care death rate low enough acceptable. death rate Covid unvaccinated people reaches similar number, also stop caring Covid.   Well, borrow V Vendetta, instill fear? knows? China closed secretive system it’s hard say maybe accidental leak.

But near unanimous denial possibility lab leak Western authorities? 🤦🏻  I. largest natural resource stupid greedy people. China something nice say that.... know sarcastic. info others, Taiwanese home brew vaccines end phase 2 trials, scheduled made available around July. mean we're going utilitarian point view, need maximize good outcomes right? 

If that's case, making sure things open full capacity benefit everyone vaccinated relative unable get vaccine. Yeah agree you. That's also government got lot heat outbreak. Government really promoting success forward planning combat virus. 

But everything went south May, turned pretty much talk. Testing capacity, medical recourses, pretty much everything limited. Therefore chain control unachievable. Despite stupid fault don’t want see people die hospitals getting overwhelmed It’s end day personally wouldn’t risk it, least fully vaccinated. added comment: slightly 20% US estimated Covid. get herd immunity according math above, need 20% immunity infections cannot counted vaccine immunity camp.

I think math adds up. Sure, get us closer, get us there. What’s odd US said would donating 20 million non-AZ vaccines, announced 25 million said aren’t AZ there, throw extra 5 million? mean donating 85 million?

You’d think Biden admin would active PR department here. Lost point here. bloody mask. Anyone wear one easily. morons refuse it. see reason need lecture mask wearing, know.

Just understand, live Wyndham hot spot Australia. aged care home walk double deaths entire state. 

That take seriously. stop rubbishing whole country live state seems head arse. He's citizen Spain. Care offer opinion elections? Can’t force employees get vaxed. No, really. important point. Almost everyone get vaccine. question whether vaccine effective, small percentage people, like transplant patients late stage cancer patients.

I unsure ""immune deficient people can't get vaccine"" started, really true all.  dad works travel industry getting slammed bookings well next year. Lot places sold well advance. came back Orlando Memorial Day weekend **packed**! think herd immunity comes around 80-90% population vaccinated currently 52% fully vaccinated adults, 63% least partially vaccinated adults. Keeping mind 80-90% number included children 52/63% number not. 

We slowly making way there, definitely range herd immunity moment. imagine take good longer large groups resistant people (not anti-vaxxers per say people hesitant Covid vaccine particular significantly larger group many people realize). state also island could compare New Zealand. guess we'll never know.  almost like vaccination makes pandemic go away. Get vaxxed, toss mask, go back normal. I've read opposites too, like said, depends. ones schools became covid hotspots, year again, depends, level infection community. outbreaks that's seen October probably seen now, even young kids vaccinated. Best practices shared daycare/schools across country. somebody got vaccinated J&amp;J? Hod feel afterwards?   ~~Breaking News:~~ **China ""SLAMS"" United States sending vaccines Taiwan. Calling attempt political gain.** 

*Something along lines wager.* 

However, say U.S good thing sending vaccines Taiwan. Good Job.  first put risk perspective: risk sitting non-stop 10-hour flight example? risks relative; u got covid incubated, would keep close care, would increase risks clots; that's extreme example still

which disorder this; assumig u can't identified arn't famous ect ect.  [Check However, doses going [vaccination [GPs sucking every bit extra supply. First doses vaccination centers stay small numbers weeks improve late June. Well everyone vaccinated yet UK. think Taiwan would accept certainly tainted vaccine enemy state deliberately created exported virus peddling ineffective vaccine? 😂 That’s true though. want buy BioNTech haven’t reached deal yet company. China offered sell vaccines Taiwan refused. Go f  growth getting pretty bad saw guy Twitter say “the way safe start fresh 2022 consider 2021 wash”. find reasoning heavily flawed since Covid seasonal virus, cases, hospitalizations, deaths may well worse January 2022 June 2021, yet wants mask mask later. Interesting perspective Considering vaccine remains effective every single current variant, yes, yes are. don’t think China’s gonna furious relatively small amount doses. still might able persuade Taiwanese government accept SinoVac, PRC’s main goal  Taiwan's laws banning importation Chinese vaccines. Taiwan's ruling party never accept vaccines mainland would huge political loss them. CCP happy sell even provide free vaccines Taiwan reason. Kind weird blame CCP Taiwan's laws used official reason/excuse.

Therefore, really US's responsibility provide vaccines government commercial channel regional influence geopolitical benefits.  Oh don’t. walk everywhere. Family vacations best. takes us two weeks walk see family states.  Ok Pops? “The said wasn’t contagious” citation needed thank much mean ""work""? PPE preventing spread? Right, trying prove/show world  Cool - thanks providing additional color here. 

Seems predicament consequence putting eggs one basket - way Taiwan put eggs border control outbreak chain control goose already loose. 

I’m probably unrealistic though - difficult justify social distancing masks 24/7 outbreaks almost year. steroids working poor blue collar neighborhoods left.

minus people responsible care feeding ***tourists***.

and cleaning tech offices.

&amp;#x200B;

.....this exactly ""gentrification steroids"" 

yet Chinatown better rest city.

&amp;#x200B;

**How San Francisco’s Chinatown Got Ahead Coronavirus**  mean investigation allowed CCP year remove trace evidence, saying stuff like contagious, conveyed CCP. CCP knew false time to, point actually less safe allowing China participate WHO. could told world likely contagious coronavrius, trusted China allowed infected people travel nations. also acting like autonomy like free nations cannot make investigation without CCP approval. mean investigators barred certain areas China could find incriminating evidence. I’m sorry it’s genuinely tragic 24,000 people needlessly died. We’ve 53 deaths (in country ten times population county) think we’ll fine. Well don’t give vaccinated people advantages people won’t get vaccinated. France none one know age group 20-30 getting vaccinated even though there’s dozens appointments 15 Minutes us daily. would say .04% population tiny percentage. Someone obviously didn’t read article might terminology wrong point group people can't get vaccines medical reasons people getting screwed antivaxxers could get choose   reason AZ hasn’t filed paperwork yet. 

The cause stumbled messed clinical trial. Undoing caused time effort. So? cut diplomatic relations ROC, never recognized Taiwan part PRC. established de facto relations de jure public law (Taiwan Relations Act), makes diplomatic relations ROC irrelevant. ROC government China anymore, government Taiwan.

source: part comment made think wishing it? Sorry share pessimism pandemic taught anything people selfish fuck we're stuck while. least I'm fully vaccinated. 

Good lord stupid comment.  feuding China, gets 1.2M vaccines Japan


Spreading good vibes also could looked European data could used vaccine men elderly people...

The blood clots women certain age even less cases instance birth control pills aspirin. 

Not fan AZ, better nothing!

In Europe situation could happy even get shot recently. scary thing kid covid.

I talked plenty parents Case Investigator Contact Tracer California would disagree you. Maybe scary *you*, experience, want ***my*** &lt;12 kids get it. No, people Type 1 Diabetes get vaccine works fine. Except kids 12... You’re putting blood clotting disorders one category. wrong. recessive genes don’t. research. I’ve seen 3 hematologists regarding (because want OVER). 3 told circumstances get vaccine anyone family disorder. vaccines elevate factor V levels. worth get vaccine could possibly die? high likelihood too... And? Since US actually respects UN decisions/resolutions go favor?

Besides, this

Can't make shit up. UK like every country world decades prepare pandemic like this.

Not same, even close. 

This hard anyone IQ greater potato. That's huge news welcome news that! care old people. guys do. 

Look UK society, prioritized 65. Taxes, housing, even social benefits like vaccination priority given pensioners workers students. suspect asking help information extended car warranties it’s unlikely COVID continue speaking exponentially either, half adults vaccinated unknown probably significant amount rest post infection antibodies.

Please note, environmental scientist, virologist microbiologist, get anything wrong, please feel free correct me!

Anyways subject hand.

COVID-19 uses Spike Protein bind ACE-II receptors lining cells. Think spike key, receptor lock. key binds lock, allowing virus inject genetic material cells, ribosomes (Think little protein factories inside cells) begin make copies viral particle.

This Spike Protein coded presented existing vaccines. body learns recognize Spike, thus deactivate Key virus exposed.

A virus mutate different ways. become transmissible different ways, become less deadly ways well, important factor ability evade immune resistance.

In order evade current vaccines, Spike protein would significantly change. delicate process, body develop one anti-body, many different parts Spike. one work, chances many others do. order make vaccine completely ineffective, many parts Spike would change, would likely Key fit Lock. Basically, Spike changed much, physically cannot interact Human cells. got first dose Pfizer vaccine got Muay Thai session tomorrow, wondering it’s okay heavy cardio don’t feel side effects. heard there’s potential blood clots. 

24 Yr old Male. dead stupid get vaccinated reduces chance death severe illness substantially, vaccine magical force field preventing possibility infection transmission indefinite unknown future like many seem believe (because want believe). senseless eliminate indoor masking current circumstances country shedding infection rates even remotely high. Whether uptake lower among rural urban populations important. important point governments done everything shy offering hookers blow exchange vaccinations. Months vaccine abundance, anyone isn’t vaccinated condemned fate chose themselves. kind PROVES isolation works. Exactly. first, didn’t even connect vaccine cycle never told possibility. expected fever, body aches, headache, etc. lot women menstruate included trial...? mostly post menopausal women...? many questions. 

I knew took vaccine element unknown, wouldn’t know weird little things vaccines hundreds millions people take them, I’m angry anything. Maybe bit worried, way. I’m surprised surprised experts article are... like, don’t really want person surprises doctors, know? Haha 

Oh well, that’s unprecedented things. We’re first monkeys shot space. 😂 YoUrE lItErAlLy KiLlInG gRaNdMa!!!!1!! Exactly!  maybe closest advocate mask wearing flu.

Covid special? never disagreed adamantly messaging since said it. They've done shitty job entire pandemic 4 months new administration cannot fix (they put statement couple weeks ago acknowledging airborne transmission, good job guys). read actual studies behind CDC's guidance? People conflated said mean transmission vaccinated breakthrough cases (false - study take showed 48% reduction household transmission vaccinated vs unvaccinated breakthrough cases). Breakthrough cases rare new variants result them. CDC know happen unknown variables unvaccinated also masking, 50% adults vaccinated, new variants vaccines reduced efficacy feature breakthrough infections. mean 25 million total, 6 million going Latin america caribbean. country particular struggling really bad right now, we're grateful donation. That's even close similar situation use emojis weak attempt sarcasm tells enough you. Hawaii pretty strict quarantine. much easier enforce since entry points airports, compared every state.  There’s nothing fear. right thing keep child, precious prized possession planet, away harms way. simple. confess something wrong? going make vaccine doses even competitive. hang living room screaming whatever nonsense long want?

No? Free speech takes another hit 😢 end?? Would prefer public gatherings limits everyone? seem fair either. 

I'm sorry people continue anti vax idiots. That's nice Canada They’ve implemented 1-child policy again… keep daughter away dumb rednecks want absolutely minimize risks. months, children simply kept away places large numbers adults. little reason child ever actually needs large numbers adults are. Yes work. ""Es wurden keine freien Termine Ihrer Region gefunden. Bitte probieren Sie es später erneut."" trust CDC anymore? Sounds like things coming control Europe. Whoa.

I think give someone platform also giving credibility. abuse kick them. totally sympathize needle phobia debilitating. Even independent covid vaccine though, I'd seriously urge getting treatment.

Not true all. Lowest point last year certainly, since beginning pandemic. would total elimination disease. overshoot argument.

We lowest number **deaths** per day since started testing.

True herd immunity something reach couple months. continue outbreaks areas.

I'm wondering might actually bad idea. People (especially young people) often stick together people age group.

So groups everybody vaccinated others nobody is. unvaccinated group virus happily continue infections.

Just randomly vaccinating everybody 50 (after done older high-risk group) might actually break infection chains. That’s also known deaths.  countries way counting like North Korea even knows what’s happening there. actually believe it.

even even worse: believe before, '*the mainstream trying silence her, means must speaking truth*'. replace country empires wannabe empires. Biden giving 25 million donated vaccines beginning relinquish DPA amazing start administration praised it, time needs much pressure increase donations supplies rest world... well convince Europe, China Russia donate supply well. UK..? Biden asked *national intelligence community* redouble efforts investigate. 

I'm sure they'll find honest, transparent, diplomatic way handle this, usually do...

Wonder prompted change? lieu actual knowledge science keeps looking actual answer, conservative media seems hell bent saying ""We already answer!"". *just happens* ""solution"" coincides previous administration's agenda. vaccine good person's immune system. Older people weaker immune systems. That's really it. protection flu works COVID. things already protect protect COVID too.

So things changed them, exactly? already levels. Believe lots warnings european countries like Kent Variant (we called British variant here) seems fall mostly death ears. wondering avoid bullet school summer holidays hit us before. avoid give us chance vaccinate 12+ hopefully adapt school safety measures (although hopes second thing somewhat non existent given experiences past 1 1/2 years.  That's thought. question is, mRNA better live attenuated? Yes thats gathered whatever news got UK, however higher risk infection got two shots high chance mild covid also somewhat lower still existent chance getting it.

But key seems two shots instead one!

Anyway thanks hands info! pretty shit then. don’t diseases, though. Covid isn’t actually much dangerous lot endemic diseases, except nobody resistance spreading control. it’s back manageable levels people degree protection it, there’s much reason cautious Covid flu norovirus. civilized states 60% now. 

In republican-led states half that. Genocide Ok, compare Vietnam, island, ~100 million people, land border China 53 COVID deaths. 

The parent right people US literally care hundreds thousands people around unnecessarily die. They'll lean American Exceptionalism BS could never way. western world using live attenuated MMR, polio flu vaccines?

They require refrigeration also. seems awfully inconvenient using good inactivated versions. Death cost life. I'm early 30s, entire family gone due various illnesses tragic circumstances. get time get, less. spend life bitter simple truth, learn time short, nothing guaranteed, live life according principles. point US government follow guidelines stop virus burning US population. 

Other countries follow guidelines fraction death toll - wait - stopping virus burning population first place. focusing masks missing larger picture. Countries tamped community spread - going amaze - mask mandates. Yeah seeing customers threw temper tantrums year tells lot employees sick tired telling people observe mask policy. last thing want shopper confront remind wear mask stores still mask policies.


These employees already deal enough is. Twitter human right tho? Cases dropping across country, lowest point since beginning pandemic. seasonality, lot we’ve functionally hit herd immunity, least areas disease easiest time spreading. jealous? Lowest case counts world Thank you!

Maybe novavax also “cure” people fearful “new” vaccine technology. offer people Donuts lottery tickets get people take vaccine lol. % adults actually vaccine? wrote that? illiterate baboon? False different disease would kill thim since immunocompromised? money spend? money? interesting (to me) discussion live virus vaccination (i.e. inoculation) live attenuated vaccine based actual SARS-CoV-2 virus currently development. somebody please explain activity around developing live attenuated COVID-19 vaccines like this? 
The way see live attenuated vaccines provide closest thing natural immunity use weakened form virus create real infection. would think would preferable vaccine mimic body's natural immune response close possible. Isn’t it? 
Also understand immune response live attenuated vaccines robust, creating mucosal systemic antibodies T-cell response typically lasts rest life. (I'm educated medical field might wrong.) 
Also, understand common vaccines everyone gets live attenuated vaccines measles, mumps, rubella, polio, flu. 
It seems live attenuated vaccine sure shot end pandemic. So, gives? one obscure company developing one? Agree N95 definitely reduces risk also question level gets better compliance. pretty comfortable cloth masks easier wear day.

This critical manufacturing masks required employees. found spread within community outside work heavy, spread within walls factory pretty low almost non existent outside groups would get together lunches hang locker room without masks.

This south still lot people saying masks effective... like, look evidence right front lol  think that's possible. Taiwan name island. Unless China intends sink island, Taiwan exist long time. Yes indeed uses similar principle clustered antigens. HPV vaccine, basically express “empty” viral particles yeast expression system. HPV nonenveloped virus (no membrane) surface protein tends self-organize particles spontaneously. tweet Belfast peaceful 70s. rate acceptance probably applies eligible adults far, right? Kids age 12, matter want not, yet eligible. Hopefully changes soon &amp; *everyone* wants vaccine get it. good states allowing teens get vaccine without parents' consent case parents anti-vax.  worse covid communicable. situation society changed dramatically, small percentage people highly vulnerable. choice going Disney world late August February. chose August hoping would less people there. Hope I'm right lol. seem like would know: I’m pretty sure HPv vaccine protein subunit vaccine well, right?  Yes, Republic China, commonly referred Taiwan. I’m mistaken, HPV vaccine protein subunit well. People seem think love China don’t support Taiwanese independence, it’s precisely don’t trust China want UN team medical scientists there, corrupt, that’s problem too, really dread day one watching authoritarian states speculation maaybe India? like 'dare give Taiwan vaccines' kinda mad, like ' wtf need too' . Since they're pretty bad spot well Mainland Taiwan? don’t hide them, make sure nobody counts them. Wrong Wsj science mutually exclusive.

And injections ""opinion"" already politicalized discussion sure way never solve question. That's good! everyone else also wear masks you?

I suspect lower chance catch N95, especially many around wear masks, wear chin diapers.

EDIT: Spelling point? damn far tripping brah... 

*""See, day Lord coming — cruel day, wrath fierce anger. . . . put end arrogance haughty. . . . infants dashed pieces eyes; houses looted wives violated."" (Isaiah 13:9–16 NIV)*

*Ibn Ishaq/Hisham 992: - ""Fight everyone way Allah kill disbelieve Allah.""*

I could go on. more... I’ll give everyone quick primer work compare existing candidates.

To begin, need learn word: “*antigen*”. purposes, antigen foreign protein develop immune response. current pandemic coronavirus, main antigen targeting protein surface virus call “spike.” dual-function protein first binds virus particle surface cell infect fuses membrane particle cell membrane, thereby releasing viral genetic material cell start process replication. develop antibodies immune responses spike, protected future infection virus.

The first coronavirus vaccines developed released pandemic call “expression-based” approaches. supply genetic code spike patient’s cells. means patient’s cells start making foreign protein, similar virus does, it’s really good stimulating antiviral immune response. response involves producing antibodies, aspect immune system actually prevent infection, also cells, look inside cells identify destroy cells infected virus. mRNA viral vectored vaccines expression-based approaches newer technologies allow us develop vaccines quickly cleanly. 

I’ll point expression-based approaches ancient. variolation smallpox Edward Jenner’s use vaccina first vaccine expression-based approaches. didn’t know time.

The approach subunit approach. One way grow virus cell culture inactivate something like formaldehyde beta propiolactone inject people additive called adjuvant (usually aluminum salt) cause local tissue irritation set immune response. Sinopharm Sinovac products use approach, doesn’t seem generate strong immune response expression-based approaches.

Novavax using variation this. It’s known cluster antigen interest together little bundles particles, seems generate stronger immune response giving free-floating molecules. also adjuvant seems effective activating right kind antiviral response. Novavax basically expresses bunch spike protein using cell culture system bunches little nanoscopic “bouquets” spike presents immune system adjuvant. generates ridiculously strong antibody response proven clinical trials offer robust protection virus. current GSK “SHINGRIX” shingles vaccine operates principle offers 97% protection shingles.

So approach helpful patients haven’t able tolerate mRNA adenovirus vaccines also used prepare future pandemic viruses. Felt awful 12 hours later. Woke feeling fine sore arm. Europeans better drivers general, speed impact, well designed roads.

Here's local example, TLDR, toll road operator bribes gov higher speeds, leads deaths.

""In case SH 130, however, may also individualized factors contributed significant increase accidents ‘problematic driver behavior’ road. 2012, toll road section highway opened, investigation Austin media shows private toll road company provided $100 million investment payment post speed limit section SH 130 85 mph. theory, higher speed intended ‘incentivize’ drivers, particularly truckers, take SH 130 instead roads like I-35, hopefully alleviating Austin’s traffic problems. borne out. Instead, accident rates risen.

The private road operator, originally proffered incentive payment since gone bankrupt; traffic metrics road simply forecasted. Statistics 2016 showed actual traffic 60 percent lower estimated, much postulated due tolls. drivers prefer free roads, even busy congested, people chose take SH 130 tend want go fast relatively open road. lead serious danger minding business."" wow  strongly disagree ""Good News"" flair here. Censorship never ""good news."" people US embracing authoritarianism. Giving corporations control major social media companies control allowed said allows control much public discourse exists today. Well everyone, are. We’re almost totally back normal least am, US. made it. 

I never take “normal” life granted ever again.  vaccine that's what, 50% effective? country Taiwan country, WHO. addition responses: Taiwan reportedly trouble procuring vaccines PRC interfering ability negotiate vaccine manufacturers. routing vaccines Taiwan, Japan quietly counter mainland China’s influence help close ally - vaccine manufacturers - navigate difficult geopolitical situation. I’m back running errands. sure it’s improvement vs locked lol. Exactly I'm sick point made. virus different them. Whether covid behavior same. sucks get additional sympathy situation like sit flu season etc etc. even read comment replied to? definitely work. India virus first evolved, personally know nearly 15-20 people ( elderly) extended family got vaccinated either got away mild infection get infected despite definite exposure. old old? don’t understand mechanisms would be? younger people’s bodies flexible adapt better variants? work construction industry, evetime visit job site outside major metropolitan area run major company, typically zero compliance OSHA regs regarding eye, hearing helmet/head protection. safety glasses, hard hats, reflective vests, masks ear protection even guys cutting concrete running jackhammers. crazy. 

Then go street big boys 100% compliance across employees.

The problem adds see cultural identity problem point. Men general, particularly blue collar fields like told do. Florida renewed state emergency one final time set end date. Anyone detailed results Pfizer vaccine trial adolescents? hard time finding it. that's likely case. still check community spread levels area, though. CDC US declare epidemics.

I’m happy go bars SF, don’t see many masks anymore. Ive seeing long lines bars frequent past month. Yes lol I'm US citizen living abroad, got first dose, heading back states September week wedding. mad go, girlfriend, EU citizen, also vaccinated, might able go. r/COVID19 I'm convinced assumption people resisted social distancing &amp; masking would eager comply Democrat president. ""How supposed drink beer mask on???""  Problem though, bet half people wearing masks probably vaccinated ever think COVID would get them, even less concerned now. bet half people wearing masks vaccinated extra cautious. 5G kills viruses. wondered thing [Godspeed You! Black  reckless... Axios, though, mean kind hit miss. going away long fertile ground virus... higher vaccination rates.   Taiwan held gold standard entire world. I'm pointing they've missing one important element successful elimination strategy. Taiwan high density stopped keeping virus year, density alone deciding factor. means needed testing even more! 

And NZ low density population. country uninhabited 86% populace urban (higher US) living handful cities similar density US urban area. level density save US protect NZ either. heres vaccine incentives work: california reported administered 134,536 first doses today, means account 25% first doses reported administered today. reference, yesterday reported 104,271 first doses it?! entire world CRASHING around you?! considering young people contribute transmission compare elderly, country low cases probably consider vaccinating young people first.. vaccinating people based job (health care worker, people airport, frontline worker, job human contact essetial worker, etc) prevent future outbreak..
 
countries high number cases save people vaccinating elderly vulnerable first though..  Well case, certainly hope rates continue across world later year. China really produce old school inactivated vaccines billion plus doses per year like claim, there'd certainly enough go around. 

I foresee much anguish reddit 6 months pro anti China commenters bitching pros cons vaccine diplomacy! could told year ago. Always assume people wrong thing. Nearly businesses run normally now. measures bring daily cases vaccination. so? people even get flu summer? Japan? :) Sounds great.Not many 65+ good internet.

As far looked around internet,it depends city live + independent Clinics accepts appointment.(It seems Clinics rule local governments) minimally competent President would implemented program massive funding regulatory streamlining get vaccines soon possible. Thank — going say thing. us kids 12 still can’t go without worry reach herd immunity. mean, I've met people past may inclined say things person says, I've heard described window lickers. thought may appropriate question ask icebreaker.  analysis projecting 12 billion vaccines 2021: stupid mistake posting finishing reading post. I've edited correct it.

China many vaccine manufacturing plants. Sure China look send developing world later year, should. However, countries able mount vaccine drives administer shots quickly China, even India. 

Between poor infrastructure, corruption, wastage, even poorer countries likely able vaccinate quickly efficiently China right now. article recently sub-saharan African nation destroy portion AZ vaccines donated use something like quarter third doses expired. church people held nuts  😂😂😂 actually use different strategy western countries. started vaccine young age group older ones. heard today moved age 79 week. Variant not, hits fast, get less week get everything ready. main fault Taiwan gov failed get essential materials facilities (test kits, machines, hospitals, systems plan) ready hand. Nothing done past year. 
When covid eased last year around April, guess Shanghai gov did? built new building dedicated infectious disease hospital, doubled capacity potential next wave. That's call ""well prepared"". definitely scapegoat. 
I midst mask buying chaos period, jungle there. standard procurement rule window. 
We don’t even time verify seller, let alone product efficacy. 
His options literally
1. Take chance buy product. Get vilified product unsound. 

2. Don’t take chance supplies. Get vilified stock immediately.  governor fucking idiot. too. sensationalist click baiting headlines nerve-wracking. feel ya. mom going 96 year. dad died 10. Time passes quickly friend. MMR actually exception western world. attenuated polio flu vaccines, commonly used inactivated versions. MRNA vaccines lot faster develop. think spread mainly happened places work social distancing impossible (/not enforced non-compliant management), schools. like like windows?

Why would ask that? like honest. 

Do people actually think scientists know certainty happen? small samples, bigger ones, even bigger... everyone... step wait see happen. 

I mean, use term ""big human experiment"" lot stuff, especially food grown. 

So think anyone reacted wants find something get worked about. friend, end True, NZ learned lot outbreak changed practices one. first one last August taught us huge value community surveillance testing. worked front lines healthcare pandemic height, felt like fucking war.

Meaningless death political incompetence combined days rolled weeks weeks months end sight.

There weren’t guns bombs tanks, real trauma experienced there’s good number people working healthcare right suffer PTSD virus families friends communities.

Comparing lives lost victims war way put perspective may able otherwise comprehend number lives lost last 17 months. one knows duration immunity yet. It’s possible it’s short lived. well, political philosophy isnt great idea pandemic, im sure youve already debated lol Yeah I’m sure everyone wishing NY Michigan instead Asians 103 years, would know? even point this? started everybody wore face mask correctly OUTDOORS, worry transmission INDOORS.

Except majority transmission in-doors. get it?

Case 1 gets hotel quarantine. Spreads family. Family spreads friends. Friends spreads workplace. Workplace spreads family. on. Barely anyone spread someone park walking street.

Majority (all) transmission far in-door settings.

Making masks compulsory outdoors pointless great compliance good. almost zero infections outdoor setting Melbourne outbreak far.  Hope like colt 45 Google Fauci herd immunity 90%. First page Google filled sources. Every major news agency Reuters NYTimes article direct quotes Fauci saying this. Dr. Fauci quoted saying originally said 70% want hurt peopyle faith vaccines, particularly given controversy. deliberately put misinformation lower numbers keep people's hopes up. recently February, high officials CDC said NPR interview expect community spread ever stop localized areas. infectious.

Here's one article get caught friends masking social distancing..? Though virus may control, think lot folks feeling going sink gradually. I'm still wearing mask, believe power vaccines, kid who's still eligible vaccine. wear it, either. Dont fucking care anymore. Central Florida ups driver checking in. 

Fully vaccinated still wears mask crowded business. to?


Her claims don’t accurate tp get status


Nobody Florida, even Democrats backing claims


So there’s whole conspiracy hide numbers among everyone? thought said Asian? (Aren't smart?)

If everybody wore face mask correctly OUTDOORS, worry transmission INDOORS.

Even 6 3 year old kids wear one properly.

P.S. Half-Asian. (&lt;-- even point this? started it.) way, Australia, NZ China gotten ""lucky"" they've regular outbreaks hone skills easier variants virus. Taiwan jumping straight hard mode opportunity practice showing. risk. risk low 0. vaccine would drastically reduce risk others around may far risk.

It especially matters people immunocompromised history anaphylactic reactions cannot get vaccinated. rely herd immunity stay safe need people responsible. Vaccinating everyone extremely important. doesn’t make sense me. wants shotgun?? Obviously people lots people use them.

Welcome 'merica... Reddit keyboard bullshitter Health expert actually study hard get degree spend years research sharing opinion public (and name). means lockdown goodness knows long. That's erratic policy sustainable long term. know youre using cdc data point find daily first dose state data? Skipping vaccine looks cost Mr Rahm $1.674 Million dollars. hope worth would talk outdoors I'm talking in-door settings?

Do go restaurant eat masks on? necessarily, death rates vary wildly based original infections sparked Taiwan's cases started primarily among elderly. Melbourne's 2nd wave also crazy high death rates (~20,000 cases, ~700 deaths) definitely missing lot cases. purely wave got aged care homes early on.

Singapore, hand, ridiculously low death rates 1st wave (~50,000 cases, ~30 deaths) confined mostly migrant workers. Everybody's different. sore arm that's it. mom felt like she'd hit truck amor 2 days. dad felt literally nothing. meant say OUTDOORS. I've corrected reply above.

P.S. I'm Asian. US [90% mask compliance yet still saw major spike, said [Spain, Italy, France even implemented stricter People they’ve “asked” regardless country/state results turned less same. science said responsible thing mask social distance, it. science said go get vaccinated, it. science says vaccinated mask social distance I'm not.

It's simple that. 

Children can't get vacced yet immunocompromised continue masking etc. gotta say saw whole lot kids parents store masked make will. always low risk since beginning millions vaccinated americans even safer. got free masks. 
(Not joking. Still happy getting them.) 5 cases country 0 cases big problem.

Only myopic mindset. It’s heatmap education level  I'm talking people households. wear masks indoors go visit mother? dinner gatherings?

Did dismiss masks completely useless? No. would useful going market, supermarkets, retail stores etc.

Learn read actually reply someone.

P.S Asian  would they? Don’t think anyone would prefer live Whitmer Cuomo Newsom despite people Reddit say AP literally media… actually heard that, thanks info.

I team, care it. I'm every bloodsucking politicians want control lives, every one ""mandates"" rules place upon us (but them), matter small large. entire political philosophy summed ""live let live"". I'm one better working ;) wearing P100 respirator flu season this, take damn mask cram urethra.

No body likes flu. Maybe people start wear damn mask they're sick.   understanding (albeit limited) that's fairly uncommon scenario. Meaning virus generally trends towards transmissible lethal – virus lethal, kill host quickly host spread it, subsequently extremely lethal, spread quickly. COVID seemed thrive seemed land perfectly sweet spot quite lethal transmissible. Though I'm sure exceptions, e.g. bubonic plague (albeit viral pandemic).

Take grain salt though, I'm much epidemiologist.    agree! Yo man I’m team  Yes character questionable zero proof back claims Take look many people getting jab

Because majority population eligible yet. included. Stock low reserved 70+ 50+ recently 40+ (with stock running soon).

The vaccine roll speed towards end year bulk vaccine shipment arrives.

A lot people trying call hotline book end waiting hours. Government releasing online booking portal soon massively help bookings/increasing uptake rate. Amazing discovery application mRNA. Katalin Karikó nobel prize winner easy! glad green card arrived shit 13 billion go single shots administered? 🤔 could see better way end pandemic Dave Chappelle show reference. cats could ball never judge book cover, made Got source? would excellent correct See works you: Mate transmission homes workplace (in offices). Masks would useless everyone together long duration limited air ventilation.  trying hide them. released monthly reports excess death since beginning pandemic, like countries do. think problem we’ll see winter numbers go everyone want vaccine (either first time booster) won’t enough supply get stuck again. live New Zealand, probably famous zero-covid country along Taiwan. know exactly elimination strategy meant work. beginning NZ Australia massive regular surveillance testing absolute key part strategy. 

The reason order contact trace must catch outbreak extremely early. regular surveillance testing caught three outbreaks NZ able stopped got beyond contact tracers. people infected links border, links infected people caught everyone cold flu symptoms gets tested NZ. 

Since beginning Taiwan among lowest test rates world unlike India Vietnam developing countries can't afford many tests, Taiwan excuse. wealthy NZ could easily regular community testing. 

Sure enough exactly feared happened, discovered outbreak spread silently community weeks still managed ring-fence it. 

Australia, NZ China also shown safe way react even small outbreak immediate hard lockdown give contact tracing mass testing time find isolate clusters. Taiwan's measures harsh clearly allowed virus continue spread. disappointing worrying. leaves NZ standing alone Covid-free country (aside handful tiny totally isolated Pacific islands). science held far. think continue so. can’t help feel smiling upon us today :,) $1.67M 1st 6 shot lead going final round. Wonder vaccinated. that's terrible luck. sympathies whatsoever. people level exposure COVID19 (ideally vaccination, also natural infection) future infections likely result symptoms closer cold, like endemic human coronaviruses, likely worth massive effort. resources required would likely much impactful spent global health initiatives. instance, there's promising malaria vaccine currently trials. disease kills \~500,000 people every year, young children Africa, sickens millions more. True, number people can't get 'rounding error' 'huge group people need keep everything shut for'. That's say keep vaccination efforts push something close herd immunity get, think keep masking &lt;1% population could continue mask feel need. I’m Australian I’m mad I’m still waiting vaccinated. honest matter flu still wear masks social distance. flu deadly covid contagious like covid. Sure flu kills people scale lockdowns shutting society needed. Plus decades old treatment flu manage it.  Probably not. case count truly low, would better concentrate monitoring variants concern developing future boosters rather pushing doses needed (or wanted).  mean operation warp speed? know article serious issue masks was, meet specifications FFP2, German equivalent N95, KN95 P2 respirators rest world.

If masks question offered similar filtration surgical masks, god forbid, cloth masks, might much use health care workers Covid wards, they're still useful reducing transmission innoculum less dangerous environments. I've heard fake KN95s coming China mid-2020, still spun-bond polypropylene outer inner layers, lacked middle layer electrostatically charged meltblown polypropylene attracts aerosols qualifying respirators. fake KN95s like surgical masks, better nose seal.

So, supply billion masks function like surgical masks, worse FFP2/N95/KN95/P2, better cloth masks, population social assistance recipients may masks all, really ""disgusting"" offer these? long they're inadvertently used health care workers, see issue.

Personally, chose reuse reuse handful old N95 respirators since last February, till reeked elastic wore out. many people respirators, mostly cloth surgical masks.  Never attribute malice adequately explained stupidity. I'm mostly pointing posting article positing one thing may pointed complex, confounding issues immediately evident.

And much covid rate 6,000 Californians would dead COVID-19, tens thousands additional patients likely would landed already overburdened hospitals.""

I imagine numbers could significantly higher rate Floridians infected.

Still 6,000 alive might less important micro scale us, big deal people families people managed get though unscathed.

None suppositions necessarily bulletproof, would prefer caution (and less people dying), ignore health risks sake GDP.

Let's also remember

""[The horrific scale 1918 influenza pandemic—known ""Spanish flu""—is hard fathom. virus infected 500 million people worldwide killed estimated 20 million 50 million victims—that’s soldiers civilians killed World War global pandemic lasted two years, significant number deaths packed three especially cruel months fall 1918. **Historians believe fatal severity Spanish flu’s “second wave” caused mutated virus spread wartime troop movements.**""

We could well risked deadly second wave CA restrictions taken effect... ask many deaths would acceptable even someone government?

Should throw caution wind sake business modern world? I'd guess either Idaho somewhere deep South/Bible Belt. get clicks tone down? /s

I know journalists like really need consider ethics they're putting regards variants, somehow taking years vaccinate everyone Earth we've already hit 37 million day makes economic sense exporters importers vaccines maximize production vaccination numbers. Strange comment make USA among first countries mass vaccinating  Yep. Anti-vax belief pretty good example horseshoe theory action - may opposed reasons, far left far right fringes seem equal disdain vaccine science. Spoiler alert: nature viruses... mutate survive. COVID19 virus trying survive. lot people realize lot poor countries better prepared think terms vaccine deliveries logistics. Even poorest countries realize much positive economic impact vaccinations have, they'll whatever takes get people. First it'll major urban areas countries already logistics, push doses rural areas. Whatever works. still wish people would right thing do, sadly many people won't.  Well lots places US acting covid doesn’t exist still seeing declining cases, Ontario full lockdown much higher cases per 100k. don’t know.. don’t report Yeah, vaccines chief. one intelligent enough buy enough distribute them. always necessary I’m really grateful — wish people would actually pay attention whole “one dose summer” concept instead believing go back normal one dose Thank you, never looked perspective! state NC longer reports weekends state holidays fine it. sure eventually move weekly reports. time move on. Thank you! think I’m feeling ease now. happened, well. yea, state emergency declarations essentially legal things use emergency powers, usually allocate funds otherwise cant allocated aint emergency unless declare it. headline nothingburger, wont stop people pretending somethingburger Huh? Thank you! Oh heyyyyyy Eh, depends things shake variants whether maybe get enough supply keep moving second doses. There’s big clamour roll back restrictions mask requirements it’s likely (especially variants), one dose isn’t enough go fully back normal — really difficult convince people cautious figure “I got one dose, I’m good, let’s party.”  Flu poised wreak havoc upcoming season since guessing strain flu vaccine virus taking break punk people like punked andrew cuomo ron desantis. lull making think theyve beaten virus come back stronger ever Florida highest numbers full month now. They're hiding ongoing failure worst Covid pandemic America may behind us, doomposters far outlast it. see they’re already planning   Ask Charlton Heston. That's problem lot head pandemic response task forces. Yeah lot in-depth knowledge regarding medicine pandemics, often terrible PR skills. rolling 7 day average. sampling week, sampling every day trailing 7 days. Epidemiologists absolutely look 7 day averages try spot forming trends. Well get this. Im American lives Canada lot work US. fully vaccinated Canada consider enough make quarantine upon return. 

Now fly Canada would pay 3k stay quarantine hotel 3 days going house finish last 11 days quarantine. 

But drive US take flights return Canada without mandatory quarantine hotel stay (but still 14 days house).

To drive across PCR test 3 days before. get tested border. give take home test take 8 days later. call video call watch take it.

It’s exhausting ordeal. get keeping people safe. However panel respected doctors (a federal advisory committee) suggested quarantine hotels go away. Also restrictions quarantines removed anyone fully vaccinated. It’s frustrating hearing Canada Govt tell us 18 months “listen science” refuse themselves. **MASSACHUSETTS UPDATE**

Don't worry, take Fall?   person said Florida currently poorly based reported cases. I'm saying that's inaccurate. here, especially first days id get confused looks. I've waiting someone say something honestly, everything right since hit US, masks, constant hand sanitizer, distancing (for part), even bought bidet toilet paper thing. pretty much everything right, meanwhile insane amount people couldnt figure mask nose thing, they're wearing mask alone outside, Fuckin done lol. today I'm Janssen mutant gang.  neighbor wife still vaccinated. days ago, traveling states like Idaho avoid mask restrictions. imagine driving 8 hours avoid anything? knew shoulda fucking waited! could use new truck AR15. hate make political, map looks awfully familiar reason.

Considering prevalent ticks becoming lot places climate warming up, need badly back, re-approve shit!

It human engineered, directly.

Idk 'forgot,' likely origin virus. Catch ya. Absolutely true. Election Qld last year, Liberals first thing going re-open border let Businesses trade usual instead lockdown.

Thankfully, Anastacia right thing. vote centering one point alone. Someone see reason keep us safe. Came say this. Fair enough. Pharmacies always giving gift cards perks flu shots.  Israel also considerably sooner, 95% adults fully vaccinated hit Delta variant yet. country currently really purely AZ percentage mentioned aside UK (which actually quite bit lower, see below), country hit Delta quite hard moment.

Moreover, UK passed the
50% fully vaccinated adults threshold seeing lower efficacy Delta Pfizer well.

While agree AZ turning bit weaker, nearly black white trying portray this. US hopefully continue give vaccines allied independent nations region like Taiwan. hate trump top doesnt change fact post right? Norway enact restrictions swift decisive. late harsh restriction Europe (where proceeded lift prematurely). Also quarantine international travel enforced much strongly rest Europe. think quarantine relation international vastly underrated pandemic. SARS-1 contained, transmission characteristics one actually different. think focus internal NPI shown expensive, unpopular ineffective. Global abandoning cordon sanitaire mistake - even excessive measures problem initial Ebola epidemic (which move towards banning border travel restrictions default epidemic containment policy come about). read article? stumbled upon video YouTube feed today: remember lot people time asking case argument possible governments world conspire together hide indeed man-made would become obvious now. year ago.

Now question is, indeed accidental/intentional leak, there's reasonable likelihood case, many governments, health organizations, reputable journals, etc. almost 100% confidence telling us strain coronavirus natural?

FFS, trust anymore? [try archive Events occur vacuum. Newsom sleazy inept politician recall effort started questionable people, gains traction Newsom's actions. 

It stupid lock restaurants counties except one wineries, allowing keep making money business. stupid go French Laundry enjoy indoor, mask free dining himself, friends lobbyists. 

Even action dumb viewed wider lens. rescind emergency. California's 7 day average 800 dropping fast. hold onto emergency powers need ""just case""? think 136% last survey Sputnik?

What restrictions? mean could easily Google myself. obviously wont May, country (Trinidad Tobago) low case region. two waves control zero deaths per day, cases. Things open, crowds stuff. Mask mandate working well. 

But massive spike worse ever lot people dying every day. desperately need vaccines mass vaccination. Sinopharm OAZ available us that's get.

Also need three week testing arrivals.  people can't get vaccine, though, least vaccine would conceed protection. probably safe possibly effective. bad, modest decent amount. many giving Nepal, Palestine, Mexico? 168 positive cases yesterday, currently 60 people hospitals, course still concern, now, pandemic pretty much Norway.

Taiwan vaccines number 1 thing nuance can't understood General Public without proper marketing tactics education deployed. efficacy lower, still contributes greatly herd immunity protects individual 100% time. oh pay wall?

Pfizer/Moderna holding OK variants (they less effective Indian variant still 50% effective believe) Deaths always lag cases, compare average deaths per day cases every wave there’s noticeable delay. 

It takes people die COVID, think we’ll hundreds per day least another month. American followed COVID news since started think mess certain politicians downplayed impact virus advised people drink bleach instead got control became necessary wide area lockdowns.

IMHO lockdowns problem, many governments across globe failed protect small business provide sufficient economic relief citizens.

Also I’m certain Gavin Newsom implemented lockdowns based personal viewpoints followed advice virologists, etc.

Personally support lockdowns implemented city despite fact messed mental health guess post lockdowns recover. moment pandemic/virus/eventually vaccines became political, wrap America.

The thing restrictions going point hamstring local tourism industry economy general.  know they’re eligible? every place like US… Bit difference vaccine shown similar efficacy levels new strains Loll  chance vaccinated person getting always wear mask around potentially-unvaccinated people virtually zero.

I also think odds vaccinated person catch passing along someone else low. 

Unless local area big surge think share mask-free smiles grandmother continue wear mask whenever around people might vaccinated. 

I think gram lucky you. getting downvoted? You’re right. think Europe reopen American tourists? I’m wanting go somewhere point year. know Greece open, still extreme restrictions? Also, go saying everyone including children vaccinated now, still finished priority groups. forget - “successful” western countries (like Germany) significantly closer America’s numbers Australia New Zealand.

Great point. People ignoring this.


In terms mortality/100k, US either better, similarly bad, to: 


UK, Germany, Czechia, Sweden, France, Spain, Italy. “Now virus we’re talking about, lot people think goes away April…with heat.” Actually Florida new daily cases look like states US Daily New Cases chart. They're fine, almost everyone least US. Move on, nothing see here. ones exist yet?? That's amazing!! /s Sadly, don’t see huge effort USA change anything significance preparation next pandemic. totally messed lives many people, people, especially upper middle class above, inconvenience even boom. example, financially I’ve never better like option work home. I’m saying nonchalant attitude pandemic future pandemics right practical moral level — it’s — foresee difficulties getting political truly invest prepared. shouldn’t incentive getting at. People getting know understand virus puts families risk. comparing war help less empathetic find empathy situation. 

Except difference dies. 


Pandemics kill old young (usually.. Thankfully time around young spared). 


Wars kill civilians except ethnic cleansing wars like Ostfront WWII, majority war deaths young, healthy, economically productive men.



There equitable comparisom wars pandemics.



That downplay tragedy lives lost covid-19, all. overall economic impact felt due restrictions emplaced, actual deaths, stark opposition war. No? made cry... right!!! Bingo. people downvoting you? That’s good point capitalism core driven consumers. consumers push towards environmentally friendly products, companies forced follow suit provide viable meat alternatives. 

Plus, eating meat straight cheaper. food/grocery budget gained much breathing room since limiting meat consumption. 

I don’t think it’s necessary push 100% veganism/vegetarianism alienate people helps, believe it’s simple limiting meat consumption special occasions even week. They’re inside factory spread apart. Panic indeed exacerbates cardiac symptoms. chill. Literally that’s 3 nights hotel. chunk change talking thousands dollars here. way Americans understand. care American deaths unless cause death foreign. ""power"" also legally necessary order certain things. fact, currently 33 national emergencies thats active right now, one national emergency place since 1979. course, people wont able tell without googling it, goes show national emergencies complaining national emergencies nothingburger I'm talking deaths. I'm talking hospitalizations, lag much. [First case P.1 midwest Since grown 22%. Gamma makes kids sicker transmissible, pediatric hospitalizations March-May Dec-Feb. every single person wore mask religiously awake would made much difference. Yeah. We'll see plays next 2-3 months. none. Yes, Meh. Yes Also 2bn people received vaccines, soon need booster shot. So...yeah demand decrease. don’t know anyone cares, it’s time turn page.

I started commenting subreddit April, I’ve followed pandemic since handful confirmed cases five countries Pacific Ocean away. couldn’t predicted then-- middle third year college-- much would upend life *so many others.*

But also couldn’t known, amid California’s winter surge, quickly would turn around. I’m one least 73% people aged 12+ San Diego County 68% statewide who’ve gotten shot (S.D. H.S.S.A., C.D.C.). Fewer people testing positive point crisis.

I’m fully aware COVID’s still around, I’ll continue take precautions time being. find subreddit contributes loop irrational anger stress. appreciate reading different perspectives, sometimes-- albeit rarely-- conversations get ugly. back, someone replied one comments shamed getting vaccine. Big thanks moderators shutting fostering healthy discussion overall.

And... it’s time turn new chapters. Two days California “graduates” pandemic, I’ll graduating college in-person ceremony. It’s much, it’s finally day look forward to. see friends haven’t seen while. go first road trip host first party year. course, can’t revert effects pandemic life, it’s time looked ahead.

I might continue lurk COVID-related subreddits. unless things turn south again, I’ll go back commenting gaming, music, sports, communities. 

As parting word, go get vaccine. you’re somewhere hasn’t fortunate U.S. been, continue mask distance. hang there. I’m cheering on. 👋 wanna know whats hilarious? ron desantis greg abbott renewed state emergency declarations pandemic, yet one calling tyrants. almost politically motivated, Cancer free people pay cancer treatment though huh Stop trying. anything pandemic proven people cannot accept facts. work like that. vaccine protects variants probably always will. pretty much go back normal now. makes feel proud read article. Kariko deserve Nobel Prize. silver lining whole debacle. vaccine. going say same. Urban counties higher vaccination rates. Rural counties cause overall state numbers lower. even varies zip code. urban zip code 27% fully vaccinated. Two zip codes over, 60%. shows testing still utterly awful missing maybe 90% cases. Thailand recording similar number deaths recording around 2,500 5,000 new cases day weeks. Taiwan recording 250 500 new cases day, meaning missing vast majority hope stopping outbreak without much serious lockdown. Non-essential travel sounds funny. 

Imagine 150 years ago. reuse old one ok?  country one oldest populations hurting them.  outsider feeling Americans might longer ""a flag rally around"" anymore.

exactly this.

there joke HIMYM like decade ago, common knowledge people chose ignore trump, people understood doubled down.

there's like 40% corner remaining 20% swinging two, sustainable.

that plus scientific illiteracy selfishness large portion population doomed covid response, show whatever next crisis is. Difference cannot general 

Unless figure workaround really going stay unvaccinated Listen Florida. can’t 1,000 daily cases post stats. People posting there's antigen tests, even still, travel they'll let vaccinated.

Not vaccinated, false positive issue keeping getting test/results would get expensive fast. Buying last second ticket cheap, mention lodging, mention work.

Honestly though I'm even sure legal. home country required let in, otherwise could get odd expiring visa/deportation issue go.

Of course even dumber part requirement flying, could get Mexico could still get US.  What's like like windows? almost like there's vaccine something. not? Starbucks week! yes funding though--that usually holds back progress. would scrutinizing Biden created operation Warp Speed lead quickest vaccine creation history? probably not. decision April 15 year **shorten airline pilots' quarantine period three days** could blame current surge, 200 new local cases confirmed per Infected pilots introduced U.K. variant coronavirus Taiwan spread “hostess bars” Taipei’s Wanhua District. **reluctance staff patrons associated bars made contact tracing difficult**, according Florida’s like 50 55 highest new amount new Daily cases this... must everything normal common sense science. see Florida huge amount vaccinated low population density 40% vaccinated.  Maybe missed article, Covid cases number fairly irrelevant. Covid cases % tested extremely important. becuase numbers low mean much without knowing many tested. litterally sounds like trumps plan, test less show fewer cases.

If missed something said US lowest point % total test ignore comment. anyone known community transmission Covid-19, suddenly got Covid-19 someone infected bypasses quarantine checks wanders around community spreading it?

By argument: wear face mask social-distance (even though Government repeatedly recommended do), KNOW infected cases walking around community, right? called PREVENTION. I'm guessing never heard it?

If known outbreak (however ""small"" think is), resulting community transmission (again, however ""small"" think - try telling families Covid-Departed cheer up), paying attention learned anything year half.

I, hand, try learn other's mistakes take precautions. Hope late one day. Tutorial completed. main goal: Brazil.  It’s end COVID, nearing end pandemic. I’m optimistic vaccine turnout increase three factions people: 1. People willing get vaccinated right away; 2. People antivaxxers viewing vaccine political tool; 3. People non-political overly anxious/conspiracy theorists want see rest us fare vaccinated mRNA vaccines.

Group 2 hopeless, herd immunity, opposition less harmful case study natural selection.

I think see group 3 willing vaccinate soon. Especially FDA fully authorizes it, it’s emergency authorization. Also, kids starting get vaccine well. Things looking good. Next pandemic we're going full 12 monkeys. Wait... share good news Chinese vaccines here. like it. eligible, you? sane people work like made get appointment. monitoring 30 websites weeks. incentives unable appreciate relative risk. state lifting restrictions 15th. saying follow CDC? Surface transmission somewhere around 1 10,000 chance. Lol makes sense  son college UK past two years haven’t able visit since 2019…trip canceled last April…we’re US frustrated restrictions won’t lifted yet…give us break! dió un bajón cuando vi que los estados mas pobres yankis tenian un mayor nivel de vacunacion que nosotros jaja Nowhere say that. think completely new variants popping over.

What others think wearing vinyl/plastic gloves addition masks? wearing gloves addition wearing double masks. using hand sanitizer addition wearing gloves work?

For example, go grocery store, I'll wear masks, vinyl gloves, careful cart (wiping down, hand sanitizer, etc.). I'll make purchase, also clean card wallet checking out.

Then, get home, we'll sequester bags spray diluted bleach wipe down. course, done milk cartons, etc., food can't sprayed.

Then, we'll use food items purchased. Power addictive gone april... like magic Tyrants seldom do. news? ""It's 15 soon number 0""

Trump right along. missed timeframe. im visiting! yes, algiers tehran alike cairo south africa gave away? total inability handle last one? 2 dose  yes exactly get covid vaccination? think possible could carry give someone else without getting it? hear saying. Yeah, may wear masks long time. think good idea general. 

I concerned strains hear news.

I wonder good idea go out. slowing us since early April... daily vacinations.. vaccinated subject tests. would like think that, vaccination numbers lagging behind lot state might see resurgence. I’ll pray opposite happen, we’re far 70%-85% country, let alone South. think it’s odd incentivize vaccination? Sorry coma past 15 months? really can’t think reason that? Damn feels like yesterday 300,000 cases every day hear saying could get clothes spread around? issue strains.

&amp;#x200B;

I appreciate kindness. :) basically indoors whole time isolating others. forget apparently US money? time project bluebeam Lebron James really cagey abount answering vaccination status too? Like dodging question ""that's personal question family"". boggles mind guys make millions millions dollars based health vitality would gamble away taking shot. would great number higher, honestly, family friends fully-vaxxed, good go. Unsubscribe subreddit, go live life -- make time lost last year-and-a-half. interesting. appreciate sharing this. But, another strain there? something concerned about. Would possible could spread someone else though? worry people well. want get less severe version well though. held dumbass example. 1.6 million waited get first jab got notified contact.

Every single one anti-vaxxers going get sick eventually. understand want milder form illness. totally would / am. odds friend even infected already really low. odds vaccinated person gets infected low (and assumes hanging they're infected.) Per CDC, vaccinated person even need quarantine known exposure positive person unless show symptoms.

Would possible could spread someone else though? worry people well.  Nothing suggests need boosters besides companies trying make money. Fully vaccinated people coming place high case load still likely infected US.

It make sense e.g. India. Entire family, friends, fully-vaxxed.

Went bar-hopping first time close year-and-a-half, last night. exciting see people about, too. giddy.

 far I'm concerned, pandemic over.   hate much insane. side thinks trying take freedom away one form another. 

It's gotten much worse past years  Oh wow Probably not, contexts therapeutic vaccines help infections certain viruses. Indian variant would like say hi! I'll add one thing I'll add mentioned people. number people currently infected US extremely low dropping day. go US average (it's obviously higher locations others) something like 1 every 23,000 Americans tested positive last 10 days. chance even ending proximity someone who's infected low chance becoming infected vaccinated individual rare scenario *tiny*. then, even somehow managed beat *incredible* odds chance pass vaccinated grandma extremely small chances gets seriously ill even smaller. point well beyond one million chances. get that, find odd states going level get people get shots. 

But takes bribes get people get shot. it’s really bad idea. Though, something misinformation that’s going around. Freedom Speech Press go far. Thats horrifying. huge market it, anyone outdoors shit would love vaccine lyme disease. 99% sure know get fully vaccinated.

""I already Covid antibodies."" Hostess teahouses played part: People outside shouldn’t need wear masks. Transmission incredibly low there. *cries country people dont use masks* rule well get rapid tests (I've done it).

It sucks, least rapid tests half price PCR tests. Canada also far spread US. look population density places like Northeast far densely populated anywhere Canada. Eh seems like excuse, Canada effectively started March well half country least one dose now. better argument since Australia among best job keeping Covid out, perhaps vaccinations, important, less urgent actually shit together. Canada's regional leadership half assed measures fucking us months, bar eastern provinces instituted effective regional bubble Blanket statements bullshit, regardless source.  got back store almost like 2019 again. 

At least half shoppers wearing mask, included. intercom occasionally saying CDC says vaccinated people wear mask please continue wearing one. That's extent covid 19 precautions every store I've last couple weeks. think restaurants bars 100% capacity yet, sure. believe 4th July everything drop.

I think summer wide open everywhere US. vaccinated great summer. I'm going challenge personal mileage goals (walking) break higher level summer. Can't wait! New Zealand Australia beaten virus. They've bought time.

Their vaccination programs somewhat disastrous various reasons: lack actual vaccines, infrastructure, complacency, vaccine hesitancy (might high 30% Australia). Since virus never took hold there, vulnerable populations.

The new variants spread much, much faster original strains, they're still mutating. Australia's quarantine system sees infection breach every two weeks average.

Given factors, they're dangerous place. need speed improve vaccination programs soon suffer massive outbreak. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

I keep hearing good stuff Sinovac. much Sinopharm though. said competent govt isolated country 5 million could handle well.

Can read? said government manage pandemic population 5 million. isolated island country makes even stats back up. New York City urban 29.7% immigrant according census here.

Before spit meaningless numbers, learn basic statistics? Immgrant percentage mean shit diversity. countries immigrants coming from? race/ethnic groups? importantly culturally diverse groups? Auckland barely 1.5 million people, NYC 8 million. Almost [800 spoken there. Nowhere world beat Okay, isolated Iceland 350,000 people competent government high Covid numbers?

Iceland barely 30 deaths less 50 active cases. yapping about? Also, Ireland ""isolated"" island? call troll? Please buzz toy ""country"".

Thank China. Come United States. Get vaccines exported around world. beat thing time. you’re saying unvaccinated people still get covid? San Francisco consistently one best places North America whole pandemic. surprised Lmao Japan kinda based rn. think several points accurate here. First, keeping demand vaccinations high good thing. want end like US habe lotteries reach higher vaccination rate. Second, habe sit home. last week went vacation together fully vaccinated girlfriend. Literally difference show vaccine pass provide negative test result border Austria. top head, can't think one thing allowed city not. countries deciede let vaccinated people in, nothing extra rights given vaccinated people German government. Also, far everyone vaccinated wants it. currently 45 percent WHOLE population (including 18) vaccinated, meaning 60 % adults received first shot. Since around 80% get vaccinated, 20% gap. Finally, restricting rights vaccinated cured unconstitutional, little choice here.  need know: 

Does CN developed vaccines stop epidemic: Yes

Does CN developed vaccines prevent death serious illness: Yes

And require vaccine, slightly better slightly worse parameters, vaccines market (UK, Indian, Russian, european, USA China) good vaccines.  way many exemptions. Somehow considered safe go eat crowded restaurant mask hour sit movie theatre mask 2 hours. also tons morons huge parties following restrictions wearing masks properly. think mot get people angry. It’s fact wanted give masks poor, homeless disabled, knew useless. returned them. Well heard Mister Young sing 
Well heard ol' Neil put 
Well hope Neil Young remember

Alabama doesn’t want vaccines, go somewhere used. Goddamit, literally fight way get vaccine. could get shotgun least. sometime really hate living Europe... though customers able maskless June 15.

Which real bullshit cause staffs mask protects customers customers supposed protect staff, fuck wage slaves guess. children. flu dangerous children. mutation flu COVID might make worse... believe actuals, hypotheticals. resigned long time ago.

Wonder France resort weird watching post-Truth era going like this... demand AZ vaccines Japan. 

Japan gesture repay Taiwan's efforts 311 earthquake, gives Taiwan unused AZ vaccines. Japan praising though, like ""Sorry, know need international vaccines like Biontech Moderna, now, hope helps.""

China course unhappy Japan. China stopped Germany's Biontech supplying Biontech vaccines directly Taiwan, since China claimed Taiwan must get Biontech China's Fosun pharma instead. Nah, knows shitty build would offer.  person would suggest move anti vaccine city it’s likely won’t vaccinate things either. to. Specific cities/states world much connected and/or developed and/or population managed pandemic well.

That proposition. said competent govt isolated country 5 million could handle well. can't name others completely change definition. I'll take admission first statement wrong. idiotic. actually visited subway NYC? That's microcosm world. Nowhere world diverse NYC even major US coastal cities.

You can't actually back evidence none. simply betraying ignorance insulting statement. actually grew Boston, lived Washington DC years regularly went NYC family friends there. know personal experience NZ diverse immigrant. 

But stats back up. New York City urban 29.7% immigrant according census 

The Boston urban area 19.2% immigrant 69% White population according Auckland, according [Stats 41.6% immigrant 53.5% White. far immigrant US East Coast urban area diverse Boston, major US coastal city. density depends population area. fail basic math? 5 million total population still insignificant, smaller cities countries like India China population.

Okay, isolated Iceland 350,000 people competent government high Covid numbers? Ireland, also island, similar population major world transit hub. 

Regardless obviously troll interest actually backing arguments, throw insults. using throwaway account hide changing argument whenever thwart response. $50 gift cards first 2 million people get fully vaxxed announced program may 27th

i looking numbers earlier tonight saw overtook maryland terms % adults vaccinated today, significant maryland overtook us like week ago. could reporting issue regardless, lotsa people getting vaccinated counts It’s US, China…? 

It’s either J&amp;J, Pfizer, Moderna, maybe AZ batch got cleared You’re totally right.  proves preventative/containment measures much. Taiwan perfect grace period little cases population could've gotten vaccines quickly, instead focused much preventing population got complacent. hope that, company like Amazon would surprised main intent keep pandemic going little longer increase sales continue.  


I hope I'm wrong read Amazon every day fear I'm right. chinese vaccines suck... little 50% effectness... moderna BiontecPfizer 90%

Also dont know deliver... taiwan also would nur Trust China seem bit callous. pro-China country Americas try undermine US influence. Like Soviets tried Cuba things got close midnight. Well alrighty then, thanks sharing. real news article would prompted original response. Get vaccinated folks! US dumping AZ stocks too, claiming donations lol Spoken like someone children democrat hate guy much. handled pandemic bad…. needs lift state emergency go back normal @ 70% vaccination rates..  hold due blood clotting concerns That's awful. world needs change this. cares, vaccines vaccines.  checked covid vaccines, there's people can't get vaccines due conditions requires herd immunity keep safe pointless suffering. think vaccines 100% effective everybody either, small percent still vulnerable otherwise protected herd immunity. Sorry rest society it. Everything opened back isn’t going back Florida doesn’t want public knowing shit job they’ve done pandemic? I’m shocked. /s China never something without wanting gain something, mentality something good heart!

They want access Brasilian resources! science says masks end COVID! Good news indeed, hope people Brazil finally realize much liar fraud Bolsonaro basically dismissed vaccines upfront! ain't yet folks. hate excuse too, feel way age, exception - rule. Part growing realizing mortality, people late teens early twenties gotten yet.
 
They need better, sure, fact tremendously surprising. Another part (there TX) ignore virus &amp; publish death condition primary. Thus, states massive jumps pneumonia cases, &amp; suddenly virus. Yeah, argued moron yesterday that’s going new variant gonna tear US next weeks. - explains HIV evades immune study highlights challenge generating HIV-neutralizing antibodies. gp120 appears inactive single molecules viral debris. Future vaccines generate antibodies target site vulnerability gp120 envelope spike. “We know factors guarding site,” Kwong says. “The next step learning overcome barriers.”

If vaccine able cause body generate proteins would create antibodies would successfully latch onto HIV virus - vaccine, able completely remove HIV cells already infected, would almost stop infecting cells, decrease viral load blood near-zero. effect similar curing it. Maybe circumstances virus dies body time.  pushing idea nothing wrong &amp; one sick.

Florida &amp; Texas, least, policy report deaths caused virus anything else caused (which disease always works: damaging process).
This, states precipitously lower deaths virus, without anything slow it, &amp; massive rise corollary death conditions like pneumonia.

Neither state wants admit anything; perceive virus liberal issue (what?) jab Trump (of course)! really see problem. Since books got invented nonsense ideas making way around world. big parts world nonsense books basis government policy resulting religion becomes official. 

Gullible people always find way taken advantage bs peddlers. That's never going happen. pointless wait lift restrictions. Simply supply can't meet demand. Sputnik V vaccine still made tried-and-true viral vector method. Covid proteins carried viruses harmless humans. viruses still take time grown make much slower make new type vaccines, mRNA vaccines, namely Pfizer-BioNtech Moderna vaccines, made US UK. two countries high rate vaccinations thanks mRNA vaccines.

Furthermore, Sputnik vaccine made slower make viral vector vaccines first dose second dose differ other. make vaccine much effective giving total immunity independent tests shown Lancet report far important make COVID infection mild enough, preventing COVID hospitalizing killing infected totally eradicating disease vaccines use shown completely. Honestly expecting 65+ people use reddit really happy age diversity reddit. really need ! Apparently much capacity mass produce it. also questions quality batches make.

 Iirc, South Korea actually approved it, manufactured SK, local quality control. I'm sure concerns coming from. Maybe experts toured Russian factories happy behaviors/procedures saw? Florida called Northern Brazil.  agree eventually issue, right EU around 40% vaccinated one dose (&lt; 20% two doses). see harm prudent hit 60s, end July. could theoretically, people go much effort travel. Plus would illegal forge government documents purpose. Even handful people manage slip fake vaccination proof, big impact covid spread people get vaccinated worldwide. single dose AZ mRNA vaccines 20% effective Indian variant, yes. Science correspondent Guardian aware I'm sure. I've learned far, really think unfair compare vaccines efficacy many different factors came testing, timing such. Vox put really [informative one cannot compare different available vaccines.

I hope people (although understand old woman mentioned) would research instead looking plainly media tells us. what's incentive California? China something good once.   U.K. isn’t seeing growth hospital numbers. That’s stat matters.

All UK cases largely confined 40’s - group likely mix haven’t yet offered vaccine. What's death rate group? come rural area. guess going see seasonal headlines rural communities (low vax rate areas) getting ravaged years come.

Rural communities already facing economic extinction, like sprint towards actual extinction. Matt Hancock said today latest scientific advice Delta variant, first detected India, 40% transmissible Kent strain. Wow cannot believe downvoted here. wrong people. can't conversation vaccine passports, already implemented many countries totally implemented US easy way protecting vulnerable forcing house arrest. 6.8% population vaccinated, virtually 0% antibodies prior contact virus. There's endgame there. Unless get herd immunity fast, matter time. Care elaborate AZ MRNA doses then? 

I also heard contracted obscure company doses too. 

My Taiwanese gf’s parents blame president making ill-conceived deals vaccine developers early on. really don’t facts. That's need fully vaccinate everyone.  Cases [rising expected?

What's alternative? cannot continue full lockdown Covid extinct worldwide, even eradicated within borders constantly reintroduced international travelers. point we've basically hit herd immunity, risk spiraling control again, time treat like disease. surprised much good accomplished raising awareness. people always risk, since invention vaccines.

US Japan donation, Taiwan received 500K 610K AZ vaccines, WHO's Covax program despite contract Moderna 5 million doses contract AZ 10 million doses. think receiving first batch Moderna 150K doses week. delivering them, least vaccine side. got flu vaccine, thankfully proven prevent severe disease people like him. People seem bring flu lot think 1:1 comparison Covid, know isn't. say friend died fully vaxxed Covid. 36. India need vaccine. need raw materials make own.

Oops, admit confuse figures two similarly named vaccines one comments - edited comment clarify, thanks. 
 
In fact Sinovac initial claimed efficacy 85% remember right (I say 'claimed' studies never published peer reviewed - think still been) various numbers given precious little data, real world studies came along showed lower. 
 
My comment issues trial (mostly young men) indeed Sinopharm vaccine though. fact note issues page Low infected places + full vaccination infected places + full vaccination + negative PCR test - problem?

Vaccinated countries whose allow travel shooting leg. booked long-deferred honeymoon Paris September. excited return travel. really. addressing comment said could get herd immunity vaccines alone.

I seen studies this, circle, every single person Covid also gotten vaccinated. Venn diagram pretty large overlap guess big union two sets is. Ok... conversation. summary conversation gone point view this:

“Ok vaccinated returning normal”

“You’re selfish assholes!”

“Ok, want us instead”

“Just chat it” beer good quality warm. Quality stout better slightly chilled even room temperature really cold suggesting Dr Fauci didn’t secretary? overabundance caution. Ireland os 11th may 553,304 people received AZ vaccine reported deaths although reported events thrombosis result Every vaccine approved far approved emergency use. One criteria approved way options. first 3 got approved options, even one two shut distribution whatever reason. So, vaccines approved emergency use. They'll approved normal route takes much longer.  Worse expected. going really damaging especially harmful countries good containment efforts low vaccination rates (i.e S.E Asia/Oceania) Over.

The 3-week spacing chosen speed trial; tested that's used rollout US almost every vaccine uses larger intervals.

Canada UK good results longer spacing (3-4 months).   offensive people actually experienced war kinda wish higher percentage participation someone middle stem cell transplant immune system.

What friend Flu Season this? saw list reasons above, none ever done (masks, vaccine passports etc).

Would felt much anger everyone else passed flu vs Covid? Thanks sharing concerned people choose get vaccinated facing repercussions choices? Probably lot easier screen unvaccinated applicants fire current employees refuse. Also one valid conspiracy theory/issue vaccines fast development testings.... Sputnik V first. live New Zealand, I’ve vaccinations (Pfizer) lived normal life last 12 months now. Fairly confident beaten covid key point ordered mean delivered.

A lot ordered earlier clear would work, prove safe, produced large scale, unusual problem etc.

Even vaccinated countries high vaccination rates wondering next batch vaccines delivered. 

I doubt rich countries take delivery many times needs sit expire. Leaving aside humanitarian imperative, many political gains vaccine diplomacy. Japan delivered Taiwan 1.24 million doses AstraZeneca 's coronavirus vaccine Friday can't right. Maybe 700k excluding donated doses. No, asking all. Never ever said need ""stay inside forever"" honestly become meme point lived US forced stay inside two weeks 2020. people living normally minor adjustments wear mask distance. that's besides point. I'm asking able return normal start th conversation vaxxed want get vaxxed protection. apparently Reddit means want world stay closed forever. Hon, fanboy USA, said might trigger complex peeps, me, would said yup, something learnt whole UNGA 2758 saga back uni. Non-paywall link please? Delta variant 40% transmissible, health secretary says, **adding protection good two doses vaccine**

Vaccine status: Still working. Small island nation. one point little reputable sources evidence support theory. changed bit along media narrative. Well wasn’t money made staying safe would anyone encourage it? companies profit vaccine course they’re motivated!

/s don’t understand posts. It’s like nobody trying increase global access; US everyone realizes this. And, far, vaccines beat variant. messages negative — post positive overall — act it’s inevitable back square one. feel like people pandemic brain conditioned negative even there’s evidence it. one reading comment need edit mate *lol* antivaxer? kid take precautions like wearing mask? take theme parks? said don’t care antivaxers, don’t know kid. kid can’t get vaccinated that’s different antivaxer. didn’t choose immune deficient. Also, he’s one deficiency. can’t expect people accommodate expense others. Maybe wear N95 school keep getting home schooled. want kids go school kid can? care antivaxers? ones putting kid risk, care them?  Isnt last year extent? could also make argument gay rights, trans rights, small, marginalized group. Stuff like happens every year. Social media amplifies US 2nd (after USSR) actively kick RoC UNSC, replace PRC.

Yes, US ""betrayed"" Taiwan (China)/Republic China. No, mean big enough admit misinterpreted wrote that. based tone previous statements that's took it. bad apologize.  simply corrected common misunderstanding vaccines herd immunity. Every piece data says going get based vaccines alone. may get combination vaccines ""natural immunity"" (which nice way saying people going get sick get immune), even uncertain know long immunity lasts.

But, end day, herd immunity noble goal probably always impractical. Even achieving herd immunity US would mean global herd immunity, Covid almost certainly stay. goal becomes slightly different, reduce societal risk Covid something acceptable. enough immunity enough people getting sick disrupt society. risky things every day, simply need Covid within risk tolerance.

I think close that, already there, US. still red spots maps, infections, hospitalizations, mortality trending towards zero places. measure using open rather gotten herd immunity not.

All say believe time restrictions reduced/removed. also realistic enough know may see variant breaks vaccine immunity, case back, another matter. change fact slow vaccinations month due second doses. happened uk. think similar curve them.

End March slowed due 2nd doses. point next week. word fear ""ally"".

Mostly trust ally sentiment. That, hope countries chip vaccines. Russian products would help ease logistic Probably they’re mostly younger live outside. Seems like obvious answer tbh

Also homeless people die time one gives fuck. Doubt would counted towards Covid deaths Which,according west, ""violation human rights"" (somehow) think type person frequents sub type freak people wearing masks walk street take trash. saw people saying mask usage wasn’t high Philadelphia live. past month don’t think saw 10 people without mask store year them... shaken, stirred. made prediction based biontech &amp; moderna deliveries, without Johnson AZ  u kidding? Chinese republic Taiwan, way saying fuck u China :)  Well, must forget official name Taiwan actually semi-censored word eyes Beijing, ""older China"" ""other China"" even called ""real China"" ""original China"", it? Republic China, unfamiliar name, feel free look list countries UN Security Council, might surprised.

😎 dreaming. won’t happen. 50 yo olds still waiting get first shot. see way people age get next month (34yo). TL;DR I've read

- current vaccines contain instructions body create spike proteins

- new type protein subunit vaccines already contain necessary spike proteins

- proteins created plants (outside body, obviously)  knowledge entire unvaccinated human population social distancing masking place? statement provably false blatantly overstated.

The places infections still occurring mutations emerge. That’s theory, it’s based decades evidence study viruses. new vaccines protect us variants far. entire point viral mutation _the moment_ mutation occurs evade vaccinated immune system, spread population slowed lack every country/state/city one size fits strategy makes sense.

Not taking basic, simple, inexpensive steps slow possible spread infection can’t see detect _after emerges_ makes sense. doesn’t matter local infection rate vast majority humans still susceptible virus throw new mutation time. happens, vaccine changed, trials re-run, vaccinations start again.

I chance getting vaccine anywhere right now. Since GP doctor nobody even put waiting list. countries much better job. lower death rate point showing that. [U.S. Donate 750,000 Vaccines enough approve lifted. They’re still required unvaccinated per cdc advice required everyone mass transit hospitals.  Yeah don’t like premature victory talk. depress vaccinations. that’s really need. That's takes *two*. lift restrictions everyone. It’s many countries done. Germany wasteful pointless testing restrictions. voted Newsom. 

If 15th what's promised I'm voting recall, period. 

Why? Full capacity = job exists u make money.

If fucks there's reason to, I'm done defending I'll make sure vote Cox Jenner, whoever else next election can.

This leadership, pandering ""listen science"" group.  blood clots Herd immunity thing. enough people get vaccinated, possibly measures kept like indoor masking cases driven down, could well protected. also huge miss Newsom. 

He needed say yes, stands capacity restrictions likely gone 15th. understand case, businesses NEED assurance existence literally depends it. 

And sure recall if, idiotic reason, Newsom decides keep things half capacity summer. 

Fuck, voted dude, liberal, 100% vote recall alone retribution happens, impacts paycheck heavily summer months...and im alone...    We're one talking it. one cares except people actually situation.

For reference, Taiwan total 260 covid deaths, recent spike last 3 weeks. Thanks president trump! Anecdotal, period time normal first vaccine. suppose we’ll see second dose. 33 F relatively good health, reference.  Let’s fair, Americans learn fact whatever want government bail out?

That difference seems expanded Indian SA variants. 

Obviously still much better vaccinated though. talking about? Everything opening tomorrow also unvaccinated people. Even soccer stadiums. Nope. Biontech signed deal Chinese private company following government line. Biontech sign supply deal Taiwan unless Taiwan stops referring self country. Aka province Communist run China.

It's disgusting immoral. country gave world Covid happy watch another one die political reasons. I'm saying want recall succeed, I'll vote hold 15th date.

It's context. someone says ""enjoy traveling"" talking commute. provide link source Delhi excess mortality? please provide good link educate works?

Here link, 3-rd dose might suggested tackle Delta: Kappa entered chat room...     I'd like see clarification masks now. 

So he's said couple emails masks really work n95 masks. Hours late goes public tells people wear cloth masks. 

There sort simple answer here. surely wear cloth masks last year lies man, hope. Technically COVIX WHO, one 3 major partners participating COVAX program. Well wish could tell doses, insider tell us Canada news, looks like Moderna delays even Canada. EU production sites enough capacity Moderna vaccine produced US still ordered stay US government's order/guidance. think Moderna's contract Canada 20 + 36 option. Canadian know many delivered helpful. contract filled little bit, surprising Taiwan's 5 contract filled 150K.

Basically Taiwan government signed contract 2 local developers (Medigen Vaccine Biologics Corporation UBI Pharma Inc.) 10 million doses. 2 vaccines still Phase II trial. nobody really wants get vaccine without Phase III trial.

Some people complaining government buy much foreign vaccines betted heavily local vaccines. issue even April, time local virus transmission Taiwan local vaccines going deliver August. TV programs even talking left-over vaccines blame vaccines purchased. everything changed outbreak happened May. August feels like forever now. 

In opinion, government took gamble backfired. 200+ 300+ straight days local transmission, expect outbreak happen. Yes given Aus nearest neighbour fully aware quarantine problems, thanks educating though.
We agree disagree, hard believe hasn’t happened yet it’s going though. 
Truth better understanding disease guys beginning would better able cope unlikely outbreak occur, vast majority vaccinated high risk population density scattered it’s unlikely transmit way guys top one another highly unlikely scenario another community case True, know long-term effects online school isolation.

We can‘t forget there‘s life physical health. Everyone 12 older Congratulations single weirdest, wrongest, internet high horse I've seen days.  pretty major news stations UK Australia also calling shit. social media nonsense. 

These emails prove honest public lot things. 

Of course argument going science changes. could go science saying, even honest that. 

So credibility shot he's going attacked especially consider position.  variant evolved point evades vaccine, almost certainly incapable infecting humans cause little illness. fascination super-deadly vaccine-proof virus compatible viruses actually evolve. excited change words mean Meh, air travel still one main things requires masks regardless vaccination status. Crusty jugglers... recall. hope find man/woman job Literally 2 days anniversary Tiananmen Square Brazil moms job paying people cash got vaccine. They’ll liked require later on. hope right! least short term... Crossing fingers toes another India happen. understand vaccine situation different nobody knows yet whether enough. Positive wishes sidelines Canada. time I’ve sick since last January allergy flare fucked chest, yay asthma always making everything worse! I'm sure Canadian side US accept Canadian receipt pharmacist put sticker ""second dose"" slot CDC card, good Taiwan already turned vaccines Russia mainland. point I'd mad someone lived Taiwan amount received nowhere near amount offered others. NW Washington State cases secondary schools still record high. still many cases community. good news massive spikes overwhelmed hospitals. Thank Governor Inslee! looks plausible, fact intentional, purpose? would anyone intentionally release pathogen country, unvaccinated population — gain?

Nothing really. CCP probably care much lives individual Chinese citizens, there's point releasing pathogen country purpose spread adversaries.

Any major power wanted intentionally release infectious pathogen, would surely able smuggle target country release there. approach would many advantages letting loose country first.

I’d curious go ""how common false positive lateral flow test?”, learning chances positive result wrong approximately one 1,000. odds two false positives household day vanishingly small. Still, held hope. got sick last January don’t think covid, something nastier I’d *long* time.

Before mention article fact US taken control Pandemic, thanks Vaccines, sure point disputed ""conspiracy"" colleagues. last extended April 27th however indicated expires month extended know person got 50% unless mean first transparent? still data, weekly. one ever (should have) used single day's data decide anything anyway, what's difference here? talking now. up-to-date statistical information available issue.  It’s basically people vaccinated. Pay wall read entire article.  restrictions. They're actually using states emergency [make illegal. Miami-Herald article says seen actual proof helped get Whistleblower status. It’s disinformation physical proof happened. proof included article. corresponds lands historic Islamic caliphates (Umayyad, Abbasid, Fatimid, Ottoman caliphates, amongst others), rules large parts MENA thousand years. utter word salad starters, getting nasal swab even part vaccination process. know claim even is. D&amp;D group planning first in-person game year half two weekends now. Wow. That's rough. mean we're locked down. means capacity make rules. restrictions still falling 15th.   No. UK seeing growth 60% vaccinated first dose 40% vaccinated fully. may halt full reopening plans. Delta variant, also several states US. watch UK handle variant becomes dominant like there. man wonder good aew brought back crowds havent heard anything big cases rising watched islanders game tonight crowds looked normal LOL!!! We're one yet they're already worrying next??? Sorry posting clever name “callmemeh”. Hmmm seems pretty fishy coronavirus mutate quickly drastically something like influenza; new type vaccine work like others. Rather targeting one strain way flu virus vaccine triggers response piece virus called spike protein variants, I've read spike protein mutate way avoided vaccine, would actually stop working, able infect cells anyway. Seriously, US vaccinated, fine now. States offering million dollar lotteries get vaccinations. could've offered $1.67M lottery. read article vaccines made SII need significant amounts raw materials sourced US, hullaballoo weeks ago India huge wave infection US still restricting exports.

The Chinese vaccines apparently made domestic supply chain supply issue unlike India. Guess haven’t met ex. Covid disease started midwinter Central China last seen enjoying searing temperatures Delhi ripping largely unvaccinated population. add comforting statement bottom post, even discovering potential link myocarditis, Israel announced they’ll moving forward expanding access vaccines ages 12 starting week.

The risks Covid still seem much higher impossible it? possible heads spinning like top? Without something like vaccine passports, there's reliable way ensuring whether visitor vaccinated. already new report omits information. County level deaths, testing, cases schools, pediatric MIS-C data also omitted. Can’t open schools letting parents know actual data. close friend lives Florida said everyone town wore masks, restaurants followed CDC suggestions &amp; local public events. Whereas thats envisioned Florida. think state followed CDC protocol news covered.

On flip side know many California residents follow state guidelines. 

I think states big enough varied population kinda equaled out. make sense lol? data, neither authors. I'm saying weird authors data.

It seem that: know Covid Classic behaves respect kids; know Covid behaved last six months (surge dec-jan, followed rapid decline, followed another small surge, declining again). Given two above, able estimate many pediatric cases/hospitalizations expect Covid Classic. deviations expectation last six months, like significant increase, would sign p.1 impact.

I understand basis saying likely enough p.1 cases there. circulating 5 months now. Seems like enough time signal.  yes can, dumb thing complain recall folks complain whine everything anyways. heres example hypocrisy, days ago, governor texas extended state emergency texas, yet apparently hes tyrant despite ""laws"" lol look massive suffering, lives lost, lives destroyed covid doesn’t upset make want stop happening again, you’re sociopath. Yeah 20M 37M daily dose China, India finally gets shit together ramp up, they'll millions doses per day well. 

But poor highly populated nations global south able vaccinate rates. daily doses administered start falling winter China India start running people give shots to. average 500 Americans per day still dying COVID-19, almost unvaccinated.

Ugh. completely forgotten those, would’ve guessed happened least 3 years ago. different choice rather scarcity. visitor, like sales rep vendor tech, required masked.

Even they're vaccinated?? Yes, that’s true, couple things consider well:

1. Vaccinations occurring around half year, reference incidence full year. 11 per 100k could turn 22 per 100k end year. could less. That’s part connection hard prove — timescale short far.

2. 275 per 5 million entire vaccinated demographic. /u/Futureatwalker mentioned, break reference incidence observed incidence age, incidence higher.

It’ll good see CDC, EMA, Health Canada note start digging. Covid misspelled money. lets fucking goooooooo *Your achievement covid vaccine boosted knowledge genomics considerably*

**Genomics Tech Boosted** alone home year around people feels fucking SCARY statement Sinopharm could produce 5 billion doses year themselves, including 1 billion available export. I'm assuming ramped production produce RATE 5 billion year, actually make 5 billion doses 2021.

And also claims annual capacity 2 billion doses year.

I guess one might take claims grain salt, China good producing stuff quantity, think like Russia Sputnik production way targets. think China likely could produce doses 5 plus billion per year claim. interestingly, longest running state emergency thats still active one jimmy carter declared sanction iran, thats going 42 years now. comparison roosevelt one lasted 45 years Yeah shit. think it’s pretty naive believe we’d able beat another covid like disease one came. I’m sure we’d SLIGHTLY better knowledge gained (especially current generation(s) still around time), still total disaster eventually beat science instead responsible behavior. like one. know vaccinated? didn’t know first, surfaces aren’t significant source source transmission think toss gloves quarantine groceries.  wash hands usual. FWIW still wash cart handle though, things gross.

I concerned surfaces throughout could contaminated. denial free speech said neighbor put sign lawn. choice goes there. comment automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

There very, reasons children ever legitimately need places large numbers adults. kept away places higher risks transmission months. months ago. 

The reason UK holding back expanding younger anyone 40 UK second class citizen. can’t get vaccinated can’t maintain lockdowns. want rest us it? I’m board giving countries extra vaccines besides I’m lost. books lack proper research too: speak California. lockdown started, things closed restaurants could take grocery stores open. required write info entering store. closed beaches hiking trails weeks playgrounds caution tape around them. allowed leave house go wherever wanted open. Police around country refused enforce stay home orders mostly honor system. 

We started wear masks April think mandated May June. remember going dollar store May last year noticed employees wearing masks rare time. father brought one said, ""Yeah, really care."" Lo behold, couple weeks later, mandated forced care. first lockdown actually sort similar. stuff actually laws awful lot enforcement. Compliance high though. changed later lockdowns brought fines many people house, leaving 5 km non-essential reasons, wearing masks public transport, quarantining arriving abroad. Even enforcement relatively lax compared countries.

Shocking hear American police. /s like preventing private business hijacked would-be bioterrorists. Relevent xkcd : Oh... Twitter said was. death rate. Americans willing accept it. 

That's interesting thing. people suggests continue mask protect children, yet flu much higher death rate COVID-19 people 15 years age. 

I wonder people calling masks, remote learning, like every flu season.  different time internet existed? Free speech takes another hit. People spread misinformation time.

It company wish, though. even reliable system keep track births deaths, general. read one articles there's 74% coverage. But, mortality data closely reflecting reality big metro regions. seems like UK struggling can’t stop talking it. They’re special. Argie here. go look data number cases positivity rate understand shit show. read estimate saying actually 200k cases day 45M people country.

Our health system collapse already difficult get bed. Vaccination finally taken we're gonna feel effect vaccines later guess. I'm legit scared. 

Trying optimistic, already making Oxford Sputnik vaccines we're actually hoping become provider latin America. parents, aunts uncles already first doses. Also, parts country like Buenos Aires already peaked Well, I’m Massachusetts got Covid, you’re going convince model success. Contact tracers took 6 days got positive test result get touch me. That's solid independent country send vaccines to. decided it’s best protect likely seriously ill die rather likely symptomless UK variant already common US rates still dwindling. [Favorite country's Lol really clueless think countries access vaccines maintain lockdowns. Imagine unironically thinking this. problem order say want days need private company give platform. Removing someone Twitter Facebook essentially silencing completely. paying shit?? here, previous antibody tests negative. COVID positive tests point. Got vaccine. Boom, reactive notice.   Idk I’m opposed people wanting get vaccinated, feel like trusting science trusting you’re going die vaccinated. ability take work, would. Working fever sucks. Already has. friend planning travel US sister's wedding next week :( stay home orders basically recommendations. businesses qualified essential loose definitions never enforcement private gatherings rare exceptions. American police even wear masks let alone care enforce covid restrictions. they'll able end year, then, really easy keep kids away places large number adults. Children rarely actual need places adults congregate. Looks like 3 million Indians would die match U.S. deaths per capita. total deaths (virus + knock-on deaths).

India bit like Russia though reporting terrible real numbers huge guessing game. even U.S. official numbers 20% 50% undercount, based various estimates. Full vaccination AZ 10% effective preventing individual catching Indian variant. however give almost complete protection hospitalisation death. Pfizer 75% effective Moderna similar figure preventing individual catching Indian variant, also ~100% effective hospitalisation death Honestly one that's taking way hard. come someone misinformed first all, someone vaccine need social distancing wearing masks anymore, well, misinformed suggesting need one form natural immunity. 

Please inform yourself, stop dick. post seems like time capsule We’re talking circles here. I’m disputing that. original point rise cases due delta UK relatively recent, impact deaths TBD. 

I’m even saying increase hospitalizations deaths , can’t draw conclusions yet observe situation.  February low season anymore. People want nicer weather... plus staff lower lower hours parks even less people, doesn’t feel like it. ""good news"" post I'll upvote.  Say one dose makes 40% protected, new variants 40% contagious.... I, least, glad grandma’s still alive. like.. 6 million going Latin america Caribbean US do. senseless burden healthcare system. percentage porridge. Every time anyone tried point out, society basically stuck fingers ears said ""nyah nyah can't hear you!"" People horrified idea kids home 24/7 Yeah, schools returned fully ridiculous. never point closed, hospitality wasn't. think shows really messed set priorities business open, children's education thrown away. mantra government schools last close first open, lockdown ever happens. Incorrect. Vaccines designed intent preventing catching virus. However, offer cross board sterilising immunity. Most, like COVID vaccines, instead significantly reduce chance catching virus (eg Pfizer 90% fully protected catching Covid) remainder still catch fully vaccinated usually spread 50/50 completely asymptomatic mildly symptomatic cases. vaccine also reduces viral load (if you’re one 10% still catch virus) meaning significantly less likely pass infection another protected important people society, youth. 

I know UK care youth do. Again, rise cases corresponding rise serious symptoms deaths.  message demonstrably untrue consequences message severe, logical course action stop message. dozens articles impacts UK right now. example Yes it’s BS still waiting get appointment. even get one AZ. It’s NRW. Totally agree. Detroit incredibly left leaning city one lowest vaccination rates state. abysmal. know left leaning people seem adverse getting jab. course it’s even funnier “enforced it” past year 7 17 frickin rounding error, cause newfound panic. people hospital boob augmentation. U.S. drill WAY COVID discovered. drill called Crimson Contagion ran January 2019 August 2019... listen say reason Trump lifted ban creating deadly virus, like SARS even half country fully vaccinated, putting us nowhere near herd immunity. I'm 40 years old yet that's minimum age people called vaccine right now. EVEN eligible, I've already fuckton covid I'd rather see vaccine go someone running risk getting sick. please tell creepingly persistent problem me? Where's evidence ""Delta variant"" causing problems nations high vaccination rates?  I’m giving India much aid possible, prioritizing isn’t always best moral ground. focusing getting worlds healthcare system vaccinated first, elderly prevent deaths. 

I Brazilian friend quite upset aid India getting world largely ignored death disease Brazil. moral keep ignoring Brazil fully vaccinated India? new Delta variant India....it's become dominant short time looks least 40% transmissible compared Alpha (UK) variant. We've still got loads young people unvaccinated vaccines 30% effective 1 dose, lots people rip we're opening up. We've got 50% double dosed far. 

Oh Boris went scientists advice said kids didnt need masks schools weeks ago...big face palm opinion. Okay, might well never leave house again, lot things outside door riskier that. 

Living kind fear unhealthy. Looking back collective experience, one wildest things bad handle transmission coronavirus general, something we've dealing (both cousins making ""common cold""). 

We thought surface transmission driving spread. know if/what masks effective user error outweighed potential benefits. thought distance important instead ventilation. finally figured do, reduced spread COVID-19, crushed cold flu transmission well. 

That's kind crazy retrospect. Yes, confusion probably practical (masks needed certain places, ventilation fixes expensive floor stickers, DoorDash/Amazon make money, etc.). remember reading studies (ok, abstracts -- sue me). best scientific literature pretty scatter shot. kind took looking regions getting hammered working backwards. 

I dunno, seems like know lot less stuff unless trillions dollars line. Food thought. Months? Delta variant starting increase cases. Kids likely die drive grocery store car accidents contracting covid-19 fully vaccinated non mask wearing person store. acceptable take day work vaccinated? 
I’m currently experiencing headache fever chills can’t sleep astra zeneca vaccine. parents said Florida back school we're going. Factories contracts make nations fulfill local orders.

Welcome history India past 200 years. Famines home food shipped abroad. ""spreading falsehoods"" = lying

Not calling out, wondering problem media using words lying, liar? Maybe prove intent rather stupidity? 58 people hospital covid month ago, 116 now. 

7 day average new admissions end April 7. May 22nd, latest day average available, 17.

Hospital occupancy rising slower cases, falsehood say rising.

If want make claim like bring numbers. not? Please enlighten me. kids. really want kids vaccinated yesterday. know aren’t likely bad go dangerous childhood diseases there, want scratch covid lists. That's true... thing make ""certificate"" login Alberta Digital Health ID system online, vaccination record match photocopy type paper got. 😂 least way people can't cheat. he's talking new zealand. he's vietnamese least reason Texans. picked bad time go.

There excuse refusal point. mean, opinion piece lol India eventually exceed US death per capita? Vaccination centres never stopgap solution GPs take over. Thats guy whining local center 2nd doses missing point: wrapping up, go GP started regime now. idea CDC declare pandemic over? Yeah issue Taiwan also got control quite fast prepared ignoring CCP saying. trusted disease experts faired quite well. truth globally exposed pandemics plenty warning ready big pandemic. allowing China polictically control quite easy considering use appeasement get need China, miss members like Taiwan. understand knowing info would good, China still withheld information controlling spread disease. point information gain worth political effort takes get information, could followed Taiwans recommendations allowed WHO. noted opinion article, actual news. Surprised allowed sub.  Next week alone 6.5 million doses, enough vaccinate 10% adult population. Similar values week next couple months. nearly half population (total, ""impfberechtigt"" already dose.

God sick tired typical german complaining. COUNTRY There's whole lot bullshit going around... like idea exposure grant immunity, we'd need booster shots every year vaccines provide immunity variants.

So. Much. Bullshit. people screaming lift restrictions, another wave wipes humanity.

I'm done listening bullshit. I'm vaxxed, I'm going back normal life. maybe want hang ppl come realize ""toxic""? couple colleagues work relish spend vacation days extended family members fun around. past year actually respite since fight holiday travel crowd drive day spend time creepy uncles bipolar cousins, ""tradition"". Facebook said fake year ago, soo obviously racist misinformation /s  Hm. _try_?

I group 3, got appointment within 8 days state enabled group 3 people sheduled. Mit Verlaub, bullshit. Yes, kids 12 get vaccine eventually, hopefully soon. get vax yet? sister waiting since wont confident leave house either way info people cvid vax soon Well, conditions sale? Canada made deal China get bunch vaccines ended getting 0 from. think sides partisan struggle jerking us around different ways. see someone wearing mask assume extra cautious. see someone wearing mask, assume 50% chance actually vaccinated 50% chance denier never believed taken masks can.... especially stores still explicit mask policy... breaking rule breaking others. live, (75% still takeout-only) restaurants started allowing indoor dining weeks ago, still 25% capacity we're still social distancing. Govt offices still closed. Car dealerships appt only. post office allows 2 people lobby once.

It's bullshit believe lockdowns year. even parroted medical professionals. former general practice doctor told get vaccinated autoimmune disease take immunosuppressive medication it. said ""we know kind future complications may cause immunocompromised people"" ""your medication render ineffective anyway"" ""the safer option would avoid vaccination continue in-home isolation"". rheumatologist said that's nonsense. Even able discontinue medication temporarily vaccine, still enough immune system function safely effectively make use it. even though medication take render slightly less effective, it'll still effective enough definitely keep alive free severe illness breakthrough infection. primary care providers understand they're hearing reading misinterpreting it. People kind medical issue renders immunocompromised discuss specialists assume can't vaccinated vaccine effective them. backwards. Driving (a necessity many/most people), great example many, many things mitigate risk injury. 

Here's partial, off-the top head, list things prevent car injuries: 
seat belts; speed limits; stop signs; stop lights; speed bumps; car registration; licensing; eye tests; safety civil engineering roads; DUI's; checkpoints DUI's; insurance; insurance points; driver's education; recalls; airbags; enforcement like tickets; antilock breaks; crumple zones; age limits; air tires gas stations, squeegees gas stations; red light cameras; windshield wipers headlights; car seats young children; could go on.

We say ""well, there's risk everything, never mind things mitigate risk!"" would take pass 2 weeks clear 2nd shot (fully vaxxed up). take chance? like wedding funeral. plenty opportunities ""hang out"" throughout summer. pretending inform people instead telling harmed harm families

The old testament? quran hadith? get fucking vaccine. I'm obligation either. Well, studies show republicans less likely get vaccine. Unfortunately, vaccine rates fall along party lines.

e.g., read newer articles can't find right now. still like states highest vaccine rate one's Biden won. one lowest vaccine rate mostly Trump. apparently also relationship education. So, might uneducated vote Trump want get vaccinated.

But think poster meant pandemic badly handled politicized (wearing mask, meh freedom, COVID hoax, ""open country"") even vaccine created. Yep, go forever like Spanish flu H1N1 aka swine flu. ASTM rated surgical mask (they cheap, look them) cloth mask make good fit, closer 90%. danger different people 2 years ago? respect safety everyone opportunity get doses. vaccines widespread freely available like US, worry others worried enough bother getting vaccinated. someone cannot get vaccinated medical condition, point becomes responsibility ensure safe, might think wearing n95s limiting exposure public certainly public's problem go way ensure everyone else safe. That's way see it. Good. CCP going blow fuse too? article states GoF research increase lethality. true? thought also used increase infectivity. never said fully open. said things haven’t “lockdown”. Certainly nothing comparable spring 2020. 

I live major city tell little enforcement restaurant capacity stuff. walk past restaurant near house every day indoor dining packed since early April.

I’m sure got 15% gym capacity. state documents say 25%. haven’t gym recently, I’d surprised anyone actually enforcing that. 

The four counties red tier rural account like 1% state population.

Which school districts 3 hours in-person instruction per day? think state done get kids back school teachers got vaccinated, I’m seeing 3 hour guidance anywhere California public health documents. really like hostage taking ""saving lives"" point. US focused protecting bottom line pharma companies, monopolizing returns decades global scientific research mRNA vaccines, could everyone world vaccinated short order. demand done way preserves big pharma's stranglehold system global medicine producing continued, terrible harms. think people go Amazon find NHS website? think article missing point said, taking context. said “it’s soon say whether lift restrictions 21st June” 21st June soon. Pretty good acronym, though. N95 masks cheap widely available, protect people virus. may be. ground meant hospitals rest world knew expect got bad, also, important note difference total infections countries, Australia prime example, English speaking nation access info Europe America did, got virus control couple months occasional tiny flare ups since 100%. understand point saying matter COVID causes worse problems. want heads could happen need worry. Australia cluster 9 people Delta variant, cannot genetically linked anyone hotel quarantine system. Complete mystery, spreading fast, we’re 2% fully vaccinated. Gonna rough year. Fun fact could 2d projection curvature black hole. Similar 3D modeling program flat monitor. 

PS: commented share interesting science, I'm hard core flat earthers think cool real scientific possibility exists rarely used case counts positivity continue drop summer great protection high-filter masks (N95 equivalent) indoor public settings. Outside, long keep 6 feet distance, risk infection low. Sure, things like eating inside restaurant off-limits, still enjoy concerts, shows, amusement parks, fairs etc. CVID too! It’s huge bummer vaccine (and vaccines general) doesn’t produce meaningful levels antibodies. However, I’m back living normal life. It’s worth set aside life, job, spending time family friends indefinite period time. risk worth Yes, point date June 21st made complete return normality true, cases like still happen. Ok, dude.  Pfizer said last earnings call hope submit emergency authorization children 12 September. I'm hoping that's early enough school year head crazy new variant. I'm looking forward returning comic cons full glorious cosplay.  


I went casino week ago. money. That's funding comic con! fair, protecting flu much easier COVID last year's flu count shown - almost flu, still plenty COVID cases. So, protect COVID, likely catch flu. getting spot drug tests yearly COVAX initiative's failure direct result US policy around pharma IP, however. looking implementing open vaccine science technology transfer programs would've allowed everyone vaccinated start pandemic, less shut pressure major donor, Gates here's thing. Even people one group protected vaccine, mean might different others. Everyone can, get vaccine. chance works seems much higher chance doesn't.

Not mention people general population work well. Everyone physically vaccine injected body without dying allergic reaction get vaccine. Okay dont know much I’ve heard antibody tests natural infections more

I might wrong thats I’ve heard Well it’s opinion that. There's really way prove effective face masks are. know indeed effective mostly stopping spread preventing getting it. yeah right say that. issue administering though? 

why delay? Elementary schools going perfect petri dish new strain/variant. Yup. I'm Mexico. That's article said. bunch legitimate reasons could came lab (maybe brought bat lab run tests it).

Either way, we're going know everyone ""silenced"" CCP. playing devil's advocate, ""alternative"" would vaccine passport system Euro countries places like Israel NZ/Aus introducing. smaller countries try shield population community spread public settings introduction foreign outside variants much possible. Given cosmopolitan interconnected &amp; diffuse economy US would impossible establish kind highly regulated system, that's even addressing pushback libertarians. Banning sewage also answer.

Convincing people right thing poopoos fren.  understand biology well enough know whether claim merit. anyone defend debunk article? Uh dude.


Flatten Curve that.

Come on. Stop making stuff up. pandemic always reducing death hospitalization.

Also thanks totally ignoring hospitalization bit comment. Why? go American definition lockdown, probably are. weirdness r/sweden

Many posters claiming would lucky receive vaccine 2022. I'm, thirties, get second dose fairly soon. Regions people thirties standard. done adults want August. thing keeping going back full regular life fact kid can't get vaccinated yet. I'm still wearing mask set example prevent unlikely scenario become breakthrough case. talking USA Germany? Yes, think UK wins overall. US get loads vaccines manufactured got large proportion administered quickly, seemed chaotic, also seems case Germany. UK much organised ensured vulnerable groups done. can't find anything saying point still stands. still dishonest much information CCP giving acted like everything alright China control. still less effective allowing China active role, aims appease CCP maintaining independence China. demanding independent investigation start. Letting China year clean mess obvious appeasement hurt legitmency investigation. verify virus origins can't get access site tampering occurred? can't way CCP therefore faced massive pushback western nations, including big sanctions. 
 I'm removing title may mistranslated article may changed. either case, post title match content article.

No, AZ vaccine effective South African variant. Saying vaccine effective variant anti vax thing all. want get vaccinated sooner want Pfizer's. doubt article says, bit like saying ""The pandemic California!"" It... still going world. Pandemic mean disease infiltrating entire country, one infected whole world, word think appropriate. 

""We eliminated Covid Norway!"" sure.

""We eradicated Covid Norway!"", probably not.

""The pandemic over, Norway!"", overly sensational optimistic. *layman Alright. Well changes let us know. aren’t keeping USA locked another year, data currently suggests Covid non factor demographic. cannot find source,(Sorry,I think Asahi Shinbun,Japanese paywall)
Tokyo problem Shinjuku ward,(Kabukicho)Where night time entertainment industry really big.

Shinjuku ward get crafty.They decided vaccinate people 20's 30's (before 40's 50's)after vaccinate people pre-existing condition,to prevent spreading entertainment industry.

Here's hoping situation Taiwan improve soon! check CDC variants page look mutations. seems converging around E484K/Q mutations. Let’s hope Exactly.

I don’t disagree PGA’s decision, I’m sure going case study important vaccination is..in fact, kinda supports counter-arguement COVID isn’t scary someone leading physically mentally challenging competition infected. According article people believe conspiracy theories:

\- believe benefit conspiracy theory

\- want feel smart

\- may different moral compass  Sadly though, still give kids 12 eligible vaccines. could always incubate new variant get infected. Ya unvaccinated suffer most, innocents suffer also. number doses administered per capita Canada Germany [pretty much main difference amount time two doses, that's Germany 21% fully vaccinated Canada ~7%. family still afraid of. cannot wait vaccines 12. kid first line. wonder many threads country extremely well whole pandemic worse moment, yet still way better most. Meanwhile single thread Colombia Argentina, countries recently really deadly waves. thing unvaccinated subgroups virus still spread, cause outbreaks kill people.

I think anyone right provide reservoir virus. I've seen articles studies point ""An analysis electronic medical records California found 32 percent started asymptomatic infections reported troubling aftereffects weeks months later."" NY Times. I'm friend, buddy. Yes, can. Here, India, know people even hospitalised despite getting first dose, older couple got mild symptomatic infection two weeks second dose. got better week though. close reaching light end 2 week tunnel went hardware store yesterday 90% people maskless. state 30% adults vaccinated. hope people keep fucking rest us. woke up. I'm running 38 C fever. Expected guess. Japan delivered Taiwan 1.24 million doses AstraZeneca 's coronavirus vaccine Friday free, gesture double amount shots island received date I'm not, stop assuming world circles around doorstep   general, ""if employer mandates employee receive vaccine order work premises employee sort severe reaction vaccine, causing serious illness injury, employee could entitled workers' compensation benefits,""  8 weeks BC.

I’ve on-off fever, headache, fatigue I’ve partially lost sense smell

Despite mother one dose, still potentially get sick mind boggling. #winning Although specifically people hesitating. rest us who’ve vaccinated couple months also didn’t get rewards (except extent terrible person reward) :( think you’re right unfortunately :/ wait vaccines guess India disagrees.  don’t know man, hate “invincibility” excuse. never felt invincible. I’m 25 jumped vaccine. think feeling you’re invincible interchangeable stupidity - excuses age group. need more. already have. legally thougj questionable.

lawyers certainly argue danger passed judges may rule favor. walking 5 miles day, heat, leading competition requires tremendous physical skill mental focus. don’t think positive test means sick (yet). It’s difficult call someone ill symptoms (at point) leading professional golf tournament.

However, guess bacterial pandemic happen nowadays particular bacteria would ways spread without stopped antibiotics right? wife went dinner weeks back birthday vaccinated plus two weeks. Felt odd room many people masks. former president’s adviser, Dr. Brix, stated first 100,000 deaths probably unavoidable. that, blame lies Trump administration.

“It’ll gone Easter…like miracle…”  Wasn’t Black Plague caused bacteria? 11Bn vaccinations left delivered, done ASAP. Correct vaccine passports, although also disagree point- essentially zero US tourists, could allow fully vaccinated pass PCR test country significant risk? 
As shear numbers, always stated base green/amber/red status vaccination rates well 7-day average new cases/100,000. think US qualify green soon, UK slow update list. imagine change amber green June (and hope going US June, returning UK July) 🤞 Problem people lie vaccinated. people would pay hundreds euros forged vaccination test certificates instead getting free vaccine. There's two state elections last year Australia New Zealand one too. That's pretty piss poor dictatorship. Yup. Rebekah Jones scientist question.

IIRC, reporting agencies counting test positives negatives differently way biases towards lower positivity rate. can't say they're islands nothing control borders. basically Ned Flanders ""We've done nothing still working!""  Obesity? MRNA actually really good platform flu vaccines, might possible make vaccine works strains instead guess dominant strains year are. pans out, older flu vaccines might eventually get discontinued. That's german government, successful first lockdown beginning, fucked every single thing possible afterwards.

Seems story much developed west, sadly.

* Government reacts pandemic cases rising effective restrictions sufficient enforcement thereof.
* Previous measures result case rates declining.
* Declining case rates result politicians tripping end restrictions.
* Ending restrictions causes cases rise.
* But, public tasted restrictions, there's political properly reinstate restrictions, shrug let things happen and/or re-implement restrictions half-assed basically enforcement.

It's story saw across west varying forms. US could even see across individual states. top head California great initial reaction, Newsom rushed relax restrictions state recover vaccines became available. watched case counts drop dramatically Memorial Day - ONE reported Florida report case numbers 3 days. Turns out, almost 6000 new cases Memorial Day weekend added nation's total. 

Each day still averaging 2000 - 2500 cases per day - they've decided report week. numbers even accurate - state underreporting since pandemic began.

So, highest number daily cases nation added total - wonder overall total down. sure....things better. Yeah, effect same, quickly develop vaccines emerging diseases

That might legally shoot someone who's property state... Ah fuck, get job now? really. main “enemy” new Cold War framing China, controlled pandemic far effectively US every way. problems pandemic essentially ones collective action, China unilaterally outperforms US citizenry. It’s also poor countries like Vietnam diminishingly deaths COVID compared US, even though average citizen far, far poorer. China already vaccines mostly effective anyway mRNA technology also either stolen state intelligence services otherwise replicated within couple years. Lol super exciting seeing mRNA vaccines came months ago, able slap covid hardcore.

Then seeing drug companies trying target diseases like malaria even cancer tech! like Star Trek medicine except real. cat cannot put back bag either. eye opening couple years. CDC already denounced 70% vaccination rate needed herd immunity. 80 90 new threshold. Per Fauci likely 90. health doctors aware one saying vaccines stop transmission amount reduce negligible.

You know ""precise amount reduction transmission"" way, shape form. There's clear evidence significant reductions start scientists claiming reduction transmission vaccine studies looked - whether people tested positive. Since vaccines used (and there's two billion administered) there's many studies looking transmission among things. due respect, saying reduction transmission negligible *now* clueless. one else posted article subreddit? Also FDA signs on, goes main argument requiring vaccination things like school travel. tampa area. confirm area people wore masks went cdc guidelines part. 

Theres people mask nose people standing close, honestly could alot worse. company work still requires us wear masks talking customers keeping distance ( large pest control company) required follow rules pretty much got point stay around home entire time got vaccinated.

I see still wearing mask least flu season. first winter decades get horrible ill! Asian countries right idea mask wearing.  please tell beer drinking trucking driving buddies get vaccinated.

The way see live attenuated vaccines provide closest thing natural immunity use weakened form virus create real infection. preferable mimic body's natural immune response close possible? 
Also understand immune response live attenuated vaccines robust, creating mucosal systemic antibodies T-cell response typically lasts rest life. (I'm educated medical field might wrong.) 
Also, understand common vaccines everyone gets live attenuated vaccines measles, mumps, rubella, polio, flu. 
It seems live attenuated vaccine sure shot end pandemic. So, gives? one obscure company developing one? Everywhere else still requires mask. stand next infected person, snort snotty nose cuz allergies, sneeze another unvaccinated person, yeah, spread it. they're actively replicating virus extent unvaccinated person would be. Nope. anything. Well, maybe forest fire. hurricane. link original study: widely reported Indian media. articles India sensational, take pinch salt want to.  addition vaccinated, also certain percentage people Covid natural immunity.

Please leave comment on, others misunderstanding know it. whole thread predicated saying masking social distancing wouldn’t work alone. avoided people (i.e., social distanced) would reduced spread, cases entirely. don’t think thread aligns originally postulating. sub comments basically saying, “They don’t work entirely around family friends, strangers.” key word “around”. Don’t around can’t communicate disease. doesn’t mean don’t see ever, even walk park winter day slight hardship ensure everyone’s health. even depends hour day since amazon category shows bought items last hour... Best figure we'll need 83% people immune COVID functionally gone like measles. Thats 83% vaccinated, thats 83% **immune**. 

The vaccines average effectiveness 80% so, counting JnJ variants. 

So, go away like Measles masks social distancing, we'll need 83/0.80=103% people vaccinated... Wait work...

So boosters, come. Jayson Tatum 23 yr old NBA star needed inhaler months getting COVID. would much rather get vaccinated feel crummy couple days stand corrected Game. Blouses. sell things people buy them

Not people would buy them. got suggested conspiracy book amazon I'm cult. equation changed, though. Early pandemic, Canada's mere mask social distancing meant [per capita case death rates something like half US, less, 2020, especially summer reason got bad Canada recent months arrival transmissible variants, effect blunted US widespread deployment vaccines point, whereas Canada (back Feb. March) well behind US vaccinations due inadequate availability. So, US started pulling ahead Canada terms performance several metrics spring.

These issues complicated assess, bottom line, US done Canada early pandemic, could saved least couple hundred thousand lives. Canada access vaccines like US back start 2021, ""third wave"" Canada could better contained. Different strategies, different outcomes, depends look it.

You fundamentally right takes masks social distancing get rid it, simple techniques greatly diminish it. Unfortunately US became political issue led poor performance overall compared many countries. Yeah spending time cover opposed work global level, identify prevent happening (going fwd) key success. like kid hiding adult magazine mattress parents finding it. Ge might deny blame kid brother, happen again? Sure finger pointing denial go along it.
Government officials interested 2 things money power. might promise whatever want hear, end nothing minion. strain somehow able reinfect vaccinated people high rate also managed cause serious illness level similar COVID19 initially emerged, see response federal government/CDC pretty quickly augment behavior then. 

I'm sure say that's literally impossible, *incredibly unlikely*. Dingbrain1 right track comments. variants played up, basically impacted vaccinated individuals (especially vaccinated vaccines approved USA) really all. look, probably 98% wearing face masks properly, almost Journalists reporting News certainly aren't.

THIS worries me.

Even lockdowns Qld work, people definitely social-distancing, partner 2 people did, still do.

Dr. Jeanette Young advised everybody inside workplace last lockdown wear face mask social-distance next 2 weeks. 

NOBODY work (except partner I) did.

THAT scares me. shouldn’t hearing ""wait two weeks!"" thing months. Infections started going Scotland 4 weeks ago. 4 weeks long enough seen spike hospitalizations deaths going happen.

You're honest. N F L N  worked person workplace heavy covid spread cloth mask survived well vaccination. feel like cloth mask pretty damn effective.

I likely exposed times week, daily mean governments time every day.

I know fun get soapbox say human life priceless that's pretty obviously case Wow model accurate.  Well are, well, far guess. suggesting possible, Cholera would still big problem every country. call Indian variant people understand.

All us India already knew this.....Our second wave fueled this. unvaccinated specifically request level respect customers? That’s one disorder. Think others. everything black white. people shouldn’t get vaccine.

People pushing vaccine hard aren’t taking account people aren’t able get it. Also effects lives. 

P.S. 3 million population Chicago. may small 7 billion planet it’s small number. see mean. hope June 15 thing really opens things businesses. idea schools limiting person instruction point. People free say largely want however don’t confuse private company needing give platform. immediate area 80% vaccinated I’m guessing won’t issue anymore. healthcare education hub early access vaccines rural/suburban areas (i.e. SF allotted doses meant San Mateo Marin counties intentional people Marin could drive Moscone Center

I 't understand this. Could put vaccination sites San Mateo Marin counties? expected people travel way Moscone Center? No, actually tell hot harm people. community spread still high are, wear mask store, etc. forever wear masks could get sick?

No. enough people vaccinated, community spread levels plummet safe even unvaccinated people point. way vaccines protect us, instead direct protection.  would rather risk chance death stay locked house three months straight again. I’ve lived risk since ten discovered uncle dropped dead working out. limited medications follow diet risk doesn’t increase already is. 

All I’m saying people need think people want vaccine can’t get it. It’s lot individuals understand. Ive told like, “oh no, that’s vaccine, can’t be—what you, antivax?! much time Facebook?” It’s crazy. may side effects people doesn’t mean vaccine dangerous

That’s part really pisses off. Obviously I’m antivaxxer—would fully vaccinated were??? 

There’s loads things disrupt woman’s cycle—some benign *not*. frustrated told couldn’t possibly (temporary! Again, anti-vaxxer) vaccine side effect since left far concerning possibilities table. That's pretty much I'm at. I've played rules well year, I'm vaccinated, want get back regular life. I've done part help protect can't vaccinated, simply refuse vaccine point Wales anyone 18+ eligible :) peoples feeling hurt “fat shaming”  We’ll wait see. Hospitalizations deaths lagging indicators higher ups secretaries screen emails importance, certain terms senders flagged “more important” Certificate paper misleading, it’s like high school photocopy matters cuz US large stockpiles JJ AZ vaccines made Emergent Biosolutions contaminated several batches received FDA approval. stockpile possible can't even used right away potentially never. declare anything want. welcome agree it, not. great day. Kent Yes revised said masks. still proves point right plan set decade ago like claimed. countries strategic, democratic allies (read: pawns potential military conflict China). Oops! assume meant “China”. Heh! blood tests Red Cross *might* confirm worked. Essentially:

* Negative result means detect antibodies. means recently infected COVID, really says nothing vaccines. *many* different antibodies, ones might gotten vaccine might one testing for. Or, might detectable level, still protected immune mechanisms Red Cross testing for.
* Positive result means detect antibodies, may either recent infection vaccine. course cannot tell which, least testing equipment. infection may even got vaccinated.

This Red Cross stresses antibody tests **do not** say anything vaccination: results muddy. good case, idea infected point, results essentially meaningless. But, got vaccine, vast majority cases, works. worth checking.

But still great donate blood, please that.

----

That said, bit hypocrite. donate blood regularly anyways, using antibody test see see sort antibody pickup. thing is, comparison: donated blood getting vaccinated negative antibodies, since fully vaccinated donated blood again. student, getting regularly tested COVID (all negative course), know fact blood donations. still waiting test results, know certain way would antibodies would vaccine. test negative still, whatever, vaccine worked anyways, can't see it.

But overall special case, donate blood anyways! substitute viral disease “flu” above. fewer cases around, lower risk. flu covid US winter, thanks vaccines. NHS CDC wrong (and even flat lying) 'good cause' bunch times.

So see gain pointing lying bureaucrat's (who never held accountable) banners.

It's ridiculous banners pop everywhere, half time following organisation's advice exact opposite doing. put cost human life?
How put cost freedom? Things like get repeated time, people accept fact, they're complete misrepresentation truth.

By global standards, US far l\*ft issues far r\*ght others. legal weed (in many states), g\*y m\*rriage, affirm\*tive action general popular culture idp\*l representation non-traditional sexu\*lity absolutely massive. also low taxes, universal health care economic system generally tends favour rich poor.

In lot ways, opposite countries like Cuba China.

Incidentally, really interesting (and frustrating) see posts taken political post bot ad ones aren't. Tawain also major producer global supply semiconductors . Ironic literally entire universe know created random chance (unless course prefer creationist point view) reason impossible virus mutated randomly. 

Interesting point view :) get fucking vaccine.

Not everyone even do, guarantee it'll work. Anti-flu vaccine great anti-covid19 vaccines are. Also, refusing wear mask knowingly infected exactly driving knowingly drunk : asshole. recent post, argued “vaccinated people’s urine/feces”(sic) needed separated general sewage supplies/waterways impact unvaccinated people via drinking water established.

Good lmfao. What’s even worse people eat stuff actually believe it.   Wow empathy level zero. wish normally healthy child could cavalier risk are. daughter preexisting heart kidney issues makes high risk getting severe case virus. Plus, less 30% people county vaccinated. Everywhere goes people threat possibly getting sick. outdoor activities places adequate ventilation. 

This meant saying we're taking anywhere. go grocery store, restaurants anywhere indoors. Good. She's... ok.  Yeah anyone 4 working braincells saw coming last year. That's true, let's hope gets better adorn symbol around necks business owners spot soon see them. Yeah I’m seeing enough coverage elsewhere  That's absolutely disgusting, remove testing requirement fully vaccinated individuals. 

This something significant impact economy, yet little health benefits Weird comparison, we're #15 per capita. probably since India billion people N95 works get virus yourself, cloth masks helps transmit virus. simplified terms. like paying it? US prepare either. bought way this. Indeed. places it’s still damn expensive. point it’s generally getting easier, cheaper accessible. 100€ per PCR 2 tests either lie doctor got symptoms pay 200€. That's 30% whole holiday bill, issue lot people. Every one JUSDs county three hours less person learning. know it’s way every county every county affects us. 

I understand California isn’t complete lockdown, many small business owners still feeling it’s locked capacity limits. Maybe local health officials aren’t checking…I don’t know sure. guess point post argue want call things…lockdown restrictions, make point many business owners staff still feeling handcuffed restrictions. One hope masks ""work"" extent, guidance Fauci/CDC beginning idiotic. cloth mask going protect extended, close-contact exposure, might protect passing someone grocery store. N95 protect probably 90% least, even close contact situations worn properly P-100 protect 100% worn properly.

Literally, could ramped N-95 P-100 production sent everyone wear month two, shit would over. think that's possible. Viruses rarely go away, given transmissible one is, won't. We'll learn live it. No. pointing US points CDC, UK point equivalent.

I think anti vax book changes minds, time buying books minds already made-up. I'm saying obsess it. I'm simply saying present actual data without exaggeration. There's nothing obsessed about, vaccines work well essentially make covid non-issue. matter fact, work well understand would exaggerate even fraction percentage.

The bottom line is, conspiracy theorists deniers already think we're lying, want give even slightest bit ammunition. No. New cases thing rising. Deaths hospitalizations remain flat. would probably never know condition sale happen.

I thought CanSino agreement Canadian research institute joint development clinical trial Canada Ad5-nCOV vaccine candidate. cancelled vaccine candidate seed never made Canada, possibly political relation deterioration. joint development initiative purchase agreement? Unless news missed.

And stupid idea Chinese side. trial happened everything worked out, CanSino could gain much market share influence earlier trial timeframe. still stuck Phase III trial last time saw news.

Wasn’t assumption disproven year ago ?  Educated people tend believe science vote left. Nothing new. 100% expected. There's peer-reviewed proof works serious illness death.

If works, works.

Also, Western vaccines hoarded rich countries anyway. SEA, large shipments affordable Sinovac vaccines, pandemic would lot worse us. little 50% effectness...

I agree situation unfair younger people. Also, trust me, frustrated. year studying London got cut half due Covid instead, sitting home whole day trying work Ph.D. which, admittedly, going well, University libraries still largely closed bookable time slots one discuss chat with. 

However, think taking away rights older people received vaccines everyone chance solution here. young people hit hardest restrictions, mean people also suffer, literally reason anymore them. Vaccinated people save lives stay home, infection rates noticeably lower vaccinated required stay home - important difference.

I know vaccinating younger people earlier solution. least think given better consideration since infections young age groups well. also think older generation owes younger protecting lives. instead older generation suffer really benefit anyone, measures specifically benefit young people payments, travel/restaurant/clubbing vouchers, etc. hardly make past year, would least show goodwill. Also, imo allowed rely negative PCR test least 5 days testing week would sufficient.

Hopefully, low infection rates currently, restrictions lifted soon anyways. Museums, exhibitions,etc already reopen. Indoor dining allowed starting 9th June.

Currently expected still limited summer gathering 1,000 people. (meaning show negative PCR test enter).

Hope honeymoon work you, probably good year visit since tourist back yet 2021, likely less crowded usual. would prevented positive tests require testing players vaccinated.

It’s simple screwed it’s time actually steps mistake. need incompetent leaders. expect more. company would fired CEO now. ""on off"" much might think though. parts Australia lockdown free many many months, zero cases. Melbourne, international arrivals therefore incoming cases are, lockdown months one. also significantly sustainable lockdown 2 weeks cases run course every months let run wild stay open. Pretty much everything open w/ limitations. Restaurants still allow outdoor dining time dance clubs closed. museums tourist attractions open, many limited capacity require booking time slots advance. don’t think realize mental toll virus people nursing homes. weren’t able see family visitors many months time. physical therapy still able walk lost ability forever. didn’t anything one talk mental capacity also declined like crazy. nursing homes every resident come main room lunch dinner served individual rooms. literally social interaction.

I’m really glad uk doesn’t really antivaxers. We’ve already got 75% adults who’ve first jab still haven’t even offered everyone first jab yet. really trust Flordia, auspicious. random mutation absence selection pressure that, random mutation. Random mutations inevitable due way reproduction occurs, trying needed. random mutation confers reproduction advantage context selection pressure evolution. Certainly human immune system viruses evolved alongside other. environment virus changes impact mutations confer advantage. told people stop getting tested got vaccine, they're shocked positive tests go down? asymptomatic replicating chance mutation. seems intentionally stupid. I’m you. Considering pandemic, weekly reports seem like better use resources.  2 shots per person 2 shots per person It’s almost exclusively effecting unvaccinated. Something like 70%. Anytime vulnerable hosts virus circulating efficiently. important metrics deaths hospitalization think move toward vaccinated you’ll see case count become less relevant. said assume rise cases US among unvaccinated cohort inevitable. like said, UK “Surge” rise US come close rivaling previous surges. Well find article different conclusions

[And still, California better controlled virus. California Florida’s death rate, roughly 6,000 Californians would dead tens thousands additional patients likely would landed already overburdened hospitals. Florida California’s death rate, roughly 3,000 fewer Floridians would dead COVID-19

...

About 55% California residents live counties high “social vulnerability” score — measure severely disease outbreak might affect region — quarter Floridians do. California’s rate overcrowding homes, metric linked coronavirus spread, also double Florida’s.

...

California also longer flu pneumonia season, pattern coronavirus tends follow, Mokdad said. fall, may extra-contagious strain virus circulating locally complicated matters.

Because many ways California susceptible coronavirus spread, replicating Florida’s relaxed approach may devastating consequences here. Arizona, lax restrictions similar Florida’s, nation’s fifth-highest COVID-19 death rate. additional 38,000 Californians would dead state’s per-capita deaths matched Arizona’s.

...

If L.A. County’s deaths subtracted California’s total, Florida’s death rate would measure 39% higher state’s. L.A.’s vulnerabilities drove California’s surges pushed total death rates close Florida’s. Wow like country Earth? Nothing. People refuse accept heading back normality. would imagine part publish process verification step. Make sure obviously bad data releasing public. Definitely not, could misconstrued geographic descriptor. ""younger, **more progressive**"" translate GOP?

I dont think Gavin progressive *enough*. think entire country right shifted though centrist appears progressive. think hard say. seen winter restrictions yet. know many kids vaccinated. Wait MENA Middle East North Africa? I've never seen acronym kids ever survive years deadlier flu age group Khalifa al Manea, Bahrain’s undersecretary health, said vaccine manufactured state-owned Chinese drugmaker Sinopharm, accounted 60% Bahrain’s inoculations far, providing high degree protection. 90% people hospitalized current Covid-19 wave, worst country faced, hadn’t vaccinated, said.

As wrote Khalifa al Manea, Bahrain’s undersecretary health, said vaccine manufactured state-owned Chinese drugmaker Sinopharm, accounted 60% Bahrain’s inoculations far, providing high degree protection. 90% people hospitalized current Covid-19 wave, worst country faced, hadn’t vaccinated, said.*

Tyranny. Probably problem know precise amount reduction transmission vaccine causes husband professor doctor public health. reduction comes premise you’re vaccinated, you’re less likely get sick enough cough sneeze people theoretically vaccination could prevent transmission infinitesimal amount you
can still contract virus carried peoples breath singing, shouting otherwise breathing close you. Public health doctors aware one saying vaccines stop transmission amount reduce negligible. surge happen people mostly vaccinated. Zero sympathy someone every opportunity get vaccinated chose to. guess know votes fucked reasons. would wear masks social distance often covid? Cases extremely low able respond them. There's reason things community transmission covid.  Many provinces planning roll back restrictions well folks opportunity second dose. BC many folks taking optimistic returning-to-normal plan province announced mean “no masks July 1 whee! NORMAL SUMMER!” though fully vaccinated then. That's precisely warned us going holidays happened exactly warned. People drop guard around family go without mask social distancing. gutted? really don’t understand. Weren’t 0 cases pandemic? Next time, let's deranged, moron, lazy, lunatic charge might help. Pandemic waves huge nationwide monsters. think see flare-ups effectively talking albeit maybe multi-state regional level, makes sense. hope I'm wrong vaccine rates way current predictions I'm entirely hopeful. LETS F@#KING GOOOOOOOO!!!!!! Great you!! love it! young children immunocompromised/ vulnerable vaccination wildly different experience summer. I'm happy get whatever want. IS, *after all*, ""American Way"", apparently! Enjoy worry free summer! ...bitches still shiver think things godsend. bad stuff happened seeing something positive makes feel like stole one acceptable timelines another stuck vacineless 2021 lmao posting NJ update today. reason 800 first dose shots today’s report can’t right given 7 day average 17,000 something messed up. media writes whatever shit get away get clicks. want pandemic end, money printer scare mongering. Every time government blinks eye, use excuse write new article. Journalism covid low quality. One day post one thing, next post opposite, drew visitors. Hopefully follow 100 year trend .. even hopefully never happen again.. Old people already got vaccine Yep, Argentina still going strong entered june means winter going knocking doors extra cases pretty soon.

Vaccination per day rising last week though, government absolute shitshow dealing Pfizer seem grabbed Sputnik vaccine pretty darn well (first national production center opening soon!). However dont expect us reach point December. vaccines shown effective them. antibodies sure swell job protecting getting  1 2 months unvaccinated population minority. Vast minority.”

Talk things haven’t aged well, it’s two months we’re 41.6% fully vaccinated we’ve stopped wearing masks. state get beer really hope joking/being satirical... Saying ""we've war Covid"" bring idiots woodwork set us back. Like right now. Here. discussion. went brunch last week first time year. Saw eldest first time year yesterday. We're getting world back. :D

Yes. Get pancakes!!! (unless live somewhere full antivax nincompoops, case, drive somewhere better eat pancakes there) Absolutely shocking many people couldn’t figure proper mask fit year pandemic. Husband told 2024. he’s basically broken able go home, I’m reporting said. Reading lines certainly appears vaccinated. moron haha lot public health motivating people should. There's lot people super opposed vaccine high enough perceived risk covid bother getting shot risk needing take day two work deal side effects. small incentive provide incentive need get done.   Yes, let’s ignore facts figures. Dipshit free. righteous understand people skeptical rushed “vaccine” Get help get here

Trolls everything try project onto Biden things know Trump guilty of. Imagine simple That's great! One nephews got J&amp;J shot months ago fine. Would nice people state would take it. broken 30% fully vaccinated yet... thought announced mid 2022 border opening?  anyone seriously interested sort thing (really interested, small percentage us), highly highly highly recommend Laurie Garrett’s “The Coming Plague: Newly Emerging Diseases World Balance”. 

The first part book fascinating detective story Ebola, Marburg, Lassa, Machupo, several emergent zoonotic diseases, cowboy researchers scientists health professionals dealt outbreaks - efforts largely led significantly facilitated CDC. 

The last part book details longer capability more. 

The book published 1994.  Every vaccine modification (including changing dosage 2 3 shots) must clinical trial.

The 2 shot version already phase 3 done multiple countries understanding PGA require vaccinated individuals test anymore. mean aced competition vaccinating? inb4 fad eliminate ions diet. fact posting covid data 1-2 weeks actual current report, recent report, would like disagree Florida Democrat People working mRNA flu vaccine hopefully work every year's flu, instead guess dominant strain make strain-specific shot year.

But comes fruition, expect they'll stay current tried true method that's tested years manufacturers used to. seen anyone anywhere saying second doses necessary. Bring beer take picture Ok Want pancakes? Agreed x1000. talking about? know baby went ICU intubated. parents hospitalized ICU . Haven’t received news. I'm surprised Oh see. That’s bad I’m sorry hear she’s going that. know hard condition see work considering many need second vaccine month. vaccinations happened may. due second shot. BioNtech deliveries down. AZ used second shot many. BNT make that. Many places first shots right not. look reality ground around me. many people know get appointment without trying day, it’s going well let believe.

And lots still go wrong. Right. also remember US never really locked first shutdown, places like Ontario, specifically Toronto, lockdown 300 days. 

But regardless, that’s arguing. person said US could’ve “won” COVID months ago people worn masks practiced social distancing, I’m pointing even places things, wasn’t even enough keep manageable levels. little late respond. clinical informatics person (the Epic person) would give specific statistics. confirm covid+ person admitted unit, approx 25% mortality, intubated point, approx 40%mortality.

So yes, one acknowledge existence covid 'believe' risks low, us paying attention reality past 18 months, know risk low. know watching respiratory failure person awful sometimes avoidable. know largest mass-death event generation. know massive dysinformation campaign warped skewed US perception understanding reality global pandemic. know crossed 600,000 confirmed deaths states. someone type 1 Diabetes group people vaccine doesn’t work well, certain types immune disorders?

My younger brother type 1 Diabetic he's vaccinated. lives Sweden I'm sure jab got imagine safe. Meh, guys Taiwan (China) vaccines, manufacturers (more less) giving fair deal. Meanwhile, home country, manufacturers making serious demands cannot fully satisfy. Hell, cannot even negotiate. know companies (the head anti-pandemic task force give explicit name), certainly suspicion. 

Still, good luck fight pandemic. hope APAC region still peaceful next 10 years. individual isn’t really looking answer.

He keeps asking same, panicked questions (where answers readily available) again. He’s extremely paranoid. I’d avoid responding him. supply issue Japan. tens hundreds millions doses Pfizer Moderna freezers way.

Administering doses real bottleneck.

Plus government decided authorize Astrazeneca local use, ordered (and producing locally) hundreds millions doses need. made UK Pfizer mostly made US, Germany Belgium. Moderna Switzerland (i think) Spain

Uk produces Astrazeneca shots Well it’s cnbc he’s obviously mentioned  general I’m impressed. think it, one 2 adult street already partial immunity (well less take vaccine efficiency rate etc), meaning likely get mild symptomatic covid case any. one 4 extremely unlikely catch all. That’s pretty encouraging. wouldn’t agree two necessarily mutually exclusive might well use saving lives countries advantage another covid case. 2nd one week lifted mask mandate state. Chile? Haha Stop spreading misinformation ignorant fuck, chinese vaccines might effective stopping virus spreading RNA ones, they're still effective preventing severe cases death. main objective.

Damn, sub full ignorant, privileged elitists. Lol dude keep posting same, panicked comments every time.

Yes it’s safe meet someone who’s full vaccinated. type 1 diabetes plays role immune response vaccine. information easily accessible, clam down. honestly think Americans seemed uncaring times

There’s much sense community different parts country. People northeast don’t really ever give thought what’s going Texas Airzona. They’re thousands miles away. might well foreign country it’s completely irrelevant well aware big Dons many inadequacies point. journal Fauci yet misdemeanours ignored.
Congrats getting vaccine. That’s definitely worth putting flare hahah FWIW, friend 3rd party kidney gets 2x shots vax.

(with doctor's permission). went Africa (you need 4-6 shots).. got 2x.

&amp;#x200B;

Pfizer trigger great response. antibodies full course Moderna. “Not another variant!” Another reason locked even vaccinations. We've already accepted 3000+ deaths day. Nearly half country going last year like there's pandemic. find amount general tests took place day weekly base? public display? Preferably ordered country. Thanks advance! getting downvoted that's legitimately is.

The people high social ladder ability get AZ shots weeks turning favor waiting Pfizer/Moderna/J&amp;J

The normal people willing take vaccine all, AZ's distributed properly


Source: Taiwanese American Goodbye. Trump President time mentioned article, sure you’re trying paint things though he’s irrelevant weird people mentioning. Thank Everyone’s employee somewhere Good example lot family took personal responsibility, keep grandmother, 90s, safe. coming across pretty nasty. get grieving realistically asking guy do? Stay inside forever lower risk death zero? Man work healthcare nurse think comparing war reallllllllly downplays war. Like sucked times still worked 3 days week, getting paid it. shift would clock go sleep bed days worked.

Only people knew working way normal times people travel contracts willingly making 5k week. Restrictions eased lots young (unvaccinated) people socialising getting infected. Hospitalisations deaths low though, look like there's much worry about. media getting excited though - pretty much anyone's reporting higher case rate. find frustrating. Bit technical quickly summarise.  go pub, restaurant, play golf non essential shop restrictions biggie me. u/hatrickstar didn’t kill friend. I’m sorry loss, projecting loss onto someone nothing unfair unjust. None solutions honestly. Neither party wants vaccine passports they're going happen. Neither party wants mandatory vaccinations they're going happen either. point N95s never will. widely available point.  argument kind moot though US pretty much everything fully open right couple weeks months places.  It’s good thing COVID 19 isn’t serious children. don’t think works like lmao Aztra Zeneca. Taiwan already AZ getting used fears potential side effects.

The Taiwanese news talk shows spent couple weeks talking fact none stop.  Yeah it’s stupid. Instead vaccinating 1 pregnant women, vaccinate 2 close contact persons.

51 yo people lung heart condition getting vaccinated now. It’s crazy. Basically unless spend every waking minute trying get appointment wait month. Instructions unclear. Began discriminating airline. sure, e.g. NJ restaurants bars open indoors whole winter. shops. restrictions organized lockdown. Either jobs, close contact older people chance. didn’t seem hard. look numbers, 50% half vaccinated, it’s unreal 80% half vaccinated July. know! he'd gotten lucky first night club.... disease honestly. Flu death rate. Americans willing accept it. Covid different. feel like lot people (like 80-90% honestly), already over. big race yesterday organizers best shoo people away people clearly ready party good time. deflected Faucis errors onto common foe. upvote mining subreddit support that.
*Power you* patchwork across country. And, lot people took personal responsibility limited risks despite whatever rules place. lot people fall group really recently venturing larger numbers. Context: Pregnant women high risk however Germany allow get vaccinated pride overly cautious. Instead simply vaccinated pregnant women ASAP like, example, United States, Germany gave everyone comes contact pregnant woman priority. contrast, 51 alone give priority lot people health conditions recently allowed make appointments (obviously highly depends state in.) *so begins* doctors called vaccine campaign ""floundering"". Which. Yeah that's bad. 

However, government actually put hold vaccine appointments uptake, something initially lack vaccines couple months ago massively expanded virus spiked, presumably uptake great.

Btw efficacy Sinopharm caused initial kerfuffle *IS* 79%. vaccine commenter linked completely different vaccine, Sinovax. thing. people still aren’t vaccinated fall winter that’s 100% them. I’m worried hospitals many people vaccinated Vaccine diplomacy saving lives get planes built sent them. Fill ‘em vaccines speed up. I'd like know too. I'm anxiously waiting get 11.5 yr old vaccinated asap. hope approve sooner later. Esp school starts again!! think that's said, that's took it, power you! get vaccinated? family Prio 3 still chance. take AZ? that’s way heard it’s possible right home town. super lucky. 

If Prio 2 3 gotten vaccinated, Earth get everyone else done 5 weeks? Sorry look reality lies someone telling resigned month ago due incompetence corruption, confess first weekend year ran normal types weekend errands ran prior pandemic. one horny dude wanna guy, US lockdown time recently besides maybe California. brother law facing issue partner September wedding. uncertainty causing lot stress. punish low income essential workers apparent reason flaunt make believe security theater. attempts California trying claim follow science subject blasted right back future things really matter like climate change future pandemics. know even properly look link realise sent cherry picked link vaccine I'm talking about.

They linked something Sinovac vaccine, completely different vaccine Sinopharm I'm talking about. WHO, got 79% efficacy. Sinopharm WHO-approved now, Sinovac (the 50% efficacy one) recently approved days ago emergency use. 

So original comment misinformation whatsoever. talking different vaccines. ""Chinese vaccine"" talking originally mass vaccination programmes.  What, list entire plan you? say asshole end previous post like lol. ""My family fully vaxxed wonderful"" meanwhile there's families vaxxed immunocompromised kids fucking terrified. article nothing Trump yet geezer still bring it.
He’s office months Reddit still obsessed him. lazy comments Best luck bro cure diseases killing grandpas? also dumb thing remove needed. 

It's legally dubious order would seen acceptable courts months virtually unused. 

There would probably less headaches get rid bring back needed. like paid employees. sister boat - immune system doesnt respond vax relies herd immunity. still essentially living house arrest quit job. Fuck no, let's honest pretty odd uncomfortable look Newsom. 

I understand he's it, would less hassle issue new emergency order things get bad fall. court tested afterall. Really?? would amazing!! looked seemed american citizens green card visa holders. son dual nationality get issues. got link this? Thank you!!  Damn Frito Lay !!! problem Newsom REALLY want going courts. 

If stats name sure issues, trys adding restrictions come fall there's likely court fight may actually win emergency declaration persisted months emergency.  post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

BBC News - Covid: Seychelles seen rising case Leaders representatives religious organisations, establishments congregations held accountable places worship fail follow COVID-19 prevention control rules resulting virus transmission among dignitaries, followers, community, according Government Committee Religious Affairs.

This part content document committee recently sent leaders religious organisations, asking enhanced application anti-COVID-19 measures.

The move followed COVID-19 outbreak started religious group named “Hoi thanh truyen giao Phuc Hung” (Revival Ekklesia Mission) Ho Chi Minh City spread many localities.

Therefore, Government committee requested leaders religious organisations continue communication activities encourage dignitaries, followers, establishments seriously adhere instructions COVID-19 prevention control.

They asked suspend religious activities places worship sites registered concentrated religious practices put warning signs areas. Religious establishments sites religious practices must coordinate authorities contact tracing records suspected cases.

The Government committee required religious organisations update COVID-19 information official sources websites means communications, disseminate information facilities remote areas pandemic hotbeds.

It also recommended religious organisations call subsidiaries, dignitaries, followers join hands authorities pandemic fight contribute COVID-19 vaccine fund.

The COVID-19 cluster place worship Revival Ekklesia Mission group Ward 3 Go Vap district, HCM City, found late May 26.

As 3pm June 4, 310 infection cases (F0), 5,377 F1s (people directly meeting confirmed patients), 320,000 F2s (those close contact F1s) related cluster.

Apart 20 22 district-level localities HCM City, outbreak hotbed spread 15 provinces cities, eight reporting infection cases seven others recording F1s F2s.

The numbers F0s, F1s, F2s related cluster forecast keep increasing coming days./. half adult population already vaccinated Germany. Another weeks vaccine hesitancy largest challenge.   I’m seeing article saying examined 200 adolescents, 200 total hospitalized country. source says 200 adolescents total hospitalized? Health Ministry Sunday night reported 60 new domestic Covid-19 infections three major coronavirus hotspots, pushing daily tally 201.

Thirty-one cases Bac Giang Province 18 neighboring Bac Ninh, linked outbreaks industrial parks, isolated following contact tracing.

Of 11 new cases HCMC, 10 associated cluster emerged May 26 Christian congregation called Revival Ekklesia Mission Go Vap District, placed lockdown since May 31. transmission source remaining one remains unclear.

After Vietnam hit new Covid-19 wave five weeks ago, 5,622 community transmissions recorded 39 63 cities provinces, including major cities, industrial hubs localities housing foreign tech giants.

Bac Giang Bac Ninh highest number infections, 3,089 1,093, followed HCMC 376.

On Sunday, Vietnam also saw 58 patients declared free coronavirus, raising total recoveries 3,368. think must distinguish prio 1&amp;2 everyone else.

I agree regards nursing homes residents older people isolate hard home. think like Spain. difference vaccinated not. Everyone allowed things. Germany way strict.

Funnily enough incidence rate higher Spain deaths right way lower Germany. Low trust government, enough production, large amount antivaxxers. Plus Russia led huge propaganda campaign western vaccines backfired - Russians trust vaccine. Cancer patients developed countries named America either Yay, even harder vulnerable get vaccinated. Well didn’t expect response. 😁

Cheers vaccines 💉 countries really mad Taiwan getting vaccines? wanna say no, feel least 1 country furious U.S gave them. Cue confusing headline. 

Delta Airlines. Delta variant.  Really?! wish way stop 90% accuracy care educate us wear mask then?

I've 4 (count - FOUR) places infected (and time, undiagnosed) Covid-19 cases went to, infected others.

These places visit regularly. lucky happen time infected people. people exposed got infected lucky. still suffering long-haul effects today.

Wonder properly apply wear face mask sunny Qld (even though people don't) social-distance properly wherever practicable? Everybody paying don’t get whole world properly vaccinated. look past year. It’s hateful anger like think is. Many people China Taiwan relatives nation may disagree politics autonomy Taiwan don’t actually want kill other. Outside random flexes it’s peaceful decades everyone wants keep way. odds China actually crazy military invasion Taiwan extremely low. literally call guy misinformation supply misinformation. like ""oh hey link proving wrong, still yah know, let change point bit..."" awful. Yeah. Ok, keep acting superior everyone enjoy whatever think impress people. still find hilarious one government got COVID, health minister…  traveling US European territory two weeks ago. Booked drive PCR test Walgreens hour’s notice, result next day. Test free. Wasn’t exactly hassle definitely didn’t increase cost travel 20-40%. 

Testing getting easier cheaper (or free). I’m traveling intensively around US Europe summer two months doesn’t look like I’ll paying single test countries I’m going to. different year ago spent fortune it. things changed. Southern man better keep head Batch testing policy vary country/state/districts. kids kindergarten gets batch tested every week, example. need show symptoms. Like said, depends. equate 30% symptomatic disease. Protection hospitalization death much higher. never thought much lab leak theory recently, fact, (admittedly) dismissed extremist conspiracy theory. looks plausible, fact *intentional*, purpose? would anyone intentionally release pathogen country, unvaccinated population — gain? Genuinely curious, that’s one part can’t wrap mind around. course leak occurred accident, seems understandable. Let's briefly summarize content article:

-US cases time low

-Only 200 known adolescent hospitalizations occurred first 3 months 2021 zero associated deaths

-We making headway approving vaccines &lt;12s

-2/3rds Americans believe returned normal lives

-Activities feared would never return, like cruises, starting come back

-Free beer table


Why earth much good news warrant negative title?!?!? Uh, US bought them.  Enough cover supply chain creating chips. It’s effective vaccine prevent severe illness like mid tier effective vaccines. end day whether it’s worse doesn’t matter better vaccines aren’t available country.
If that’s access use use another vaccine booster later read article.
there significant numbers anymore indonesia... used 90% sinovac... effectness much higher 50%.

Haha link posted earlier said 94% symptoms Indonesia. said, ""Right now"", hospitals healthcare facilities, employers mandated vaccine yet. even mandate, local laws apply many states blocked them. Yes, come, usual, industry waiting come process, standard framework. 

What employers want right is, require employees get vaccinated, one million suffer clots something else, sue employer injuries damages. 

Companies get sued claims filed time, companies want standard framework, point saying ""we everyone else put best effort forward good everyone involved"" HR companies want thing (even legal) end getting sued saying wrong phrase, following procedure, etc. That's hiring separating documents boiler plate following standard.

None matters since OP seem come US, like asked. Kirkland  tried allow posted comments thought shown elementary kids missed weren’t tested unless showed symptoms family school infected. Even article, would missed cases one 8 year old didn’t show parents school knew children tested positive, started testing kids. Others infected – particularly son’s class, also classes year groups. Most, knowledge, asymptomatic took far 12 pupils member staff tested positive. ways, lucky half-term arrived – acting firebreak. Bristol schools early years settings also experiencing outbreaks, 16 Wednesday. least driven transmissible Delta variant first detected India, council said. travel lot, I’m going pretend it’s hobby Correct. following day blasted precautions said things fine. literal power grab.

DeSantis also changes mind frequently. Announcements future meaningless. Fair enough good point, damage done case. Symptomatic not, got boot something totally preventable. You’re simply incorrect True it’s enough calm folks add ones Japan gave us Heard story recently 6 friends meeting who'd one shot 2 recently Covid. tested positive days after. One shot good new variants anti-Vaxxers likely take risks probably hang around unvaccinated people. Personally I'd wait till shots.  Sounds like sensible person. know NJ March 2020, moved October :) think right. recent article indicating traffic fatalities pandemic despite reduced traffic. Increases DUIs largely responsible. lot people started drinking heavily pandemic due boredom they'll likely start driving addicted alcohol. Rhode Island tests per capita.

Massachusetts 2nd test per capita. mean, point would system place 95% population gets vaccinated disease actually eradicated US. Similar mindset, I'm probably still going wear mask never big deal first place. 

But terms getting back normal think everything normally would worried anymore, adding mask still makes sense easy. LISBON – Many frustrated British travellers heading home Sunday shorter-than-expected holiday Algarve 10-day quarantine comes force early next week due rising coronavirus infections Portugal. Howso?

As see it, longest part development vaccine human trials takes amount time regardless kind vaccine used. Yes. did. Marin rural doesn’t many hubs.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  NZ commended did, treated model rest world done. 

Ireland couldn’t even it... **This, exactly.** Specialists telling immunocompromised patients get vaccinated wait. cases, they're telling patients get third dose (please consult physician). 

There unfortunate number poorly informed primary care docs need read literature. Disagree.

To say medical science create immune response better natural immunity folly, proven many, many times past medical science. Yes. friend genetic immune disorder fully vaccinated - doctor upfront know well work. first line get became available. 

He terrible fever spent couple days bed shot, he's hoping means immune system *something* he's stressing much. different vaccine he's gotten now. he's ready wife teenager resume normal activities. They've insanely cautious past year disorder he's ready get back normal whole household vaccinated. probably read India believe that. ""can get vaccine protection it"" also untrue. binary, know try. cases, phyciscians recommended third dose ""two dose"" vaccine courses. 

By repeating this, discouraging people immunosuppressed getting vaccinated, medical guidance. repeat false information vaccination. absolutely factual vital. forget good doctor said don’t want live totalitarian, surveillance state hellhole like apparently don’t want show ”papers“ every time want something. That’s living free country. meant case area US, done close couple sectors, still leave lot open.

And yes still able leave house, least common. could go 5 km away places open supermarkets. roads visibly dead. countries like Greece ever required people book time they'll leave go shopping exercise. said lol. Trump literally claimed thing hoax barely anything substance pandemic became clear couldnt lie anymore thought would help reelection chance. No, proven. Los Angeles County TWICE many people entire country New Zealand. Yeah, still look Feb orders chuckle - product price available till - disagree mRNA vaccines safer. Live attenuated vaccines proven technology. fact first vaccines ever created used live viruses. talking hundreds years usage. six months experience mRNA vaccines. 
However, concede one drawback live virus vaccines can’t used elderly immune compromised, understand. 
I also disagree statement mRNA vaccines “far effective “natural” response”. least would say question settled. Personally would absolutely take natural immunity mRNA immune response. say medical community understands immune response better, folly, proven many, many times past medical science. Flu-like symptoms (chills, soreness, fatigue) kicked 8 hours. Started going away following day fully improved 24 hours onset. explains earlier comment perfectly. Yeah I’m definitely holding travelling things ‘normal’ countries visit. doesn’t sound like good time going back like USA four months ago.  can't way CCP therefore faced massive pushback western nations, including big sanctions.

You can't sanction largest trading partner. hurts exact extent hurts partner. point? would war attrition equal losses sides.

People Western countries overestimate power China. Total American trade China, instance, less 4% Chinese economy.

The US EU could certainly sanction China, would cause tens millions job losses, massive recession, enormous supply chain disruptions, potentially even resulting breakdowns basic infrastructure.

China's economy grows every nine months total value trade America.

Possible disentangle slowly without major shocks, course, sanctions would catastrophic sides. I'd rather around Texans English. think there's ever ""less people"" time Disney World. Lol. Texas literally still getting least many cases Canada per population still taking seriously. also like 45% population first dose vaccine. 

You people fucking nuts declare victory already. George Bush aircraft carrier lol. Smarten  employer issues vaccine themselves. Would workers comp.

It’s condition employment.  largest clusterfuck democracy world! ""I like them, one able cruise.""

I back Royal Caribbean ship soon can. 👍 One best poor doesn’t mean get better treatment “What country five letters long, name beginning CHI, member APEC?” mean closing business yes mean 'not able leave house' no, everywhere. E.g. Switzerland March always possible leave house. ?

The U.K. vaccinated bigger percentage population nations, far US. per capita amount single dose higher US even without available 30s properly Quantity everything. ppl get vaccinated would light case Covid anyway nothing take pressure hospitals. Hence Germany still way many people flashing away Covid compared to, example Spain. yet ... Yep, bacteria that’s resistant antibiotic something health experts watching while. They've gotten fair thanks (💰) see people complaining many millions/billions vaccine makers made... literally saved world, good them.  Moderna doses Canada made less 30% total injected doses date……..so definitely fewer 10 million delivered, probably closer 5 million. Pfizer champion deliveries Canada, taking much slack left Moderna. Oh no, think it’s like normal cold flu labeled covid keep everybody control. like start?

Everywhere Europe apart Sweden lockdown level Italy. Everything apart supermarkets closed Ireland nearly two months genuinely strange see someone street home. Nearly another one beginning year three overall. Australia New Zealand also strict lockdowns beginning sporadic ones since then.  cite shit

saying stuff? stuff? spin right round, Baby! Thanks calmed people anything mild illness somehow still get it’s even worth mentioning. obsess rare cases things? Eventually good enough. one gives damn still get flu flu shot. still get pregnant 99.9% effective IUD. That’s life.  Ok. basically says chief physician states that, low case count, rate hospitalisation &amp; death rate coupled increasing rate vaccination, pandemic essentially Norway. isn’t stating pandemic everywhere - Norway specifically. Louis Vuitton poor man's vaccine. Try Hermes. evidence Long term symptoms sizeable population 6 months? Still way short “vast majority” would say? Bodies dropping like flies Wuhan. Europe carnivals hug Asian competitions ... Reality habbit kicking balls. Unfortunately worked job couldn’t really overstaff 1 hit team. also didn’t get lot PTO would save vacation. That's perfectly normal theory, problem it. least recognize people are/were getting sick. Redditors isolated even know someone lost life even sense smell. concerned risk family member catching flu catching COVID fall. vaccines COVID far effective influenza uptake far higher.

It sucks sequestered like COVID people’s behavior respect nothing actual risks here.  Exactly. People need stop this. virtual last spring end world. school also handled much differently.

That said virus static. Case hospitalizations 18s up. P1 variant(don’t know new name) affecting killing children South America US. over. omitted word New

But point unchanged could barely anything, flu fatigue, thankfully Covid forced retirement couple months later.

Bummer still work, hopefully businesses rethink sick days work home, workers actually stay home sick instead taking illness office, actually rest get better! could remote work half days. don’t that. buy China. That’s it, strings attached

Do source saying apart China? find out? get infected Ahaha rich, guy leaking hate toward others telling see counselor. No, hasn't. People like pretended death rate thing matters, true. like: Artificial Stupidity System

Murdering everybody ___not___ ""intelligence"". Maybe good idea government announce relaxed restrictions vaccinated folks people could actually get vaccinated. Awesome thank updating!! mostly care family getting vaccinated thats good me. deal proofs later :) zero evidence 80-90% number.

Iirc cases dropped like rock Israel 50ish percent. argument you’re making almost like saying shouldn’t drive. risk dying car accident way higher every time drive risk getting severe Covid dying post-vaccine. I'm graduate student department many international students. COVID, many opportunities visit family expensive. now, many seen families years COVID. 

A lab mate mine wanted go home SE Asia winter break seen family two years. advisor pretty much said, can't stop good chance allowed back country unknown length time. 

He ended visiting. felt awful problem visit family holidays (we followed many precautions possible time one tested positive COVID). mean what's point trying make?

In context discussion, ""can get vaccine protection it"" vs ""can't get vaccine"" really matter?

The point people can't get protected relying herd immunity, anti vaxxers screwing up. lol... price acknowledge part china.

What NEVER do... would invite annexation Everyone seems enjoy restricting UK throughout may well lol mean, they've COVID, anti-bodies, right? Heck, EU, understanding, travel recently recovered person. me, got chills hours arm sore days. that, felt fine. Stop moving goal posts. goal always reduce death hospitalizations manageable level. since last March. doesnt work someone effectively getting it. feel like meaningful distinction draw Norwegian. No. hang try talk sense lol Plenty anti-vaxxers found globally. Here’s opinion- they’re assholes. you?  41 counties still 50% capacity indoor dining, 15% indoor gym capacity, 4 counties still can’t even bars opened up. Kids going school person 3 hours day…California still open fully stretch. settled 1949. always try rematch Taiwan might end historical term only. read article? So...less .3% population? Sorry, people always danger communicable diseases. continue wear masks, avoid church/crowded bars, socialize outside. least 74 million Americans already accept number deaths, long they're inconvenienced.  people can't get vaccine people allergic vaccine's ingredients. respect people working stores, wore mask. Yep, one said problem said. Notice admit problem? go talk therapist something.  Would go homeless get random person back zero connection to? Oh hi fellow waiting Japanese :) It’s rare reinfected short time period natural infection likely offers better protection vaccine. Sure countries maintain lockdowns safety precautions countries fortunate enough strong vaccination numbers variants effect thing. Worrying far despite several weeks increasing infections seen significant rise hospitalisations deaths. vast majority going hospital offered vaccine refused.  asked people gave reasonable explanations [I one  run numbers get enough vaccines day now

Which almost correct. However, nobody said ""any day now"". it'll weeks we'll demand issue instead supply issue. early July we're unlucky, hopefully late July uptake ignore fact due give everyone 2nd shot now

We've couple weeks already, first doses slowed past 2 3 weeks. Now, increased deliveries BioNTech/Pfizer, possible administer lot first doses again. vaccination centers though, additional doses going GPs company doctors.   stop transmission old vulnerable people can't get sick. So... countries large scale vaccination efforts still rolling vaccine efforts?  


You realize world exists outside West yeah? read article? I'm reacting linked part story. No, I've saying r/de something like ""end Q2, almost everyone able get first dose wait bit longer"".

And guess what, almost 50% population least one dose expect huge deliveries June. means 2/3 want get vaccine already one dose, still weeks Q2 get close ""most people"". Remember never hit 100% uptake, kids recommended get vaccine right now. Even 100% adults vaccinated, would 85% population. uptake 80%, would able vaccinate close 70% population. 45% done 70% pretty good already, \~25% go happening next \~4 weeks.

So turns small minority r/de right claimed things January (heavily downvoted apparently absolutes Totalversagen government). Japan lot vaccines, Japan’s vaccine hesitancy whole different historical beast best way get antivaxxers interested send vaccines poor countries. possibly expose people vaccination center. think anything, it’ll lead Biden Administration probably delay reopening travel UK. Okay, even indoor dining open, possible restrictions could apart capacity limits?

I seriously cannot get lockdown Americans complaining about. lockdown able leave house non-essential business closed. Every one Intel briefings knew would bad February 2020.

And proceeded lie it. pixels one wishing someone else get sick suffer :3 Better drive kids anywhere. children die car accidents every year US Thanks! that's totally bad reading article. :) government fucking sucks 

Welcome India’s problems. Would rather global health implications organisation kicked mainland China? really hoping social distancing would stick around grocery stores. 6 feet away signs people 3-4 feet away nice. removed everything people right line again. England went lockdown knew already works. literally dozens countries so. “Most, knowledge, asymptomatic took test.” needs operate PROC billion people, requires appeasement authoritarian government territorial claims, doesn’t deny existence island people, refuses say loud it’s independent political entity article mentions it. research found clinical trials going Stanford, Yale, Rutgers children 12. Here's Google result articles weren’t guns bombs tanks, real trauma experienced there’s good number people working healthcare right suffer PTSD virus families friends communities.

Absolutely. make like war - despite misconception, many things war cause trauma PTSD. illustrates. greater good... I'm 22 offered mine fit trend. quite sure they're honestly. First, also huge expensive process keep using ventilators ECMO machines weeks physical labor health care workers keep anti-vax COVID patients alive, I'm sure cost benefit analysis taking account.

As questions, I'd say state's drivers' licensing system expanded create vaccine ID's too. get DMV long vaccine card pharmacy mass vax center got shot at. Alternatively also get passport signed doctors' note saying health reasons (allergies conditions) cannot take vaccine.

Some bars let underage people in, often eventually busted police. I'd imagine something similar could way enforced. 

No one prevents fakes; point foolproof system, system keeps immunocompromised people mostly safe go restaurants go work, STRONGLY encourages vaccination.

I'm pretending answers solution; one possible suggestion list questions seem trying imply unsolvable. lots ways implement kinds things countries already done - clearly think cost benefit analysis weighs favor kind vaccine passport system. point article though....we accept risk point. Everyone definitely different interpretation acceptable risk, hence discussion. long vaccines work it, they'll still prevent severe illness hospitalizations. 

Number cases carry weight did, long population vaccinated. 

1st dose works keep hospital 2nd dose really needed ensure variant spread exponentially. Yep keep telling everyone else wrong/bad/misinformed, meet expectations. Yep, I'm one ""negative"" emotions. Ok. fun. people keep saying ""we need vaccinate everyone."" know people going refuse. We're never going live world 100% vaccination rate. feel like lot people (like 80-90% honestly), already over.

Totally agree you. live rural area. checked 40% county fully vaccinated. week go store less less people seem wearing masks worrying social distancing.

I doubt many vaccinated. least fear anymore get life. afraid new variants appear faster world vaccinated. Many countries 1-2% vaccinated Sinovac Sinopharm.  They’re also locking there’s minimal cases doesn’t continue spread. IMO makes sense vaccinating countries like US (earlier year) India (a months ago) actual outbreaks thousands people dying. Australian states return complete normal lockdown over. everyone, kids 12 still can’t get one.  got text asking book, despite left UK 2 years ago :) 29 heavier cycle second vaccine (didn’t one first second) went back normal next.  one allows continued enforcement current indefinite mask mandate essential. needlessly punishes low income don’t privilege working home.  sure much everybody knows everybody bigger offices, know isnt office.  able see ahead time acceptable deaths come peoples political leanings.

I mean themselves. crazy. bought vaccines donating free one allies. interesting, link support claim? Like Lancet biorxiv article? Thanks. 25+ opened. 2 years time next week. full lockdown year. Even places one. *unless 12 medical condition (such needing SCT) prevents getting vaccinated always irritates me, adults kids: it’s deaths. nice ends way 1920 flu pandemic ended: acceptable death rate. don’t think governor holding state emergency bit longer impacts anyone imposes restrictions, please, tell restrictions suggested imposing others... declaring reached point death acceptance? don’t get declare it’s pretty reckless so. sort thinking lead less people deciding vaccinate. limited supply much, much higher uptake people

We 30+ still 76.5% adults one dose millions still waiting turn June 5,23.75% 65+ years old Tokyo got first shot! (under 65 yet except medical personnel) types variants possible compatible human beings lessening. could still happen Covid running mutations great , Taiwan also get 5 million Moderna vaccine bought paid ? think less tenth delivered far.  heard 25+ several others. sure accurate though That's guys ran 60+ people vaccinate Aren’t still spreading point though? It’s great people lesser reactions still give somebody won’t lucky. threshold children 12 developing long haul covid symptoms +60 days us continue impose restrictions? brain fog 5% children 12 get covid much risk ease restrictions?  mentioned upvotes downvotes prove (pretty easily) people read comment seem agree. Nice ad hominem way. US physically cannot control borders though kinda pointless expect us Australia/New Zealand/SK response. could done China/Vietnam response mandatory quarantine guard rapid deployment contact tracing. well numbers, believe going priority groups. add priority groups 1+2+3, first doses according total percentage done, clearly way that. non-priority people vaccinated? UK much better organised - everyone gets letter inviting vaccination, order, according priority. understand German system centralised, lacking, particularly apparently political involvement everything. left entirely vaccination experts. don’t think it’s real, sadly. grandparents uncle think covid overblown, don’t believe masks haven’t worn entire time unless store actually strict requirements. won’t get deeper believe, basically believe covid hoax everybody dying something else. lots people late 50s early 60s able get vaccinated, meanwhile tons people 20s 30s have. People 20s/30s lying / live order get vaccinated faster. say sadly. Taiwan, country, really well covid. Get yer shit together UK we've vaccinating 18+ US states month. emerging variants becoming increasingly contagious. measures effective beginning pandemic. What’s matter time? “massive outbreak” keep predicting? Gotta agree you’re likely jealous countries like NZ. know right. Hard believe new hires everyone. Germany great distribute administer doses, among best Europe believe Denmark higher percentage vaccinated people countries use EMA approved vaccines. However, prioritisation mishandling gets vaccine mess quite time starting tomorrow clusterfuck fear Oh wow. asthma really use inhaler I’m sick now, somebody shape needing one says lot damage lungs. None, every time new VOC appearing - probability increases. Although 3-d shot would probably advised elders tackle Delta variant. makes sense, thanks! No, 300 deaths still high risk parents who’d rather take chance all. own.  Almost certainly not. seem opening 2 years time, “under 30s”, it’ll start 28-30 year olds ""I'm sympathetic but..."" really sympathetic. Well, mentioned downvotes didn’t you? 
It doesn’t upset all, hated trump dems love hate him.
Certainly enough provoke current variant vaccine resistant fully vaccinated individuals? None? Yes, vaccines lockdowns options. lockdowns, option countries vaccine shortage. Dismissing threat, brought Delta VOC dangerous. I'm unfortunately shocked. end day lot people can't see 3 inches past nose. state higher numbers like 1/3 1/4 population we’re considered good. didn’t agree people fighting recall wouldn’t open stuff still rocky, like said-this giving go with.  someone unfortunate COVID — still don’t want put child avoid it. kids get vaccinated fall big jump towards herd immunity. immunocompromised. - even Dr. segev, running study, shocked ineffective population Canada gap doses extended 16 weeks. far 60%+ population received first dose, 6% received second. Many people convinced they're invincible getting first shot (even though they're not). would imagine people UK think way, rollout strategy similar (or least 3 weeks ago started accelerating second doses). Well happens shopping shotgun it’s good money atm. would equal amount incentive personally cash. asked question context comment thread. also used dump raw sewage street. ""The way always been"" compelling argument. Worth mentioning even though 0-11 year olds access vaccines 12-15 year olds recently got access, case rates continued dropping along rest country. 

Click 'Age' cases link see trends time. Unfortunately age ranges even, little math get roughly like like comparisons. probably B.1.1.7. P.1 could worse. said anything popularity? article people bashing Trump fuckups upsets much, I’m sure you’re besides lame trolling attempts. Death isn’t bad long-term outcome. I’m tired people acting like death rate outcome matters far risk goes. remove ambiguity, adults 30? I'm hoping indeed case I've wanting one able get one due age. AZ filed paperwork, plus there's zero reason US use it. better vaccines available, we've got supply vaccines demand. 

AZ also seem manufacturing capability US Emergent figure stop fucking everything touch. Guys know.... UK 70% vaxxed currently facing second spike (sharp increase cases) new delta variant. 

I hope USA follow suit, science says will.. i'm confused hype spewed here. insane? Keeping emergency authority place doesn’t mean restrictions can’t lifted What’s even monstrous could position vaccinate everyone right US hadn’t blocked IP waivers favor (now proven have) failed, public-private partnerships. proposals technology transfers scaling production pandemic’s outset poor countries knew going play out. Instead, chose protect pharma profits countless lives, even though mRNA vaccinate technology byproduct decades global scientific research. Many, many deaths continue completely unnecessary. pandemics going symptom climate crisis. 50%! That's concerning. Grandmother received Moderna. think referring Bush Obama administrations maintained pandemic response task force within CDC would able things like quickly spin PPE production, surge hospitals, contact tracing case pandemic. Trump administration dismantled whole thing Covid hit. story /r/Boston gal First off, obviously rhetorical question implying seeing increase. Secondly put crossed misspelled fear mongering shit make point pushed back I'm sick every article variants news media called ""fear mongering"". want read many others want purposefully kept dark future possibilities like many seem want. hear you. appreciate advice. would like take more. may wait longer people vaccinated. Come Texas. too.  It’s like we’re opening new branch Civ tech tree. way beat virus herd immunity, either vaccines catching covid. Social distancing masking delaying problem appreciate kind words.

I'll see going. think surge, hoping best want continue safe. use mRNA vaccines, they? mainly used Sinovac Sinopharm, traditional vaccines easier store. Moreover, current focus urban area first. reasonable evidence say China lying cannot realistically achieve number. vaccination rate may drop future move rural areas, vaccines less effective Pfizer Moderna, see concrete evidence discredit them. shouldve sent horny jail  modern history catastrophic infectious diseases Brazil, children often suffer terms deaths disability. dengue epidemics emerged Brazil 2007 2008, children accounted half fatalities. pregnant women became infected the [Zika epidemic began 2015, 1,600 newborn Brazilian infants born devastating microcephaly birth defects, far nation. Respiratory viruses continue disproportionately affect Brazil’s children, hookworms intestinal parasites stunt childhood growth development, especially poor rural areas.

Now Covid-19 causing severe illness young Brazilian children levels seen parts world. Research Dr. Fatima Marinho Vital Strategies, nongovernmental organization, [has found 2,200 children age 10 died Covid-19. number represents less 0.5 percent Brazil’s 467,000 Covid-19 deaths, 900 fatalities occurred children age 5. United States recorded nearly 600,000 deaths Covid-19, 113 children age 5.

We studied Covid-19 infection rates adolescents children state São Paulo, home 20 percent Brazil’s population. analysis found surge numbers reported cases hospitalizations among adolescents children since end 2020. Approximately half hospitalizations, 900, among children younger 5, including many infants.

When pandemic began last year, coronavirus [appeared affect less frequently, less severely, adults. many young children Brazil hospitalized dying Covid-19? Identifying answer critical health children South America; it’s also vital understanding path coronavirus pandemic may take future.

One possible explanation lies Brazil’s emerging variants concern. predominant strain coronavirus circulating Brazil P.1 variant — now according World Health Organization week. Like Beta (the new name B.1.351 variant, first identified South Africa), Gamma variant transmissible compared earlier virus lineages, may able partially escape antibodies produced Covid-19 infection vaccine. possible mutations make Gamma transmissible also contribute higher rates infections, hospitalizations deaths among children.

Of course, it’s equally likely rise Covid-19 cases among children part uncontrolled spread Gamma across age groups. Pregnant women get Covid-19 higher risk severe illness preterm births, women infected may pass coronavirus newborns.

Given presence Gamma variant United States — 7 percent Covid-19 cases United States attributed variant — it’s possible pediatric newborn Covid-19 cases could soon become prevalent. cause serious concern.

While B.1.1.7 variant, called Alpha, responsible two-thirds coronavirus cases United States, Gamma appears spreading quickly areas. Illinois Gamma 22.4 percent cases coronavirus strains genetically sequenced; Massachusetts, 13.6 percent sequenced Covid cases caused Gamma variant.

If Gamma variant continues spread outpaces vaccination efforts United States, officials may need reinstate virus mitigation measures identify new ones. Booster shots tailored variants may critical. United States needs continue efforts vaccinate adolescents approve vaccines younger children infants. Public health officials must also continue educate parents real threat Covid-19 poses children importance vaccination. Otherwise, pediatric infant Covid-19 may become tragic new reality.

The Covid-19 crisis Brazil result the [government’s take adequate public health measures limit transmission coronavirus, well inadequate supplies vaccines. transmissible variants spread, similar crises unfolding South America, well India Democratic Republic Congo. Brazil’s experience illustrates children suffer unless governments global community take bold action. research previous pandemics, killed many one. follow time, bu!&lt;t also seems like good idea prevent around 1 10,000 chance.  deeply familiar state politics, rescinds state emergency, can't re-instate future case of, know, emergency? like FFS think governor's done good bad really throwing fuel recall folks. daughter got second dose April 24. One 4.3%. wanted it. I'm wondering lot teens making fuss it, parents problem it. don’t deny possibility another variant. It’s 100% going happen flu. think fear mongering blown proportion. good health care already Covid :) experience flu worse that’s anecdotal.  100% guaranteed? virus could theory mutate like viruses? example, HIV mutated quite bit. would take several decades aggressive vaccination campaigns, it’s even possible, might worth get control, given relatively low IFR. There’s dangerous diseases like polio rubella still haven’t fully eradicated, we’re going extinction there’s priorities. Still boggles mind UK insists keeping US ""amber list"" (ie, require 10 day quarantine entering country US). Hey know nearly entire globe significantly behind vaccinations compared US :) particularly EU Mexico called case need proof

Oh please educate way travel advisories go: spread misinformation, educate people chance get vaccinated, get virus, it’s problem society. enforce restrictions them. made bed ans lie it. impression I’ve read mRNA vaccines safer. Historically, they’ve problems live attenuated vaccines, sometimes don’t get attenuated enough something. Check article subject: vaccines proven far effective “natural” response: second dose vaccine, antibody titers 10 times higher patients recovered natural COVID-19 infection, suggesting even prior exposure could benefit vaccination.  pfizer, vaccines? would agree you. Newsom decline eliminate mask mandate hinted capacity restrictions remain. I've public health friend tell think like entire state go yellow tier.  yesterday press conference. though bears noting lockdown, he's going go promised full reopening june 15th. two weeks, dude trust bro. Smallpox likely infectious Covid. Measles definitely infectious Covid. first longer exists second complete control every western country. Infectiousness really matter here. matters mutability animal reservoirs, covid definitely has. French Toast also works. like completely forgotten natural immunity thing. Why? definition, infection asymptomatic, long haul symptoms. Bc touch Hey know vaccines work? reason prevent vaccinated travelers crossing borders. World Health Organization Wednesday said know virus prevents transmission vaccinated people aware that.

And yet said knew exactly... funny that!

I've linked actual studies evidence stop transmission. linked one person essentially said ""be careful"" determined know precise extent reduce transmission husband said transmission reduction's current estimation 0.002%-0.005% recent studies. Again, he's doctor public health getting direction CDC viewing date say he's clueless going studies guidance ignoring science.


Again giving anecdotal evidence based hearsay based appeal authority - I'm giving links *actual* studies giving reduction 40-50% reduced transmission. 
 
Do really see difference?!

Here studies  Wow thats true ok Yet still limits gatherings people going wear masks summer. lockdown would work that’s decision they’ll live with. Vaccine: ""Gg, re"" Hey know we’re pandemic :)

:( Get ready see ""vaxine certicutes"" written crayon new thing. I've always said extremely dishonest heart disease cancer constantly killing people much higher rate wars ever would could kill people. Hell almost every war people died disease combat. People die diseases time that's diseases are, things kill us alot time. However whole level tragedy suffering humans kill other. precisely wrong allowing continue it. COVID hardly emergency point. Sure people might die probably NEVER going go away. messy AF. worked small office one dick refused shot still worked there, would whizz Starbucks.... lesson get whatever vaccine get offered it.  erratic policy sustainable long term.

Yeah 3 4 small lockdowns even pass week country past year made everything go shit.  great news! Fully agreed I've saying months. bad comparison. 100% American population exposed dangers COVID. Realistically, percentage population exposed dangers WWII? goes comparing COVID 9/11. borders still closed Europeans Mexicans? seems neither political party wants free, open world freedom movement easy-to-cross borders. Neither party wants open borders, parties xenophobic. World Health Organization Wednesday said know virus prevents transmission vaccinated people aware that. Margaret Harris said vaccinated still need careful protect others. vaccine tested designed stop severe disease stop people dying severe virus, public health physician said. ""We know whether stop transmission person person important people think 'I'm vaccinated, like' case,"" said Dr Harris.

My husband said transmission reduction's current estimation 0.002%-0.005% recent studies. Again, he's doctor public health getting direction CDC viewing date say he's clueless going studies guidance ignoring science. cautious anyone symptoms (even flu symptoms) wear mask distance themselves. variants spreading keep monitored.

But yes, areas low vaccination continue avoid socialization increase significantly. get point it’s pretty selfish want others enjoy life can’t yet. Like much want vaccine freedom I’m also really happy travel book hair styling appointments.  According new numbers given 180k deaths year US using current numbers.... would say premature excitement but, def step right direction haven’t seen much Delta outbreak US much population unvaccinated? Anyone know? ;) view bit different: Chicago Cubs made deal devil win World Series, caused timeline shift. Remember curse Cubs curse goat. :-) ;) Masks still coming off, still power go back lockdown.

[Vaccine FAQ Part FAQ Part appointment bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* 500 deaths day... moment quite lot disclaimers go well together get big picture makes sense, confuses first lol people hospital tested positive Covid people hospital Covid?  logic, restaurant outdoors.

Goodluck eating pizza mask on. right focusing number cases. want full picture recommend look CDC State Profile updates. CDC currently looks 4 metric determine transmission risk. include new cases, new deaths, lab positivity rate, new hospitalizations.  Holy fuck  think ever closed. would imagine live attentuated virus harder appropriate variants.. What's point comment? saying hiding covid deaths? Seychelles use AstaZeneca? I'm remembering right would explain large increase cases long ago despite majority folks vaccinated. look CDC criteria, puts death rate 1.16 new deaths per 100,000 per week considered orange tier 0.16 away yellow tier. 

It's high also low. fact, closer low high. 

Source: Questions like feel like you’re one people doesn’t believe virus real. Tell that’s so. 

If you’re sincere, homeless much less likely get tested much likely die alone without anyone giving fuck killed them. asked like *like* windows, though...

You even know he's window enthusiast. Yeah that’s true. even then, that’s 10-15% per state, would still need 55% least. point. People wear masks social distance, decide weekend family close friends safe trust them. Close friend brings friend stopped someone else’s house last week. started feeling like cold yesterday. don’t say anything - it’s Covid don’t know it. 5 minutes pass by, people house get exposed. people find exposed week later (if all), point they’ve already gone church visited friend. Maybe got sick spread without knowing. Maybe one got plane.

I think another thing - masks might well-fitted, might mishandled. Cross-contamination might happening. Maybe isn’t adequate ventilation public space people crowded together.

An extremely contagious respiratory virus long latency period, people unknowingly exposing friends, families communities days, lack testing, continued local international travel, absurd politicization virus, lack vaccines, long wait test results... there’s way could ever totally control conditions. masks, social distancing, lockdowns saved lives prevented collapse healthcare system United States. came close states communities. lift warning beacon long lit let people decide stupid wanna be. hard accept, deaths would happened US president, Americans are. 

Regardless, deaths compared leading causes death, like heart disease &amp; cancer.. least respectable news sources. wonder progress mRNA vaccines humans, pandemic we're facing. aside calling also refresh page available slots, cost 30 mins earlier week find slot 4 days (today) town. Makes total sense Yeah shit Ah yes sweeping carpet plan dems Biden could elected China could control usa! /s  biggest ""health risk"" could come grown men might suck couple days?

LOL. That's good reason get vaccinated. least sort understand group. They're age feeling invincible, parents can't force them. rather expected they'd difficult group reach.
 
16+17 though.. Parent: ""Get car, we're going go get covid vaccination. No, debate.""  Today marks 40th anniversary HIV diagnosis . Let's pray cure.  Per Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) used collect reports adverse events vaccination general public. primarily used identify potential topics investigate regards vaccine reactions. However, event data VAERS often verified often self-reported, assumed adverse events VAERS actually associated cause vaccines, possible estimate frequency adverse events data.

Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  Maybe make racist/authoritarian suffering? Nah, it'll back fall enough people gotten vaccine. Sadly, that's works. Vaccination equate immunity. efficacy 95% means 5% symptomatic. Israel data indicates another 10% asymptomatic.

So, 70% vaccinated roughly 60% immunity. sources say 80% required herd immunity 🤷🏼‍♂️  ""We expect definite readouts submit EUA two cohorts, including children two five years age five 11 years age September. readout submission cohort children six months two years old expected fourth quarter."" That's great hear, although sad hear 16 month old eligible yet need wait little longer. variant causing surge hospitalizations death UK, infections.  Thanks! seems right, fully accurate 80-90% number. rationale don’t know percent needed herd immunity Covid specifically, 80-90% generally case viruses. example: measles 95%, polio 80%, mumps 86%. 

However, little googling found estimates Covid actually “70% higher”, per Dr. Betty Chung Cambridge department pathology. see tweet subject webMD Fully Vaccinated (Moderna) worried nephews (6 7 yrs old, vaccinated) live with. 
I've heard Vaccine keep personally safe still carrier infection still spread non-vaccinated? 
Also, articles read matter appreciated!  what’s suggestion? I’m vaccinated longer feel need take precautions. forever wear masks could get sick? don’t flu season. I've dealing people caring safety forego medical treatment year, becoming unable take care months barely clawing way back functioning. really hard give many fucks year danger due people's callousness. situation particular one, people dealt danger stress due people's callousness.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* need keep sharing vaccine supplies. union workplace, existing employees can't forced vaccination. Union contract would allow it. new employees yet union members fair game requirements. Idk people downvoting much, bring real point. may disagree everyone's best interest China without actually removing really know would be. Lethality assessed host community level? High transmissibilty leads overall deaths.   would go homeless risk financial ruin someone know? Cause that's asking person responding - do. journal article Nature alternative point clearly shows SARS-CoV-2 spike protein optimized binding human-like ACE2 result natural selection.

My view, fwiw, may never know answer question scientific certainty. Right now, think soon say. Get grip dude circumstantial ""3 workers got sick"" argument looking increasingly flimsy they've potentially found Covid-19 European wastewater year found China. health cant see fucking SMOG car bought BTC using electricity.

In China. Again, that's relevant. population people want vaccine can't get get protection greater zero. Antivaxxers putting people risk fault own, that's point I'm making.

Everything else saying true that's tangent really I'm talking person life who’s tested positive since March someone vaccinated. It’s absolutely still possible. almost hospitalized well 2nd time getting COVID. got April 2020 too. callousness comments thread make lose faith humanity. number human being. remember 'playing devil's advocate' brushing simple statistics. Yes, fact people die, heartless it. Where's censorship here? government step tell Twitter do. Twitter company they're subject censorship laws. Try again. Oh yeah? Twitter government? Actually, anywhere breakdown sanitation services possibility cholera outbreak. See: Yemen. Modern sanitation (clean water, hand washing, proper disposalof human feces) reduced prevalence cholera outbreaks... still outbreaks. Cholera outbreaks get managed eradicated. 1.3 million blood cancer US alone. add cancer treatment number course even larger. forget make sure highest bidder gets first? really think praised offered place heaven fearmonging vaccines? months ago.

No, got 70 percent. Come back 95% 50s done

Supply constrained U.K. we’ve prioritise  Christ, local Stop Shop giving out, along M&amp;M cookies bakery next pharmacy counter.  Eh, let dumbs die off. Small economic price pay fewer idiots around future. I'm vaccinated. encourage everyone get vaccinated.  exactly second statement eludes to? said anything lockdowns? don’t think anyone suggesting that. still easy prevention methods take kids vaccinated like indoor masking stores. always small subset population susceptible disease. sympathize them, make small portion population public policy ever them.
 
They need take additional precautions protect themselves. Continue wearing masks, social distancing, completely avoiding large crowds. vaccinated point fault deserve whatever coming you. pandemic basically states anyone dies immunocompromised deserves get refusing vaccine. I'm glad things finally getting back normal guys. many (long!) Lockdowns, know gone loopy now. “BUT MUH **DELTA VARIANT!!!!!**”

-Mainstream Media That's interesting thing. people suggests continue mask protect children, yet flu much higher death rate COVID-19 people 15 years age.

The flu much less contagious covid. Imagine two diseases, disease mortality rate 1% disease B mortality rate 0.1%. 1% population gets disease year, 50% gets disease B, disease B kill people despite ""having much lower death rate."" relevant covid killed many kids last year flu normal year--it less lethal, many kids got it, precautions.

I disagree many people thought arguments through, also can't leave half picture analysis, done here. Who????? Glorious China wants help Taiwan province China! American Imperialists want spread disinformation stop vaccination evilness nature. Glorious leader show us way bright future! Great. yes taking account, looks like pandemic ends US year (2021). point, suppose vaccine exporting going parts world yet them. oversupply able export some. word liar strong connotation accusative it’s best use professional setting People soft. awful part is, people aren’t vaxxed choice (too young, sick). exposed risk ignorant anti-vaxxers. No. That’s many health authorities pushed reopening schools. rich private schools went back person quickly. 

They spread it, much adults (or teenagers—who don’t really slower spread). 

Nor fact schools outbreaks contradict it. Minor role doesn’t mean “no role.” Part bill collecting works US, get paid something sell debt collectors. collect original amount even nobody actually pays price. Riiight thanks, think I'll trust medical professionals rather stuck internet troll thank you. nice day. *deaf ears. many people realize pay thousands hospitalizations increased insurance premiums taxes. thinking thousands unvaccinated people die get hospitalized incredibly selfish reckless. still work responsibility other. people avoiding vaccine far stupid understanding technology. I've yet find single anti-vaxer even rudimentary understanding mRNA vector based vaccines work - know they're bad, damnit.  need chips man! part solution. problem. need get people vaccinated. you’re counterproductive. Yarp. $55.6 billion 2.4% including defensive medicine practiced result, small factor.

Each year, health care payers providers United States spend $496 billion billing insurance-related costs.

The pharmaceutical industry profitable world measured return invested capital, according to study nonprofit, nonpartisan West Health Policy Center. Large drug companies generated 17.3 percent return compared 11.3 percent across industries.

Big pharma spends marketing research, large portion research budget spent modifications existing drugs, whereas novel pharmaceutical research mostly public funding. I...declare...bankruptcyyyyy wat wondering know vaccines develop antibodies Leukemia patients common form treatment, pill form BTK inhibitor. Next week alone 6.5 million doses, enough vaccinate 10% adult population.

And lot used second doses people already vaccinated, actually true lot unvaccined people problems getting appointment first dose.

[Check blue line first doses green line second doses administered. grey line projected demand second doses, still go next week.

The rate first doses going last three weeks rising demand second doses. Next week probably still see rise first doses addional supply. First doses *really* pick near end June we're past demand second doses. US / Canada next? Sept would amazing. They'll fine  That’s good way looking it. Increased risk sometimes calls increased safety measures. Covid extremely contagious. mean like mask mandates ended?

Some emergency measures really emergency, end emergency (in case mask mandates, hospitals longer danger overwhelmed). Give Ireland instead  Thank decent person. short supply days. People smugly talking okay thousands dying...  Free speech takes another hit even though absolutely nothing free speech... Got it. Every totalitarian state uses similar “emergency measure“ justifications strip away rights. “temporary“ measures happen never go away. state that? Americans could still freely travel Hawaii, freely state state.  15bn total? Since many people world? Liberty freedom dictates America never ready pandemic. Ireland EU tax haven, parasite Germany France might dumb question would mRNA Vaccine cure already infected hiv patient ? chances vaccinated person spreading coronavirus nearly zero. follow science dont get though, everyone's everything (masks, distance, staying home/within core circles, washing, sanitizing) would *not* affect case numbers? Unless people masking public, fashionably compliant, gatherings others masking way, masking gatherings because, ""it's good, we've *ALL* wearing masks everywhere, safe space!"" enough people thinking living way, nullifies mask wearing altogether.  include exclude proteins influenza administered flu shots? location terrible compliance low numbers I’m NY pretty disappointed vaccination progress tbh. poster said, correct. antigen tests acceptable quite cheap options self administer meets requirements allow antigen tests, expensive. shows fast mRNA vaccines tailor made deployed. personally think we're going see great breakthroughs mRNA techniques. lot people want visit family. Unless one ones die like friend, 42, marathon runner.   NYC still pretty masked far see. don't. We've seen protests. days polite cordial Canadian reputation over. love idea forgiving debt vaccinating travel negative thing. Like sign sheet? volunteer? 

My actual favourite part comments religious nut adamant Jesus way back covid vaccinations foretold revelations, anti-german anarchist type arguing jesus, biological warfare. loved it. It’s quite common, usually talking culturally though. Potholer54 great science youtuber. J&amp;J counted 2 here? Moderna started making covid vaccine January 2020 shipped first batch vaccines NIH February 24th ridiculous PPE still issue year pandemic. discussion. first hit, ok, **maybe** reasonable ask healthcare workers take risks save lives, year later absurd.
 
We ask cops break riot without riot gear. ask firefighters rush burning building without turn-out gear air-packs. even send soldiers war without weapons bullet proof vests.
 
Healthcare workers world need put collective feet flat refuse work adequate PPE available. Let bean counters politicians attend patients without proper protection. (noun)
the practice persuading someone something using force threats.

By definition, coercion requires something harmful person make comply.

If insist offering negative, could say government citizens vaccinate rewards. nobody forced vaccinate punished vaccinating. Centuries* There’s lots different vaccines, it’s tiny percentage advised them. course every country access one. Yeah. Like I’m visiting Tennessee right (spending summer CA,) social distancing masking all, yet Ontario’s equivalent case numbers 550/day (there currently 250 7-day average TN). Ontario right double despite full lockdown No, Moderna sequenced vaccine two days January 2020. Nah Moderna developed vaccine two days release coronavirus gene sequence January 2020:  ain’t it. That’s fucked people China *always* bad lying, matter evidence contrary. 

I mean yeah done/are *a lot* bad shit yes government lies international community lot, countries verifying claim instance I've seen zero evidence they're lying time. Based analytics would disagree. paying everyone vaccinations proportional overall benefit society. falls corporations US what's broken. Costs likely scenario states like Mississippi Wyoming embarrassing amounts people unvaccinated see COVID wave fall, anywhere big waves last year April. places like Vermont Massachusetts, sheer number people vaccinated areas prevent major surge happening. Vaccines work, it’s fucking shame everyone willing get one.  lotteries make regret getting shot without anything return. doubt I'm alone feeling. 
This bad practice, like paying ransoms. encourages people demanding later. I’m confused chatting issues OP expressing sympathetic people condition jumped throat saying couldn’t give shit fuck monetary losses past year. find overwhelmed days receive ~250 emails (even though safely ignore maybe 1/4 them).

No one going 2000 emails daily without help. offense, what’s point here? advocating indefinite lockdowns? that’s I’m pushing back on. DE vaccination centre first doses last couple weeks extra vaccine, I'm hopeful. Really?? see this? would \*thrilled\* youngsters could get vaccinated sooner rather later. course are. point though, world see lot variants coming years. probability current vaccine-resistant VOC increase new VOC. flu shot isn’t proven anything anyone though. could protecting completely wrong strain. It’s guesswork. covid vaccine light years effective yearly flu vaccine Why, Taiwan 1st World country, let get own.

Give poor country/region hemisphere. People medical conditions give higher chance severe deadly case CV19. case good friend Lung condition cardiac problem. told doctors still young vaccinated, 51 years old. sure thinking vaccinating healthy 40s. come military family. grandfather served WW2 father served Vietnam first Gulf War. 

I’m making light combat I’m making direct comparison. said “FELT like fucking war.”

Myself, along many others fought help save lives fellow countrymen women multiple occasions failed, lack trying, enemy fighting simply much us manage.

I’m including grannies grandpas highly susceptible virus, I’ve seen physically fit healthy individuals lose legs, heart attacks, go heart failure, neurological injuries unfixable, etc.

There thousands Americans right NEVER get back lives due long term effects suffering. People dependent oxygen concentrators portable tanks rest lives simply cannot breathe adequately anymore.

People go dialysis every day eventually die kidneys destroyed.

People never walk able form complete sentences brain doesn’t function fully anymore. People dependent feeding tubes rest lives, people need constant 24/7 care suffered debilitating strokes. People lost every dime trying save homes loved ones, including healthcare workers.

And last least, people PERSONALLY worked alongside lost lives virus, either bodies simply could defeat it, mental physical toll took took life.

I’ve known doctors, nurses, respiratory therapists,medics, EMT’s gave EVERYTHING height help told virus wasn’t real hoax government conspiracy control people. 

I’ve personally random people challenge validity virus, virus saw destroy homes families communities local businesses. invalidated work many healthcare workers across country, almost spitting directly faces.

So may bullets whizzing past heads bombs dropped us, STILL FOUGHT.

So please, take consideration think perspective damndest help stop spread save others suffering many people endured.

Like said, wasn’t war, sure fuck felt like it.

Have good day. I’m sorry full negative emotions! worrying UK mostly world. using Reddit upvotes/downvotes barometer popularity genuinely wish best What's alternative?

Right. people vaccinated yet often even care virus so. are. Yeah really care choose get vaccine get sick.

It's fucking free walk Walgreens. What's vaccine passport? distributes them? vets them? enforces people comply? prevents fakes?

Creating state IDs bars huge expensive process people still get around comically easily. rely vaccine passports safety might well light money fire instead.

That's said cost benefit analysis. think cost passports high there's meaningful benefit it. downvotes say otherwise lol   Sure, comment responded explicitly said “after vaccination,” implying vaccines effective Delta. are.   ask question answer? sacrifice require people show vaccine passports going workplace restaurant? already check ID's bars make sure age, like huge burden check vaccine ID too. one saying shut require masks distancing again. let people places like restaurants, workplaces, gyms without vaccine passport. It’s though, closed borders strict quarantine rules. We’ve one minor ‘outbreak’ community cases result.
From outside looking see could jealous sorry mean vulnerable?"
