If goal ""wear 100 days continue after"", point?  That‚Äôs easily solvable problem heard raised whole pandemic. came specifically post that. seems odd complain something saved countless lives last year. don‚Äôt like wearing mask, either, own. don‚Äôt like pineapple pizza, I‚Äôm going assume problems. give let virus continue community spread among unvaccinated, making necessary whole population responsible people keep getting vaccinated every year? end result inevitable slide annual vaccination rates eventually get another pandemic magnitude. can‚Äôt let vaccine holdouts destroy future.

Specifically, would make vaccines look bad since start acting riskily shows positive negative.

But yeah, antibody test affect immunity all. going safety measures cases get level. Deaths far lower obviously expectations changed year ago. Okay like y'all know big reason masks Asia air pollution, right? It‚Äôs way higher: [Worldwide COVID-19 Total Death Cases 104,774,652 people fully vaccinated Sunday. They‚Äôll back normal soon. anti-vaccination people who, ironically, also opposed lock downs better thank pro-vaccine majority. yeah point people refuse get vaccine that‚Äôs right accept consequences Different reaction vaccines normal mean anything [Worldwide COVID-19 Total Death Cases would make movement spread tbh dont disagree, theres political protect getting others vaccinated, thats  post removed cannot verify reliable source.

I think anything protection level however. real world data 90% way 10% people take shot mild side effects Thank Proportionally, United States would need see 468 new cases day. saw around 100 times yesterday. Israel accomplished amazing. People WANT get vaccine, absolutely able get vaccine, excuse.

For antivaxxers there: get sick die, that‚Äôs you. making/funding vaccines themselves, apparently. least efficiently. Biologically, necessarily legally. Yeah that's good. side effects fun got vaccine even realize put started problems realize actually vaccinated lol. feel I‚Äôm going wait around them. take necessary precautions I‚Äôm waiting select anymore. Got J&amp;J two days ago. side effects whatsoever. 10/10 experience, pretty relieved excited closer worry Early 30s, sick (fever, chills, aches, nausea, diarrhea) 4 days. Even passionately believed cause, see point anymore. Even movement gradually grew grew put huge pressure government... vaccines lifted lockdowns long happens, making movement redundant. kids get vaccinated lol, currently aren‚Äôt 200m eligible people also want vaccine  Oh terrovaxxor reading WAY much this. presenting anything fact.

I wondering physiological difference taking NSIDs analgesics prior vaccine preventative taking getting vaccinated preventative. Neither literature anythi g presented points specifics point. 

If info, please share it. Better yet trained medical professional answer that, would appreciated. early January, averaging 8600 cases per day. 72 cases per day. Israel, however, wouldn‚Äôt vaccinate people already COVID, it‚Äôs natural immunity + vaccinations. US, get vaccinated even already COVID, there‚Äôs overlap, meaning less total immunity. Stay strong. tiny sting small price pay salvation. F them. We‚Äôve done part mitigate virus ‚Äî need booster shots, I‚Äôm happy get them, they‚Äôll commonplace won‚Äôt big deal, like getting yearly flu shot. CHOOSE get vaccine, get sick possibly die? that‚Äôs them. NZer I'm glad hear they're border. fired? [Possibly - maybe could relocated. However given we've number issues border workers / security guards quarantine facilities, there's global pandemic makes wonder refuse vaccine reasonable risk exposed Covid-19. Pfizer #2 past Thursday side effects very, thankful could fix distribution almost instantly allowing labs outside US produce vaccine. Doesn‚Äôt require donations. holding information hostage shouldn‚Äôt rewarded texted response friend grew trailer communities. said opinion trailer trash laughed.  Yeah hate mocking terrible initial covid response, come begging vaccines. Good. think well need booster shot chose comment lol, real genius ü§£ also shows need J&amp;J one shot. makes road shows much easier it‚Äôs one done also due storage requirements People chose get vaccinated nothing worry immune. People refuse get vaccinated immune get virus small number die rest develop natural immunity. well, small segment population physically cant get vaccinated allergies issues immune systems, holdouts fucking things folks reason delay? , honestly thought us assholes wanted keep complete set vaccines share pfizer others , person register since january still didnt get vaccine , f Upvo‚Äî

*wait* I'm talking Texans vacationing MA. lot ""discovered"" cape last year seem come back. also tend ones causing trouble covid restrictions, something tells we'll see overlap antivaxxers would say praising Bill Gates, rather help global vaccine distribution Average redditor shit right here. Good lord  Yep, felt nothing expect slightly sore arm, mom dad couple co-workers. It‚Äôs over. NYC buzzing weeks. last two weekends every restaurant indoors outdoors packed. entire circle acquaintances know 1 person isn‚Äôt yet vaccinated. Seriously, it‚Äôs incredibly happened there!

Their 7 day rolling average 95%.  Sure üëç lol That's hope Lmao what?  I‚Äôm saying people able live lives happily. Acting swiftly aggressively works commun ity spread started yet. can't compare country small vietnam population difference greater 200 million ignorant. US states like mini countries, much spread vietnam.

What's population density difference america vietnam know much? know much would understand pop density plays big role, mention population general, almost fives times Vietnam population seem think two similar enough compare. Ha. Even poorest american much better poorest vietnamese call congressman personally ask him

I know man, provided 3 articles statement someone political party president criticising him. still unsure facts research Damn, need calm subscribe button spam, could even get video. think going help? whole state make 50%. Covid remain background levels immunity vaccine natural infection starts wear off. Every time new booster shot required keep immunity strong, less 50% got fully vaccinated first time around receive boosters. 5 10 years community levels protection fall certain point Covid come back. Seems like health insurance companies point tack extra premium policy holders get vaccinated. would show employer's insurance programs employee's co-pays. people want vaccinated, fine. cost unvaccinated longer socialized among immunized. Yeah definitely. zip code south Seattle 67% first dose of‚Ä¶ whenever checked, days ago.

Even goddamn Vashon 75%! Bill Gates used money set parallel structure inside protect pharma IP waivers trade agreements would allow countries manufacture vaccines. He‚Äôs directly responsible untold deaths could‚Äôve prevented vaccinations, sake making money people like himself, already rich beyond one hand - initial reports new us variant without detail vaccine effective? Sure, hunker bit figure effective vaccines vs. variant. effective go day, take reasonable precaution. That's pretty logical.

On hand - US media aggressive variants needs chill. CDC needs tweak messaging less ambiguous/spinable (even though kinda counter role). hate particularly unusual period first vaccine dose (my period started day got vaccine stopped since. lighter normal gradually gotten heavier. It'll three full weeks Wednesday üò©) feel like can't actually talk others /seek advice without sounding like nut! :( 

Before reading people's responses Twitter &amp; feeling better alone pretty confident it'd clear annoyance meantime, feel like anyone worth listening drowned bunch people making shit &amp; feel isolated. thought it, didn‚Äôt want go rabbit hole. Anti-vaxxers make blood boil. source? don‚Äôt remember maybe it‚Äôs tied vaccines forgot it.  slightly concerned drop rate seems slowing. It‚Äôs truth tho lol  It‚Äôs kid gloves. Meaning soft gloves made soft leather baby goats, etc.

It means delicate treatment. ""More to"". well aware factor here. one would say impactful? 

After all, even Japanese government 100% competent (which government is) limit many vaccines get once.  guess I've noticed shift. used see 'America, we're worried you' non-Americans. seems predominant Americans saying, 'oh shit, insanely disinformed people country, too?!' Three week? mean year right? rock something don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs scarier - fact government effectively forcing people get vaccines, fact redditors actually happy this. rarely wear masks live. Mine made wait 15min dose check reaction occurring way avoid problem make vaccine compulsory. hate say it, people able get vaccine choose to, that's reality. They've chosen potentially harm kill unable protect themselves. believe latter impact former?   bet almost directly correlate education.  Chartered right free movement Canada. political limit movement, especially within province. That's we're predominantly using mobile programs, include non-captive migratory populations (homeless, undocumented, etc). J&amp;J correct shot lot communities. I'm hoping announces something like end mask mandate 70% adults vaccinated something akin that. Something gives everyone solid concrete number work towards tangible reward end it. Guarantee it'll get people fence go get vaccinated.

I got second shot last week relief. week I'll go visit family that's fully vaccinated. can't wait. Vaccines 100% effective, everyone vaccinated yet.

I remember trump said afford destroy economy supply chains issuing strict indefinite federal lockdown reddit went insane rage. are, advocating sacrificing lives want party travel.

What ride. live here?  Probably allergies. 5.7 cut number half two doses.  parents almost fully vaccinated scared they'll get indian virus somehow (in USA) even though protected vaccine... scared never leave house. much.  say rural India getting hammered right now. really think rural parts South could get hammered one infectious variants gains foothold. hate we're getting close either demand unclear constraint. inevitable, sad. I'm glad state's immediate neighbors still happy side chart. use temporary travel restrictions area. It‚Äôs necessary full lockdown everywhere. limit travel hard hit areas vaccinate everyone. People live outside hotspots don‚Äôt need restrictions, aside maybe travel. virus shown thrives urban infrastructure high population density.

Every virus infectious disease thrives situation rofl.  saw interesting post r/coronaviruswa broke infection rates King County zip code - seems mostly south/east county driving infections. Mississippi votes fuck every election. get ask for. got mine yesterday boy felt like shit day that's better getting covid! Kids can't get vaccinated people autoimmune diseases can't either...those anti vaxxers kill people choice get vaccine. agree statement mostly two cases one get vaccinated one never... neighbor south: killing it, keep up. may even get temporary reprieve called massholes lol. forget ever increasingly tragic backstory, like parents left born. New Jersey first US state statewide mask mandate pandemic. yet, day, never seen police officer NJ wear mask.

In US, unfortunately, partisan ideology greatest predictor seriously someone takes COVID adhere mitigation measures. current political landscape, vast majority police officers, gone leaning right fully dug in, whole castle moat.

So completely unsurprising US police relatively low COVID vaccination rate.

Mandating one way go. article says, that's fight lot leaders want get into.

I'd interested know Hawaii got high vaccination rate (80%!) police force, though. Maybe whatever strategies used replicated places.  96% chance happens somewhere else world.

Probably even higher given levels vaccinations US compared rest world. CT LOT work cities. Towns skew wealthy educated absolutely killing (many 100% 65+, 70% total population least one dose), cities immediate ""suburbs"" (which quite urban) seeing much slower uptake. unfortunate reality wealth disparity Connecticut enormous, vaccine uptake predictably follows (see suburbs well below).

**Wealthy suburbs 50% uptake:** 
West Hartford 
Fairfield 
Middlebury   NH huge increase first doses last couple weeks people gotten second dose yet. like 10 KN95s like im sure many others point, think i'm going throw away? reason wear 6 months now. sick 13 months i'm going keep streak alive. Yeah, every place low vaccination rates get hit element chance maybe antibodies previous outbreaks. 

I‚Äôm slowing accepting Tennessee, live, probably never going hit herd immunity throughout state. Imagine committed idea crime committed enough actually learn about. cases response lower testing, actual case count. Testing pointless start due failure test. 

Mortality/hospitalization indicator US transmission. Maybe true. wish could know demographics reddit without confessing anything personal. Right question ‚Äúwhen fully vaccinated?‚Äù answer 2 weeks 2nd dose (according CDC) Ironically opening dates completely flipped haha. set open 8/1 Boston around Labor Day south already open. Maybe push forward Boston made pretty clear opening 3 weeks rest state. Given NYC making Gov. look pretty dumb expect state move 7/1 means late July Boston. Good strategy buuut there's also political reason behind that.

More good vaccines needed. Less circus, facts :) Except people vaccinated see encourages same. chill bit, partybro. Here. conversation someone scary long term side effects of....the vaccine. King County weird. Vaccination rates extremely high mass vaccination sites constantly busy yet we‚Äôre roll back phase 2 tomorrow :-( [47% WA one dose. took Israel two weeks hitting 50% cases started plummet. almost there. Second Pfizer shot, 8 hours later woke shivering, breathing heavy, put sweater went back bed. Woke slight headache sore arm. day, got winded somewhat easily badly. Second day in, later evening feel pretty much fine. Fastest set symptoms I‚Äôve gone through. wife worse symptoms (arm), felt warm, managed run next day. There's nothing vaccine left week two taken it.

When tried sign one trials, line said something like ""being trial prevent getting another vaccine later."" thinking effective could get another. are.   I‚Äôd bet lot already consider immune.  guys I‚Äôm going cry, amazing. Wasn‚Äôt sure if/when we‚Äôd see sort news beginning. Hell yeah fairness Mississippi winner ""last"" lot categories. sad means working harder country try ""fix"" broken there. super heavy lift. South overall embarrassing.   say leanings horseshoe, beliefs convictions come closer together left/right go. become clear said socioeconomic status, although driven wildly different factors.

Many states failed, lot ways, properly message demographics. people fully understand get vaccine (well educated, etc). cannot hold folks we're talking 100% blameless, much system failed them. political. Bad bot. wondered that‚Äôs happening Michigan. much locked states couldn‚Äôt hold forever. spike *will* occur unless there‚Äôs herd immunity. article Politifact summarizes validates lot (including CDC big one ""for COVID-19, hospitalization rate 6 per 100,000 children ages 5 17, CDC says."" flu, 39.2 per 100K.

I February. Sending kids back best thing them.  average 55% Netherlands modal income around ‚Ç¨35k. Excluding houses people can't afford modal income.

[I hope google translate idea talking about. Imagine Japan plan hold Olympics, could done much better covid. many people needing vaccination asap saying athletes prioritised people entertainment. bet don‚Äôt even know Japanese gov putting much money Olympics measures covid. priority already fucked hard, what‚Äôs reason even fuck harder? wonder 65-74 numbers exceeding 75+... true 6 weeks THANK YOU! embarrassed immature many adults little mask. pathetic! 1 day could mean reporting issue. doesnt mean tomorrow like 500 deaths something ridiculous, trends matter 1 day. scale 1 10, say like 4 job would fine. border worker? first point contact people carrying viruses. would warned several times. Possibly given time find new jobs. peaceful transition. problem take hospital resources. hospitals could refuse service people make terrible health decisions US would probably lot healthier. Nope, that‚Äôs wrong. 

Source: used live Japan, air pollution town, lots masks still, worn sick people. Thanks, good know.

The 6 per 100,000 summer total number deaths 0-17 90. number 471 hospitalization rate new number would give rate 31.4 per 100K. less flu - without fully opening up. 

It seems serious illness rates ballpark, I'm sure Covid 19 less deadly flu. addressing people's behavior minuscule part. Keep mind. second year, industries sectors totally partially closed. Small businesses closed, tourism serious trouble, plane travel. People can't work, depth rising. never printed much money year. NEVER. Stock market properties skyrocketing cheap money finding easiest profit-making schemes. European countries e-commerce habit US Amazon. people consume. Import, export raw materials, goods delayed. Etc, etc. N95 good, others similar extremely good filtration -- KN95 KF-94 similar standard N95 quite bit cheaper. favorite BOTN brand KF-94, high quality comfortable. I've seen mask testers test many brands sophisticated equipment youtube showing real deal, high filtration. mask elastic, instead earloops, need something pull tighter better seal (no seal = filtration masks). Get mask ""ear saver"" Amazon pull mask bit tighter. I‚Äôm sick. wouldn‚Äôt I? Asians years. Masks quickly becoming new polar-opposite version certain hat associated certain President.  posts get made almost every day truly don‚Äôt understand. get emotionally attached people do? Idgaf people wear masks even now. ‚ÄúIn case,‚Äù said Napoleon, ‚Äúlet us wait twenty minutes; enemy making false movement must take good care interrupt Canadian California. flew weeks ago got first Pfizer shot, super easy. even able pick vaccine wanted location preferred! one really know levels natural immunity states have. Yeah Bill Gates gives money he's made vaccines. Also, paid vaccines taxes. free.  Bill Gates asking peasants pocket change everything new low. KF-94 (a Korean standard) quite good, medical professionals use. KN95 (a Chinese standard) also good, using many many brands KF-94 KN95 past year+, feel KN95 quality varies quite bit more. KF-94 usually really nice. FFP2 European standard, I've never tried one. fairly equivalent N95. chances variants popping increases let infection spread unchecked seems. spread, mutations higher chance dangerous variants. give IP help raw materials quality control. things mutually exclusive. Well could regions multiple counties. states that. see difference article four months old, one third pandemic ago. smart delay 2nd shots. wish US done that. Moderna decided meet US's demands first S. Korea pushed ranks.

That's exactly part meant. part well December, Korean government saying secured ""plenty"" vaccines, fact signed single contract. 

Also, apparently norm sign contracts vaccines final approval, actual payment based approved. way end bottom list. 

I suspect really happened Korean government fantasies Korea producing selling vaccine, delayed buying vaccines. Ah yes. Moderna Pfizer saline I‚Äôm sure curevac. Good point. praising Bill Gates distracting people massive profits made human suffering. CDC estimates 25-40% US contracted COVID, would massive number natural immunity top total vaccinated. annoying video. Sweden's economic problems caused largely economics countries' lockdowns. Problems international trades, import, export, tourism, information warfare Sweden country kills people. live neighbor Sweden. People visit country can't believe mandate masks. People carry lives stressing. shops open. could true placebo saline, placebo different vaccine (not Covid). weird shots affect people differently. Glad immunized now.  Unpopular opinion, going need carrot get fence vaccinate. Something dangle front them. money, maybe mask free shopping travel certain areas without needing test, something. know everyone saying... want good humanity. Dude, lived earth long? lol course meant HIPAA. yeah company probably cautious disclaimer, promise there. trial intending poison data unblinding antibody test? whole world counting important results trials. trials work comparing two groups demographically similar, randomized blinded therefore behave statistically (because people know got placebo). get antibody test, inform Curevac first want drop trial. visited last year, Hobbiton looked mostly uninhabited. that‚Äôs probably good option. Yes, recently. Michigan. It‚Äôs infecting whole classrooms one two kids table  modest award üôÇ meant Canada mercy vaccine producers politics. producer promises delivery, mean vaccines actually delivered, delivered promised.

Canada really well, vaccination-wise, early on, ground stop deliveries basically stopped. contracts delivery, deliveries never came, either factories producing enough, factories prohibited local governments exporting vaccines. vaccinations continued rate/schedule beginning, entire country would already vaccinated. complaint, observation Lockdowns economic meltdown causes serious public health problems. People going ICU, drinking, rising poverty etc. covid deaths.
Imagine. If, without virus would kind economic crisis lockdowns mental warfare. People stopped going hospital, ICU, excess drinking, depression, stress. much would kill people? got goosebumps teary-eyed. hope America country reach 70% adults fully vaccinated. Take anti-vaxxers. Optimism? allow around here! True, surveillance data show widespread outside densely populated parts East Coast. Fewer deaths despite lower cases first wave likely reflective increased testing capacity, likely also lower viral loads among transmitting masks distancing reducing even along treatment progress. Nevertheless even minority actual cases ever detected reported CDC still estimating around 4-5 unreported cases reported, largely half cases completely asymptomatic. make difficult determine level vaccine coverage needed, along many factors.

It must nice get amazed easily though. True take look what‚Äôs happening India right get sense ‚Äúus guys‚Äù trying avoid. several good articles current top posts sub.  
 
the main point lockdowns, masking, etc along keep health system overwhelmed. breaks down, people would lived they‚Äôd able get treatment start die needlessly - often young, otherwise healthy people, case India. It‚Äôs horror show right say something somewhat similar could happened would wrong: NYC last spring LA winter teetering edge, held together hurt get Covid test. necessarily due store visit shot. shortest possible incubation period 2 days exposure, sounds like cough started right away. Covid, probably exposed earlier. Good luck. wonder many people countries VPN US servers, region locked things can't access, ""default"" them? 16% today's *confirmed* new cases.* kidding think catching even small fraction cases throughout third world. tries make politics choosing vaccine process  **I'm picture** like Since early 2020, Japan's Covid response mostly designed around pretending spreading Japan order cancel 2020 Olympics (by testing people possible, especially testing dead bodies, rely public wear masks social distance). go well, yet never changed course, still undertest huge degree compared countries. still difficult get test there. Vaccination, I'm sure lag much. Olympics aren‚Äôt sacrificing Japanese lives, people choosing gather unvaccinated are. You‚Äôre acting like personal responsibility doesn‚Äôt exist. US home 20% confirmed Covid cases throughout pandemic. Today US 50,000 cases world recorded 822,000 cases. US responsible 16% today's new cases worldwide. Sounds like you‚Äôre excessively taking bunch drugs ... benzos? sleep? Jfc medical history background checks vaccine?  Here's two cents. able get vaccine turn down, health responsibility. refuse get vaccinated, you, live restrictions personally safe. efficacy vaccines extremely high even variants year millions cases mutate.  Based vaccinepilled. Nice work NZ.   Perhaps meant ‚Äúpublic health crisis‚Äù instead  tagged China least East Asia?  Nice. Single dose.   Best wishes man. hope India gets soon. Take care, fine. People follow rules need mental breakdown. People follow rules, care scaremongering. China style lockdown NOW, half measures people DIE. Everyone high risk category (""2. Priorit√§t hohes Risiko"") eligible. secondary prioritisation within groups. case friend written statement she/he 2nd Prio friend make appointment right away vaccination centers.

I already made appointments relatives 3rd prio (not open every Bundesland) already shot someone 3rd prio... high risk eligible 2 months now... hope US soon start exporting countries / poorer countries. even ask insurance info. nothing said price/cost. showed up, lined up, gave names address, got shot, waited 15 minutes, left. thus it‚Äôs okay sacrifice Japanese people could saved, sake entertainment, great idea agree! Brown said expects current restrictions last one three weeks -- ending OHSU‚Äôs forecast predicts Oregon peak 473 hospitalized patients May 22. 2020, COVID-19 actually #1 killer police officers nationally. can't one whose first thought ""what hell electrical energy COVID""? Banning flights India **very** different banning citizens returning home. I'm aware several countries temporarily banning visitors India (or countries throughout pandemic). Countries allowing citizens return home? aware countries this. countries, constitutionally possible. 

I'm denying controlling flights hotspots merit; important delicate job. think making people essentially stateless incredibly consequential dangerous move think better alternatives. oh saying large crowds good idea; saying virulent mutant strain could popped anywhere cause problems. people already covid recovered. around someone else tested positive, give someone hasn‚Äôt yet? findings aren‚Äôt entirely surprise, paper provides clear confirmation detailed explanation mechanism protein damages vascular cells first time. There‚Äôs growing consensus SARS-CoV-2 affects vascular system, exactly understood. Similarly, scientists studying coronaviruses long suspected spike protein contributed damaging vascular endothelial cells, first time process documented. ""Indian-Canadian doctor wants vaccines home country""

Would better title. It‚Äôs still hard accept people really brain dead stupid, are. raise children. marriages. jobs. can‚Äôt complex thinking. wow.  Natural immunity Covid may short lived. could well reporting. Several friends fell sick around end February tested COVID, times, always negative. wondered virus could go restrictions precautions. think flu however. Ahh nights Liverpool non-pandemic times mad, imagine one ones future gonna be! huge shortage supply

Vaccines probably one cost effective public health expenditures is. much money world spent responding outbreaks? Even China, much money spend building big field hospitals 10 days, testing entire cities millions people within days finding cases. 

By giving people cheap vaccines decrease number cases save load money ICU beds, years long covid related morbidities, related health costs. Long-term muscle soreness unheard shots. still bothering long, though, get checked out. 


But, someone nerve damage tetanus shot many years ago (permanent, palm-sized dead spot feeling hip), trust me, advantages vaccine much higher inconvenience weird feeling. Even permanent one, like me.

Sweden donates one million Astra doses Covax

Sweden plans donate one million doses Astra Zeneca's corona vaccine Covax, international collaboration help urgent need vaccines worldwide. news announced Minister Development Aid Per Olsson Fridh (MP) SVT's Morgonstudion Monday.
- need everything meet pandemic, says.

Due serious situation India, vaccine deliveries global Covax vaccine collaboration delayed.

That Sweden donating one million doses international initiative deliver vaccines covid-19 low-income countries free charge.

- see pandemic raging around world. People dying, poverty spreading children still back school. need everything meet pandemic, fight world, says Minister Development Aid Per Olsson Fridh Morgonstudion.

He believes time ""sit hold doses"". Minister Development Aid previously said wants Sweden donate vaccines soon Swedish risk groups vaccinated.

- Sweden already leading financier Covax collaboration, also go million doses ensure people world get vaccines quickly.

Does affect Sweden's vaccination rate
Just like money donated far collaboration, vaccine donation financed development assistance budget. Per Olsson Fridh also says may donations later.

To countries doses sent currently unclear. 92 aid-financed countries receive vaccines Covax, World Health Organization, WHO, Covax decide detail countries receive them.

The fact Sweden donates Astra vaccines affect national vaccination work, according Sweden's vaccine coordinator Richard Bergstr√∂m.

- received Astra Zeneca 65 now, recently, coming weeks take necessary doses get done, dose two need it, says Bergstr√∂m Morgonstudion.

- million, actually four five more, Astra Zenecas vaccines share later.  one wants it, somebody gets it. Hopefully lower data Germany EU countries.

Honestly, German decision restrict age seems inconsistent. surprised Germany increase age limit data collected.  Like supplied vaccines differed significantly samples submitted negotiations. 

If say confidence , trouble listing differences, you? I‚Äôm grocery store worker honestly it‚Äôs big deal. Never deal abusive customers work I‚Äôd without pandemic.

Second, media complains people want get vaccinated, spent long reporting JNJ insanely rare blood clots? fear monger that, government pulls bit, makes people fence solidify view get vaccine.

Now, they're basically reporting BS defeatism. REPORT GOOD NEWS. swear God people want worst happen never end. don‚Äôt really get it. they‚Äôre saying eradication impossible. shit. one said wasn‚Äôt. still get measles outbreaks yearly, herd immunity hinders becoming epidemic.

That's problem right there. U.S. 44% vaccination rate, places like Alabama struggling get 25%. 70% feels unattainable.  wish way could find well. I'm pretty sure there's causality people skeptical getting vaccine people staunchly anti-vax getting it. 

Problem is, anyone skeptical labeled anti-vax. That's bad messaging.

I'm skeptic, still got vaccine.

I'm pretty sure schools require vaccines becomes possible, long-established thing vaccines. trend already begun colleges, also long-established history requiring vaccines.

Not sure workplaces, here's hoping.  Wow... got J&amp;J 2 months ago died yet. Idk understand wanting get science right stopping J&amp;J 6 cases blood clots millions doses seems like incredibly high bar.

How many people die fall 2021 get access vaccine? 6, presumably.

I'd understand concern ""peacetime"" pandemic happening right now.  getting vaccine, dialing use hand sanitizers? 

I never really used cause dry skin seemed kind overkill.

Now I'm fully vaccinated, I'm thinking return that? still wash hands come home but. Testing negative home mean negative time entry. can‚Äôt test way this. Trump‚Äôs White House tried that.   know lot people sub think get yearly covid deaths yearly flu level deaths without restrictions would win. seem forget normal year might lose 50,000 people flu getting covid 50,000 deaths year stop flu deaths. would losing 100,000 plus people US year contagious respiratory diseases. people arrested arrests Sunday mainly offences carrying fireworks weapons, spokesman city council told AT5.

I'm surprised still on. good time thousands needing hospitalization. reprehensible, opinion.

\#1: think country ever ban citizens entering home country. Submit quarantine needed, shut door them.

\#2: Sure, cases India high, per capita counts much higher US Europe, yet Australian citizens coming countries banned returning home. That's hilarious! started attacking blanket statements using blanket statement. started attacking incivility comment got removed breaking civility rules! turns blanket statement use term ""antivaxxer"" describe people are... anti vaccination, can't assume everyone vaccination is... vaccination!? mean... really? term even pejorative - descriptive. end even blanket statement effectively: ""Everyone uses term antivaxxer guilty hatred unfairness prejudice...""

There's nothing wrong that. are, case, part anti-vaccine movement, seem least unreasonable even pejorative call antivaxxer. I'm mean... that's word describe something.

But ever since came home, still feel right eating inside packed. I'm willing accept without trying everything possibly increase demand. ideas things federal, state, local governments increase demand:

1. Start nationwide advertising campaign targeting demographics likely vaccinated educating benefits;
2. Offer perks people get vaccine. I'm thinking $50 $100 gift card places like Target, Walmart, grocery stores, etc. would get lot people fence vaccinated;
3. Work local religious community leaders encourage people community get vaccine;
4. Make requirement vaccinated travel airplane;
5. counting vaccinated people capacity limits.

There lot things done done get many people vaccinated possible. ""Almost always"" ""The serious"" mean never none. Wasting time? Pfizer/BioNTech making almost 200M/month EU alone, almost double US production. Getting Curevac mix taken resource producer. 

Curevac quite interesting, especially supposed easy make adapt, even Pfizer Moderna. sounds like agoraphobia/generalized anxiety disorder. got like *way* COVID. Maybe time band camp!!! Likely both. Higher severity could caused seasonality toward end winter (in places still wintery, like Oregon, Colorado, Michigan), severe strains. unproven though.

And that's covid's relatively long incubation period treacherous... cynic also wonders many negative pre-flight tests fakes. plenty anecdotes people countries selling fake test results bucks.  data we're losing 1pp growth per week among 18-49 age ranges. *If* keeps we'll effectively stall 3 weeks 55% 40-49 one dose, 49% 30-39 39% 20-29. might add percent per month nothing significant.

If stall numbers, we'll probably right 60% adult population shot, hard see make much beyond that.

Anyone 20-29 age range, seem right? get less 40% younger population shot? agree 100% extra AZ last week delivered doctors week (today think). yes, taken account. :) guess that's disagree. fully vaccinated means lowered risk substantial amount. That's debatable. trying get risk 0% that's gonna happen. blame people staying home also hope get judged going restaurant 2nd shot. called Pfizer brought someone helped lot! See friend go together.

 Vaccinated go out? rise Covid anxiety syndrome 
 [*By*Rosa 3 May 2021 ‚Ä¢ 6:00am  
 

Renee Watson, healthy 43-year-old, received coronavirus jabs already. Meanwhile, UK Covid infection rate dwindled size vaccinated population swelled. Lockdown easing, pavement cafes beer gardens teeming, life inching back something like normality.

But much Watson, like may suffering ‚Äì greater lesser degree ‚Äì¬†from termed [Covid anxiety Watson, entrepreneur ‚Äúquite risk-taker‚Äù feels far happier playing safe now.

‚ÄúI thought I‚Äôd spring back return keen go restaurants shopping,‚Äù says mother-of-two Oxfordshire. ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôve really wanted all. I‚Äôm still ordering everything online. It‚Äôs like me, it‚Äôs strange: I‚Äôm normally sociable person like going festivals feels like much risk moment.‚Äù

Watson‚Äôs response easing lockdown uncommon, say psychologists. yet known many people affected residual Covid anxiety vaccination, it‚Äôs feared significant minority struggle readjust, especially increased unlocking allows large groups big, crowded events take place again.

While many us enjoying chance socialise travel normally, clinging fearfully safety behaviours enforced upon us pandemic. rational response danger become ‚Äúmaladaptive‚Äù response danger recedes.

It Marcantonio Spada, professor addictive behaviours mental health London South Bank University, Ana Nikƒçeviƒá, psychology professor Kingston University, identified named phenomenon Covid-19 anxiety syndrome.

Early pandemic, hypothesised would number coping behaviours people would adopt relation perceived threat Covid, which, initially helpful, may time become problematic, especially process reintegration. behaviours ‚Äì¬†which may include touching things, avoiding using public transport, worrying, monitoring environment people presence virus ‚Äì¬†could potentially keep us ‚Äústuck‚Äù, suggested.

‚ÄúIn people use coping strategies consistently, excessively, daily, view keep safe, \[it\] may inadvertently ‚Äòlock‚Äô Covid-19-related [fear distress hinder return normal,‚Äù say researchers.

Data collected US UK bears theory. findings suggest greater risk virus prone Covid anxiety syndrome. Spada believes many one five people could struggle return normality, women 40 may particularly affected, since research shown demographic worst hit pandemic psychologically.

It's always possible booster shot needed. point know yet, though far vaccines seem promising effective variants, immunity seems sticking, we'll definitely Pfizer Moderna said vaccines effective 6 months two shots, maybe longer

Probably longer. understand, **every** guidance things like necessarily going conservative. can't say, ""we think it'll work 5+ years"" literally data suggest end needing every year, yes, need think long term effects

No, again, almost certainly not. Even dose every year six months going high enough rate causes long term effect - again, would even work?

New Yorkers use travel Europe summer. Im sure Floridians able to.  research production much globally coordinated efforts people believe thread. yes, country‚Äôs involvement R&amp;D one factor among large group variables determining supply.

To clear, we‚Äôre talking funding, really research production itself. Either way, don‚Äôt think either global sense you‚Äôre talking about. Almost major production steps done US Europe, research. funding also came primarily areas, received doses. don‚Äôt know equitable really countries put money effort develop produce vaccines get disproportionately small number it‚Äôs self-interest high-income countries ensure equitable distribution tackle pandemic globally coordinated manner; mutant strains India, South Africa, Latin America easily spread wreak havoc high-income countries.

It‚Äôs self interest donate excess doses, sure. don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs interest donate doses would use. country choice vaccination 50% population 1% entire world‚Äôs population, former would definitely prevent current deaths covid, latter would marginally reduce potential new strain developing different country.

So varies look (and when). think it‚Äôs vaccines aren‚Äôt dependent body mass like medications are. vaccine needs trigger immune response medications absorbed tissues. mass have, tissue have. immune system isn‚Äôt dependent mass. 5 weeks behind US. Everyone started time, EU blockade exports. Germany particular followed ""vaccine equality"" statements, even though put behind by...well 5 weeks.

Everyone underspending vaccines last summer fall, that's pretty inexcusable wealthy countries. again, Germany leading way there. thought large crowds needed mask outdoors? Unless Halloween parade outdoor concert, think fine. gonna infect people passing one second. Except Olympics going happen...2 months earlier....

And aren‚Äôt even requiring vaccines thousands athletes gather every county world *rolls eyes*

It possible hold events vaccinated people. Popsicle. Grape popsicle. Probably less sugar fun.  ideally dosage tailored every individual (that's future medicine anyway) since that's reality live yet, develop dosage sufficient generate desired immune response nearly people, especially considering different immune responses, body types sizes. Since mRNA vaccines work like traditional vaccines weakened dead forms virus ...

I also kind amazed internal restrictions Australia, too. closed borders states different periods pandemic, Victoria New South Wales least. strictly enforced, too. drive Melbourne months last year. Finland Uusimaa, province includes Helsinki, three weeks year ago. government declared emergency conditions (akin war) using emergency powers legally allowed they're ""absolutely necessary"". blockade lifted early epidemic turned decline government claim necessity more. Australians kept months, way fewer infections had. suppose point - eradicated virus country. Finland, came back soon everyone went back school work August.  Patients Long Covid Face Lingering Worrisome Health Risks, Study Finds

Patients sick enough hospitalized still significantly greater risk dying within six months people infected.

The health effects Covid-19 stretch months appear increase risk death chronic medical conditions, even people never sick enough hospitalized, large new study finds.

In study, published Thursday journal Nature, researchers looked medical records 73,000 people across United States whose coronavirus infections require hospitalization. one six months becoming infected, patients significantly greater risk death ‚Äî 60 percent higher ‚Äî people infected virus.

The research, based records patients Department Veterans Affairs health system, also found nonhospitalized Covid survivors 20 percent greater chance needing outpatient medical care six months people contracted coronavirus.

The Covid survivors experienced vast array long-term medical problems never ‚Äî lung issues respiratory effects virus, symptoms could affect virtually organ system part body, neurological cardiovascular gastrointestinal. also greater risk mental health problems, including anxiety sleep disorders.

‚ÄúWe found all,‚Äù said author study, Dr. Ziyad Al-Aly, chief research development service VA St. Louis Health Care System.

‚ÄúWhat shocking put together like ‚ÄòOh God,‚Äô see scale,‚Äù added. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs still jarring, honestly.‚Äù

What‚Äôs more, patients‚Äô post-Covid medical issues ‚Äî like diabetes, kidney disease heart problems ‚Äî could become chronic conditions would require treatment rest lives.

‚ÄúPeople continued respiratory disease, continued headache, this, next thing,‚Äù said Dr. Laurie Jacobs, chairwoman internal medicine Hackensack University Medical Center, involved study. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs gone away. don‚Äôt yet understand underlying cause, it‚Äôs become chronic cases, disabling cases. areas, people gotten better, it‚Äôs variable.‚Äù

The study believed largest yet evaluate comprehensive array health conditions. non-hospitalized Covid survivors study tested positive virus March 1, 2020, November.

Most nearly 32 million people contracted coronavirus United States needed hospitalization, ways study may applicable wide swath population. Veterans Health System patients study may representative ways, including 88 percent male median age 61. Nearly 25 percent Black, 70 percent white nearly 5 percent races.

Researchers compared risk death characteristics data nearly 5 million patients Veterans system Covid-19 hospitalized time. group median age 67, 90 percent male somewhat larger proportion white patients somewhat smaller proportion Black patients.

Dr. Jacobs said clinic seeing wide range symptoms study. said risk death among study‚Äôs patients considerably higher would expected. ‚ÄúI really shocked number,‚Äù said.

Between one six months experiencing relatively mild moderate infection, 1,672 73,345 patients ‚Äî 2.3 percent ‚Äî died, study reported. indicate caused deaths anything specific patients‚Äô conditions.

The researchers also could say people underlying health conditions whether new symptoms direct effects coronavirus infection, corollary effects medications taking treat symptoms, stress pandemic-related problems influences. Experts said study‚Äôs findings reflect cascade issues driven virus medical system‚Äôs struggle grapple Covid-19 long-term effects.

‚ÄúWe hundreds thousands people unrecognized syndrome trying learn immune response virus changes response immune response include organ systems body,‚Äù said Dr. Eleftherios Mylonakis, chief infectious diseases Brown University‚Äôs Warren Alpert Medical School Lifespan hospitals, involved study. ‚ÄúThe health system made deal something like this.‚Äù

In many cases, Dr. Mylonakis said, people experiencing new symptoms never acutely sick viral infection enter confusing balkanized medical world, seek help primary care doctors referred various specialists try figure treat conditions fall particular area expertise. helps explain study found Covid survivors one-and-a-half times outpatient visits month patients general V.A. population.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre dealing silos,‚Äù Dr. Mylonakis said. ‚ÄúEvery time transfer, something lost. patient loses may make long Covid symptoms worse.‚Äù

For example, ‚Äúif I‚Äôm endocrinologist, I‚Äôm going look blood sugar, I‚Äôm going look 14 systems,‚Äù said. ‚ÄúBut problem blood sugar may person weakness fogginess cannot go supermarket get healthy foods, they‚Äôre going order pizza.‚Äù

Dr. Mylonakis said unified nature Veterans system may actually make better coordinating care sharing patient information among specialists, patients outside system, frustration confusion may add considerable stress aggravates symptoms.

Still, complexity long-term Covid abundantly evident within Veterans system too.

‚ÄúI patients get bed 10 minutes prepare salad can‚Äôt eat they‚Äôre totally exhausted, tired time put small salad together,‚Äù said Dr. Al-Aly.

The research showed Covid survivors also likely taking spectrum medications newly emerged health problems, including opioids, Dr. Al-Aly said concerning might portend another wave opioid addiction problems future.

Dr. Al-Aly co-authors Yan Xie Benjamin Bowe, Washington University St. Louis, also analyzed records 13,654 patients hospitalized initial coronavirus infection. Unsurprisingly, found sickest patients ‚Äî needed intensive care ‚Äî greatest risk long-term complications, followed hospitalized regular wards, followed patients never hospitalized.

Nonetheless, virtually every category symptom ‚Äî chest pain shortness breath diabetes muscle weakness ‚Äî experienced least people never hospitalized.

‚ÄúI would interpret saying ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs everywhere,‚Äô‚Äù Dr. Al-Aly said. ‚ÄúEven stayed home quote-unquote recovered three four days. that‚Äôs important segment really lion‚Äôs share Covid patients. people, get Covid, don‚Äôt get hospitalized.‚Äù

For people hospitalized, experiences involved significantly greater risk long-term health complications people hospitalized seasonal flu, study found. likely develop persistent symptoms wide array categories beyond respiratory manifestations Covid: neurological, cognitive, psychological, cardiovascular, metabolic gastrointestinal, anemia blood clotting problems well fatigue malaise.

Dr. Mylonakis experts noted understanding virus status medical treatment evolving quickly, progress already translating improvement patients. addition, people long Covid gotten better time, either help treatment.

Still, Dr. Al-Aly said: ‚ÄúWhat grapple years come, maybe even decades, effect pandemic long-term health Americans.‚Äù

He added, ‚ÄúWe got caught unprepared Covid. Let‚Äôs drop ball long Covid.‚Äù two effective vaccines 95% 94% effective preventing COVID-19, so, yes, there‚Äôs still small chance infected develop COVID-19. would number call pandemic over? mean never going zero, right? number compare influenca numbers past? heavy spreaders tho that‚Äôs really works. 
Who get infected 3 week extension 25-39 yo, severely ill. far people 50 doesn‚Äôt often die covid, 2 cases now. relatively low infection numbers (and lower get summer) answer probably it‚Äôs right decision yeah got 16YO first shot April vacation second one might screw AP U.S. History exam, might see push second one little bit later that's over. lots later, days. Come Texas. article published recently Nature finds non-hospitalized post COVID-19 patients 59% increased risk mortality within 1-6 months infection. study largest date post COVID-19 patients, comparing 73,435 non-hospitalized patients nearly 5 million controls.

I said think mostly theatrics people saying take masks soon friends bar say ""why fuck still wearing thing"" talking someone company handling COVID last year.

The instant sued so, upper management forced everyone back office declaring ""essential workers."" C-suite people retreated closed offices threatened anyone comfortable open office plan. talked endlessly great plastic dividers installed meeting rooms refusing enforce mask rules.

That person know longer works there. it! Agree. expect Indian government utmost suppress true figure, sadly. Probably get closer 70%.   love wearing mask

I mostly wear mask outside, except crowded show people yelling cheering. mostly wore inside others, except restaurants (and eat inside). would say 10% people wearing masks inside (this Pigeon Forge, TN) doubt wearing vaccinated eh. erm‚Ä¶ got cited sources claims? Afaik Georgia generates engineers. 

Louisiana biggest Trade Port quick google search. 

You‚Äôre spot LAX. need sources though, respectfully. Measles endemic United States. occasional outbreaks due inbound international travelers measles arrive. outbreaks exclusively occur communities low rates vaccination.

I agree waiting ""zero COVID"" silly. take many cycles Rt &lt; 1 get zero. fastest, easiest way get zero COVID even without restrictions high vaccination uptake. 1. Date vaccination.
2. Type vaccination (to capture new vaccines future variants).
3. Medical reasons vaccine could given (allergies).
4. Social security number.
5. Probably also contact details regular healthcare providers.

Then, ask additional information could extracted digital pass:

1. check-in venue passport person attending.
  1. (social graph due co-attending nearness time)
2. revaccination.
3. Number people attending venues.

Even company *saying* things, mean malicious party could extract information security well maintained.

And list thinking problem 5 minutes. Ask smart corporate executive background Data Strategy could think of. miss normal life we‚Äôre two years more, simply validates things never go away. 

Also lot international travel. idea 10hr+ plane ride mask unpleasant. It‚Äôs Italy, they‚Äôll 3 years likely die car accident way getting vaccinated, know sane person would think better idea vaccinated. drop summer, next winter still going big question mark low vacination states.

There anything like last winter, things could get dicy awful, can't take eyes uniform.

India isn‚Äôt good enough example new variants idk else say. Right, maybe someone heard news report science done determine degree vaccinated vs. unvaccinated person could carry &amp; spread virus mentioned measuring viral shed; knowing/understanding science pre-existing distrust vaccines, mind held vaccinated people might shed virus. One game politics-inflated Telephone later, pundits reporting wild misunderstanding frightening (to uninformed) way.

I hate it, see path may led people there, wish weren‚Äôt point independent intellectual curiosity trust experts widely degraded politics. Pathetic really.

It‚Äôs big deal. already show id and/or tickets go events. got first dose 3 hours away county vaccinating everyone m. time dose #2 open appointments easy get. called cancel original got miles away.

So, yes, can. make sure cancel original appointment. Cognitive dissonance powerful. Doubly offered many avenues protect (especially vaccines). 

To acknowledge COVID real hospitalized would make hospitalization (mostly) fault also shattering part identity. one wants accept lash order protect already fragile (due stress hypoxia) mental state. not. saying nothing better would happen releasing IP, lots potential negatives. it‚Äôs hobby horse lot people grew big mad big mean music companies wouldn‚Äôt let download music, IP law must bullshit uninformed opinions. pfizer #2 past Wednesday side effect dead arm. Everyone seems wildly different reaction. benefit greatly geopolitical perspective.

Currently countries south america depend russia‚Äôs china‚Äôs vaccine could regain lost ground vaccine deals Vaccine passports set dangerous precedent variety reasons:

1. leads social segregation refuse take vaccin, refuse share knowledge whether taken vaccin. social segregation leads compulsion. think careful forcing people take certain medicine. Even believe (like me) current vaccines mostly harmless, effectively lose ability make well informed personal decision safety effectivity vaccines obliged take, lest want participate normal society. 
2. PII medical information needs shared, previously protected strict rules. Yes, say Name/DOB True/False, that's entirely true. can't take vaccin, due medical reasons, also noted. Later would get whole list possible vaccins taken throughout life, possibly new variants COVID well. stop COVID? take anti-psychosis medicine? psychiatric background? take flu-shot? might seem far-fetched, actually appears marketing materials vendors selling technology vaccine passports. 
3. vaccine passports (in general) managed government. private parties collecting medical information.  Same. Forced back office already going insane.  What, mean reasonable want either lockdown lasts 2023 tens millions deaths?

I'll take chances vaccine pretty much eradicates virus minimal side effects. worth sacrificing millions lives chance there's sort long term side effect *vaccine*. Especially mRNA vaccine, operates pretty simple principle. Looking forward reddit user posts Sunday's US vaccine count supply vs demand US states. Yeah, understand NH's numbers. Governor S. said we're ahead rest country comes people showing second doses, case I'd expect us higher percentage fully dosed people, going lock-step everything. instead #1 percentage first doses rather low percentage fully dosed. 

That make sense me. Got second dose today.Mentally prepared whatever happens. Lets this!  lot idiots alaska believe threat can‚Äôt killed gun isn‚Äôt really threat. yet keep seeing nutcases Reddit. wonder bad lives COVID seem want us wear masks socially distance forever.  people around since long COVID thing probably know protect themselves, even things like flu common cold devastating consequences immunocompromised.

If there‚Äôs one good thing COVID them, it‚Äôs things like curbside pickup delivery commonplace before, it‚Äôll easier avoid contact people. wear masks public without people looking like two heads.

This initiative isn‚Äôt really GoFundMe buying vaccine doses. It‚Äôs roundabout way help people realize privilege living first world, encourage value vaccines get free enough actually take time get vaccinated.

There‚Äôs big psychological difference ‚Äúalways free everyone‚Äù ‚Äúthis item monetary value, you, specifically, get free take action‚Äù.

Bill Gates isn‚Äôt shit goblin - he‚Äôs trying help solve vaccine hesitancy problem also getting many resources possible COVAX. Central Oregon leading region cases. unfortunate. Le sex joke !! XDdd upvote sir !!!  There's large military base there, requiring vaccines yet (not fully authorized FDA). 

Between friends family various branches, guardsmen I've personally spoken vaccine sites, sounds like minority enlisted soldiers getting vaccinated, basically masking required. Otherwise they're going out, things like pre-covid.

There's way influencing spikes manner.

Combine rural conservative population (statistically least like get vaccinated), got recipe big spike. It‚Äôs share total population gotten least one shot. areas Ontario almost cases prior April 3rd? Even Northern Ontario struggling relatively high cases loads. North Bay come grey March variant outbreak started apartment building, Thunder Bay hundreds active cases due spread mines. Kapsuskasing big outbreak. Algoma okay India variant came back international travel spread though 'last-hurrah' banger Easter spread high schools. places recently started settled comes case count. People tend reactive news day forget took weeks virus ramp ramp down.  Actually BC small travel restriction it‚Äôs legal. It‚Äôs lockdown freaks claim travel can‚Äôt restricted without national lockdown. reality, travel restrictions get lifted longer needed neither desire need lock entire country again, matter much tiny number people living hot spots want punish others failures. I'm sorry, definitely sucks. careful, brutally cold days school daughter choice eat lunch crowded cafeteria, normally would do. We're guessing that's picked up. make matters worse first day back recovering covid one teachers gave detention literally two steps entering classroom bell rang. Realize killing Black Brown people good reason anti-vax. better Chauvin. lol means want encourage it

please think confused ICU beds ventilators, Ontario including GTA country huge surplus ventilators

Sorry dad they're admitting people ICU unless code and/or good prognosis

Even without capacity crunch, many people especially older people admitted prognosis poor taxing body admitted ICU let alone ventilator I'm still trying decide ""category five hurricane"" Walensky's ""impending doom"" take aged worse. examples gave big cities. I'm sure find something affordable less populated areas. Biggest difference France, Germany Italy huge compared Netherlands. Easier find place less densely populated.

The problem Netherlands ""de randstad"", big cities small towns surrounding them. example live town 35.000, mostly people Amsterdam move cheaper Amsterdam, new houses build start ‚Ç¨700.000 200 square meter.

If mind living like 100km Amsterdam still find house small family around 200k.

Crazy, glad got tho! make sense though? says article they‚Äôre negative test thing, also seeing gathering increases transmission. you‚Äôre requiring negative covid test get you‚Äôre going get either zero covid tiny amount false negatives, none matches reality. 

I mean, guess unless UK planning requiring negative covid test go public events. guess it‚Äôd make sense.  Right? It‚Äôs amazing leading competence instead scratching ass pretending everything fine actually garners positive press. degree factor people prior infection equation?

44% vaxed + X% Americans post-infection immunity = total amount people virus can't easily use transmission. know exactly feel last bit there. DAY got eligible vaccine roommate tested positive covid, course already passed time tested positive. always careful, long, close making without getting it, none matters people live aren‚Äôt careful too. It‚Äôs clear part NZ border guards job infect people suppose protect. 

I clue anyone problem this, unless don‚Äôt understand NZ‚Äôs method protecting country infection. Hes never job, dropped school general sense word loser ambition leave. Man child really, living open flat could understand still mommy everything like perfectly capable sad Fire/EMS %'s also abysmally low area. 

Not sure translating across rest country, fire fighters fit categories see vaccinate rates anyway. Sure that‚Äôs Ford Ontario. It‚Äôs thing possible limiting travel illegal Ford hasn‚Äôt done it.

Ontario terrible outbreak part due poor decision making. That‚Äôs reason lockdown places almost cases. Yyyyyyyyyeah buddy! would allowed ACA. heard year. almost assuredly told mistaken regard though.

I know local LEO'S specifically told needed vaccinated regardless previously Covid, explained case.

Even then, even get 50% departments vaccinated. 

The larger issue officers belonged demographics see large refusing get vaccinated. heard there's ""2nd generation"" Pfizer Moderna vaccines coming out. get first dose Pfizer Moderna now, mean I'm longer able get ""2nd generation"" vaccine second dose? so, wait months get vaccine?

Also, studies saying Pfizer much lower effectiveness Asian Americans (I one), like \~70% compared Moderna's \~100%, stat mean vaccine suitable me?

(arguably) lesser extent whole Henrietta Lacks (of HeLa cells fame) debacle. one reason people color may wary vaccination efforts. Really sucks, people color -as well low income whites- disproportionately impacted events like pandemic. Really hoping get master's community health applied work address issues. Host genomics important need POC take part trials get vaccinated general. Obviously anecdotal, everyone know side effects (other arm soreness) 2 nights rest.  slight headache tired today, bad all. seems anything goes narrative open full force.

Glad there‚Äôs still actually looking instead reading headline drawing conclusion want. live anybody call walk get vaccine. sure else I'm supposed waiting on? going guilted made feel bad keyboard activist Indoor federal mandate, even federal mandate outdoor federal land still place. simple.

More deaths = looks bad whoever charge Right? still intend wear mask public health officials say reached herd immunity forego masks. I‚Äôve spent past year taking seriously following guidelines limit spread. I‚Äôm screw we‚Äôre finish line Here's optimistic data point! UK hit 44% first doses (where now) March 25th. day 7 day average cases 5,564. One month later 2,437 yesterday 2,194. Coupling trajectory current solid baseline metrics fact US seasonality tailwinds better UK's (their spring comes pretty late), think awesome place hit pandemic lows cases, hospitalizations deaths end May. 

I surprised look back COVID event significantly impacted American public March 2020 May 2021 ultimately waning far manageable less intrusive disease. Someone another comment mentioned wanted avoid using Moderna extremely high cost compared vaccines. total eligible WA? reason using increased population density better COVID mitigation. Help make make sense. Feeling optimistic. booked vacation August. Figured gives 4 months things improve, plus it‚Äôs end summer break kids starting go back school, hopefully thin things bit. trying say?  never said happening Canada children crisis. words. 

I say happening children Brazil respect COVID-19 crisis. 

But say deaths real. literally kept writing not. 

And called that. 

I Toxicologist. read poison control reports year. 

Even one person dying particular cause still worth noting someone like me. 

And someone worn full face respirators summer, find wearing mask help keep people alive work getting people vaccinated major imposition. 

And sure think happening, people mask quarantined global respiratory virus pandemic supposed do. 

It's grandfather alive. 

And speaking old people.

Dead. word choosing use dead. 

Kids quarantined old people would get dead. 

And let's honest missed freedom lot longer needed whole bunch adults acted selfishly. 

But kids mostly grown ups it. lot actual adults. 

But someone seen small children mask see grandpa MRSA surprise me. 

Look, simple want respect people's right life, come liberty whole declaration independence, go find island. 

But want live society, value people's right live. 

It's let drive sidewalk. 

That true even would teenager driving elderly couple sidewalk. 

Even kids get experience absolute freedom one person's freedom sometimes end another person's freedom begins. 

But hey, confused complete lack human rights looks like, go look modern day slavery. 

And may shock lot us enjoying quite human rights days. 

I even wear mask outside anymore. Facts. Science. Powerful stuff. 

P.S. also give shortcut curing hundreds deadly disease faster. case interested.  Yes we‚Äôre getting like maybe 1% increases per day now. let‚Äôs say 40% realistically wait long hit 70%??? demand low already. certain point becomes unfair wait around people bribed it. Population Vietnam 96 million. population density Saigon NYC. Vietnam also much poorer country borders China. Yet people largely lived COVID free life, treating citizens foreigners coming COVID, contact tracing, testing isolating contain. 

If people knew differently pandemic could played out, left right would demanded better. 

The excuse countries small, different, much like islands US not-- say think harder. Figure next pandemic. needs better 5 countries manage rest world languishes with, example, American exceptionalism German bureaucracy/lockdowns. I'm charge making decision, stating Ontario got here. say easier control movement around Maritimes limited way access province police 200,000 km roads Ontario. I'm Northern Ontario, lockdown probably need based numbers, we've gone 12 cases day less one. helped us look open back couple weeks. imagine colour coded regions implemented look forward green vaccinated.  makes sad? fact adult children take care aging parents? makes sense save money joint family housing? parents get influence grandkids?  I'm beautiful northern neighbor, although I've visited quite bit. 100% correct that's state attempted town/county level lockdowns minute abandoned it. work mobility much thing. difference can't lock state state travel (despite Rhode Island trying it) due constitution.

Folks, like voting you, desperate normalcy. get sucks able things before, get together work together. missing something? CDC huge press release loosened mask restrictions. outdoor masking you‚Äôre vaccinated, long it‚Äôs mass gathering. Lockdowns never made sense poor countries, said people starving them. I'm assuming made since India year.

The idea India needs food makes sense - distancing negate spread comes cost, people still eat. bring politics thwart entire argument. find funny irks you. Pfizer already opened exports Canada produce far doses Moderna. announce snap election (which expected)

Why? would lose seats they? would hold one? also population dense (compared US) makes remarkable I'm thinking lockdowns population natural immunity due infection. Maybe. U.S., might bit longer.

I like people sub like compare U.S. Israel Israel lockdowns vaccine passports vaccinating population. know it‚Äôs funny vaccines becoming available, comments ‚Äúvariants‚Äù ‚Äúmutants‚Äù increased 10 fold sub lol ones getting infected antivax nutjobs. Vaccines available all. american come visit Quebec. disease named inbreeding. Instead sharing methodology utilizing additional labs around world increase production, ol‚Äô Billy Biotech Gatekeeper making sure friends keep IP control production price. man praised THREE LIONS SHIRT thats probably gonna certain states high level vaccinations, natural immunity, adherence safety measures, others Isn‚Äôt copper natural disinfectant? I‚Äôve seen hospitals outside US use copper door handles high touch items. ...and what? you‚Äôre country favor... ok. Indoor dining gyms open throughout covid contributed lot spread - again, something open doesn‚Äôt mean go. I‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs kinda nice masks won‚Äôt get sick even covid. Airports airplanes notorious getting people sick. I've seen families live like that, happy I'd describe it. Nashville here, checked least 40% Davidson county first shot thankfully, unfortunately everyone surrounding counties comes weekends... UK stricter priority order too. seems like lots places US anyone 18 get vaccinated, UK still sticking age groups unless someone health condition works health social care. country allowing fully vaccinated people visit area would logic say go? Especially given areas crushed economically covid lack tourism revenue. think we'd favor going? fail see claiming misinformation reasoning probably better take NSAIDs Ibuprofen really need them.

Your reasoning presented based ""fact"". 

The CDC come multiple ways saying ibuprofen aspirin fine shot. they're useful mild side effects. Multiple doctors nurses I've spoken recommended ibuprofen aspirin afterward they've even taken themselves. 

Your reading based fear first foremost abundance caution second. rooted actual words coming mouths people say trust. suffer medical health anxiety understand coming from, think could try bit even handed say: ""yeah I'm anxious"" rather posts read linked CDC sites links scientific research. That's basing info on. Lol. Asking reopening early half million people died dumb? 

You americans assholes zero empathy. patriotism ends hanging flag. go best douche be! It‚Äôs risk now. problem everyone else vaccine widely available direct impact us. it‚Äôs much less problem since super mRNA others also acquire superpower choose to. double vacinated. I'm sold idea 8 year old getting vacinated year two. see value future people normal cold wear mask days? thinking to. interesting see happens fall winter virus hit brick wall vaccines! true though? still averaging 50k+ new cases day USA. higher case load compared second wave.

50k+ new cases day USA year later still pretty bad.   care? would expect loss efficacy several month period pfizer. Still highly effective severe illness though long time including variants would think It‚Äôs definitely gonna get lol. Rates trending hard + Summer weather likely means things fine summer US. States trended early April also started trend hard well. Ever Asia? 3-5 year olds daycare onboard masks, yeah, relate saying. Every little sniffle ordeal now, although damn sight easier now, close walk-in clinics 15 min tests.

One striking thing many times everyone family got covid, except 3-5 year old. Babies, yes, older kids, yes, younger ones no. know 5 families case. Yes, started March paused things started getting bad he‚Äôs opening again. People impatient. travel different state, I‚Äôm shut luck there‚Äôs cross-verification procedure.  Good. Freedom vaccinate, also freedom get new job. Yeah think right. believe reemerge eventually think going take multiple years Ok, cool. Like say, ton places let travel pandemic - weren‚Äôt looking safety wanted money. impressive. know advanced healthcare system small geographical area contend with, developed countries learn things here. dropping like rock way verify PII checks. That‚Äôs inherent problem. Supercross! want encourage everyone donate. want truly put end virus must defeat globally. link 100 serious cases total entire country. Watching numbers fall Israel last month nothing short incredible. They‚Äôre still administering 5-12k shots day country better nothing. virus effectively defeated there. kids get vaccinated never meaningfully spread again. say it. nothing burger immunity end story chance Gosh you‚Äôre dramatic ü§£ adjusted 1.4 billion thats lot though? horrifying news images??

Something add up. wonder got point believing official covid numbers become hard. That‚Äôs awesome noted good job early less natural immunity population continue wear mask, socially distance, avoid large, indoor crowds now. fine. fact exact reason Washington well they're issues now. Less natural immunity population Walgreens gives COVID vaccines now, couple months. what‚Äôs end goal? People aren‚Äôt going get aren‚Äôt going it‚Äôs ridiculous us responsible year gotten vaccines held back. isn‚Äôt tenable situation. impossible, expect vaccine resistant polio likely though. governors job take input multiple sources make decisions based risk reward. One study OHSU exaggerated results ignored consequences shutdown. February decided vaccinate teachers even school ahead thousands elderly people. made political decision surely cost lives. would guess studies would tell impact. Can't let get everyone vaccinated. variants never serious concern US vaccines. variants probably reduce efficacy bit, likely enough raise reproductive rate 1, means herd immunity stay.

I agree going US soon. Cases exist deaths negligible blend thousands infectious diseases rather king killing hundreds thousands year Canada's problem staff hospital capacity, equipment people aren‚Äôt getting vaccine already treating life normal though guess world ignorance even sarcasm much. Jeez. COVID endemic going away. difference today US, people walk wal-mart appointment get vaccinated basically 100% effective negative impacts COVID. choose to, it‚Äôs assume risk. rest us, life going get back normal pretty fast celebrating miraculous medical achievement. seems anti-vaxxers ought put terror watch list now. I'm sure put anti-abortionists well. groups tend attract single minded individual who, echo chambers internet, likely act violence. reading thinking ‚Äúhow sending abroad there‚Äôs many sick back home?‚Äù Let give perspective B.C. applies B.C wouldn‚Äôt doubt situations similar nationwide. According recent press conference week two ago. B.C bolstered ventilator capacity significantly (almost triple believe). Couple people less sick third wave. (Still hospitalized symptoms less severe). press conference stated still %80 ventilator capacity despite hospitals ICU‚Äôs stressed. we‚Äôre position send machines still significant buffer back home. India needs do, things much dire there. don‚Äôt automatically issue everyone free voter ID effort required turn 18. give people vaccine cards vaccinated, hassle involved.

Edit: also, Covid pandemic real, ongoing public health crisis. Voter fraud functionally never happens levels influence elections, voterID solution problem doesn‚Äôt exist. Weirdly, Reddit still pretty US centric. Oregon here‚Äî we‚Äôre exact boat. Definitely feels weird moment. Thanks reminding nice exit stages life give shit peer pressure. 1. zero problem segregating vaccine refusers participating normal life. don‚Äôt want endanger society whole selfish people. see segregation coercion features. 

2. I‚Äôm really concerned slippery slope, say wouldn‚Äôt mind required vaccinations way require students current. public health benefit fully vaccinated population massive saw danger lapsing heard immunity couple years ago measles outbreaks. 

3. NY running state sponsored pass system. would rather see states (I don‚Äôt care subcontract) makes system much secure. state records vaccinated best position verify vaccine status. Maybe making ton assumptions. August Iceland trip still go Iceland needs proof vaccination. Can‚Äôt believe much people still whining masks. 

13 months ago you‚Äôd told goddamned *masks* would reason people turned toddlers provided thousands hours public-freakout content pandemic, wouldn‚Äôt believed it. 

If told people would still bitching 13 months later, wouldn‚Äôt believed it.

I must missing vital component ego would otherwise cause feel oppressed like less person square paper covering nose mouth.

PS., someone used get cold every goddamned flight, yes, wearing mask using First Defence nasal virus gel (UK product, existed pandemic) flights going forward. strangers want share opinions me, assume lack hobbies, maybe suggest some. Yeah, governor (RI) said health recommendations data change, masks won‚Äôt required K-12 schools fall right they‚Äôre operating assumption be. I‚Äôm hoping college requires vaccination doesn‚Äôt need require masks it, honestly wouldn‚Äôt end world wear months class. Yea idk, 101 million vaccinated, sure number people contracted recovered, also many didn‚Äôt go back second shot whatever reason. WA come ok, think. 

A weeks people careful, it. Perhaps think much would happy pay vaccine got free donate money make sure people get access vaccines Actually scientific background would understand way many variables control study. Masks, distance, capacity, enforcement, on. Let‚Äôs look Oregon. 13 months data shows outbreak restaurants especially workers option vaccinated. outbreaks factories nursing homes churches show study outbreak restaurants. N equal 1. believe nearly 4 million people Utah. Let‚Äôs look Texas too, oh 49 states aren‚Äôt locked right now. sure got science education common sense. Hopefully that's US 2-3 months relative population.  recommend look get home work, gonna take minute get speed work. 

They cells produce antigen, presented immune system responds like real deal, think confusing antibody antigen. probably thinking neutralizing antibodies instead ""antibodies"" water wet line getting old huge regional differences within areas, though. San Francisco Bay Area 70% least 1 dose, example. 

Many large population areas going get herd immunity, freeing hospit resources areas. Moderna basically *can‚Äôt* enforce parents without big stink raised US Federal Government part owners critical patents. Donate here: money raised goes international fund called COVAX AMC, buys COVID-19 vaccines world, prioritizing need countries cannot afford them. I'm calling whole variant thing 'nothing burger' means, seems amounting much far. Vaccinations + natural immunity infection starting really add up. perhaps slightly got ahead variant variable result. Dunno, think within 2 full months, referred 'pandemic' anymore.... also friends owned words, much like names used bully abuse, words really ok coming someone belonging supposed group. friend could use it. shouldn't, opinion someone generally prefers demean people. 

When friend used it, funny. used it, would sounded like jerk. least me, little girl next one over. Well I‚Äôm kinda starting curious best course action enough idiots refuse. then? end need much population vaccinated wouldn‚Äôt see need things. big would like see people refusing vaccine feel lot pressure get it. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

We've pledged aid India, even get government hot water idiotic nationalists country.  may able more.  also like clear here. province par, exceeding India's per capita daily infection rate (granted, REPORTED infection rate).  we're still sending aid. currently vaccines spare. vaccine producer, India purchased vaccines them, I'd hope returned favour interfere export vaccines, don't. complaining SII sending 1 million doses purchased delivered April 500k supposed delivered month.  understandable point.

The vaccines shipped, stored, handled, administered, scheduled (twice!) pharmacies vaccine centers world. Hundeds thousands rushed doses 1,100,000,000 doses administered really *not bad*. CCP lots things critiqued, I'm tired utterly unnuanced circlejerk everytime literally anything chinese mentioned.  happened immune protection already virus?

If vaccinate 70%, half remaining people gotten virus point before, 85%, really, herd immunity.

The cold viruses get around mutating fast enough, far vaccine protection mostly worked new covid variants, insane think naturally developed immune protection similarly broad. seems like natural immunity certainly role play part herd immunity calculation. Perhaps like cold enough, perhaps not. article say.

I‚Äôm saying VITT quite unique side effect similar regular blood clots. far seems like risk 1 500K seems like extremely small risk. 

At point Denmark consider following: risk greater, side effect vaccine, vs risk covid complications caused waiting extra weeks different vaccine. Bring vaccine passports! guess beggars choosers all. need double mask indoors fully vaccinated? we're letting everyone back in

See Fully vaccinated travellers Sweden hasn‚Äôt stopped. haven‚Äôt recieved deliveries. J&amp;J still recommended aged 65 up, almost shot.

So, yeah, I'd say chances dying COVID damn near 100%. add experience. side sure side effect either shot sore arm even bad enough affect could do. Lasted 2-3 days 1st shot. Barely day 2nd shot. may felt lethargic 1st shot day, could poor night sleep. lack side effects

Yeah, putting scientists quotations, definitely skeptic. paranoid. literally cause everything bad that's happened past 18 months.

If actively going we're suppose to, yes part want people start taking vaccine, stop acting like uptake hesitancy makes stupid bad person.

Nice change words completely change argument. Hesitance means they'll still get vaccinated. talking hesitance, talking anti-science paranoia basis reality. Flu shot found dose 3, full dose everyone else Google tracker shows 7.43M vaccine doses administered NJ 3.29M people fully vaxxed. NJ population 8.882M. letting people get second doses next 3-4 weeks pretty much guarantees herd immunity month end. Especially given 1M people (11.3%) confirmed previously infected. Probably lot higher Texas though! Ha. Idk don‚Äôt live there.... expectations unrealistic. It‚Äôs virus, doesn‚Äôt care human schedules. tenth two per day. chance whatsoever less 5 people going die extra month pandemic. Even lengthening current phase pandemic week results 5 deaths. idea you‚Äôre downvoted. Fuck people would kill others willful ignorance mean vaccines medications? totally different ballgames. 

Pediatric medication dosing complex. Unless it‚Äôs medication prescribe frequently look check every time. medications, see age range followed weight dosing. Cefriaxone good example. Neonates weight dosing 25-100mg/kg/day delineated based day life (post-natal age). Kids 6 weeks end 50-100mg/kg/day. Even reading post this, realized gonorrhea dosing changed 2020. 

 far vaccines go, totally naive children *usually* require vaccine boosters immunity (4 tetanus vaccines 15mo, example, adults get one every 10 years). Yet HPV vaccine, younger are, fewer boosters needed. looking minimum amount needed stimulate good immune response. won‚Äôt get sick opening window. Try put thought loop head. Outdoor transmission rare, exposure time matters.

For outdoor transmission occur, think two singers amphitheater stage sharing microphone sing duet. Something close may result droplet transmission. guy I'm going straight tell one care. going sound like one deniers time last year people going live lives fear vaccinated there's still possibility could get infected. rate infection people vaccinated small, even smaller still amount people get seriously ill. 

There extremely little danger interacting vaccinated people inside. ridiculousness sides virus. act like nothing going act like little helping. logic second part comment actually feeds anti-vaxxer rhetoric. get vaccine can't even go hang friend? truth matter vaccines extremely effective preventing getting virus spreading virus, also massively reduces effectiveness virus body. People might otherwise died getting colds now. going justify shutdowns people vaccine cold?

We need realistic honest people risk levels people make decisions. still get sick vaccines? Yes. still hospitalized? Yes. still spread it? Yes. *likely* it? *How* sick going get? point justify allowing people fully vaccinated ability congregate?

For me, personally, young, healthy, vaccinated person lives home vaccinated people hangs people vaccinated since early March, fear getting spreading virus little. think need realistic say people ""hey, vaccinated, go ahead hang people vaccinated. please stay away aren't."" really idea. guess either try cases high otherwise controversial type study later get exposed virus clearly understand, continue insist I'm advocating restrictions lifted safe so.

If need mask mandates public transportation another four months, it. telling people another four months things changing rapidly *no one actually knows long they'll needed* going help anyone. want people vaccinated? Supporting blanket, long extensions like shooting foot. Unfortunately, never. false equivalence? flu vaccine available kids.

But flu vaccine notoriously *not* effective guess variants floating around year? influenza mutates higher rate? Wtf? Lol. I‚Äôm vaccinated. I‚Äôm saying eventually unvaccinated get covid probably work out. 

I want ppl get vaccinated science science regardless politics. Pour one 12-15 yo anti vax parents. public perception without wearing mask? I'm ny ny people streets masks on, plus everywhere indoors requires one.

Also curious approaching new ppl, mention vaccinated ask them?


I'm getting second Wednesday, excited get back normalcy 25 health conditions job bumps queue yet first shot next week. Everyone wants vaccine get one long September Thank this. know people downvoting original comment, hard mentally ill. hard rationalize thoughts sometimes. think what's important remember even smelled smoke, 10 ft away would travel quite distance get understand (could wrong) amount needed smell smoke small fraction covid transmitted. realistically speaking, also means would put risk time neighbors balcony talking, something oddly enough get paranoid before. mean pandemic isn‚Äôt still uncertainty regarding variants. People write like we‚Äôre post-COVID.  *400lb 12 year olds.* 

It's disgusting parents allow kids get way. Obviously trying demonize parent cause kid got fat. 400lbs inexcusable. I'm Denver strict probably locked NY. aware outdoor mask mandate repealed it. Everything read said outdoor transmission low. one ever said anything whole time notice dirty looks idk. went Florida I'd say 95% people wear masks anywhere. week suddenly feels normal wear them. back try read room. others wearing masks will, see without em put on. I'm asked someone business I'll immediately comply, big deal, they're job. 

As meeting new people vaccinated eventually comes up, like first question one ever seems worried it. Social distancing rules make complicated, right opportunity comes make blessing disguise. invite somebody meet line drink whatever table.

Congrats getting shot! Enjoy getting back normal! first night post-vaccination, feels even surreal see people Twitter say ""I'm fully vaccinated continue wear mask outside newborns get vaccinated"". seems social media gets divorced reality day, since bars went packed, especially past 10 PM. public holiday kind thing. (but all) places work close schools, usually Friday Monday people get longer weekend. 8 UK actually low side European country.  think that‚Äôs misinterpretation. piece spike protein itself. reason vaccines safe quantity location expressions. Would anything India suddenly needing keep vaccines producing? matter are? customers wanted one? Well, without counting exact proportions anything, somehow line well manufacturers delivering average compared prior expectations? least countries reliant AZ la teachers union massively corrupt absolutely horrible organization. Funny, hit 100lbs till 18 I‚Äôve seen. there's remote villages.  Giving ownership IP dangerous setting. enclosed space, masks, people eating talking laughing etc. one anxious going back society, probably first thing getting second dose One biggest civil injustices recent memory people commiting would tell committed social justice. Totally horrible Yeah I‚Äôve never worried transmission way, annoying people area started wearing outside giving death stares / yells didn‚Äôt, addition scurrying away across street even everyone (including you) masked :/  vaccines ageist? cite concrete evidence prove opposite? literally feel anything got pfizer vaccine.  lot young adults getting second vaccine dose throughout May. Stats trends shown people fully vaccinated= cases go down. Gotta admit, I‚Äòm somewhat boat don‚Äôt see issue. Yes, I‚Äòll get covid vaccine take medications doctor prescribes them. simply popping pill every little headache runny nose? don‚Äòt think that‚Äôs particularly healthy. worth usually, maybe use data social media future. title misinformation, even though may intentional. big difference, far FDA concerned, drug AUTHORIZED APPROVED. Businesses fully open people can/should still wear masks gathering large groups. big deal. There's controversy anyone says otherwise deliberately trying stir nothing.

Just CDC guidelines say masks need worn outside, mean people can't wear masks outside choose to. 100% sure honestly. briefing said:

‚ÄúData weekend several pharmacies (Walgreens, Albertsons, CVS) yet available doses administered yesterday likely low. missing doses weekend reflected numbers next couple days.‚Äù

If nationwide, may what‚Äôs causing disparity doses. don‚Äôt see you‚Äôre getting downvoted, I‚Äôd enjoy party far maskless. I‚Äôve wondered thing see news cases China.  Vaccination Demographics update 2021-05-03

Notes:

* raw data downloaded exact totals every age group downloaded [CDC vaccination demographic trends CSV. CDC indicates data ""Date Administered"", actually appears ""Date Reported"".
* Texas (about 9% US population) excluded CDC demographic data, tables match national totals.
* CDC reports vaccinations 0-17 age group. 16-17 age group calculated using 2019 Census estimates 11.4% aged 0 17 ages 16 17, assuming 0-17 age group doses given ages 16 17. Hospitals business uno I‚Äôm vaccinating mine. saw someone‚Äôs 13 year old trial vax gave crippling migraines two weeks, pulled kid trial completely. Also, seems awful lot anecdotes major effects menstruation, last thing 12 16 year old daughters need. 

Every single kid know got Covid either asymptomatic mild cold symptoms day. children zero health issues. Covid would issue them. grandparents fully vaxxed, worries there. 

I weighed risks rewards made decision children don‚Äôt need vax it‚Äôs side effects.  Yet people getting vaccinated young minorities, two groups generally conservative. Interesting That‚Äôs life you‚Äôre immune compromised, death disease always table. Unfortunately there‚Äôs much reasonably society protect  average test 400,000-600,000 people per days, antigen tests included number. Denmark population 5.8 million people. think might ones tests per capita world. Hahaha one thing hangovers definitely part it! 2000 mile road trip national parks last year. hundreds maskless pictures. need pick right type vacation. I‚Äôm 17 got pretty bad reaction shot 2, don‚Äôt think much age. Dosing isn‚Äôt important vaccines, seems like lot people reactions shot two, don‚Äôt think would worse shot given 12-15 year old. wouldn‚Äôt approve unsafe. vaccinated person infected COVID spread virus easily unvaccinated asymptotic.

Can give cite, please? nation wide issue? Yes. that‚Äôs explicitly stated article.  K ""Safety established"" ""shown safe"" thing. could still long term delayed serious side effects. one reasons still monitoring safety. However, understanding likelihood impact much less vaccine available encouraged emergency use. first step everything open. Arizona took like week possible to, ok get 2019 again. I'm also okay people getting vaccines, want mingling regular society. severe vaccine reactions/allergies that's fine. small minority valid excuse. excuse, privileged enough continue spread plague due choice. can't stand people's sense entitlement. likely never fully end community spread. endemic. kills less people flu example (60k year!), everyone wants immune is,, honestly justify travel van? bank holiday? take turns diving giant pits gold coins like Scrooge McDuck?  Tell vaccine exports beside AZ loan swap deal, Pfizer allowed start exporting since last couple weeks? Export allowed certain thresholds reached, ridiculous given demand shortage currently. Moderna able export well.

And yes alternate sources. However, large part production facilities established US, disproportionally affects rest world supply line cut off. kind specialization happens world economies scale. Yep. use extreme case business could ask prove HIV negative served. HIPAA violation. Probably violates law HIPAA.  Janssen suspended though, it‚Äôs use currently due logistical issues.  States supporting push greater vaccination actually setting secure passport systems like NY, engaging meaningless saber rattling makes hard businesses function.

[Vaccine FAQ Part FAQ Part appointment bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Wait really?? Wow wasn‚Äôt expecting summer, really excited get it!  That's great! think means? That‚Äôs reassuring it‚Äôs vigorous. vaccines side effects showed months shot. now, it‚Äôs way longer two months trial participants. ‚Äúnot opening IP‚Äù ‚Äúdisaster‚Äù, factories capable producing vaccines IP already? see \[1\] CDC says 8 per 100K hospitalized Covid-19. suspect low number published August newer strains, we'll run it.

We see \[2\] flu vaccine reduces hospitalizations kids 40%-60%. point, explicitly mentions spite vaccine matching well mutated variants.

Here \[3\] see pediatric flu vaccination rates \~60%

Here \[4\] see flu hospitalization rates 17.3 per 100K kids 5-17

So assume 17.3 per 100K non-vaccinated, BEST 60% flu vaccine reduction gets us like, 7 100K flu hospitalization rate, line 8 per 100K (obviously non-vaccinated) kids above

So point would willing concede argument above, except analysis far assumes every kid's infection risk equal Covid Flu. \[5\] CDC estimates let's call 56 million flu cases 2019-2020 season, pretty bad. roughly 1-year period, CDC estimates \[6\] 114M cases Covid. factoring increased transmission, kid roughly twice hospitalization risk Covid flu?

But many vaccinated Americans many people already Covid, we're going see many cases next year. **I left conclude probably can't justify covid flu kids available science.**

I would rephrase /u/lebron_garcia's question, though. No, keep kid home *entire* 2019-2020 flu season. would silly. **Risk spectrum, boolean.** yes, keep eye county's flu rates season, weeks went shopping left kid partner numbers bad. weeks recommended skip trip bowling alley. couple weeks trip Disney World, kinda cut back fun outings stuff want get sick $10K vacation. still lots fun things, whatever wanted willy-nilly without analyzing risks.

I'm tired false dichotomy bullshit. Analyze data, see tradeoffs are, try make best decisions can. There's pretty comfortable life ""live nuclear bunker"" ""the pandemic's over! EVERYONE GO CHUCK-E-CHEESE""

\[1\] know it‚Äôs much go around huge country hope US ship whatever spare AZ help out, since seems little need it. Unfair speak Mexico central/South America, know, least Canada likely manage current supplies have/expect, even India keeps vaccine production (as should, given dire situation). 1) apply since medical provider. 

2) would voluntarily giving medical info. consent yuo show proof vaccination. 

It's HIPAA violation. guess also take account 'risk period' one month, people (who would got J &amp; J vaccine) get Pfizer / Moderna vaccine. So, work whether chances catching significant case COVID 1 month period age group, compare risk blood clots vaccine. Especially cases dropping places. 

 see governments making decisions shift focus other, nominally safer, vaccines. vaccines exported? Apart ones loaned Canada Mexico (AZ) obviously can't get raw materials elsewhere least amount needed.  say history guide, I'm guessing six months likely they'll enough firm data make recommendation. figure around Christmas. financial considerations fund State government programs provide housing, food, education, medical care need it. right consider full spectrum needs residents, put aside. might affect definitely affects me, child developed dermatitis around mouth thanks them. flu side effects nausea, headaches, hangover symptoms? question variants:

So far, seems like vaccines still provide pretty meaningful protection variants emerged, great news. imply vaccine likely provide protection new variants emerge future, still pretty unknown? Probably Disney land Disney world. much subject Florida's anti-vaccine passport law.  Father going thing, got cancer correlates high mortality rate covid, despite getting shots still needs double mask avoid public/quarantine covid big deal. like people forgot vaccinate protect immunocompromised fucking frustrating. Disney mainly outdoors I'm convinced risk big long limit crowd sizes. I've heard number people thrilled limits say much better experience pack park people obviously $$$$. Yes use article title following week cases trended hard fact lowest week infections since early March trending down. God hate media one favors  Article worth opening. interactive graph ages admitted hospital state. everyone vaccinated, ergo everyone comping establishment vaccinated. Quite contrary.

That's exactly is.

This year made absolutely despise media. haven‚Äôt seen directly addressed anything I‚Äôve read: younger patients admitted getting severe form disease room resources hospitals seniors largely vaccinated? wonder many younger patients would‚Äôve sent home last spring past winter. vaccines protect 1 20 people (95% efficiency).

It's easy talk big game house wallet going effected, employers/colleges/schools start requiring (some hospitals already have) hardened anti-vaxxers refuse small percentage opinion.  Nepal probably incapable dealing COVID.

This half true. Nepali people used country wide strikes. Lockdown adherence DNA. So, shutdown country completely (we're already headed path).

That said, comment true spirit. healthcare system shit. poor fuck. unlike India, probably going get much attention international community large. I‚Äôm white traveled 20 miles Detroit shots that‚Äôs available slots were. got inside almost nurses empty stations.

Source: thus far, less likely getting struck lightning given year. Let's see, rather cautious think September likely 18-30 crowd vaccinated It‚Äôs distressing surprising learn much situation could alleviated US actually partnered countries make vaccines since fall, hell, even didn‚Äôt block raw supplies. things essentially reported sub mainstream media outlets. YES! THANK YOU! think new strategy large indoor anti-vaxxer parties poorly ventilated buildings. vaccine passports lot eager vaccines. vaccine passports also cover tests, previous infection. Many people schedules get tested week, it‚Äôs biggest hassle anymore. I‚Äôm personally okay decision, really bad health anxiety get headaches often enough headache I‚Äôd get AZ J&amp;J would send incredible panic attack. I‚Äôm happy fear mine mitigated.

I‚Äôm also happy dropped vaccines taken voluntarily. Hey, enough people take them, maybe offered mRNA vaccine little bit sooner.

I'm 17 yet I'm still allowed take ;-; Good know. situation currently India felt like warned / worried March April last year. believe Alberta approved 12-15 year olds existing conditions. 11.5 year old. quite anxiously waiting chance get vaccine. Actually, always running out, even multiple companies producing vaccines. Everytime local health centre gets more, usually gone hours, unless massive shipment mass inoculation (which finally managed get first dose, even gone day). Might also see uptick late summer college bound students find universities require anyone staying campus. media site always representing Texas data. sure why...but do.

There way would invest logistics, money, time kind uncertainty. global standpoint still ton it. Better push next year save investment bigger event then. 

This nothing like cancelling concert US. Yes it‚Äôs part reason people India haven‚Äôt able get home sooner. people seem want blame leaving earlier, wasn‚Äôt necessarily possible.

Hopefully order turned booster shots.  get assistance China countries. relatively small country easy assist.  Ozapft :( people want get vaccinated aren‚Äôt able health reasons/allergies/etc? plan approaching life vaccination rates peak COVID guidelines removed? Im happy people highly vaccinated countries might soon return ‚Äúnormal‚Äù, I‚Äôm looking forward well feel bit bad people want vaccine can‚Äôt ever get :/ absolutely correct - checked clinical trial data missed pored data getting Pfizer doses.

Thanks! I‚Äôve read, closer articles current date less sure magnitude reinfection severity cases. say hope right tho thanks :) said isolated? live heavy anti-mask area sorry taking precautions family members vulnerable others.

Just said didn‚Äôt see friends person doesn‚Äôt mean didn‚Äôt interact way. people become ""un-vaccinated""? go up? Grad schemes generally care far grade subject. Far better carry first transport management 2.1 engineering.

Degree gets foot door, ability performance testing gets job. They‚Äôre probably still reasonably protected. Minimally drastically cut serious complications/deaths quarantine system definitely problematic perspective, it‚Äôs true. seems like issue larger longer-standing current ban? Great news! 7-year-old 9-year-old. anyone estimate vaccine approved them? approval would dosage. Unsure trials younger kids. Remember though, reason younger people tend side effects immune systems stronger. side effects (while brutal - got I‚Äôm 22) sign bodies hard work producing antibodies. Also, Pfizer vaccine already significantly lower dose Moderna (so already know ‚Äútoo much‚Äù isn‚Äôt going cause significantly higher side effects, since Moderna side effects somewhat hugely common Pfizers) lot factors different US aside climate though. Population density huge one: cities especially areas population density 10x large cities US. That‚Äôs compared US time last year vs year. No. need residence here. Again, I'm addressing comment saying someone ""Mickey Mouse"" degree join large company grad scheme get 6 figures time they're 30.

Doesn't sound like kind degrees referring Mickey Mouse degrees. Probably will, unless government overrules FHI. 

I think take social economic gains account I‚Äôd say benefit J&amp;J vaccine much higher downsides Norway, mean reopening Norway month earlier. FHI bases calculation purely health risk/benefit calculation, though. Makes sense people would protest let feelings known unlocking country. Particularly Ireland worlds longest lockdown. appeal authority way line light past 15 months. Great. American kids get vaccines don‚Äôt need leaving disadvantaged people around world die.

Well not. protected spread virus lower. reality doctors replaced cheaper lower educated providers. However, costs patients decreasing corporations businesses run hospitals healthcare groups simply increase profits. travelers use vaccines, vaccines bad. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Covid burn level flu infections vulnerable deal always have.
Much learned treat too. let people live always have. that's ok, cheers! responses, seems like sub increasingly populated people covid anxiety

It's funny, actually opposite feeling. Relative Twitter place like NYT comment section, sub feels like breath fresh air people feel we'll able return sense normalcy soon enough.

And Twitter real life, even amongst friends, there's sense get back ""normal"" soon. live college campus, basically everyone believes we'll wear masks indoors classes next year (despite fact school mandated vaccines, community risk COVID going astronomically small).

Personally, feel like I've done part past year half. I'm vaccinated, thank goodness. I'm ready reclaim sense normal Well done! Love see neighbours getting thing. That's fair! wanted understand better. Thanks reply. evidence accumulating shows vaccinated people meaningful public health threat, especially received mRNA vaccines. yes, power somewhat reduced vaccines still hold remarkably well *known* variants.

People neither vulnerable represent public health threat treated are. fact vaccines drastically reduce vulnerability *and* level threat pose others.

I‚Äôll never change mind, think dispute continue believe never get better fantasy world almost far gone one claiming COVID real. longer people stayed inside, longer conditioned think right longer going take come shell. spent every day internet sad happens. even got nervous seeing texas rangers game month ago. annoyed AZ drop, big effect me. gotten vaccine yet, I'm still track get first shot summer officially. pushed anybody longer 4 weeks.

That said - heavily speculated dropped vaccines able taken voluntarily soon privately &amp; J&amp;J option I'm taking it. I'm risk group vaccine, get with? know great news personally many American families see bad news rest world. We're going start vaccinating teenagers countries barely started vaccinating elderly due lack supply, eligible Americans means stockpiling vaccines instead sending they're desperately needed. partitions anything. science? last week May, BioNTech increases delivery 40% Moderna J&amp;J increase too, still decent number 1st doses given. can't challenge it. Legislation passed Parliament subject judicial review. Okay you‚Äôre right FDA‚Äôs vaccine scientist four decades wrong. said doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre less safe meant mean they‚Äôre less safe.

You‚Äôre assuming know exactly criteria determine safety better do. think quite people felt forced lot social activities precovid relieved from.  Beers manager coworkers Thursdays? annoying distant family members got guilted visiting drink Christmas new years? course could always say before, always getting guilted it..... Using J&amp;J next week gonna prevent death today, it? People dying infected 3-4 weeks ago. might ever happen America. Ohio, already seeing huge drops vaccine uptake even half population fully vaccinated. UK currently suffering due low supply (very low number first doses). extra doses provided go 600-700k easily. 3 months later. looks like weve done ü§ôüèΩ Good. GREAT news! Anti vax apply everyone want covid vaccine. disingenuous take. happen know Moderna decided go 100ug? week away fully vaccinated, plan returning normal yet. follow CDC says safe, think even go eat outdoor restraunt. 

I'm afraid covid. afraid spreading it, causing anxiety. Covid made realize incredibly selfish vast majority people are. Almost every one know change lived life pandemic. continued going restraunts, traveling, going bars. Seeing many people werent willing make sacrifices lives good everyone else ruined perception people. want around people. infuriating see live care free many died. Thats what's keeping returning normal.  Mostly fever think.  issue Biden signed executive order saying wear masks federal buildings. agree look bit dumb, can't say ""well, me..."" Sounds like messed brain. terrorists? I've back 3 weeks sending insane. sure much longer last. That‚Äôs sad, it‚Äôs really thing Canadians look forward   Masks restrictions gradually fade time. There‚Äôs never going come moment say ‚Äúand... go!‚Äù everyone takes off. People stop time feel safe so. Low case counts low hospitalization rates virtually deaths make people feel safety. got stabbed Windows 10 morning graduation ceremony 15 days! Got summer plans move country lmao sort goes entire purpose vaccines, no? 60% adults vaccinated, spike simply isn‚Äôt possible. act like claiming COVID-19 leading cause death among children. not. 

I acknowledge rarity cause death. 

But within order magnitude terms risk see need argue that. 

However, keep downplaying virus continuing state kill kids. 

That simply true. 

Oddly also keep acknowledging kills kids replies bringing number kids killed swimming pools moose. 

Maybe threshold children's deaths start significance you. 

But assure COVID-19 deaths significance people bury children. 

You entitled opinions. facts. 

The fact children died COVID-19. 

In US killed enough kids empty classrooms. 

In Brazil killed enough kids empty schools. 

And countries keeping kids alive irrelevant anyone actually cares kids?

This virus endemic lives animals people. 

Viruses endemic live people controlled case smallpox eradicated. 

This virus lives animals cannot eradicate it. 

But like helpless. never got work home. exposed virus. 

But also spent much time looking raw data countries Covid-19 clinical trials. 

That spent year masked eating car got vaccinated soon became available. 

I hundreds temperature checks fever got year sign vaccine worked. 

Science kept safe. Science kept family safe. 

Science could keeping many families safe. 

And brought polio would already rid endemic people virus people politicized getting vaccinated too. 

Saying virus kill kids make true. 

But could make less likely people make virus less deadly. 

And know get talking endemic diseases become less lethal time still talking ebola, smallpox, measles malaria. stayed pretty lethal around generations. 

And finally even kill children, cause major injury, kids getting COVID-19 puts adults risk.

And kid wants grow knowing might unintentionally killed teacher grandparent. 

And know probably want call names. 

But end day really want someone make ""To investigate, record make public causes fatal treatment resistance clinical trials Canada"" line law. 

That's rational way save whole lot lives Ontario. 


















 


. Pretty much anti-mask/anti-lockdown/anti-vaccination arguments depend acting like pandemics completely new phenomenon governments dealing long thier governments. disagree specifics deal COVID, want pretend public health even function government. could get hit car tomorrow way work god willing...

Never thought would possible months ago! There's light end tunnel! I'm kids. got first shots 2 weeks ago, time find appointments nearby get school day across town. Now, shots available like everywhere I'm going cancel 2nd appointments place get somewhere local convenient. pharmacies ask shot looking two shots type identical easy switch. excessive all. rate growth situational. What‚Äôs true restrictions still place, warm weather, necessarily true it‚Äôs free weather turns cold. 

We don‚Äôt know percentage population vaccinated keep covid bay US restrictions Winter months. would quite surprised achieve herd immunity situation get less half population vaccinated (60% 16+ pop less half total pop). would mind adopted mindset Asian countries like Japan wear mask cold spreading germs work school. 

But wearing mask prophylactic pandemic over? Well, personally think would necessary. that's me. Brescia places too. city that, together neighboring Bergamo, impacted Italy.  used get sick easily (like really sick 2 weeks time) 3-4 times year far remembered since middle school. Since 2020, gotten even cold. think public, I'll continue wear mask. sure exactly calculated. use website see thought different places different numbers. ones available US offer virtually complete protection serious complications death. terms whether you‚Äôre protected getting all, Pfizer Moderna 90% two shots one-shot J&amp;J bit lower around 70%. chose Pfizer, would taken heartbeat.  Sure, good actually offering kind job, think looking side employer seeing probably minority.

Most places hiring hiring minimum wage jobs, even pay lower pre covid lot corporate entities think get away it.

And certain point, yes are. mean vaccination started everyone access, rest us?

And get it, I'm speaking place privilege well. employer able bring us back forth even though brief second shut still willing pay salary, someone works closely service industry, employers fall 2 camps.

The small business can't afford bring people back pay full wages another shutdown ruins them, larger corporate businesses parent company used covid excuse pay new hires full 2-3 dollars hour less usually part time work.

The worst I've seen regional chain restaurant paying new employees less part time, forces ""be call"" (as job) case someone scheduled goes covid. think whether they're symptomatic applied yet, since gotten second shot. Lived year multiple times Honestly unless member extremely vulnerable population matter all. vulnerable ask doctor calculate R0 exactly? curious wanna find R0 NY No. Get first vaccine available you. end situation get without waiting get whichever, failing J&amp;J vaccine still incredible. Spain digital certificate DNI(that supposed always carry anf clubs must check see 18). store public key numbers verify tapping encrypting random number private key inside DNI. 

They technology using government websites years continue wearing one mean though. doubt wearing 24/7 question. I'd certainly consider public transport winter I'm sick myself. Oh. There's plenty working healthcare right now. vaccine passports allowed essential services. can‚Äôt demand grocery stores example. People mask places. non essential services fair game. smartphone ID cross reference perfectly reasonable prerequisite, given vast majority people able comply. 

You don‚Äôt want disproportionately affect poor people negatively concerns lead vaccine passports hurt demographics, including poor people, smartphones IDs. 

Do want uneven sharing blessings equal sharing misery? focus insulin resistance rather obesity. worst ""I'll keep wearing mask people think I'm conservative"" like A) B) absolute child. Put shots arm zero COVID arrives. It‚Äôs simple. People avoid shot? Non-pharmaceutical interventions (masks, full bars, social distancing) continue. don‚Äôt need everyone get vaccinated. yes, don‚Äôt reach herd immunity vaccination it‚Äôs everyone‚Äôs problem. Deal it.  You‚Äôre probably one mindless selfish goons prolonged pandemic acting like toddler didn‚Äôt get way since March 2020 yelled screamed ‚Äúfreedoms‚Äù, one actually took away. true!!! Yeah think lot big talk good portion people. 

Personally I'll take risk catching couple colds every year exchange wear mask every go anymore.   risk exactly there? 60%+ adults vaccinated, case growth falls apart. word ""terrorist"" lost meaning Turkey. Interesting know measles still around know heard immunity... stop sky let's open anything zero covid  Okay people refuse get vaccinated? That‚Äôs problem think people go bars? Haha going police enforce it? Y'all lost minds scary. probably one hermits never left home wiped everything arent you? Nothing life guarantee except death. get 60% range fine.  Yeah no, I‚Äôm Italian don‚Äôt know anybody that‚Äôs around 40 lives parents‚Ä¶don‚Äôt get wrong, somebody that‚Ä¶but uncommon‚Ä¶ Well done. Hope US let countries get vaccine pfizer. ü§û basically can't work home, means everyone well? like everyone pro-restrictions works home vice versa. There's plenty opposite. Yeah sure, but, derogatory term. entirely intended put people down. allowed mean words anymore? grow trailer park, played time best friend lived one. still opinion ""trailer trash"". Yeah governments want staying home spend monopoly money businesses cause civil unrest. Good one guys!

They want us homes _reasons_.
Has nothing surplus medical equipment anything. Would one infected transmit? Come Looking UK, NY, California, Israel seems leveling 40% things start dip 50%. Arizona another one I'm watching vaccinations slowed around 40% cases seem relatively flat. main source here, one cited made question whether powered without taking anything given really need take them.

All sources say safe take after, nothing conclusive (or really anything) impact efficacy based potentially dampened response.

It's likely conclusively known.

I fail see claiming misinformation reasoning probably better take NSAIDs Ibuprofen really need them.

Do disagree that? India presumably mostly B.1.617 now. Bangladesh still almost B.1.351. know relative contagiousness 617, 351 lower reproductive rates B.1.1.7 P.1 competed head head. difference alone easily explain different outcomes countries. vaccines approved emergency use... y'all keep forgetting emergency status forget send food. 12,000 per day dying starvation directly related lockdown measures. anybody cares, since UN begging support December, Oxfam Unicef since last April, media ignored entirely since would cast lockdowns bad light.  worldwide 7 day average appears plateaued.  Also prison guards, IIRC.

Oh, fuckton healthcare workers. sad vast majority people still hospital covid ones voluntarily turned vaccine.

No, be. sad NOW, people hospital choice it. 

If bunch anti-vaxxers get hospitalized COVID, hope get better, sure hell going shed tear don't.  entirely true... states rolled vaccines differently. 

For example, available everyone North Carolina april 7th, scheduled appointment. 

So, lot people NC gotten first second shots yet - available groups full month yet. 

I bet states also slow release schedule. rollout done yet. 2 months, different story. It‚Äôs risk now. problem everyone else vaccine widely available direct impact us.

Some us kids 16 can't get vaccinated yet. get vaccinated, way hell sending back school, going continue social distancing sake. Indians get visa visit China, arrive china serve 14 day possibly compulsory quarantine  Whenever anti-vaxxer argues always point remarkable vaccination effort Israel caseload numbers. anyone could think coincidence beyond me. denying vaccines work effective. Yay! Thank real, walk door without mask (which okay outdoors away crowds according CDC) literally one best memories past 15 months. It‚Äôs amazing.    nitpicking, Israel higher proportion underage populations several points comparison 100% precise. compared vaccine eligible populations gap would slightly larger 62% 44% total population comparison. Sometimes discrimination ok. believe it. I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre better place earlier year. It‚Äôs amazing state best people I‚Äôve ever met.  lot stay even marriage. Underrated comment here. news article company thinks people need product soon. science. Yeah, bummer can't get vaccine valid medical reasons, though. shoot messenger please.  mean like raw materials [we're giving 4 million doses [AZ vaccine we're giving anything anti-vaxxers. Like maybe fans specific soccer team? $2 billion? That's embarrassing. $50 billion. probably agency makes sense international agency (diseases give shit borders). 

I suspect, though, COVID dealt with, learned lesson significantly increase budget. misinformation spreading? I‚Äôve going city state‚Äôs stats near-daily basis. We‚Äôve hit 55% adults least one shot rate case growth fallen 70% restrictions routinely getting lifted. least short term, it‚Äôs hard see we‚Äôd start spiking and, broadly, it‚Äôs even remotely tenable go back shutting things down. 

Again, question comes following: mass vaccination can‚Äôt allow people meaningfully return lives, what‚Äôs even point? supposed get people board ‚Äúexit strategy‚Äù doesn‚Äôt lead exit all? life career basically fell apart I‚Äôm sure could go again. 44 year old American 15 year old son. Due financial hit taken COVID-19, recently (March 9th), moved 78 year old Mother. son actually enjoyed much has. finally able help things around house yard work (she EXTREMELY ACTIVE almost 80 year old!) spend quality time together, 3 generations spend time night playing game shows watching programs together. cook eat together happy memories son well. Plus learn help need can. Well, everybody community getting covid one way get herd immunity! But... why?  would think would first? Yeah either Connecticut. flashy, bet gets lot clicks. Well federal mandate federal land. that's could do. got first jab Friday mass vaccination site city, go metal detector get in. Thanks anti-vaxxers! Exactly. vaccines arrived super concerned (and angry) going lives covid real big deal. vaccines I'm getting 2nd shot Saturday I'm longer concerned others treat pandemic. Add family friends fully vaccinated community well way people's recklessness longer public concern life. areas really bad people refusing get vaccinated understand still upset people. Overall California right middle pack (slightly better average) terms overall cases per capita since start pandemic.

So definitely hit particularly hard comparatively, though rough stretch winter.  worth, Mississippi's reporting inconsistent. often go 2+ days without reporting meaningful administration - including past 2 days. seem strongly correlate weekends I'm sure deal is. 

Regardless, Mississippi languishing since early campaign. reason first state Continental US open 16+ - demand strong rural Republican population Black population. groups highly vaccine hesitant reflected state's demand (as well demand rest Deep South).

I've long modeled Mississippi winner ""lowest end vaccination rate"" despite relatively decent job early days campaign terms getting shots arms. logistics (kudos state), arms stopped showing up. spread it? That‚Äôs bullshit mate  goal reduce # cases. Jan 20 - averaged 195k cases, we're 50k cases. point. show clear shift previous white house admin masks work people wear them. issue states communities, definitely isnt case, everyone expected, thats future clusters end Hopefully manage handle outbreaks further. They've done before, I'm sure manage again. definitely easier there's adult surge testing pretty easy get. case last year though, still nowhere test 2 year old except bringing urgent care associated pediatrician's office. still antigen tests reason told us wanted PCR we'd shipped kit. last cold - 2 times, even realize daughter sick first one got sick (we notified another kid daycare cold symptoms), second one came quick succession know new illness got second cold (I tested negative times PCR...I keep damn spare Pixel kit around times wait ship here). infer level grumpiness maybe hear unclear post nasal drip night. yeah every cold major ""is COVID?"" freakout mind f*** days work even get 2 week quarantine negative test. feel like employers lost sympathy point good us literally childcare 2 months last year.  Bay Area one metro areas never major surge, never hospitals filled capacity. one biggest Covid-19 success stories United States. Hm sure? thought considering 100 day federal mandate decided it.

If asked everyone wear 100 days 101 days ago I'd consider obligation listen request now. realized flattening curve bad idea? would quick cast moniker everyone. available doesnt mean everyone fully vaccinated since is, minimum, 2 week post-1st dose period dont full protection vaccine, people, period closer 5 6 weeks depending one got. obviously, 1st dose offer protection, doesnt mean people cant get infected interim 1st 2nd doses

oh dont forget, quarter population cant get vaccinated children, quite outbreaks schools right Jesus. IHME leaving much room error. happy part group. :D There's also articles time immunity likely lasts years. I've seen, settled. Cool. Well, I'm gonna go back trying add body human knowledge keep doing... whatever is. Trolling? jerk? 

I hope find fulfilling :) imagine getting butthurt internet points lmfao

Guess developed manufactured two effective vaccines world. Oh yeah. Lol y'all fighting fucking AstraZeneca blood clots got enough vaccines every adult country. Who's idiot country now.  Love know number blood clot incidents billion doses. Feels like it‚Äôs lot less 1 200k-250k. indications point Massachusetts. could one New England states, likely MA. New Hampshire highest first doses today (ahead MA), candidly data little odd I'm sure trust (they either under-reporting second doses over-reporting first doses). Massachusetts ""velocity"" shown resiliency first dose administration remaining eligible population shrinks.

This come surprise almost universally tops charts public health measures well education strongly correlated willingness vaccinate.   extremely low natural immunity compared states, little 4th wave surge hit Oregon states enough immunity increase. Several Oregon health experts analysis say decrease near May 4th. showed math comparing natural immunities vaccines states achieved started see decreases. might already there, checked positivity rates tests weekend. 

Brown already said want open fully June, mostly based vaccine %. Portland, still high demand percentages keep increasing least short term. indoor dining restriction seems like much, also imagine another week two hospitalizations get back March numbers. also increased outdoor capacity probably due CDC guidelines. 

Overall, Oregon extremely conservative virus. top 3 lowest cases per capita 5th lowest deaths per capita. lot people like shit Oregon strict rules, least can't argue results. I'm glad I'm one concerned lies verifiably false... fact topic become politicized longer honest talk subject without coming quack   There's numerous articles posted Reddit weeks now.  Tuskegee experiment nothing vaccinations. also long time ago. think acceptable believe there's conspiracy widespread every doctor, nurse, hospital, pharmacy, FDA worker vaccination distribution process it?

They performed exact experiment Tuskegee whites hear us using much pea brained morons want believe Covid19 like flu big deal. destroyed flu. vent little still many idiots either equate getting Covid19 vaccine political belief, won‚Äôt get it, don‚Äôt trust vaccine don‚Äôt really know why...and won‚Äôt get it, reaching level vaccination necessary herd immunity may reached. incredible stupidity there. helped identify deem stupid deal voluntarily. Arrogance damned.  Thank much!  Yeah, still 50% higher peak first wave deaths still around much time 3rd wave. Definitely lot work done. 15% US population 16 can't get vaccine moment. means need 85% adults get full vaccination unlikely happen. Shots 12 coming, even herd immunity. Also 70% estimate, course, would differ infectiousness dominant strain. expect herd immunity US 2021 hope I'm wrong. wonder state end highest percentage vaccinated. bets? Good riddance.  one calling game now. Obviously 50K stable number move forward with, considering we're number restrictions sparse they've year really great sign. pog probably sad anything tell, mississippi stagnated 40% people 18 least 1 dose last 3 days, thats ideal Yes, agree! think obesity factor. think put focus insulin resistance general health, though. really huge fear mine. fight type anti science? Straight dumb? Yeah educate people. people willingly want know truth. refuse it. see facts dismiss them. Scary stuff. That‚Äôs true, know per capita we‚Äôve lowest number cases country, definitely feeds it. 

Unfortunately also quite anti-vaxxers here, esp rural areas. suppose it, also note Pfizer well established. modernas first product market since inception N95 good enough probably bit cheaper. recommend 3M. I‚Äôve also heard good things KF94 mask cannot vouch quality filtration. 10 states higher rate cases per capita last two weeks. Oregon still less half cases per capita Michigan. Hardly ‚Äúleading‚Äù country.  current daily death rate would see 250,000 deaths covid year. really need number drop substantially calling game. UK similar vaccination natural infection rates compared US equivalent deaths per capita 75 day. Literally 1 tenth much. unlike India, every adult opportunity get vaccinated. point call responsibility say duty protect them? Facebook people running trial would probably want test change behavior therefore results trial. really want know understand completely. whining me. respect choice, respect mine. I‚Äôll wear required law/crowded places, otherwise it‚Äôs judgment call give general reason they‚Äôre young aren‚Äôt worried catching it.

I really understand that. I'm early 30's, personally getting sick never biggest concern, possibility passing vulnerable friends/family. luck, people see everyone know getting shot fine get well.

I've also seen articles talking young folks lower rate vaccination [see know much trend hold. many flat earthers met? meet them? Pace slowing. We'll see bumps approved 12-15 year olds (probably July) school starts fall since required lot places (so August September).

My guess hit 200 million around end year though, unless drastic action taken like financial incentives get vaccinated. maybe major outbreak places low rates. Cumulative distribution curve here: protection symptom onset starts around day 11 (so protection infection would within one week first dose). Interesting way phrase things  probable hesitancy police force, also possible they're reporting received vaccine. instance, company fine print relinquishing HIPPA rights company, reported I've taken vaccine company.  including numbers West Bank Gaza? Israel responsible areas well.  Mass represent recycling whole ""it's bad flu"" nonsense got us mess? Terrorism belief system yeah, thinking otherwise super naive. us exist bubble small portion global population. 71% let‚Äôs get 80% Firebombing... vaccination hub? There's always crazies there... ones can't keep antivax sentiments themselves. problem don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs coincidence, believe numbers lie. It‚Äôs easy dismiss anything doesn‚Äôt fit world view calling lie. issue states need incentives also tend states dont give enough shit things. businesses thing course theres lot variability there, big mountain climb regardless - Tests: 1,114,963 - Cases: 26,945 - Deaths: 368 - Currently Hospitalized: 35,598 - Currently ICU: 7,429 (+/- compared day last week Tests/Cases/Deaths &amp; yesterday Hosp/ICU)

Source: higher death totals past days. Could older deaths recorded/reported. less dangerous flu children?  younger age groups flooding intensive care units everywhere variances. 

This real thing actually happening US. Bummer good news

Which vaccines look like added emergency use list soon? mean...you could entire time. Masks never necessary outside close people. (Before someone accuses anti-masker, absolutely pro-mask always been.) Mental health real, sucks way treat it. Wow Well course! weird time discover Target sells L/XL sized masks cover giant face. bought 4 especially foresee indoor masks sticking around lot longer especially even events ‚Äúreturn office masks‚Äù kinda thing. I‚Äôll take point. 

And honestly totally see wearing public transit cold/flu season. came $2 it‚Äôs like spent much money them. 

Just put one went ‚Äúholy shit masks fitting pst year?‚Äù seems like general affluence determines vaccine rates political affiliation, though already ton overlap two variables already. yet Facebook still making money. well actually, florida still average. ""southern"" state national average virginia

the cdc says 56.1% americans 18 least 1 dose, south 50%, florida kentucky 52% range. virginia, exception, 60%

for comparison, new england dominates 70% depending state look think they're already back normal. Like everywhere open really masks used public transport shops. first many. Facebook Excellent. Keep going

This nightmare finally end would matter? vaccine essentially training immune system immune system eliminates it.

A year now, (and if) booster required, immune system doesn‚Äôt remember previous vaccine.

If go gym trainer works month, need use trainer rest life? [That's absolute Going first shot soon, hoping borders open HK surprised learn high rent, low salaries delayed independence due people pursuing university degrees also reason lot people home 35. social framework allow it, lack opportunity plays role too. True, opinion snowball's chance happening reconciliation (and even then, complete knobs Kyrsten Sinema Joe Manchin whose number one priority seems get everyone think government completely useless), think 2022. then, states get creative. Even then, I'm skeptical we're going see 7-day average increase one day next ever again. think best hope long right tail declines glacial pace.

In meantime, there's nothing stopping us proactive. Going businesses workers can't take time off, getting doses community health centers minority low-income people trust almost exclusively health, etc. know right? still 50% higher peak first wave

I'm kind amazed actual epidemiologist realize testing capacity multiple magnitudes larger april. maybe vaccinate Palestinians.  course, 1 country hosting Olympics year also worse vaccination-wise Togo, 14th poorest country entire world. Random question: situation like Gaza Cisjordan?  person schools safe. There's extensive data support this. think WA pretty low covid rates, probably less natural immunity places. coverage variants monumentally overblown. Total population reality US anything - COVID remain endemic. ability end virus minimal cost (via vaccines), choose to. 

That said, find ironic still put people jail smoking marijuana many states shoplifting $20 worth goods people refusing go get shot help contributing killing people considered copacetic. realize difference negative positive act, problem contagious diseases break model. city changed mass vax sites walk ups available. It‚Äôs beginning May. difference year makes. I‚Äôm assuming reference something, I‚Äôm reading rejected lyrics Rock Lobster Shit, safety measures quickly disappearing already. they're deliberately testing large person gatherings. Everyone tested going, everyone closely monitored after. need bit research. percentage vaccinated numbers based total population total eligible population? example, somewhere like Maine (with oldest population median age state) going ratio total eligible total population that‚Äôs much higher place like Utah, youngest population state median age three full years.  wish media would interview 1000 people got diagnosed AZ. better testimony anti-vaxxer wishing gotten free, readily available vaccine? We're gonna build wall make Pfizer pay it! get that

But method? pill/spray, something noooo, it‚Äôs always dang needle 

I really bad around tend multiple panic attacks near (almost heart attack, yes tried Xanax) 

Kinda gotta wait go get mine called ""a science experiment "" vaccinated last week. person argued ""they show us numbers colds flus past year"", implying covid those...still. Also person customer mine industry filled idiots like this. incredible. Neat, asking last year feel like worker shortages construction field couldn‚Äôt find stuff. (Or looking incorrectly.)

Real estate US metro going insane reasons. 

Still, nice 2024 backup options. make 2024.

Thanks.  mutant way vaccinations original covid variant. parents vaccinated got virus, although serious people died due complications healthcare infrastructure due utter mismanagement central state govts. India. Central leadership local leadership failed miserably. Elections priority, people foolish. Protest, religious ceremonies, election rallies screwed bad, catasprohically bad. blame central govt. also majority ‚Äúbufoonish‚Äù public country spread. Yes, choice. grins per CDC.

""The risk complications healthy children higher flu compared COVID-19 ""

Did keep kids home flu season prior COVID? Unless kids immuocomprimised risks COVID low. kids went back full time person school one brought covid home. far enough vaccination process get wife did. 17 year old seems gotten around time first shot. ended mild case kids like bad cold wife. first shot couple weeks earlier probably gave protection. Sucks get near end though avoiding year. read 60M doses simply made complete lie. respectable sources saying otherwise? notice put top comment, none articles linked mentions number 4M gave away. **May. 3, 00:00 (UTC+9)**

Thank goodness places pretty rural warm weather, pretty much saving them. think hard vaccine smackdown hesitant adults would backfire. employers mandate I'm sure, hope get point show papers grocery shopping. I'm sure slide kids' vaccines schedules approved children. importantly, even claim facts back up. preparing possibility. they.  annoying reduction vaccines do. hate one ""yes technically right"" situations, vaccines *vastly* reduce infection rates transmission rates still technically infect others. would fine government stopped importing hundreds thousands people world, many arriving testing positive, many even required quarantine.

Canadians punished corporations import people, pay minimum wage shut whole country spread infections continuing import people repeating cycle over. Lockdowns, masks social isolation done nothing even did, pointless going bring thousands infected people.

It's sociopathic behaviour government, farmers corporations. 

Canadians done nothing spread SARS-Cov-2 respiratory viruses Canada. reason think would want protect themselves. numbers often 2-3 days prior, yesterday. see CDC 64k first doses logged Saturday   Deep South faces vaccine hesitancy two largest demographics: white mostly rural Republicans Blacks. dramatic oversimplification generalization, state like Alabama, either white Republican Black Democratic. groups normal hesitancy, there's many left. 

Florida comparatively white (albeit high proportion Hispanics) helps. true. know jumped vaccinations. Covid-19 number one killer police officers last year, believe. takes 2 tango,. case one got mine today! Went drive mass vaccination cite 5 mins actually saw release thought ridiculous, ten years ago. Experts using bullhorns warn us pandemic decade ago. Soderbergh thought interesting subject film. Crazy times living think talking case #'s Saturday numbers driven mass-vax weekend sites.  correctly transition walk-in pharmacy injections, expect specifically drop. country hoarding vaccines isn‚Äôt something I‚Äôm proud want really engage first lol.

That nothing whether take vaccine freely available genuinely don‚Äôt know long term effects given political economic climate vaccines made honestly don‚Äôt think costs outweigh benefits.

Then properly weighing costs benefits. cost vaccine, since 100 million people America fully vaccinated, real problem would likely know like said, I‚Äôm probably exposed Covid daily basis I‚Äôm sure antibodies point dragging herd immunity isn‚Äôt problem.

And tested antibodies going world fully eradicate anyways.

Vaccines eliminate diseases. proven technology. race mutations right now, that's impedes couple years capitalists aren‚Äôt rushing vaccines keep markets crashing nah I‚Äôll pass lol

That's excuse take it. actual excuses get vaccinated. China controlled arrivals policies world, flights India Pakistan (and really significant amount border crossing either) CDC guidance Pfizer trials measure efficacy one week post shot #2  crazy hell bent antivaxxers killing people one way another. wanted y‚Äôall socially distance WAY covid, sayin‚Äô. 807,804 first dose shots.

Come exports baby! crazy Canada ahead em. oh god no.... end May, we‚Äôre COVID season. best chance wipe thing vaccine immunity. Kids school couple months help too. think got nerve damage feel tingling vaccine arm pins needle week first dose way avoid problem make vaccine compulsory.

... Maritimes months Even medical workers/elderly aren‚Äôt fully vaccinated yet Japanese people hating Olympics much now, really think it‚Äôs good idea prioritise athletes? Really? Thank link, Google translate worked excellently. Nibud book looks helpful manage expectations expenditures. thank that, bookmarked it.

55% undeniably significant. I‚Äôm definitely weighing many factors made Netherlands rise top options list (EU member, proximity rail, walkable city options, open liberal culture, language, non-Arctic, etc) I‚Äôm curious, housing cost percentage something feel applies major EU cities? also see lot housing issues (cost, availability) posted Berlin, Paris, Milan, wondering specifically NL issue Europe general? country dictatorship cesspool, ideals work fought independence ensure that. also live tiny country like vietnam, jungle population dense, course would know actually knew anything vietnam miss announcements last week U.S. exporting millions doses (including Pfizer)weekly Mexico, Canada, Brazil India?

Or sarcastic something? realize projecting take long. Chicago looks like trajectory re-open mostly fully (except masks) mid June. Quebec mostly open minor restrictions last June Dec? Ontario was. Lots places required outside. Tagging onto comment instead starting own, I‚Äôm pretty sure boss (US, tech/entertainment sector, bunch nerds working him) secret anti-vaxxer twisting knots trying figure make people come back office also anti vax.

I‚Äôm fully vaccinated vaguely amused conundrum, hugely so. mean also declining seasonal reasons.

Infections dropped last spring too. one miserable person, clearly love pandemic. Good. country ran room morgues use military transport dead bodies overwhelmed system source says basically know shit variant... number new coronavirus cases borough Fairbanks seat, North Star, risen 253 percent past two weeks. positivity rate doubled since March, 10 percent 5 percent, hospitalizations Fairbanks Memorial Hospital, area‚Äôs hospital, hit record ‚ÄúThis place fire Covid,‚Äù Dr. Barb Creighton, internist Fairbanks Memorial Hospital, said meeting.

For God's sake get vaccinated people! Cool sure replied me. Alright man good day ‚ÄúI know I‚Äù lol  I'm skeptical everything, including (very skeptical, sounds like menstrual cycle synchronization myth long ago), there's reason conclude sort side-effects people around vaccinated people. Wait data concluding anything. Nope think anything factually wrong wrote regarding vaccines experimental going normal testing?  Everything still open bar Guadalajara could probably sell around amount pre covid weekends there's still curfew capacity restrictions still pretty damn tough. nightclubs, stripclubs, casinos 100% open reason.

But also suffered LOT december &amp; january, I'm joking say could compared India right official daily report specify, likely means new cases unvaccinated.

Most medical frontline staff received Pfizer shots done January February.

So far cleaner, nurse 2 doctors infected vaccinated.

The nurse 1 doctor shown symptoms doctor cleaner asymptomatic. Exactly.

The story complicated, many different factors playing different places varying degrees. We're enter nationwide lockdown pretty soon apparently, issue government likes surprise everyone. Also, rallies gatherings banned now.  Good luck going school work. tide turning hold outs. Oh know I'm minority. learned long time ago get hell lot work done offering carrot instead stick. frustrating thing cant get enough staff even level pay. 

Yes enough people vaccinated cases back control reason service industry shouldnt allowed open.

That said I'm also ontario Montreal. I'm sure situation like ontario still fucked moment. government quick lift restrictions slow impose them. goes back original comment picking scab. stuck strict measures earlier waited little longer service industry open close again. They're getting fucked right even funny. would easier leave closed month longer. 

Our restrictions haphazard best based science. Things low risk like golfing closed things kept open closed long ago. disaster.

What mean *it didn't*? situation people refuse vaccinate "" them."" people rest unvaccinated world keep variants going, could eventually compromise vaccines.

This really need accept 25-30% population refusing vaccinate, need make global vaccination effort supply outstrips demand. people allow remain unvaccinated greater risk run vaccines compromised.

In other, certain regions, thousands die regionally winter, local outbreaks, somewhat like flu, we've got new, solvable health burden costs lots money human lives.

Getting vaccine excellent efficacy win. win people developed it, win people take it.

Not choosing option two though, loss everyone constitutes failed society places dont take it. underscores comprehensive failure education. agree US. sounds like lot Europe basically locked homes anyway past year.

What 60% total population least partially vaccinated 1/5th total population infected. means around 70% immunity COVID-19. might enough older variants, possible enough newer variants. assuming vaccine natural immunity 100%, not. another variant pops due partially immune population less effected ""old"" immunity (like making immunity old variants 20% less effective) even less protection population.

I'm hypochondriac temporarily living country reputation bad healthcare. alternative, course, returning America, healthcare crisis bankrupt you. yea...I'm rushing return normal.  mean, weighed &lt;100 pounds age 16, grandmother definitely 80s (she tiny woman), presumably already considered already approved population.   give correct pill doses physically small adults, like people Dwarfism, women 2 standard deviations average height weight? That's good sign, sign imcopetence respective states target vulnerable population. Even live examples India Brazil (and US honestly probably better rolled vaccine fast) people still believe virus serious threat. There's always people saying things like lockdowns damaging virus Florida's numbers prove lockdowns/restrictions nothing. looks like what's really happening ""successful"" places restrictions gambling happened win; India kept pushing though eventually luck ran out. Relying individual assessment risk really bad pretty stupid anything anti-science hysteria yet are. Im quite small I‚Äôm always weighed use dosing. realize meds different vaccines I‚Äôd concerned you‚Äôre prescribed like that. app sign using ID eligible sign go get vaccine 
It say I'm eligible 
We astrazeneka pfizer vaccines simple logical reason besides calculation error comes demographics. population rural areas less young people rollout vaccine re: demographics driving numbers.  wonder pill prescription doses lower countries low average height low obesity?

In America, standard deviation height weight large. short skinny Americans started using recommended dosages like Vietnam?  Congrats karma whore cheap shot you‚Äôre mistaking blockchain Bitcoin. 

(And ignore first part reply honest mistake ;)    2 deaths TOTAL &lt;50 bracket comorbidities. per day.

Besides, want compare way also gotta adjust vaccine continuation. still worth it, especially young.

The risk getting COVID Denmark first place also really, REALLY low.   concept long covid roundly dismissed ‚Äúfear mongering‚Äù along lines w chronic illness always dismissed medical establishment public large. ‚ÄúAs long covid doesn‚Äôt kill you‚Äôll totally fine‚Äù mantra year now. absurd many survived SARS infections faced years health issues case, would different here?

Doctors who‚Äôve downplayed virus and/or ignored possibility chronic illness stripped medical licenses, elected officials who‚Äôve done removed office. It‚Äôs beyond awful young people (teenagers christ sake, younger) face long-term health issues virus that‚Äôs easily transmissible. known better potential things pay price willful, often politically-motivated ignorance. shouldnt worry. Barring vaccine-resistant explosion, corona anything significant anywhere US beyond June. still exist obviously finally actually reduced much threat flu (even less, given corona vaccines better flu vaccines probably also much widely adopted). confuse skepticism paranoia.

I mean, literally point. fact say makes question understand word skeptical means. 

It's okay skeptical something convinced of, long unreasonable.

 I'm skeptical masks effective reducing transmission much told, I'm confident better nothing, comply. 

I'm skeptical vaccines effective say short turnaround time, I'm confident better nothing, got shots.

I'm skeptical COVID even big health risk told, I'm confident measures they've asked us take unreasonable comply. comply. 

Any statements, posted own, would downvoted heavily would called stupid anti-science, called liar told follow rules. messaging become toxic eat everything told ""scientists"" literally cause everything bad that's happened past 18 months.

It stop. want people start taking vaccine, stop acting like uptake hesitancy makes stupid bad person. People allowed doubts disparaging ingratiate ideas them. hope so.  son 12 plan get vaccinated soon possible. daughter 10 wait while. 

It troublesome seen large drop vaccinations last couple weeks.  good news easy get son appointment right away. happens 4th month? directly require specific things. already schools example. Good. time. I'm willing bet believe body autonomy issues.  crowded sidewalks Brooklyn? neighborhoods LA literally walking 4 feet behind, beside ppl blocks end, foot traffic increased much. case approved yet UK neither? getting doses right Let‚Äôs hope Canada gets together us adults first. I'm sure individuals experience anxiety, entire city?

where live, baseball games close getting sold (even limit)

when team goes road, cities selling out. Nationwide guidance states localities make mandates that‚Äôs man child! they're vaccinated, hospitalizations drop like rock. scan many articles declaring ‚ÄúPfizer support‚Äù vs reality situation. 

It‚Äôs absolutely misinformation occlude reality situation. right, nothing wrong two vaccines... like they've killed people Denmark COVID age group. Nothing see /s Thanks. articles that?  Yeah, means mocking especially actually trying learn more. Topics infectious disease, microbiology/virology, biochem, etc. pre-pandemic interest mine mother specifically worked R&amp;D developing diagnostic tests, including coronaviruses (and worked too) kind pre-existing knowledge base build of.

However, think enjoyable hobby encourage others get piece called ‚Äúspike protein.‚Äù



I think intentions emphasize piece virus, whole virus vaccine. Pre-pandemic antivax information took advantage people's misunderstandings whole inactivated virus live attenuated vaccines promoted ""the vaccine gives virus"" they(the CDC) probably trying play whole virus involved. Unfortunately pull new things bumholes say things like ""vaccines change DNA"". hard argue logically care logic. AZ vaccine great vaccine care people think vaccine. unmitigated good fight Covid-19. sounds like sepsis due weakened immune system (infected blood multiple infections).

Was ventilator?

Sorry, hope able make full recovery. deadly side-effects published EMA MRHA. Astra-Zeneca vaccin basically deadly young people Covid itself. people thirty even true Covid figures high. Australia would mean 120 young people getting serious side-effects, quarter would die half would life-changing disabilities. makes absolutely sense use vaccin younger people (women particular) country like Australia safer vaccins exist. results happen get X amount people infected covid, order able compare placebo group vs vaccine group. guess waiting get amount people order release data idea reported vs real COVID counts, information China's numbers low? population billions would thought would look much like India, reported deaths 5,000. I've read articles detail extreme lockdowns were. authoritarian government really full quarantine everyone extent Western population would agree to. kind control actually work reporting real numbers? understand different scenario, someone chops feet recover. They've lost something permanently they're alive well. 

With covid, still dont know long term effects contracting it, seems organ function like brain lungs operate full capacity 2 people dying per day. 5 total. two points cancel other, thanks. ACCPET risk orders magnitude lower happen. everyone eligible EXCEPT total morons want vaccinated.  common ppl battling long-term covid ICU's. pray &amp; family. Virologists suspect patients like uncle give rise new mutations virus multiplies &amp; tries evade advanced therapies. Even rare bacteria proliferate patients given immuno-suppressants anti-virals. organization last week said okay wear mask outside vaccinated? Yeesh, we'll waiting eons. I'm still taking full precautions go work, vaccination rate low ultra high risk family members. Also type place work type people frequent it.

I would say assess live risk make informed decision makes feel comfortable.

I think relax start see people locally vaccinated miracle occurs, infection rates go considerably, also want see scientists saying new variants little road. kids family vaccinated. Especially one risk complications.  Progress made still many illogical/contradictory statements. There's reason wearing mask outdoors. Social distancing surface sanitation theater disease airborne. Vaccinated people allowed go life normal (I realize challenges regard proving vaccination).  wait (allegedly) another month change risk individuals get vaccinated loosen restrictions everyone

So basically keeping restrictions everyone? Why? pediatrician, it‚Äôs sad duty inform 400lb 12 year olds. 

Also vaccines aren‚Äôt going dosing medications do. kid hits 90-100lbs(ish) time use adult dosing, tends around age 12 most. I‚Äôve heard, actually give smaller doses 12-15 kids. It‚Äôs 6-10 month process usually. FDA EUA mere weeks. 

The best time begin increasing vaccine production capacity today wasn‚Äôt started yesterday. There‚Äôs need delay further. companies Pfizer moderna rejected cooperate plan fall would‚Äôve vaccine production going now. Barely anyone dying Denmark COVID. **2** people 50 die total since pandemic started (without co-mobidities) **0** 30. We've vaccinated everyone wanted vaccine 50 within next couple weeks, basically 50s risk contracting COVID Denmark. two people age group died COVID since pandemic started, means vaccine already killed far young people COVID would have. pretty safe say - least Denmark - pretty stupid hand vaccines deadly side effects barely anyone dying. news? knew last April It‚Äôs risk now.

And risk can't get vaccinated actual health reasons.   Capacity restrictions, random things closed, masks everywhere, etc. -- none normal, feel normal. right healthy people choosing get vaccinated awful. Herd immunity requires viable individuals immunized, otherwise can‚Äôt immunized always risk. Yeah, perrsonally expect COVAX - initiative set end Covid-19 lower income countries limited budget - essentially buy expensive vaccine. Unless ""lower tiered"" price large percentage original price. Let's hope anyway. isn‚Äôt. That‚Äôs definition. one ever says masks means fully reopened. New Yorkers glad able go meet activities even means wearing mask crowd. 

This huge good news city. I'm worried millions millions infections India elsewhere, infections among US children. Put worry bulk risk is.

The problem India large part population poor little/no access proper sanitation health care. areas densely populated. estimate short constantly lengthening trial period goes. disingenuous say vaccines last 6 months death conclusively linked vaccine far? course Florida needs new governor, one *science based* willing put financial considerations aside. current governor wants state wide open, sales tax revenue.  Personal responsibility means get vaccine without carrot/reward end it. fellow August wedding New York. Sending positive vibes!  33 million Covid US, that's 10% us. half US adults vaccinated (about 1/3 population), we‚Äôre seeing pretty massive drop number folks getting first dose. 

Despite opening vaccinations adults 2 weeks ago, first dose rates half 4 weeks ago. happy news! I'm jealous kids 7 10. tough explaining young kids they'll need mask distance longer, they're two smart cookies, I'm sure they'll understand. Get tenth what? 2 people total?? understand since december 2019 2 people age 50 died COVID-19, meanwhile 2 people age 50 would die used J&amp;J AZ vaccines all. Everyone age 50 done vaccinations soon. Bill gates incorrect every step way. Ok Dr. Reddit. Read loud clear. Good luck natural immunity there.üëå  Something like that. AZ vaccine thought would lead 5 cases serious blood clotting. hand prevent one hospitalisation ICU.

J&amp;J seems fewer cases serious blood clotting ordereda higher number vaccine. also month ahead pandemic even control risk catching covid decreasing anyone know anything came initial hypothesis MMR vaccine somewhat effective Sars-CoV-2 children facing less severe infection less long term side effects? actually pretty clear vascular disease published last June.  ""wide variety seemingly unconnected complications"" linked parts ACE2 - angiotensin II pathway disregulation.

 ""In setting enhanced ACE2 deficiency produced viral invasion, marked dysregulation ‚Äòadverse‚Äô *ACE‚ÜíAngiotensin II‚ÜíAT1* axis ‚Äòprotective‚Äô *ACE2‚ÜíAngiotensin1-7‚ÜíMas* axis would contribute enhance progression inflammatory thrombotic processes.""

&amp;#x200B;

This study shows spike damaging. Masks fully reopened. masks come off? Give break. actually look pharma spending, R&amp;D always excuse given 

1.	A fuckload development comes public funding 
2.	Executive shareholder compensation plus marketing way better funded sure based on. official EU goal end July, everyone offered jab end June anyway. NJ offering free beer get vaccinated May. Really wish retroactive lol Maybe semantics, actual headline article clearly state FDA ‚Äúauthorize‚Äù vaccine, approve OP suggests. assume similar Emergency Use Authorization vaccine people 16+. 

As provide literature get vaccine, none vaccines approved yet FDA, EUA‚Äôd. 

For record, I‚Äôm fully vaccinated support others getting vaccine. distinction may important people. Let‚Äôs spread misinformation.  severe financial consequences wasting doses. Including prevented recieving more.

If doses danger going waste, setting street corner pop-ups 24x7 they're gone absolutely way enforce people largely allowed walk around drive around like, impact behaviour anyway creates social stigma meeting indoors. reduces transmission, even bit, done job. 11 year old 5‚Äô2‚Äù 110lbs. know won‚Äôt able get approval, give brief summary reason? children‚Äôs immune systems different similarly sized adults? Weird single link medium... ever reached herd immunity flu?

I thought goal vaccinations turn COVID pandemic nuisance.   basically removing capacity limits name only. remove will, told wrote something anonyme online üòä thanks man.. kind üôÇ Oh, understand fully - think perspective very, wrong. Restrictions aren‚Äôt negotiating chip - they‚Äôre part necessary response public health crisis, like vaccines are. isn‚Äôt ‚Äúeither or‚Äù situation; need both.

The UK reopening despite mediocre first-doses-only vaccination effort, also maintained strict lockdown metrics improved. US mired mini fourth wave continue exercise caution. Relaxing restrictions early far, far worse maintaining little longer necessary. someone lives county close today result renewed outbreaks, overaggressive mentality championing directly impacting community.

The incentive get vaccinated *to actually solve problem*. Normalcy isn‚Äôt something government creates - it‚Äôs end result taking right actions fix problem. Masking public transit something implement based risk metrics, right clear US unlikely position relax least July.

Extending transportation mask mandate summer makes predictable enforceable, hopefully means eventually relaxed need return. like child man! wouldn't, numbers Sunday Monday artificially lowered reduced reporting weekends. Numbers Tuesday artificially high, include deaths reported weekend.

10 *actual* deaths day would represent decline. every person country getting tested every week? We've got plenty AZ stock J&amp;J piling deliveries expected days... yeah, we've got vaccines, we've got people happy take them, but.. yeah.. New York neighbors, New Jersey Connecticut, welcome back crowds May 19, state officials said Monday, major step region epicenter coronavirus Restaurants, offices, retail stores, theaters, museums, barber shops, amusement parks gyms fitness centers allowed operate full capacity first time since restrictions adopted last year prevent spread virus. Thanks taking time answer Bill gates advocated closing Oxford vaccine horrific. also continually refuse evidence IP blocking preventing increased production capacity. 

You‚Äôre nothing espousing lobbyists libertarian like bullshit suppositions.

Not mention public investments made totaling billions dollars. I‚Äôll admit it‚Äôs bit sadistic, hear vast majority deaths unvaccinated people makes smirk. Self correction. Public-funded R&amp;D Oxford/Astra  let know. talk doctor next week. hot second shot last week, last week chemo. would bit shame, didnt work. üòá come bribe someone kielbasa get then? Figure speech. never made individual sense young people shelter place. 

Even there's argument made least vulnerable required shelter place, follow logically people fully vaccinated also required shelter place.    Hope get soon! neither. guideline, could get fined. be, check anything never really have. People age(30) desparate get shot. want get lives. We're looking closed summer festivals, sporting events etc gonna go through.

I'd happily take J&amp;J vaccine. would think second vaccine acts boost already primed immune system, helping react slightly efficiently, also extend immunity. pediatric one done vaccines childhood diseases.. two three series, like mumps, measles, pertussis, polio, etc. 

It interesting see J&amp;J conducts pediatric trials outcomes, one dose regimen they‚Äôve formulated adults. vaccine Doses last months still frozen, exactly spoiling yet.

It's thawed, unused doses go waste. Well allow ""get back normal"". Even completing vaccination could still spread it/mutate it. nation past minimum threshold immunity take root us quell tide pandemic need continue masking/distancing (in circumstances).

People need stop acting like moment complete vaccinations peachy stop distancing masking general (obviously determined safe interact exclusively vaccinated people outdoors/not close).  Even vaccination? live economy already open? places precautions place nothing closed tracheotomy. intubated before. weird emphasis saying one sepsis due bacteria. cousin doctor constantly visits check him. Based timeline w 12-15 it'd place 12-15 September vaccine available college students working class people age. choose get people avoid you, avoid people maybe nothing, maybe breaks becomes useless 3 months one day, maybe turns godzilla, maybe there's 50/50 split first two options across batches. 

With vaccines medicines, evaluate results fact. put samples fridge January tested March, verify efficacy 3 months storage (plus time test.) there's January batch get looked June, maybe eventually they'll able say good six months. Second dose moderna, felt pretty 5 days slight headache (even 101 fever 1.5 days) suddenly 100%.

Everybody know who's said felt days. remember correctly, Pfizer started trials 6 month 11 year old children hopefully soon! maybe stupid question new vaccines get approved future (hopefuly) covid common today? get longer trial period? *chin diaper preferred nomenclature, dude. belive going doctor really option, learn rationalize good, least really necessary. course can. trust make right decision. Much politicians criticising someone lives beach town tell mostly everyone ok. Last summer nearly equal summer weather sucks. make much money would have, ok. thoughts news reports aren‚Äôt likely reach herd immunity?

Scare mongering. Herd immunity binary thing one day country next day number reached. We're track 67% adults vaccinated end month 20%+ unvaxxed likely natural immunity prior infection. Might optimal, end month enough. likely hood another shutdown due variant unlikely ? Huh - talking about? virus that? It‚Äôs measles chicken pox. Vaccines basically mimic infection, without symptoms. Twitter, Facebook etc private companies, right whatever fuck want long legal. think want government mandating can't said social media. always confused Republican approach this. want govt restriction, want govt regulation force private companies unban people private website. gives? Pfizer's phase 1/2 tried 3 different doses, 10ug, 30ug, 100ug. 100ug less strong immune response side effects 30ug, also strong immune response. 10ug generate strong enough immune response partcipants.

They would done similar trials 12+ year olds. I'm hoping see publish data.

I think would harder distribute different doses. kids need half dose, could pull half volume vials. doubt factor all. may blown. mentioned npr health expert also say yeah vaccine rate could ramp bit take little longer reach heard immunity. think came today said herd immunity likely excited go restrictions removed. going right don‚Äôt see point going bars sit table can‚Äôt mingle anyone. Might well drink home lol. Soon!  x-com players seriuos trouble seems healthy children able fight disease naturally, old/those pre-existing conditions aren't, hence need vaccine them. don‚Äôt think want compare China done far vs US done saying I‚Äôm short estimate long? agree data updated daily let kids (8 12) go back school last 9 weeks really suffering emotionally, within 3 weeks whole family got sick. Luckily wasn‚Äôt covid, body prepared get sick well year. kicked ass 4-5 days  could give vaccine drive real shot arm!

says 100th person. It‚Äôs really bad I‚Äôm at. It‚Äôs truly baffling young vaccinated person still afraid. think unfortunately media messaging it‚Äôs encouraging this. People need see something work (their irrational anxiety) ppl doubled it, usually judge others same. reputable source this?   Part NY/CT lifting restrictions. Everyone seems trying things region. I‚Äôm assuming lessen temptation drive state lines restrictions lift elsewhere.

And yes, I‚Äôve heard people float idea unironically. That's cool! husband vaccinated April, there's breweries list tried. We'll probably go get beers support breweries running promo!  wonder ‚Äúcarrot‚Äù encourage vaccine hesitant. 

Germany pretty well, latest yougov poll shows 30% adults wanting vaccinated, enough herd immunity.

It seems unfair otherwise, likely build resentment generations. countries relaxing rules slowly everyone, rather faster vaccinated. already started hit early points wide spread immunity causing cases decreasing. 

Some areas going well places deal breaks. biontech devlop it? pfizer manufacturer? mean vaccine passport international travel. ban vaccine passports domestic shit like going walmart, home depot, gas station, etc.

The feds handle kind ""vaccine passport"" international travel way yellow card attached passport. minor political hype, nothing get excited about.   wouldn‚Äôt worried chewed out. big concept mental health putting first sometimes ok disappointing people/having people accept choices. 

There segment population lives deep illogical fear. It‚Äôs pretty wild. guarantee woman still travels automobile multiple times week. I'm also uncomfortable around needles. look way. Honestly less 2 seconds, barely pinch. okay. I‚Äôm definitely ‚Äúnormal‚Äù things pre-vaccination, find hard immediately go back normal. Especially since case counts pretty steady area last weeks. Hoping case counts drop mental barrier go away Okay thanks. Like said based timeline 12-15 5-11 moves rate they'd complete August likely approved around time line following. speculation based science that's already done expect issues aside figuring dosing. Lol even enforced mate USA update first dose shots:

470,722 first dose shots. Last week 991,183

7 day rolling avg 935,439. 1,009,790 yesterday.

147.5m age 16+ first dose - ~55.4% (147m - ~55.2% yesterday)

70% (~186.4m people)- 79.1% way done
______


Rough day need remember end game. 

Hopefully 12-15 gets approved week see nice little bump them. Numbers adjusted approved. Last weeks data complete date death. latest 7-day period 83 deaths, averaging 12.

The 110 figure including deaths before. well makes feel safe it. IDC long people like try force beliefs me.  enforced unless somebody massive party. criminal offense nobody gonna get caught, police underfunded bother. Plenty people ignoring it, nobody really cares now. 

The logic absolutely blitz covid early spring mass vaccinations lockdown restrictions gone next month we're position we're likely running far quicker European nations.  top 5 all-time comment Maybe travel back time 100 years properly fund public education hold true vaccines also specific mrna cannot give anything return I‚Äôll gladly take kielbasa lol  Thanks reply. 

The reasons suggested blockchain are:

Distributed

Trustless 

Open source. 

Now, agree fraud issue always is. there‚Äôs ‚Äúpermanent fraud‚Äù blockchain, invalidated via (higher level) blockchain meta data, also creates public audit record. 

Databases always face question audit inaccuracies, wasn‚Äôt point OP, think 3 points? acceptable here. low uptake all, fact like 95%. Unfair make rules people offered jab yet. However next month restrictions gone. Yes, deaths today reported later well. Begin taking credit vaccine developed another company. Obesity different much extra fat mass cause huge difference hormonally average person. really need see studies see really ""mass related"" vs fat mass body fat percentage. could related insulin resistance hormonal issues. study making conclusion interpreting it. vaccinating 10 year old soon asap, 16 year old sister already received 1st dose Pfizer NYC Yeah store's pharmacist sweet little asian lady, seems overworked right now, still nice be. Thankful hard-working pharmacy employees yourself.  He'll gifted percussive maintenance sure.   vaccinators much practice giving shots don‚Äôt even feel all. sit look way count like fifteen. It‚Äôs fast. 

Also get Covid bad youd stuffed full way needles. it‚Äôs getting quick one potentially avoid bunch IVs road. Probably big deal. time states get vaccine passport system place matter. Even doubt would open even passport comparison anti passport states. can't change headlines wife fully vaccinated pre covid planning road trip France/Belgium. thrilled actually year. mean ? Passports ? vaccinations ? travel papers mentioned bible ), smallpox vaccines required first 1944. course, COVID-19 testing/vaccines could required 2019 :) can't change headline answer you. reason explain feel way feel, end day, irrelevant. still done I've asked (mask, distance, vaccinate-ive done it). 

You're *literally* proving point; difference opinion calling paranoid, anti-science, etc. enough compliance, I'm aligned belief system I'm committing thought crime.

People like can't see past nose. We're talking Olympics.

I agree Oktoberfest probably uncertain financially viable, although would probably fine October.  Fully agreed. Masks absolutely covid restriction. trying sell us? Hospitals absolutely still catch coronavirus fully vaccinated vaccines. chances hospitalization death lower. looks vaccinated people contagious (not carrier) catch coronavirus unvaccinated person. 

There meaningful data yet vaccinated people catching coronavirus long covid symptoms. data long covid people getting vaccinated (post infection) relieving symptoms. That's definitely concern issue medical testing (most medical testing tends done adult white males catch issues always dosing sex related side effects) every medicine dosed based body size. Wear earbuds listen music. Tell person giving shot anxiety beforehand. panic attacks, so, maybe consider taking medication prior vaccination prescribed any. share research/evidence back up? conversation parents teen girls especially concerned potential unknowns vaccination girls puberty (with specific mention vaccines may impact uterine wall). 

This area expertise try research concern, find anything. want able share documented research/evidence potential unknowns vaccines. relaxing restrictions bit everyone, happening countries. gonna great week! . agree think great idea. I'm glad got mine 2 months ago happily pay $6 beer.  Sounds like sofware inganeer I‚Äôd wait see cases drop record low levels see stays. would also helpful anxious people CDC released data variants vs vaccines. Right people getting anecdotal info Twitter isn‚Äôt helping. Luckily Israel CDC really conducting tests. 

On flip side also people staying mainly want wait till mask mandate gone. relatives don‚Äôt want spend lot vacation bunch mask restaurant pictures. masks feel vacation would less fun prices aren‚Äôt cheap anymore them. may ever reach herd immunity, vaccination still bring cases manageable level. 

Hopefully, treatments severe cases become available, unvaccinated person become sick.

Once vaccine open every age group including pediatrics, covid won‚Äôt problem now. fact, may well kids get shot, see end crisis point since adults major risk group. 

We don‚Äôt necessarily need herd immunity things vastly improve. Wait really? Right, exactly message I'm saying they're sending - now, *still* think risky count fall. comment responded said pessimistic, things take long time plan, indicate they're taking pessimistic view things - is, there's reasonable chance able happen planned it. study effectively current vaccines indian strain? You‚Äôre downvoted used wrong word, sentiment there. understand value vaccinated it‚Äôs importance us reaching herd immunity, really resent ‚Äúvaccine passports‚Äù. vaccinated person infected COVID spread virus easily unvaccinated asymptotic. say, it‚Äôs hell lot less symptomatic person, it‚Äôs sure shit zero.

The vaccine falsely touted cure-all end spread virus that‚Äôs really case‚Ä¶and I‚Äôm vaccinated. They're also moving back behind closed doors fans due latest outbreak, that's argument holding Oktoberfest IMO, original context discussion. it‚Äôs anxiety, others think it‚Äôs tiredness. particular tired change.

Emotionally we‚Äôve lot year. Personally little fear COVID; I‚Äôm concerned spreading it. haven‚Äôt got energy enthusiasm try organise social events, may may happen, require much work before. think end year life mostly normal. Many vaccinated others either gotten sick covid symptomatic. covid always you‚Äôll likely need revaccinated. Hopefully severity covid diminish point becomes like common cold. Also let‚Äôs hope aren‚Äôt new viruses pop near future. nobody tried stop court? justifications restriction given anymore. Would help close eyes nurse even takes needle?

It's pretty quick, inject vaccine fatty part arm, like they're trying find vein draw blood. Based article announcement? I‚Äôve commented users phobia came back said actually less scary anticipated got shot. needle tiny won‚Äôt feel it. Turn away relax arm, it‚Äôll half second. go anyway variant? regret cautious achieve nothing? They‚Äôre fat people know refusing full FDA approval likely get does. They're using excuse right talking point anti-vaxx crowd. I'm sure that's true everyone, among people know absolutely case. matter scientist government leader would say. I'm one ""nEw nOrMaL"" nutters, fully reopen reserved mean COVID restrictions businesses/events. Yea small businesses can‚Äôt really afford implement systems? 

Keep reduced capacity? Cost reason production limited. IP costs waved small anyway. It‚Äôs production know raw material limits. vaccine. America 3 deaths 8 million doses, anybody knew side effects could treat effectively. complete opinion piece actually evidence. Bill Gates' interview Sky, I've quoted above, actually disagree anything said, choosing instead use blanket statements want give away IP clearly IP

Then give example _one_ factory Bangladesh ""shiny new equipment Germany"" waiting licence manufacture vaccines. absolutely nothing Bill Gates' said - quality control, expertise, infrastructure. Absolutely nothing

Then talk Bill Gates' links pharma. shit Sherlock, he's working global vaccination healthcare programmes decades, course industry links. Give evidence links used kill people, harm people whatever actually wanted claim here

And dude, starts speculating malaria vaccine without actual evidence blocked IP, global warming research initiative talking global consensus deployment fact technology developed deployed moment

Tl;dr they're grasping straws complain about, especially since actual rebuttal Bill Gates' nothing Bill Gates. Talks IP problem companies giving IP, whereas Bill Gates' point IP infrastructure quality control problem

.

And here's kicker, India developed vaccine called Covaxin, also producing vaccines license. infrastructure nothing IP issue, India suffering worst case current pandemic? IP block stopped India producing vaccine ones already producing licence? [Its estimated 7 million Americans get vaccine know 

The young getting vaccinated failure healthcare system. Huh? least allowed vaxxed people visit homes...  want get vaccinated. pretty severe fear needles. opportunity get J&amp;J would happen once. anybody tips calm down? extreme panic type fear, fainting kind. This. Business going accept everyone, regardless whether vaccinated not. We‚Äôre getting point COVID isn‚Äôt going hold people back things anymore. you‚Äôre afraid COVID, you‚Äôre likely going get vaccinated, you‚Äôre afraid COVID, amount precautions going entice go somewhere. contrary, you‚Äôre vaccinated intentions vaccinated, you‚Äôre probably likely want go place doesn‚Äôt care, place top precautions. 

OP right, free market decide this. don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs going outcome think is. came COVID February -- far appears one lucky ones severe long-term symptoms, despite ""immunity"" I'm still really nervous going malls, stores restaurants. Reinfection possible, especially variants going around, COVID still freaks out. 

Getting first vaccine dose couple weeks, maybe two weeks second dose I'll bit relaxed going out. Listen, don‚Äôt want get vaccine, don‚Äôt. don‚Äôt come crying you‚Äôre death bed hospital begging mercy. choice want. stupid choice I‚Äôll happy continue life fully vaccinated two weeks ago. I‚Äôm pushing throat get vaccinated, don‚Äôt push throat saying ignorant stuff.  US really needs something vaccine demand... like, dropping like rock we're even 50%... bad government tie stimulus check vaccine. Easiest way get people vaccinated pay them.  Pretty well them. Chemotherapy broadly suppresses immune system immune cells rapidly divide like cancer cells.

The fact cancer patients developing robust immunity surprising medical community need reach herd immunity. 62% NJ adults first dose, second know exact numbers J&amp;J, similar Astrazeneca, 5 barely 100.000 died due AZ Norway. safe assume continue vaccine even people going die result vaccinations, making much 28 deaths total, especially one dose vaccine like J&amp;J especially Denmark since enough vaccinate entire population. Dude, boggles mind sometimes much pack away Thanks proving point.

Yeah, totally proved point pointing none ""skepticism"" logic behind refused answer every single ""why"" good enough people things they're asked do, need think way they're told think well.

Holy strawman argument batman!

You continue paranoid, stop trying pretend skepticism. believe official study wraps summer data available August, one I‚Äôm thinking contains adult data. wasn‚Äôt centered pediatric outcomes. Four months long extension. airline world operates based quarters, leisure travel booked 60 days advance. extension next quarter. Changing midstream significant logistical challenges airlines, affects people used existence mandate decide whether want travel summer.

The assertion someone going decide get vaccinated mask mandate airplanes might lifted August July patently absurd. Scary stuff He's great sports, super tech guy wife works tech company says knows boss already. wiz hardware sofware one better examples journalism publication, feel guilty. assume u mean undercounted, correct isnt case.

Keep vaccinating!   good news given bad situation Portugal January. exactly talking about?  aware Pfizers history? J&amp;J? seen products FDA approved? seen fines criminal behaviour? No. vaccination will, worst, make uncomfortable day two.

Hazard pay, maybe reduction home teachers. Money talks wear masks forever - they're piece cloth really affect live. People get tired wearing heat lol. almost virus people tolerate wearing seen numbers indicating would actually change? public statements speak broad platitudes, meanwhile vaccines already manufactured staggering numbers around world.

It feels like folks talking based idealized vision world work, would actually help. taking hammer problem scalpel would work better.

Instead focus voluntary/compulsory licensing deals (which better protecting trade secrets), cutting red tape supply chains, Covax generally (which already well underway helping supply vaccines low income countries). Pass another stimulus, offer thousand bucks shot (twice much J&amp;J). Retroactive anyone already got vaccinated, course.

So saying basically useless.  definitely would, many won't. kids can't go school, can't go work, gym kicked out, etc. controversial topic US population polarized, could definitely work far getting numbers vaccinated up.

I've seen suggested perhaps best thing use vaccine passports traffic light, ""easy pass"" lane. Allow unvaccinated access, however require relentless testing. example test unvaccinated workers students every day, etc. whole article projection conjecture based vaccine hesitancy polls.

False, also interviews relevant experts.

Suppose (to make numbers easy) 50% country get disease 50% vaccinate.

If *random* 50% vaccinate 75% public either vaccinated (50ppt) experienced disease (50% 50% = another 25ppt).

But choice vaccinate random.

- People COVID *more likely* want vaccine.
- Ditto people household members likely high overlap vaccinated COVID. think also going decent spike number 18-25s getting shots next couple weeks finals - know hesitant get last month would put potential 2nd dose side effects right end semester working nonstop finals finishing term projects.

Because reality wide swaths country entire states struggling get 25% 30% population vaccinated, nobody lining get shots day day empty vaccination appointments. want somebody lie tell herd immunity possible environment?

It's sobering reality, author delivers way alarmist all.

Show otherwise. point is? vaccinating child selfish shit. part keep kid people safe. Seems like EU learned lesson, making deals production capacity place. Pretty sure PPE oversupply point. OK, see point. necessarily disagree you. I'm trying address inevitable ""but..."" responses vaccine passports. Death everything. Losing smell, asthma, heart problems... exist also. think great news. variety reasons. know age range ( rule ) get severe reactions virus older people, I'd still feel better children age ability get it. dead arm well very, obviously huge caveat doctor medical professional, *have* blood clot leg (while recovering surgery repair torn muscle), advice given doctors always keep leg elevated, use heating pad, wear compression stockings.

I'd go urgent care center looked soon financially justify it. thing I've ever experienced I'd liken feeling like I'd shot staph infection.

There‚Äôs difference insurance companies rewarding customers healthy/whatever effectively penalizing sick (in case, vaccinated sick). I‚Äôm telling law that‚Äôs books. Analogies perfect. point need perfect understanding something use safely effectively.

We've making vaccines now. may chemists we've got lots experienced cooks. Yes, 200 000 couple weeks ago. used 65+. take test. vaccine fine, (particularly first shot) likely fully protective quite yet want know covid exposure isolate appropriately. read that?

Non-white groups disproportionately infected. politician pundits sure. ain‚Äôt gonna use AZ ordered (only used 65+ vaccinated 1 dose). someone use em, disagree reason use em people 65, is. minimum. maximum. link cellular studies?

The real world data prime example uncontrolled data give misleading results. UK instance, getting pfizer shots 1.7x risk ratio vs getting AZ shots *before* got shots. pfizer shots mostly given healthcare workers start surge, AZ shots given group care elderly residents. first shot risk ratio healthcare workers (again surge) rose even 1.7x (now surrounded vaccinated people) group care residents.

The trial data confounding factors, quite clear mRNA vaccines substantially better reducing symptoms infections AZ. Nope. Saxony, Bavaria Berlin. failed incentivice older population get AZ giving earlier vaccination appointments. receiving doses try get general population contrary PEI recommondation, might difficult. Additionally, fall behind vaccination regime second dose AZ longer Pfizer. lag behind twice next weeks.

Apart disorderly distribution, see people vaccinated unhealthy risk workplace like food retail on, result higher infection rates unnecessary really wish we'd fund global style New Zealand level response instead.

We know prevent infection.

We study treatments millions patients currently have. Leave camels alone. virus care borders.

I mean, except, like, kind does. US Canadian governments care borders currently limiting people able travel it.

Yes, complete lockdown, definitely going dramatically slow movement virus across border.  France Italy 400k day average, Germany 620k day. start seeing good results next weeks immunity builds amongst vulnerable. going affect vaccine, still develop immunity regardless whether infected.

Of course effects covid need considered, isn‚Äôt complete picture, it‚Äôs understandable younger people hesitant. hope you‚Äôre right!! ü§û Sure it‚Äôs undeniably better move open IP folks make vaccines. 

The reason open IP greed Also, approx 10% individuals get Covid-19 suffer long-term effects, often debilitating. That's incredibly high rate coronavirus. Dear India, Recomended sensible affordable sized families many decades ago. one reasons advise. many more, see fullness tome.  Sure take test, cant hurt. Awesome, thanks part stop covid. Yup feel really confident vaccinated fall. (eye roll) There's also huge mistrust medical establishment. complicated that. 100% confirmed reinfections (sequencing showing different infection rather remnants first), decent chunk worse second time, including deaths. Compared what? getting Covid 19 way way way way higher survival rate. Yes! Yesterday side effects knocked good hahaha I'm feeling great. Doesn‚Äôt say.

I got first dose day holiday, scheduled vacation day day second safe. jobs rent? people going worry losing pay, jobs, place living, livelihood? sadistic.

And yeah, would go India deports them. Obviously, important things worry about... someone gets deported, go? jail indefinitely Australia takes back? would horrific too. They're stuck no-mans land. article outdated. We've learned since March. Vaccines stop transmission cases. vaccines work well known variants far. 


We hit herd immunity sense goes away forever, sense cases plummet (already starting happen) pandemic end. isolated cases major issue. I‚Äôm surprised article didn‚Äôt get Rule 4‚Äôed sub. We're likely already point going minimal even almost nobody else gets vaccine largely going question fast goes though headlines always miss ratio patients changing, necessarily total number. CT, example, almost hospitalizations unvaccinated folks (likely 97-99%) which, given older population accepted vaccines, mostly younger folks. said total hospitalized tanking well 400 (was almost 2,000 peak last year).

So, summary, yes % old vs. young changing, overall picture pretty damn good. mean, what's next really question. get protects lives, what's next? Hazmat suits? Permant social distancing? live world risk can't keep dumbing lowest common denominator. protect every life cost living. crime show teeth smile one's love special occasion, socially dance wife mother without mask. Wife teacher. PRAISE LAWD reasoning immediately safe soon get vaccinated. takes several weeks build immunity want people going socialising large groups 5 mins jab.

You actually achieve best protection 2 weeks second jab 14 weeks first, even 100% effective.


They also want develop us society one rule vaccinated another rule still waiting. i've better part pandemic... know. i've discussions people good faith absolute wankers. i'll still give benefit doubt, use getting pissed reddit comments agree. shit things change pretty quickly lol Heck, I‚Äôm already vaccinated I‚Äôd love thousand bucks retroactively, would support even didn‚Äôt include me. need get shots arms! Cases deaths. yesterday today also 0 deaths well. We're also great job vaccinations, surprising given former news. Exciting read article it‚Äôs clickbait. don‚Äôt state sources say based submitted ‚Äúit day now.‚Äù Well, could tell that. younger 20 year old brother vaccine neutral lazy get it.

I'm paying $200 now...

I really want get lol. Strongly agree. I'm honest, I've arrived point care anymore. adults state eligible vaccinated month half now. somehow catch pass covid 95+% protection both, really consider problem point, vaccinated. I've dutifully protecting everyone past 14 months; I'm going spend another 6 months protecting themselves. 

I say though definitely see ""anxiety"" actual life. parents extremely hesitant rejoin world still prefer us wear masks we're visiting. sister go back work in-person 3 days week weeks now, constantly talks unsafe feels there. One friends still wears mask everywhere, gets curbside pickup exclusively, see anyone, etc. dreading day gets called back office. people fully immunized. Meanwhile I'm hitting gym every day hosting traveling friends apartment going restaurants shit. mean really, hell afraid point? I'm even risk-taker, I'm actually risk averse. risk fucking microscopic, get it. Get grip. This.... wife used work surgical/recovery always short staffed years pandemic.... feet entire shift, always late get shift hours sometimes, breaks patient ratio like 6:1 one coded they're cool replacing hips 90+ year old demented patients 1% survival rate anyway.... still paperwork/charting leave.  patient care level drops significantly, fatigue leads mistakes/med errors etc...... Cases, vaccines, both? too, couple weekends ago. Sushi! delicious! 


....and promptly got food poisoning.  


I still kinda want eat sushi though.... 'we' mean 'in US' might be. countries definitely tried, massively failed. possible isolate high risk groups - *will* infected others point.

Common sense? No, never was. Quarantine isolation/lockdown two different things. previous pandemics see infected quarantined, done pandemic. ""only isolating risk groups letting others free"" never common sense, never resulted anything avoidable deaths. still averaging 50,000 new infections day cases time last year went lockdown.

I don‚Äôt see we‚Äôre pretending like battle won. anything accepted defeat decided learn live it.  shelve forever point. J&amp;J seems easier use tbh, use young women. true, get Pfizer then? take Astra part risk demographic (young women) Pfizer risk free. went office today help welcome new employee (laptop setup such). work little time run around get food dinner, run errand, etc. stressful. can‚Äôt imagine day anymore without lunchtime walk market get dinner food enjoy sun. don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever go back 5 days week office. Why? Vaccines protective enough/reducing transmission enough individual? know many/who's vaccinated given space?  questions:

1. something currently studied?

2. example, immune system slow weak time gets going, mrna already degraded?

3. mrna ones (as-is) work, JNJ/AZ-type ones? directed there?

4. possible make mrna ones work? Like... bigger dose? Multiple doses right row? Something make mrna stable usual?  first round distribution includes 336 million doses AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine -- 240 million made Serum Institute India 96 million AstraZeneca -- well 1.2 million doses Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.

The majority COVAX doses AstraZeneca doses. struggling production issues - wouldn‚Äôt resolved forced IP licensing, yield quality problem. primary manufacturer trouble producing doses, starting scratch new, inexperienced location existing equipment infrastructure better?

Europe also impacted production issues - unique COVAX.

Notably, COVAX responding diversifying supply - today, 500 million dose deal struck Moderna, complementing existing deal Pfizer. Novavax comes online, also greatly improve supply situation.

I agree it‚Äôs frustrating COVAX met goals yet. IP licensing nothing situation - manufacturing capacity does. get jumped on, everyone it‚Äôs approved vaccinated house. (Ok normal vaccines well) approve vaccine young people quickly? experience recent vaccine HPV one (I think) took like 8 years fully accepted approved teens. I‚Äôm curious data make decision.  vaccines FDA approved, Emergency Use Authorization. FDA approval. headline disingenuous best. said, big bold letters, ""it nothing safety""

That lie.   tacitly agreeing reiterating - ""YES FUCKFACE THATS EXACTLY IM SAYING READ""  guess. Kind weird joke though talking life shortening disease specifically affects children. think reasonable think person straightforward.  still raging large parts US. articles act like we're totally past COVID instead finally getting ahead little bit. Yes. give to? people already fully vaccinated? I'm eager return normal, anxious neither city state really so.  NJ governor incentivizing vaccine free beer. know would best incentive get vaccine?? Get vaccine don‚Äôt wear mask. pretend vaccinated, cares? They‚Äôre ones risk people vaccinated. What‚Äôs big deal though? people saw getting pissed seemed pissed restrictions vaccinated people lifted quickly. seem want know, ""what's point even getting vaccine nOtHiNg cHaNgEs??""

I seen anyone pissed CDC think vaccinated people keep wearing masks outdoors. idea parts US still distance learning. We're classroom Ireland without vaccines. Covid made realize incredibly selfish vast majority people are

Yeah, kind person that's going restaurants last year certainly going stay home they've got cold flu whatever know what, I'd rather catch stuff either. lot people? No, think find quite annoying, actually keep hearing supply issues constraining vaccine creation...and also patents? Can't both.  Well, one‚Äôs forcing you. feel absolute end spectrum - I‚Äôm 26 could care less getting COVID. ultimate irony came whole family got serious lockdown except me. life simply bigger worries disease likely different typical flu (young healthy immune system). got vaccinated courtesy open already. It‚Äôs never going fully go away, hell, still tuberculosis active huge chunk word‚Äôs population, yet people go everyday unconcerned. guess IQ single digit going try explain slooowly.

Vaccinated person Sars-Cov can't use person host immunity Person get phase transmission possible. children point. vaccinated I'll feel comfortable going back whatever normal now. press starts tracking patients died VITT caused vaccinations, could lead seious backlash Danish politicians within Danish politics. better worse politicians cannot assume deaths same.

The EMA estimates 1 2 blood clot cases per 100000 vaccinations. use Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccinate 100000 people per week one potential nation wide newspaper headline per week. think real reason stopped using Johnson Johnson Denmark. I‚Äôm saying you‚Äôre making assumptions continued testing means far EUA means less safe full approval. One premier vaccine scientists said there‚Äôs difference comes safety. Agreed  Time pray virus away! Praise Jebus! One folks group friends showing extreme anxiety going back normal. He's freaking going even stores since things started opening (in CA)...when he's going without worry April even plenty gatherings (with sufficient precautions).

I'm sure places going back full time, I'm seeing less circle. simple IP transfers help that?

5K genetic code doesn‚Äôt save people pandemic, doses finished vaccines do. Producing doses affordable prices using existing infrastructure much better investment world.

We totally invest production capacity worldwide, especially believe boosters may necessary, course. IP licensing demonstrably constraint - every viable vaccine factory pretty much struck partnership one successful vaccine designs already, GAVI/COVAX great logistics funding plan place get doses lower income nations. can't make single type vaccine works everybody regardless age, sex, race, etc.?

I think that's going happen Disney World's region country. correct saying variants affect vaccinated.

I'm psychiatrist, can't make determination one way friend, describing symptoms [COVID-19 anxiety Everyone else house fully vaccinated. vaccinated helps protect her, vaccinated helps protect me. 

She less likely bring home COVID (either symptomatic asymptomatic) vaccinated.

Think mini-herd immunity. also 90lb adult women. enforced page full exceptions .gov page.

Like, shit, states trying make legal discriminate LGBT folks they're like ""No discriminating people trying spread disease."" indoor setting maskless people dangerous infection. even discussion, indeed car drive maskless people. obviously vaccinated risk drops, well that's vaccines do.   know people Sweden wrong.

I‚Äôm immunosuppressed therefore, vaccine fully work me. eager start living life things like indoor dining. Even though *actually* huge risk me. Also hope mental health awareness becomes thing.

WFH definitely needs stick. gives us energy see friends family things fully opened. interest going back old life everyone busy basically hanged friends month, fuck shit. handle though? several Scandinavian countries basically said oh well...at least paying anymore people died droves public care systems. homes profit driven get uncaring facilities looking make buck cost publicly run get cost saving measures weigh old lives much less important younger ones. friend comfortable, friend force him.

Pills come different shapes mass divided pill cutters well even pill crushers customize dosage.

In certain cases make custom dosed capsules powdered medication.

Some medications liquid form too. Something interesting US vaccination rate consistently decreasing several weeks now, 3.4m per day average April 13th 2.5m average today. less numbers peak at, maintaining high rates, doubt US struggling supply...  thing 32 moment eligible vaccine went got 4 weeks 25-39 year olds. Nothing elderly risk groups. 1-2 weeks everybody else.


In Denmark cases, hospitalisations deaths stable low level three months, risks groups almost fully vaccinated day 5-10% population tested. risks Covid therefore lower risks associated AZ J&amp;J vaccines. 

The Netherlands less fortunate situation therefore it‚Äôs easy decision use vaccines. mentioned AZ specifically it‚Äôs approved US doesn‚Äôt seem like soon, yeah. know doses stockpiles completely finished, may well get good it‚Äôs going administered US.   Essentially, ""low risk"" people restrictions time last year, despite improvements treatments vaccination program full course.

If ""safe enough"" roam around last June, certainly June. wonder uptick towards fall universities require vaccine.  said somewhere else, AB-InBev major brewer ought team Walgreens, CVS, etc. offer free 12 pack first dose.

Literally FDA exactly that. it‚Äôs not, need vaccinate entire globe....... RNA treatments work? Nanolipids + mRNA well: makes different vaccine (except encode protein, used vaccinate people)? put fly lists endangering others. Failure monitor even spotting one-in-million effects like blood clotting pretty much separate issue don‚Äôt think worry mRNA vaccines.  contribute solution. believe person island.

Also, random numbers. Covidactnow risk levels roughly line I've seen Harvard Brown School Public Health. NJ moved orange yesterday.  may 100% sure last time heard it, said reduce mortality, however reduce time patient must hospitalized. believe Trump got Remdesivir well hmm... yes, see. proposing immediately toss sociological studies completed 6-12 months ago (checks notes) ""has questionable relevance today."" estimate: summer, everyone wants one get it.  I'm mate. seems way extra pushing hard vaccinate kids. High risk people sure. extent hard push vaccinate.

I think people also forget natural immunity. fact low chance lot people even get covid. Especially kids.

Worst case scenarios anecdotes taken grain salt. likely contract COVID unvaccinated, *not* correct. outcomes better mine get it, could either give one us classmate. 

The whole point stop/limit transmission, also increase chances surviving contract COVID. know plenty long-term issues COVID-19 cause. Children low risk death, there's whole lot outcomes ""drops dead right away"" ""completely, totally fine"". pandemic around 2024 poor countries wrong protective ever be. spread virus likely lower later on, gives protection. districts near teachers person still ‚Äúzoom room‚Äù many parents chosen keep kids home. teacher teaching person kids kids home time. son‚Äôs high school less 35% kids person Freshmen. Sadly till mid may, second dose timeline kicks in,so numbers first doses reduced brutally enough vaccine second shots. India vaccine (Covaxin) lisenced produce AstraZeneca (Covishield)

The problem right shortage raw materials removing IP rights wont change surprising. India Nepal open border since 1950. Almost said false. Nobody grasp statistics would say breakthrough cases constitute decent amount, breakthrough cases result severe sickness death, point vaccines are. none variants resistant vaccines; may reduced efficacy, resistance slowing number people showing up. Israel can‚Äôt really get 60%, vaccine passports lot activities. 

I want positive fellow Americans letting down. could testing stations airports.... specific blood cloths like mention, way deadly. Lucky incidence rate relatively low post locked repeated rule-breaking comments. Please take time review [sub fully vaccinated means lowered risk substantial amount. That's debatable. 

I agree. That's debatable. 

However, indoor dining raises risk substantial amount, magnitude depending numerous factors (the level community spread area, specifics restaurant, etc). risk still might low worry about, people might want wait factors like community spread get better. mean covax program he‚Äôs advocating donations. It‚Äôs massive failure even compared way little goals originally. Covax scheme expected distribute least 100 million doses worldwide end March, 38 million jabs delivered far.

I've also seen FDA approved Emergency Use hospitalized patients.  

I've searching google there's conflicting info. 
- remdesivir improve mortality rate?  
- worth someone hospitalized receive treatment? Depends Europe. France huge anti-vaxx movement well, Nordics, Netherlands Germany better vaccination rates... also anti-vaxxers and/or uneducated people don‚Äôt understand risks. 25-39 year old, others done July (fingers crossed) anyone educate here, JJ vaccine dangerous what? little googling found stuff halted due weird side effects. 

Any reading topic would appreciated! time, characterized ""sneezing sniffling place"" might something could get over, especially something like pollen that'd affect months. little bit meds could go long way there. probably USA, since we're randomly testing? cases still mean 'with enough symptoms doctor recommended test', right ?

Even vaccines \*change\* ratio deaths cases (and preliminary data have, don't), cases still mean hospitalizations deaths. thought would like I've comfortable hanging around vaccinated people going activities like sports games mean far Lateral flow tests high enough accuracy rate used instead PCRs fact many times permitted travel.

Why testing airport part boarding process silly. Congrats! felt like naughty without mask, first time shots. margarita cured concerns great date night.  Moderna behind getting approved age group? Throwing away? double mutant India strain anti-vaxxers, we're still long way this. majority scientists think never might reach herd immunity, alarming serves warning need keep we've past year-plus. Here's thing: vaccinated go out, want wear mask times, think that's perfectly fine! past year weird ride everybody, natural different people different risk tolerances people uneasy ease back normal others.

I ask judge us want recapture sense normalcy. Personally, can't wait start moving back regular routine Hahaha say see it. rules everything, mean we'll follow we'll certainly give big tut anybody like breaks them, whilst breaking ourselves. think schedule like pretty reasonable hope that's happens places. reality things easily done person others matter, time office time flexible makes sense me. FYI‚Äî took part trial program monoclonal antibodies specific intent direct treatment people weak immune systems. Hopefully lead proper ways Dad get immunity future link pharma person merely linking things talking complex manufacturing is. Hell, even manufacturing, actual processes. first points aren‚Äôt even relevant all. hell talking failed trials vaccines all? We‚Äôre talking manufacturing moderna biontechs vaccines, something already gone trial process. 

The idea stuff hard couldn‚Äôt done nonsense. difficult way means can‚Äôt done. Simply discussing process manufacturing, discussing process regulatory requirements, items needed GxP, way informed ‚Äúrebuttal‚Äù reasoning one else manufacture vaccines. none people ever heard biosimilars before? Massively complex manufacturing needed this, mention massive grey zone regulatory aspects due manufactured living cell lines host manufacturer even changing product time! vaccine free availability wide open point. think people accessibility issues like person voting (time off, reliable transport)? Fair park least commodating DART, shuttle bring people train station. Maybe cross lack communication accessibility get vaccine? think people waiting cases drop negligible.  Right, healthy children need vaccine could put grandparents danger (much reduced eliminated) transmission help incubate variants. 

In addition, least one recent variant seems strongly affecting children symptomatically. Data year ago questionable relevance today.  outdoor stadiums 33% capacity large indoor events 100%? make sense. guess worded bad, total cases Houston. Per capita bad there's lot people still, county, lot cases. weeks ago county judge literally begging Twitter people come get vaccine day. get hit like RGV still lot people lot risk given populated county is, that's I'm surprised *state average* vaccinations. would normally dismiss scale problem, empty lines vaccine, conservative, conservative outlying counties highest vaccination rates state. We'll see. still think going decline quite bit even Florida. Keep mind Florida really heavily one county Miami-Dade. rest state actually badly affected deadlier per day per capita? Idk country extremely low vaccination rate locals heavily Olympics.

Governments never act best interest people.  government able mandate masks long need. goes public health measure vaccine. fiance nhs admin staff mate worked Saturday. also told right fair enough mate haha. Weekends often voluntary prior bank holiday long weekend. Makes sense haha

It great news. January/Feb almost feels surreal.  do. vaccine that's authorized 12-15 year-olds adult vaccine. tested authorized separately.  terms cases/deaths per capita throughout whole pandemic Oregon Washington bottom. probably lack natural immunity scale California since didn‚Äôt spread much.

Cases may spike I'm hoping risk people already vaccinated translate hospitalization/deaths surge.  Except vaccinations, cases deaths become uncoupled  get ""I can't get vaccinated let anyway"" passport? misleading define something incorrect definition. I'm saying safe. I'm reiterating EUA relate safety phase 3 clinical trials completed potential (possibly unknown) threats outweighs potential/realized benefits long anti-vaxxers still walk among us threat, hence continued utility masks. Plus, double mutant India strain doorstep. think it‚Äôs vaccines aren‚Äôt dependent body mass like medications are. vaccine needs trigger immune response medications absorbed tissues. mass have, tissue have. immune system isn‚Äôt dependent mass. You‚Äôll never bulletproof vaccine that‚Äôs close get. get vaccine otherwise? hope numbers fall whatever random rate want? Hence likely outcome anyone slated deportation gets sit Indian prison longer. regular travel currently required 14 day stopover elsewhere India really wanted someone gone quickly would best bet.  We'll get 50% nation probably opened 12-15 year olds later week next week, even it'll probably slow trickle.

The groups need convinced strategized around opinion are:

* Younger populations (we're stalling ~40% &lt;30 year olds getting shot nationwide).

* Southern states (Florida high-water mark right south 42% vaccinated, five states south 35% less - Georgia, Tennessee, Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi). think confluence factors areas, *just* political, need think barriers adoption. interesting see Europe takes Covid19 vaccine readily actually reach herd immunity. much better Europe rollout, fear anti-vax contingent may stronger Europe's. suspicion concerned, go anyway business standpoint gain business requiring passport worried would come passport.  post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Anyone truly concerned ramifications loosening covid restrictions really focus getting vaccinated asap. San Francisco's health department said expect start vaccinating 5-12 year olds early summer.

So might 6-8 weeks away. Guys, I‚Äôm 90% certain person using cat/dog/horse example support person replied to‚Äôs assertion mass isn‚Äôt import vaccines medications. Horses fuckload bigger cats dogs, vaccine approved above, seemingly dosage. think make great points agree with. Place burden population sacrifice IP, largely publicly funded. Life saving knowledge technology can't given away would take away profits pharmaceutical corporations. Twisted shit. US, choice moderna, pfizer, J&amp;J. moderna pfizer objectively better, even get single shot. mistake Based Michigan, I'd say cases increasing some, spiking ;) It‚Äôs great feeling, congrats üòÅ view whether states supply constrained demand constrained. Based current run rate doses administered (7-day moving average state) available supply (doses delivered minus doses administered), calculate ""days supply"" proxy likely constraint. 

If 21 days supply, assume state demand constrained: state probably able effectively use doses. 

If 14 21 days supply, unclear whether state either demand constrained supply constrained (or bad logistics). 

if less 14 days supply, assume state supply constrained - doses, could probably get shots arms. 

No states become supply constrained already supply constrained since last Sunday. 

6 states became demand constrained (noted asterisk below): North Dakota, Illinois, California, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Deleware. 

4 states moved ""supply constrained"" ""unclear"": Colorado, New Jersey, Hawaii (note due data dump last week - return normalcy Hawaii), Maine. 

No states moved ""Unclear"" ""Supply Constrained"". Currently, Massachusetts, Wisconsin, Minnesota meet criteria considered supply constrained. 

Based trends data, likely last week state supply constrained (at least current definition). pretty significant milestone. access may remain issue vulnerable populations, true state anyone wants vaccine get one relative ease.

Every virus situation unique. Measles contagious requires well 90% people vaccinated provide herd immunity. don‚Äôt know percentage covid. Please stop spreading misinformation.  think necessarily true. Scare tactics tend work people already following rules.  I'm super excited people keep wearing masks protecting me.

For myself, fuck masks. Vaccines at. I've never gotten flu vaccine before, sure start. vaccine advancements we've last year make wonder could eliminate flu next years. metro area? Major city? honestly never thought angle. 

It easy anti-vax crowds pretend caring cautious.

Thus creating feeling bother.

Very interesting. lot us waiting kids able vaccinated. kids vaccinated, we‚Äôre going anywhere. Except enormous chunk population (children 16) cannot get vaccine. Yes, children resistant virus, still risk long circulating population.   agree China strict. change sooner later gotta ride storm hope nothing crazy come India.... place sounds like madness Yeah, liked Biden Trump it‚Äôs annoying seeing media treat kid‚Äôs gloves. stock pile send? ventilators dad needed one. died weeks ago complications pnuemonia. needed ventilator none available used incoming covid patients Toronto.  term pandemic means spreading across multiple countries. 2 months it'll still pandemic. theory, yes. practice, no. 

First, exponential decline gets really slow long end curve. takes much longer go 100 1 go 100K 1000. 

More importantly, Rt also statistical figure relies bit central limit theorem meaning. cases drop low, Rt dominated local effects - cities, neighborhoods, even households vaccination rate immunity. nationwide herd immunity inherently mean local herd immunity. takes long time end diseases endemically. Measles took 30 years example (of course, measles MUCH contagious COVID). 

Regardless, people vaccinated - importantly, people vaccinated EVERYWHERE, faster disease eradicated. 

As extreme example (and ignoring children second) tie vaccination $5000 stimulus check (payable cash time vaccination) we'd last COVID case end year. lot counties Tennessee stuck around 50% 60% 65 people vaccinated could another wave deaths outbreak. It‚Äôs crazy don‚Äôt want get vaccines. Bangladesh imposed strict nationwide lockdown several weeks, seems ben effective reversing case  People struck meteors, yes. many. I‚Äôm helping India saying general we‚Äôre even halfway vaccinated country. act still doesn‚Äôt potential break out. Yes. Kind insane it‚Äôs like one way other. HK desperate ml tourists. 
Both ways quarantine free travel vaccinated people travel none vaccinated. would lot better yet antivaxxer movement keeps growing. Lack education lack exposure alternate (and correct) information blame. well everyone living echo chamber bad information. **MASSACHUSETTS UPDATE**

Using date 95% adults dose 1, get second dose 31 days later (1 month Moderna), plus additional 14 days immunity kick in, put us date of: Sunday, July 18th (- 15 days), 95% adults fully vaccinated.

Notes: 

* Pfizer EUA expanded age 12, eligible population updated accordingly.

**I need feedback:**

I manual calculation number residents 16 2020. Using formula (2019 adults * (2020 pop / 2019 pop ) + 2019 pop * (% children * (1/9))

I obtained number 5,801,293 residents 16 2020. 4.7% deviation number 18+ adults 2019. Combined 2% increase population 2020 (7,029,917) compared 2019. I'm considering changing total adult population numbers use 2020 estimates 16+ estimate. However, mean % values longer match CDC, still uses 2019 values. Thoughts changing values new ones?   Wow entire south absolutely killing numbers....

Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Arkansas low 30%'s still.

Credit due, Florida seems okish job mirroring national average. 

This embarrassing. Herd immunity going arrive different times various regions US. Parts Vermont New Hampshire probably getting already. 

Sadly, rural areas South may never get there. Specifically places everyone smokes doesn‚Äôt get flu vaccine. going get vaccinated large enough numbers summer, maybe ever. social media cracked long ago. can't open facebook read news article without dumbass posting antivax nonsense--never gets taken down.

Kind disappointing day yesterdays numbers. Hopefully coming week J&amp;J boost keep us 1m Ah ok, language used, steps process  title post misleading approved. health authorities stated done looked practice. going political decision whether actually it. Exactly, projection opinion designed drive clicks.  us kids 16 can't get vaccinated yet. 

I really understand people say like anyone cares. made choice children, one made you. Part kids making sacrifices them. see post like every single day acting like fact children acceptable imposition me. whole article projection conjecture based vaccine hesitancy polls. science here, thought experiment designed drive clicks stoke reader fear. 

I play game well. **believe** certain areas country reach level herd immunity (like New England) see numbers plummet, areas country still seeing high case counts hospitalizations make bigger push incentivize people get vaccinated. 

Vaccine passports absolutely start thing, especially airlines, hesitant start finding extreme pressure get vaccinated. 

That's **my** projection based data available general understanding human behavior, useful writer tried here. Pfizer approved ages 12-15 US week anybody love risk severe health effects death COVID? also offering altar convenience?  I‚Äôm happy child!! Fuck article. Disingenuous, fear baiting bullshit. turns true... People hate hotel quarantine (it's expensive many, short really account 4-7 day incubation), turns true, whole fragile system they've got collapse. 

I follow topic closely, recall ever reading outbreaks countries' quarantine hotels. (Such Taiwan, example.) feel bad travelers everything right got infected country...  Everyone age everyone within age groups currently targeted? People view site multiple times different devices. cell phones, cell tower would count different IP.  I'm Primary School Teacher Scotland... earn 36k year, fact BF earn finishes training ridiculously low fact training takes much longer responsibilities insurmountably higher vaccinated? So, protected. get coronvirus, severity infection reduced.  Glad guys well, hope stays way! Thank saying this! can't get it. people think kids immune stress dealing freaking global pandemic??? Let's please treat like human beings. heartbreaking. Nepal probably incapable dealing COVID. meantime, sounds unfair what's alternative? Keeping boomers home well?

Or wait (allegedly) another month change risk individuals get vaccinated loosen restrictions everyone, since remaining people low risk. Boomers hang month half; hung year them. 

I'm gonna absolute bare minimum get fined. I'm excited go grocery store everyday pick like two things going four different Kleinanzeigen pickups week. literally told ‚Äúinvestigational drug trial‚Äù. read paper. looked stored vaccine related stuff (like card). want I‚Äôm happy upload picture too.

The drug trials ended December mRNA vaccines either February January J&amp;J. get emergency use authorization, need pass Phase I, Phase II Phase III safety trials. That‚Äôs **minimum** requirement. they‚Äôre looking efficacy data, site inspections, etc. Mostly bureaucratic steps.

The ‚Äúnot able sue‚Äù related government deciding take liability claims order remove measure risk vaccine manufacturers due diligence, reduce cost per vaccine. negative effect, government pays it. negligence **should** handled due diligence, still sue manufacturers.

There billion doses given almost issues though, would seen far problem vaccines though, essentially moot point.

You worried something seriously need be.  seem right. salon day stylist 20 years old. sneezing sniffling place. like ""oh worry, covid! really bad allergies!"" really care wearing mask I'm fully vaccinated, responded ""Oh, take anything allergies?"" (thinking could bond medications suffer bad allergies too!) said ""I try to."" like... oh. okay. would yourself? okay. manufactured elsewhere, including India. facilities set manufacturers assistance. need hands takes time. incentive make many doses fast can.

What don‚Äôt want do, reasonable, release ‚Äòplans‚Äô let everyone without assistance oversight.

Edit: don‚Äôt know random YouTube channel, here‚Äôs agree current imperative scale existing vaccines quickly possible maintaining strict safety quality standards. premise debate true, would need additional manufacturers could would stand ready manufacture additional vaccines thwarted IP restrictions. see evidence currently case‚Äîand, contrary, believe taking antagonistic posture toward IP may actually slow compromise production. I'm getting first shot AstraZeneca vaccine Sunday (9 May), wanted get help know going vaccination. I'm aware yahoo around small risks, still, feel like know much should. mean I'm completely uninformed, feel know enough look monitor post-vaccination unlikely situation something come up.

I know gist it, information cluttered confusing. One minute 4 million risk, 6 4 million risk, 9.3 million risk. definitive breakdown everything anyone choosing get AZ vaccine know?

But end, 27 y/o, male, active fairly healthy overall existing health conditions, likely good still definitely slight paranoia back mind. anyone vaccinated AZ vaccine useful info know too, please help ya boy out.

Some questions start...

1. Despite TTS/blood clotting rare, symptoms monitor post-vaccination safe?
2. Anything first dose?
3. definitive risk ratio AZ vaccinations result blood clot cases?
4. younger end people getting AZ vaccine, anything else cautious particularly look older person need to?

Any info would super helpful. Thanks, everyone!  makes think would risen? Yeah, mean big joke nobody enforcing this, like all. policies dumb toothless eroding credibility. think depends situation. culture multigenerational households norm, I've got two (separate) cousins living parents; one sees long-term situation wife take care parents age, he's main financial contributor, etc. permanent student taking credits there, providing income, mother cooks makes bed, expected he'll hang going parents' retirement funds unless they're fortunate enough get good marriage find younger woman take mother's hands, increasingly unlikely deeper 40s gets. One sad, traditional gender role expectations seems what's working best them. case trending towards over-burdened, back potentially close more.

I think one reasons governors states moving slowly genie bottle (restrictions lifted) going tough lot places get back people unwilling resume restricted life.  hear swore Novavax hates EU refused contract

They still signed. article hopeful EU functionary claiming sign winter. ‚Äúin countries approved‚Äù referring US. Safety established authorize emergency use. vaccine medicine needed address emergency situation coronavirus pandemic, **once shown safe** effective, FDA grant emergency use authorization, EUA. EUA allows vaccine, treatment medication used formal FDA approval. chances vaccine effective variant extremely small.

And case, news would come extremely fast. would know quickly new risk.

The chances getting sick variant vaccine effective news came warn astronomically small it‚Äôs worth worrying about. 

If worried terrified car accidents, lightning strikes, etc. much likely kill you.  aren‚Äôt relaying US. watched video, aware anything going on, you‚Äôd know US blocking raw materials going India, even IP lifted, effort manufacture vaccines inhibited. 

They also idle manufacturing facilities around world waiting IP lifted. companies moderna Pfizer rejected cooperation plan fall. imagine situation around world today millions vaccines manufactured? i'm skeptical messaging public health officials like Dr. Gandhi using: vaccines open opportunities live best life, go ahead &amp; start re-socializing &amp; broadcast world. get want anti-vax crowd think they're missing something, reality cohort back normal since mask mandates lifted. expect full FDA approval? Memorial Day always target. beach towns already lost one summer, way hell lose another  long plague walkers refuse get vaccinated herd immunity.  Plus ones hesitant getting informed college campus require come back. That's entirely dependent live. expect last least end year Chicago, longer. OK. delay hit 19 - 35 yr olds. date pushed 4 weeks. merely matter getting vaccine free move about, matter Health. 
It no-brainer AZ decision last month. 
There talk letting people getting AZ want, easy sounds, convince GP give go ahead. Yeah, position restrictions. great uptick numbers since reduced restrictions concern waiting little longer reduce data driven. What‚Äôs good cutoff number? vaguely remember seeing 50 per 100k somewhere  it‚Äôs beneficial EU sign something doesn‚Äôt guarantee deliveries.

If 3,000 people dying day EU currently does, better get *some* doses best efforts basis, nothing company can't give cast iron guarantees?

It seems EU would rather guarantee price thousands EU people continuing die every day, rather lower death rate best efforts might embarass EU functionary. Vaccines medications work completely differently. long term plan Illinois. full lifting capacity distancing restrictions, masks required CDC says otherwise. would carefully watch cases per 100,000 area. Test positivity rates may increase vaccinations increase fewer people getting tested.   Yea would healthier would letting people die good reason. sick. Skepticism implies logic. Thinking know better people spend whole lives studying something logical. Going scientific method logical, antithesis skepticism. 

Don't confuse skepticism paranoia. question. get may reported judging votes that‚Äôs what‚Äôs happened. asked good faith. got good answers. everybody get confirmation biases.  long younger children vaccinated, hopefully. makes say that? fan J&amp;J vaccine reason? enforced slightest. sort restrictions worked tandem vaccine effort get us point. cost aspect, yes probably countries getting shafted contracts made. countries capacity make vaccines themselves. 

Is IP limiting factor? Yes, something proven be. Despite gates lobbying groups ate saying. mention, Covax work around allows IP remain place way bandwidth first place. it‚Äôs failure meeting even shit numbers begin with. Covax scheme expected distribute least 100 million doses worldwide end March, 38 million doses delivered far. I've thinking lately, interested thoughts.

The number focused deciding next steps hospitalizations. cases, deaths, vaccination rates. know cases indicator hospitalizations, deaths, vaccination rates future indicator cases, go next months, I'm reminded strategy time last year.

We focused flattening curve, hospitals overwhelmed. Babies, heart attacks, car accidents care else going on, need make sure bed ICU available need including covid patients.

If hospitals over-burdened, open little more. still over-burdened, even more. case trending towards over-burdened, back potentially close more.

As continue 2021, cases rest year, may longer translate hospitalizations deaths like before.

People continue get vaccinated, move slower, impact felt less less. point soon, extra 75k vaccinated state may make meaningful impact.

Hospitalizations matters most. I‚Äôm boat. Fully vaccinated high risk I‚Äôm pretty ready return normal least around others vaccinated. 

I‚Äôm fine people taking precautions I‚Äôm tired don‚Äôt want shamed decisions. approved US. safety efficacy established here. EUA sign informed consent agreement. signing informed consent agreement, become participant investigational drug trial, event something goes wrong, can't sue anybody. FDA approval, FDA pharmaceutical company liable damages. I‚Äôd say big whale regard masks. Say vaccinated people don‚Äôt need wear them, indoors out. certainly afford it, even non-vaccinated people take advantage, plus good chunk consumer spending happens restaurants, diners don‚Äôt wear masks anyway  Body aches, inflammation, pain touch common.

For personally, back ached tremendously 24 hrs. thought kidneys would explode something.
I would say wait, there's much really besides ibuprofen acetaminophen, usually aches go away 24-48hrs.

*Not medical professional, medical advice. dad needs medical help, pls take hospital Reddit thread* NYS already passport app, wonder simple bouncer type checking that?  deserves capital punishment vaccine saving lives. No. According Danish health authorities risk AZ vaccine cannot linked one particular gender age group.    Basically there‚Äôs hard cap. limit capacity long distancing still place. doesn‚Äôt help places relaxing restrictions far early resulting massive surges overwhelmed hospitals.  Yeah really becomes height irony want walk restaurant mask on, look around see 100 people wearing mask standing room. Example: take antidepressants. Daily. side effects severe bruxism. Years later, I'm still dealing bruxism. 

I've also vaccines. vaccines. recently Covid vaccine. I've literally issues days after. Never long term. Bc body long enough trigger immune response build antibodies catch virus, body fight it. thought already got rid restrictions long time ago haha. sure left aside word ""Covid-19"" vocabulary lol.

Doesn't state continued vaccine rationing Canada mean anything him? dazzled Feds' ""vaccine portfolio"" conflating obscene amount *pre-ordered* doses current inventory deliveries date?

Our inventory still insufficient **six months** mass vaccination drive. account facts that:

i) We're *still* using untested 16-week spread administering two-dose vaccines. even EU UK darkest days inventory shortages going limb like this. Unlike there, Canadians half-vaccinated firm booking second appointment. do, also know second dose booked 16 weeks later rebooked earlier date whenever authorities deem truly sufficient supply justify rebooking.

People US like Bill Gates also explicitly worked prevent global cooperation vaccines. Oxford going make vaccine free manufacture Gates swooped in. He's likewise used obscene wealth set parallel infrastructure prevent IP waivers sharing agreements.

All national obligation talk false dilemma. could millions upon millions vaccinated point people like Gates going way get people killed protect pharma Many many immunological diseases seem triggered viral/bacterial infections. asthma multiple sclerosis even alzheimer's disease. idea downvoted right supposed enforced actuallity isnt Plus many eligible date would put second shot planning return home would return campus second, waiting till go home even get first. Must Bill Gates personally silencing you. risk what? spread it, would issue everyone else vaccinated? people don‚Äôt accept they‚Äôre wrong something, kudos correcting yourself! Astra Zaneca blood clots. Far lesser covid complications look people age 30+. younger people, even covid death 1 million chance. fatal blood clots becomes significant concern

I think main issue. vaccine comlications outnumber covid complications (which case ages 10-15), makes sense vaccinate. 

Eg UK offering alternatives Astra Zaneca Jab due blood : anti vaxxer. Get vaccine people. bringing challenges younger people helps put things perspective, lookup COVID positivity rate state county, figure neighbor likely infected, most, 0.1% chance infecting outdoors even (likely much lower, 0, given distance) Right? also idea. So, bashing EU (surely, right reasons...), interesting stuff background fix issues hand, almost immediate effect. Reading kind helped restore lost faith had. someone tries follow covid developments across Europe, first time read role.

Also, read [this article fully vaccinated, Pfizer (woohoo !!). definitely stuff before, probably keep behavior changes achieve magical herd immunity, even :). feel particular pressure anybody, risk averse, still risk.

I probably use mask inside store (it bother me), probably keep outside activities instead inside. second dose Thursday.. first 48 hours worst bad body aches. Since issues fatigue headache off. know covid generally isnt issue children right? live Chile. 90% vaccinations done Sinovac (the 10% belongs Pfizer). two weeks ago, efficacy reports vaccine came - it‚Äôs 80% effective preventing deaths. entire family (including myself) fully vaccinated want meet friend also fully vaccinated, yet can‚Äôt help feel really unsure entire situation. know won‚Äôt die become severely ill get COVID, parents old I‚Äôm afraid could part 20%.   say that's necessarily true. here's study correlation obesity human immune response example suggests relationship People/businesses may operate full capacity Sunday/day bank holiday show us violation is, sounds like regurgitating talking Health Insurance Portability Accountability Act 1996 (HIPAA) federal law required creation national standards protect sensitive patient health information disclosed **without patient‚Äôs consent knowledge.**

You consenting show vaccination card. fair dont know long term issues vaccine could possibly cause right? Canceling sends message think, things like happen fall.

If commented event things go sideways (which possible) hook lot money. easier punt work 2022 less risk. dont know hipaa 4 hours since wrote this, least 100K people vaccinated. moderator removed person's response could see it. remember gist was? I'm assuming based comment, throwing back something, support claim?

EDIT: kind wish post stayed up, claims like deserve challenged. Going person's history (which noted last night post removed), strongly anti-mask, too. isn't. absolutely nothing HIPAA prevents anyone asking medical status. HIPAA says medical provider can't disclose information without consent. 

The ADA *does* protections can/can't asked- would think folks spouting talking point would least picked appropriate law misinterpret. Hmm, maybe repeat enough it'll become true? thought process here? florida gonna florida... could helpful try use data calculate probabilities feeling overwhelmed/afraid. I've mom fully vaccinated still afraid normal activities. sit calculate, okay, chance covid-positive person movie theater? chance transmission fully vaccinated person? chance vaccinated person develops symptoms? chance person's symptoms really bad? chances die? multiply odds together say, like, go movies I'll 0.00027% dying covid, that's pretty low risk, think want go movies. (I made number thin air get picture.)

You also odds gut telling look statistics double-check gut. So, smelling cigarette smoke thinking ""oh god there's definitely covid air, bet 50-50 odds sick already"" math say ""Okay, gut overestimating risk. There's actually 0.0005% chance I've gotten covid breathing somebody's second-hand smoke."" Lol right lot great brewers list. None less I‚Äôm happy they‚Äôre motivate even one person get vaccinated. 5 deaths total would occur (assuming change due knowledge side effects), current number. Less 1 million people die. 5 less 28.

Today basically cuttoff making decision nothing, physically, done yet prepare. I'm sure lots office work gone preperation far. However, May Oktoberfest beers must begin brewing June construciton tents must start (which requires decent amount laborers vaccinated). mention hiring temporary labor staffs stalls tents. would expensive stuff begin later cancell. Sounds interesting. I'd love see real data it. hard time believing difference older elderly younger elderly / right versus left significant statistically terms voting results, Covid fatalities larger group means overall group gets stronger right-leaning, could based bias older people know. I'd interested looking real numbers. Seems like recent history looking 65+ whole instead splitting smaller groups, voting habits pretty predictable pretty significantly red. Oh mean ""Health Insurance Portability Accountability Act"" keep private business accountable? Hopefully states delay rollout help us older risk chance get vaccine becomes even harder kids start getting it. see you‚Äôre simply ignoring decades work occurred BioNTech Moderna funded investors refine core mRNA concept viable vaccine platform.  don‚Äôt understand, everyone coming establishment vaccinated, would worried someone else isn‚Äôt?

CDC usually conservative organization still plenty people angry repealing outdoor mask mandate despite really much scientific basis many months. People going confronting anxieties rapidly next month, month half likely restrictions go wayside. right, currently still reason many people hold anxieties practice precaution; though important start recognizing valid trained due year fear.

What risks vaccinated?

Are events gave anxiety actually safe do?

Should reconsider idea ""needing' versus ""wanting"" something activities desire longer pose societal risk?

Doing everything stop pandemic asked noble, soon world normal, Covid may still circulating low levels, people need address thinking risk assessments may risk true anxiety disorders agoraphobia. things discussions restrictions begin roll back healthy.

Edit: world mean US/western world really, let bias show there. rest world much longer go  Yeah also wondered logic behind kind action.

Then saw antivaxx ""news"" claiming Pfizer vaccine somehow transmissible vaccinated unvaccinated.... yeah understand believe start acting like this.... ""FDA expects EUA submission include safety data accumulated phase 1 2 studies conducted vaccine, expectation phase 3 data include median follow-up least 2-months (meaning least half vaccine recipients phase 3 clinical trials least 2 months follow-up) completion full vaccination regimen""

So something safety mild asymptomatic reinfections. complicated rocket science. far appears one lucky ones severe long-term symptoms

This practically misinformation. said ""so far appears among overwhelming majority didnt severe long-term symptoms.""

The media done great job distorting people's ideas covid. huge number Americans polled recently said believe hospitalization rate covid *fifty percent.* chance end summer India takes US badly affected country pure numbers wise? Meaning per capita. It‚Äôs one sided too. People SoCal don‚Äôt give fuck Bay Area Bay fumes every possible thing. Exactly. think restrictions pretty much important vaccinations, get us here.

However looking vaccines production, seems likely doses 2022 needed except boosters.

Shipments delayed multiple weeks, quantities slashed half, complete mess. talking hasty generalization Japan Olympics might happen two months, Oktoberfest fine. Things may fine Germany September Oktoberfest traditionally held, suspect they're taking account slow vaccination program Germany + event success relying international tourism future policies still quite uncertain.

As total aside, Germany get stabilized September \*and\* allow international tourists, one could much pleasant relaxing experience food beer, better, Munich / Bavaria without insane crowds relatively small areas, probably better hotel rates. Go get J&amp;J! really. Atleast weeks ago police enforce one going take court. chance something like happening would someone who's fined hosting house party takes court Meh largely matter point cases minimal month 6 weeks depends live. They've required outside live, unnecessary imo. But, rule. Damn first doses :( thank scientists! hopefully lower aged kiddos follow shortly What's valid religious exemption? stupid point.

We're point nationally doses wasted even matter anymore anyway. Shots readily available everywhere now.  that‚Äôs don‚Äôt understand. point I‚Äôm looked like I‚Äôm crazy get downvotes. Oh well girls last family, everyone else fully vaccinated. would like see grandparents again! older girl going school two days week.

I‚Äôve checking updates constantly since pfizer asked amendment. Covid waves: keep calm, spike, it'll soon stabilize! Lol fool. take vaccine except sinovax parent, worried infection among US children. think ""Put worry bulk risk is"" naive. global level that's biggest problem is, micro/personal level different risks. like saying ""F problems son, children starving Africa"". Basically Covid gets infecting surface cell (albeit one skin, like nasal passages) cell explodes deeper process continues. unless made vaccine infectious (which would illness itself) no. would much difficult control getting right amount body. person learning schools hybrid virtually same. teachers pretty much teach screen physically there. True person learning happening schools. Considering back day go school Florida without Hep B, MMR, vaccines, ridiculous idea unless nutjob..

I'm statistically safe vaccinated person (and back back vaccine queue), make sense need participate pandemic theater. moreover, society benefits sooner return normal habits.

Vacationing, going parties, going crowded places, meeting lots new people, avoiding masks whenever possible. Moderna must work pretty damn good I'm still good here. gotta say post-covid world pretty cool. know locked long made get outta shell confident approaching new people, they're approachable, little bit both, great. can't remember last time fun past weeks feels like start. ....BUT FREEDOMS!!!!! issue India seems partly tied problems reliable testing. Canada, ban, flights India COVID cases arriving every day, despite requirement negative test flight. Flights from
India made bulk flight alerts often multiple actively-ill people arriving flight. occasional scattered cases flights international locations (US, even border closed; Europe well), usually one two per 1-2 week reporting period, many considering many flights still arrive. You‚Äôd expect tests aren‚Äôt perfect but, combined reports labs willing sell faked negative pre-flight tests, there‚Äôs way level ill travellers, despite testing requirements, currently sustainable. 

We may currently outbreak variant India one quarantine facilities, even isn‚Äôt working well enough (our ‚Äúquarantine‚Äù far less strict Australia‚Äôs). great news! makes way easier walk-in appointments logistics doctor's offices.

Also page: 1 110,000 children 5 die norovirus. way fatal coronavirus. good reason question value emergency use vaccine coronavirus children (post adults vaccinated). look public health authorities sound science consistency. Every nation right responsibility vaccinate citizens first. addition, practical terms, wealthiest countries ones critical get back track economically. imagine US underwent outbreak like India's?

EUA come FDA? know different typical approval process like random approval without science back up. number high. 9.3M residents 78% 18+, 7.2M adults.

Yeah, good luck. Looks like Russia might start exporting doses stockpiled population, expire. Unless something changes. Yes, it‚Äôs called investigative journalism. pretty surprised despite 7day avg still like 49k cases

That's, part, vaccine available yet people 16. kids 12-15 approved would expect number drop drop even &lt;12 approved. probably Lupus. feel like switch flipped sub somewhere suddenly article covid America completely positive biased scaremongering

I get someone might upset title article, probably could considered click-bait, article seems like fair nuanced summary complicated scientific question.

It‚Äôll happen anywhere everywhere unchecked transmission. expect variants places unless/until get enough people vaccinated. would also consider ""excellent"" short time ranges.

The vaccines seem better, imagine still need booster shots. Michael Lewis - guy always inside story ""what really happened"" sell books.   Polio long term effect, problem caused rushed job. still working figure well COVID-19 vaccines prevent vaccinated people transmitting virus others.""

I guess know better scientists? say know, rather, question. Like said earlier, there's nothing wrong questioning things, trying learn something. still answered question.

Yes, excluded airliners putting others risk illness put concentration camps gassed religion. would say numbers great. CVS Walgreens also enormous. single entities big also vaccines? Walmart one think of. So, looking single biggest wasters using raw numbers, would three would expect.

It would useful use %.

Makes think bad could without vaccine rollout. clickbait article give data total doses administered companies actual waste hard judge. Given ultra difficult storage requirements vaccines, sound bad me. Less 200k wasted 189.5 million actually sounds pretty good. Well someone master's degree mechanical engineering good university, I'm telling cannot get grad scheme ""any remotely large company"" 6 figure salary age 30. world living in? It‚Äôd strong/active immune system causing response

Definitely not, anyone actively preaches danger society. fact one Jesus‚Äôs disciples physician. definitely can‚Äôt speak all, lot parish‚Äôs priests doctors pharmacists would never tell anyone seek medical help bad! say, entire population US get struck lightning, size people could die covid vaccination smaller that.....but hand, I'll take wild guess 20 people died covid serious conditions likely going die from.  bullshit language eg ""incentive innovate"". idea innovation happens profit motivation. disproven already vaccines developed PUBLIC MONEY, public WANTS CORONAVIRUS END.

But good job regurgitating propaganda foundation exists 1) launder Bill Gates' image heartless capitalist 2) make money. coworker‚Äôs brother got first shot many serious issues shortly dr told can‚Äôt get second one way able done vaccine. know TON people he‚Äôs one know told DR shouldn‚Äôt get second shot. 

Long story short: nearly died. Covax scheme expected distribute least 100 million doses worldwide end March, 38 million jabs delivered far. Right, deadline now, means they're saying right think able happen fall. You‚Äôre talking pandemic could last 2024 poor countries . Maybe radiolab?

Otherwise I'd think something like surprised previous bad leadership hand slowing up. I‚Äôm ok decision, haven‚Äôt heard major complaints circle friends/family. 

It‚Äôs super fun get tested every week, we‚Äôve got pretty smooth system running, it‚Äôs quick accesible. 

Personally, got AZ J&amp;J know would constant state extreme worry two weeks (and panic every slight hint headache), happy miss that.

And last summer indication we‚Äôre looking now, think Danish summer ok (last year summer, cases almost dissappeared outdoor/indoor venues open safety rules place. get problem.

Main issue travel. ready take vaccine able travel (and yell NANANANANANANA tried tell name vaccine). joke article, Vaccine Canada share? supply limited (currently 2 million doses week).  
even sent supply India, 2 million doses would enough vaccinate around 0.01% indias 1.3 billion people. Canada 2 million doses would cover 6% population.  
that alone shows ridiculous also throw fact going third wave currently.  rollout working Germany?

But plenty evidence vaccines fact prevent partly true, Denmark bought enough BioNTech vaccinate entire population older 16. goes Moderna CureVac.

Thats true also cant administer many jabs could reduced supply. yes, knew switch mostly second doses still capacity administer jabs done atm. got downvoted, laughed. WH urge vaccinations US? literally job offer protection US citizens.

At time, help countries. either/or. see non-emergency authorization? want see places requiring vaccine already. extreme example, unvaccinated person Australia currently safer vaccinated person US due basically zero community spread Australia.

This exactly indoor dining cases drop background levels. good getting 95% effective vaccine immediately start increasing risk factor 20? isn‚Äôt necessarily true though. Nordics many cases (not compared number vaccinated) narcolepsy following swine flu vaccine. I‚Äôm sure actually triggered less immediately wasn‚Äôt known long time after. cause IIRC genetic predisposition combined vaccine booster agent w/e it‚Äôs called English. fair, risk likely less things friend like driving car.

.01% vaccinated people getting sick. 500 87 million getting hospitalized covid receiving vaccine.

Honestly flu probably worse catching covid vaccinated.

People understand much risk changes vaccinated. experience person kids failing high rates distance learning kids. format work anyone. talking someone legitimately classroom; format schools enforced upon teachers hybrid formatting sucks everyone, even person everyone lesson still ultimately dictated distance learners. 

If true person learning would different, we've told cater distance learners first, person.   month ago 40,000 people packed Texas ranger stadium without masks social distancing. Texas' cases sharp decline. talk passports nonsense. Sure already vaccinated. need evaluate risk individual well society whole. would unethical risk death couple young people save lives couple old ones. Know Danish authorities considered giving vaccine 60-64 year olds (the next vaccine line), even group - situation Denmark moment - risks outweigh benefits Nepal reported record 7,137 new COVID-19 cases Sunday Nearly 40 per cent people tested returned positive result

I'm scientist, scientific bonafides (my minor biology, adult, I've contributed software libraries used acknowledged scientists several published academic papers, though mostly chemistry), understanding no, there's reason believe this.

Vaccines physical substances, like anything else, get used pretty quickly.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* great see grandparents Death stats definitive one things uniformly maintained globally. That‚Äôs it‚Äôs impossible say pandemic death rates exaggerated since since average rates stand prominently. think virus stand chance amount alcohol flowing people's veins there. really practical difference like 2000 Covid cases day nationwide zero though? Restrictions gonna gone soon anyway, cases plummeting can't see production centers mRNA vaccines can't set up. like building factories scratch, high tech factories qualified workforces world. Well either get vaxxed eventually get COVID contribute overall immunity way. too. US covid death count lower excess death count, although huge amount about, seems reasonably assume US slightly undercounting deaths India undercounting much larger error. scientific decision made weeks ago AstraZeneca vaccine removed danish vaccination program. way also announced Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine won‚Äôt used program either.

This story offering individuals option getting one vaccines anyways wish. seems like individual concrete decision rather blanket recommendation whole population may involve informational conversation doctor day‚Äôs deliberation period.

The danish politicians announced hour ago going ahead this. Basically hose two vaccines demoted recommended everyone offered want it. mean atleast it‚Äôs brainer. 

In US 1 person got sick like 5 million something along lines.  
Those odds easily live with. US LOT obese people. still contract. afford one wife hahha. 

I work global firm. firm pay high-cost cities... however adjustment linear. 

While might make 5-10% less colleagues cities, costs 50% less colleagues. 

Likewise, colleagues offshore locations like India make dramatically less, comparatively live much better due low cost living. 

I think exodus California due large part high cost living. keep reading articles California techie workers leaving SFO places like Austin Texas others get income haircut live like kings compared SFO. get people understand this. Vaccine side effects close time vaccination.

You going trigger immune response, response end, see random effects years later. never happened.

Your immune response either causes damage doesn't. immune response randomly reappear year vaccine material gone. never happened fundamentally makes sense.

The FDA guidelines completely reflect this. We're waiting efficacy data. Since politics religion involves this, people never gonna change opinion. Maybe months people make minds, that, yeah gonna change. Novavax refused sign contract, EU. fact contract still signed. mean practice measures like masks distancing? You‚Äôre pretty ‚Äúneoliberal‚Äù maybe nice name wokish corporatists. Dutch making better decisions Danish. here! 8 5 year old homeschooled year. I'm ready go back fall. developing world likely mobile internet connection plumbing Fifteen years ago Nepal, got internet laptop edge network mobile phone. Personally, got AZ J&amp;J know would constant state extreme worry two weeks

This would worst part. Even though know super rare, would make super nervous I'm pretty sure stress alone would give headache. US saves world again. autumn, nearly developed countries offered first vaccine dose willing adults.

This applies Germany, countries Oktoberfest tourists come from.

To cancel absurd demonstrates level caution excessive touch reality.

The novel coronavirus stay circulate least remainder decade.

Under approach, there's nothing stopping Oktoberfest large events getting cancelled many years come, unless people learn factor risks benefits properly. Oh get it. friends haven‚Äôt let 5 year old leave house 14 months. guarantee kid going shell former self spending 20% life complete isolation. Imaging reaction starts talking friends year realizes weren‚Äôt locked home isolated. likely type sterile injectable one vaccines? biologics/biosimiliars? someone industry you‚Äôve asked usually talking point companies block sort generic treatment. patent evergreening trick. Manufacturing issues around. Go fierce pharma government website search 483 issues US facilities. astoundingly common drastically repetitive. agree better get first dose whenever possible vaccine can't obtained 2nd dose, get different vaccine. 

I know CDC authorized mixing Moderna Pfizer necessary, agree immunological perspective probably make huge difference, tested can't say anything definitive safety efficacy mixing. Hi there. I'm sorry going this. Unfortunately, nobody really equipped speak types things. I'd advise talking doctor(s). wish best. Florindia...  played huge role dropping deaths, however UK spent year far much stricter lockdown. Croatia actually open tourists. go tomorrow wanted. forced sell patent R&amp;D cost.

The R&amp;D mostly done government funded research. They're taking bath research costs, losing profits bullshit system public research turned money printing machine big pharma. Yay! wish tons fun doggie park zoomies her! specific owners labs say could totally it, demonstrated vaccine manufacturers? Remember novel vaccine platform never deployed scale before.

India, example, manufacturing vaccines license. short raw materials. yet, 35m vaccinated (1 dose, 16m 2 dose) plus natural immunity line horizon. children covid deadly all. 12-15 huge getting schools back normal, least middle high school level. Hopefully news provides relief anxious parents reach full herd immunity end goal

Herd immunity never goal. goal always 1) protect healthcare systems collapsing 2) protect vulnerable (65+/co-morbidities). US needs come grips next weeks. We're already 83% 65+ vaccinated. 55% adult population vaccinated probably 20% unvaxxed natural immunity prior infection we're pretty close healthcare system overall danger. We're going see vocal minority people insisting things shut we're near zero daily cases need start sending message science-based opinion. Lol almost sounds like puppy past week healing spay. Luckily done week go dog park Saturday! time 2 weeks 2nd vaccine shot well. Also Floridian F this. can't local municipalities continue make local decisions? interfering this? first Pfizer, turned away hospital 2nd reactions first. I‚Äôm still covered rash almost 5 weeks later. FWIW, allergic reaction, almost side effects. team doctors charge nurse speak time, I‚Äôm going consult another doctor NP. 

I Covid March 2020 &amp; one dose mRNA, okay. studies show negligible difference 2nd dose Covid. concerned since may able get boosters. 

As stands now, though, I‚Äôm continuing live life like entirety pandemic. 16 month old, 9 year old 12 year old able get vaccinated yet. won‚Äôt resuming level normality house vaccinated (hopefully winter?). 

My husband works home taken last 16 months work midwife since baby born. planning stay home 6 months so, take low client volume, pandemic hit decided I‚Äôd stay home indefinitely. **Over-80s show similar antibody responses following single vaccination either Pfizer AstraZeneca vaccine ‚Äì cellular responses enhanced AstraZeneca vaccine -** Bring can, otherwise likely end two cards. Easier one. Curious seen reaction regarding risk assessment among friends post vaccine? live mostly normally now, fully vaccinated friends still terrified getting sick. seems...silly?  come work America. corrupt capitalist driven healthcare system reward hospital big bucks American people suffer. Still, assume would plenty people 40+ people various risk factors covid (obesity etc...) J&amp;J/AZ would still worth relatively small risk. mean Denmark's public health experts likely done math handle pandemic pretty well comparing nations providing access volunteers least would make sense me. would nice gave indication chemotherapy drugs associated lack antibody development. go extra step. 8 year old twins here, they're super pumped get theirs. least they're totally isolated other.... though worry twin connection growing powerful. day I'm expecting talk unison full time like hive mind! India death count severely undercounted. Still waiting final shoe drop cancel Berlin Marathon.

Though marathon still planning advertising going forward. bad area, there's high risk infant family, two friends functioning immune system speak of, bet I'm upset. feels like thing never over. heard Canadian Ottawa huge outbreaks truck drivers still crossing Michigan transport. that's one theory. Kind makes sense.  people UK reached herd immunity. 

So mean drink blood immortal?  youtube censoring debates ivy league epidemiologists citing ""misinformation""?

Not relevant here. Pre-covid, never used hand sanitizer go way wash hands eating. think twice getting train immediately chowing something food cart. kind gross retrospect.  That‚Äôs population England. population UK (which figure about) 66.65m even impressive!  Maybe yes, maybe no. Depends whether Germany implements vaccine passport entry. Anti-Vaxxers turn green. vaccines caused drop relative EU  Sure can. eliminated risk cars pose, allow sensible regulation (speed limits, seatbelts). haha - I'm asian :) rice cooker - oldest hates rice pasta. two eat it, three want milk, meat, yogurt. source this? recent paper saw highly correlated political views anti-vaxx. risk individuals home letting others free never worked

We never know one tried. Well, least pandemic. it, common sense. Yeah many cases go unreported US due people able afford go hospital. importantly, want get vaccinated protect yourself, help others out. 

If get vaccinated helping protect neighbors, supporting local hospital's ICU / ER, helping local businesses open remain opened. Good news, however provider 100 mile radius Pfizer stock links  Nothing bill gates? hell smoking? fact remains vaccine production capacity would far higher Pfizer moderna refuse participate expanding global manufacturing. 

You cannot wave around sort weird magical thing possibly produced, currently newly produced. I'm fully vaccinated still anxiety due crazy variants like Indian, African, Brazilian, etc.. vaccines 100% question...so area i'm living restaurants bars starting open 100% capacity. friends vaccinateded tossed idea go bar celebrate. one friend said would absolutely go full capacity bar. question we're vaccinated, anything actually worried anymore? like ok go out, thought whole point getting vaccinated? start moving towards normal life again. know variants etc i've heard vaccines effective well, unless i'm mistaken.    Rice, lots rice game changer, good rice cooker feel bad ya. Please let vaccine scientist four decades know vaccines side effects picked two months shot. could really use information seem sitting on.  hope Chicago Illinois, we're going lucky hit 60%. city, CDC governors overly cautious killing demand among young healthy people told nothing changes get vaccinated. time, century well deserved mistrust medical community among many minority groups. rural areas, Fox Sinclair set stage low uptake. Don‚Äôt know you‚Äôre downvoted. think laid people anxiety Covid would thinking. took almost winter 5 flu deaths reported Las Vegas year. disappeared going either. since testing like normal C-19 numbers appear news. Oh okay, makes sense, got friday already injected, that's got 700.000 weekend Like said, agree Oktoberfest probably uncertain financially viable, although would probably fine October. study touched willingness get vaccine, focused conspiracy theories wing-nut media sources actually receiving vaccine. agree. Especially daily thread, one wants consider community prevalence. People feel bulletproof vaccine understand people might cautious. Two deaths per day considerably less 1 death million. Even 1 death week extra month 1 death million.  Ahhh, yes, temporary measure. heard before?

""By July pretty much everyone wants vaccine one.""

I also heard before. Except May. July, September.

""In meantime, sounds unfair what's alternative? Keeping boomers home well?""

It mental, absurd, keep young people less susceptible disease house arrest freeing high risk groups. told point prevent collapsing pressure healthcare services, pretty much achieved point. Open everyone, period. regulators' decision Monday deny emergency use authorization vaccine blown all-out international row, Sputnik V's makers accusing ""knowingly spreading false inaccurate information"" without testing vaccine themselves.  Brazilian agency, Anvisa, based decision evidence vaccine carried live version adenovirus, common cold-causing virus.  V's maker, Gamaleya Institute, reiterated insistence vaccine contained replicating virus.  Sputnik V vaccine uses two different adenovirus vectors accomplish task, administered two shots.  slideshow presented Anvisa regulators, agency determined booster shot ""replication competent"" -- meaning inside body, adenovirus continue multiply.  added likely occurred manufacturing problem. Weird sentiment you‚Äôre parroting lobbying angencies.... 

I‚Äôd say concrete information vaccine production could increased lifting IP. It‚Äôs suppositions side refusing lift it. ‚ÄúOh wouldn‚Äôt actually increase because....‚Äù manufactures saying could making now. ‚ÄúOh maybe possibly sort implications future pandemics‚Äù yea that‚Äôs absurd chart Seattle Children's hospital recommends adult doses Tylenol anyone weighs 96 lbs more: stuff. agree specific enough. said vaccines directly protect 5% people getting symptomatic COVID. August, autumn Someone read article Thats mean. unvaccinated, risk vaccinated people correct?  Vaccines work well old people, approved children yet. least next months think lot vaccinated people go places sure everyone else vaccinated.  don‚Äôt know indoor dining said you‚Äôre protected you‚Äôll ever be? now, when? discriminate want vaccinated can't? strategy ultimately fail. Elimination impossible point even 100% population vaccinated. Unless plan keep borders closed rest time continuously lock individual cases inevitably pop up. made assertion. 

I asked back up. burden made assertion. athletes wil pre quarantine countries lab tests, fly japan, quarantine special hotels, lab tests.

And try keep athletes away much possible,

Correct. think accident vaccination rates decreasing vulnerable want vaccinated gotten vaccinations we're trying vaccinate people care much health consequences Covid, health related reasons going work well- social incentives needed. possibility production delays probably makes sense spread many manufacturers possible, especially Moderna approved less-strict refrigeration protocols. I‚Äôm sure end using every dose, even next year. next-year Moderna doses could reconfigured new variants.   Dont think fall. Dr Fauci said early next year.  I'm railing misinformation all, that's hyberbole. I'm simply agreeing (assuming article factual, different claim) statement Pfizer developed vaccine record time achievement true.

This article focuses credit say regulatory logistical hurdles. hurdles exist, they're easy get around sometimes. I'm saying Pfizer hero story, every article one-sided.
