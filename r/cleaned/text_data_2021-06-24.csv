0,2021-06-24," vaccinated, everyone family age 12 vaccinated, city vaccinated, pandemic us.

As children, plenty viruses far dangerous children COVID take granted, including RSV. cases low area someone else use dose instead, absolutely value waiting. Someone else's immune system get boost sooner better immunity getting dose later.

People look funny though. info anyone wants it.

Sure. date, lacking right context, new.... dosage almost 3x much, likely higher response likely generally side effects.

I antibodies measure 2.5 mo post Moderna antibodies maxed scale test. clearly we're fucking idiots, rite? People fucking tired it. want people? real privilege okay lockdowns constantly. lot us ruined financially mental health deteriorated. Vaccines out, else do? Yeah, they‚Äôve also saying along needed get like 70-80% even close herd immunity. Didn‚Äôt that.

But since people stubborn time money (in places vaccine access) we‚Äôre seeing places opening back 50-60%. technically didn‚Äôt actually recommended can‚Äôt really turn around say ‚ÄúI thought said everything would fine now!‚Äù deadly though, since fuck load people can't get now. pandemic vaccinated. Yes, clearly would less harmful leave things continue let social distancing masks work
 
Although I'm betting *unique* ideas masks Must nice live intelligent country citizens value science. Hilda damn smart. quarantine wear masks life small minority? cases (and therefore hospitalizations deaths) start rising Delta, sure could make recommendations. Everyone would listen already gotten vaccinated though, there's much benefit them. girl knew swimming high school caught it. school weeks &amp; also broke rib. I'll never forget skinny came back. coughed could see crazy muscles around ribs stand way far.
 
Ugh, hideous disease. Human=stupid  Yeah CDC mentions small number pet dogs gotten it: flu vaccines hits 40-60% best years. often much lower. Different virus class though. people running headline - saying vaccinate kids, saying vaccinate vulnerable (in countries) vaccinating kids. 'flu killing kids five post agriculture human history: SARS-CoV-2 killing kids five year half.
What point? Better safe sorry. Nuke planet orbit start over. low-risk going safe vaccination. eat? 7k upvotes? ‚Äúmild case‚Äù keeps getting worse. job kept sending home sudden gastro symptoms two months last negative test‚Äî afraid going infect everyone. hair keeps falling out. I‚Äôd say lost 70% it. said body aches anxiety horrible. granted three week leave absence. 
She fit weightlifter aerobics instructor it‚Äôs taken completely out. 
I let know she‚Äôs alone. ""Original antigenic sin"" exposed disease much, body starts treating similar diseases (like different coronavirus variants) exactly like it. could risk, nobody's seen anything like coronaviruses probably unlikely.

If doses close together could certainly imagine stronger side effects happening. weird stuff myocarditis clotting issues, though seems unlikely. maybe even go full Sweet Tooth, also took hallucinogens time.

Most likely really angry immune system ready kick ass take names. ass name SARS-CoV-2 virus, specifically. might indeed world's greatest superhero.

This could actually effective public relations move. Take vaccines run sub-3-hour marathon, something. brag awesome getting vaccinated is. you‚Äôre high risk category even worry ü§∑üèø‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

The vaccines still new . Personally I‚Äôd recommend waiting entire year fully observe vaccinated population. ( unless you‚Äôre high risk category get ASAP) 
 
None constitutes medical advice consult medical provider, parents doctor safety efficacy vaccines relation .  Reading hit actually happened me. Aunts mother died couple months ago COVID. couple weeks died dream it. weird dream people rushing see tell someone died. pulled car got said something like ""glad see ok"". I've never dreamt lady life dream since.  confirmed covid November 2020 suspected either January February 2020 (my boss definitely it, didn‚Äôt go doctor sick similar symptoms roughly 3 days behind her). lungs trash. sister scuba diver REALLY wants go literally cannot.

I‚Äôm winded running one side house dog. doctor telling may need using inhaler daily. something I‚Äôd wish anyone. mention effects memory. already space cadet forget I‚Äôm saying midway through. least writing go back re-read find point again.  infections unvaccinated already decided wasnt problem. need boosters rolling TON faster initial rollout since theres supply limitation (that itll likely roll effectively fast inital since gap time based first was) media longer talking Covid due Trump longer president.  like 0.00016% chance experiencing heart issues vaccines. Probably less since teenager. Maybe chance history.

Either way, 48 hours mostly past point concern anyway. Bcuz ignorance easier. outcomes dead full recovery. even death, small chance, might worth take risk. Great news. EU follow suit soon. Belgium 57.31 percent entire population least one jab, increasing pace .70 .80 percent per day. already I'm worried it.. ethical obligation protect unvaccinated adults. ones cant get vaccine ought taking extreme precautions anyways, ones already decided risk theyre willing take. Basically rare exceptions deaths unvaccinated ought big concern. got shots still wear mask ~75% time (everywhere except restaurants, I'm going again). 

But honest I'm following general consensus one. 

I can't care someone else refuses shot.

I'm level best carrier that's do. guys lucky. live Japan it'll still least 3 months every adult chance. never over, take initiative take proper care body get active. bodies fought infectious disease since Adam Eve. really tough call make growing person. anything go wrong might blame choosing go (or not, catch virus). need support, time pass. :( Karmaic!  IIRC used analysis tools provided Google. entry technically deleted database, file persisted afterwards (not cleared) researcher still able access it. work high risk industry. string positives.

I knew even vaccines, could still catch it.

I'm trying survive. I'm trying prevent spreading others.

Tests available everywhere us. Easy get. Willful ignorance would happy allow unvaccinated cruisers long hourly covid tests. use Klingon pain sticks instead swabs. Kind unique situation religious right more-or-less explicitly dominant minority (they charge religious policies, including weddings, burials, conversions Judaism), ultra-Orthodox rabbis much easier win over. Also, Covid death rates among ultra-Orthodox Jews (including beloved elders) high choice. Read article. Every study ivermectin shown work, countries pushing almost universally highest population mortality countries.

The solution cure humanity sars-cov-2 immune system, miracle drug. coworker tested positive.

My parents, vaccinated, mom medication might mute vaccines effectiveness.

Came back positive drive test Walgreens confirm. Congestion/runny nose symptom COVID much rare likely cold allergies symptom. dangerous get vaccinated COVID infection may conflate COVID symptoms vaccine side effects make diagnosis difficult.

If test positive otherwise diagnosed COVID, recommended wait isolation period data article cites also 2020 number likely much higher, closer 3 million deaths. Nope, poster interpreted correctly. article's main point black Hispanic life expectancies dropped nearly FOUR YEARS US vs 3 months average 16 countries. Someone glib ignorant said pandemic duh, pointed entire point article. pregnant relative it. She‚Äôs afraid side effects‚Ä¶ guess she‚Äôll go side effects post birth, kid well?  think misreading statistics. source: 


57.5% received *at least* one dose. 48.9% fully vaccinated. 48.9% part 57.5%, hence ""at least."" 


The 85% aspirational number would hopefully bring herd immunity. NYTimes article today covers. Cross vaccine use starting various reasons it‚Äôll likely option regulators approve it. Apparently Angela merkel used two different google search figure world talking led corner internet would never dreamed existed. :) too, wear mask next years, reason wear mask. sister vaxx-hesitant, seeing impending newborn fully vaccinated. Praying that's motivation enough get jab. Relax. fully vaccinated. Also true vaccine people around covid anymore. problem rest world. Everyone vaccinated soon anti vaxxers die off! Lol Natural Selection Also know can‚Äôt vote within 6 years dogs? know theyve said cats lions maybe zoo animals. cant remember seeing dogs.

There ton articles dogs training sniff covid ive never seen say used. imagine dogs would gotten covid presumably would tested see ever got animals dogs one actually data on. baby wouldn't. much, baby probably keep home right now. 2 kids 12. still keep safe. cheeky kids like traditional masks leave large gaps try kf94's, work great faces. comparable kn95's us lack gaps makes 1% difference negligible. Popcorn anyone? Fresh batch, extra butter. saying there's limited evidence indoor masking vaccinated make impact spread? assertion literally zero. nasty. know specifically, less dangerous flu.

However, virus allowed continue circulating wide scale, time risk vaccine resistant variant arising increases. Last thing want see reintroduction restrictions due this, ignorance others.  quite effective delta variant. 

It isn't. still get vaccinated (only moron wouldn't).

But holy he'll, need see Israel opion this. dangerous vaccines less effective. feel like Delta virus effective tends hang around upper respiratory tract vaccinated people longer gets neutralized, test positive brief period become sick.

That means unvaccinated people could infected vaccinated people window, people need get vaccinated soon able.  Winken appointed special envoy, Professor Nod presentations. took many vaccines someone else got vaccinated you?

I agree you. Japan failed many ways.   

It look like disaster coming Japan.  

I say border control quarantine measures seem decent much much better countries.

We don't. war covid meant end. like war drugs never ended war terror similar thing. Without getting specifics, think way. 100% people vaccinated, cases would vaccinated people.

Please captain america. Don‚Äôt mean sound callous, sounds like natural selection.

I think last week's number Thursday number 814,459, right? confused 7 day average went week-on-week number went up. Genuine question: getting worse many us getting vaccinated? dont fucking understand point article? trying say uneven distribution vaccine rich poor countries? headline makes fucking sense. trying say US relax rules b/c covid still high countries? sounds like dumb idea.

Hi, vaccine tuesday. However Mixed feelings actually it. family friends fine getting shot. im still scared side effects. 

EVERY YouTube watch horror comments scary sideeffekts people gotten. Everyone social media saying poison, could Long term scary side effects. 

What believe? subreddit place found people positive vaccine. someone explain shouldnt scared taking vaccine? Im 18 years Old btw. Looks like saves Moderna research money since say similar Pfizer /s   scary part even vaccine still get expose child. likely actually next get shot? Could go them, quietly explain nurse what's going on, nurse wave needle near arm stick bandaid on? agree! good idea let mild asymptomatic cases fall radar. continue track keep list separate, see trends form? Would used much manpower? understand logic. Guess unvaccinated die problem fix actually concern? haven‚Äôt seen anyone report   Perhaps...the Delta variant well. vaccine lower efficacy vs Delta, maybe combination factors. people dying fully vaxxed...prob much likely Delta variant. it‚Äôs anything like stats Canada, it‚Äôs old immune compromised people vaccinations didn‚Äôt work.  think two doses.

Just speculation highly likely follows typical distribution pattern, highly correlated general risk death adults. 

I'm sure eventually healthy 25 year old die despite fully vaccinated, talking powerball odds here. Got second shot past weekend. Still wearing mask next two weeks give time thang'.

Will probably always wear mask gym though. Can't smell everyone else's BO like privacy feel gives environment! doesn‚Äôt apply israel.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Source? argument Danes vaccinating young adults millennials try limit transmission. I‚Äôm sure think increased transmissibility contingent upon greater viral shedding alone. factors, like inhibition innate interferon response, could also result increased transmissibility virus decreasing dose required successful infection.

I think you‚Äôre taking narrow definition ‚Äútransmissibility‚Äù ignoring broader epidemiological consequences virus spreads readily population.

At rate, new research showing Delta‚Äôs increased transmissibility explained increase cleaved spike proteins surface. dismiss data too? Good  Anyone least concerned Delta Plus variant? add bit more: Novavax using vaccine technology used HepB pertussis vaccines. Thank explanation.

So people essentially saying it‚Äôs involves similar process, making people jump making comparisons flu shot?   smallpox scar got child. times got Pfizer vaccines, smallpox scar turned pink/red. received second dose days ago, scar pink sure occured! 

My fiance skin reactions first Pfizer dose second, developed rash think COVID arm. also got sick day second dose.

This big move. heath department knows something don't. read study shows difference effective immunity natural immunity natural immunity vaccine. sure factors in, it‚Äôs interesting.  Yep. relative risk. (Thinking) people getting shot making calculation risk contracting COVID * risk bad outcome risk bad outcome vaccine.
The real relative risk probably something like title makes sound like middle school science fair get 2 shots 1 yearly flu yearly covid vaccine 1? I'm accepting this. vulnerable btw. Please tell treated tinnitus, started going today. vaccine receive received doses. would greatly appreciate it. apologize grammar, English first language.  think Canada currently leading Western world people least one dose, we're slowing around 75% eligible population.

What Ireland showing? Welcome Reddit. Unfortunately lot close minded selfish individuals post Yeah don‚Äôt see mask wearing coming back US worst happen. Certain states outlawing mask mandates restricting public health putting restrictions. Other, Covid believing states could however issues orders again.

The problem places restrictions won‚Äôt, places likely low vaccinated population. we‚Äôll go it. 

Basically I‚Äôve come conclusion variant worst case scenario back square one another separate pandemic happened, US would mostly fucked even worse first time. preprint, posted yesterday bioRxiv, say Bloom‚Äôs detective work much ado nothing, Chinese scientists later published viral information different form, recovered sequences add little what‚Äôs known SARS-CoV-2‚Äôs origins. auto immune disease got 2 Pfizer shots. It‚Äôs big picture counts.  another one bites dust! majority deaths cited happening poorer countries got vaccine wide scale yet.

It's really choice point.  Amazing! Thanks info üëçüèª Better Australia. 4%.  Watch Dr John Campbell‚Äôs report YouTube today, 6/24/21. Third wave COVID-19 predicted October, 2021 young.

Something's gotta give though cuz agree flat dangerous country. you, cumshot_josh. free asked Sweden imposed restrictions. answer yes. Good night good luck. It‚Äôs definitely predictable case it‚Äôs dangerous here‚Äôs why

The insanity doesn‚Äôt stop hyper partisan idiots Internet forums. It‚Äôs prevalent leadership. Government response, sides clearly swayed political narratives . activities entities like teachers unions employers. ‚Ä¶If happens again, trust can, we‚Äôre going know believe look real leadership direction right, bud That's wrong. one thing people different cult suddenly care when, when, affects personally. I'd still get chemo even little protection better none comes disease. right knew coming back getting relatively soon (Moderna wazoo) mid-July (Pfizer pushing part couple shipments back), decent chance Moderna.

But Pfizer, see additional restrictions globally folks mixed vaccines long 2nd dose mRNA. time we're really looking going places, probably booster shots available. That's good thing. good Delta less good enough minor variations like Delta Plus.  qapla! Many scientists claiming Covid 19 virus natural phenomenon. Then, evidence started emerge altered virology lab. also stated every person get vaccine. suggesting already contracted virus, need it, may even pose risk young people. think I'll wait bit longer trust current version science relating pandemic. really blame me? Covid trigger anyway? wife Gulian Barr kid flu shot. Took J&amp;J ill effects... OOH close 8:30. people survive lockdown? 

You imagine covid would ravaging nation restaurants closed 9:30 instead. Yeah would damn bloodbath. total covid deaths, specific Delta-variant strain. source posted came UK, impacted Delta strain earlier US, therefore data.

Also, hell downvoting asking relevant question? variants mutants! canary meant Missouri becoming cautionary tale rest country Want know really effective Pfizer vaccine is? Keep eye Israel. problem! was, glad home vaccinated. Hope go back one day better times.  get it? need it, otherwise poor Exactly. really gross see, guess *kinda* understandable based polarized everyone there? Well still spread virus others even vaccinated. still good measure around elderly people masks wear masks courteous. 


Some people real reasons can't get vaccinated, everyone who's vaccinated that's walking around masks threat like anyone else. Pfizer people make Penises work Restaurants close 8:30 pm Germany, civilians whole wait outside pharmacies chance get leftover shot. constantly calling doctors. 

In America, walk vaccine site get shot instantly. 

Very sad. people even get flu shot regularly. feel like rates rise now, odd people suddenly care new virus that's less likely affect children.

Get vaccinated, get kids vaccine available, advocating restrictions 8 year olds vaccinated dumb. I‚Äôve work since last August, many colleagues never left. work higher education.

Also cannot vaccinated due health reasons absolutely file ADA reasonable accommodations continue working home due lack mandated masks buildings (Missouri) mandate vaccine (good luck). issue quality source instead age article considering much lab-leak theory news last month. issue discussed since long time sub I'm fairly confident post repost well. get vaccinated, got Pfizer vaccine didn‚Äôt experience symptoms except sore ass arm haha. first bout pretty bad close month, second time mild, runny nose diarrhea, also eye infected like day.. weird.  Idk guys, there's one question that's still mind people (me included) never got Covid. 

I direct contact brother (before confirmed), Mom (before confirmed separate occasion) wife basically shared everything got covid test back (as certain would get attended dinner). 

On 3 occassions (that know of) never RT-PCR test antibody tests negative (the tests made 1 month after). 

I know anecdotal stuff, back February 2020 first case confirmed country sore throat coughed 2 weeks chills last 2 days period (nothing worry time perspective could anything). Now, brother first confirmed 6 months passed felt pretty much couple days. mom it, felt same. wife it. Here's kicker, felt got first dose vaccine. 

So here's question. related? February 2020 helped getting infected whole period? virus doesn‚Äôt care you‚Äôre 16 not. It‚Äôs still population vulnerable catching it, even it‚Äôs population suffers it. considering immunity, total population immunity important. I'm going modify metaphor bit one. Imagine SARS-Cov-2 Ford F150 pickup truck. generational differences, different trims, different colors many different variations essence pickup truck identifiable shape. mRNA vaccine description ""outer silhouette shape information"" said pickup truck inform immune system (let's call ""Parking Enforcement Officers""). vehicle, matching description F150 approaches gate (ACE2) cell, PEO's gonna tow vehicle best abilities. matter what's hood. might modified F150 electric one. safety cell vaccine depends difference capabilities PEO's city (as person).

On specific another spike binding receptor, Jeep Gladiator may easily get gate may even able climb curb leading gate, pure speculation point. car person, immediately tell difference looking shape. Current mRNA vaccines teaching immune system ""accurate description F150"".

&amp;#x200B;

It's logical assume Sars-Cov-2 virus ""spikes"" cling ACE2 receptors cell virus target current mRNA vaccines coronavirus since one making us sick moment.

&amp;#x200B;

The beauty mRNA technology is, safely assume there's another viral outbreak, make new descriptions act quicker stop outbreak hopefully epidemic status. contraindicated. bother ineffective. Huge difference.

Also, people need stop providing anecdotes people know. CDC lists contraindications. Go science. That‚Äôs mainly Greece relies tourism economy British tourists tendency spend others.

Yes, many stages skipped. Nobody knows long-term effects produced 14 months. Usually, vaccines produced 7 10 years world covid. So, since produced within 14 months, nobody knows real long-term effects are.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Eh let's agree disagree.  Thanks I'm good.  Norovirus e coli absolutely transmissible enough. Japan managing vaccinated 1 million day supply issues. Seriously, news hardly alarming all. least level peddled shocking past 2-3 weeks. Vaccines still highly effective. Unvaccinated people still get sick. Pfizer Moderna already working vaccine booster target variants. sick shit reporting. Officially, 10k cap. However, connected Games sponsors IOC exempt limit. Also children teachers etc attending games schools program, also counted part 10k cap. Pandemics gonna pandemic, guess. country? people vaccinated not? Let people make risk assessment  Vaccines mitigate risk negligible amount, much like seatbelt. elect use seatbelt (getting vaccinated) elect strap jet harness, likely even improve outcome lead discomfort (mask vaccine). didn‚Äôt listen said don‚Äôt need mask. first time last time. common cold within next years (see: every coronavirus ever).

I think SARS MERS would disagree that... (me high school aged kids) still wear masks we‚Äôve fully vaccinated now. thought months ago take whatever get prevent hospitalization death (which still do) recently I‚Äôve noticed lot rhetoric changing say mRNA better still supposed right?

back home Mexico party group friends mine, vaccinated, week later, siblings vaccinated started getting sick... everyone got tested almsot everyone party COVID almost one showing symptoms... yes, vaccines work great, ongoing experiment ask not. candid assessment data without fear mongering mixed shows vaccines slightly less effective delta variant, though seems efficacy 1 dose greatly diminished. numbers shown, mostly unvaccinated vulnerable. Water wet. media nothing report months positive news needs get dick wet ""delta variant bad"" straddles border misinformation hyperbole. never said user lying, asking source shows asymptomatic means can't transmit covid another unvaccinated person you‚Äôre okay potentially get sick die live ‚Äúbullshit places‚Äù? I‚Äôve heard similar things ‚Äúshithole countries‚Äù people think Puerto Rico foreign country. also deserve compassion. -- states database (all childhood vaccines extended COVID).  I'm thinking keeping mask pocket putting one I'm store there's kids around something. Ok, vaccines far effective we've thought.

But according WHO, still distance (with end sight) could possibility transmission.

I understand, goal illusional zero covid strategy consideration harm social distancing measures cause (especially children teenagers), way.

WHO shows pandemic trustworthy organization. Well wear mask take extra precautions.   Lmao fake science Thank much scientific explanation! :-) I‚Äôm never around babies children I‚Äôm good. delta variant, another one road. becoming binary choice: get vaccinated get dead. problem media. Scientific journalism saw budget cuts. Ontop blatant misinformation lies. 

The average user hard time judge ""expert"" right. Often one person opinion one opinion B selected. viewer thinks ""oh positions must equal"" fact opinion outlier, someone misguided, false prophet say, opinion B actually scientific consensus. course nothing life 0 risk. Thats things help mitigate risk. seat belts, car seats infants masks. Maybe vaccinated Sinovac still continue wearing mask since shitty Chinese vaccine work. mRNA vaccines/J&amp;J/AZ, fine. user responding correct, cases asymptomatic. Also, likely grossly overestimating % data UK, gathered real world peer reviewed studies align it. got work data moment.  I'm asking evidence support alternative hypothesis proposed. far none. I've asking question single person answer. Thanks much posting information. I'm different biologic, Simponi, Remicade years. doctor seem interested antibody tests. hope third dose helps! cure stupid.  Allergic vaccines ffs. Didn‚Äôt get required vaccines infant child? Antibody testing [quite common price quote think equivalent around $30USD. 

Anyone vaccinated developed antibodies offered booster vaccine. Also, anyone vaccinated six months ago Sinopharm eligible another Sinopharm dose course vaccines another brand. Scary see anti-maskers reactionaries getting upvotes comments  Personally masks, hoping someone could show source says can't transmit unvaccinated people. Specifically Senior\_Explanation, person originally responded to, seen post multiple times saying cases Israel asymptomatic. sources see say probably better play safe wear mask certain places trying find flip side since Senior\_Explanation posting source explanation.

Edit: post source says mask wearing delta variant pointless risk low? like lot things Novavax, seems disingenuous suggest Novavax fewer side effects lot side effects vaccines use known millions people taken them. one knew AZ JJ blood clots Pfizer Moderna heart inflammation recently. 

I won‚Äôt blame Novavax Atlantic writer‚Äôs overly enthusiastic writing. I‚Äôd like see balanced analysis. Nah. love numbers. source them? Unlikely impossible. quote said 25x less likely. impossible. That‚Äôs also tracking people show symptoms/test positive COVID-19. doesn‚Äôt account people don‚Äôt get tested don‚Äôt show symptoms. Again, also ignoring caveats new strain. also symptom told every goddamned thing covid symptom. Sorry wasn‚Äôt clear. think everyone continue wear masks. Yeah, fuck babies toddlers preteens! Fucking useless twits! Pffft, company's web developers take 48 hours! What, like everywhere? wear around house? sleep it? Maybe wear field take dog walk?

Why always dumb, simple ""wear mask"" message?

Perhaps better guidance suitable wear might credence.

I'm funny going around forever there's chance I'm going ""wear mask"" ""keep 2 meters apart"" forever. important things life avoiding getting Covid. already low risk harm vaccination 93% even less risk harm.

I fully capable taking personal responsibility feel ill careful around old/vulnerable people/settings weird psychosis needs end. way live life. end? miserable. mean, it‚Äôs chill, wanna hang tonight hmu got u need exactly able take masks?
When deadly viruses stop mutating appearing - credible
When whole world herd immunity every variant every deadly virus? - never happening 
If wants restore even shred credibility need back pronouncements actual science.  read actually said comment chain, good day way ... 70%+ population fully vaccinated.

Also, we're currently averaging 12,000 cases day (7 day average) ... 7 day average goes back 50,000, 60,000, 70,000, higher range bet restrictions implemented.

Also, look WaPo tracker ... there's early signs spike cases. always weeks behind UK. vaccinated become infected, body able quickly attach antibodies virus virus shed antibodies attached, making less likely cause symptomatic infection others. 1. Yes, certain instances, 79% time, can‚Äôt catch 

2. decided dump irrelevant ‚Äúcredentials‚Äù, hence ego trip comment. We're talking Israel. common cold within next years

This quite optimistic take, one haven‚Äôt seen anywhere else especially among well respected scientific publications. yo source, perhaps expert saying this? already made decision california spite mask mandate lifted 6/15, long delta variant arrived. mostly fake maskless supposedly vaccinated bozos running around. trolls ridiculed, but, usual, proven right. denying people misinformed though okay.  didn‚Äôt wear masks flu before. Covid eradicated would still wear mask flu season?   lmao ego trip must consider person introducing narcissist.

/u/RhubarbTea made comment ""I think means can't catch it""

to replied (paraphrasing) ""no they're 79% effective...your information incorrect"" 

this implies vaccinated people immune infection spread.

Have good day, get enough gaslighting listening roommate talk mom people CAN'T get vaccine got take effect they're immunocompromised. Wtf?!! People like deserve live.  hundreds millions vaccinations. Damn vaccine fantastic.  Youre one comparing food borne illnesses COVID dude. look like idiot Never stopped! Mask effectiveness around 80% higher depending study‚Ä¶ higher vaccines used.

The real vulnerable anti vaccine mask folks, world benefits less point. Lothar Wieler, kind german Fauci said today, vaccinations alone wont able stop next wave autumn, still need simplest measures, like masks. vaccination slighlty behind US likely overtake soon. So, yeah, ill wear mask inside.  Outdoor masking ever required social distancing impossible. suppose bit directed towards organized gatherings; like we're walking around yardsticks, things like obviously hard enforce park something.

Even Murphy refused accept new CDC guidance first, least removed outdoor masking guidance vaccinated people. matter happens indoor masks, see outdoor masks returning shape form.

It's summer, much New Jersey's economy revolves around Jersey Shore. Calling outdoor masks would much hassle. said food borne pathogens transmissible. are, even humans. read comment. don‚Äôt spread readily doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs biological impossible even particular difficult. quick google search Japanese find eye clinic banning vaccinated people. I‚Äôm sharing name clinic don‚Äôt think give traction, doctor seems buy ‚Äúshedding‚Äù myth - claims vaccinated people somehow ‚Äúshed‚Äù spiked protein sweat, breath skin contact, causing negative effects people around them. incorrect, since ‚Äúshedding‚Äù relevant vaccines containing weakened forms viruses, current COVID vaccines not. 

The doctor also seems believe getting COVID vaccine get infected COVID, incorrect. read topic CDC‚Äôs COVID-19 [Myths page (specifically headings ‚ÄúDo COVID-19 vaccines authorized use United States shed release components?‚Äù ‚ÄúCan COVID-19 vaccine make sick COVID-19?‚Äù)

With said - shit risk / reward assessment straight forward. took vaccine day 1 available since less worried potential long term side effect vs. known recorded medium term sideeffects COVID (let alone rolling dice immediate death...). think still valid people may skeptical.

NYT good write various buckets vaccine skeptics. kind interesting majority politically motivated people. honest skeptics, also skeptics overall medical community (this largely racially based due ugly instances throughout American history). 

I agree lot ignoring facts taking stand. deserve get infected. quite valid say 100% non-vaccinated population, whole situation unprecidented therefore may valid anxiety vaccine.

The US alone lost 600k people disease. That‚Äôs equivalent deleting Jackson, Mississippi.

You mentioned *human nature* . Yeah, you‚Äôre right. always idiots assholes, doesn‚Äôt mean shouldn‚Äôt call selfish behavior. I‚Äôve heard Moderna CEO even places lunch order Panera Bread ü•ñ Pfizer CEO.

It‚Äôs rumor though, could placing completely different order menu Panera Bread large. they'd better get vaccine protect shedding lol Well fuck, wonder well data hold true delta variant currently burning across UK seems people getting seriously sick even doses.

Source? real data thus far indicated single positive case fully vaccinated people symptomatic. I've seen one article trending people using evidence seeing high levels vaccinated illness, give sources stacked collective weight peer reviewed evidence date. 

I'm saying impossible, I've seen nothing even remotely compelling make claim. annual revenues around $40+ billion, I'm sure would heartbroken. in: Sharks say fish friends, food. Since vaccinations picked up, sub gotten d0≈çmer-y. Lots reasonable people left sub ""over"" them.

It get worse time even reasonable people leave. contradicted theory bringing vaccines. reason behind apathy vaccinations/fewer deaths. immunocompromised people vaccine less effective for? people yet eligible vaccine? people able get myriad reasons outside control??

And wrong ""mutants come whatever country does""

Do know mutants arise? happen virus replicates. Since can't replicate own, find host. deprive hosts can't replicate. can't replicate mutate. know deprive hosts? vaccinating virtually everyone. That's got rid smallpox.   know soothing reassuring read that. Thanks Ooh that's good one too! heard before! people gotten reinfected COVID mean vaccine would make safer. People get COVID vaccinated well. appear rare events. decline deaths coincides vaccine. course factors play truly believe people enjoyed using way knocking Trump. post unscientific incorrect anyway.

Self correcting problem.  described back half year I‚Äôm trying part! take booster vaccine gradual doses? I‚Äôve read done. Welll, quite. CDC came said mRNA vaccines reduce risk infection [91% fully I'd say that's significant. work college, (actually county) owns buildings/land. We've saving ton money utilities closed areas use.

I've heard talk even repurposing space future lot classes go online only. also Sputnk V seems high efficacy severe side effects associated similar vaccines(AZ J&amp;J).

So definitely useful, like everything else needs optimized use. comment suggests otherwise. decline deaths invalidates theory. Pfizer got hit $2.4 billion dollar settlement 12 years ago. Can't imagine they're keen going again. Well, end part population natural immunity well. Maybe still get herd immunity vaccines + that. 

Also, vaccination rates probably uniform. communities herd immunity, would need restrictions places. national. link supporting purchasing additional office space? Oh I'm aware. Yeah, there's point made presented bar graph vax vs unvax deaths per month. think point made would same. that's passes journalism today.

I'm concerned hints declines seem verge turning around. UK vaccinated case rates steeply climbing seem able anything it. happening them, could happen us. Presumably Delta thing. Eh, much less mismatch flu shots. Like order magnitude understand reply therefore downvote vaccinated protects you

Not anywhere near much vaccinated does. mutants come whatever country does.

Vaccines like seatbelts riding motorcycle helmet. primarily protect individual.   I'm referring resistance families. people cautious scared versus anti-vax. live Missouri know anti-vaxxers here. put political labels want everyone lives life politically. us scared, virus vaccine, that's ok. organization already looking trim consolidate real estate footprint. smart thing do. **average age = unvaccinated.**

NOVEL virus? something body ANTIBODIES PROTECT AGAINST!!!!

90-95% effectiveness fucking amazing vaccine!!! negative!

These vaccines protect severe illness. make severe illness chance less 0.10%!!!

Even one 5%-10% could catch Covid vaccinated body full antibodies stop it. likely soon virus touched nose going congested full mucus like common cold. body's immune system firing stop virus.

If vaccinated there's good chance cold virus spreads throat possibly lungs immune system notices it!!! 

So really saying vaccine 99.9% effective actually care getting immune response stopping severe illness!!! imagine like Yeah, pharmaceutical company would never that. wow. time Delta variant explode cruise ships. ""plague ships"" expected horizon, guess. Doesn‚Äôt sound like 28 February 4 April 2020, consecutively recruited 357 patients positive SARS-CoV-2. Breast milk helps pass vaccine mother kid..

Pfizer/Moderna combo also happy. existing vaccines deployed, clinical data sought carefully planned observational studies, also randomized trials vaccines versus placebo, one vaccine versus another, different vaccination regimens (e.g., different doses, numbers doses, intervals doses).

Who going approve trials, volunteer effective vaccine found?

I don‚Äôt see viable. don‚Äôt take kindly *positive perspectives* around here. Set aside pragmatic assessment incredibly low death numbers embrace blind panic. 

This r/coronavirus way - trust science, unless says leave house. think like reasons people getting first dose. think laziness complacency likely seconds doses. fact one dose providing decent protection delta believe Bill Gates wants depopulate world things he's gonna vaccines? Cause that's people get vaccinated here. Maybe can't. Perhaps find inner peace. comical thing is, bet rate still, like, 97% last two months. probably much lower look April - June. better chance dying car accident way get shot. chances getting low, odds finding someone virtually zero. entire sub summarized:

‚ÄúDelta bad, must reinstate masks all, online schooling, create stronger variant soon, must take precautions even longer. Even asymptomatic cases cause long haulers. vaccine breakthroughs, get worse ‚Äù

BINGO. suspicion. made veiled racist comments. son played ball son. like coach ""favored black players"". Never saw favoritism. Shit like that. yeah definitely least overlaps demographic. problem exposure crew‚Ä¶unless also antivax ship old decommissioned‚Ä¶rapidly sea?  allergic reaction 1st shot. r/coronavirus: *orgasms* Serious question: vaccination never reaches higher levels? Let‚Äôs say introduce incentives, lottery, give stimulus checks, etc. vaccinated people, yet despite effort stalls 65% fully vaccinated.

What do? keep restrictions indefinitely reach what‚Äôs determined immunity? never reach herd immunity, keep restrictions forever?

It‚Äôs something concerns feel always somewhere 30-40% population refuse get vaccinated. that‚Äôs true, do? understand purpose model. Guessing exact number cases virtually impossible, used give idea future trends. in: company going risk multibillion dollar lawsuit saying false information something benign India making billion doses Covax (GAVI) IIRC.

Yes, listen them. Dr Ugur Sahin Biontech said, normally vaccines produced 7 10 years produced vaccine 15 months, long-term effects still unknown.

Thank telling listen doctors, that's exactly did. guess what? Fauci e-mails saying too. believe ""h294824bd"" reddit world wide conspiracy orchestrated pharmaceutical industry entire scientific community literally every country.

Well, American Court system disagrees you. watch ""The Pharmacist"" documentary Netflix see doctors got sentenced 40 years jail. Lmaoooo. conspiracy, they're jail. might wanna visit so-called doctors behind bars.

We never lockdown Florida partied up. way, never wore mask too. Guess what? Locked-down California death covid average per person Florida.

I guess masks lock-down really work well Cali.

Never wore mask, never stayed home, never got vaccine. I'm still alive, bro. worries.

We achieve herd immunity 70% population vaccinated, natural herd immunity virus deadly strategy, Brazil one since beggining pandemic nothing changed even arrivals vaccines masks, self isolation, lockdowns, mass testing ""useless"", federal government. high deaths numbers months non stop year proof that's strategy genocidal. assure greatly, vaccine coverage younger demographics Norway least 90%. big interest getting vaccine, very, anti-vaxxers.  72-82% vaccination rate bad... smh.

I‚Äôm 43. big health issues (perhaps mild asthma certainly eczema/skin stuff.) daughter son (13 11) also positive Covid sick again, presenting flu type virus. obviously vaccines ages probably helping. feeling rubbish times daughter lost taste. daughter caught classmate school (the school already told isolate person) one one got it. also huge percent population young yet vaccinated. I'm pretty sure Astrazeneca safer every drug currently use treat things like cancer interesting. think heard before. interesting see happens. Basically remaining want MRNA, want J&amp;J shot. Aver Novavax, US anything else close approval? absolutely ridiculous Israel still around 40% pop unvaccinated. cases rising Look dates article. data set Dec 7, 2020 June 7 2021. Vaccines made available December, takes \~6 weeks first shot reach full immunity. So, reasonable think vaccinated people fully vaccinated. think data would look much different used April-June data, since much larger vaccinated population then.

But still, 0.2% still good news. Yes, roughly 40% remain unvaccinated still substantial amount Kind skewed number. Even vaccine ‚Äúavailable‚Äù available lot. many dead would gotten it. study needs surplus people clearly choosing get it. system unable provide it. getting doses EU. getting doses manufacturers. agreed join EU‚Äôs purchasing order collectively could get doses shipped Europe lower cost per dose.

The original comment stating Norway slower vaccinate US EU sending doses countries. However; EU vaccine exports irrelevant EU control doses Norway receives, separate doses EU receives, even orders placed together. 

Additionally, Norway bound buy EU joint procurement program. bought doses Covax, separate joint procurement program EU, sent less developed countries. happened, expressly made clear Norway could claim doses chose to, instead choosing to.

The biggest reason slow rollout date Norway ‚Äî like much Europe ‚Äî planned use AstraZeneca primary vaccine. vaccine encountered problems, Norway switched Pfizer Moderna vaccines back order months due large part USA buying many vaccines earlier on.  pathetic 80 ages 50 64 represented significantly larger share deaths recently. May, quarter deaths occurred age group, compared 16% total deaths throughout pandemic.

Adults 40 still teeny-tiny number deaths now, 2x used 3%.

To me, deaths large medical bills result. mention feeling like crap months. Time move Scandinavia. Yes I'd assume antibodies. Perhaps strong vaccine immune system would primed someone prior infection vaccine. Hopefully means causes less issues them. Thanks :) mind asking age? guess 40. Also health issues? think caught it? Thanks hospitalization rate unvaccinated people? old were..or pre-existing health issues Deaths remain extremely low UK last week started vaccinating 18-24 year olds 5.5 million vaccinated, almost 60% whole country. target US 70% freedom, countries handled better can‚Äôt get without reverting‚Ä¶so know, mathematics says it‚Äôs got precaution, given low example outdoor transmissions are, talking masks again.

Would anyone accept playing one million Russian roulette baby? No? hell would let someone touch baby without vaccinated?  that's good hear  yeah, vaccines thing, awesome preventing death. data article cites also 2020 number likely much higher, closer 3 million deaths. article published March pre-approval trial conducted last year.

Real use data published PHE shows AZ Pfizer vaccines 80% effective preventing infections.

You deliberately spreading lies misinformation. can't help people want help themselves. county 20% vaccination. Even though man 30s recently died covid (totally avoidable death point) percentage changed. Authorities loudly announcing everyone currently hospitalized unvaccinated. Still change. people would rather cover ears scream lalala change minds. Two weeks soon. Someone dies due Covid-19 likely infected two weeks prior. Serious question (not unless area):

What fraction, many, population fall category can't get vaccinated? know definitely some, strip religious ""personal"" reasons medical, what's look like?

Looking rabbithole right now, would love hear expert chime in. otherwise zero idea refuse even speculate. wears mask inside crowded public places, right? have, quite recently. point going return normal. People act like covid dissappear vaccines never case. entire idea reduce serious illness hospitalization, we've achieved vaccinations. weird people think need take steps back careful. realize eventually things like masks social distancing go away.

clickbait  would anybody bother public clinics? Sounds like cons pros. Ok... second shot Sunday, eight weeks. could‚Äôve gotten sooner I‚Äôve busy newborn. [A control group.

That leads sorts errors efficacy rate, applying alpha variant age filters delta virus even though might different. 

Another HUGE issue mix passive protection vaccines direct protection vaccines. 2 doses centered around really old people, virus spreading there. virus spreading there, can't compare resistance vs. People exposed it. Keep mind vaccines permanent. main goal vaccine pushes provide safety vaccinated. quash spread virus point longer serious threat vaccine still offers protections.

If there's evidence virus still spreading, worse increasing spread, take additional precautions try quash virus vaccines still effective. Even means asking vaccinated people/asymptomatic people wear masks indoors again. Keep child safe! understand people either. I've shots continue wear mask, hard. Good luck you! And? Yeah, burn two half days PTO get shots could get full weekend's rest. know side effects going kick vaccine location far drive lunch break. Unfortunately day supposed go get shot ended getting covid gave antibody cocktail I've wait 3 months actually get vaccinations. get one week, us shity luck see problem here......  got second shot March, think over. Somewhere, mutation pop completely bypasses existing immunity, start again. I'll get booster shot soon available too, remain masked public places strategy called Prime boost vaccination mix match Vaccines COVID-19. Remember works viruses tried Coronavirus Yeah 100% correct, person said lots things completely wrong. Wish people would research they're actually talking type it. people aren‚Äôt really waiting, haven‚Äôt gotten it. full approval, expect employer make mandatory. it‚Äôs stalling to. certainly aren‚Äôt treating like quarantine are. 

I hope approval comes soon!    SARS CoV2 infection considered COVID-19 case symptoms. mean, good everyone? Idiots die rest us get rid virus. see problem. Ps: people use word woke sound dumb. Matt Gaetz? sure get many downvote, maybe people bit denial.

I totally this, Delta variant may big issue now. troubling whether virus keeps evolving rate, eventually develop immunity towards vaccines. see endemic covid would bigger threat endemic disease, another list. Given unbelievably effective vaccines would actually make case endemic covid less threatening endemic influenza, certainly less EBV. weeks dose 2 would‚Äôve meant probably experienced secondary wave side effects. happened people (me included Moderna).

Ps you‚Äôre woke downvoting critical discussion. issues? Another little thing that's big deal whole vaccine fiasco masks now. 

So city many businesses putting signs saying fully vaxxed need wear mask inside. fine dandy ke except that's trusting people word since place going ask vaccination card anything, dont think would fully support anyway... sure seems like slippery slope dont fully understand.

My point though many businesses optics wearing mask vaccinated yet, deal me. epileptic also years ago go chemo well. I've told even though years chemo heavy damage immune system takes many years recover from. I'm sure know epileptic seizures fuck body, seizure meds caused immune system absolutley tank since started taking like 3 years ago. started meds never sick reguarly life (33 years old). last year different me, sick contagion year, fucking amazing! masks know it, hell wasnt even good washing hands reguarly I'm forgetful idiot thanks seizures meds (like real major memory problems) always wore mask.

So SoCal city live basically vaxxed everyone, except crazy republicans, people cant get vaxxed. people like wearing mask definite improvement medical life... look like every idiot store refuses get vaccinated.

It doesnt really affect life doesnt bother much. sucks taking extra precautions medical needs causing look like... I'll nice say, makes look like giant fucking moron part 5g gang.

I really hope overall eventually normalizes wearing masks. I'm quickly places already losing wonderful 6 feet got everyone else line. socially awkward self really loved close people public. stand front scooter (epileptics allowed drivers license, E-Scooters time me) line keep people breathing neck, even still get people asking ""do mind?"" motion move scooter. say ""no"" turn back around. 2021. gonna line covid sniffing golden retrievers everywhere get tested everywhere also amazing mood golden retrievers everywhere? living Japan last month. watched briefings live.

That's 2 yen. Using stats start year almost nobody vaccinated pandemic absolute peak justify saying Covid deadlier year... disgusting fucking fear-mongering title. answer question nothing stopping rising, models suggest future peak ~20% last year's peak threaten hospital capacity. arrest someone murder without evidence? Yeah, would completely illegal. That's someone charged within 48 hours arrest released.   really? mean I'm going doubt information getting year last year seem prominent news cycle, aka, I'm simply hearing it.

I assumed rue though because... lol. We're America, change, capitalize letters. People get used idea covid away. Even reach global herd immunity (which happen) mean cases drop zero. Covid become endemic, question much covid willing allow normality return. even U.S., article talking worldwide.

The stats U.S. waaaaay better last year.

For intents purposes, *is* here. Anyone U.S. wants vaccine get now. Anyone refuses implicitly accepts ths risk. 45k cases yesterday? Lol make things what? Simple thought experiment. Assume population 11 people, 1 unvaccinated, 10 vaccinated, get exposed. Assume Pfizer prevents 90% 10 people symptoms/being detected/etc etc.

The result 2 people detected disease: 1 unvaccinated &amp; 1 vaccinated. IE 50% cases fully vaccinated people.

In experiment, 10/11 \~91% vaccinated, similar claimed vaccination rates Israel.

The math seems reasonable. (for literature, look Bayes) said Israelis, say ""the ultra-orthodox subset Israelis"". testament Israelis country able beat virus support allow strict orthodox religions abide beliefs too. Everyone sacrifice bit make possible. really going hurt anti vax movement live abroad music expat ears. frustrating hell kept vaccination drive despite huge surplus. hysteria arrest someone suspicion murder?

Mask small price pay middle pandemic. expected continue wearing one state less 30 Covid patients total hospital moment big deal. 30 total even month without mask rules. now? Places US throwing vaccines. Take advantage. ""Virtually never"" ""never."" even die often, person gets infected another chance variant evolve spread. also get ""long haul"" symptoms complications many adult covid survivors get. wouldn‚Äôt worry it. said done bet 60% delta number that‚Äôs loosely tossed around J&amp;J going low side fared well South African Brazilian variants phase III trial. needs booster road they‚Äôll make known. article trash.

Would interesting see courts handled that. thought 60% contagion 90+++% hospitalization death??? concentration antibodies breastmilk increases mature milk 1 year+ benefits still there. correct good immunity baby vaccinated directly immunity breastmilk passive immunity would still provide some. mean, supply limiting factor EU countries using AZ doses would've helped, would marginal. AstraZeneca's supply issues meant huge impact even doses used. Pfizer/BioNTech main supplier EU, far. unable complete full regimen child bc first shot didnt well mother didnt get 2nd. Going talk primary next time go masking go away?

It's norm many Asian countries decades wear mask think might sick. Maybe trouble there, people start get vaccinated? I‚Äôm home. I‚Äôm working home. stay home. enjoy life.  like cult breaks heart.¬† 

It *is* cult. Seriously, name one thing Trumpism would disqualify cult. article say US deaths 2021 exceeded US deaths 2020... talking global deaths.

And course concerns spread disease countries, reason pretend like pandemic still raging town, clearly I'm vaccinated. There‚Äôs large compound patches long time now. It‚Äôs literally needle industry lobbying them. cdc fda aren‚Äôt pretending it‚Äôs perfect. They‚Äôre actively reviewing data link rare cases pericarditis/myocarditis. Mlem!! point, Delta contagious.

Taking old precautions may effective, although one saying directly, yet.

Even precautions effective, tho, full vaccination Pfizer almost completely protects hospitalization death. I'm still wearing mask even 2 months fully vaccinated, worry getting sick, weird kind show solidarity towards whole concept taking precautions.  cases mild? goal make Covid disease minimal morbidity/long term symptoms. cannot eliminate death -its impossible. main disadvantage welfare state, everything available everyone, waiting lists get longer. small price pay ensure everyone gets need. went Universal day people pre covid. Where‚Äôs dead?

Calm down. brave.   I've never seen definitively accurate answer question posed reddit thread. want cherry pick, cherry pick, cherry pick way ""come down"" (as say Price Right) rosy picture things. Why? Americans cherry pick. Trump newest, great leader cherry picking. problem cherry picking. Here, actually generalize: *it's cherry picking. Get get everything. Fail get risk losing everything.* discussion fast spreading, certainly be.

And long-COVID issues take weeks months show up, even person non-symptomatic infected. sure hope so. see illogical title, nice. 100,000 covid deaths happened january 0 covid deaths happened September, people September would justified deciding problem over, even though yearly death toll high. News needs move on, point even fearmongering generating clicks anymore public moved on. brother one those. passes get shot tell it.....we finally gave Xans drug ass get shot... too! fully vaccinated still wear mask. Fuck anti-vaxxers graves. selfish prideful they'd rather put families harm's way, wrong admit stupidity. enough vaccines 3rd world country. Sighh course means 0.8% deaths people vaccinations. know one dose? two doses? causes covid made worse died? curious what's causing covid deaths vaccinated people? Why‚Äôd add coconut? miss original. That's UK encouraging everyone get second dose.  Bulgaria AstraZeneca? There's lot back forth news articles one, understand confusion.   say, would thought? healthy infants died C19.  Almost 24 (healthy) died coronavirus. :: big breath in::

DUUUUUUHHHHHHH  sad fact lot world still spreading don‚Äôt access vaccines, yet US get free vaccine less day people simply refuse. bunch dummies  great lmao care mean, there's British study currently. We'll see turns vaccines, people stupid get causing problem. Same. covid beginning I've cough ever since. easily get fatigued. Didnt release numbers said cases lower they‚Äôve since start? Sadly blame vaccines‚Ä¶ Got uncle cancer. can‚Äôt get vaccine. coordinating efforts get hesitant, full antivaxxers, vaccinated. driving production overseas vaccination, since live bubble.

Getting immunity hard way mutations occur Can't pop Sweden Germany claim living need immunized? Except unvaccinated people choosing so. immunocompromised can't get vaxxed. problem, can't forget they'll end suffering people get vaxxed won't. mean, yeah?

With global pandemic, continued spread virus countries poses significant threat everyone. acts reservoir virus; gives opportunity mutate become virulent.

We, developed countries, possess infrastructure transport store mRNA-based vaccines. Even facilities rural areas, lack ultra-cold storage capabilities, able keep mRNA vaccines time due updated storage guidelines. US, also abundant supply vaccines. Quite simply, issue demand. 

Supply plentiful many developed countries, developing nations lack infrastructure cold storage quick distribution. It, then, makes sense global pandemic perspective, well foreign policy perspective, export excess resources necessary.

Another possible factor consider uncertainty present whether booster shots necessary future. becomes apparent necessary, may well efficient logistical perspective - - 3 types vaccine boosters available country. Adding 4th vaccine adds logistical complexity scenario. So, call 2nd generation vaccine. Still, rest vaccines might get 2nd version soon including mRNA ones. advantages.

But good. generation vaccines better better.
Hoping next generation see one dose vaccine get people faster. Maybe? preliminary data showing 50 less likely get likely. mean Spanish Flu infectious younger crowd. Ignorance bliss.  Add verbs like ""slams"", ""blasts"", etc headlines outrage clickbait, motherlode modern journalism.   eligible people. slowdown specific groups result states reaching 70% level. won‚Äôt. adopt next sweet sounding excuse originally heard it. Ffs, people couldn‚Äôt care less FDA says, shoving sorts foreign bought meds alternative meds, they‚Äôre experts emergency approval vs full approval?

It‚Äôs movable goal post we‚Äôre pretending keystone. everyone 12yo? named 1 dose vaccine name like ""Laika"" ""Soyuz"", calling Lite. *feels safer,* doesn‚Äôt matter science? goal slow spread hopefully slow rate mutations. 

How half country refuses get vaccinated circumstances?

Lift restrictions let get immunity hard way. we‚Äôre waiting anti-vaxxers get vaccinated lifting restrictions mask mandates, we‚Äôre going waiting forever. still virus. Almost cases vaccinated people asymptomatic  also shown cause life long health issues children cases multi system inflammation. actually killed aunt 50s six weeks old. got really bad flu cause heart become inflamed died. 

But covid happens children part body like heart, lungs, gastro, even eyes. don't. like thinking critically relies feelings. None covidiots expect die it. Hmmmm. Sounds like bullshit. numbers breakthrough cases? (I mean actual gross numbers, panicky ‚Äú200% increase‚Äù CNN nonsense) - hard numbers. many vaccinated people hospitalized due covid? nice? looks like main concern people 1 shot vaccations. 33% effective delta w/one coronavirus variants, Delta variant could pose greatest risk vaccinated people. Research suggests better able break people who've one dose two-dose vaccines, Pfizer Monday, Mike Ryan, executive director World Health Organization's health-emergencies program, said Delta variant could ""be lethal efficient way transmits doses vaccines appear protective Delta. considerate response. Need people behave like you. evidence shows vaccines work, know would convince people... Decreasing efficacy good sign talking mutations. way create quick immunity. goal slow spread hopefully slow rate mutations. takes one break significant way.

Less hosts, less mutations. would ideal achieve vaccination. It‚Äôs complicated 5g loons actively trying recruit others making loony. want kids vaccinated. Then, go back licking handrails. vaccinations. many people dying ‚Äúpoor‚Äù countries America many dying covid. cycle would argue herd immunity infections vaccines are.

Why wasnt India blasted 2020 like US was? Vaccines didnt exist 2020, tf getting credit? one shocked guess showed us numbers preventing long covid vaccination? Delta variant far breakthrough cases. saying folks paranoid, still plan keep level social distancing strangers can, continue mask/n95 high risk areas public transportation planes. honestly feel comfortable removing mask know others around vaccinated. Sounds reasonable. suing release data, change policy. fact, scientists chime safety issues theaters. mean‚Ä¶ long haul needs time long haul‚Ä¶ tricks keeping nose? 2 year old willing wear his, always either slips nose high pokes eyes. I've tried different masks it. heck  worried anti-vax parents (65M 59F)? say fully vaccinated? article says vaccinated. Obviously would make huge difference scrolling faces covid twitter account saw someone died 30s turned vaccinated afraid needles viewed covid flu. understand afraid needles, experience felt almost nothing times. made mad ""just flu"" reason. literally died hill need on. Personal choice guess. that‚Äôs calculate total vaccinations people must death wish society. Possibly vaccinated people one increasing breakthrough infections. also less transmission means lower risk even worse variants. Ya don‚Äôt say! us understand science also understand changes new information.

A large portion pf country understand science thinks immutable. treat science like another religion. sure know, covid dangerous babies. UK took path extra caution. data changed.

Everything delta still holds true sadly folks know catch it‚Ä¶ even many still deny President Trump scapegoat? That's right even makes sense.  covid last year natural immunity, need shot. Thanks anyway. father step mother went path every visit grandpa's ends lecture drive home understand reality works. former CEO Moderna says Kariko mentor Penn get noble prize means anything. Like little strawberry jam pots get buffet breakfast? title imply time ago vaccinated people dieing mostly unvaccinated? Yeah, kind unnecessary point. Damn, [Israel going backwards worried. I'm fully vaccinated live US, things *finally* looking up, I've read news starting feel like we'll *never* this. Ugh. surprising. pretty obvious vaccination works. Rolling stone magazine? one still available shit low percentage? big government tell businesses cannot    Youtube goddamn cesspool. Always been.  That's argument keep parents. keep citing 99.5% survival rate, keep saying there's huge difference surviving recovering. Let's say survive shot 8 times, I'm paralyzed neck down, colostomy bag, brain damage, survive recover? turns 16 year old self thought parents idiots totally right. Really? I‚Äôve never flu shot one ever pressured get one. Assuming true. We're lied constantly. last variant tested vaccines Delta. know already detected Epsilon, Zeta, Eta, Theta, Iota, ... 10 15 variants beyond Delta. far over, and, likely, continue annual like flu.

Life finds way. father two girls 50% diapers, also guilty above, I'm going gently protest opposite:

My wife enjoys cutting grass girls know use power tools.

This team sport. Joe Rogan told us Yep. way going reason poor kid grows develop next shingles post-polio syndrome. went cigarettes. asked posted source. made honest mistake it‚Äôs good saying .8% vaccinated still DYING ? Ok vaccines BS ! Displacement imply number fitness advantages. I‚Äôve done research exactly point. side effects consistent normal immune response created body - fever, lethargy, aches, etc. relatively mild people, many people experience all. may slightly unpleasant, dangerous real infection damaging organs like covid infection could. Please worry get vaccine! Myself, wife, friends family vaccinated nobody issues. Billy Madison great movie, tell specifically think incorrect? people seriously reading fucking quotes sectionÔºü

""73 people confirmed **died** testing positive variant""

Edit: Ah, never mind, people commented edit. Somehow ignorant fact vaccinated people dieting Delta variant. totally correct, flu vaccine beat current flu vaccine passed phase 3 trials. moving toward authorization likely also produce Covid/Flu combo shot future.

They've working Coronaviruses long time little interest funding now. made strong case early get warp speed money, research lab manufacturer, definitely behind curve production capability.

The ""new"" adjuvant use tested trials well really adverse effects reported, there's that. still believe ‚Äúvery scant evidence B.1.617 transmissible B.1.1.7‚Äù despite fact B.1.617 completely displaced B.1.1.7 UK accounts 98% sequenced cases there, resulting first rise cases UK seen since early January? (Same pattern seen Russia, btw).

Hmm, remarkable definition ‚Äúvery scant‚Äù. think strange sort denial here. Another issue immunosuppressants immunocompromised may mount response vaccine even suppressed immune system might fight virus. may dangerous also may much help you.

A large part design vaccines making sure body strong enough response lasting memory. response strong enough vaccine may last short time give long term memory all. likewise even vaccinated fully healthy later go immunosuppressants may able fight infection.

I'm fully vaccinated, still mask up, keep masking probably summer 2022 become reason someone ends disabled something might years even decades road something caught kid. Previously infected people develops protection virus, known long. However, like vaccines protection 100% breakthrough cases, shows infection + one dose get significantly better protection compared protection infection.

I seen studies protection infection vs protection vaccines, hard compare.  stopped Target today long drive kids (14 4). 3 us one employee ones saw wearing masks. People staring us like idiots. 

My wife, myself, 14 year old fully vaccinated. Obviously 4 year old not. She‚Äôs signed pre-k August I‚Äôm honestly still sick stomach it. talked doctor said hasn‚Äôt seen rise cases problems since local school district state lifted mask requirements schools. Plus careful we‚Äôve since pandemic started much we‚Äôve sacrificed stay safe, 4 year old understanding knowledgeable staying safe possible. 

I know statistically speaking advantage, doesn‚Äôt negate concerns apathy negligence others around kid. Gotten tired hearing phrase uttered sarcasm. good, long. Probably media done poor job showing damage plague really doing. 73 people died Delta variant. expect infected order end dead disease. also can‚Äôt verify, believe article doesn‚Äôt define ‚Äúvaccinated‚Äù one shot verses 2 shots, may confound data want cytokine storm. see advantage disadvantage supply chain is. x shots available per day people want it. guess welfare state shots likely go likely fucked first, instead willing pay. Exactly. Less people dying every day bad flu season. Immunecompromised history anaphylaxis specifically flu shot vaccines here. Pfizer, went epi pens case, side affect times sore arm. shocked including doctor - still could possible safely get it. give flu vaccines immuno-compromised time? Also AZ currently predominant covid vaccine Australia immune suppression contraindication either. 

You might thinking ‚Äòlive‚Äô vaccines yellow fever dangerous immune suppressed. Vaccines effective allowed get vaccine (under 12, immune issues, bad reactions previous vaccines, etc). I've idea downvoted. I'm india swept whole country, still grappling it, though bad Apr/may. know fully vaccinated guy 40s got covid succumbed it. quite healthy known ailments. reminds men used enter ladies-only event World Series Poker couldn‚Äôt legally forbid men entering tournament, WSOP responded making entrance fee $10,000 (up $1,000), gave women 90% discount. best defense coronavirus-laced aerosols well-placed bullets.

High dose de-wormer isn‚Äôt gonna fix viral respiratory disease. see anything going backwards. Maybe historically careful states, irony vaccination rates high likelihood surges slim. happens sub Corona becomes irrelevant? Especially imported Norway. read? clearly said Florida passed law banning companies banning unvaccinated. instead outright banning them, goal make unfeasible unvaccinated cruise. course, move also inspire political backlash anti-vaxxers instead encouraged jump hoops make statement. cruise ship. worst thing industry's recovery would COVID-19 outbreak ship right now. Discouraging unvaccinated great business plan. want ship vaccinated. cool, 11 pregnancies (only 2 babies) ago. Miscarriage happens.  I'm sure saying. girlfriends mom excuse plenty opportunity excuse auto immune disorder? Flu vaccine grown eggs. covid vaccine not. allergic eggs? like needle phobics? I've vaccinated. Republicans stupid vaccinate themselves, let die. Sorry, sorry-- they've killed many asshattery care. ""I understand rich countries vaccinating people!"" ...Cause tax dollars government used purchase vaccine first place probably benefit people paid it? Either reshape world disabled people still live damn besides poverty relying charity others live, we're *awful* times even COVID stops issue. Florida governor Texas governor enacting legislation ban vaccine passports.

First paragraph article
""politicians Florida done exact opposite banning private businesses requiring guests provide proof they‚Äôre vaccinated."" Hot air balloons. Things could change, certainly, facts say right vaccines seems handling every variation COVID thrown them. None things happened within city limits Kansas City, live. Thanks mayor tough enough right things. rest state, particularly rural areas, mercy horrible governor, would right things. Congrats boundaries committed friends! training cosmetology school 99% cops. embarrassing.

You think cops training cosmetology poster? Ivermectin wanted to. governor Florida allow that. could either stop sailing Florida altogether, this. compare one other. Everything relative, nothing exists vacuum ""Everyone social media saying poison""

...hey, want remind you...social media different depending sites think like. Nobody--not single person know real life, follow social media--has said vaccine poison, scary way. Nobody.

Now, hang around real life, like social media, sites think like. 

If social media full fear, think absolutely sucks you. horrible situation you. 

But older line work friends professors doctors scientists engineers lawyers executives blah blah. we're vaccinated we're fine. 

You fine too. Royal Caribbean charging outlandish prices making uncomfortable unvaccinated ones cruise. ban unvaccinated cruising? asking trouble, FL, par course... I‚Äôm fucking sorry!! Finally someone describe experience. tried telling dr yesterday said typical. didn‚Äôt feel typical. Never headaches like linger, almost like pain itch inside skull. 

And I‚Äôve perpetually tired. Dog got days body didn‚Äôt connect brain said run. 

Also strange back pain internal pain episode days went ER for, felt similar get gall bladder out. scans nothing. Said muscle skeletal. 

Still glad got shots, man, didn‚Äôt expect that. Los time friends/coworkers COVID didn‚Äôt get chance vaccine. I'm saying doses, encounter it, get something booster, even get full booster worth. want judge based ""public health whole"", also need factor effects lockdowns: Lower quality life, worse mental health, less exercise, less social interaction, weight gain etc. Covid also far first thing risk causing long-term effects.

Lockdowns made sense hospitals overrun people died large numbers, make sense already vaccinated large portion population (esp. vulnerable).

We cannot shut whole society people may develop symptoms still get covid, even though vaccinated. People shots still dying dividing though? Well statistically sample size entire exercise completely meaningless. end mandate children vaccinated. Funny enough got 2nd Pfizer dose today rewarded Grand Big Mac. know right, way news outlets discussing variants feel like never get pandemic. Mask life get line every single vaccine company. It‚Äôs true way. gets me. two kids choose vaccinated. worrying people matter most, children? Media, Government, Idiot Celebrities, blah blah blah. Missourian here. Yes, relieved fully vaccinated living Kansas City. Drive outside KC, you‚Äôll find many unvaccinated folks, including family believe everything church tells them, won‚Äôt get vaccine. I‚Äôm relieved myself, terrified others. This! heck time getting friends families get tdap vaccine babies born 3 yrs ago. folks met kids yet, since many people fought us also refusing Covid.  point either vaccinated not. let virus create job openings.  would make extra money then? really necessary? TY posting yes Good. physically medically able vaccinated done now, deserve kind treatment, sympathy get sick die. Don‚Äôt trust science?? We're boat 3 year old. brother wife refusing vaccinate. argument vaccination status affect us. Yet knows son gets seizures complications even simple cold.

The self-centredness boggles mind. math works.

First, herd immunity Delta variant somewhere around 80-85%. Second, 80-85% vaccinated immune, rest get covid (milder symptomatic asymptomatic) infectious. achieve herd immunity vaccine alone would require close 100% vaccinated.  cdc needs host lotteries every state 50 million. state reaches 80% vaccination rate lotto starts. Everyone vaccinated gets put lotto dad said exactly ans brought herd immunity isn‚Äôt effect yet, don‚Äôt enough vaccinated people, said well don‚Äôt know vaccine dangerous not?????? virus pretty damn dangerous  ok must satire, one dumb many times consecutively.

planes much safer cars, vaccine wildly safer covid. anyone mask vaccination pandemic pants head idiotic. know two people infected COVID beginning pandemic said bad them. got JNJ worried virus worried travel quarantine rules. Two weeks later, vacationing. county, 75% eligible people fully vaccinated. think we‚Äôre pretty safe now.  agree 100%, I‚Äôm one saying can‚Äôt get flu get flu shot. better chance getting hospitalized getting covid vaccine. 100% worth it. It‚Äôs smart person changes position something faced new information. quite fascinating people anti vaxx tend use 'we know long term effects' excuse lot also put children greater risk catching covid ... also know long term effects of. also covers anyone worked lockdown areas (which includes CBD) past two weeks. covers pretty large proportion city‚Äôs population. I‚Äôm curious keep hearing Novavax compared ‚Äúthe similar‚Äù traditional flu shot. tried looking info, I‚Äôm super great wording things right way. explain similar? That‚Äôs question curious about!
Thanks! Well, one greater cleavage ability. Less replication errors, coronavirus greater proofreading efficiency, faster switching pre post fusion spike confirmations. Need go on? huge amount things. None things mentioned necessarily leads greater presence virus respiratory tract secretions. could basically everyone vaccinated said yes  I‚Äôm worried seeing go college international university 3-4 digit number students coming directly India. That‚Äôs reason husband waiting Novavax too! It‚Äôs definitely understandable! Nobody thinks country.  I'm worried fast thing end. another fucking entire year thing end? earth thing over. Yeah think varies drastically depending age preexisting conditions doctor would able fully determine Totally agree! post challenge opinion science (again, agree), challenge potentially (and believe unintentionally) deceptive use skewed life expectancy data. kinda pedantic equitable analogy

It's analogy lol. I'm pointing reasoning behind kid wearing mask dumb lol. Saying, ""Wearing mask easy risk mitigation tactic, we'll continue that"" one thing. thing criticized line take ""hard pass"" putting kid situation there's one million chance could die. guarantee time.

Do want. literally could care less. even know you. made public comment weird line reasoning, commented it. You‚Äôd think would, seeing people vaccinated J J probably gonna first ones need mixing. Okay, 36% deaths many, many fewer hospitalizations. 

Either A) vaccine making covid really bad select people B) people still susceptible severe covid vaccination

The UK primarily vulnerable people double dose. people incapable immune response. definitely appears case here. life? r/Qanoncasualties thousands us. Fox ""News"" Tucker Carlson got mother, future in-laws even worse OAN (this one worse, promise you). never forgive parties, know sounds stagnant, self-realization presenting facts issues actively hurting causing middle lower class problems, hearing racism, bigotry, homophobia, general heartlessness insensitivity, disregarding human beings white Americans, years older adult, I'm sorry, critical thinking skills want anything them. best influence brainwash anyone else, right time instill good people, people perpetuate hate around child, one.

You either nod see happens call out. Yes decreased infant mortality result of‚Ä¶..science!  understand we're still masked protect since Delta variant hitting kids harder they're saying Delta variant, may infect 6 people. Nice balls, RC! didn‚Äôt say dead, getting vaccinated still get sick COVID consequences you, it‚Äôs normal Covid low risk children, worried aspect?

A low risk what, exactly? Death? know that. death I'm worried continued *spread*, resulting death serious illness older people *tail end chain* reason let kids links along chain.

This worried 12 months ago, ""long COVID"" sequelae well understood. Got shot 2 yesterday. Aches today I'm happy hell. covid shows real, boys gonna ready beat s*** it. insane? vaccinated immune systems everywhere throwing shade ""like anything right"". ""The vaccine rollout race"" -- Scott Morrison. No, think absolutely nothing whilst watching cases rise dumb idea. We're going go another lock down, lose lives, lose economically.. Correct I‚Äôm wrong actual chance vaccinated person catching delta variant would better 12% 20% 88% efficacy vaccine.

http://www.livescience.com/amp/covid-19-vaccine-efficacy-explained.html

‚ÄúOne common misunderstanding 95% efficacy means Pfizer clinical trial, 5% vaccinated people got COVID. that's true; actual percentage vaccinated people Pfizer (and Moderna) trials got COVID-19 hundred times less that: 0.04%.‚Äù example fitness advantage would result displacement variants entail neither increased transmissibility increased immune evasion? mechanism would allow variant displace variants would involve neither two characteristics? put C19 LHC ""see happens"" get demogorgons yeah, science... think post may Canadian thing ever. ‚ÄúHow dare media congratulate Canadian accomplished something!‚Äù. No, israel's decision based science deathbed before? see. Thanks heads üëç I‚Äôll reserve sympathy immunocompromised can‚Äôt vaccinated vaccine effects aren‚Äôt strong result. also reserve heartfelt sympathy poor souls contracted horrible illness even shot taking vaccine. People world still dying lack vaccine people won‚Äôt take it. It‚Äôs disgustingly sad. friend's parents anti-vax got chicken pox years ago 20's, miserable taking oat baths, missed work awhile, scars face it. Can't stand anti-vaxers, exactly Covid around mutate indefinitely. Don‚Äôt forget children. Vaccines don‚Äôt prevent transmission. Don‚Äôt stop taking precautions even encouraged unless aren‚Äôt putting kids risk Adults. WELL... lifted mask mandates told people vacinated go back regularly scheduled programs. mean care MUCH safety! ...SURLY tell us things safe!...right...?? üòè  asked Sweden imposed restrictions. answer yes. moved goalposts like answer.

Edit: apologies linguistically exclusive language, think really drives point home. Oh antivaxxer protected class now? Hey Republicans, want remain alive fight radical Democrat agenda?

Better get vax! Hell yeah! Florida: Based State believe you. know me.  

Do think anything Covid good? Makes Melvin :/ literally *can't* ban unvaccinated passengers cruise ships. Florida made new law making illegal businesses refuse unvaccinated customers. cruise lines want keep sailing Florida, work around new law. would run much political backlash, wonder would really happen. One reason vaccine. Another reason bc many people US smart educated enough know better. One reason vaccine. Another reason bc many people US smart educated enough know better. still worried people refuse get vaccinated? worried myself?

Other people refusing get vaccinated increases risk getting sick, implying worried yourself. 

That's whole point publicly funding vaccination, promoting external benefit someone getting vaccinated, individuals lesser risk. individuals refuse get vaccinated, bad sign something. decide get ""worried"" problem completely you, course. Lol....shocking....fuckin' Florida....  Unfortunately includes 11 under, well immune compromised. old enough take directly putting children immune compromised unnecessary risk. :(  I'm going die sure shit going stuck inside ungrateful ass children Ah, this. wish couldn‚Äôt relate I‚Äôm dude, real odd self centered way phrase sure. say person doesn‚Äôt really give damn people online think I‚Äôm friendless introvert real life choice, gain nothing ‚Äúperformative‚Äù opinions.

But modern America, narcissism rule exception  He's saying vaccine half effective compare one variant another, vaccinated all. vaccine still effective worth taking chances negative outcome (infection) doubled compared previous variants.

But kids. boomer mother anti-vax heard someone heard someone else who's friends son pharmacist way could came vaccine quickly, would normally take years develop. 

She tried persuade getting jab. Mind you, 61 years old 105 pounds. frail high risk group due poor health/age refuses get vaccine. shitshow, it‚Äôs fatality rate insanely low, everyone doesn‚Äôt feel fear virtue getting back work. rest cling virus much want, rest us get back making country operate.

I wonder actually spending money make misleading message prominent. we're going split hairs here: rare cases prevent getting Covid (breakthrough infection), certainly prevents suffering severe symptoms leading ""long-Covid,"" hospitalization, death. Canada get second shot mRNA, got AstraZeneca. Oh, sorry. article clarify implied misunderstanding, work clear Pfizer Moderna defined case least one symptom (however mild) positive COVID-19 test. Johnson &amp; Johnson defined ""case"" positive COVID-19 test plus least one moderate symptom (such shortness breath, abnormal blood oxygen levels abnormal respiratory rate) least two milder symptoms (such fever, cough, fatigue, headache, nausea). Someone moderate case COVID-19 definition could either mildly affected incapacitated feel pretty sick weeks.

This confusion explained article. efficacy number relative control group many people got *the disease*? X% less control. latter number absolute fraction people got disease. Neither figure says anything asymptomatic infection. 

I'll leave comment as-is, though relevant parent article. pulled kid state school blind (a k-12 special needs school many students mutiple disabilities, include compromised immune systems) refusing provide remote option next year longer enforcing masks social distancing.

Who said that?

This article says one dose enough covid, different needing vaccine also stated every person get vaccine.

Which pretty good precaution sure groups need (two) doses. Better vaccinate many may even pose risk young people.

Every approved vaccine benefits outweighs risks. extremely rare side effects exist vaccines, covid still pose much larger really blame me?

They really need start looking hospitalizations deaths, rather cases. UK Israel certainly test cases much cases-to-hospitalizations ratio evolved. You‚Äôre right mutations spike protein change vaccine efficacy. AFAIK big variants mutation spike protein. example, ‚Äúdelta plus‚Äù variant K417N mutation, meaning 417th amino acid original spike lysine changed arginine. point mutation changes shape protein slightly, depending person‚Äôs immune system, might even antigenic region (ie antibodies normally bind protein target). course, also can‚Äôt incorporate many changes function spike protein might damaged.

Governing bodies can't deal unknown uncertainty, dismissed ignored outside immediate reality, like health officials. That's fine, act like getting COVID even vaccine ""no big deal."" significantly less big deal death/hospitalization table, still end long-term issues (as far personal risk goes). want risk that, cool. make sure also looking can't take vaccine whatever reason (not talking refusing think conspiracy whatever). example, wearing mask going shopping would still prudent protect others. vaccine mean can't transmit COVID system far know.

Therefore somebody vaccinated got infected chances already higher risk factor people younger 30 especially younger 20.

**Pfizer VS delta variant:**

After 1 shot: \~ 33% symptoms

After 2 shots: \~88% symptoms 

After 2 shots: \~96% hospitalisation

**AZ VS delta variant:** 

After 1 shot: \~ 33% symptoms 

After 2 shots: **At least 60%** symptoms (AZ takes little longer providing peak immunity; around 28-35 days) 

After 2 shots: \~92% hospitalisation (Again, may higher people gain peak immunity)

Covid unvaccinated populations bad vaccinated populations probably worse Flu, data UK proves it, there's large rise cases rise deaths hospitalizations insignificant.  Thanks, added it.

I concerned possibility variant partially evades vaccines. think that's less risk vaccines target spike protein virus uses infect human cells. spike protein mutates much, might able infect humans. Yep, predicted dominate strain 2-3 weeks. Highly vaccinated areas though impacted.  I'm looking chart World Data. way posting interactive -- create several steps. I'll describe see.

It's daily new cases per million people last two months three countries:

UK cases took late May climbing sharply ever since.

Israel cases bent upwards 4 days ago climbing quite sharply.

US cases dropped sharply June 4 levelled off. last couple days they're barely increasing.

Now note UK Israel vaccinated are...and happening them. Presumably Delta thing. Delta US doubling every week two. Sure seems likely we're going respond like have. know wouldn't. anti-vaxxers everyone give fuel. Absolutely correct. Everyone needs opportunity vaccinated. families. like last year. Who‚Äôd guessed that? I'm fully vaccinated completely fine everything. I'm saying people talked concerned want concerned that's fine. throw report report face positives still personal beliefs vaccine virus. Everyone Reddit quick jump anyone different belief comes vaccine virus, that's fine well. comment disprove science, made comment hopes getting others understand people get vaccine purely political reasons. individuals sit Reddit read study study engulfed anti-vaxx bullshit like think are. applaud many getting facts straight. Hello Mr feet fire, need decision. shit show example Carlin's ""if pre-born fine, pre-school fucked."" unacceptable hang kids dry like this. feel like I'm crazytown. irresponsible condone masking anymore; result obvious. assure CDC would saying old people fully vaccinated go hanging groups indoors without masks 12% chance they'd hospitalized catch covid.

You correct, way 20%. 

Like said, check it, honestly running number checked either. 

According this: current rate hospitalization people 75 - 84 0.32% peak 8.92% January.

And link sent March 2020 start pandemic lot known virus effects different populations. 60% efficacy talking reducing chances catch covid

As said elsewhere... often seen efficacy vaccines touted around terms severe illness hospitalization. link provided source make benchmark clear, asked source clarify this. received response anyone. source clarifies numbers I'd interested looking it.  generally takes around 4-5 weeks time first infection get sick, get hospitalized, die, officially recorded. 
 
What percentage population fully vaccinated early April (so death gets recorded May), meaning got fist dose late January? that's people caught COVID immediately ""fully vaccinated."" people heart problems vaccine?? don‚Äôt mean bad way. want get vaccinated side effects scary. Apollo-11, Apollo program failed land man moon bring back.

Before Wright Brothers, attempts flying machine failed.

What calling failure, steps needed develop new technology. Even affect fully vaccinated individuals, main metric look many hospitalized/dead cases distributed vaccinated not.

I think Israel far enough curve see yet. surge might end case emphasizes importance vaccines turns dying unvaccinated. Delta pro max 2 plus Gotta enjoy eating restaurants, drinking bars, smiling people can... know someone undergoing chemo bone marrow treatments. 

She can't get vaccine right now, get vaccines treatment eventually ends wiping immune system's memory. Active Darwinism.  vaccine created temporary relief you, seems quite possible appropriate treatments could also help allergies. also used suffer allergies sucks. folks feel resigned nothing work them, don‚Äôt give hope. End suffering now!

I mean, assuming good health coverage. Tell socially distance protect themselves. likely US respond like Israel. Individual states set restrictions lift them. several states already passed laws trying prevent future mask mandates lockdowns. Particularly South. Well that‚Äôs shame. Could distributed elsewhere earlier. Probably worried bad side effects able show job next day. rare comparison, low levels actual prevalence, false positives actually *higher* absolute number false negatives. 

Let's say false positive rate 0.5% false negative rate 20%. imagine group 100k people actual prevalence 1% - 1000 cases. test everyone, effect false positive actually larger false negative:

For false positive, get 0.5% 99,000 actually negative, 495 false positives.

For false negatives, get 20% actual 1,000 positives, 200 false negatives.

In all, end 1295 positive results, even though actual prevalence 1000 positive infected individuals. lower prevalence 1% (which case Israel), impact even higher. False positives likely explain good portion they're seeing. mean? immune system work, perhaps saying. less effective may leave open getting variants. first injection simply hard work? immune system always preposterously good, like virtually never get sick, even though little avoid situations likely. agree hassle part understand lot people inconvenience. Mostly travel plans, desire done it, remaining fully vaccinated longer time etc.

Also comparing 2 doses Pfizer 1 dose single dose vaccine. Percentages lot closer dose dose   Delta Sigma Gama. I'm straight good time starting wonder rest lives, constantly glued screen assessing caseloads. Delta ++ Evolution.... uh... finds way give indication baseline lift mask mandate, leave place indefinitely? 60 percent fully vaccinated Israel? seeing around 57 percent look up. personal beliefs vaccine virus

Personal beliefs invalid. basis form ""beliefs""? Belief word use unprovable imaginary things. Scientists draw conclusions facts. two-bit ""belief"" enters end result.  vaccine makes like - worst - like got flu. 

However, flu still kill people significant health problems, especially elderly. 

Plus sample size bad (should April people vaccines) someone ELI5 vaccines expire? components expire happens then? confirmed yet though according report recently read. isnt enough data yet know vaccination isnt preventing spread. could wrong, cite sources cant remeber read statement morning. UC system California announced everyone must vaccinated. Officer workers, faculty students, etc. Everyone. 

Which helps events (and safety them) agree completely. Misinformation responsible kidnapping plot Michigan, Capitol Storming January 6th. Based study, zero.

Truth is- seemingly (close to) sterilizing immunity wane time, fine. antibodies wane, memory cells shoukd ready curbstomp virus invades body.

What mean? time passes, vaccinated people become infected. Sounds crappy, right? hold - there's good news! memory cells beat utter crap virus swiftly, vaccinated peolpe get infected- likely wont suffer sever diseasr virus wont shed much fight infection quicker. positive affect transmissiom.

So, people start freaking vaccinated start catching COVID more. expected. bodies primed beat hell it.

I see much difference anyone spreading virus regardless vaccination choices. Spreading virus spreading virus. Turkish friend got first dose :)

Also people hospitalized unvaccinated. fair, born anywhere automatically enrolls death lottery. Another point want add vaccination isnt homogenous within country. bubbles want vaccine get (yet), young people living poor countries.

Furthermore covids gonna become endemic, means stay, everyone doesnt vaccinate become infected. misconception 70% vaccinated 30% safe. No, catch covid. That's pretty big statement evidence. asymptomatic vaccinated, known viral load carrying significantly less not, would also infers (and shown many studies) low chance infection anyone else. urban poor die unvaccinated similar levels dumb Republicans. say vaccinated Republican agrees - hope disenfranchise voters quicker voters die too! doesn‚Äôt mean anything broad sense.

COVID probably first mRNA vaccine ever widely distributed. types vaccines tested years never mass distributed populations. Yeah, US, 45% population fully vaccinated, is, 55% population much different year ago. nowhere near enough provide kind herd immunity, especially highly contagious variant. 

What's happening individual people saying ""I'm vaccinated, pandemic me."" strange view things. one.

The moment started vaccinating people without sort central database, ship sailed true verification. Whether anyone likes not, there's zero way reliably determine whether everyone vaccinated (that say, individuals could verified state level, there's system verify everyone). I'm sorry complete overreaction!! So? still spread Delta variant even they're asymptomatic? husband NYS fully Pfizer vaccinated. mask mandates lifted SOE ended. 3 month old home...so looks like we'll masking public long Delta showing may infect 50% double vaxxed persons. Crazy.

And asymptomatic Delta infected still transmit disease...then leaves unvaccinated people's risk exposure. Children immunocompromised people alike. It‚Äôs reasonable question ask. There‚Äôs nothing wrong getting clarification.  Cases, hospitalizations deaths drop United States week week. wearing masks isn‚Äôt vaccinated. It‚Äôs aren‚Äôt. people can‚Äôt get vaccine medical reasons. 12 kids aren‚Äôt approved. Trying stop spread really nasty variant COVID. Idiots, I‚Äôve two shots wifi never better, chipped like dog makes travel breeze! /s trust WHO? ones said nothing worry China first discovered this? Apparently so. Honestly barely heard term mRNA day received first Pfizer shot week ago. like win. Even contract disease (not 90% reduced chance, 90% reduced circumstances would 100% chance catching unvaccinated) still much lower viral load thus greatly reduced ability actually transmit. I've seen studies estimate 90% reduction transmission, top 90% reduction ability actually contact first place live society act like it.

Don't get wrong, got shot ASAP lets blow things proportion shall we?  Yep. Totally agree. even young kids wearing masks anymore city since mask mandates lifted.

It‚Äôs get ugly, quick. Sorry ship sailed.   Look today's data UK. portion population vaccinated US. cases doubled last week, pure exponential growth. .2% vaccinated people die covid. .2% unvaccinated people die covid.

Pretty pathetic performance, overall. Well know certainty original virus asymptomatic transmission, really know vaccine. see, guidelines changed, get illness vaccine get covid test unless severe, gonna large hole data. say definitively one way another arrogant. means companies probably cease work home. people still spread others

Source?  Yeah, there's different types! Pfizer Moderna make two popular mRNA COVID vaccines. Brand new stuff.

Other manufacturers may use traditional ""weakened"" ""modified"" strain vaccines. Others may use new-age ""nano particle"" systems.

They work different mechanisms operation-- far ones highest efficacy variants seem mRNA vaccines. really well still. According [this 15th June using Public Health England data:

We discussing diseases spread, whether possibility community transmission exists vaccinated people, clearly true. Vastly diminished unvaccinated, precluded, originally claimed again.

In context recommending public health policy globe, vaccine rollout completely different region region (let alone country country), recommending publicly people pretend spread can't happen vaccinated dangerous. get political since Cuomo re-election year, neither state particularly emergency situation right now, think Cuomo likely gonna go first.

Murphy lose Cuomo. probably make us asymptomatic

This incorrect. Pfizer and, IIRC, Moderna vaccines greatly reduce infections/spreading vaccinated. least variants investigated before.

However, yet seen data Delta. contaminated food found gets recalled. cant humans. hell talking about? Aaaannnnd there‚Äôs goalpost. Bit harsh agree sentiment. Effectively ending mask mandates mistake.

A study 2018 US death certificates found 2 8 comorbidities listed. 20. comorbidities listed death certificate unusual indication top listed cause death actual/most significant.

Many States specifically list COVID separately reporting ""it's bad""-ers harping it.

See post thread 122.9% death rate 2020. gets pretty hard come non-COVID explanation deaths, every attempt I've seen (deaths despair! untreated conditions!) explain 2-3% almost 23% increase. actually saw massive decrease 200,000 vaccinations today, might data abnormality. Maybe states mandates impose mask mandates cases increase significantly. wonder states mask mandates higher vaccination rates need mandates reimposed. Guess need wait see like everything else.

I wish another way get people vaccinated, shouldn‚Äôt challenging 600,000 plus Americans dead. everyone. depends R value. transmissible variant, immunity takes stop spread. 

[If reproduction number original strain around 2.4-2.6, one Alpha 3.6-4.2, Delta 5.6-6.7. layman terms, person infected original strain could infect nearly two people, person Alpha variant could infect four people. Delta, one person could infect nearly seven people. R 2.5, threshold herd immunity 60%, R 6, 83%. Jesus Christ people mask. many anti-maskers now. one outside Australia(which already pretty strict honestly) locking down. highly doubt US implement mask mandates anyway, states making illegal mandated, hell states never mandate, would states rise likely happen anyway. 

I mean realize still wear masks public transits like planes go doctor/hospital right? Like seriously, understand people whining this. Even CDC said possible masks may come back localized areas.

Source? something wrong evidence.

56% people Israel double vaccinated, studies shown Pfizer vaccine, exclusively used Israel, prevents 79% Delta covid infections compared non vaccinated people (and 88% symptomatic Delta covid cases). 

We expect less 10% Delta infected people vaccinated based data, somehow there's report 50% cases Israel fully vaccinated people. best guess sample heavily favored vaccinated people, travelers something like that.

Also, fact 100% fully vaccinated people asymptomatic makes sense based data have. Im aware *communicable* disease is.

Food borne pathogens pathogenic. also spread oral fecal route digestive secretions. they‚Äôre main mode transmission human human, still transmissible diseases. Stay germ box, like people don‚Äôt mind spitting other.  CDC gave finger people first rescinded mask advice, need clean sweep leadership.

This pandemic really demonstrated need new leadership West institutions governments exceptions. Fully vaccinated people infected spread virus others even asymptomatic. transmission rate relatively low original strains fully vaccinated.

The concern Israeli situation transmission rate may higher Delta strain. US difficult determine US record asymptomatic infections fully vaccinated people. believe Singapore recently reported many breakthrough cases fully vaccinated people infected others. nice website illustrated, cannot find moment. think right India (where Delta started first place).

thx definite drop 18-29 year olds, still giving first doses. Hopefully keep increasing next slide 4 There's evidence percent rate severe cases going up, total number, would make sense given delta variant transmissible infecting total number people begin with.

Now old people ones vaccinated, would huge cause concern high transmission rate variants + high hospitalization rate old people bad combination hospitals. got symptoms starting night. felt bit crummy next day could still work fine. federal government responsible oxygen supply Delhi, full state legislature ruled opposition party. 12 states divert oxygen time crisis due low level politics And?

CDC know can, unless everyone vaccinated still continues follow guidelines, virus still spread. There's still chance someone who's vaccinated could go work give someone vaccinated. What's difference vaccinated people spreading non-vaccinated people spreading it? I'd willing bet money many fully vaccinated still following guidelines wearing mask public. Yeah, still little misleading, include holiday deaths talking about.

I checked [historical CDC curiosity. Using numbers early April (April 1, 2021) 17% entire US population fully vaccinated. 17% represent .8% deaths pretty huge.

Also important keep mind 17% entire population. know COVID related deaths adults, adult vaccination rate would even higher. Hmmm, surprise! Israel 26 seriously covid patients hospital across whole country. amounts roughly 4 people vaccinated seriously ill.

Kind important piece context left bud 

The amount misinformation thread ridiculous  many anti-vaxxers think. Close 90% adult population vaccinated. Israeli Ultra-Orthodox seem less anti-vaxx diaspora groups. Yes, certain centers. see, epidemics rise broad flat distribution like tide. start isolated spots become problem spread throughout wider community. Every state ran ICU beds OG Covid started one medical center ran beds. another another...  point reference, according cdc data, approximately 2,000 new COVID hospital admissions around 300 deaths PER DAY (7 day moving average). sounds like vaccines quite well. correct, known deaths due meteorite. Dr. Chin-Hong must including dinosaurs statistics. Wait people dying fully vaccinated? thought messaging one died fully vaccinated. Canada (where almost shots MRNA pfizer leading way) we've Delta since least beginning month, province, Alberta, 5% cases 1st, today 20%, seen vertical spike Israel seen yet. cases #'s positivity rates continue tumble Alberta/Ontario/Quebec.

It's quite strange see whats happening compared experience far, maybe we're lucky, maybe unlucky found pocket could spread really easily.  aren‚Äôt mods removing comments misinformation? There‚Äôs loads false information thread. employee shots still got Covid 3 months later. Fairly sick hospital. He‚Äôs 40. also: ‚ÄúIn U.K., Public Health England released report found 26 73 deaths caused delta variant occurred fully vaccinated people June 8 June 14.‚Äù  Bad analogy - lottery people.

Giving percentage deaths/etc without percentage vaccinated useless. 1 100 people die vaccinated would amazing 90% (or even 50%) people fully vaccinated. would terrible 1% population fully vaccinated.

Thank good know certain set symptoms vaccine, would pattern actual virus would affected you? Minus sore shoulder course. Delta not, cases likely going go slightly prolonged period dropping.

i saw article talked 7% hospitalization rate among fully vaccinated people sinovac india wondered baseline was.  recently announced Pfizer vaccine could stored warmer temps.

I think worth adding part Pfizer able get vaccine approved rapidly. concerned demonstrating worked spending months figuring highest temperature could reasonably kept at. think made right call because, despite logistical challenges storing vaccine -80 C, able start getting people immunized much faster. Correct. parent, everyone really, needs information decide risks want take. I'm pretty sure responsible hospital bills. join? wonder many people enough allergic reaction first dose advised get second. last study saw estimated little less 20% average. 40% one pre-existing condition less 9% didn't. Older people likely pre-existing condition thus likely hospitalized.

I'm sure they've redone numbers wake delta variant. Apparently American scientists China detecting limiting outbreaks animal viruses contracted humans September 2019, Trump cancelled funding sent home claiming work waste money. 

Oops. areas yeah... areas 70% vaccination great living here.  Except wear one, impacting emergency services limited could used elsewhere. vaccinated protects you. protects entire country mutants arising could render vaccines ineffective bring us back square one. 

So vaccines like speed limits also seat belts.   simple. keep spreading around allowing mutate. going affect us eventually. cases people denying COVID real even died it.

It's like concerned salad year ago responsible food poisoning today. makes absolutely zero sense. Covid: Enters body

Your immune cells holding crowbars: Well well well. here? wrong.

November literally impossible lying. Nobody US given vaccines November. could prevented easy way /s gets noticeable problem, it‚Äôs late act

""Too late act"" implies there's sense acting. People noticed acting. wasting time? People stupid lazy. good news we'll enough data determine whether second dose really vital. ‚Äúvaccine hesitant‚Äù lmfao disgusting businesses never expect heartless. Don‚Äôt forget substantial undercount daily cases Florida‚Äôs substantial daily numbers excluded now. kind went ""hoax virus!""

From article  may gotten already mild even asymptomatic case. What's verdict protection severe disease delta variant one dose vaccines? understand protection infection \~33 % serious illness? protection still good one shot? wont let us without quarantine open them? Unless trial, didn't.

The FDA grant EUA mid-December. downvoted this? Yes! problem know people have.  going vary greatly. college requires vaccines unless pursue religious medical exemption, obviously couple anti-vaxers do, almost everyone get it. True. We‚Äôve elderly people US die even though fully vaccinated. Well nephew lives north fulton county originally lied 70 + yo cancer surviving Dad vaccinated. constantly posting month trump 4/2021 March, trump 3/2021 February etc. works restaurant number unvaccinated people rarely wore mask. he‚Äôs gotten far beyond me. word J&amp;J vis Delta?

6. Spread amongst unvaccinated increases chance another variant popping might evade vaccine even delta variant does.  That's even close true. live age misinformation. know right? done right thing already likely lost cause late stage. Oh ones easy. Political influencers propaganda networks make bread stirring pot, spreading conspiracy theories disinformation half population, pretty stupid susceptible. profitable fuck people/companies ethical standards. money. So, side effect, vaccines improve human gene pool? Nice. False propaganda bullsht.

Sorry easy science hard you.  L.A. county though? live CA. yes, contracted COVID unit. November first shot December 2nd. Sorry news pick know tell you!

Maybe I'm wrong I'll double check. \~15% current seriously ill patients vaccinated (no details given whether fully vaccinated not). 
 
Source: much conversation, Texan would scream ""That's socialism"" fully vaccinated two weeks second shot (or one shot got J&amp;J) go live life... never going safer right now, barring development even efficacious vaccine. much herd immunity waiting for. covid vaccine produced 15 months

How long take produce Pfizer's vaccine? trying make vaccine corona since 2010? Lol. Tell me, long took?

Do believe believe Dr. Ugur Sahin found covid19 vaccine first biontech? Long-term effects unknown since world lockdown. enough time produce test vaccine like diseases.

Generally, vaccines produced 7 10 years. Covid vaccine produced 1,5 years. That's exact reason, know long-term may survive, still maimed still pass others die

Yes, saw compared Florida vs California, death per person mortality. never locked Cali yet, Cali death per person Florida.

Forget covid. chance dying disease %0,03. aint get none vaccines. We're likely die American cop shooting us covid anyhow. see Americans anything stop 250 years.

We're used taking chances. know enough keep masks on. know blind spot, use caution. That's interesting. believe based discrepancy hospitalized vaccinated extremely risk. Go worldometers. Compare daily news cases daily new deaths curves compared January, 2020 surge nearly identical. April/May surge appears world charts completely non-existent US charts. fact, US charts, daily new cases deaths much lower April, 2020.

Anyone would look charts conclude pretty much US. Nearly half US population vaccinated. kind cherry picked data unhelpful. likely deaths 70+ group. group 95% vaccinated UK. unvaccinated 5% causing 64% deaths. lot countries vaccination open ages though hit hesitancy wall. Whereas Ireland, Spain Nordics getting 30-39 group. used Relative Risk Reduction Absolute Yes, type people need protect getting everyone else vaccinated. It‚Äôs reassuring least large US city hospital at, least far who‚Äôve ICU extra factors. None passed away either. reassured effectiveness vaccine least. know time tell. feel you! Sounds like inlaws. Good relationship covid hit joined crazy train. refuse vaccinate won‚Äôt let around grandkids (who young get vaccinated). won‚Äôt even put mask around us. Yet, blame us say it‚Äôs decisions caused rift family. It‚Äôs infuriating really. Sucks. hope feel better soon. sure vaccinated since, reports people getting long Covid relief vaccination. I‚Äôm sure heard same, it‚Äôs worth mentioning. mean information quoted article? one credibility? Sounds like anti vaxx bs. thought worked lmao I'm NY live Mexico city. Went home get vaccinated stayed 2 months. end trip nyc returning back normal really low case loads. nice street, mask, worrying. came back mexico city, everything open (mostly), government botching response vaccinations, gf vaxed yet live dense area. wear mask I'm getting together random people. really want risk small chance infecting gf family they're vaccinated. vaccinated September here, we're going states getting done. still could've exported doses outside EU territory though, least countries supply.  Incorrect, small pox eliminated, bubonic plague stopped sanitation Spanish flu evolved less lethal too. oncologist's biggest concern vaccine work well immune system mount big response. thing mixing math language million different ways express data using words. 

Let explain: Let‚Äôs say 100 vaxxed 11 nonvaxxed people, 10 people group (20 total) get covid. 50% got covid vaccinated (10/20), but, time, vaccine 90% effective (90/100 vaxxed people get covid.)

In short, need include analyze much data infer meaning numbers. ‚Äú50%‚Äù meaningless without bigger picture. Never mentioned US got J&amp;J. literature gave either. Ok flu deadlier them, no? Like Covid deaths among pediatrics super rare probably WAY danger car. Deadlier year US? think not. Americans relaxing America gots shit control now. suppose stay home there‚Äôs mass cases continents? People still acting like COVID huge deal US brainwashed people think never problem all. Iowa

According weather app 23rd (most recent day currently processed) whole 33 new cases 3 deaths statewide. insanely slow boil like weeks now. would love kid vaccinated. 12 yet. Low risk? Sure. Annoying *all* precautions dropped south? Yep. Yeah wife got zip second. Took day work everything. might time I'm glad 2 teens  suprising 8% fully self absorbed that. many Americans obsessed instant gratification sacrifice greater good. think previous waves much effect it. Nordics lowest hesitancy best performers western world outside Australia New Zealand. Bulgaria third highest death rate EU, really Bulgarians feeling urge get vaccinated. There‚Äôs also allergies vaccine components, hair stylist can‚Äôt get one Moderna Pfizer use propylene glycol, allergy acquired job, allergist tested see could J&amp;J reacted too. Novavax might option her, it‚Äôs available right now. Norway isn‚Äôt socialist country Tell get J&amp;J then. he‚Äôs US choice. Maybe use psychology make think he‚Äôs proving wrong get mRNA one. end it‚Äôll keep spreading illness around can. UK got similar figures too! Pretty much 95%+ uptake everyone 60.

Currently 65% population overall, we've still got long younger people work through. think we'll probably get 72-75%, struggle get higher open vaccinations 12-17 year olds. 

Which still pretty good. Israel 64% seem progressing much. USA 54% anyone wants get it, think. it‚Äôs not. Same, almost every anecdote I've read, seemed sick people 80+. Hopefully don‚Äôt choice Japan also vaccine skeptics hear. efficacy Pfizer unquestioned. new delta variant drops effectiveness roughly 10% still impressive \~80% efficacy Pfizer. far better vaccine fares delta. Tokyo nothing. quite lot.  

Please look briefings amazing Governor there:   

She leader fighting Covid trying keep people safe Tokyo, even fighting Japanese national government enough.   

She taking time due fatigue:   often worked weekends late night coronavirus measures holding meetings senior officials...  media reported Koike hospitalized.  

She hero saved lives expense health. sure mRNA definitely future vaccines would say mRNA ones arguably extraordinary due lives tech save long term assume it‚Äôs avoid risk food poisoning, haven‚Äôt heard recommendation before. Uh, vaccinated pussies cowering corner. idea long-term effects virus are, even initial mild infection. honestly really don‚Äôt know long-term effects many viruses. much learn. Also kind ignoring pandemic basically far local affairs everyday life within US we're around 11,000 new cases less 200 deaths (which mostly among unvaccinated) day. 

The globally higher numbers largely unvaccinated countries like India massive new waves Israel 56% people fully vaccinated. Post bunch links conspiracy YouTube videos.  Nonsense. Positive cases among vaccinated minuscule zero evidence lead variants.

Wearing masks issues countries like taking birth control sister sexually active üòÇ Yep. still mask needed!  Never really looked way. Cdc. live south. extremely accurate. probably enough avoid really bad autumn wave though, since takes six weeks fully vaccinate someone. That‚Äôs fair. become sick seeing others Facebook Twitter dehumanize children they‚Äôre living, breathing human beings. I‚Äôve seen way many people (not directed you) talk kids gross ‚Äúblame‚Äù spreading X, Y, Z variant. Kids suffered lot pandemic. let step soapbox. issue heart inflammation mRNA doses use stockpiled J&amp;J vaccines instead? Yes. Bottom line, need suppress new cases. could mean going back indoor masking. It‚Äôs hard connect dots here. Vaccines work obviously it‚Äôs immediate perfect solution, mostly due anti-vaccine attitudes. Many things cause that. much caffeine, enough sleep, anxiety. ruled types causes? Maybe return post-normal. averse change immediately want revert know? hybrid future could even better give chance. packed work offices constant business travel. 

There could happy hybrid post-pandemic. could live life, even better before, packed like sardines can. wait longer? Doubt you‚Äôd get lot compliance US, lot fence vaxxers caved claim part getting vaccine never wear one again. Bottom line, vaccines working. Get them. Yes majority people vaccinated. creates least bias. sort rebuttals always ignore cost benefit analysis. Wearing scuba suit shower great cost can‚Äôt get clean, it‚Äôs expensive, lot work. Masks little cost. Same! doctor recommended J&amp;J, got later many.  hasn‚Äôt Covid case area government locked borders. Eventually borders going reopen, you‚Äôll either vaccinated reliant herd immunity protect you. part add herd immunity protect can‚Äôt get vaccinated. Act like member 50 cent army every thread know viruses apart Covid? Vincent Racaniello admitted wrong claim variants infectious? love TWiV adamantly claiming case regarding Alpha variant raising eyebrows. pandemics end population starts living them. If, absurd obsession reaching 0 cases, keep restrictions lockdowns postpone inevitable destroy people's lives coming years Yeah still wear mask anywhere feel like can't get good distance people. Target good thrift stores... nope. crowded.

I went without bookstore could drink latte swerved avoid aisles people guess I'm still paranoid. make sense given Pfizer vaccine shown 88% effective symptomatic cases fully vaccinated people... something adding up. submission linking huffpost.com automatically removed source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

I'm ranting. Majority Japanese public want Olympics happen coronavirus resolved LOL. think must oddball. 95% chance preventing people getting Covid. mean, around 50 million Americans age 12 cannot get vaccinated even (or parents) otherwise would want to. That's 15% population right there.  Exactly seems like good excuse spend time them. many people gotten vaccinated vulnerable year last year. Guess fill bowls drool faces watch Tv Zombies like Fox? far know vaccinated good matter are. works like say probably getting covid slim chance mild. 

No reason vaccinated people live scared. Never heard tech. Sounds pretty awesome removed BLAME PRESIDENT counter every TV broadcast soon Biden inaugurated. mean they're directly comparing vaccinated vs unvaccinated populations... think eleigible CAN'T get vaccinated. 


The problem immunocompromised get vaccinated, develop strong enough immune response offers enough protection. people chemotherapy others taking meds suppress immune system organ transplant recipients. estimated 4% population, small insignificant.

Israel UK two interesting cases follow coming weeks since closest reaching mark. Thats said. 


Also, anecdotally... miscarriages. 

One co-workers miscarried COVID. 3 previous healthy pregnancies. Officially ONGYN say COVID cause ""because there's way tell"". like refuse accept reality live reality Loki true God president. feel like underrated comment - vaccinated not, people, majority, care anymore. Unvaccinated probably cared little start, vaccinated assume they've done best can, everyone ready move on. I'm you. rheumatologist suggested extra caution especially get tapered prednisone. I'm seeing people know, vaccinated, small groups indoors without masks. Outdoors distance, mask. Strangers indoors, essential (like medical visit) mask.

I non-confirmable grapevine knowledge working tests show level immunity, research well vaccines working people immunosuppressed immune disorder.

It'll get better. Stay safe. I‚Äôve heard Europe amazing terms working culture. I‚Äôm jealous. nasal vaccines promising. able something injected vaccines can‚Äôt really do: produce sinus antibodies. evidence vaccinated people wearing masks stop spread?  Yeah fully understand, really makes sense there‚Äôs problem work remotely. always thought American people would prefer working efficiently (at least Japanese do) guess that‚Äôs stereotypical. basically reasons. basically everyone care vaccinated, that's do.

Covid cases area live way around 20 give take per day area around 6 million people. That's low enough even vaccinated would extremely worried. 

And lastly part things back normal. go basically anywhere want mask long vaccinated. travel plans understand covid still back normal me. 

There anything really make rest world get vaccinated much quicker. Corollary: can‚Äôt anything it. None us general public can. worry it? R0 6, delta would need 100% * ( 1 - 1/6) = 83.33% vaccinated + recovered get tipping point herd immunity.

With R0 3, original would need 100% * (1 -1/3) = 66.66% vaccinated + recovered get tipping point.

It turns recovered people *still* need single shot get immunity levels 2 shots Pfizer Moderna vaccines give never COVID-19, complicated simplest formulas show.  least clearly reported 2 separate numbers.  Eh.. there's point even places something. Yup! Congressional Dish podcast episode Long COVID... made *so happy* see it! important scary thing - yet media seems completely ignored year!  lack relevance anyone‚Äôs life close me. It‚Äôs almost like it‚Äôs blown proportion. rubs like new age religion. need last Infiniti Stone you‚Äôre basically invincible people really hate needles want one dose. used Helsinki airport I‚Äôm sure still use.[Helsinki airport idea Novavax plucky underdog going big boys really true. took Warp Speed money, previously taken vaccines full phase 3 programs - failed.

Yes, Curevac shows execute mRNA well. goes established technologies, messed too, like viral vectors (AZ) Novavax's previous attempts subunit vaccines. get point ( age child, luckily visitors vaccinated) flu seems deadlier children, that‚Äôs stance actually worried flu stance (even though flu vaccine less effective). words, didn‚Äôt raise stink flu, may need Covid (but that‚Äôs accurate I‚Äôm sure asymptomatic flu carriers?). either case support decision think getting vaccinated stupid! Bingo.  I‚Äôm expert, assume so. However I‚Äôve read it‚Äôs likely population develops immunity time stops issue can't wait 2 years use vaccine pandemic

Hence need ""fast-track"" giving EUA.

I disagreeing normal makes perfect sense situation. understand even though ""FDA-approved"" yet still went rigorous testing well proven safe effective. know say emergency authorization mass vaccination campaign FDA approval fast-tracking.

To clear, I'm trying sow distrust vaccines way. fully trust vaccines results. fact vaccines developed quickly obviously amazing thing undoubtably saved many lives. fact developed quickly, understand people see reason weary they're familiar this. makes sense someone could nervous seeing ""emergency authorization"" ""not FDA approved"". good news vaccination rates tend trend pro lockdown people, going happen lockdown friendly places low rates.  Actually does, since Covid airborne people wearing masks Israel likely vaccinated. Anyone know heart risk also tied COVID? I‚Äôm mid 20s male, covid month ago, get vaccine next week. point risking already immune? Covid reinfection seems extremely rare. Also good know traveling. Lots places still requiring tests entry/return....good know risks since one stuck test positive. willing tacitly say, ok, willing let many people die every day get lives?  Critical reading much better friend google. Neither studies whether Ivermectin works. 

The first retrospective (aka fully uncontrolled) study nearly year ago found positive correlation, suggesting research done.

The second n=76 study using Ivermectin prophylactic. shows positive results, study size low draw conclusions. Note using IVM prophylaxis much different using treatment. /r/thatsthejoke Well, large numbers people really start die, they're going lock stuff areas. everyone lives there's problem. lot humans 12 years old people medical issues can't vaccinated. hold little longer try stop Delta variant spreading, wearing masks bit longer, we? even dramatic sacrifice. grew hearing stories actual war, mask freaking nothing Hey least they‚Äôre typing Zune wife's nurse, we've agreed neurological. Sense smell? Breathing *function*? Brain fog? Yea problems brain. might *affect* lungs, start insane. friends living near Tokyo believe heard them. ask twice though must misunderstood. fooled 60% number. I'm mistaken, reference 60% effective completely preventing covid symptoms whatsoever. believe effectiveness preventing severe covid/death still greater 90% J&amp;J vaccine. studies demonstrating efficacy vaccines. troll? I've staunch supporter measures control spread, still find disagreeing lot sentiments thread.

Covid low risk children, worried aspect? continued *spread*, resulting death serious illness older people *tail end chain* reason let kids links along chain.

We debate whether right let non-pharmaceutical measures adults want get vaccinated ample opportunity. say ""Let 'er rip"", others say ""wait kids get vaccines *so elderly/vulnerable even better chance*"", believe incredibly negligible risk under-17s. COVID widespread January February... favorite fathers get side-eye glares called pedos places alone kids. 

There's far much ingrained gender biases everywhere. Yes, symptom one day. decreased progressively day day. don‚Äôt die immediately ample time spread virus. Unvaccinated people help virus spread rapidly, mutate frequently. leads faster path vaccine-resistant strains. 2020, could pass staying-inside-out-of-shape. can't say year later, multiple exhausting shorter hikes several weekends. appears new normal lungs handle. Anyone 12 can't. That's huge portion population typically yet developed good hygiene. This. much this. Ah yes, Wall-E solution, like it. virus miraculously went away heat Easter. need HQC! able medical leave unless test done public clinic (hospital). tell school / company positive test ignored (even several people proximity dept/class test positive) . even try alert people possible positive take preventive action.

This think data could represent cases. checked positivity rate, high, would prove point. Children barely affected covid all. 3 weeks long separated doses trials, trials showed worked. really simple. ""Nothing Pierce titanium veins! He's grown resistant needles.""  average, far potential growth cases concerned, US vaccinations COVID-19-delta worse last year without vaccinations.

You'll see sized spikes end summer masking social distancing reinstituted.

Fewer deaths hospitalizations, number new cases.

Israel instituted new precautions vaccination rate 56.7% fully vaccinated another 10% partially vaccinated, much better USA:

[Israel Reinstate Indoor Mask Mandate Next Week COVID Delta Variant  currently blaming viral shedding vaccinated people. allow us aid blue arrows. Same. avoid indoors much possible mask go in, unless home depot something enormous ceilings plenty space shoppers. Food still either take-out, delivery outdoor seating. child takes every preventative measure possible scenarios mentioned. knows swim taking lessons since could walk, still use 2 layers spring loaded gates unable reach open.

He also allowed drive unsafe drivers, uses seat belt car seat.

I believe taking every reasonable precaution, exposing unnecessary risk. Every adult interacts covid vaccine, else wearing masks. logic, things exactly them.

Also maybe next time edit original post try sound like making rational point, without stating edit... guess people get vaccinated they're concerned long term effects still discovered. 

Exactly. like long term affects still discovered get vaccine. That's right.

Normally, covid, needed approximately 10 years come vaccines. know long term effects vaccine, since produced within 15 months?

Yes, know long term effects vaccine.

Ran Balicer says 50% cases unvaxxed kids 50% cases among adults fully vaccinated people. Now, since 85% adults fullly vaxxed, roughly means efficacy \~82% delta (not sure symptomatic covid infection). Hopefully data come soon. kids aren‚Äôt vaccinated all?  Hopefully children babies get protection soon. This! Waiting get first shot right now, I'm next line. Wish luck! mean start zero symptoms positive disease, later clinically cleared virus develop symptoms. gonna need far end pandemic.  video explains would mean personally 90% lower chance catch compared unvaccinated.. translate 10% chance infected. Except full approval won‚Äôt happen next year. yeah, coming winter unfortunately going plenty people dying due vaccinated. I'm told kids get sick need worry. 6 month old immune system definitely 8 year old. That's correct answer. Partially isn‚Äôt fully would expect doesn‚Äôt count. second largest Healthcare provider said yesterday 39% confirmed cases vaccinated NONE symptoms

The bigger question spread happen enough virus particles throat show positive PCR replicating enough (due vaccination) infectious. aymptomatic non-infectious, intents purposes probably even considered case. someone gets *partially* vaccinated? way elderly get vaccine. choose decision them. Kids 12 99.999999% chance mild symptoms all. know‚Ä¶like common cold don‚Äôt shut society for. It‚Äôs over. Time move on.  can't wrap head around fact many people country hardhearted cold would willingly let shit like happen. Even poor defenseless little babies! Hasn‚Äôt one primary goals throughout pandemic ‚Äúprevent hospital system overwhelmed‚Äù?

If that‚Äôs case models show potential effect hospitals happen certain percentage population still unvaccinated certain variants circulation seems reasonable impose health measures mitigate viral spread.

I don‚Äôt think anyone arguing societal lockdown 100% vaccination achieved. Requiring mask wearing contexts banning large gatherings lockdown.

We‚Äôre hopefully going good data soon UK relatively high vax rate Delta predominant restrictive health measures already lifted. far seems like cases hospitalizations largely uncoupled vax rates even Delta circulating. remains true pass impending peak cases Delta seems like little chance returning ‚Äúlockdown‚Äù style health measures long vax rates high enough. Mask wearing bans certain high risk activities however may needed occasionally new variants. sleeping fine night‚Ä¶ actually means every 110 people test positive, 100 vaccinated mRNA vaccines goddamned genius. building giant statues scientists developed these. egos stronger life itself, apparently. wonder close herd immunity still tons unvaccinated people, things going continue bad delta variant ascending. relatively young, get treated properly soon, grandma got unfortunately disabled.

I'm really glad did, say second shot triggered strong flare symptoms plus extremely odd skin rashes 5 weeks still appears there. bad situation, definitely triggering preexisting autoimmune disorders, something affecting people's decision get it.

Unfortunately sore arm light fever everyone. automatically rule may cautionary measure wake first serious outbreak post mass-vaccination? honestly can‚Äôt even believe freaking audacity Brits even suggesting let countries Europe, quarantine free, you‚Äôre ass Delta variant. seriously cannot immagine arrogant. Insanity. Yeah, way easily vaccine. comment antivax I'm sayin person who's sensitive reaction could easily harm acute overreaction provoking cytokine storm. Israel massive 16 y.o. population, mostly vaccinated all. vast majority require hospitalization, leaves us adults hospitalized. adults vaccinated one dose, almost two doses.

Unfortunately, appears vaccine efficacy took significant hit Delta strain Israel. vaccinated way earlier everybody else, thus immunity waning among fully vaccinated. would take. mean? long covid, would be, definition symptom...  University's malaria vaccine efforts

Three shots booster shot year later... 77% efficacy rate. Yikes.

mRNA really future. Johnson &amp; Johnson Florida long wanted make population younger.

Killing snowbirds seems successful move direction. wrong Well got moderna ia thing protection wise? general number saw one us states 1200 breakthrough cases 8 million vaccinated. IMHO they‚Äôve got predicting higher number breakthrough cases asymptotic think threat high unvaccinated population. 

Like said, trying understand. Helps predict happen live. First widespread infection happen 60% fully vaccinated. course mean Flu Colds. 

After year half COVID I'm still convinced dangerous kids Flu winter infections. 

Since covid began 11 deaths 0-19 age group Israel, prior conditions. That's 300K confirmed cases probably another 300K unconfirmed age group.

So vaccinated get sick kids get severely sick die worry about? Ah, think misread initial post. Thought meant number vaccinated patients high. agree moving goalposts part, reality always large % unvaccinated virus spread.

So essentially, vaccinate young people, either accept rising number cases without immediately panicking hospitals probably even notice anyway, keep restrictions forever. Yep right, misinterpreted it. Yes 80% eligible population. point vast majority hospitalization small minority unvaccinated people. First, see actual data - including testing data btw, likely context vaccinated people overrepresented (e.g., among returning travellers). 40% represent overall data, data specific outbreak, what?

Additionally, even assuming that's is, would imply 60+% efficacy infection among vaccinated people. distrust FDA every day. probably best example regulatory capture found U.S. government, that's saying something clear virtually every government policy enacted clearly intended benefit corporations. Stop approving drugs work! FYI, someone like gf‚Äôs mom opt get vaccinated. functionally contraindications mRNA jabs severe reaction first CoVid shot. 

I understand hesitancy, severe reaction one type immunization mean severe reaction all. said, she‚Äôs place high rates immunization, understand wanting ride nearing herd immunity. lets know, standby anaphylaxis occurs. 

Source: medical student can‚Äôt bother get free vaccine even keep infants getting sick It‚Äôs actually 57% doesn‚Äôt. 90% means every 100people test positive, 90 vaccinated.   Also, nasopharyngeal *and* anal samples. Can't safe enough, right? Exactly. Also regardless protected vaccine, still people protected vulnerable, mention still **pandemic**. Looks like can't understand still transmit - that's exactly what's happening right now. perfect example selfishness. different saying ""I give single f\*ck others get sick die"". saying 400+ cases 10% breakthrough cases? arrival quotes health ministry officials says 40% vaccinated  spend 1.5 years without travelling, bunch drunk bozos allowed cross border controls consequences. Fuck this. That's true every single one 5 million exposed covid, even remotely case. Besides, started, numbers go daily on. another post discussed. 90% effective 90% population vaccinated, seeing half new cases vaccinated unexpected? Tokyo local here. believe people don‚Äôt much resistance toward mask wearing Western cultures unfamiliar wearing masks. 

People may wearing masks majority time public, enough prevent COVID spreading. article May, example: [Japan‚Äôs offices, schools nurseries become Covid‚Äôs personally surprised cases going now, since I‚Äôve seen person people showing town. COVID vigilance fatigue understandable, I‚Äôm definitely scared need essential activity like going hospital big city. would necessarily extrapolating anything? likely cautionary measure waiting see outbreak unfolds. Natural selection work last reported, 41 cases uk. Experts apparently concerned appears outpacing delta likely become dominant. shows efficacy. many vaccinated population got covid. 

There population demographic difference unvaccinated vaccinated. Yup. 


For example, I'm t1 diabetic. carried gene whole life, dormant bad virus 28. ""triggered"" body start attacking beta cells pancreas.  relevant? 7 billion people ONE person covid started? what? 

It's efficacy here. still leaves 43% fully vaccinated. That‚Äôs still huge number given vaccines weak delta one dose Covid gets infected 40% cases fully vaccinated people‚Ä¶

Source?

Additionally, that's conduct statistical analysis. efficacy vaccines seen vaccinated vs. unvaccinated, overall % vaccinated.  necessarily, know many double vaxxed. Man, Americans Reddit seriously believe Scandinavia fucking utopia üòÇ  5 million people vaccinated, 500 got covid. based anecdotal stories Scotland delta hotspot, lots unvaccinated people saying caught covid second time recent weeks.

It'll take studies done confirm true. Transplant patients can‚Äôt get vaccinated many cases. mother going therapy Multiple Myeloma vaccinated, ineffective can‚Äôt vaccinated several years (apparently). four year old can‚Äôt vaccinated either, even could takes immunosuppressant help kidney transplant. 
That‚Äôs two people small immediate family can‚Äôt vaccinated abs risk idiots. Makes angry sure  15% patients country 80% uptake. I‚Äôm expert estimating efficacy, seems pretty high. Yeah case, 40% cases fully vaccinated people‚Ä¶ Yes? 90% still means 1 10 exposed catch it. people one dose Israel. something like 61% least one dose 57% fully vaccinated wait? risk taking another vaccine readily available? Vaccines wonder long vaccine effective protect administering one dose it?   percentages would require seem odd. super low test positive rate. Worldwide number breakthroughs also super low. extrapolating actual breakthrough rate require mask mandate again? That‚Äôs sort technical version question. Honest question: would someone ever watch *youtube* video topic? Find reliable news, YouTube isn‚Äôt. suggest old fashioned media like newspapers websites. Everything else (including site) viewed lot skepticism small handful respected news outlets.

If 18 taken lot vaccines already. billion people least taken one you. take one it‚Äôs primarily people around you. Kids can‚Äôt take it, elderly might immunity despite vaccination.

Your disease risk small vaccine risk small. There‚Äôs argument comparable magnitude young people, - take also sake someone else, argument disappears . So.. **successs** *(its asyntomatic things fine)* rookie numbers, gotta pump up. one got vaccine worried dare say Olympics corrupt! Where‚Äôs money? /s   Norwegians high level trust government reason to, country role model governments work many ways. Damn, really dont know fucking anything ultra-orthodox communities behave israel  Uh, no? scared *(Israel 'just one Yeah can't get one due meds liver fail. Rough months, get round 1 next week dudes. Stoked able go confidently again. really big issue people vaccine won‚Äôt work even get it.

Hard agree, - plus immunosuppressed - ones I'm concerned (I narrowly latter category myself, me).

And I'm asked understand refuse vaccine ""personal reasons"" &amp; nothing but, best response. Since posted, revised language say vaccine safe people 18 years older. 

‚ÄúChildren adolescents tend milder disease compared adults, unless part group higher risk severe COVID-19, less urgent vaccinate older people, chronic health conditions health workers.  

More evidence needed use different COVID-19 vaccines children able make general recommendations vaccinating children haven‚Äôt seen news media (left right) pick information general  got whooping cough randomly twenties. fun games cracked rib it. Shit fun. know ends. time around, keep boat it‚Äôs over. know risks. Yeah, got data. Sorry, get little trigger happy I've seen study data get misapplied often sub ""prove"" things say. 

As percentages here, know, would hypothesize behaviour patterns might explain it? appears single vaccinated person symptomatic, means likely got tested necessity upcoming event travel required it. fully vaccinated people disproportionally getting tested behavioral reasons symptomatic unvaxed people get tested due illness, could rationalize difference. 

That's theory course, makes sense me. Agreed, Covid January mild. High temperature, headache, cough loss taste smell. recovered 4-5 days tested negative multiple times around 2 weeks initial positive. spent 2 months throwing morning, chills throughout day, zero appetite brain fog. worse actually Covid, multiple blood checks never found anything.

I always told ""long covid"" wait basically. Longest 2 months life could hardly anything.

I hope aunt recoveres soon, send love random redditor.  Yeah sort little needle could put special medicine inside body make get disease. anyone know there's anything like covid? would pretty cool big medicine companies already thought trying this. priority vaccinate. Ok nowhere near 100% people fully vaccinated. Israel 56%. hopeful glad vaccinated, know problem over. I'm currently quarantining right getting vaccine March still contracted Covid first public outing several weeks ago. Ive knocked ass week luckily go hospital anything. Basically cold flu 6 days basically can't anything normal everyday living stuff fatigue.  TSA mandate place September 15th. couple months ago would never thought this, think date they‚Äôll drop requirement domestic flights US airports. feel like international flights require masks probably another year.

Just guess though! It‚Äôs apparently difficult humans. really. Look headline. It‚Äôs spreading killing unvaccinated people. Basically natural selection work. evidence vaccinated people wearing masks make difference numbers? True think I‚Äôd rather cold days wear masks everywhere. sound like antimasker, made skin bad make harder breathe Covid final nail crazy coffin in-laws. slow decline since 2016, mostly manageable long stuck neutral topics like music football (actually football ended not-neutral topic players started kneeling). covid hit...I dont know. still believe anything liberal conspiracy make Trump look bad. Like, point millions dying around world bat eyelash. overblown them. believe every conspiracy theory peddled vaccines, every fox news lie, although I've never broached subject directly, I'm sure sure they've started drinking Qool-aid too. I'm end. dont know do. 

It's funny quite wife literally ready write off. Call every couple months check them, essentially contact, stepped mend them. Now, know. general consensus seems haven‚Äôt vaccinated point that‚Äôs problem. 

It's everybody's problem. 

If doubly vaccinated optimistic, might perhaps 90% protection. 

But let's pretend 99% protection. case fatality rate 0.1%. let's say 0.01%.

So factors 1% 0.01%, 10^-6 . 

Let's put perspective moment. work aircraft industry, safety standard civil applications 10^-9 catastrophic failures per flying hour.

So 100 times safer reality, COVID-19 exposure risk still 1,000 times risk considered acceptable designing airliner, yet still socially acceptable afraid flying. 

The real risk 10^-4 , significantly higher risk flying fast jet, IIRC aligns design risk space launch. 

Whilst protection offered individuals vaccination nice, objective exercise vaccinate enough people generate herd immunity, prevents outbreaks growing. 

If Rt &lt; 1 people never exposed risk first place protection offered mass vaccination therefore far exceeds offered individual. reason, vaccination civic duty akin military service wartime. boggles mind Americans venerate military worship flag prepared tolerate mutinous indiscipline. Kids 12 virtually never die COVID anyway, sort non-issue. wanted hide would submit journal later removed? agree it‚Äôs great stop spread diseases, feel like society get back normal eventually. dealing flu decades many ways prevent want cut spread, masks cut spread

Any evidence someone asymptomatic fully vaccinated? one making claim. people certain medications, mostly immunosuppressants make shots ineffective. given via infusions every months (one know every 6 months). people told wait certain number months past last infusion order maximize chances vaccine works. might mean never get it, advised get yet. 

The really big issue people vaccine won‚Äôt work even get it. never said sounded scary, infection rate vaccinated vs unvaccinated, worthy conversation instead downvoting. I‚Äôve gotten Pfizer. wife gotten J&amp;J. worried delta? Safe assume even gets it, odds extremely unlikely bad? Unless deaf hard hearing. This. mRNA vaccines going incredible (positive) impact world. We‚Äôve focusing effective mRNA vaccines Covid, potential application far wide ranging that. 2 year old 4 year old pointing woman without mask costco yesterday asking wearing one. Bc I‚Äôm accommodating people refusing vaccinated anymore. That‚Äôs whatever happens problem. gov't predicted 90%, actual figures closer 97% - 98%.

NGL I'm little jelly. made decide get tested? sore throat weeks back get covid test I've vaccinated. go get strep test, Dr recomend covid test either. That‚Äôs wrong Yep. arms race mutating molecule! ‚ÄúNow‚Äù? Haven‚Äôt virtually COVID deaths among unvaccinated since beginning pandemic? exactly point vaccinated people ever dying. Ah ok fair enough one's brains vaccinated indeed us Agreed, although that's low hanging fruit, good one call out. However, also one I'd expect get solved - hopefully sooner rather later, sake 12 &amp; especially.

Other groups I'm curious easy numbers, even numbers all. also expect young (2 years less) grouping, suspect ease solution 12. perhaps do? know. easier keep general population least already mechanisms place handle vaccinations newborns (when do, etc).

Still curious people - stick, can't get period among others. Still, thanks calling important demographic out. Sorry give greater (any?) recognition. Guess dont kids. Im 100% sure parents dont want kids go sickness. son two dealt last year collective relative idiots. younger sibling outlier demands see ‚Äúhis nephew.‚Äù tell go get jabbed can, starts conspiracy BS hang him. 

Ain‚Äôt nobody got time dat‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt understand goal people trying actively discourage vaccination. objective? honestly think helping people? must, right? Stay home sic, come thicc! 
2021 version. seatbelt works, airbags? airbags work, brakes? Lol get from. first I'm hearing nonsense, even true 500k people died 2020 2021. numbers change like that. ‚ÄúLevy told state broadcaster Kan Bet 40% 50% new cases appeared people vaccinated, Haaretz reported. appear specify time frame new cases.

The figure likely estimate, ministry still analyzing cases. Monday, Levy said third new daily cases people vaccinated.

It clear whether people fully partially vaccinated.‚Äù

Directly article. 

What data talking about? see estimates know literally zero information full/partial immunity age. There‚Äôs lot missing information don‚Äôt think infer mRNA vaccines don‚Äôt work variant. 

The thing consider Israel low cases Covid numbers low it‚Äôs hard make ‚Äú40-50%‚Äù new cases vaccinated people sound scary. 

Additionally, link study real actual data showing effectiveness. ummmm it‚Äôs US? 

that‚Äôs guess can't even sue shoot you, recourse people infected swine flu either. know efficacy means, example napkin math give general idea expected. Efficacy 90%, we've seen real world data Pfizer vaccines, means 90% cases unvaccinated person would gotten prevented vaccine. AKA, take group vaccinated people group unvaccinated people, 90% fewer cases group vaccinated people.

So come article saying that, even 50% population fully vaccinated, nearly 50% cases coming vaccinated people? math add up. say that, worst basically every side effect could legitimately thought going die  makes sense follow precautionary principle since downside risk deaths much higher cost wearing masks. people get shot get mutations covid vaccine work that's matters. live Denmark haven‚Äôt called vaccination unfortunately. 34 age group last inline - 16-29 year olds vaccinated bigger spreaders corona. It‚Äôs bullshit. Wish could get vaccinated. knew something really wrong. Like guy still going full alarmist cased super low now? think it‚Äôs entirely reasonable expect people wait vaccines actually work reduce community spread discarding precautions. Vaccines perfect protection - work lower number possible transmissions occur. I've already vaccinated. sister told pediatrician get still nursing. parents refusing get because, frankly, they're scared vaccine that's come less twenty years ago--and feel compelled rationalize decision unprompted every time talk. Feels like they're looking validation that; can't well slurp back arm could.

Lot water bridge, they're gonna they're gonna do, want getting sister nephew sick. cancer deaths plummet first time 35 years. Yes. sir. Good day. thread dead now. research. Good nigh.......t 50% vaccinated effecacy would 99%, would see 99,5% unvacced hospital. Logistically, simpler give one dose vaccine need worry getting people come back. eg: NYC setting popup vaccine booths subway stations using J&amp;J. believe also vaccinations homeless camps using J&amp;J.

Also, working class folks, take day work possibly extra days case side effects big barrier. one dose shot half disruption two dose shot. hope recover soon this. sounds terribly hard.   half year far didn‚Äôt vaccinations. That's efficacy numbers mean. can't take efficacy percentages multiply sample number get statistically significant predictions.

Efficacy determined delta control group vaccinated test group. scale studies done Pfizer (or major covid vaccine) majority control group get COVID either chances getting COVID given group people fairly low absolute terms even though far high acceptable health terms. 

So efficacy gives improvement delta base rate likelihood X number people given cohort get COVID vs. number people expect get similar cohort 100% vaccinated. Mainly 'vaccinated countries' yet - i.e. around 80-85% vaccine coverage cases low pretty much ignorable. take much longer get there, we're quite yet. Better keep restrictions place another weeks open early spend months regretting it. source info? saying you‚Äôre wrong, think that‚Äôs super helpful talked nearly much mean, chance infant dying COVID like 1/10000 chance dying car accident choking IDS.

Gone days double blind controlled trials.... what's point comment? disprove person responded said. feel. rare exception legit cannot get vaccine, fuck rest them. Let loudly proclaimed ignorance real world consequences. 500k extra people died last year. think lie that? think thought would encourage people get vaccinated wear mask anymore, course work like pretending masks help conserve supply health care workers work.

He lowered indoor gathering limits 100 people 25 people last August small spikes. He‚Äôs total ‚Äúbetter safe sorry‚Äù Governor.   I'm mostly upset poor phrasing comes way makes vaccines seem worthless. know worthless, many less informed people take wrong way.

This people need hear right now. odds issues vaccinated low. Encouraging words surrounding vaccines message every time. Thank you. hope third shot helps! 1. ""there"" recovering pandemic, deaths return near normal numbers. Every week since March 28, 2020 excess deaths. numbers starting get range falls near average past 5 years, initially stated: Yet. 

Crappy vaccination numbers around US going help much complete vaccinations would. Delta variant spreading going help either. one needs ""kept hostage"", could care enough fellow citizens still take precautions.

2. 729,234 Excess Deaths US since Feb 2020 ""isn't bad"". 22.9% increase All-Cause Mortality 2020 -- 6 people dying every 5 expected -- ""isn't bad"". Weeks January Deaths 145% expected ""isn't bad"". Got it.

0.2% *diagnosed* influenza patients die average year (estimated 0.002% infections). 1.8% *diagnosed* US COVID cases died (estimated 0.6% infections). 0.19% US Citizens died COVID. way worded seemed could saying unvaccinated wear masks. don‚Äôt know US reimplement masks anywhere unless cases go like Missouri. think pretty good example.

Globally speaking willing vaxx didnt chance yet. one big herd say. 79% effective...which means *can* infected spread vaccinated, exactly poster said.

Your information correct understand town, 50% general public following outdoor masking worst months pandemic, September 2020-January year. 

I‚Äôm expecting number lower make mandatory again. ought nuance advice accordance vaccine type, make blanket statements increase vaccine hesitancy Lol, way draw wrong conclusion Asymptomatic mean ""cannot spread virus"" means ""infected without obvious symptoms"" According article, 90% infected fully vaccinated either asymptomatic mild symptoms. disagree they‚Äôre same, analogy perfect. Common sense says vaccines create magical barrier around prevents viruses entering body. virus first inside immune system anything them.

It common sense avoid contact potentially life threatening virus much possible, immunized not. grocery store selling contaminated meat exactly understand people reluctancy take it, new, one really knows, etc. feel like people vaccinated OK people skeptical annoying thing CDC says ""vaccinated people required wear masks unvaccinated people still should"" already know people want get vaccinated people wear masks, even make stipulation? Saying literally saying ""no one needs masks anymore"" them. That's bold statement someone idea. Unless invited CDC meetings? 2 people, 3 people? Title say 88% symptomatic infection cases going much New Jersey? Better vaccines, treatments, detection methods. Eventually might reach herd immunity vaccinations natural immunity. source efficacy details variants? I've seen overall efficacy released last week (and, nothing efficacy numbers individual variants - statements saying effective them). Literally everything life risk. could say ""I'm never taking shower want slip break neck"". fact people suck risk assessment. know pre-existing conditions end day vast vast majority people take bigger risk skipping vaccines taking it. special health situation, allergy, means take it.

And cheerleading vaccine ""these things fucking work"" anything else. riddled smallpox polio society smart people made useful vaccines people took. I'd like see embracing vaccines those, thanks social media idiocy politics, going happen. meam also account fact WORLD health organization guidance meant cover countries worse vaccines low vaccination rates. 79% 92%, make information entirely incorrect. Skepticism respect experts mutually exclusive concepts. can't possibly experts every area science, anyone thinks probably prime example Dunning-Kruger. need hire Deloitte tell cities Covid? isnt Drosten meant say. Rather seems Covid19 many ways change. Different strains seem form identical mutations, convergent evolution. see even immune escape variants vaccines help, more, worse. develope new vaccines new mutations needed within 6 weeks.

The CDC credibility me. look graphs, weeks ago rates men women. Prevalence remains boys girls school age.

It roughly equal among young adults eight around time football started, gap started widen right up. something always present, look like that. *could* Delta variant attacks men preferentially, think we'd seeing across wider range age groups young men exactly group indoor party kind age.

I think schools US open fall. 

The delta variant spread like wildfire unvaccinated populations July, vaccines use US still provide incredibly powerful defense. 

Because vulnerable population much smaller previous waves variant infectious, think we‚Äôll see fast rise fall next month. We‚Äôll see happens Israel UK, that‚Äôd guess. 

My mid August bet retreat again. 

And know vaccines effective, place require vaccines stay open so. lack evidence, seems case here, use common sense we're sure safe¬ø I'm fine this. They've made choice. It'll thin herd crazies increase number COVID long haulers probably vote universal healthcare. Yeah delta variant story say 50% cases people vaccinated. case would bigger story. like virus stories unvaccinated spreading virus getting sick. telling vaccinated people wear masks keep track people easier...it's cause vaccinated people spread get virus.  I've wondering too. must data coming soon hope read 2 days ago AstraZeneca‚Äôs vaccine also 90% effective delta variant. 

I read anything Johnson Johnson similar Astra Zeneca would expect similar results terms difference efficacy earlier variants delta.

Hope everything stays green! huge believer vaccines. constantly encourage others get vaccinated even convinced family so. told way restrictions announcement...what exit strategy? Vaccines always best shot way out. Wait......... third choice??????  unfortunately, relatively young still live her! really rank efficacy even though would say mRNA ones far superior. 

I think people talk efficacy comprehend tried compare set score. Now, advice I'll heed US exited decline phase entering new rise phase. High vaccination states cannot decline fast enough make rising cases low vaccination states. Multiple states lower vaccination rates Missouri, Delta continue spread lower vaccinated regions within states. 

While vaccinated people impacted, vast majority unvaccinated. COVID become disease choice. listen government media anyone else? Read medical journals. Go straight source. Find actual data. public. mechanism action theses vaccines completely understood. statistics data support vaccination.

Phobia needles real understandable. know others avoided vaccine reason. hope able rationalize situation find coping mechanism able address that.  Thanks adding ""novel virus"". That's part that's concerning this, virus exist humans \~Dec 2019. So, 18 months worth data it, much work with. 

And, mean downplay amazing vaccines are, highlighting they're absolute. But, they're fucking amazing, think I'll start quoting they're 99.9% effective, that's number that's important. boyfriends tested positive covid last year.

The evidence overwhelming favor vaccination. It‚Äôs like December doses starting. give away every month.  Imagine much would suck 0.2% though Still right answer, depends percentage population (and parts population) vaccinated. 

A accurate way putting 10 unvaccinated people would gotten symptomatic COVID, instead 1 unvaccinated person would. Pfizer net profit 2020 less 10 billion. Would give away 20% income reason? even shareholders keep happy. probably old sick people, wait full 14-30 days vaccine work. Dear god‚Ä¶

The numbers, that's who.

Unless Team Covid, drop ~70% effectiveness ~60% effectiveness good get idea, vaccines supposed protect symptomatic infections?

Effectiveness symptomatic infection one primary criteria vaccines judged far. example, one thresholds used FDA criterium successful vaccine 50% effectiveness preventing symptomatic infection, lower bound 95%CI fallen point barely that, there's good chance drop threshold variants not-too-distant future.

Beyond that, consistently explicitly championed idea achieving population immunity (herd immunity) vaccination.

That's virtually impossible vaccine ~60% effective symptomatic infection. better-performing vaccines there, still real -- increasingly distant -- possibility. someone give low here, likely see variant going resistant current vaccines? next step, booster? They‚Äôre low relative onset vaccination campaign. That‚Äôs metric used Israel Canary populations large percentage vaccinated people. Honestly, think herd immunity really reached anywhere. Covid simply become endemic, perhaps enough issue justify lockdowns anymore certain point. vaccines natural immunity slowly diminish size outbreaks, probably us long time. real question world's governments accept reality covid us varying degrees quite while. important things enough hospital capacity become ill, continue promote vaccine, prepared surges there. Vaccinated people allowed live normal life. Especially science becomes clearer vaccinated people simply really even game (don't really contract covid, spread it) covid become problem refuse get vaccinated, much easier handle pandemic everyone. 1) Trends matter, random stat picking part right there. 
2) Deaths lag cases people prone dying COVID. part society vaccinated already, now. vaccines don‚Äôt shit people dropping like flies Delta variant Israel vaccine not. city worker SF; required provide documentation evidence full vaccination. others said, partial vaccination count. makes mad. family members getting vaccine. swear get covid, getting plane see nobody. scared mind whole year, I‚Äôve vaccinated 2 months driving 2hrs (2x) place extra vaccines give damn peace mind make appointment go won‚Äôt.

Um, no, react *stronger* immune system stronger least regard specific pathogen.

Weak immune systems result real reaction pain. second vaccine typically worse. Israel‚Äôs hospital admissions always relatively low compared population due split society. Certain people don‚Äôt access. Pfizer So, support restrictions US, since COVID deaths (@300/day) still double worst flu deaths last 50 years (@165/day, annualized)?

Israel's 7-day moving average Cases climbed 10 June 8th 97 June 24th. Deaths lag cases 3 weeks, wait deaths increase anything? mask mandate -- welding people apartments. Nearly 100% pfizer actually cried finally got online reserved first appointment.

I‚Äôm caregiver parents idea might die get long term damage unable help worse fears myself.

The relief among staff got immunized amazing. It‚Äôll still come, vaccines. verified 20%, I'll assume true exercise. 

You 20% chance needing hospitalization. 

The vaccine least 60% effective keeping hospital.

Without vaccine:
There 10 old people. Two sent hospital. (20% number people)

With vaccine:
There 10 old people. One sent hospital. 20% 12%. 

The reason 60% efficacy regards existing statistical likelihood hospitalized. 

60% * 20% = 0.6 * 0.2 = .12 12%

12% * 10 = 1.2 people. Since want cut old person 20% current overall body I've rounded 1.

But 1,000 people 120 people going hospital instead 200.

If 100,000 people 12,000 vs. 20,000.

That 8% adds lot people end. oh believe it. former fiend - ‚Äúbuahah old people die, don‚Äôt care‚Äù ‚Äúunborn babies miracle life‚Äù 4.8 multiplier continued possibly +160 Million (+34 million x 4.8) Americans might Covid19 already immune (+126 Million unknowingly)?

If 46% country fully vaccinated, 151 million, possible another 68 million (I subtracted 46% 126M ...gross estimated number people covid got vacinnated) possibly immune now...for total +219Million 66% (219M/330M) country. 27Million received least 1 shot...assuming +80% efficacy possibly another 22M immune 73% (241/330)?

Curious current infection rates correlate somehow that. coworker never it, proceeded explain it‚Äôs like it‚Äôs pretty much flu (I‚Äôve twice). Tbf, plenty countries high vaccine uptake regardless government's reputation (eg UK).  fewer side effects

I believe someone sub trial said really bad anxiety Novavax. something note already anxiety. side affect isn‚Äôt measure strong weak immune system. LOL  vs unvax deaths per month.

You'd need scale populations comparable too. want absolute number, want percentage population (vaccinated unvaccinated).  Ya is... immune system reacting protein virus. know vaccines work? body reacting protein next time comes contact faster response. Pfizer vaccine prevents 88% symptomatic cases, 79% infection Delta variant.

Basically, working quite well, mRNA vaccines still work incredibly well. Sadly, second part sentence probably ""Trump/Fox News/OANN said nothing. "" misleading give sensational misleading stats EVEN include others well. 

But fyi, even others misleading, instance May deaths:

It generally takes around 4-5 weeks time first infection get sick, get hospitalized, die, officially recorded. 
 
What percentage population fully vaccinated early April (so death gets recorded May), meaning got fist dose late January? that's people caught COVID immediately ""fully vaccinated."" Sorry downvoted, first point vaccinated people overrepresented almost certainly correct. That‚Äôs works all. LEAVE ALONE ENJOY VACCINE data makes sense. 56% population fully vaccinated vaccine supposed 88% efficacy symptomatic infection (or 79% infection), yet somehow 40% cases fully vaccinated people?

And somehow, 0 cases resulted people symptoms?

Something adding up. valid medical reasons almost nonexistent. many conditions may limit someone's response timing things like chemo important, flat can't get it.  niece doesn‚Äôt want get vaccinated says don‚Äôt know long-term effects vaccine are. don‚Äôt know long-term effects COVID are. 

We know short-term effects. 

I‚Äôm vaccinated, I‚Äôm thinking may actually go back lot careful, see Delta variant.

The speculation damage brain even people recovered little nervous making, think I‚Äôd like know Thanks info. check out. easily cancel rebook anyway :) take care 8 month YEars old baby covid19??? dont covid. UK vaccinating age brackets due low vaccine supply. started vulnerable (the elderly) went down. means 30s dose (although changing fast) fraction 40s fully vaccinated. virus spreading mostly among age groups. Israel data showed dropping 79%. lancet article said infections, would drop 90% level. 

But many many many places mess terms (hopefully Lancet wouldn't) may drop 95%.

They enough data say chance hospitalization increased delta not.

Still really good, go like 1/10 chance catching kind case exposure 1/5. It‚Äôs data doesn‚Äôt exist 

All peer reviewed research agrees    really, really hard make inferences trends based couple days data, especially lot states (seemingly including Alabama) batching data together rather reporting once, high count one day likely represent reporting backlog rather one day surge. said, 32% population Alabama fully vaccinated, they're starting relatively low baseline, we're hit summer months people spend time inside there's air conditioning, people relaxing physical distancing, *that* surprising case counts started going back introduction transmissible variants.

I'm going predict harder cases actually ""surge"" though way winter 2020 sizable fraction population vaccinated, even new variants. many hosts available virus spread anymore. oh actually live US figured title post would somewhat apply countries well really hope Israel's recent decision beginning ""permanent masking"" ""masks every winter"" sort trend. they're one leading countries vaccinations, that's good sign all.   submission linking yahoo.com automatically removed source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Until enough people fully vaccinated, yes. variants concern need tamped ASAP control escape mutations. people still use Worldometers? yeah thing gets know low dosage Ivermectin also reduce viral load. something that's already exists, used studied.

it's just...not profitable 56% enough herd immunity strain. Estimated OG SARS-CoV-2 70%. infectious variants go up, down. concerns Alpha variant made kids symptomatic, necessarily really sick, enough tested, ripple effects others tested. Really showed kids spreading pretty readily.

Fortunately, variant came around right Schools letting summer. kids can't vaccinated, Delta variant permeates summer, challenges Schools again. 

Fortunately recent relief package provided lot money Schools pandemic related costs cause problem county. County went back School close full time, 1/3 parents still opted virtual, live conservative area. 4 days week, 5, Wednesdays extra sanitation.

Like mostly antivaxxers dying point, choice us vaccinated relax little bit. find amusing someone never provided source first place complains someone elses source. Irresponsible states never going hit goals stay closed.

Seems like irresponsible states either set low goals said fuck opened everything anyway I‚Äôm sorry. got early February. really use inhaler. lungs worst, moderate asthma got worse I‚Äôm two extra inhalers now. gets better it‚Äôs incremental, slow. point walk around one block 5 days asthma problems stop. work remote sit couch 3 hours afternoons although exhausts me. really hope feel better, truly sucks. still take plane right now, plane crash rate same. drive car, crash rate same. ain't taking vaccine chance killing %0,3, sorry bro.

By way, never wore mask well. Nothing happened far. I'm well healthy. Fauci emails exposed already. seems think like lol

If you, get vaccine, since long term effects still unknown, since humanity produced vaccine 15 months opposed 10 years corona. seriously believe 'just bit longer' part? vaccinated yet, giant fucking bullseye back. like people WANT COVID-19 restrictions last forever  THIS.

Send BS: article literally says less deaths united states lol. shitty title virus ravaging anti-vaxers anti-maskers 

They're literally volunteering Let kill idiots. society would better  says ""90 percent effective preventing symptomatic coronavirus cases"". Symptomatic word I'm focused on. 

I think know true effectiveness vaccine actually preventing infection. says little effectivity preventing transmission still unclear. 

They stopped tracking total infections vaccinated people, least US, wanted focus number vaccinated people hospitalized (if remember correctly). 

My thoughts that, Israel, may testing people exposed symptoms? maybe that's number vaccinated people much higher. go detail severity cases. majority vaccinated infected people could asymptomatic. Yeah, that's reasonable precaution insist visitors vaccinated.

Vaccinated not, still masking up. far know, found virus can't passed vaccinated people, *probably* can't passed behaves like others. We're talking worthwhile people give it. like anonymity Dogs catch though determined dogs get sick even spread effectively humans. 

Worst case scenario appears dogs mild symptoms Covid-19. numbers ""severe illness hospitalization.""

No aren't. Heck even unvaccinated 80's still 20% chance hitting hospital catch covid. Peace boner jizz Yeah wear mask kids people can‚Äôt get vaccinated. Also look WAY better mask without. aggravating friends argue this.  Delta variety seems care young old, equally bad age. I'm arguing ""point view,"" arguing usage certain phrase job stay inside mask unvaccinated idiots protect themselves?

Nobody said dna mutation 

This staggeringly incorrect.

I'd start ""it's body carry specific antibody cell.

Cuz endured covid winter vaccines. 

With 70% population set vaccinated end July, covid sane states cratered. 10,000 cases day PA January 212 today. near full number deaths refusing vaccinate

Good luck though. easy say ""got mine, I'm done."" part wear mask (literally least anybody could do) help get us tiny bit closer herd immunity people can't protected vaccine safe, course will. 

The infuriating part people get vaccinated they're convinced none necessary reason still necessary. everyone eligible got vaccinated there'd barely covid left take measures against. Wonder numbers low today states going updating much anymore. Sort like FL cases reported daily anymore, could see states reporting vaccines daily. already saw big data dump last Thursday - could case. Maybe someone tracks state state data could weigh people legitimate reasons hold vaccines, example recovered patients strong protective immunity. still studying mRNA vaccines may exasperate autoimmmune/inflammatory symptoms post-COVID patients.

Kids vaccinated late 2021 best, according Dr. Fauci. likely enough cases either placebo control group make study statistically significant. see spike, however, could accelerate approval. recommending masks everyone Delta, fuck...

Seriously social end freaking again?

Despite lack official announcements, I'm going assume school require masks next year again. That's I'd rather nice surprise masks required even though expected be, suddenly shocked require I've assumed won't. I'm senior FML. overly pessimistic, realistic?

Justice says West Virginians entering ‚Äòdeath lottery‚Äô deciding vaccinated COVID-19

By Jeff Jenkins 
June 22, 2021 - 1:40 pm

CHARLESTON, W.Va. ‚Äî Gov. Jim Justice said Tuesday plans discontinue COVID-19 vaccination sweepstakes even leveling vaccination numbers Mountain State.


Gov. Jim Justice
During media briefing Tuesday state capitol, Justice said incentives still worth effort even though state recorded less 5,300 vaccinations past week.

‚ÄúWe gotta continue try. There‚Äôs reason whatsoever, whatsoever call we‚Äôve got we‚Äôre doing,‚Äù Justice said. ‚ÄúState state state exactly thing even we‚Äôre doing.‚Äù

The next round winners announced June 30. sweepstakes include cash prizes continue first week August. West Virginia using federal pandemic relief money fund prizes include giveaway $1 million week, new trucks, hunting rifles shotguns, lifetime hunting fishing licenses, college scholarships state park vacations.



New vaccination numbers Centers Disease Control show approximately 52% state‚Äôs eligible population fully vaccinated. numbers include 70% age 50 fully vaccinated. numbers drop significantly age 50.

Justice said haven‚Äôt vaccinated taking deadly chance.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs death lottery,‚Äù Justice said.

He said residents aren‚Äôt taking risk seriously.

‚ÄúIf bunch of, bunch of, bunch folks hadn‚Äôt vaccines started dying, bunch them, you‚Äôd see real response. wouldn‚Äôt need giving away lifetime hunting fishing license trucks‚Äìyou‚Äôd see people running get vaccine,‚Äù Justice said.


James Hoyer
State InterAgency Task Force Director Jim Hoyer also urged younger residents Tuesday agree vaccinated.

‚ÄúYou want right lottery West Virginia,‚Äù Hoyer said. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt want one puts hospital, one potentially causes lose life. want go vaccinated haven‚Äôt vaccinated.‚Äù

Hoyer said there‚Äôs ‚Äúlot work do‚Äù comes vaccinating ages 18-29 29-50.

Hoyer announce Tuesday COVID-19 hospitalizations dropped 100 patients first time nearly year.

‚ÄúThis first time since July 23, 2020 we‚Äôve hundred,‚Äù Hoyer said. [They ICU Panels. I‚Äôd happy convinced otherwise. [Look second row table caveat think it‚Äôs tracking results 7 days rather 14. So, maybe 10% goes full 14. 35% chance asymptomatic carrier 11 days last row isn‚Äôt encouraging. Works me. Yup suggest taking 500mg time (please consult doc pre-existing conditions allergic) huge problem people cards ever need show proof vaccination. What's solution? am, science point evidence-based policy? give credit trying find different ways connect citizenry holy shirtballs. claim given half hospitalised COVID patients UK gotten jab? AZ banned 40s, otherwise use, fair. That‚Äôs originally asked. wanted proof masks prevent spread (which obviously do).

Studies vaccinated people‚Äôs ability spread still ongoing; since still gathering interpreting data know breakthrough infections fully-vaccinated happening, makes sense use masks indoors learn more, wouldn‚Äôt say? know work; still learning well vaccines work. thanks. gonna die

the unvaccinated decided increase chances die earlier become crippled rest lifes.  thought like 60% effective something new variant, thats cool 40 100 peoole still get spread They‚Äôre winners Puget Sound. bought premium treatment must say much 1 dose protect hospitalization Delta? Bud, much back forth whether normal asymptomatic infections spread. papers sides argument. asymptomatic pre-symptomatic oh boy dancing done words. think enough evidence support asymptomatic spread probably know definitively long while. spread lead hospitalizations asymptomatic people.

And know still ask something, go, peruse confusion academic world: majority enough achieve herd immunity. would call public health policy implemented without evidence support effect? ""Covid always circulating""

We managed eradicate diseases global vaccination programs. Smallpox immediately comes mind close polio.  Wall Street Journal¬†reported Friday¬†that half adults infected outbreak delta variant Israel fully vaccinated the¬†Pfizer-BioNTech¬†vaccine, prompting government reimpose indoor mask requirement measures. follow science huh? he's saying majority population surrounded vaccinated. It‚Äôs win everyone decided get vaccinated believe evidence exists support claim. entire West Coast border states like Arizona Texas less vaccinated states? city can't go 2pm live metro, otherwise India everything already open. worst already passed, we're vaccinating 7-8 million day looking good. 

Hopefully covid November-december Natural selection. I'm public health official information relevant education experience have, I'm qualified judge that. Thats exactly works. LMAO, bad news still news, long true. mean keep selfishly adding list things need worry about. live society act like it. country, yeah, they're definitely woods, I'm curious see much variant impacts heavily vaccinated areas like VT, 70% ages 12+ fully vaccinated. far one case variant detected state, daily cases state-wide remain single digits death 5 weeks. I've errands going eat maskless (fully vaccinated, course), feels like really getting back normal here. really, really hope lasts. totally get point wants go story pandemic despite others discovering. shot 2 AZ tuesday - wed writeoff, started feeling better 9pm Why? Wasn‚Äôt trying attack, seems op means well panicking. couldn‚Äôt help pointing even post sub got deleted misinformation generally seem bit frustrated right now. Several posts got deleted, thread. think missing point take time google rather bothering person don‚Äôt believe them? I'm blathering - new shit come light, man. 

Dude, read article Maybe sell back France? entire west coast highly vaccinated huge concern. 48 hours wife tested positive, learned result isolated her. didnt get infected.

Hope's got nothing it.  Death Race 2021: worst sequel ever. free travel state states? highly vaccinated? purpose vaccination reduce severity infection. Heard immunity ideal scenario. misunderstanding nothing, hand are. taco bell do, ive seen it. one antivax sub (not sure name here) literally talking vaccinated people ""removed society"" they're ""ticking timebombs"" ""kill us all"". caution hysteria? made claim literally 8 minutes earlier right ^^ thread. literally always non-zero chance. eradicating this. entire state vaccinated Israel UK. West Virginia critical national security. Current mRNA vaccines good preventing infection Delta variant, whereas stunning preventing original variants we've seen far.

mRNA vaccines GREAT ameliorating symptoms improving outcomes Delta variant-- vaccine onboard take big viral load leads massive decrease hospitalizations death! possible decision evidence based? CDC like ‚ÄúAww, man. change website again. Fuck that!‚Äù CNN - make breaking news people die - deaths richer murcock become new shit? People move. Yup, started wearing mine earlier week. Hey, life. Feel free take chances. me, even vaccinated, non-zero chance enough, especially they're seeing brain. Look Israel, vaccinated country Earth, reinstating mask mandate answer. think fear might asymptomatic spread Delta variant, although new studies show one way whether prove case. Public health officials tend cautious. response normal response someone counter argument.

Trash name believe UAP, government confirmed there. always take argument counterpoint baseless attack. Seriously. many people still wearing masks worried 12s really makes look like people aren‚Äôt vaccinated don‚Äôt trust experts someone info lockdown currently place India?

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  Damn, people vaccinated good chance winning. problems understanding people hesitant get vaccine.  Literally every study masks Sorry, new shit come light, man. People spamming these. in, water wet. Honestly, kind news headlines promotes vaccine hesitancy. 

Some information needed want say doctor 2 nurses died fully vaccinated. needs placed context larger population. many people vaccinated, many people sick vaccinated, many people died vaccinated? Without information, saying doctors got sick, even mildly asymptomatically really helpful. Remicade. Prednisone years though. stopped taking good shortly getting vaccinated, system then. I'd take precautions (I'm sorry, know that's answer want). happened? Go quarantine lmao. never Florida 1,5 years compared California yet, %300 dead California covid Florida lmaooo.

Be guest 5 year quarantine. We're fun Miami speak, like past 2 years lol Israel quarantining vaccinated people showing symptoms?

And Israel asking vaccinated mask?

Is reason? dismal failure pandemic. success past relevant laughable ineffectiveness now. precisely recommending vaccinated people wear masks. ""I'm vaccinated, pandemic me."" strange view things.

You probably elaborate going make claim. Everyone different risk assessment. knowing 96% protected hospitalization enough. someone else thought might even come contact virus enough keep leaving house next decade. Depending point view, different things seem ""strange"". gonna HELL time convincing people go back masks variant serious... fucked telling people bring guards gonna round 2. asserted asymptomatic carriers carriers. agree. evidence fully vaccinated people mechanism asymptomatic carriers? viral load significantly reduced. never said impossible, much, much less likely. saw asymptomatic people could spread virus others last year US. statement taken one leading virologists Christian Drosten, may wanna google. high recognition. argument stems also endemic properties sarscov2, many experts share. example Frank Ulrich Montgomery said thing.  Indeed. easy Merkel take tough line. easy families finances line.

Was Rhodes towards end season last year. local business owners looked bad shape, mentally beaten down. One taxi driver told everyone praying busy October worried winter. earn enough October that's till next May. money.

The answer hurry double vaccines. know that's easy. Yes evidence masking protocols dropped early. 

Evidence static, data go straight line reverses constantly, sometimes better, sometimes not.

I really believe went full every person could vaccinate did, kept masks people could kept working home, would much better place. would able see friends small groups hang out. dropped are.

People vote me, hope blew it. Maybe get chance again.  So?

Let stupid people die. shitty genes won‚Äôt passed on‚Ä¶ seems like win win Data UK indicates efficacy 79% mRNA vaccines infection, includes asymptomatic infection. Studies also shown breakthrough infections far less likely transmit due reduced viral load

Your information incorrect could combine state databases. would nightmare it‚Äôs impossible. Yes people would fall cracks people might able prove individually. think people it‚Äôs fact still wear one fully vaccinated, what‚Äôs end game? Realistically covid going away, and, importantly, end? need exit strategy. Horseshit. delta variant around since November US possibly long that. mainstream media started reporting classic death doom articles, shortly reported White House going fall short vaccination goals. weren‚Äôt doom articles written that? weren‚Äôt.  Thank you. Sad true. Yes. stated article thread based on, literally addressed second paragraph last comment. didn‚Äôt even read it. he's Remicade. people Remicade develop decent antibodies two doses Pfizer, small percentage people don't. He's one unlucky few. non-zero chance enough

Brah, going long road ahead accept 0 chance. I'm California. mandates strict really enforced. get enforced people follow along honor system like (mostly) before.

I'm saying agree mentality, know people are. Yes, rule followers, minority methinks. Natural selection work Well, it‚Äôs probably half half fault then. IOC heavy handed Japanese government promoting travel dining since last summer. May ask takes methotrexate? dad RA takes methotrexate I‚Äôm worried may much protection thinks does. New Jersey residents sub, long think till Murphy re-implements mask mandates?

I‚Äôll bet we‚Äôre least gonna new indoor mask mandate sometime next two weeks. first pick 2021 COVID-19 Draft... Delta Strain selects...
A working class retired coal miner! Unless thing starts really spreading I‚Äôm gonna keep wearing mask maybe half time go out. live high vax rate vaccines effective delta That's great way putting it. Every single one asymptomatic.  That's fair. Still, nuance always welcome science medicine, biologically nuanced beings. googled found lot articles, say still possible, lower chance. point one specifically says possible? Leading vs lagging indicators. Repping PF body feeling good! Buncha savages town. I'm asking evidence asymptomatic fully vaccinated people carriers thus obligated wear masks. answer afraid vaccinated people still able spread virus. fear vaccinated. important note best fearmonger. mind asking medication takes? reading mom 5 mg Prednisone. FL right nervous bring something home. 99.9% vaccinated people survive infection even get it? Sounds pretty good me. Sucks peoples families, point simply nothing could done prevent deaths. worried. I've already *two* school years row negatively affected COVID, third year ruined (which looking increasingly likely), mental health *really* going go drain. June 25, 2021 (HealthDay News) -- Persistent COVID-19-related anosmia excellent prognosis nearly complete recovery one year, according research letter published online June 24 JAMA Network Open. No, make effort understand vaccines work, you‚Äôll likely understand there‚Äôs low chance side effects road.  Theres number studies this, search sub. we‚Äôre basically road ‚Äúwe need wait second generation vaccine‚Äù Delta variant? Maybe started heating articles around long time. perception reality. first confirmed case United States January 20th, 2020. Evidence based policy sense? evidence masks reduce transmission? Yes. evidence vaccines reduce transmission? Yes. evidence mask mandate reduce transmission. 

If asking evidence necessary, find any. slight inconvenience putting mask indoors public transportation vs potentially needing introduce stricter restrictions difficult choice make. Ahhhhhh see now. I'm referring state mask mandates like May 2020. pretty strongly enforced, I'd say, least states like one live right now. anyone know reason doesn‚Äôt antibodies? *Ugh somebody call developer* Ah got it, thanks explanation. Good luck him, wish people got heads asses long enough make world better place people like him. Individual state governors. Nah I‚Äôd say Northeast region Michigan mask mandates end next week. isn‚Äôt. two coincided almost perfectly. live NJ governor probably one first re-implement mask mandates guidance changed. 

So no, wouldn‚Äôt say pessimistic, I‚Äôd say wise tempering expectations. tail end pandemic

I'm sure anyone call are. one knows, one know, do. stupid run around fearmongering pretending over. sh*t going go waves, one less immunity going up.  OK. People pretending zero risk tolerance weirdos. blatant lie.  family friend working vaccines. far said likely (at least soon) need one they're still figuring out. Omg, must hard share house someone Fox News spell you‚Äôre not. reason NJ‚Äôs first dose shots went 200,000 today lol. Giving tracking data. Either somebody fat fingered deep issues data change almost two percent overnight. Yeah, big yikes numbers. :(

Maybe heat keeping people in? forgone conclusion everyone get infected? Say end 65% fully vaccinated (plus natural infections), many dead ends won‚Äôt infections burn out? don‚Äôt doubt keep circulating places don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs necessarily going infect everyone. Says person afraid ""mandating human behavior."" unlikely gamechanger. K417N mutation (that they're designating w/ ""plus"") seem allow much resistance vaccines/pre-covid-infection immunity. said variants (including previously contagious Alpha) picked K417N mutation spread far. likely transmissibility sufficient outcompete others already circulation. 
 
For great breakdown ""Delta Plus"" is, unlikely massive concern, see: 
  
 
 
""Delta Plus"" around since early April taken hold anywhere large numbers. 
 
Moderna also updated mRNA booster developed (and almost done testing) called mRNA 1273.351 specifically addresses mutation couple others found Beta cause reduced neutralization vaccines. said ready public use hopefully September: 
  ""they""? thing happen republic.  source shows fully vaccinated people covid asymptomatic unable spread unvaccinated people? seriously underestimating efficacy vaccines variants. evidence asymptomatic fully vaccinated people still carriers? guess we're going wind 20-30% COVID patients disabled chronic fatigue, based data SARS-1 MERS outbreaks. largest mass disabling event since WWII, huge number going young, working-age people.

Source:  Honestly I'm saying this, smallest least noticeable needle I've ever felt. Everyone I've talked Moderna Pfizer agreed bad all. afraid needles, one breeze. people ignore law nobody capable enforcing stuff. would end applying employees companies follow laws. wrong. keep seeing number thrown around without source. 

Looking US alone: 603k deaths 33.6 million cases = 1.8% death rate. 

If actually 0.02% death rate claiming, 603k deaths due COVID would mean 3 billion cases US obviously case. ‚ÄúPeople cannot feel safe two doses. still need protect themselves,‚Äù official Dr. Mariangela Simao told reporters.

Likely get vaccinated never saw anything negative come except media (which seems hot topic days) buy car I‚Äôm IIHS website looking top safety picks. research available safety features make sure car buy features top notch crash test ratings. 

I also research car seat look test results. Plus ensure installed correctly.  make sure daughter secured properly seat car moves. also don‚Äôt drive like maniac. 

I everything possible minimize risk comes driving child car; would anything less everything possible minimize risk getting virus. Hi idea sinovac effectivenes Delta varian? careful use language. COVID Coronavirus Disease, illness. asymptomatic contagious (or contagious), ill *technically* COVID. Although common language would say ""I tested positive COVID"", technically tested positive virus *causes* disease. clinician assess symptoms test results rule whether disease.

This leads massive disparities infection rates sorts misunderstandings. see medical professionals industry executives using misleading language without clarifying implied misunderstanding need know know language misleading, purpose, trust them.

Unlike COVID-19, vaccines contagious. gonna spontaneous abortion stand next vaccinated person. co-worker theory first dose might produce side effects akin second dose previously Covid. people know Covid got J&amp;J shot, sounds like worried two doses much them. sucks clear remaining symptoms, 2 weeks shit real thing was

A co-worker mine (different one above) type would ever skip shower even planning leave house said sick could take 1 shower 2 weeks. never imagined would ventilator got it, really drove home shitty even ""mild"" Covid is.  Yes, made sure get vaccinated, especially illness confirmed COVID. second shot gave 102.2 fever, feel like got relief afterward. remember struck burning breathing seemed markedly better 2nd shot; however, hard say problems intermittent. could placebo wishful thinking.

I serious breathing problems since 2nd dose vaccine, weird burning coals back losing consciousness problem. 

But sometimes get mildly short breath, (milder) burning back significant portion day, days. Also tension and/or pain right leg night, and/or neck and/or throat day. Plus terrifying stroke-like symptoms.

I really hoping stroke-like stuff something mundane like sleeping wrong, things never happened got sick. switch PCP one constantly try steer toward SSRI, maybe get answers soon. ever completely. best bet vaccinate many people can. There's way I'd taking part to-be Olympian. I'd rather quit team take bet virus.  think side effects usually take around 24 hours **IF** them.

I nothing mild arm soreness second Pfizer dose. large scale Darwinism finest folks.  Moderna. side effects either dose. bring people like moan mild side effects had. 99.8% way sexier /s example, mRNA unstable must stored cold temperatures remain intact. Even then, begin degrade period time won‚Äôt work convey immunity injected. reason think covid less likely long term affects one time exposure partial non self-replicating versions virus?

This rhetoric particularly hostile working class, unemployed, homeless, minority, etc populations remnant Reagan days led us right unproductive discussion, idiots arguing pleasurable debt nothing it, given choice. lost job back January, able score 8 interviews two weeks. friend left manager job, got many interviews week, unbelievable.

Good you. Now, time understand experience good luck one is.  Ahhh okay. makes sense. kind thought it'd something like that. trying get sense effective vaccine time pandemic ever resolved (as in, get control lock every quarter rest eternity). Sigh...

Thanks answering questions! Vaccinated spreaders lot difficult detect asymptomatic. Hence masks. need high vaccination numbers achieve herd immunity case. every virus spreads asymptomatically. real nurse already knows clean area skin injection volunteers may not? would much worried kids live world maybe 10 20 years left uninhabitable, enough food water everyone. exactly? Delta evade? everything I've seen might make vaccine little less effective, still looking like 80-90 percent effective still? still don‚Äôt seem understand many different kinds Interferon. read paper linked.

The vaccines, none besides J&amp;J‚Äôs approved 1 dose vaccine. Reducing efficacy full vaccination 91% 88% meaningful. live US, covid exactly year ago. don‚Äôt trust antibodies still there, get sick super easy, got vaccine. friends also refuse vaccine. I‚Äôm interested see plays out. Well eventually Covid vaccination become standard vaccination infants, like measles chicken pox. restrictions needed then, nobody get Covid (apart anti-vax, see measles).

What happens depends well use restrictions inducements vaccinate - likely vary regions. example South America wrecked right now, whereas Europe much better. US quite getting vacine coverage needs, likely suffer more. vaccines prevent getting spreading it, prevent serious illness death. Yup. MIL immune compromised got shot. don't, depends hospital capacity demographics. Young people less likely get hospitalized, example. Yeah unfortunately virus majorly decline time vaccination effort really started. sure hasten plummet infection rates, done good work keeping down, it‚Äôs really hard tease moment.  Smokers death lottery.  

Heavy drinkers death lottery.  

Millions Americans engage risky behaviors completely unrelated COVID death lottery. 


If vaccine widely available adults vaccine authorization children pending (and they're far less likely suffer ill effects, let alone die it).... *why crisis?*  

**Eradicating COVID mandating human behavior NEVER goal. change?** Anecdotally think much hesitancy throughout programme. uptake region 70% across board, though I'd look there's discrepancy younger brackets. sure single digit percentile honestly waiting protein vaccine vast majority rejected that‚Äôs team.

That would guess well, human behavior pandemic surprised (mostly disappointing ways) fair amount. / Delta really gets going changes perceived risk / benefit 'hesitant' individuals, might perceived less 'rushed' option. Granted, based incredibly flawed, emotionally based reasoning; that's people operating on, could chance making inroads, depending 'marketed'. Exactly. sure, generalized form regard original comment apply all. mean, everyone's body different reacts differently. Pretty much everyone said get sick hell second shot mean protected. like think immune system chill really needed. like, I'm taught, I'm good, need show off. got you.

But seriously, myself, wife, friends, many people know severe reactions we're fairly young, near 30 so, healthy. Somehow think shit immune systems know? coworker mom covid. One long lasting symptoms smell meat makes want throw up. He‚Äôs vegetarian either. There‚Äôs actually online support groups symptoms has. body releasing stress hope inspired vaccine  Yes. need get high vaccination rate achieve that. what's wrong soon :'(  vaccine menu times, including seeing primary care provider provider health care setting,"" said. ""We done yet.""

I wonder possible. That's right, even wrong Alternative headline: 88% people eligible second shot received time even effective? people already buy lottery tickets, know winning lottery unlikely. 

On hand I've seen people almost anything free stuff. bet simply offering people $20 get shot would effective, probably cost same. Even case, hospitalizations get low enough people stop caring. Thats works Israel lot children antivaxxers. vaccinated rest population quickly though.   day 2nd dose Pfizer, work day? symptoms usually occur? following day work? OP delete, anyone afraid needles:

I too, time felt anything. took longer swab arm alcohol wipe took receive shot itself. easy forget years shot, like IV blood draw. Get Pfizer--it's tiny needle tiny amount fluid. told want see want told exactly happening.

I think us probably issue anticipation reality second minor pain. it. went someone felt ""accountable"" failed. also, walked Walgreens get it, little room see bunch needles everywhere like mass event.  wonder people going realize vaccines, extremely effective stopping death severe illness probably make us asymptomatic, since large portion population like kids, still eligible. endangering more.

I'm saying observed 40-50% high low given vaccinated percentage; that's hard determine due many factors play. pointing people might incorrectly assume figure implies vaccines 50-60% effective.  older age groups. saw exact percentages 60s UK. uptake younger age groups much lower

I think quotes misleading without stating age groups uptake rates in. vaccine escape stuff, think much differences delta variant. K417N escape antibodies polyclonal antibodies like vaccines risk tbh.Maybe delta plus additionally take E484K concerning. 56% fully vaccinated, clearly enough herd immunity Delta variant.

Restrictions vaccination reached higher levels. News: country 40% population 80+% 18s vaccinated, virus spreads reopen everything drop social distancing mask mandates. spreads especially fast schools places full unvaccinated people, makes bulk new cases.

Reddit conclusion: that's obvious evidence vaccines work. (?) They‚Äôre likely single vaccines. There‚Äôs conclusive data yet, feel safe assuming they‚Äôre fully vaccinated widespread infection small amount people either dying severe symptoms - particularly children.

By every virus mean Polio, Smallpox, HIV, Ebola, Measles, MERS, SARS...

Or mean Influenza? (in particular mild versions circulate nowadays) funny people want J&amp;J - quite get why.

Here Malta J&amp;J given undocumented immigrants. need show up, nobody ask paperwork, get shot done. means get even population vaccinated worry needing scheduled second shot. Doubt since I‚Äôm EU citizen. I‚Äôm permanent residency Denmark.  why?! smart idea travel domestically plane delta variant around even ur fully vaxed? (i live turkey) It‚Äôs kids. compromised suppressed immune systems lost hope quick herd immunity point. empowered health officials Wednesday quarantine anyone deemed exposed especially infectious variant COVID-19, even previously vaccinated recovered disease presumed 18 would odd? always known vaccinated people spread asymptomatically. still far less unvaccinated people. didn't, unless case data yet publish. get vaccinated, survive ""viral shedding""? Sounds good news channel promoting vaccine hesitancy? No. probably far (95? 98?) ‚Äú99.2 deaths unvaccinated‚Äù isn‚Äôt statistic.

To make simple demonstration why: back vaccine, 100% deaths unvaccinated. Said nothing effectiveness vaccine. city 100% people vaccinated, 0% deaths unvaccinated, course vaccine 99% effective anyway. 

Vaccine effectiveness death (simply put) many die vs number expected die (measured control group). (Expected - Actual)/Expected. 

This completely different ratio happens resemble percentage.   never claimed Norway EU. mentioned getting doses EU. clarification, J&amp;J AZ vaccines class flu vaccine. J&amp;J AZ viral vector vaccines (the viral DNA inserted envelope another virus) vs. flu vaccines inactivated vaccines.

Essentially, J&amp;J AZ puts secret plans spike protein cells says ‚Äúmake specific tool figure destroy it.‚Äù Flu vaccine says ‚ÄúI ran tool blender. shouldn‚Äôt dangerous, look anything similar.‚Äù

The viral vector vaccine specific mRNA, different delivery mechanism makes stable. Nothing new, known year now. think so? covid mRNA vaccines failed. also covid vaccines uncommonly high rate side effects. young people even side effects infection itself. 

They emergency vaccines, would chance regular circumstances. yes, apparently sadly data suggesting happens, found lot asymptomatic cases vaccinated people. Oh indeed need factor lockdown effects. 'few people' it? lots people.

In face emergent pathogen, already mutating become contagious harmful, responsible public health policy suppression - stop virus circulating. Yes, may include restrictions reached vaccine induced herd immunity.

If like restrictions, work us bring Covid minimal levels (like measles) over. vaccines = heavily loaded dice favour pretty much , shot = 20% chance end hospital ?  something related covid. , know odds im taking 5 five month old son seen grandparents yet live countries (we're Europe).

It's time wife get vaccinated soon still feel safe traveling son vaccinated while.

People refusing free vaccination deadly pandemic insanely [expletive] [expletive]. hope motivates people get vaccinated. vaccine easy way out. Israel doing? heard reinstated mask mandate. I‚Äôm kinda surprised. You‚Äôre vaccine rollout going well right? America we‚Äôre sort keeping tabs guys. mandate thing back? exemptions fully vaxxed?

[Idk valid article excuse accelerate every one indoor again. feel like studies looking vaccinated people. immunity previous infections. good numbers convince antivaxxers , seeing x chance get vs 15% Israel (vaccinated) might convince some. hope also learn adapt overcome Israelis too.

Single-handedly fighting good fight covid-deniers doomsayers claim pandemic never end surrounded sides Yup, virus continues mutate, thus creating new variants. could work together squelch thing all. something need fix.

Anti-vaxxers somehow need made understand *completely arbitrary* choice puts children sick people serious risk. 

It pisses whooping cough measles - two *deadly* diseases- reusurged country, COVID stick around mutate indefinitely. risk catching may still low, FUCKING ZERO.

It's matter time one completely preventable diseases morphs form longer responds vaccines treatments have, form deadly, - god forbid - both. Canada 4th July gonna party masks. Suck it!

They've always existed, we've always civic responsibility protect vaccinations. side effects nothing compared feels like Covid many. 2 brothers attest thinking going die infected. 30 40 people circle vaccinated minor arm soreness barely little fatigue 1 day. It‚Äôs even ballpark.

I heard anti-vaccine sister claim vaccine side effects terrible. hilarious trying tell us family gathering literally everyone except kids vaccinated.    No, point vaccine reduce community incidence disease. Vaccines don‚Äôt perfectly protect one person - it‚Äôs many people protected disease runs people infect, protecting whole community including people vaccine ineffective.

Once community numbers drop, they‚Äôre starting to, *then* safe gather again. vaccine alone make safe advisable.  I'm pretty comfortable without places, know certain places I'm likely come contact high risk people, like one example gave applies medical dispensary. require masks vaccinated patients, however ask still wear one know MAYBE person cancer severe disease. respect people. unvaccinated people elsewhere go want walk around without mask...I really respect least wearing mask they're going get vaccinated. pretty clear respect people can't least wear mask store policy instead ""oh jerk even asking"" can‚Äôt vaccinate medical reasons didn‚Äôt make choice. can‚Äôt force people vaccinated, instead coworkers family autoimmune disorders keep dealing since freedoms worth less pro-diseasers.

That said.... get vaccinated. don't, yoy qre fucking moron. I‚Äôm vaxxed longer give fuck That's problem. second dose necessary dramatically reduce ability spread virus. need get 70 percent fully vaccinated. 1 month leave, sounds generous actually. Usually don‚Äôt give us much time flee. 100% people vaccinated, even efficacy 99.99%, 100% cases fully vaccinated people. Oh that's much bullshit. even catch said it. Yeah. feeling. vaccine happens cause issue later, don‚Äôt believe, it‚Äôs worth, least contributed keeping others safe.

Covid another thing constantly worry immunocompromosed person like illnesses. Keep mind 85% country vaccinated 15% aren‚Äôt, 15% unvaccinated make HALF CASES, vaccines work, statistic taken comforting scary depending it‚Äôs presented. even said, seriously doubt see huge return mask mandates US. least entire region (the South) probably more. Vaccines always ""the way out"". heard times radio,tv, even sub times count. exit strategy always said vaccine thought.

Oh, *know* mainstream media focus *that* aspect variant. also may wanna check Five reasons COVID herd immunity probably impossible Murphy going use justification reimplement masks *soon,* say. appreciate response. fiance booked trip Disney vaccinated hardly masks. I'm reading poor immune responses steroids definitely nervous.

Praying best planning worst guess. sure do! Gonna get tested land suppose. ""plus"" side delta variant, appears give survive strong anti bodies. Dehli, example, basically recording lowest cases ever pandemic, read report estimated 70-80% citizens Dehli covid antibodies now. Fellow NJ user here, definitely within one month, most. Likely within 2 weeks.   caution? Israel always overcautious comes restrictions. There's reason they've done pretty well. also significant majority population fully vaccinated since believe approved vaccines 20, COVID mostly spreading schools among teenagers. evidence aren't¬ø otherwise, prevention seems way go. lives with, mother brainwashed allergic vaccines‚Ä¶.

Can‚Äôt write stuff tried.

My wife figure one day vaccines fine, hopefully hard way. mother law, she‚Äôs lost cause. Realistically long think it'll take Israel removes indoor masking again?  take methotrexate, I've read blunt vaccine. think I've read people doctors delayed methotrexate doses prior vaccinated, could wrong? try get antibody test.  Somebody needs tell dang states agencies/companies. I'm NJ resident too. Things definitely looking good.

Can't say I'm exactly surprised. NJ one last states lifted indoor mask mandate vaccinated people (only Hawaii slower). probably optimistic Murphy finally made announcement, though; expect hear make announcement masks required indoor settings people within one month tops.

I guess way personal psychology works. nature, think I'm big risk-taker; like see what's coming loathe surprises. so, setting expectations future high, I'm avoiding trap setting failure ensuring I've set ""safety net"" sorts case worst end occurring. Every life comes death sentence.  viral load passed vaccinated person unvaccinated person significantly lower, meaning unvaccinated person sick contracted covid fellow unvaccinated person? Depends much he's willing risk political career, he's able strike balance public safety/maintaining good approval rating.

But could see indoor mask mandates coming back, otherwise state mostly ""normal."" Ah ok, gotcha. feel you. =) Oh man you‚Äôre right. reason never thought way. found interesting ‚Äúwow finally many people vaccinated!‚Äù (I‚Äôm US) quickly went back ‚Äúman we‚Äôre fucked again‚Äù like..excuse what? we‚Äôve waiting on..what want exactly? done good thing, world needs people like you. 

if like renter, might want consider drawing line end June ""starting over"" $0. 

otherwise, nothing feel bad evict August. Darwin immunosuppressants elevated risk bad reactions vaccine. Virtually everyone immunosuppressants safely take vaccine. much less likely result effective immunity them. We‚Äôll get herd immunity hard way. people never get vaccinated matter what. longer keep restrictions place, longer take get there. Let‚Äôs rip bandaid get quickly life return normal. no.. screw that.. less dangerous overall percentage outcomes? Sure math works out. I'm sure take comfort fact ordering tombstone happen 1%.

At point increase danger child convenience others. 1% small 0% people going say living fear. OK take bag 100 M&amp;Ms replace one identical looking piece poison. Ask they'll let children take one candy bag eat they'll wait bag 0 poison it.  1% all.

People hiding behind math ridiculous. mentality ""acceptable losses"" war. Risk needs measured context value outcome.  biggest value people inconvenienced, 1% way high. That's entirely true; zero cases (other occasional imported one) entirely possible every person country (child adult) vaccinated high efficacy mRNA vaccine (assuming available children 12). That's science says. different eliminating measles (far infectious COVID ever be). entirely feasible. 

But again, decision mandate vaccinations (the way get everyone vaccinated) normative one - one almost certainly happen. regardless, science-based decision. Science tell likely outcome policy decision (with varying degrees confidence intervals outcome depending known available data). decision mandate masks vaccines capacity restrictions - - purely political societal. Delta variant seems like one jab enough. Yeah people afraid vaccine side effect compared suffering, long term damage death disease. Actually said Delta variant affect young children Fox news gonna immunocompromised people cases. dad waiting Novavax feels comfortable technology. hope get vaccination bump approved. now, when?

Let‚Äôs say reinstate mask mandates? get rid it? Every adult wants vaccine get vaccine. mask mandates re-instated, people wearing mask people vaccinated, they‚Äôre spreading COVID anyways. unvaxxed continue go public without mask despite mandates due lax enforcement (and think now, month without mandates, there‚Äôs even less appetite enforcement). Putting mask mandates back place accomplish nothing.

If mask mandates re-instated, I‚Äôll begrudgingly wear mask, I‚Äôm sick tired protecting people don‚Äôt want protect themselves. Why? thought 1st country fully vax everyone  shit it‚Äôs vax vax vax give fuck still wear masks, distance stay home enjoy life.

Fuck people 31 breakthrough cases fully vaccinated reported. 
They seem count cases partially vaccinated. Agreed mate. think US would one fat loser put mask way back March 2020   Yea listen scientists man lol Because‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.it America part? What‚Äôs shit ass fear mongering headline lol  someone told 90% USA get vaccinated, fall, I‚Äôd consider worth wait

I wonder Norway would nice visit fall? Assuming lift visitor restrictions son 10. lot complications early 2020 bout ""flu."" scary time want child parent go that. kids vaccinated yet. rest household fully vaccinated, still wear masks lessen risk 10 year old. need still protect little ones. still get sick sometimes bad. feels people family high risk gotten shots. gotten shots. without shots, person likely asymptomatic anyway. many us greatly protected virus posed small threat. Time move along people. Numbers inflated. many times you‚Äôll need proven wrong? Well done Norway. I‚Äôm going limb I‚Äôm guessing Murdoch media presence there.  OK that's valid. still believe explore hypothesis regardless political views though. welcome! Moving goalposts again. 

I remember started, two weeks flatten curve. curve never flattened, continue restrictions masks, fine with. keep healthcare system getting overwhelmed. healthcare system getting overwhelmed, continue restrictions masks, fine with.

Now curve like drop cliff, hospitals nowhere close capacity. goalposts now? Zero COVID? That‚Äôs never going happen. children, immunocompromised people, people worried short development time vaccines opposed vaccines general, people outright science-denying antivaxxers. think say anything conclusive population acts whole.

--------------------

To absolutely clear, I'm arguing imply B. I'm saying B necessarily false. speculating implies. pure logical deduction.

\* = 40-50% patients vaccinated

\* B = vaccines 50-60% efficacy This. adored father law. would drop hat go cross country help him. solid advice. met lady cool. They're widows. lived together 5 years, clearly love other. Theeeeen trump. 

I refuse visit anymore. last trip broke camels back. Everything conspiracy, immmigrants bad, legal - face, I, son's immigrant wife in-law immigrant - rapists criminals. Black people, whuff. get started lazy SOB's. Women belong home kids, three trump flags, Biden stole presidency, Newsmax/Fox-stravaganza. Everything checked back snd like it, leave house tell like is. Trump opened eyes. 

I call say ""Hey, Mr Mothra's hospital. Infection foot, took toes"" earful somehow Biden responsible. I'm blame that's another story. allll he's diabetic can't afford insulin ration it/get Walmart insulin. went outside bare feet bandage open wound hopped pool. he's, know, dribbler toilet dead night realize turn lights etc etc. 

I visited mr Mothra hospital. Said sure, all, way hell going might want think apologizing. 

Nope. 

I got call talking happened Trump presidency stolen ten minutes telling spouse take insulin. listen doctors. Listen him. 

Dude, no. want father law back. want man gave shit. made tea refused let clean. Asked doing. man tells job mother husband call rapist criminal go back country - Canada - shit working parent clients. 

I know relationship ever mended. wish could but, know need break them. recommended shots meeting new nephew. brother gave list promptly forgot it, it‚Äôs pretty standard. asked doctor‚Äôs office hit everything recommended around babies, drafted fuss all.

I still haven‚Äôt met nephew he‚Äôs another coast, we‚Äôre getting together October I‚Äôm already ready, minus possible renewal flu &amp; covid shots.  Can‚Äôt legally emergency-only approved vaccine. player‚Äôs union skimmed study seems show little evidence Ivermectin efficacy. 12 people treated looked like 40 endpoints, one different placebo. say warrants study I‚Äôm convinced treatment anything seen. Well enough adults got shot, maybe kids would protected. virus still rampant mah freedoms are. combination hubris, year wildly destructive propaganda leadership, places obvious tying reopening vaccination rates. Every governor mayor required state hit 70% vaccinated reopen. 

We could herd immunity America America. It‚Äôs hot eight known variants, thwarted vaccines. need like Israel response covid vaccine cases decline pretty much nationwide according CDC.

I'm pro lockdown, pro mask pro distancing vaccine made freely available public. 

After that, health longer responsibility. I'm vaccinated. me, over. able vaccinated choose to, care die. Better ignore facts amirite Check post history, they‚Äôre anti vax calling fauci communist. smell mile away vaxx must effective bragging says  R0 6, 90% effective vaccine, need 83.33% effective immunity herd immunity, requires .8333/.9 \~ 93% vaccinated equivalently immune. Given politics Israel lack approval children age 12, feasible without lot people getting immunity hard way. true rest world. Even approval 12s, places world much 7% anti-vaxxers.

One significant infectiousness increasing mutation likely render current crop vaccines completely incapable achieving herd immunity. 81% safe. Oof. Yeah. embarrassed. 

Good point though, everyone‚Äôs version ‚Äúcareful‚Äù different version careful may line consider careful. 

My MIL provided daily childcare grandkid, attending person school throughout ordeal. generous - completely disqualifying contact children without *actually* quarantining two weeks. threw fit blamed taking grand babies away her. 

I get it. It‚Äôs tough. showed you‚Äôd choose selfish safety kids, we‚Äôre page. What's greater risk/negative... kid potentially getting sick COVID, connecting/bonding family? ...so? Good. Trump gone  kids, take it.

We still mask park. oldest respiratory issues won‚Äôt take chances respiratory disease eligible vaxx

It‚Äôs sucks seeing many people give shit. literally shows nobody cares health us. Tough lesson learn six years old. lack empathy altruism total downer. One dad‚Äôs best friends paraplegic polio, mom vividly remembers quarantined month (notice door, food delivered Milwaukee) contracting Mumps. 

I think there‚Äôs definite correlation people know directly indirectly vaccine available. 

It‚Äôs shame people don‚Äôt step protect others around can‚Äôt get vaccinated (be immunocompromised, immunosuppressed, chemotherapy, young natural immunity). Ah like people happy long they‚Äôre better average family average family isn‚Äôt great. That‚Äôs horrible way live life terrible attitude have. 

But believe theory makes sense valid think it. Ahh ok. confused first. Thanks clarification.  ""Unvaccinated bubbles"" common even Israel nearly every adult vaccinated: that's basically everyone 16. Hopefully they're getting serious vaccinating 12-15 year olds, help, Delta sufficiently infectious, possibly vaccinating children 12 well get population vaccination rate high enough.   102.2 temp, lingered 2 days. Oh well. Happily vaccinated! Ameba blog good community.Antivaxx japan gathers there.

(There sane people too)

As health professionals,I know,and currently idea why.there known bad actors. Gee party would putting disinformation....hmmm wonder. I'm making claim. I'm asking evidence supporting claim asymptomatic vaccinated people spread disease. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  he's not, got despite living him, that's upside! Social media would draw conclusions. COVID manifests many ways there'll huge amount confounding factors anecdotes easily skew public opinion.

I'll wait wide scale, double blind study demonstrates effectiveness. Source? I'm asking evidence supporting asymptomatic spread among vaccinated. asking days now. millions unvaccinated US well. I'm losing sleep it, get people US vaccinated, well might mutate breakthrough vaccine. want worry it, that's okay, understand possibility. state reimplements mask mandates, I'll wear one, regardless whether I'm vaccinated not. Death lottery = good   
Death Panel = bad   
Do right? *Willfully* ignorant. information there. choosing ignore it. Hard feel bad folks. Nah, look UK data. mRNA vaccines highly effective preventing Delta infection *entirely* -79%. US almost exclusively uses mRNA vaccines.
 
They‚Äôre woods. screw up, it‚Äôs fault due high level vaccine hesitancy. require law, like Israel did? do, too.  vaccinated?

Then no. 

Are not?

Then get vaccinated. Yes course. Even 10% shift symptomatic vaccinated cases means people could potentially spread virus bunch unvaccinated kids. really numbers game. long run much issue since immunity go population. Including pediatric vaccines within months (hopefully). many actually covid deaths? one dies cause now. see /s tag really hope communities low vaccination rate wake call get vaccinated friends family start dropping Delta. many stories ""I regret taking seriously"" virus hits close home. mrna vaccines worked 30 years

Thank proving right ever before. MRNA vaccines worked 30 years tested thousands people seen long-term effects people not. That's perfectly suit well science. That's great.

This people cannot trust vaccine invented within 15 months. Nobody knows real long effects are, since made within 15 months.

Who took covid19 vaccine 5 years ago, assess long term effects right now? Nobody, exactly.

That's proving right example.

Yes, faced slavery white people, took rights shot us, they're still killing us right front whole world pushing knees throats. think, we're afraid die covid mortality rate %0,3? Hahahahaha, please. Try again. 

Never wore mask, never got lock-down, parties every day past 1,5 years yet, less death per person compared California full lock-down almost year.

Numbers never lie baby. quarantine, full mask yet, 3 times dead covid Florida lmao. guys also much better low vaccinated neighbours (argentina, paraguay) r/murderedbywords  Well, CDC disagrees this. There's hedging, spreading. Half new Covid cases vaccinated country world among vaccinated people. asking questions....like Glenn Beck! kid, kid. 

I think something killed like 620,000 people country alone, stop it? Easily? makes pretty damn horrible. Kind makes complicant murder, imo.

I mean, also opinion kill someone anthrax pretty terrible. that......really opinion?

And totally difference spreading virus regards vaccination status. somehow manage spread vaccinated, that's innocent mistake. unlikely innocent mistake.

If refuse get vaccinated....you're making innocent mistake. getting pay for. Intentionally. However, Novavax vaccine mRNA also achieves 90%+ efficacy. Still 90%+ efficacy two shots. Whether suggest wear masks irrelevant; people resume wearing them. They're it. vaccinated safe unvaccinated care worried. unfortunate, health issues precluding vaccinated caught crossfire here...those category need continue staying public indoor spaces and/or wearing masks. That's opinion man  Compassion fellow man? people ignorant, bad people. Yes, do. one example posted negate amazing work done since creation 1948...

[Such Eradication Smallpox*

*The near Eradication polio*

*The development vaccine ebola*

No, one example getting something wrong mean they, organization, wrong time trusted.

Edit: suck formatting. testing covid cases January 2020. That's thing. I‚Äôm really fucking tired argument doesn‚Äôt leg stand comes empirical research. People debate efficacy masks asymptomatic transfer willfully choosing ignorant. doesnt matter someone BELIEVES. There‚Äôs things KNOW. [Here‚Äôs study 2017 medical masks work healthcare [this specifically regards medical masks COVID [and here‚Äôs study differences cloth medical 

All points knowledge we‚Äôve held decades. Medical masks used operating rooms ages. Why? prevent spreading airborne infection could carried surgeon‚Äôs staff. *Even personnel asymptomatic,* (as one later question asks) asymptomatic carriers *still* carriers. There‚Äôs still contagiousness - true influenza tuberculosis.  It‚Äôs reference Big Lebowski  live US anything worry about? bring believes UFOs?

Many people former presidents, nuclear physicists, highly trained military personnel, doctors, lawyers, educated individuals believe UFOs. vaccinated people *can* transmit it, likely. 

Therefore, fully vaxxed people wearing masks probably make much impact, simply enough transmission first place.

However, they're area vaccinated people, even one transmission start outbreak, probably better cases start rising, imo. I'm scientist though.

Oh, think includes data Delta variant, understanding vaccines still effective. No, I'm questioning I'd actually noticeably protected got vaccine. Obviously vaccines effective protecting COVID. amazing majority reddit says follow science get downvoted oblivion legitimate questions. That's fundamental part science.   mean go back test samples Barcelona's sewage Jan. 2019 found COVID-19 them? It‚Äôs already circulating wide scale... new cases US slowed crawl keep plummeting. tweet say actually milder vaccinated population? double check that? vaccination occur least 3 months negativization virus? (I know USA rules specifically). countries let COVID healed people one dose, USA made step yet. myocarditis cases happen second dose. (5‚Äì6x frequent first age range) felt sorry kids workplace today. group 45 second third graders local Baptist school plus chaperones. One mask anyone group building 2,100 people today.

And rule, exception. 

My half dozen staff stay masked even though we‚Äôre vaccinated locals won‚Äôt anything protect people.

Especially since know someone similar place fully vaccinated since April, quit masking per local government guidelines, cold symptoms two weeks ago, got tested, covid. Luckily didn‚Äôt infect niece visiting. Darwin's theory evolution play major spike protein mutation reason believe vaccine won‚Äôt effective new variants. travel. many us spouse families countries. arre LGBT like me, many times either home country country work recognize partner. either sacrifice career chance relationships. shot work u care individual seems fine yet? Sort surprising also sort not. case numbers seem really increasing, least much; new cases already isolation. guess they're concerned types exposure sites time windows identified last two days - multiple days potential exposure busy venues. It'll interesting see lockdown limited size works, least hope does, cause I'm living it. know Sydney well, geographical extent lockdown, covering 550,000 people, 10% city's population: Thank much! Perhaps officials caught later. Scientists motivated publish. politics sometimes get way. "
