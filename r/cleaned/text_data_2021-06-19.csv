Living vaccinated, covid become minimal factor live life, thanks adult vaccination rate 70%. anti-vax folks areas country well, go fuck yourselves. Don’t stupid. It’s whether wants try another kid miscarriage. Flu going back. established animal reservoir hosts come contact regularly, multiple circulating strains without much overlapping immunity. Better vaccines works using mRNA technology, then, get flu shot fall. Yes, feel UK. invest less less state education blame people “stupid”. vaccines dont growing evidence virus does. doctors administer data support safe. Sure could go somewhere tell them, I'm super comfortable going medical advice either. think restrictions coming back unlikely. also vaccines built natural immunity. Via blackberry Yup, rest America going getting back normal south/midwest going decent outbreaks around November. It’s earlier. It’s making sure actually need get good time. note healthy 25 year olds getting know someone pregnant, 60+ year olds gotten them. Spain done fantastic job without Germany. Hence death rate lower Germany. Even though basically everything open widespread rapid testing. would ever thought Spain would efficient Germany. Colds back.

Meanwhile third (and biggest) wave Russia, majority population antivaxxers :) never even gonna get close herd immunity shitty country we’re going start testing anyone doesn’t feel 100% given day now? going rapidly devolve state paranoia symptom COVID.

Wow. RAPID growth mean, data Chile Latin American countries says Sinopharm indeed protect well severe disease death, got much problem Sinopharm (sure, Biontech et al much better, pandemic can't afford picky), however packing stadium 60k maskless fans definitely seem like best idea. UK also original guidelines, would shocked allow it. may able get moderna still? know moderna higher efficacy delta Windsor 8th

Depends got dose 1 - schedule accelerated past days. it’s a…variant? So, worst, you’d get mild cold/flu like symptoms. consider benefits outside pure health ones? worry rest society going vaxxed back normal schools still full restrictions, classes isolate, etc. point sympathy true anti-vaxxers (not people can’t get vaccinated medical reasons). it’s body choice, ready suffer consequences. excuse get vaccinated anymore, it’s easy widely available. get sick, it’s fault. allowed 60k fans stadium, least fully vaccinated Sinopharm. iron lung pictures made Hollywood basement, like pictures moon! /s Yes. remember lining grade school gym get Salk vaccine. talk back vaccines giving autism shit.

The fact dominant Delta strain vaccination rate would 90% combined restrictions. New-Brunswick minimum 28 days "" may die covid, I'd rather die actually living.""

Or could... get vaccination die actually live? Lol    Tl;dr: Delta (Indian) variant acquired immune escape mutation Beta (South African) variant, means could effectively cause reinfection evade vaccines, studies needed confirm effect. vaccinations coming along?

Pretty good. We’ve hit 30% population one dose 40% adult population one dose.

We starting hit around 1.5M doses applied every weekday, first doses. expect (and hope) death numbers start dropping next month reflex much we’re vaccinating month. want surge? Start charging vaccines let known limited supplies.. People start queuing I'm one them. Stupid J&amp;J vaccine. thought right got vaccinated soon possible sit around worry constantly providing adequate protection. Yes, yes, know, protect hospitalization death, there's data regarding efficacy delta variant data points one dose virtually vaccine inadequate. shld way round antivaxxers charged capital offences. Time hit morons hard  8 weeks province Quebec. Covid CFR SARS, bet EU would keeping out, locking everything gone, questions asked.

It's whether can, whether *choose*. couple hundred million doses go knew communist conspiracy. pointing serious physical symptoms manifest mind &amp; virus affects never intense amount attention COVID-19 has. know post viral syndrome already exists many diseases hardly surprising seeing COVID also. common seem well known. guarantee COVID, would long COVID symptoms due health anxiety. saying everyone long COVID experiencing psychosomatic illness doubt are. Why? Exponential growth among unvaccinated bound happen point anyway, especially reopenings young people (which getting vaccinated now) starting socialize again. I'm happy you!  mean 60% AZ? referring hospitalization only, referring Well duh, it’s 100% people get infected. question is.. die?  think unless comfortable forcing normalcy mass covid outbreaks .

Bradenton's one notable business, Spud Nuts, located across street PD. upon time, long long ago, galaxy far far away. anyone else worried restrictions coming back U.S. states due Delta variant? I’m fully vaccinated I’m really worried getting sick, I’m afraid could possibly see certain states reimpose mask mandates, capacity limits, etc. cases rise again, would real bummer life normal wonderful past month (for least). Anyone else think might happen irrational? No, really terrible health insurance. last year April/May (COVID?) saw cardiologist wear holter echo saw nothing wrong assume it’s inflammation immune response. hasn’t anything crazy heart rate 10 points higher now. crazy insomnia last two nights I’ve started sleeping again. spread others can’t get vaccinated last summer completely without vaccines much lower natural immunity. factors helping spread, together seasonality. Germany, France, Sweden, Norway Denmark among advising mixed vaccination schedules due reason. arent supposed drop whole fish mouth? lol Well rest simply shoot virus Chinese machine guns put ""Patriot"" sticker really wanted stop spread pain enforcement 

They would call every 2 hours check home, even night time apparently  Covid seems seasonal. Few, any, countries EU saw significant spread last summer.

The risk mainly get worse Fall comes, also means time vaccinate. Time retire old man.  Forgot add must special time frame think 6 8 months need 2 shots  none. Got it.  mine tues! mixing matching baybeeeee No. course not.

Deliveries problem many countries still, Spain example spread delta UK makes clear we're position time. permitted hundreds flights area delta variant, resulted specific hotspots UK (parts Glasgow, parts Midlands, etc.). hotspots gradually grew outwards.

The speed delta replaced alpha (about 4-6 week) incredible shows well seeded new variant was. think real issue UK much focusing single dose (although always doubts that), sticking strict age requirement vaccines even 40s.

If want achieve something resembling herd immunity, 90% 40s vaccinated 40s going vaccine much worse having, say, uptake 60% among over40s 40% among under40s. That's social contacts usually happen people bubble. ZOE study info, look graph 1 2 here:  Ask President? account BNT delivery less next month?

Hopefully works well offers something Pfizer Moderna.

However present domestic Australian mRNA production capacity Got vaccination letter yesterday Netherlands, said thing. (Having COVID meaning need one vaccine) Yep that's what's happening. got first dose UK brother Italy, get second dose month earlier me. Nope Thing is, Sinopharm Sputnik-V were

1. approved without proper documentation (hell, case Sputnik even clinical trials completed time, data available fairly suspect, lots instances seemed copy-pasting...);
2. approved without proper examination EU authorities, lacking/sped examination local authorities - case Sputnik approval process sped superficial, case Sinopharm *skipped altogether* basically made law would approved;
3. acquired ways maximize corruption (especially case Sinopharm fairly well-documented);
4. pushed people despite well-documented effective Western vaccines also available;
5. pushed people without regards little documentation available, see again: Sinopharm used widely elderly, despite existing documentation stating elderly target demo vaccine - result, millions people vaccinated Sinopharm may safe *whatsoever,* ticking time bomb. Many people received Sinopharm tested antibodies found *none.* Zero. Nada. learning this, gov't-led authorities basically like ""oh shut up"".

The vaccination program Hungary nothing safety efficacy. Orbán basically using it, entire pandemic, way pushing propaganda, proving ""win"" nonexistent vaccination competition despite obstacles set us evil EU (who supposedly sending vaccines, except *were*), domestic opposition (for ""anti-vaccine"" even though thing spoke using Russian/Chinese vaccines properly examined/documented), extolling wisdom trusting ""Eastern friends"" (Putin/Xi) eager help ""the West"" hurting us, forth.

Those Chinese vaccines efficiency 50-78% slightly higher prevent hospital stays. good enough still spread disease half time.

Why would ever use better vaccines available?

Why would allow vaccinated people still spread COVID give still unvaccinated citizens?

The Chinese vaccines good nothing else - bad, man.  Well daily deaths UK haven’t 30 last two months. think it’s combination strict step wise system lowering age restrictions well longer wait time first second dose ensure everyone gets least one jab quickly possible. Sadly latter comes back bite us ass delta variant.

Whether UK gonna worse Germany month largely depends getting variant control. Vaccinations open everyone since last Friday 80% adult population already received least one jab. probably maximum percentage ever get jab Germany due much larger amount anti-vax idiots (looking Stuttgart)

There's good data showing pretty effective variants, too, could mean difference Covid last November getting again. Israel extremely low population.. really care well (no offense).

What care is:

(1) Vaccines 100% effective. Although unlikely, still get covid vaccinated. people vaccinated, lower chance breakthrough infection.

(2) many people vaccinated immunocompromised due illness medication (immunosuppressants). vaccines less effective cases, effective all. vaccination status directly affects people

(3) people cannot get fully vaccinated (for example, kids 12) medical reasons (for example, someone got first mRNA shot allergic can't get second). 

(4) spread among unvaccinated people = variants, affects us all. 2019 traffic, would mean plane would need carry average 102 passengers day. Completely feasible considering 1) planes fly 1 route day depending route 2) Even A319s older 737s higher capacity.

Thanks answer. Jesus! leftists outmaneuvered 101 million vaccinated, 10,000 documented breakthrough cases. quarter cases asymptomatic. didn’t start first ones Oh!  vaccinated people transmit virus . Yes partially poor immune systems. people win care.

Now, $50 gift card everyone might work. think California. rumor, I've even heard 3rd plane world. That’s roll, that’s chopped raw fish. Grey's vacine hesitant etc.

Finally 50% UK variant well, yet came US hardly made dent falling case numbers. 

Vaccines powerful. claim made people shouldn’t become fully vaccinated ASAP.

It’s data based response claim delta variant result halting loosening restrictions.

The mRNA vaccines smash . delta variant pandemic Canada . grows likely. Anyway expected like 45% Pfizer now. haven’t haircut since March last year 🙃 Right I'd imagine high rate vaccines making R(t) strains 1. NY vaxxed. 

Yes, two doses. 

Also, matter fully vaccinated person goes gets haircut. Give barbers business. Everyone start able go soon anyway, anything prevent run barbers making impossible get appointment within month. Novavax trial participant US here. also similar situation you, got J&amp;J dose little month ago. problems me. People keep saying won’t hit herd immunity, think reach it!

This could scene horror movie. Canada Europe socialist. free market economies strong welfare systems. social democracies. That's socialism. link actual study? article gives actual information. shitty (and misleading) breakthrough numbers something? EU's rhetoric bordering anti-vax! Sinopharm approved WHO. works. Remarkably, reuse planes they've flown. Orbán's communication basically (""we"") ""won"" virus also fighting EU sending enough western vaccines (not true, pretty much swimming Pfizer got approved) opposition spreading anti-vaxx propaganda (they didn't, speaking using Sputnik &amp; Sinopharm despite insufficient data approved EU). even talked ""East"" (=Russia &amp; China) sent us help ""West"" sent criticism obstacles (that pesky thing rule law, see).

And yeah, political motivations. used entire pandemic situation political proposes, means corruption strengthening authoritarian power. :/ point 2 doses high protection, one dose not.

The person responded arguing good protection cited protection for.... two doses.

So person reading saying actively trying mislead people. made clear case understanding.

....and responded derogatory Office Space (great movie) clip. Wtf? Cold huh... Check comments people said sympathy people like sister die. least don’t wish death sister. free likely 70% adult population vaccinated end July

You’re aware global pandemic still raging parts world right? maple syrup 95% ready?  Half people Germany would readable imo. look it, there.

Or ""We know long vaccine good for... "". data say level natural immunity?

I’m particularly curious places low vaccination rates, like 30% range. communities never taken covid seriously never made serious efforts follow guidelines, given infectious virus reportedly high r0, can’t reasonably assume communities also high levels natural immunity letting super infectious virus circulate communities 1.5 years?

Also curious high vaccination prevalent communities like NYC, know also high infection rate thus high natural immunity rate. Combined high vaccination rates, isn’t pandemic effectively places? not, data shows far herd immunity places also factor natural immunity rates vaccination rates? isn’t data made public, isn’t comprehensive gauge collective immunity ever discussed talk far herd immunity, even studied even point interest experts?

Thanks. im fully vaccinated people. isnt business. Society reopened Anti Vaxxers suffer consequences. business happenes still choose get vaccinated so? also vaccination programs countries cannot afford important. Honestly, get rich countries bought doses first, that's running, health everyone planet; let's get *everyone* vaccinated.

We need reduce reservoir population covid. ASAP. Great. Can’t wait til next year, then. I’m Egyptian free healthcare isn’t best still sounds crazy whenever hear things like pay ambulance US tragically stupid people. There's good portion America irredeemably dumb. There's nothing learn hard way. guess obvious enough spell out. volunteer get vaccinated putting public risk mandatory job. Take advice rando. Obviously flex considering mates got infected, kinda shows vaccines work Okay, thanks help higher dose levels, vaccine caused many side effects, trial participants frequently complaining problems severe headaches, fatigue, chills injection-site pain.


Sounds like attempting make equally effective vaccine less side effects, thus keeping lower 2-20mG doses. side effects sound *just* like ones experienced Pfizer shots, would great able get rid them, think really demonstrates kick ass Covid presents body, even spike protein. 

I wonder able studied side effects related body producing spike protein, body fighting spike protein.  Check county’s website. There’s gotta something. It’s amazing two months ago, PA cases thousands. 

Now state gone two straight days sub two hundred cases, state around 250 cases day 7 day average. It’s averaging 2 cases per 100k daily now, deaths nose diving. Vaccinations going well too. 

I’m proud home state went one highest rates Covid infection whole country two months ago, one lowest! don’t need health insurance shot. can’t tell ID necessary, imagine record keeping requirement. would call ahead sites check also ton resources linked sticky post thread FAQ vaccine questions. You’re right thing get vaccinated! I've seen little real deniers.

And problem; needing see something personally realize/admit happening.

""I've never seen it, can't real."" that's ignorant. get people like her... feelings valid CDC (as far I'm concerned I've seen website) reporting vaccines even kill people. 

Even deaths rare, publish possible side effects. me!  I’ll check, honestly didn’t know that’s thing. Tbh afraid get jab long time I’m loop. coming senses now. realise hard get head around

Nah, still bullshit.

If ignore worst cases favor thinking best cases happen, that's *choosing* ignorant. question anymore, evidence there. Stop making excuses idiots right-wingers. Wow. love hate it. also bullies people wear masks, wishes trump would become PM Canada whole bunch crap I’m even going get into

These people same. deny want true. Yes...woman died vac underlying conditions. county state vaccine sites around? proof address like rolling d20 really. crazy. don’t even know, last updated number started second doses 50% town 4000-4500 money employer pays health insurance part compensation, could pay money need worry health insurance.

The amount money employer pays health insurance expensive taxes universal system, IE would take home money universal heath care wage would increase taxes. go avoid that?  know concerns? uphill battle, tailoring messaging specific issues might help. Concerns speed development? Explain technology worked decade now, new. Concerned vaccine safety? Vaccine administered 2 billion times minimal side effects, scrutinized vaccine history, clearly less dangerous covid. Thinks covid worse flu? Explain even flu kill someone high risk factors, better safe sorry.

Either way, good luck. Cognitive dissonance strong, often folks would rather die admit mistake they've adopted core belief. anti vaxxers even brain tissue lose? easy solution would health insurance companies deny coverage person get medical treatment Covid aren’t vaccinated

Why don’t also push insurance guarantee coverage people may experience side effects taking vaccine? High school senior Emma Burkey received “one done” Johnson &amp; Johnson coronavirus vaccine March 20, within two weeks induced coma following seizures clotting making slow recovery, recently transfered hospital rehabilitation center, first round bills totaled $513,000. 18-year-old’s family friends Las Vegas area started GoFundMe account help medical expenses rare vaccine Burkey’s family can’t look J&amp;J cover medical costs picked insurance 2005 law—extended last year include COVID-19 pandemic—shields manufacturers health-care providers state federal liability instances public health bioterrorism government shield vaccine makers lability, insurance companies may need step guarantee protection compensation end huge medical bills direct result taking vaccine.

If argue insurance hook individuals fully liable bill, longer coerce bully people taking vaccine. tell alone responsible risk, accountable one regarding decision vaccinate. Unless you’re offering pay hospital bill things go south, valid opinion decision.

Note add child’s hospital bill half million dollars. even 5% people insists pushing everyone vaccinate throws dollar, bill covered already. Anyone urging vaccinate promote go fund immediately donate well. exactly what's going happen. Right now, climate protecting people, winter/fall season hits, whole ball game. I'm pleading pals get vaccinated, keep ignoring it. safety period likely giving ""see, nothing worry about, happened yet"" false sense security. 

God, people dumb. Ethics aside, many unvaccinated think Covid dangerous, unlikely deterrent.  That’s probably bill corporation bills government. It’s nice scheme. went 10 days ago 5 people pubs.

Pfizer said take 100 days develpp, test, produce booster variant pops up, one able substantially reduce efficacy exist vaccines (none can, right now). Additionally, variant would likely *not* knock efficacy zero something crazy like that.

This mean US need restrictions vaccinated (with boosters, needed) well protected.

Of course, things really bad pooorer countries unvaccinated people. fantasy world highly unlikely we'll ever get herd immunity. OG covid might chance Delta's spread high we'll keep small pockets unvaccinated getting infected, with, say, also breakthrough cases. It'll limited, keep happening, main thing needs considered impact low. healthcare system manage, like flu.

I get main concern variant resistant. However level vaccinations, highly unlikely happen country. actually worried might well buckle world vaccinated long time, never get sufficient percentage another variant come along. good thing variants escape vaccines incredibly rare according knowledgeable people. happens, apparently good chance virus unable things good first place, attaching humans. 

The reality going risk accept while. Sure, could wait 75% fully vaxxed, that, going do? Stay locked borders closed antivaxxers change mind reach herd immunity? Fantasy thinking best. open borders? still antivax neighbor south likely keep bringing cases long time.

What saying effectively lockdown next years, prolonging case something else comes around.

Live life, vaccines work perfectly fine hospitalization death. They're watertight, neither lot things life risk accept.

Even could, recommended time AZ shots 3 months, 2 AZ/Pfizer AZ/Moderna. Waiting extra month AZ/AZ appealing. Gotta love old ""take whatever vaccine offered first"" advice. One problems partial vaccinations, social distancing lockdowns selective pressures impede replication virus rather preventing it, thus tending select variants infectious and/or transmissible. first time human history species able operate concert, type policies vaccines used everywhere planet, we're still slow capacity vaccinate everyone one go, meaning virus floating around multiple partially vaccinated population groups.

Its going interesting see goes next 5-10 years. Meanwhile Alberta struggled get 70% first dose lol. Nah, chose get Pfizer instead lmao   actually pretty difficult reach herd immunity vaccines alone. Delta variant takes over, R0 value 5, means need 80% vaccinated (assuming 100% effectiveness). course, people obtain immunity contracting illness well. mean, exacctly hire football players academic critical thinking skills could still possibly transmit virus someone asymptomatically  know AZ/JJ don’t work well certain variants? know we?

I’m double jabbed, part done. Especially since definition “many” definition “a few”, especially since you’re describing generic post-viral infection syndrome symptoms. Even college educated Alabamans know getting vaccinated. Ebola recently found this. virus retreats immune exclusion zones (testicles, nose/sinus area, fluid space eye's), assumption recent ebola flair ups survivors past infections virus become active likely passed via sexual contact

that's terrifying. Ebola STD, evolves new disease transmissible deadly Please please please see doctor, prob fine weeks still go see health professional sequencing? sure that? Even people continue careless? hear latter often well. Probably regional difference  survival pressures equals viruses better surviving, called evolution think people think need get it. 24 hour news channels garbage. repeat ad nauseam.   I’m one 20% YAY idea got downvoted shared experience. Guess there’s vaccine fanboys there, bizarre me. Thank sharing. 🙏 Personal experience crucial others make truly informed decisions. Especially bad experience. hope sense taste &amp; smell gets back 100% ASAP. 👍 whole talk around fertility covid/vaccine giving ""children men"" vibes. movie even said new flu hit fertility tanked Especially came today offers Pfizer cheap rejected it. dies, debt still paid someone? talking sources I’m replying talking reputable vs rag journalists. rag journalist asks good question shouldn’t automatically get shat bc work for, example, pornhub. wapo reporter shouldn’t lauded idiotic questions. I’m trying get across think content exchange vastly important organization questioner works for.

What say give impression I’m looking confirm beliefs? I’m trying clear nature science questioning everything seeing proves out, using said information answer people’s questions subject. think it’s fucked people told ask questions, don’t know saying trust good scientific methodology contentious issue. Gravity mean thing severity. I'm still oxygen cognition still can't believe it. pillar health.

Unfortunately, one known less understood risks infected COVID-19 kind long-term ""brain Gravity meaning. Literally grave something is. That's talk gravity situation. mean physical force. ""big-time"" mistranslation even less idiomatic severity context. worries me. I'm 19 fit cyclist. Resting heart rate 40s, plant based diet etc etc. there's still teeny tiny chance covid could change ability ride bike, would destroy me.

Avoided far, damn seems like I'm lucky minority caught it.  Rest Peace Jason getting sick often lifestyle, genetics. Source: rarely get sick run marathons ""eat clean"". prescription drug since teenager late 90s. dad way. Covid19 real. mayhem isn't. Makes sense😑 agree. I'm hard pressed even remember nasty cold. describe healthy was.  😂😂😂  Technically, kind sure. ""experimental"" ""we sure safe"", experimental sense ""how time doses relate effectiveness"", ""how long immunity last"", ""what shelf life different storage conditions"", etc.

What streamlined types studies timing studies. example, [this Pfizer/BioNTech combined Phase I/II/III trial. one 26 vaccine trials Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine alone. also notice trial concluded, interim results shared regulatory agencies, Emergency Use Approvals based on. trials also focused limited number dosage regimens, dosages.

The safety vaccines par approved vaccine. Safety tested *first*. effective shown second. Phase IV would monitoring, would provide information *how* safe *how* effective. Also, rush would also tested different dosing regimens, storage conditions, etc.

So yes, experimental know *how* long immunity lasts, long spread two doses two dose shots, different dosages would effective, rarer problems. Phase IV right now, literally **100s millions** people vaccinated now. blood clots associated Oxford/Astra Zeneca vaccine discovered. occur 1 100,000 less, meaning rare unusual show trials.

Another example ""still experimental"" dosing regimen. example, Canada, chose focus giving people first doses rather fully vaccinating people. seems good gamble. Pfizer Moderna really test single dose effectiveness, choosing instead play safe, test one dosing regimen. Although participants removed dosing schedule one dose, providing information.

With respects ""still experimental"" sentiment, technically true, studies still showed *at least* safe enough *at least* effective enough consider approval. expert vaccine approval process (unless count Google Skool Lurning), understanding normal flow vaccine approval would involve completing small trials, submitting results, getting approvals next stage, slightly larger trials, submitting results approvals, etc. slowly building large Phase 3 trials. vaccines large larger trials, without steps results collated, submitted, approvals trials requested. Also consider even *have* interim results. Normally, trials would conclude, results would collated, submitted, reviewed.

---

To save anyone looking up, study linked example really testing one candidate Phase stage, BNT162b2 30µg 21 days doses. Would second dose 15µg effective? 28 days? effective? Less effective? sorts things *not* tested yet. that's tested BNT162b2 two 30µg doses 21 days apart **safe effective**.

There third dose fourth dose 5µg, 10µg 30µg eventually provided test ""boostability"". means trial fully conclude another year so. interim results show safety effectiveness one dosing regimen disease killing people *right now*, really make sense full approval? theory way patient breathes pulls virus deeper lungs. think lungs like broccoli, people use mostly stalk. Runners, singers, athletes general pull air florets little green spots. might way virus attaches crown. Air might dislodge float another spot. longer sits might mean longer replicate, see symptoms.

This theory known studies back up. mean? think anti-Vaxers obese something?

No means people got vaccine need double lung transplant won't... ya know... brink death needing double lung transplant? IDK got obese from. miss-translate? 

YUP. Big time. English word would ""severity"" (oh, thought *I* miss-translated something looking edit, funny lol) Australia confirmed multiple cases transmission less 10 seconds contact distance 30cm (walking past other), one outside.

Hope he's ok. triathlons too. marathon January 2020. prime shape Damn that’s rough. sounds like caught huge viral load due nature job constant exposure it. get mild symptoms probably got exposed briefly much manageable level. think it’s rather prior health.

Anyway, best recovery hope get help need going forward, lord knows deserve it. variants popped up. concern. sit around worry constantly providing adequate protection.

This something would advisable seek help, go away fairly quickly. Last summer mild preview what'll happen summer plutocrats open $pigot$ again. don’t wanna get specific part San Diego County.

Gravity? miss-translate? end article statement.. I'm familiar Sinopharm, WHO-approved?  many got reinfected?  
But 5G, magnetism, microchips kills 1%. 
Nothing else could possibly matter /ssss  mate mine less 50 would surf triathlon sorts fitness stuff. carpenter lunch would rock around lads would getting take away etc would pull salad etc eat that. Still right yr later. looking comment! mine dirty mind.      I've seen same, runners, people exercise regularly general. suspicion reason exercise presymptomatic peak viral shedding, drawing viral particles still primarily multiplying nasal cavity deep lungs process. also, many firefighters paramedics choosing get vaccinated. understand reasoning all. threat public safety. wtf ? many people hard time concept ""germ theory"" spread disease. accurately accepting ""germ theory"" disease entails.

Herd immunity concept even baffling cohort.

I tried explaining ""reservoir"" local forums entail (transmission, mutation, hiding spot re-emergence, etc.). Even understand herd immunity entails find idea reservoir difficult thing grasp far many willing grasp (especially immediate threat them).

One thing pandemic reinforced little trust place others. already allowed little.

A secondary thing little capacity people regard application logic confronted puzzle implications beyond merely themselves. come full circle term Viral Load. Yes, better enemy good. two approved mRNA vaccines prevent severe disease part also infection transmission. means places vaccinated vaccines reach herd immunity less 100% vaccination whereas Sinovac used can't.

It's still great give many people possible *any* vaccine quickly possible. still get booster later. Brazil tired normalise death think still long way go,"" Dr Natalia Pasternak Taschner, microbiologist Question Science Institute, told BBC.

 would comment more, virtually anything would get deleted viewed pollyticks. Yes. opinion, Sinovac unfairly written off. still great vaccine efficient preventing death hospitalization, matters much mostly developing countries used in. mRNA, better good vaccine perfect one later. Gotcha. match description minus marathons, wouldn’t say I’ve never sick day life.. cold without needing doctor’s intervention still sick indoor gamers immunosuppressed dad almost reaction covid vaccine, whereas active people much harder 2nd shot experience. think inferior immune system somehow doesnt trigger deadly response body won’t world live you’ll need figure manage fear  seems kind random. got doses vaccine side effects. would say kids, affected long covid well biggest problem kids face. compare polio also many deaths hit hard devastating. simply know enough make gamble kids affected. feels like healthy, active people much adverse reaction covid covid vaccine  You’re hero sacrificing health save take care others. know doesn’t help hope able recover fully. Covid would worse effevt I'm gonna call bullshit deformity autoimmune diseases. suffered getting vaccine asap. probably nicotine they're 100%sure yet

 need help  Good thing Covid hoax /sss wanted liberals fail.  agree based written. 

And still seem keen ""deny everything"" unless agree it. one trusting organization blindly, one automatically give credence opposing information obviously fully false. 

Case point conspiracy theorists: covid vaccine produced ""too fast"" realize vaccines produced even faster. told hate something clearly understand.   Sorry, American here, mean since recover bill (well, family), still 0? Anyone says “just weeks” unironically point pandemic hasn’t learned anything. suspect something like this. Smokers end ICU expect. stopped.smoking thx corona tastes like perfume. Exactly. Basically people hospitalized would died 100 years ago situation. oxygen = death lot people. 

COVID serious Spanish Flu imo, much better prepared sure In1918 countries good vaccine availability, likely so.

In rest world, nope. US, statistics doses administered vaccine type totals fully &amp; partially vaccinated able work backwards come approximate numbers people received 1 2 doses vaccine  Well fast promise something usually fails deliver. Tzechia still waiting promised 60.000 shots. Covid weirdest disease ever. feel thing, others death sentence.  Neither Nova Scotia. last phase reopening plan says “easing public health measures, living Covid,” vague gets.  guess would wrong. scientific information comes peer reviewed issues believing that.
I don’t issue source question though, science purely answering questions. don’t faith reporting agency itself, back claim verifiable scientific way truly matter claim presented White House pornhub enquirer? Good science stand own, bad science shouldn’t viewed credible purely whoever reporting it.

Don’t put trust organization blindly, follow real science never stop questioning risk going science faith. family friend whose daughter professional ballerina. 18, athletic, healthy diet. completely floored her, pretty close admitted started turn better home 2 weeks. high times essentially admitting people thought could die it, probably would've admitted ""normal"" hospital conditions. Canada vaccination graphs reminds Seabiscuit movie. describing herd immunity necessary concept, suboptimal manner went Texas Tennessee help staff depleted hospitals Amarillo. working 6 days 1. significantly lowered immune system probably hit hard. dunno.  pro-vax think ever see government requiring vaccines citizens across board. That's extreme position frankly something I've seen many suggesting. side feel extreme position prevent businesses schools requiring vaccines entry in-person activities, frankly that's much common. 

Personally see vaccine problem sorting insurance providers start pressuring employers require vaccinations least provide incentives. we'll see huge boost Pfizer Modera receive full FDA approval use power marketing provide information outreach holdouts. dont know lol. truly thought ""man anyone know gonna die covid, gotta her"". Yet trucked zero issues except mild cold symptoms. claims sense taste still gone. However, seems low price paid considering overall health. Yes, assuming well. Also, amount initially take in... tissue infect. Canada Europe socialized medicine. USA not. USA outperformed vaccine rollouts. I’m surprised.

What stupid that? Good! 🙌🏽  Well know, people need find something complain about.

I don’t need reward. got mine soon could January, would gladly paid it. I’d right now, regrets.

[Vaccine FAQ Part FAQ Part appointment bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Yeah, tell lizard brain. I've tried talk bunch never works. also something exchange fluids happens. make sense me. 45% fully vaxxed I’d hope.

That’s personally started stuff. first doses 2-3 weeks ago (March early June). started second doses recently. province 69% first doses, 7% second doses. Check us two weeks dude...

Things moving fast right now

That 20% number 50% like month; idea quantity scarce, 1st dose many vs 2 doses fewer worked well us, big mess recent two months ago. Numbers really flattened now, 2nd doses skyrocketing

It said last year Canada might first G7/G20 vaccinated, things trending supply demand standpoint, looking looking likely become true 

The US stagnated around 50% first dose mark month (52% right country anyone get one awhile now...). Canada face vaccine hesitancy too, like US could buy 2000 Walmart gift cards $500 value. bet would people lining up. “The source outbreak still investigation connection family returned recently abroad,” said update. Preliminary results genetic sequencing samples indicates children may infected highly contagious “Delta variant” first identified Oh, hell no. spent next two weeks complaining every day freaking ""hole"" arm.

It's going take quite able get another shot. would probably take another global pandemic convince should. banning Europe year fine.  communications aspect horrible countries start. something communicated confusing way, that's way (health authorities media) it. 

Let's put like this, none us getting information reddit. yet, probably #1 source info many us (because local sources thousand times worse).  Everyone Alberta eligible yesterday. I'm getting second shot Tuesday 3 days 30th birthday mean can't give cite? Might yoy.br mistaken then?  Yes understand thought process. Good Canada. silly way try compare countries' vaccine rates. goal full vaccination. Partial vaccination good step. countries value full vaccination more, partial. metric standardize policy choice shots per capita, Canada near top using metric. think lot sense Denmark truncating 50s. groups would 18-21 47-50 final group mid-thirties. high demand, think would've possible open once. USA got jump socialized medicine countries.

The US makes vaccines don't. countries limiting vaccine exports recently. bought lots vaccine get this. Conspiracy theorists say it’s Red Herring missing point story. great thing 75% Canadians received least one dose. Soon second dose number follow. know anyone received first dose decided skip second. Good job Canada! Day 9 second dose I’m still elevated heart rate pounding heart. think myocarditis risk definitely real people aware it. Still don’t regret know resolve. Oh, no! Anyways.... Delta gonna massacre people. It'll like holidays again. compare places like San Marino 37,000 people. mean can't reasonably saying ""why comparing city states G7/G20 countries millions people""

% population first dose Canada number 1, Israel number 2

In r/Ontario user gives thorough update ton metrics daily, including one host vaccination related metrics thank god Mississippi Exactly virus still around, crisis COVID basically Israel. People keep saying won’t hit herd immunity

Why? understanding UK recently changed strategy they're fully vaccinating 50s now. previous variants month Pfizer ones IIRC  Nah, bad, despite downvotes. translated increased deaths/hospitalizations signifigant way. case countries need ramp second doses administered.

That's we're doing.  eeesh yeah – remind Omega :((( Josh ""doing research"" guy still pathetic better screaming he's persecuted. 

As simple is, 100% competitive advantage. Looks like receiver core going signed increased protocols season end poorly. idea idea different lineages originated popular, really hold water. pick lineage see [it take one country state put timeline, see distances scale directly place extremely likely originated.

With Beta (somewhere near South Africa) Delta (somewhere near Mumbai) there's uncertainty, extreme lack sequencing. Alpha (London), Gamma (Manaus), B.1.526 (NYC), B.1.427 (LA), P.2 (Rio), and...the list goes on...there really none all.

I think basic misunderstanding leading thinking lot sequencing, like UK does, track lineages. not. Even 10-100 sequences week given area give really close confidence interval prevalence growth lineage area - matter many actual cases are. No, vaccines work. Deaths hospitalizations still way down. spread young unvaccinated crowd, get long term serious ailments anyway. Case numbers mean anything causes minor illness.

It apparently also symptoms common cold hay fever now. Now, I'm virologist, seems like good development, no? Polio threatening another wave 

Look get it, want over. went crowded tourist town today without mask first time long time felt great. I'm ruling possibility ""Variant insert"" evading vaccines mutates. J&amp;J used UK, know that's case. Haha they're actually not. bad.

Per capita doses ""standard"" arguable (OurWorldInData shows ""People vaccinated"" default). % vaccinated people also important metric, get protection vaccine offer first shot. first dose that's given going slow virus much subsequent second doses. I'm sure chart showing smaller countries better rates. Perhaps focused major world influencers. 

The standard metric nonetheless number shots per capita. I'm trying shit Canada anything, leading world sense. I'm glad they've gotten lot first shots in. I'm hotspot, know Toronto area Windsor 8th got Moderna May 14th, tried calling day get 2nd, gave health card #, said eligible yet, people May 8th.

Where located? provinces opening second doses everyone next week! opened anyone got first shot May 15 yesterday, may want check again. Also, Quebec give one dose already covid. cancel second dose. guess polio isn’t metric spreads places world, mutates. I'm saying lock room. Go enjoy sun, eat patio. I'm saying, places. specific countries world Thing is, island country says vaccines approved count 'fully vaccinated', since state mixing vaccine brands allowed person considered unvaccinated quarantine 5 days.

Oh damn. us getting mixed brands. mostly Pfizer we're getting less Pfizer lot Moderna, lot people got Pfizer first shot getting Moderna second shot. guess countries allow us then, they? local government seems fishy me. Yup, point. /u/Wacov seems correct metric: . Top countries least one dose: Canada, Israel, UK, US. Josh Allen antivax guy too? could mistaken, thought said get either.

That's want take afce back. know Miami coach Flo bring medical professionals speak team vaccines. left grown men make informed decisions. result, Miami reached benchmark vaccinations protocol relaxed.

IMO, that's competitive advantage. Per Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) used collect reports adverse events vaccination general public. primarily used identify potential topics investigate regards vaccine reactions. However, event data VAERS often verified often self-reported, assumed adverse events VAERS actually associated cause vaccines, possible estimate frequency adverse events data.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* anti-vaxxers linking reports (thousands of) spontaneous abortions Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). course, millions people getting vaccine one might naturally expect random chance (and without connection vaccines) thousands miscarriages occur shortly vaccination.

I really appreciate study links. suspect misleading anti-vaccination propaganda. latest nonsense making rounds Facebook vaccines “are Brain Poison” causing people feel anxiety.

Of course people anxious getting vaccinated. anxious vaccination well.  possible UK danger again? symptom society I'm sure getting downvoted saying this. disagree whatever reason. government stated. Here's [the virus manipulated version vaccine. plan getting Pfizer one though. help keep wife safe. got virus bad! I'm glad got vaccine one scariest things life seeing go throught not. 

In event, per capita doses standard metric. Singapore reports efficacy know many cases Delta know vaccines had, interesting I'm Bills fan embarrassing point. 

They option get vaccinated also get deal consequences it, seems fair! 

I'm actually surprised Jordan Poyer, whose supermodel wife vocal anti vaxxer. plummeted locked [cases spiking bad hospitals talking started opening up. UK fine locked saw rise cases 2 weeks opened up. Isnt approval expected around July? Sorry happened though- Bureaucracy worst One reason approved fast never see talked much pandemic ""best"" time efficacy trials. wait enough people exposed/infected compare vaccine group placebo group. COVID virulent reached point relatively quickly. Source: Johns Hopkins website know young people tend work riskier jobs right? can't work home. often choice expose virus.  Yes, area China deal work same. one lock last year it. know sure always contact them. Chinese new year year full blown again. Yeah, beats shit Facebook electric car.  Canada following (as call them) UK protocols—- give everyone first shot give second.

We while. anymore. we're getting vaccine we're trying get doses people's arms quickly possible. provinces (e.g. NB, Ontario, Manitoba, Alberta) recently started allowing people get second dose 28 days first (I've even seen posts clinics allow people get second shot Pfizer 21 days places). heroes desantis, Carlson, guy Facebook save them, don’t worry Absolutely true - I’m getting 2nd 22nd I’m thrilled! is. know deep bones feels like die. players going forced vaccinate.
Life easier ones do, guys inconvenient protocols, one forcing anything.

As dolphins fan, warms heart hear though thanks splitting hairs. I’m talking socialism loosely

The sheer majesty two sentences, one other. art. Bus stations *might* help NC. don’t think subways here. Charlotte light rail “stations” speak of. Public transport really, really thin. Also people getting general. People didn’t mask up, social distance, etc.  think posted regarding topic ever right now, seem really worked take breath. Honestly, think everyone plans get vaccinated already has. don’t see vaccination rates going higher. Good News Germany. I'm wondering they're prime boost vaccination strategy achieve not?  sure, keep mind Canada surge first shot vaccination numbers April/May. Folks vaccinated becoming eligible second dose. I'm expecting see similar surge second doses. Need keep pressure get fully vaccinated Canada beyond. Delta variant teaches world anything, solution worldwide allowing virus flourish mutate one region potential make vaccines less less effective. Great. Pls open border now. good article. Amazing gets lost translation try boil complex phenomena, like physics aerosol transmission, form feel understandable. Love good Dutch herring. Another thing tell - relative mine survived covid-19 bunch long term symptoms, worse ed he's 30 so.

With seriously take ed country think vaccination campaign around would help greatly.  Oh well... I’ll continue reading preprints masking - I’m tracking downvotes, even Reddit does! 😅 happy live Oregon we'll least get 80% September. idiot states like Alabama Mississippi even 50% September. Yes, zero problem blaming tricked. saw article guy passed vaccine January, got Covid ended requiring double lung transplant. message ""if known know now."" Here's problem: know then, chose believe it. 

People refusing get vaccine heard arguments get vaxxed chosen dismiss them. They've chosen ignore advice career scientists instead believe rando Facebook YouTube guru. They're helpless pawns, they're people consciously knowingly made choice. Unfortunately them, choices consequences. March 28 days apart moderna shots Yukon I'm fine that. say eat rich time, going billionaires I'd much rather people developed thing may end saving humanity virus opposed venture capitalist, media mogul tech bro I've saying delta variant dangerous along. initial days got downvoted infinity saying that. I'm glad least people accept dangerous.

All reason get vaccinated. know family claimed get infected went pick delivery package infected person passing by.
Which also means one must wear mask even immediately stepping door. think ""meh. gate. It'll fine""

I hope country reduce gap first second doses. extremely large number people got firstt dose AZ vaccine, wait 3 months next.
Many people getting infected long duration I'm scared new mutations already popping up. Since infection first dose, highly likely mutation evades current vaccines develop. might need booster sure happens. People careless since last March. Cases stay 10-15k day drop opposed rest world get second shot first first shot second. Here's couple extra tables.

But agree feels like numbers going thanks vaccination also thanks fact people staying outside soon stop vaccination isn’t far enough go back up. keep reading UK act laboratory. wonder uk population feels think better strategy could chosen Yes way I’m bit worried it. 

Don’t get wrong, I’m really happy Belgium reopening get freedom, however true 30% population fully vaccinated stage therefore 70% still risk variant. 

At last press conference Friday, insist making sure get second dose (unless JJ) mention would increase contact tracing, going back 7 days rather 2 days symptoms appeared etc. Hopefully efficient.

From risk management perspective, following equation always applies:

Risk Exposure = Risk Impact X Probability

When ""risk impact"" part means ""the entire country, everyone within everything everyone owns"", impact pretty much unfathomably large number.

No matter small probability is, multiplied risk losing everything, resulting risk may turn small all.

is really necessary sustainable take one instance risk, however small may be, apply entire country, small timeframe? Really? Where?

On hand, since Canadians seem getting vaccines originally advised timelines, may reconsider. 

Did vaccine manufacturers actually approve different timelines valid vaccines, changes independent decisions made province’s health experts? problem countries people given choice. research shows issues improve time. Albeit slowly some. 

It’s also common issue viruses, we’ve never studied virus like Covid Thank kind comments! currently plan lift restrictions, stage 3 certainly lift **most** them.

Really, wow, that’s interesting. think Quebec one first places openly admit going follow second dose schedule. It’s surprising many countries opting follow guidelines set vaccine manufacturers. pharma companies making big stink early on, haven’t heard much lately. Lol. Someones wives downvoting. Great argument. I'm sold. Alpha agree bad luck. Delta demographics combined border control. talking bollocks, mate. Keep mind person needs 2 doses, particular shipment covers closer 5%. Add already though we're close 10%. Frankly surprising. Ontario's government done pretty well dealing pandemic, especially considering conservative, tried lifting restrictions early ahead second wave, damn near collapsed medical system. 

If think Delta variant last one we'll see, nuts. virus mutated every 3-4 months become vaccine resistant transmissable. likely E G world catches vaccinations get start again. luck, many mRNA production facilities online make lot vaccine much faster. UK variant: Bad luck.

Delta variant: Large Indian population combined weak border controls. point make? Extortionist Capitalism, development vaccines funded taxpayer money yet fat, greedy, already-well-paid executives get rich hiking prices. Embarrassing people think good thing. absolute shambles depending state worse.

It could super easy ever since became clear would vaccines. never understand compile lists civil registry given everybody waiting list spot first round prioritisation based age already known factors, like ""works city fire brigade"". People who'd reasons higher list could hand documentation waiting list ID everything would reasonably smoothly day one.

I accepted this, long majority keeps voting politicians again, nothing ever change. nine chancellors since 1949, five conservative (CDU) ruled total 52 72 years. Interesting point. Thanks bringing attention. It’s going lot Manitoba know. 

My sister vaccinated Astra Zeneca, second dose going Pfizer. (Perhaps due concerns blood clots; I’m sure)

Her daughter vaccinated Pfizer, saying Pfizer available getting Moderna second dose. sounds weird me. 

Now we’re wondering there’s way sister give Pfizer vaccine daughter it. 

My husband vaccinated UAE Sinopharm. already know we’re screwed, we’ve checked country resident give us Pfizer August. I’m expecting two doses, I’ll put fuss it’s not. lot traveling know everywhere going different regulations what’s acceptable. Can't fix stupid. story totally false. lot people age range vaccinated nobody offered herring (myself included). There's also literally nothing media. Apparently someone gave herring vaccination center gift, that's it. article taken down. Ah that’s famously virus doesn’t travel people, lands airport spreads. him, would inject load full Covid-19 Delta viruses prove everyone wrong.  So, solution everyone getting vaccine earlier? pull doses thin air? Ok see complainers gonna complain matter what. First appointments sent people complainers complained: ""ThIs HiGhLy InEfFiCiEnT oPeN vAcCiNaTiOnS!!1!"". vaccinations open: ""YoU sEnD aPpOiNtMeNt!!1!"".

And record use bot script put minimal effort research vaccines available. black magic. get it, probably people good dictatorship someone tells without even know brush teeth.

So yes, normal. Especially vaccination mandatory one force it. dictatorship. CTE? CTE?? that?  notion covid vaccines important thing 'Africa' needs pure privileged thinking.

This article claim covid vaccines important thing 'Africa' needs.

And scare quotes around 'Africa'? trying make point diverse place different needs? *many* million plus die diarrhea malaria tb every year interested then.

Have heard myriad clean drinking water efforts? work malaria vaccines? think TB getting Covid far list threats Africa.

Wikipedia calls ""Fallacy relative privation"". nice Shorty. Would even greater could speed vaccination country. Trudeau screwed procurement badly first set us back months. agree comments thanking front line workers Canadians lining roll sleeves. Don’t heaping praise incompetent politicians.

That's exactly works lol, would've told made amendment they've clearly missed realised.

Either way fantastic really AZ. highly organized. take appointment online, turn efficient operation, check id, vaccine you, wait fifteen minutes case. Whole thing takes twenty minutes max! That's works lol tried make sense study. couldn’t see compared unvaccinated population. help out? Mutations happen time, people infected greater chance advantageous variant appearing. India, given large population always likely see emergent variant. Odds Epsilon appear Sub-Saharan Africa given that's large unvaccinated populations. even true, gave vaccine givers (not sure they're called). guess depends definition “quite rare”. 

The incidence Covid among fully vaccinated people would consider fairly high places routinely test asymptomatic people. Even want look symptomatic severe cases, don’t consider [84 cases 806 quite rare. hospitalizations, yes. infection accurate analogy all. Oh right on, must’ve skipped word! Yeah must area thing Lol UK 2nd shots US think countries 10m+ populations. whole thing UK forgoing 2nd doses hasn’t true since April movie good. probably anti-vaxxers got ideas. Source? indication Ontario lift restrictions stage 3, return normal plan It’s blocked two doses either. Delta variant spreading around husband’s previous place employment like wildfire. testing positive fully vaccinated, won’t likely suffer (most asymptomatic fact) go spread family members, could spell real trouble. 

In UK, sounds like people hospitalized Delta variant [65 % unvaccinated, 25% partially vaccinated, 10% fully That’s terribly meaningful unless compare proportion people population vaccination status, it’s still troubling 84 fully vaccinated people hospital Covid. others countries want observe progress learn that's good thing.

Re UK variant UK became lab pure bad luck.

Re Delta variant restricted travel India earlier most. large Indian population inevitably means travel Europe. Plus restrictions eventually came weak. pisses off. gov weak this.

Re single dose strategy. big positive. gov advisors got right great countries could learn this.

Re medical trials therapeutics. great UK could run experiments benefit all. believe due structure health care.

Re real world vaccine reports. good supplies AZ Pfizer earlier most. combined structure health care able run lot real world studies. Another positive UK everyone could learn that.

Yes. wonder it’s insignificant number significant number though. 

If 5% population immunocompromised allergies severe enough make able take vaccine, herd immunity calculated based actual population rather eligible population, much higher percentage eligible population get vaccinated herd immunity reached. 

On hand, 0.5% population can’t vaccinated medical reasons, barely make difference herd immunity calculations. it’s really age need account for. combat besides worried Reddit?

What's consensus delta variant vaccinated individual? virus humanity ever eradicated small pox. took decades vaccine

Polio still around, big threat knew Canada caught vaccination rates they’d go right back shitting Americans lmao.

You didn’t contribute vaccine development gladly taking anyways, that’s ok we’re happy help! Damn, AC Portuguese summer sounds brutal. cant make new post forum, someone explain safe kids walk around without masks indoors? Everywhere go kids (and adults) wearing masks. mean EVERYWHERE. like past 2 months. state Im less 50% vax rate, like say everyone safe.

Not zero, flu still statistically deadly healthy children 11 Ya, person here.

Plenty still waiting second dose. wait haircut.  figure? unvaccinated people get delta? Wouldnt vaccine evading variant spread amongst vaccinated. say hardest way say english like imagine made population count like summer camp. “One Two,
One Two, One Two…” “ok twos go get jabs, ones, come back next month.” Really? hear latter much often. almost never hear ""one two"" people; usually say ""half"" point. (""One x"" fairly common numbers, though.) know sign walk ins? 


I vaccinated Pfizer UK yesterday. next mid-august. I'd drive part UK notice could get vaccinated July. really hope too. Especially Delta variant really takes off. 

I live vaccinated county NC. still 64% total population vaccinated first shot (compared 44% statewide). 18-24 year olds getting vaccinated know motivated them, especially UNC system going require vaccines colleges. last part worries someone TA person one universities starting August mildly immunosuppressed (aka vaccine worked me, knows.) Well, countries Europe non-existent (quite literally) border control border crossings even advantage island, leads ""naturally fortified borders"".

I guess bad luck cases, Alpha Delta. questionable decision keep flights India coming country even though known Delta spreading like wildfire India.  gaslight everyone sees reality takes seriously I’m 40 years old. I’m also disabled Vet. VA called ask wanted even though nationally age group hadn’t called. said sure. wife drove signing ask wife wife wanted it, she’s 33. said sure bam early especially age group. get it? father elderly I’ll anything help protect Regarding ""long term"" side effects, reason suggest side effects could emerge years line? though millions people grow third arm five years time?

Is fair say serious side effects, they'd identified now, majority ""rare"" side effects individual would identified first weeks inoculation? Yeah it’s nothing brag US seems hit wall vaccine hesitancy past month half so

Hopefully changes fall hits Delta variant = Indian variant. changed names. Look China commented Taiwan Taiwan turning Covid political game, they’re ones actively making hard Taiwan get vaccines. indian variant. changed name Good point 👍 Right on. Everyone brain got shot weeks months ago. reasons Brazillians still trying understand indeed investigating.

It's exactly mystery. every leader particular political slant handled pandemic across globe. Cover up, deny, lie, obfuscate, obstruct award medical contracts friends. public entity, controlled elected government. way civil servants UK permanent secretaries, work government apolitical, way advisory body, SAGE, group scientists work civil servants independent government. common way say germany. title german translated nearly word word.  bullshit. got mine soon can. wanna reward someone reward us right thing Delta continues grew Europe along smae trajectory now, just, lots luck exactly situation UK now, buta weeks later. I. e.: similar wave

At least Germany number delta variant cases *decreased* last weeks absolute numbers, even relative share gone up.

You can't build similar wave R&lt;1. This. Except extreme circumstances fully vaccinated exempt Covid rules. internet television exist EU keeps vaccination pace, likely build enough immunity new outbreak occurs. rapidly catching UK delta still common EU countries.  dumbo know that? proving point buddies big favor ""fight freedom"". need, no, *want* ilk represent, defend, fight for, speak for, think for, way, shape form represent me. task, every conceivable level. that's get childrens' variant. We've got pretty high number people doses (about 57%), delaying first dose earlier year new variant. think problem letting Delta flood restrictions far long, combined removing restrictions hardly young people vaccinated due supply issues. Also government removed masks schools around time, rise cases 🤦‍♀️ cocktail bad luck stupid decisons buffoon Boris Johnson.

It interesting see variant plays countries see makes difference. hope bump road huge wave. UK approving vaccines 18s currently. f&amp;ck CNN playing clips Trump say it?! hell cares thinks anything screw CNN too. one door.

[One shot Pfizer 94% effective preventing serious illness requiring hospitalization (up 96% two shots). opposite true. Inactivated virus vaccines typically least effective. body preferentially select best protein targets inactivate virus, generate intracellular immune response like mRNA viral vector vaccines (which seems key triggering strong B cell key long term immunity hypothesized improve ability deal variants). 

Inactivated virus vaccines second oldest vaccine tech behind attenuated vaccines (indirectly via weak viruses like Cowpox intentionally Pasteur's first experiments anthrax rabies vaccines). There's reason tried come better technologies like protein subunit vaccines - ultimately - viral vector mRNA vaccines today. Nope.

We cannnot.

The problem immune system increibly complex, understand part work. That's run slow, expensive, trials vaccine, we've real way knowing sure they'll work. they’ll fine none. You’re already protected protecting others virus. Think longer shelf life (canned tomato vs regular tomato). One necessarily take longer digest two reasons rule:

1. Vaccines perfect, weaing mask gives additional protection little cost.

2. made rule said ""Only unvaccinated people must wear mask"" people would claim they'd vaccinated, wear mask. would encorage spread.  aren’t firsts vaccinated? There's evidence causing many breakthrough infections, really big deal vaccinated.  anti-vaxer mental illness.  every person.

Personally, never heard every second person. Maybe get there, vaccine hesitancy UK 6%. improvement 1% previous month.

The hesitant age group 16-29 13% data vaccines opened them, improves uptake intent. Also concerted SCMP sways ways. symptoms previous variants? sound similar. |The hope delta wave might delayed enough drag autumn, would needed another lockdown anyway
 

What? autumn we'll everyone fully vaccinated (mostly pfizer/biontech). makes assume we'll need another lockdown then? Indeed. far cry Bolivia, Ecuador, Mexico, 100% undercount. Peru also undercount till weeks ago, revised criteria pretty much aligned official toll excess deaths toll. wonder country honesty.

But point, start trying deconstruct isn’t interested say like trying prove what’s cloud really looks like. Obviously people voted general metric course people don’t care like people didn’t vote care. speculate endlessly it’s that. Suffice say people care. mRNA vaccines 90% effective delta variant. That's Canada uses. There's big group unvaccinated people country aged 0-30, would even larger group start delta spreading. nothing vaccines. oh wow, another reason get vaccinated lol 1. Strategic reasons. USA wants Taiwan ally economy depends semiconductors TSMC, like China good ally them.
2. cannot doses Pfizer/BioNTech China less forces buy Chinese firm Fosun that, happening due conflict two countries. Pfizer/BioNTech *the* vaccine industrialized first world countries.
3. Taiwan currently battling outbreak able keep virus borders long time.

Nothing burger coming hol up, transmit COVID STD too? UK started vaccinating 30, we’ve vaccinating 12+ weeks. That’s critical difference. One vaccine effective slowing controlling outbreaks. 2nd shots start ramping up, I’m 40 getting 2nd shot Monday. We’ll zoom too. bad probably come time family friend mine recently got diagnosed esophagus cancer lymph node mataisis. like trials even 50 different substances require meaningful production compared 2.5+ billion doses administered worldwide already. really affect large scale production all.

The potential finding something new better worth sure. sample size small mean anything. Let make choice heard cousins taking think able get pregnant lol I'm done this. Novavax participant last 9 months clear idea UK government government accept trial vaccination, get another vaccination Monday.

The fact Europe opening longer prepared double quarantine decided put forward trial. Added this, UK EU governments prepared state timelines around efforts coordinate, forced double vaccinate. reality global pandemic vaccinated approved vaccines, clear Novavax massive supply chain issues around key ingredients based recent Reuters reports, suggest vaccine get approval end year.

For American participants might fine big country, us Europe borders, especially Brexit Britain, us family cross borders, effectively fucked bothered put forward last year help common good.

If something bad happens thanks double vaccination, hate say it, Novavax need pick pieces pay medical costs. never signed go jail, need acknowledge this.   mention ""Under 60s make appointment Astrazeneca, recommend take, also one get, also it"".

Personally would've appreciated actually choice. Living Nordic country cannot get AstraZeneca completely restricted 65+ (save got first dose restriction put place).

This means take maybe two months able get vaccine, especially back queue pretty strict age ordering.

As adult would nice allowed make risk assessment. excellent, nearly halfway there. said ""going forward.""

If two shots almost 3× protection one shot, better give two shots.

It total protection (that's math) would concentrated vulnerable people.  That's true straight fake news.

There long time 60+ could vaccined exclusively (not 70+). opened numbers low vacs people. addition since local doctors vaccinating too, mainly give vacs old sick patients.

Every single person know 50+ years old vaccinated.  It’s damn shame. vaccine seems good one shadiness beginning cast suspicion whole thing. like Johnson &amp; Johnson AstraZeneca nowhere good mRna vaccines especially antibodies

Clearly opposite working us. Yeah, be. it’s done people occasionally cock ups.

That’s time would mix doses, nothing say even happened yet. Can’t imagine won’t happened least twice though. I’m Canadian started mixing Pfizer Moderna well. next weeks we’re getting much higher shipments Moderna Pfizer they’re advising getting moderna second dose rather waiting month longer get Pfizer (regardless first shot was). 33% concrete. 3 weeks much higher.

And know sat bad strategy working lol. Still dominant Ireland surprisingly.  I'm indoor gamer, got second shot.

I'm saying lock everything again, needs something get people vaccinated. tried nice, maybe time get mean force shit.

It's annoying, live MO, city cases really low, unvaccinated people rural counties starting come crowd hospitals. bad peak Covid winter, starting get noticeable again. two parents immunocompromised see frequent trips hospital.

Further, CDC notes: ""If discovered dose inadvertently administered within grace period ≤4 days recommended date second dose (i.e., 17–20 days dose 1), dose considered valid."" So, spouse fine sense.

I think healthy get more, ease restrictions make sense. example, simply make sense scientifically wear mask outdoors, especially family know. saying run kiss they're unvaccinated concerns you, miniscule amount risk standing outside near others think might holding back necessarily relaxing little.

A new study, coordinated researchers Federal University Pelotas Harvard University (USA), revealed Brazil, immunization Covid-19 prevented death 43,000 people 2021 alone.

The research serves proof efficiency CoronaVac Astrazeneca immunizers, applied larger quantities country. According study, 94% elderly aged 70 years older received least first dose vaccine.

The results corroborate findings experiments, one conducted São Paulo city Serrana, proved CoronaVac's ability reduce 86% hospitalizations 95% deaths coronavirus infection. survey updated months, covering analysis immunization impacts longer period time.

The reduced load yet ANOTHER good reason masking up. Source   wow that's scary know anyone expecting sort surge fall. vaccinated get sooner later. breakthrough cases, minority. Personally need kid vaccinated, otherwise is. giant caveat “not doctor”: experience outdoor vs indoor makes wonder you’ve vitamin levels tested recently. Autoimmune illness last decade+, meds don’t help me, keeping vitamin level high normal per doctor’s orders actually makes noticeable difference fatigue brain fog. Might worth looking haven’t already.

Wishing best. Fatigue debilitating symptom, able-bodied concept awful be. dad 49 refusing vaccine, advice trying convince him?  absolutely writing ""COVID"" cop comes gunshot wound dies gunshot wound.

No one anywhere planet done this. even single time. Indeed. People forget still phase 3 vaccines. little monitoring far adverse effects vaccines. really follow complications know self reported. I'm still control group possible reproductive issues known 2-3 years started vaccinating people. seems weird push novel vaccine novel technique hard fast, particularly kids options data appear working. latest meta analysis Ivermectin leaves doubt works countries reaching US ignores it.

Ever since milit4ry D1ct4torship fell Brazilians allowed vote, elections also super clean. electronic urns proven safe time time again. even democratic country, C0up happened becuase milit4ry like results elections. think opinion almost bad lax, masks-not-effective, snake oil opinion. I’ve read hospital capacity past year never lower. articles always use image?  consensus they've underreporting deaths factor 10-20x.

damn...  Mine 59, diabetic obese still won’t get vaccine. Oh two kids 18 (16&amp;10). ever manage convince dad let know did. It’s frustrating watching parents make wrong decisions. think people committing big sin get line vaccine later they're eligible for, long get vaccinated time vaccine easily available everyone. want first, fine, plenty people do. someone wants take vaccine June instead January it. know first responders managed deal worst pandemic day day . I've read many horror stories know experience something like PTSD lasting scars .

I tip hat first responders sorry . imagine consider giving career daily past year.  med system west pussified. truth people take granted. guy got lung implant great. make go debt. thing people hostile attack care givers. Fine fuck set prison hospitals. Problem need someone make statment take action get done. help disinformation, helps extreme right, destabilizes democracies, helps less democratic powers like Russia  stop people dying, maybe stop serious illness, reports Chile indicate quite 'leaky' vaccinated still pass Covid get it. assumes Chile dosing regimen, etc China.  really look back lol mean sure lines willing embrace vaccine antivaxxers hardlines point pandemic presented information choose inconvenient information  experienced researchers embracing political warm fuzzies told everything fine world decided stop force ap iece cloth mouth step 1 fr global control .

I fault someone fearful point mountain information , research, even vaccine available. choose embrace knowledge fact choosing pride , comfort , potentially death serious health issues.  
It choice making .     happened January, vaccines come out. Anyone passed vaccine giving someone else turn sooner. trouble overly faulting people rushing beginning vaccine line even eligible. guy wants back vaccine line, it, see deciding go back line front something deserving strong penalties. happened US summer, would another story.  try sway u/outsidenorms facts. That's government policy. Unvaccinated people like drunk drivers. government coward. primarily due holiday weekend effect two weeks ago data dumps couple states past week. Adjusting factors shows continued inexorable decline. is, course, expected - rate decline likely ceiling vaccinations disappointingly low.

Furthermore, first dose shots low ever been. Actually “30s research.”

I googled “natural immunity variants” new study, released preprint medRxiv* server, demonstrates vaccines may less effective countering newer variants compared natural .net/news/20210409/Does-natural-infection-with-SARS-CoV-2-offer-more-protection-than-a-vaccine-against-new-variants.aspx

I didn’t use deceptive search terms. didn’t go page 7 google results find article. It’s right top page.

Yes, find articles say otherwise well. shows it’s settled science. American Medical Association held debate discussion forum two days ago doctors scientists sides debate. yes, doctors AMA forum suggest previously infected individuals may need vaccinated may qualify immunity credentials. doctors AMA plague rats too?

I’m even trying argue side right wrong. I’m saying calling everyone disagree “plague rats” incredibly dehumanizing, inflammatory, poor taste. call risky, call inconsiderate, even argue misinformed informed. “plague rat” hateful. 

Also, idea people make decisions don’t live lives don’t suffer personal consequences decisions people make. people choose vaccinate legitimate reasons. Yet you, “plague rats”.

FWIW going rain making mud pies big part nursery education nowadays, least places outdoor space (hint new parents, look nurseries gardens).

Mind wife immense immune system, never gets sick, fit racking cough week covid, buy little pulse oximeter. (Although think anxiety, even panic never bad chest infection before). Probably key 12 micrograms, vaccine proved tolerable, recipients developed antibodies blocked virus entering cells. Perhaps it’s surprise, then, CureVac’s shot came short, says Nathaniel Wang, chief executive Replicate Bioscience, RNA-focused biotech start-up based San Diego, California. low antibody titres early testing “already red flag”, says.

Pfizer uses 30 micrograms Moderna 100 micrograms friend fine. knows guy. Luckily none circle got hit hard sorts people one/two degrees separation away different issues.

Here's idea. can't force individuals take vaccine, health insurance companies forced pay treatment idiots come severe illness result? uber-geniuses obviously self-made billionaires, right? F absolutely can. Gravity noun mean something akin severity, also noun, makes perfectly fine sentence structure. particularly idiomatic modern English dialects make use word secondary meaning (originally primary meaning) medical context much used be. usage entirely ""legal"" sentence structure. Heck, might even different meaning severity particular medical field. sounds funny laymen used colloquial English concern. according SCOTUS ruling.  Depends meant lab leak. accidental leak natural virus found wild possible. covid engineered lab suited fictional novel. ehhhhhh. see point time likely friends family share views. say spreading awareness, arent spreading awareness me, spreading awareness circle may views had. evidence, iirc, help anti-vaxxers vaccine hesitant change mind, doesnt harm raise awareness old child? That's good noble point, agree sentiment; unfortunately poor job incentivizing everyone get vaccinated. goal fact get many people possible vaccinated, guaranteed monetary reward (as opposed slim possibility much larger reward) getting vaccinated effectively motivate many fence. thing difference make? Either deadly covid virus goin around deadly flu going around. It’s like dying flu somehow better worth avoiding. 

It’s like getting shit shotgun yelling “nuh uh!! ar-15!!”

Like difference make bleed Smokers fucked taste smell anyway Well. Let's pretend perfect. definitely prioritization got treatment last year. lot justified medical grounds, little point intubating someone 90s intensive, painful procedure poor prospects. cost/benefit definitely comes equation too.

But can't perfect money driven systems (not private paying systems like US, market-oriented social insurers like Germany too) often incentivise doctors/healthcare providers look extra interventions might fully medically justified. Read vaccine FAQ sub. address fears go get vaccine put pandemic behind you.   ECMO ~3 weeks, kept awake physical therapy, lungs finally showed up. 

Thankfully it’s mostly uphill since then.  I'll see ya 5 years pal. what? noooooooo thats impossssible may studies, anecdotal stories Indian doctors young patients sicker upon entering hospital earlier waves. lack evidence, evidence worse.  Now, I'm saying **want** catch Covid spend entire fortune getting better, leaving lower-middle class also healthy enough athlete anymore... would have, Germans say, SchadenfreudeBoner. amount people ineligible due immunocompromised small fucking minority statistically doesn’t matter. want it, get it. It’s job hero civilization forget capacity may reduced somewhat winter, fraction health care workers enough shit people vaccination, moved areas left practice.  easy solution would health insurance companies deny coverage person get medical treatment Covid aren’t vaccinated without compelling medical reason getting vaccinated. start implementing Fall.

I’m sure threat 5-6 figure medical bill convince people “on fence.” People learn faster face threat financial ruin. knew someone like that. reason it’s past tense he’s dead. “fake virus”. didn’t even time disassociate happened. I’m sad people closest him.   worse, point news article summary foreign language article small uncontrolled study 12 people tiny village northern Wakanda showed 7 die Covid yet therefore fake. end playing whackamole, pointing obvious flaws whatever 'source' is, understanding basic science fundamentals studies work, point different, equally flawed article, equate ""number hastily created copy/paste articles"" ""validity argument"". thread getting brigaded potentially aggressive dopers?

Not everything matter opinion.

This also matter opinion.

Some protection better protection, end day. gotten doses yes, feel helped recovery. brain fog cleared since getting vaccine. That's exactly selection works. Viruses mutate randomly side-stepping mutations emerge everywhere. mutation simply outcompete others wherever emerges thanks ability side step vaccine see particular reason emerge one place specifically rather usual places high circulation.

But anyway, even assuming right, point still stands - makes sense apply precautions avoid future event whose consequence be...applying precautions, precautions likely prevent event happening first place. 

If assume vaccine-evading variant emerge due mere presence vaccinated people (as in, variant outcompetes others due ability evade vaccines), makes sense apply precautions variant emerge anyway able avoid I'd rather free meantime.

If assume vaccine-evading variant emerge scenario described, logic response vaccinate many people possible, remove precautions vaccines would kill circulation therefore chances virus mutate.

If assume vaccine-evading variant emerge due high circulation, makes sense keep applying precautions populations people vaccinated because, said, would completely control anyway.

""and"" ""or"" Ehh there’s lot dumb people everywhere, happens dumb people got _lot_ dumb, paranoid vocal last 4 years.  Actually proven distancing masking adaptable changes. effectively, avoid lockdowns. also found improving air circulation filtration enclosed areas, costly, reduces spread. tools.and scientific knowledge stay safe staying open. yes, need prepare worst case fall. got us trouble first place. 

Prior rise Delta variant, many scientists say foresee kind rapid spread fall winter last year. information obsolete. 

If businesses invest money update air circulation, add screens shields, implement distancing measures stay open, inconvenience wear mask public place next couple seasons? one telling businesses lock down. Many asking help keep safe something cheap effective anyone do. see issue. masks mandated again, disrupt economy we've become smarter implement public measures? think mean disrupts comfortability. cares, saves lives. Let’s hope so. really worried time fully vaccinated new wave due delta variant fundamental rights restricted again. won’t accept respond civil disobedience.

I again. protect ass hats refuse get vaccinated. Let get deal consequences. goal Canada decrease severe illness hospitalization avoid overflowing ICUs. 1 shot strategy successful this. Spanish flu hit younger people lot harder COVID hits older people harder.    like I'm back fleet again.  lol, quite Yes cost living substantially less though. 

You can't cherry pick one thing consider variables. BLS, U.S. residents country's lowest income decile spend 35% pre-tax incomes health care, compared 3.5% U.S. residents country's highest income decile. However, individuals highest income decile spend dollars health care, average $8,720, compared average $2,119 among individuals lowest income insurance UK covers healthcare (pensions too) pay National Insurance contributions earn £184 week pay 12% earnings limit £967 week rate drops 2% earnings £968 yeah, enough false comparisons please. Canada knew going supply issues decided implementing 1 dose strategy would best choice. vulnerable population prioritized second doses rapidly rolling second doses everyone else. 

The 1 dose strategy also benefit preventing severe cases hospitalization even variants concern. Considering we've issues ICUs full parts Canada smart decision. know live Canada seeing hospitalization almost entirely vaccinated.   lot anger issues younger, thankfully try act like adult 90% time now.  meant, sounds like he's projecting. fought well Jason curious, looked up. 2020, COVID-19 caused line-of-duty deaths US law enforcement causes year, COVID-19 related fatalities highest cause officer line-of-duty deaths, according 2020 law enforcement officers fatalities National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund.

There 264 officers levels died line duty 2020, 96% increase previous year since 1974, according report. deaths, 145 confirmed COVID-19 cases, report said.”    Seems like many aspects, US population WAY polarized elsewhere. least number people genuinely belive real pretty far live, mean every one agrees mind you: agree everything that's done regards pandemic, beginning admit skeptical actual lethality (not existante, conséquences), sure hell think fake. mean, come on... level make believe astronomical. likely new variants emerge places vaccinated.

Actually, vaccine side stepping variants likely emerge significant portion, nowhere near enough herd immunity, vaccinated. unvaccinated portion population allows steady spread, vaccinated portion creates strong selective pressure vaccine side-stepping variants emerge. ok sErGeAnt 🤭 sports. forget sports Horrible. horrible. sad story.  that's terrible. I'm almost 32 mobility disability super careful past year. think family thought overreacting, never got I'm fully vaccinated. friends still fence getting vaccinated deeply concerning, they're young parents.

I think part hesitancy regarding vaccine safety, thinking risks par getting covid-19. much mis dis-information there. Haven’t lockdowns done opposite? Increased educational inequalities? Yes don’t think clearly used to. fatigue, feel better work outside vs working indoors too. It’s weird. could chores inside feel like dying. go work garden, wash car, etc feel much better. Except different. Young, unvaccinated people driving growth Delta variant numbers. also, say, tend less severe reactions, hence UK maintains lower death rate. expected normality year gave Greek alphabet using ""alternate names"" LOL.

Gotta love climate change. /s know anyone covid either, virus prevalent also led lack urgency vaccine procurement distribution. Re: antibodies Sinopharm, people tested antibodies mostly elderly, specifically started doubting efficacy revealed vaccine made used elderly tested people 60. them, least spoken far, either antibodies all, negligable amounts it.

And sure, test may surefire indication built immunity virus, again, vaccine developed for, tested on, certain age group, people age group got vaccine anyway antibodies, suppose that's little unsettling. :/ explanation heard offered back find lot. ""Current smokers lower risk former smokers high risk."" idea people quit smoking they're seriously ill something. Whether cancer, heart problems, maybe even bad hypertension. Illness serves wake call.

So idea ""smoker"" could way selecting people without serious comorbodity. cop actually safe job compared manual labour jobs, average compared jobs. driving much it'd one safest jobs. weird, pfizer handed 3 weeks, moderna 4 AZ standard 12 someone rural area, it’s really kind call people like rednecks. Regardless anti vax not. Redneck pretty derogatory know plenty blue collar, working folks got vaccinated. It’s incredibly sad story yet fact remains situation incredibly rare, didn’t look particularly healthy beforehand. would interesting know there’s anything behind scenes may contributed it. 

But said, there’s one narrative allowed subreddit.

e; type 2 diabetes asthma. shocker, least not. Although masks still mandated public transportation NYC, gaggles four NYPD officers stand around maskless everyone around covered. Naked megalomania. Yes add year half lot canadians got spend much time home families. Balances  Honesty? Telling world covid largely affects older people? kind help think going accomplish? fosters belief younger people nothing worry about. real danger pandemic people already, ""silent spreaders."" people know it. quarantine... stop spread. get 2nd dose certain time maximize effectiveness.... I'll admit that, even though spouse double vaccinated pfizer, remain concerned covid. concession degree mental health, we've distanced, maked, outdoor visits inlaws, resumed going required doctors appointments, we've continued stay inside, avoid gatherings, mask whenever need leave house.

The biggest source concern live area 30% population fully vaccinated, less 40% started vaccination- numbers tapering quickly. state highest number cases delta variant, even though pfizer vaccine remains fairly effective it, sheer number opportunities come across infected people makes uncomfortable risk.

The vaccine rollout also complete debacle. scheduled second dose couple days early, hospital administering vaccine refused move appointment adhere full 21-day guidance timing doses, ended getting second shots day 19. idea point might done overall level effectiveness respect vaccine us.

Finally, seem lot discussion around risks long covid nastier covid symptoms people infected. consequences infection truly nothing bad cold flu days week, I'd start consider easing restrictions, risk neurological complications, reduced cognitive performance, myriad potential long-covid symptoms makes disinclined risk one people gets breakthrough case. I’m appalled beginning pandemic, many people literally singing praises first responders brave enough put path infection continue serve critical needs community.

Now many undoubtedly contracted virus developed antibodies, thus feel lesser need vaccinate, comments turned castigating evil people, dumb people, etc. Simply chose exercise risk assessment instead allowing others idea circumstances decide them.

Yes, you’ve stayed indoors extremely cautious since March 2020, immune system naive virus may better inducing immunity via vaccination. you’ve serving community front lines every single working day past 1.5 years you’ve already exposed caught virus, you’re allowed decide it’s personally necessary you.

I say frontline healthcare worker fully vaccinated since January. ""A university medicine said it, believe that?""

Seriously? fine. one many studies. Mmm, California rolls… That's really problem is. many people seem poorly developed bullshit detectors. They'll believe stuff rightly eye-rolled loud ""What fuck"" reading it.

Yeah, we're ""the information age"", better called ""the misinformation age"". There's always gullible people fall scams bad information, figure many.

It's sad scary.  That’s marketing slogan, legal requirement.  multiplied fast India springs outbreak there. Due virus characteristics infect people fairly quickly due higher doubling rate. estimate August create quite outbreak. issue California, lots travel tourists summer.  goes show deep rot society is. selfish asshole driving car, many die traffic accidents? increase vaccination worth it. Enemies state like CCP, Russia White Supremacists influencing 2016 election it’s far fetched believe they’re trying fuck vaccine rollout prolong pandemic ruin economy.  smart J&amp;J vaccines could put good use. distributed areas populations it’s hard get people go two doses. Around areas lacking inner city extremely rural poor distribution. Yeah joke guess people don’t understand humor sub demand china kept exporting instead forcing people vaccinate.

once demand vaccines there, even kept exporting doses crazy run. Marginal tax rates genius  WC going November summer heat Qatar.

winter Northern recorded 585 deaths 220,800 cases pandemic. Middle East’s first World Cup due start Nov. 21, 2022. Well what’s point? reasonable question? standby viewpoint world needed culling took wrong people.

If faith humanity before, somehow became less 0 after. Early wasn’t issue men smoke China?

How come smoking might protect them, exact opposite early reports China. I'm rewriting history - seem selective amnesia. [This summer Europe *sooooo* open rest world back then. exactly you’re looking for, remember [write another persistent COVID case (154 days), immunocompromised persons effectively clear SARS-CoV-2 infection, case highlights potential persistent infection5 accelerated viral evolution associated immunocompromised state.

So complication specific per se, could’ve impact SARS-CoV-2 viral evolution within him. 

This Dec 2020, I’d curious learn there’s updated info this. think people jump conclusions based username lol! deliberately picked one makes look like red neck. Couldn’t truth. Venice beach cali parents British. 
I’m also vaccinated. People judgmental.

I mean ICU 14 months! That’s highly irregular. would imagine guy pre existing conditions. Okay looking purely infection rates hospitalization. alot countries hospitalization rates far important infection rates. Yes want obviously mitigate spread preventing hospitals overwhelmed critical. 

Your math purely based infection rates leaving significant part argument.  really matter since plenty young unhealthy people, ""choice"" like obesity. There's cancers, Type-1 Diabetes, immunocompromised autoimmune diseases, etc...

Considering old unhealthy people disposable makes one asshole. Lemme ask question: variants traveling quickly present travel restrictions place? means Delta variant get here? Would tighter international travel restrictions, even total shutdown, prevent new variants spreading beyond country region origin?

By time new variant identified, seems like usually late - already spread around world.

I doubt Delta variant end it. knows kind variants future store us? ""kill reproductive system."" COVID may impair male fertility. Worst case scenario even cause ED. vaccine neither. like life expectancy super high double lung transplant tbh comes next. disease first hit, aware blood clotting aspect - much virus impacting blood impacting respiratory system.

After vascular impact became well known, blood thinners got added ICU protocols COVID patients, fewer people ended meatloaf lung. 

Seems like one early patients showed intervention necessary :( wondering too, think something well-understood. many people UK access healthcare? 

Same question, USA. heard wrong wait list local doctor lazy zu show nearby vac center.   point give everyone who’s responsible regards public health chance win, reward selfish. Certainly moronic statement like ""absurd taxes"" also bullies people wear masks, wishes trump would become PM Canada whole bunch crap I’m even going get father's last words were, ""Get damn tube mouth."" agree, whichnis led huge problem study... covid vaccine get rid long covid symptoms? heard people get back normal faster vaccine. God lack empathy charts... Oh I'm sure. Thank goodness ,🙂    “But that’s discrimination!”

Unfortunately getting body give tangible info process. almost certainly due UK got 2nd doses over-50s, plus relaxing NPIs, plus year plus younger people cooped up. mass mixing unvaccinated young people, plus transmissible variant. zero evidence variant somehow affects younger people worse. past tense also mean ""become."" maybe reasons too, know.  People getting hysterical months inflation that’s almost car home prices. Economy recovering fast - outpacing staffing. There’s never better time get job raise. Yet people still whining. article LA Daily News:

Details businesses read QR codes remain unclear. nonprofit called Commons Project, belongs coalition developed health card framework, working app allow businesses read codes. meantime, businesses see person’s vaccine information digital record QR  know guy good friends someone died covid 

“Ah well people die flu time, diabetes gonna die anyway”. never flu don’t want less want covid. much pay year health insurance? Wrong answer buddy!! media framed Trump support since first Republicans never base waxing waining support, consistently reflected loses successes, never meaningful way judge interested say.

There’s also fallacy supporters care say. majority doesn’t strong opinion on, really, anything political interested anyone well-known say. He’s inarguably that. 

Regardless, point implication comment replied Trump shouldn’t given attention person doesn’t like deserves challenged. Wow thats wild ride go even eligible. Hopefully science progress point easier Wow. lost count number people know covid. long haulers three died. sceptical ""UK protocols"" remarkably successful.   It’s absolutely selfish, getting sick affects yourself, getting vaccinated cuts risk getting others sick. Whatever do, wish best good health! Since many job openings many employers desperate fill countless job openings, numbers lost meaning.  Incredibly stupid FDA approved vaccine, imperative many received it. don’t even actually use vaccine, recognize job preventing disease acceptable vaccine. **is** poorly worded sentence. sure QR code meant link website like normal - would imagine use would limited sort verification validation app, guessing there. all, user friendly system... divide 10 million number unvax'ed residents, pay everyone fixed amount - 1/3rd first dose vaccine, rest 2nd one. would waaay effective lottery.   know trying rewrite history already remember it. Picking countries entirely closed borders everyone pretending represent countries even countries banned US travelers remaining open travelers places. Nope dont quite frankly I'm going put bunch time research right now. possible hospitalization prevention rates might quite high initially think likely still going pretty high based know.

The fact Delta variant concerning two shots obviously going better still think I'd rather majority population given protection variants exist. argue suppose studies show 2 shot smaller % population better 1 shot larger % vs hospitalization?  95% + Awesome! Great job, syrup lovers. We're getting Live near Toronto getting second dose Tuesday! variants concern. hundreds thousands variants, don’t think important mutations have.

We highlight variants reason assume variant increased infectivity / lethality / immune system evasion / etc.

TLDR, haven’t found anything needs raised variant concern yet. 2nd dose lagging 1st dose much? people getting 1 dose? Singapore Moderna pfizer only, delta main variant Many young people get long term issues like fatigue etc 90% one dose mRNA, two doses? .... how? Vaccine protect perfectly fine bad cases, deaths vaccine, that’s it’s 100% effective.

Covid free fantasy, that’s herd immunity is. Things get rare essentially ‘free’ it, like tuberculosis developed countries.

There couple thousand flu hospitalization year current lockdowns. hundreds Covid cases daily despite vaccination. two same, even vaccination.

Yes, everyone hates lockdowns. We’re sick them. it’s reckless ignore risks still exist, chief concern sufficient spread virus controlled general population, eventually develop variant resistant current vaccines. think they’ll push bring back masks and/or distancing doctors say it’s time boosters? know best incentive getting vaccinated? getting covid  key, since Delta variant blocked well one dose.

Wow documented first case variant virus bypassing protections vaccines?

Do tell. breaking news, professor None vaccines expired. earliest expiration date end June. great sympathy concern people legitimate medical issues prevent getting vaxxed.  much world still waits chance get vaxxed.  
As rest, well, they've made decision based poor information must live consequences . incorrect. None vaccines expired. earliest expiration date, 100k vaccines, end June. expiration date rest vaccines later. Palestinians fully aware expiration dates long cancellation. Palestinian health ministry claimed vaccinate 60k people day, they’ve already successfully vaccinated 20k per day. choice amounts delaying vaccinating tens thousands individuals several months, least would die COVID. that's good, 24 hour news cycle unhealthy anyways. order make fear unreasonable I’m sure you’ve already gotten vaccinated right? infectious disease higher % population reach prevent disease basically ping ponging around forever. I'm sorry :'( things like right now? Interested hearing local's perspective. vaccinations coming along? irony would if/when disease mutates enough become REALLY strong extremely contagious wipes anti-vaxxers science deniers. Unfortunately, affect innocent brain dead too.  Looks like Canada got supply, administered stunning efficiency. Awesome. Way go, Canadians.  got first Moderna dose March 20th (the first day able to) second one April 13th - actually supposed come April 20th accompanying husband get standing line waved like “guess I’m getting second dose early!” lol.

That may best, experts say China yet provide satisfactory data show vaccines effectively block transmission virus variants. seven shots approved use Chinese mainland, five inactivated-virus vaccines. Four considerably lower efficacy rates mRNA shots developed West.

Countries like Seychelles Chile, fully vaccinated half populations largely Chinese vaccines, reported continued surges daily caseloads, though deaths remain relatively low.

Last week, hundreds Indonesian healthcare workers reported contracted Covid-19, dozens hospitalised, despite inoculated Chinese vaccines.

Even mRNA shots, like Pfizer Moderna, ""it still possible future variant able break produce another iteration pandemic"", said Prof Muennig.

""Even hospitalisations deaths, risk upwards 25 per cent population permanently disabled long-term Covid-19 symptoms give us pause,"" said, adding long-haul Covid-19 likely public health problem decades come.

Nearly fifth Covid-19 patients without symptoms went experience conditions consistent long-haul Covid-19 month initial diagnosis, according recent US study surveyed nearly two million Americans year.

The figure grew 27.5 per cent among symptomatic patients hospitalised, half among were. common complaints pain, breathing difficulties, high cholesterol, fatigue high blood pressure.

Moreover, long-haul symptoms afflicting younger people.

A relatively small increasing percentage American children struggling months extreme fatigue, rapid heart rate, memory loss, depression symptoms recovering Covid-19, Bloomberg reported.

Going observations, world could far bigger longer-lasting health crisis countries act urgently control spread disease infections occur.

**'Asian' values**

Nonetheless, Asian governments increasing pressure ease restrictions, recent news spotlights region's lag returning normalcy, inaction could cause economies lose others reopen.

On Bloomberg Covid-19 Resilience Ranking last month, Asia-Pacific region - often lauded effective handling outbreaks - accounted seven biggest declines measure best worst places pandemic. US parts Europe rose ranking comparatively higher proportions vaccination brought infections deaths.

However, ranking - scores pandemic handled effectively, least social economic disruption - assesses economies point time, take account potential costs premature opening up.

Ultimately, governments' choices action rooted cultural traits values people.

""In terms reopening, whether allowing larger gatherings, lifting mask restrictions, easing quarantine requirements, link country's public health directives cultural values,"" said associate professor management Umar Ruhi University Ottawa.

He explained using late Dutch social psychologist Geert Hofstede's cultural dimensions framework country-specific differences, recent study Canadian Health Policy journal.

""To ensure effective citizen participation (Covid-19) measures, countries need adopt public health policies protocols aligned culture underlying societal values.""

The dimensions Professor Hofstede's framework measure nationalities' cultural preferences individualism versus collectivism; indulgence versus self-restraint; strength social hierarchy, uncertainty avoidance, among others.

For example, national culture prizes individualism thus personal freedoms collective welfare people - like US - may driving force behind authorities' decision allow vaccinated Americans go without masks.

In comparison, countries like Singapore, whose societies espouse collectivist values, may place greater emphasis mask-wearing individuals' duty protect others around them.

Meanwhile, culture values self-restraint longer-term outlook instant gratification - Prof Hofstede found East Asian regions - may explain Asian governments' greater propensity prioritise keeping infections low thus avoid future health implications, immediate economic imperatives reopen quickly.

Essentially, also striking balance, one way necessarily best circumstances differ place place.

As Professor K.K. Cheng, director Institute Applied Health Research University Birmingham, pointed out, scrapping outdoor mask mandates countries makes sense, ""the risk transmission outdoors much lower; though places Singapore would densely populated Western standards, considerations may different"".

Prof Fukuda also noted approach countries North America Europe heavily emphasising vaccination social distancing preventive measures worked ""reasonably well"" - vaccines became available them, came cost multitudes earlier cases deaths.

The stark memories tragedy wariness history repeating could given British leaders pause planned lifting lockdown measures. Britain postponed move last week month seeks contain spread highly transmissible Delta variant races get people vaccinated.

Dr Steven Woolf, director emeritus Centre Society Health Virginia Commonwealth University, told USA Today reflected 600,000 deaths occurred US since pandemic began: ""The light end tunnel sight, bring back lives bring solace grieving families.""

Asian nations may fallen behind countries West surge ahead global race return normalcy - marathon end coronavirus pandemic far over, final outcome remains seen. go. Really long article! 

**Is Asia really lagging? Covid-19 pandemic finish line may farther think**

*Other regions appear left Asia dust race put pandemic behind us. Time tell.*

Across Asia-Pacific, several countries witnessed alarming new Covid-19 outbreaks recent weeks governments forced reimpose harsh anti-virus restrictions, people gazing envy side globe.

In United States, fully vaccinated Americans - nearly half population - revelling newfound freedom. hopping onto planes, cramming stadiums, flocking malls hosting celebratory parties send miserable year forced stay apart. Best all, casting masks.

Vaccinated individuals parts Europe, like Britain, France Germany, also spared cumbersome measures governed lives past year. curfews social limits, uncomfortable Covid-19 tests, travel quarantines most.

France - one every four people fully vaccinated - lifting night-time curfew outdoor mask mandate all, even yet get shots. Spain, 30 per cent population completed inoculation, same.

Why much Asia-Pacific region yet able likewise, despite countries lower infection fatality rates West?

After all, Asia-Pacific vaccination front runners well - even better - Western counterparts.

More third people Singapore already fully vaccinated. Elsewhere region, lagging behind second doses, 20 per cent 30 per cent South Korea, Hong Kong, Macau Australia received least one shot.

And judging total number doses administered China, least one three people first jab, second.

The statistics show vaccination works: Covid-19 deaths US - worst-hit country - slowed significantly.The death toll US topped 600,000 past week, taking four months add latest 100,000. stark contrast situation back winter, adding 100,000 deaths matter weeks.

Weekly new hospitalisations - indicating disease severity - dropped all-time low. Daily new cases month also fallen 7,000 peak 300,000 January.

For regions Asia, vaccine accessibility issue. life-saving shots cannot obtained quickly enough sufficient quantities - cases Thailand Vietnam - governments forced continue relying combination tight restrictions border controls.

But even vaccination progressing well, authorities still keeping social economic activities tether, like Australia, ever ready lock entire cities emergence handful new local cases.

South Korea took big steps easing measures last week, scrapping outdoor mask mandate least first jab, allowing 4,000 people attend K-pop concerts.

But daily new cases bouncing back 500 barely 8 per cent population fully vaccinated, remains seen locals tourists hurry flock back big events ditch mask-wearing, practice already widespread country pandemic.

**Vaccines cure-all**

Health policy management professor Peter Muennig Columbia University's Mailman School Public Health puts dichotomy government approaches caution versus recklessness.

""It's clear quite yet vaccination immediate reopening society thereafter way towards ending pandemic,"" said Professor Muennig, specialises analysing burdens disease written health implications associated different economic systems.

""I would want see infections drop substantially vaccination rates effective vaccines - mRNA-based vaccines - climbing 70 per cent considering safe drop public mask-wearing, (allow) big-group mingling, resume international travel,"" said.

""Otherwise, giving virus chance adapt vaccinated bodies. reckless.""

Vaccination alone cure-all. Neither preventive measure, own.

Experts like Professor Keiji Fukuda University Hong Kong's School Public Health point famously described ""Swiss cheese approach"" countering pandemic. layer pandemic defence holes, combined, block spread virus.

Prof Fukuda said: ""What countries strive (1) stepwise national strategy opening up; (2) high levels vaccination, probably range least 70 per cent; (3) functional surveillance system capable detecting increase cases; (4) health system capable handling significant increase cases; (5) strong communication initiative engages public private sector.""

Prof Muennig sees China one key example effectively implemented cautious approach, aided strong control borders, media messaging state apparatus. also massively scaled vaccination blitz, averaging whopping 17 million doses daily past week - almost total South Korea administered.

""China really done outstanding job government - extent people - would rather live restrictions like electronic monitoring, strict quarantine rules mandatory testing, die suffer lifelong disability,"" Prof Muennig said.

China's robust domestic tourism consumer markets also make ""unique remain economically prosperous closed borders,"" added.

The Chinese authorities even considering relaxing travel barriers.

""As long outbreaks remain uncontrolled outside borders, possible anywhere China, matter long local cases,"" Dr Wu Zunyou, chief epidemiologist Chinese Centre Disease Control Prevention, said last month justified keeping country's strict border controls. taken vaccine.

They one side taking far money (and far dark money). rich people paying government officials, specific government officials decided fuck average American party wants. get Covid vaccinated person, easily unvaccinated person. number studies indicating much vaccine reduces spread don’t numbers handy right now. rough. really hope vaccines go global already... understand havent really man. awful hear that.   People make lot 'slippery slope' arguments way scare people; like saw lot 'background checks lead forced gun repossession' 'gay marriage leads people marrying dogs'.

Honestly! mean asking questions? reputable journalist daily mail ""journalist""? 

It's blatantly unscientific think automatically give credence claim goes contrary accepted science. 

Let guess, think masks work one doctor somewhere Kansas said one cares Gibraltar Seychelles.

A runner buddy army, longer could pass pt tests. 

My dad’s older runner buddy, died quickly it. 

I got bad, wasn’t “runner” would run like 2 miles every days spare time. Ate well. amazing shape two kids imo. Got March ‘20. kinda lethargic bleh since. 

I got vaccine recently, got bad sick after, cdc called asked make report adverse reactions. Still sick. try function like one task time now. Sometimes manage walking outside 30 min. Sometimes don’t move whole day. 

It definitely hits certain people others, weird.

Oh like commenter smokers- mom caught ‘20 helped watch children went hospital. smokes lot... like little cold her. would pop DayQuil smoke away fine!  got second shot yesterday. first shot 3 weeks ago. call pharmacies knew dead hell lol Really? What's next slope? Meanwhile Cole Beasley rejected vaccine he'd rather die living. much fun living like man.  get colds like everyone else. uncommon would say. honestly can't remember last cold I've had. little cough something.

But I've never go see doctor emergently acute illness things like that. get yearly checkup that's it. high blood pressure, diabetes, I'm overweight, etc. run marathons, 5 10k's regularly, fish kayak, etc.

Think person know that's healthy exercises eats clean diet. I'm guy.    Canadian, would gladly switched places past year. means can’t see actual emoji. Like device specifically can’t see it, others can. haven’t updated iphone seeing stacked lines. know people waiting vaccine unsure. meantime wear masks, stay away people, everything protect otherwise. 
I chose vaccinated. long continue mind rules, understand choice even mine.


In news ...OMG get vaccine want act like deadly virus rampaging earth. ""But likely amongst tenants, stallholders staff working market food centre, close contact amongst would contributed exposure spread mask-off mask-on settings.""

Food centre.

Mask-off mask-on.

Not alarming, normal. important piece puzzle missing cytokine storm phenomenon. One reason healthy people poorly unhealthy people well fact immune system *too strong.* goes hyperdrive actually damages body. Whereas someone who's immune system tip top shape catches mild case may less likely cytokine storm. Hence fit runner getting severe case unhealthy smoker getting mild case.

Not protective unhealthy - - no, random thing.  Damn, know fall started July Chances people accepted vaccine theses type complications anyway. mention she’s 63 49. She’d bankrupt heading retirement age. Poverty incurable illness people stand rich. never discounted long COVID, wanted point hypochondria create fairly severe physical symptoms. Also, fact visit doctor get mind ease manifestation health anxiety. read subreddits dedicated people it, lots suffer, reassurance medical personnel help all. course do. think got position first place?  kids went day camp last summer, start back day camp tomorrow going overnight camp August.  They're looking forward mostly-normal summer fun long, challenging year school masks distancing.  

Last summer 1 covid case day camp, spread anyone else exposed cohort (all quarantined tested).  summer's exposure risk even lower, given low case rate high vaccine uptake area. terrible mismanagement. northeast US got areas 70% vaccinated short months. never sick day life, seriously

Sorry mean this? You’ve never bad cold anything? yes agree Florida gold ticket don’t mind banging senior citizen. Spend 6 months day Canada summer, ‘retire’ Florida winter. That's thing.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* I'm really happy you. thought lockdown January April would last one. already two covid shots (I deemed essential worker) grandparents, made think would lockdowns. Older people risk groups already vaccinated, essential workers too. Everything opening cases going up. opened British tourists, brought delta variant everything went crap. many people dying (I think 10 persons died entire week), cases rising lot migrant communities young people given opportunity vaccinated. Thanks offer, I'm allowed pm. trick keep letting spread! ‘Pop Squad’ Netflix’s “Love Death &amp; Robots” episode joke.. There’s difference labor force participation rate unemployment rate. Unemployment rate looks total number people still labor force don’t jobs particular moment, doesn’t factor stopped participating labor force due industries shuttered, longer looking work, etc. It’s also worth noting labor force participation rate number rolling figure - 40.8% dropped - measures rolling disruption American households instead considering someone “recovered” second find new job. though racist talking point months. Nurse here...and yes right really done studies antibodies vaccination, studies based post-covid infection antibodies show greater chance false negative false positive results. personal experience tested antibodies thru blood donation multiple times past year...I never Covid antibody tests negative last test 3 weeks post second dose Pfizer vaccine. positive. lowered anxiety level 100%. still wear mask indoors crowds people know stress level decreased knowing vaccination Correct I’m wrong isn’t purpose getting vaccinated keep vaccinated person getting really sick. mean, vaccinated people still get COVID. don’t get sick. get COVID vaccinated person easily unvaccinated person. vaccine doesn’t stop getting COVID. vaccine keeps COVID killing you. Christ. need tap internet good while, mania. 

You're fine. vaccines available US/EU good. Gatwick famously practically closed COVID. Huh.  Must nice. wish could vaccinated whole family worry. managed book second one 8 week interval.   mean, get vaccine probably should.

No harm it, it’ll keep safer.  husband wife’s pregnant friend… would reason 😂  Many places EU delaying 2nd dose. extreme Canada UK inititally, still. E.g. may use maximum interval approved EMA (12 weeks AZ, 6 weeks Pfizer Moderna).   Meanwhile getting COVID cause erectile disfunction. Glad I'm vaxed! Pfizer need keep masking well indoor crowded areas. Ahhh no. Currently unemployment 5.8 percent highest pandemic 14.8 That's drive big, know partially compensate numbers  PCR costs around 50€ Greece, fyi never claimed US handled pandemic well. whatever reason think places like Vietnam, Thailand, Australia, New Zealand excluding Americans welcoming people literally anywhere else planet open arms, know tell you. saying destroy children? Sorry that. US, us moved virus. many rather stay home, respect decision. his/her free choice.  Im Canadian, awesome job y'all catch gain immunity like virus. PM give one two tips :) depends want totally agree death rates extremely low, bonkers. think world leaders reaction we're already seeing UK and, worse extent, Portugal. People ones demanding freedom hate go cough deep fried cheese burger somebody else's throat. would draw distinction scientific developments evidence based medicine. know doctor said first days medical school (in 90s), told “Half teach wrong. don’t know half.” Much medicine based weak insufficient studies. human body complex make educated guesses many treatments don’t scientific rigor behind yet. Food insecurity 10.5%. insecurity quadrupled. unemployment record low March 2020. Currently r value germany 0.55, though. almost half cases week. Yeah. dont play game. respect virus gone way long now. cant live like forever. I‘m Greek life Germany. ensure necessary tip, also uncommon. really would think is: extra thank good service. always tip ~10% service good. better, slightly more! miserable, give nothing. Easy that. lung transplant walk park, survival 5 years still poor quality life low. Good live US, suppose. Here, respect lockdown, get huge fine jail, still resist go back home. live already can't leave district. police every single exit, stopping every single car... early year. depressing.  Good see numbers rising nicely. Yes%  variants never end. Haha bizarre, say wait longer? zero sum game, buddy. fact failed young people means failed rollout. End story. yet liberal federal government one best positions world. Maybe move Alberta.  Wonder numbers pre covid Irreparable lung damage. vent essentially breathing him. option get vaccinated also get deal consequences it

Sure, it'll blow back terms inconvenient protocols. make mistake decision affects everyone. Cole Beasley type thinking allowed get bad first place, prolong it. isn’t freedom, it’s health progress we’ve made. older people people pre-existing condition waiting longer vaccination better system?! react. Driving ratings $ Found anti vaxxer. Move along. Even much contagious variants largely prevented mitigated vaccines. It’s like we’re back situation pre-vaccine. Hey told over!! Open up! AMERICA NUMBER 1!! people outside richer countries never see single dose mRNA vaccines alot dumb people here. Hey told I'm going ignore science take horse old town road! really need address quality education next pandemic. social responsibility. expect worst outbreaks rural areas vaccinations low, people didn’t shit stop spread vaccines. They’re going anything now. 

Once mask mandates lifted full capacity events allowed, that’s it. There’s going back. mention targeting women people color. lets forget tend misogynists racists too, general assholes really. Burnout. Western world

Therein lies problem. Many developing countries problem. Pfizer AZ studied prevalent 

Pfizer gives approximate 88% protection two weeks second dose delta variant, 33% first dose.

Previous studies previous variants showed Moderna Pfizer similar responses due mRNA vaccines, likely Moderna yield results. old, already lived best years, whereas didn't. That's unfair. giving life whereas we're losing best years. fair? Lockdown THEM, us, anything. surprise. Literally one wears masks (no one nowhere, exaggerating). surprise though cases surge started now. I'm sure equally responsible people Florida... somewhere :)  US, NY Hancock said 1 5 cases delta hospitalisation people double vaccinated.

Got source that? That’s super interesting although Romania really far away lol. Romanian citizenship well? get Pfizer Astra? That's amount gave Trinidad Tobago!  Short answer, one knows. Long answer, one knows. might mutate much, might not. might happen month, might happen year.

It's certainly inevitable. even probable happen, possible. ""1 x"" people pretty common, although rarely see ""one two"", ""every other"" used well enough, substitute hard numbers, usually used call something common. still cant figure vaccination count discrepancy CDC data NJ DOH data, that's case across states data Vs. CDC data. Anyone know discrepancies exist? delta variant soon Europe. :-(

Deaths remain flatlined, though, places high vaccination. vaccines work fine. level ""openness"" affects total number cases, ratio strain strain B. tightly locked country, transmissible strain would still end dominating less transmissible strains, lower total case numbers. I'm guinea pig category. I'm 4 months vaccine (Pfizer.) thing indeed wear off, I'm one probably realize first. Even though I'm vaccinated, I'm still taking precautions. crowded places indoors wear mask. Outdoors I'm go normal business.

But minute see problems got jabbed first, I'm signing booster. even summer yet, yet comparing summer 🤣 get vaccinated. Seems reasonable. **almost** like someone (Russia) funding disinformation campaigns weaken enemies political divide leading authoritarianism. Weird, eh? still wear mask like covers face don’t feel pressure put makeup go worry tired look Sure, Reddit. Insurance companies need make Covid exclusion willfully unvaccinated. hurt anyone makes complete sense get many vaccinated possible given public facing role?

Engage brain. fact, it’s completely appropriate reasonable prevent spread virus (and appurtenant stupidity). like mainstream media track -- again. Check daily Vaccine Trackers (NYT etc) see last two weeks vaccination rates climbing. Substantially.

Think - search believe data, reporters. That's mandate lol. I'm glad stupid ass phrase cars. People would love demand taxi rides every conceivable ""service"" phrase Unfortunately, future generations also stupid fuck,and history repeat used COVID related stuff, sure want else do? could ask question internet still free place right?  data. Yeah that's point. Delta variant pushed hard media people repeating anecdotes data actual data support claims. 75% residents vaccinated large percent health care staff refuse vaccination, risk still high. financial restraints staffing issues, use rapid covid test might feasible. would taken ten seconds find  Guy said bad vaccines aren’t effective China it’s better take  sad sad story. Thanks. genetically predisposed blood clots. I'm taking chances. taking action that’s actually useful, like upgrading ventilation systems, essentially invisible.

And often times much expensive spraying sidewalk soapy water. Unfortunately often safety theater used place actual safety measures rather addition them. Never go full Jacksonville False, hospital capacity local. southern community 30% vax rate also likely one single hospital region. Yeah. days biggest enemy conspiracy theories. People countries begging advanced vaccines, ungrateful people causing much harm avoiding it.  Holy shit...

I spent one week home spending another two weeks hospital fucking virus. another two weeks home. laid down. lost 8kg muscles it’s 6 weeks left hospital I’m still struggling lungs, heart liver (oh, cherry top, free hepatitis Covid induced) also legs « injured »!

Can’t imagine guy through... vaccines SEA great thing see links kidding. friend ok. Zuckerberg all.  want say understand feel. one make feel bad cautious. It’s like virus first started afraid much didn’t know. Right don’t solid comfort J&amp;J. It’s ok careful, it’s ok take care yourself. keep makes comfortable feel safe (which time, know sucks, wait little longer information), you’ll able everything again. Thank getting vaccine part solution! sad. Shows real impact covid had, guy got near beginning!  explain Delta variant arising India massive outbreaks South Southwest US last summer? absolute scariest thing disease: _you don’t get choose_. There’s consistent evidence better cardiovascular shape _always_ helpful. Friend mine knows late-30s guy marathon runner excellent shape also spent almost two weeks ventilator.

I know it’s anecdotal would rather anecdote “the pandemic sucked I’m ok” “I needed lung transplant.”  yeah sure like that.

97% workplace vaccinated. 3% probably people situations preventing getting it. operating like normal. dont wear mask anywhere anymore. essentially me.

Anyone holding vaccines idiot. readily available. Go get shot things normal too. Also like I'm shocked they're vaccine mandate like care human lives.  UK numbers hospitalisation (only I've seen) showing hospitalisation rate line vaccine efficacy hopefully Delta wave start really 'living' also think EU country relying AZ - shipping addition Pfizer Moderna

Back vaccines ordered countries - especially poorer ones - reduced share mRNA vaccines ordered AZ promised massive quantities low prices. dont think anyone relied solely AZ, share vaccine differed countries. Thats also Malta far ahead - bought lot mRNA vaccine share others didnt want. odd sentiment…I’m sure thought vaccine doesn’t let live life? anything it’s opposite since don’t worry catching covid.  Politics aside, also dangerous practical level. virus keeps spreading within parts American populous, new variants inevitably emerge. 

I medical professional, specialised knowledge medical field. point, even difficult task accomplish, appears thing put nail coffin well eradicate danger completely would new medicine/a cure COVID-19. Let's hope science successfully get us situation soon again. Vast majority delta cases among unvaccinated though. says risk similar (not lower)

Is good enough kids return normal life? seemingly worried actual documented long term (or could long term seeing aren’t psychic) side effects covid. Make make sense. interesting minor change could yield vastly different results. Reading article, seems CureVac even uses lipid nanoparticle coating. everyone get vaccinated. Herd immunity protects defenceless among us.  report American Academy Pediatrics summarize: children (under 18 variations) hospitalization rates 1-2% tota hospitalization ratel. (Even though 18 group probably 20% total population probably exposed average). Death rate 0.1% total. And, believe AAP report, covid19 risk children without vaccination probably lower vaccination

Also, US CDC covid19/flu/pneumonia death flu deaths GREATLY suppressed last year (yet 1/2 covid19 deaths 18 group) Yeah, pretty close family friend diagnosed January. would state's first phase pretty much said she'd first line take it.

On vent maybe week later dead days that. Shortly died vaccine rollout started. ah ok, looking global approach suppose now

idk people think vaccine makes invincable current cases unvaccinated give antivax vibes, although abit different

thank's help, hope get message across rely cases excuse drag thing forever didn’t tell us?


[Truth father purposefully resisting vaccine. Idk wtf problem is. ton pre-existing conditions would make getting COVID lethal him. doesn’t care.

Given I've done bare minimum duty society vaccinated. people given task caring vulnerable society declining obligation protect rampant disease. Calling plague rats kind, pretty common knowledge ever since variants first started showing up. Instead asking stranger reddit work making aware world around you, look ? makes 30s took find widely dispersed information drastic acceleration variant integration, must reinfections. turns out, may driving force. Dr. Faria noted likelihood cases observed P.1’s spread past months reinfections. likelihood derived antibody effectiveness six times weaker P.1 comparison previous SARS-CoV-2 infections seem protect reinfection, yet vaccines remain seen.

That article published March 10th, 2021. we've since found out, vaccines robust variants natural infection. particular, mRNA vaccines astounding results nitric oxide Personally pay $70 per paycheck every week even still cant afford testing/labs/radiology. need get ekg blood work costs $120 $150. don’t money like throw around. Oh man sorry hear that. 27 year old health issues perfectly healthy? initial vaccine trials track fertility, statistical difference number pregnancies control

(It certainly protect majority though. I'm sure we'll seeing tons data soon) Sequenced cases delta variant UK doubling every week so. 99% rate would seem check since 90% sequenced cases 10-14 days ago. atleast big advocate getting vaccine 79% close enough... Whats considered young? 40? it’s related study found. Thanks. I'm sure reliable source is, ironically, says risk similar (not lower), still, Children much danger virus. That's clinical testing vaccines children last to-do list.

Right, know. must people continually exaggerate new cases Israel. flatlined months. right, unfortunately big chunk western population illnesses. heartbreaking. Poor family. RIP bud “Tonnes” spelling mistake. spelled correctly. could I’m sure find statistics find futile arguing you. sounds you’re saying healthy people don’t get seriously sick — know people super healthy, ended seriously sick ventilator almost dying.

Rest Peace, TMR Cosine!! sad lose great person 😢 I’m thankful majority family took thing seriously never got Covid, couple they’re ones didn’t believe it. Estimates: 80% need vacinated herd immunity. “narrative” might be?  Ok, well guess done now, then? 

I gave framework I'm applying (which takes account things mentioned like hospital capacity takes account hospitalizations), pretty clearly need data. 

I want make something clear may missed based comment - I'm talking going forward, delta variant. I'm talking countries like UK Cananda took chance likely worked becuae ahead double-vaccinating already time seeing delta variant.  Sensible decision Upvote Vanilla Covid.

Vaccines less effective R values higher non vaccinated. don’t remember claims 50% effectiveness 70% vaccination rates meaning heard immunity. fact numbers would pretty much guarantee never reaching heard immunity 35% population would effectively immunized. third UK nearly half US hypertension, ditto obese, etc. also humans deserving care compassion, perhaps? Yep. we’d told year ago vaccine 50% effective preventing symptomatic infection, extremely effective preventing serious illness hospitalization, we’d moon.

It’s Pfizer Moderna come ridiculously effective Sinovac suddenly seems “bad”.  really is. Staying topic, resorting excessive profanity filler words, breath control voice projection diaphragm, maintaining constant barrage yelling opportunity refute offered. Hello, Chris Traeger Protect serve.  young, healthy vaccinated, go day variant even exist likely bias Vegan people, sticks they're likely let know ""abnormal"" remember it. bad thing, important spread information harmless virus healthy. logical someone horrible position likely want share contradiction, often hear ""yeah outlier"" said loud, outliers speak up. Yes no. Yes, there's data show large portion could simply younger people ones vaccinated yet.

I go uk data since following there's enough say affecting young original virus.

Don't know peer reviews especially hospitalisation young clearly affecting them. Thank you! actually Argentinian study. 78% first dose. See LA overridden Brazilian variant, talk current Russian wave caused Delta variant. estate would liquidated cover unpaid debts family gets anything. people latent health/genetic conditions know become apparent get covid.  $ Pretty much experience well. mentality led preventable deaths prolonging pandemic; trying get like talking tree. beyond frustrating, worth effort engaging. Let’s bring thread poor patient, cares tax codes amounts? Yep. kids people extreme allergic reactions vaccinations past, wish could get vaccine, don’t want risk it. I've noticed thing. fairly strong immune system, maybe gotten sick 10 times 26 years, knocked ass 2nd shot. Never felt like  idea would require vaccines school young age, you’d vaccinated adult later life activities mentioned.

I get it’s 1:1. point I’m making counter “slippery slope” argument already vaccine mandates degree. COVID vaccine mandate would invasive.

And “slope” “the government mandates health standards protect general population global pandemic” I’m totally that. run, vape also incredibly messed immune system (chronic angioedema, Raynaud's, endometriosis, histamine intolerance, possible rheumatoid arthritis fibromyalgia well)


When pandemic first hit assumed would fine since work much, eat great, healthy weight etc. started reading papers cytokine storms started get bit jumpy. advised get vaccine immunologist risk enough data people health issues.


Anyway got first vaccine month ago apart kept extended observations fine. Arm hurt lot days.


Crazy stuff though. I'm opposite end spectrum, let preface fact live Tennessee bible supposedly heals all. two managers previous job thought nothing, different reasons. One manager, major steakhouse chain, believes Bill Gates helped fund vaccination implant chips people carried cell phone around daily. supposedly dated nurse, last long, continually claimed patients virus harmless/mythical flu deaths decreased year. B.S. chemistry pharmaceutical background, kinds people set ways believe people understand stuff works. Mother's husband almost died it, lost sense taste. sad part ones need weeded rarely ones do. Bezos would trouble bill icu stay long.  held tongue

That's best approach people, they're beyond able grasp common sense, talking nothing frustrate even more. Trust me, I've got close family members joined idiots. really chance talking concrete wall.  board plane, attend event, job. Also, ways around school required vaccines. disagree basic idea, cautious. not. job enforce laws. Maybe COVID, plenty people need lung transplants reasons. don’t secure funding *first* can’t get transplant US 🙃 need lung transplant (at least many states) it’s pretty much auto accept disability *hopefully* can’t afford it/insurance won’t cover default state healthcare. Afterwards things like pulmonary rehab, physical therapy etc (which crucial recovery) often covered however. 

Source: double lung transplant ~7 years ago.  now. pro vaccine got needed transplant Covid harms men women, need adequate reparations. Sad story. May rest peace. single peer reviewed study shows this? sources statement I've seen politicians none mentioning study. Ok, bud. Genetics plays role, healthy life style definitely helps too. rarely get sick less healthy lifestyle doesn’t mean healthier lifestyle doesn’t help prevent people getting sick. Anecdotal evidence doesn’t count source. actually announcement proudly pretty much unsolicited. talking another neighbor weather, neighborhood, general BSing, worked conversation. also offered thinks AARP liberal conservative alternative (she's older, 70s guess).

She friends. wear mask feel sick general. hope wearing mask sick becomes common over. least coming over.

Is US terms impactful threat economic engine medical capacity? simple fact defeat vaccine, likely develop boosters, rapidly improve therapuetics tells is. 

Will people still hospitalized die COVID every day next 10 years? Yes, definitely will. However, simple fact weapon works goes long way towards preventing happened 2020-early 2021 best tool disposal conducive natural human behavior.   already vaccine requirements children attend schools. Requiring COVID vaccine different. also Ukraine, sadly almost vaccinated people.

&amp;#x200B;

So far Poland cases seem keep getting lower, even almost full opening up. don’t Delta variant yet, though…

&amp;#x200B;

(On hand way deaths, since larger portion vulnerable people yet vaccinated).

&amp;#x200B;

Personally, think it’s better 50% age groups vaxxed 95% older ones. UK little population immunity among young yet, Poland closer herd immunity.   Yes course access country literally can't get one right want entirely different absolutely fault. That's comment said ""unvaccinated choice"". also got covid January, don’t think refused vaccine. He’s pro vaccine article.  pretty important ability. Without end yelling incoherently collapsing profanity. one feels stupid you. Source: Me. Selfish vaccinate yourself? get vaccinated want it'll protect yourself, leave everyone else alone France invade island. Normans invaded spoke French.  I’ve bilateral lung transplant, I’m fully vaccinated - Europe they’re giving people like 3+ boosters US doesn’t give fuck. 

Also guy got covid January, vaccine even viable then? needed transplant pro-vaccine, don’t think article represented truthfully. It’s pretty much big City London.. big city, yet still city. 40%+ brazilians received least one dose vaccine (50M people).   American Republicans gladly sacrifice lives millions Americans direct lies helps bank accounts political power. shameful elected officials allowed voluntarily vaccinated stance implying vaccines bad (without evidence) still elected office there's problem there. Really is. caught January even feel cough. headache, sleepiness, stuffy nose. best friend caught (we work together) full horrible fever. bad enough go hospital lot worse did. weird problem EMT's/Paramedics come contact lot frail elderly/immuno-compromised patients may fully protected vaccine, especially Delta variant. Unless there's requirement test unvaxxed first responders every single day there's chance could asymptomatic unknowingly sicken patients responding call. go running presymptomatic peak viral shedding, drawing lots viral particles deep lungs...  CA, guidance basically classrooms, childcare, place mainly deals children enforce masks indoors. Outside, like playgrounds, there’s longer enforcement masks/social distancing.  naive statement. greed rich people 100% saw opportunity capitalize human suffering. That's unfortunate natural occurrence, that's instilled US government. decision British government go nowhere near lose-lose situation. vaccinate children get accused allowing vaccine spread, use vaccines children get accused compassion adults third world desperate vaccines. decision experts. dont give shit. nothing change least 50% politicians want base. 

nothing change. 
a catastrophic global pandemic isnt enough half population act someone else's interest. Yep, go speech therapy this.

Yep, article mentions understand better, they're treating essentially head injury. hope recover! huh 

never said anything even close  don’t mind, antivax status get brought up? roll welcome wagon, felt need tell you? roll welcome wagon, feel need ask? overhear talking phone? Yup I'm careful can. Sadly I'm living house people careful, avoided staying room, I'm moving soon fingers crossed escape.

I'm taking LFT tests every day got first dose booked Friday. Fortunately cyclist, socialising outdoors people equally sensible. guess makes sense. Definitely confusing choice words though. Thanks! plans US lift travel restrictions UK probably hold till least September, since need get Delta variant control. sending alerts limits easier requiring masks indoors? least crowded places like transport shopping?    saying different strains contagious deadly back March 2020 first “Italy” variant. actually gone scale rather trying extrapolate data, really haven’t much different. need empathy Call night surgeon! Yep, go speech therapy this. rival nation state interested weakening USA. Honestly, mutation renders current vaccines completely useless highly unlikely foreseeable future, especially taking low case counts areas high share vaccinated individuals account.

If country high enough vaccination rate stop uncontrolled, exponential spread population, there's little reason abolishing measures mask mandates, prohibiting larger parties festivals, least vaccinated individuals.  Even New York QR code isn’t permanent. reapply months.  Don’t blame decision slightest. Can’t imagine pain gone well family. Cried reading honestly. I'm 47 years old never sick day life, seriously.

Sorry buddy, stop reading this. remember Swine Flu. good chunk home town got it. Knocked flat a$$ week. Ended closing schools everything.

A week later, flu vaccine available.

Covid-19 around twice contagious ""the flu"", around 10 20 times deadly. mean *might* get lucky asymptomatic, flu, fun.

I think right. people saying ""iT's fLu!!!"" likely know difference common cold influenza. probably also think take antibiotics cure ""the flu"".  need learn live move vs. need keep hammering goes back before.

 Considering one side based facts one based FUD, see holding equivalence 2 positions. Funnily enough, mega churches states like one would expect least vaccinated populations gather share viral load. interesting see fare delta variant.  Yeah weird, son got too, sense's thing small caugh. sure understand comment. mean, people need double lung transplant bad condition, definition. makes man worse? aren’t vaccinated. feel literally sympathy people refuse shot.

Wow can’t even imagine. poor wife think able see hold hand. COVID really terrible nightmare many. Thank goodness pulled through.  Hmm guess we’re interpreting text differently. Hope that’s really case.

Does QR code even work though? It’s working people tried scan other’s.     know…a lot. Three coworkers, half family, many friends. Luckily, one died. one friends got February 2020 suffering long term symptoms ever since, she’s late 20s. retrovirus present human genome going back thousands years

Sadly, longhaul symptoms like yours. need start job soon, (serving feet day) I'm really worried I'll exhausted days get it. Also get tired nowadays get almost delirious, brain fog. Feeling almost stoned. experience this? Opinions [Sydney reimplementing indoor mask mandate nine Necessary move complete overreach?   Doctors gaslight patients like bitchslapped 6 month suspensions licenses... Stop touting nonsense. HQC nothing  Damn sucks. feel bad people live places vaccines available. read many examples people thought the(a) C-vaccine helped Long-Covid symptoms........ I'm sure eventually vaccine made delta variant, show problem. I'm vaxed covid think stupidity transmittable way, can't careful dealing idiots. Actually, probably fully vaxed childhood things like measles, mumps, rubella, smallpox, polio, etc. makes refusal problematic/sad/hypocritical/ironic (I decide adjective). read post somewhere think real can't see 

By logic, fine Chernobyl guess hospitals stop accepting unvaccinated patients. pro-choice. choice unvaccinated. Chinese doctors first tackled Covid noticed even published paper year ago, smokers suffering far less virus weird reason. need deny, pop back backup list. organ shows there's one else take it, might well give them, last choice. Many people never need anribiotics entire life. would died them. lot.

I think genetic factor play role, blood type does, deficency like vitamin d. Life finally back normal.. I'm saying goodbye Covid subreddit!! feel sorry you, please say jealous. Indeed. many countries, urgency vindicates use Sinovac, since need prevent wave death hospitalizations. Ummmm......have read many stories getting vaccinated helped long-COVID symptoms......... vaccine wont effective anymore, circular argument. True, big difference two.   One easy policy: hospitals accept new patients unvaccinated. wonder hospital mcdonald's style sign saying 1 billion served. government CDC said everyone risk everyone lockdown, would much better time dealing beginning.

No wouldn’t. People would quickly recognize they’re lied stop listening entirely. Honesty best policy long run. keep hearing young healthy people won’t die it, I’m skeptical. happen know healthy? We’re obese? need find better social circle. :/  need hang around perceptive people. simply rich hold lot stocks stockmarket soared regardless pandemic. iirc, similar happened Spanish Flu, well, since different waves different mortalities. Spanish Flu hit younger people harder 3rd year, killed due cytokine storms (hyperactive immune response constantly re-infected again), technically body killing itself... years 1 2 affected mostly older immunocompromised people like Covid currently does. thought process really hurt us. largely proved covid stronger effect older people, younger people get mild symptoms, transmit older people. real danger. entire age group running around spreading covid think ""no big deal"" follow proper lock guidelines.

If government CDC said everyone risk everyone lockdown, would much better time dealing beginning. I'm inclined believe amount exposure initially receive makes difference. immune system race virus likely win, virus starts small exposure. Get face full virus, starts position strength, easily overwhelming immune system initial days weeks meaning immune system goes overdrive, increases danger. bet big part answer people end like person, people experience virtually symptoms all, going come much virus initially infected with.

Unfortunately there's obvious (ethical) way prove even test theory. Meanwhile, I'm fat, hormone lung issues, effect vaccine could feel ""kinda feels like bruise put needle in"".

The inconsistency COVID everything related freaks hell out, uncertainty. know, second dose make sick weeks. know, vaccinate catch COVID, could end bit cough, could end life support.

I'd much rather diseases consistent.  Free vaccines age group available here, they're available paper. However, private hospitals AstraZeneca available chargeable. 

For covid recovered one jab adequate believe per video: 18% people 12+ British Columbia fully vaccinated past Friday we've used 93% vaccines delivered us we're need promised big shipments next week. work lady casually said “oh hahaha, know don’t believe covid” maybe 2 months ago really stuck me. She’s bad lady educated. work tech. couldn’t even respond floored would say that. lost handful Indian coworkers needed return home care extended families. asked evidence response ""do research!"" link valid 24 hours. say qr code expires. also avoid could carrying number preventable diseases many Americans afford major healthcare incident even insurance. guessing can’t either means declare bankruptcy let society foot bill recklessness, work hospitals make payment plan paying probably rest life.

The healthcare fallout covid us decades. People got sick never fully recovered needed long term care strain labor, cost society long term care. excuse point vaccines available. took minute, MTA backwards ATM.... vaccine trials, people received vaccines died Covid. That’s vaccines labeled 100%

The answer isn’t infinite lockdowns, answer restrict Covid small pockets, open up.

Problem is, vaccinated people interact unvaccinated people, likely vaccinated people get asymptomatic infections, would fine, except virus grow unvaccinated people become virulent. Rinse repeat get resistance current vaccines.

The problem never people dying, problem time, everyone vaccinated vulnerable again. super sad even worse fact hundreds thousands people living long term care facilities ventilators, still affected covid. guy still hospital US, someone trached ventilator could go care facility live indefinitely. silver lining Mr Kelk’s case able make wishes known family followed them. I’ve seen many patients living vegetative state life support years family didn’t know didn’t care patient wanted.  teeter back forth “no sympathy” “pity lack science understanding”. fault don’t understand don’t spend time research better understand. Somewhat, fully. younger person unit, admitted covid, hospitalized 1600 hours. 65 days. covid free, entire situation really sad ☹️  Except IS, quite literally, weeks. matters.

I say ""a weeks"" last year. I'm saying NOW, ARE, literally, weeks broader opening making sense. MAYBE two months.

But say error. Say I'm making mistake here, it'll longer.

What's objection overabundance caution?

Would rather people die haircut? argument making?

Is wearing little piece cloth arduous travail gonna cry online?

Are angry public officials want safe?

Oh boo hoo hoo.

Like gain anything angering people like you. motivations try help. Obviously. Jesus Christ.

That's we've ACTUALLY learned, come it, pandemic. people always give shit selfish needs saving lives countryfolk.

And then, that, they'll shame people point bullshit semantics instead catching point, could save lives at-best mild inconveniences another weeks, months, however fuck long, one should. guy friends group lost mother covid-19. friends group still refuse believe covid-19 claim regular flu. Pardon

The source single vaccine dose rises effectiveness 33% reduction symptomatic cases 14 days PHE study everyone else sure exactly meant 45% number, recent preprint study suggests 94% effectiveness 1 dose Pfizer reducing dose first still best public health strategy enable reopenings. second dose pivot mostly matter practicality. lot easier distribute increased shipment among willing volunteers laggards bothered yet Thank do. imagine received high exposure (high viral load) occupation, give virus opportunity overwhelm anyone's immune system (obviously). I'm sure difficult tease statistics have, studies ethical do, surprised medical personnel front lines generally worse outcomes, irrespective risk factors. hope continue improve. really sad.

You tell man wants live.

But realized stuck ventilator rest life good.

Made bravest decision end burden family further.

Rest peace.  new cases UK amongst 39 younger, group least vaccinated (last time checked less 30% group vaccinated). need keep vaccinating everyone fast can. experience. really hard wish 50+ year olds (my peers) social media saying ""it's bad"" would denied vaccine, could find out. obnoxious hear people privilege dealing (ever, now) casual harm done millions others. deniers, sure, know personally, makes believe smallish vocal minority. know plenty ""minimizers"" though. Finalist least surprising news item month. Oh agree full-heartedly. wanted make sure people knew wasn’t given clean slate.

Honestly, need real repercussions vaccinated be. Increased insurance premiums, withheld medical service, etc. shouldn’t collectively pay individual stupidity selfishness others. Let natural selection run it’s course. ""Being declined enter airlines"" likely happen *not* vaccinated. kook person is. interesting, I’m immunosuppressed (from medication treat autoimmune disease) reaction either vaccine shot. healthier coworkers pretty bad reactions. someone addressed this, yes comment bit confusing! definitely meant breakthrough infection despite fact fully vaxxed (mRNA). seems information whether people get covid fully vaxxed suffer form long haul symptoms. Well, admit I’m probably bias, can’t imagine, based approval polling, high. But, it’s possible live echo right here. 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼 Arent Myammar? end India? there's people reason worried rights. "" right wear mask/ get vaccine."" strange people. long covid??? multiple neighbors claim breath virus flu goverment created steal houses money.

Yes, I'm Florida whole purpose vaccinations reduce number deaths. UK strategy far effective. Spain also well. seen lower number deaths past weeks.

What criticise government basically make free all. technologically educated better connected get vaccinated earlier date. Yes getting vaccines arms. getting right arms. young people like self getting them. 60s still gotten theirs.

In NRW done first vaccinations weeks now. That’s terrible. Impressive Hes also relatively young otherwise good health bumping list...I'm glad able still around tragic many people dont get luxury. see there. Oh wow realize Canada mixing vaccines standard protocol. Good guys. allow wishing harm others sub. Comment removed per rule 1. know it’s evolved countries fewer vaccinated individuals delta already starting spread US. I’m sure it’s matter time get plus variant well. 2 months ago, people scrambling opportunity get vaccine, wouldn’t worried, US hit massive wall terms vaccine demand seems yet find way encourage unvaccinated percentages population get fuck get shot. vaccines incredible I’m thankful mine, they’re perfect, I’m concerned eventually get variant overcomes vaccine we’re allowing time figure perfect mutation. I’m starting believe either bots folks personal agendas spew bullshit. normal person time crap. Move lives people! site loaded many ads quickly caused site crash repeatedly. joke. point half websites ad farms copy paste stories between. It’s seriously making hate internet. first coronavirus humanity ever successfully treated vaccine, think expect there's going lot know mutation rate ability evade vaccines.

As purely scientific inquiry would agree, public health stand point stand apply precautionary principle given risks unknowns. know fact vaccine efficacy reduced variants, pretending like risk maybe next mutation benign seems extremely naive.

Given slow science study things, time learn fucked, late anything. prefer we, vaccinate quickly keep cases best never find out. AC private homes still common luxury Mediterranean countries. Many homes them, all, single room house (ensuring everybody stays together cool room house close doors). would long dead. unvaccinated going hurt vaccinated regardless whatever attitude have.

As individual yes. collective, support local, state, national institutions focus getting people vaccinated. form media campaigns (Elvis getting polio shot live tv), incentives (vaccine lottery!), outreach (mobile vaccination buses rural low income 3 months produce brand new targeted mRNA booster need it.

Consider this... revaccinate entire world 3 months? Imagine nice would be. Plus happen US would financially bankrupt. Unless extremely wealthy hospital bill destroy him. would thought could gone badly /s one said smartest bunch. sure make lot $200k/yr. Per Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) used collect reports adverse events vaccination general public. primarily used identify potential topics investigate regards vaccine reactions.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* VAERS reporting people getting numbers believe hit hard people? Incredibly sad story.  people even know flu is. get cold respiratory bug go ""i've got flu"". People get hospitalized die flu time. live privileged life. Like Netherlands, bar long wait shots. Hermits also bear mind r/Trypanophobia full people facing/trying face phobias get vaccine despite extreme fears know vaccination important It’s prevention. last questions: hospitalizations stay low matter. early say that. UK cases exploding, hospitalizations still relatively low. hope, careful mistakes last three waves.  job literally protect public. Yes. course, Line duty death die Covid-- also disability long term issues. 

It's costing taxpayer billions dollars. Covid biggest killer cops far -- even things combined. unknown bit, vaccine would impact infection rates. since ~April pretty clear vaccination *drastically* reduces risk infection. reason numbers daily cases fallen US? Social distance (kinda- folks well) + Vaccine (a lot)

If anyone comes contact strong enough loading dose, contract COVID. Vaccinated people fortified immune system, much harder covid make beachhead landing. 100% impossible, really really really unlikely. Covid going magically disappear, point need reopen country. many months since alpha took EU, since gone fast - long summer. Since then, vaccinated lot see greater effect seasonality.

Sure, contagious, every day passing protected.

One thing kept mind well cases translate hospitalizations deaths extent before, thanks primarily vaccines also better treatment. Countries made wise decision prioritize greatest risk.

Even cases rise, really matter much effect hospitalizations deaths would similar flu society level? variant evolved India low percentage population vaccinated, due hesitancy due unavailability supply.

While understand frustration vaccine-refusers USA, global perspective much bigger problem large unvaccinated population developing countries, like massive petri dish virus develop new mutations.

If true new delta+ variant mutation beta variant, means AstraZeneca vaccine, majorly administered India far, might less effective it. clear mRNA vaccines effective far preventing spread COVID. think important thing done right massive, coordinated effort deliver proven effective mRNA vaccines every corner globe vaccinate many people possible it. prevent new variants developing taking us back square one. Yes, expensive yes, rich countries foot bill. It'll still better everyone long run. guys see negative way reported world media?  Vaccines still job.

""Getting back normal"" may never possible high percentages people vaccinated. Apparently not. federal site must wrong. Would classify journalists writing potential blood clotting issues heart inflammation issues enemies state, destabilizing roll outs? It’s blatantly unscientific accept anything, everything questioned issues brought light. Saying it’s treason ask questions really reminds folks murdered church heresy.
Science asking questions, it’s religion. Go Canada! awsome. hope take vaccine surprisingly high number people anti-vaxxers also getting vaccine yet. say ""yet"" want certain comfortable regards possible adverse impacts move forward getting it. Agree disagree, uncomfortable thing people. Media plays big part well, things. Daniel Griffin hero work covid taking time put podcasts spread knowledge practitioners. understanding SARS/Covid viruses different things like cold flu. lot humans can't develop proper antibody without vaccine. stands reason almost bit like Russian Roulette going it. might fight right away, might tear you. Thanks explanations! glad I’m getting second shot today! addition others said people wanting cause division instability, there’s also fact scaring people profitable.

Setting conspiracy websites make outlandish claims generates lot internet traffic, websites sell products themselves, even run ads, lot revenue collected. would money let them? need talked that? seem fine own. guess also depends live, define ""huge portion."" people getting vaccinated. (Canada) I'm vaccinated, older members family.  Case rates low region (thanks vaccination natural immunity) I'm also worried kids young vaccinated, especially since risk posed covid healthy children extremely low.

So no, I'm worried catching covid. nice get back normal life. general scientific consensus understand mixture both. Think as, probability seriously ill higher people weaker immune systems (which obvious statement) even stronger immune systems susceptible succumbing weakest viruses, it’s probability lower course. probably significant enough. people get upset others want take vaccine non medical reasons. Talk Americans destroying America you? Bah - can't find damn tweet, someone near top healthcare system showed critical surgeries back, medium low still like ~70-90% down.

Lets assume topline 90% hospitalization efficacy true one-dose. still leaves 10% one-dose, still 33% population unvaccinated (the focus eligible kind dumb people still get infected spread).

Trevor good map rough coverage have: *top line* ~50%. 2-3 weeks far far robust. charge peoples conversation. OMG. remember hearing news year ago someone relatively young lung transplant Covid destroyed lungs.

Organ transplants like getting new tires car, last resort massive consequences impacts health. body recognizes transplant foreign even blood type take immune system suppressing drugs body attack it. top transplanted organs last many years number significantly shorter average life span. coworker transplanted liver life easy constant health issues. I'd terrified health situation required transplant. new lungs start work?

For matter, hip knee replacements similar. last many years get 2nd knee replacement 3rd really risky. think unlikely. However, also depends live states. states never really imposed much way restrictions begin others did. things get really bad reason, states previously imposed might (my state one restricted ones, we're pretty much reopened except mask requirements certain environments, state left door open things get bad again). Yeah anti-vax conspiracies really dumb. least part blame government media untrustworthy past. Maybe lot blame.

Of course entities never blame though, also control nearly news analysis see...

I also think sheer scale rollout lets us see sorts rare side effects clinical trials regular rollouts would never uncover. Unfortunately think one wants point leads conclusion vaccines medications severe rare side effects. thought back non critical surgeries? 

I open interpretation though. hope really solid fast reopening plans ICUs recovered. you’re vaccinated, even 1 dose, likely dodge hospitalization catch COVID. thing holding us back hospital capacity Ford reopened early February  anecdotal, early relatives China thinking ""Why bother vaccine, COVID thing months.""

But saw happened India, like ""Yeah, we're getting jabbed."" Would love know. I’m getting married August want make sure extra safe go maskless :)  choosing get much dangerous disease. Great logical thinking going there. shit? would people poorly Covid poorly virus, process completely random? kids wear masks inside required to, outdoors. 

We nearly every adult kids spend time vaccinated months. high vaccine uptake rate here, state city low case rates (our city 65K averaging around 4 cases week).  Frankly, odds encountering asymptomatic-but-contagious covid case setting that's high risk transmission extremely low.  real-world efficacy masks high, especially younger children can't wear handle correctly. 

While know ""mask forever"" crowd like admit it, masks lot downsides - especially children. feel tiny incremental risk reduction worth kids, especially 15+ months. still much less risky side effects Covid. Epsilon variant incoming.  deaths take weeks month report TBH, UK's wave would start show deaths (if spreading elderly, fortunately really doing) Hey man told I'm going ignore now! meant medical reasons. many kids died MN Covid?

Well, either 

1. Covid19 sufficiently dangerous children, vaccination clearly beneficial

2. dangerous children, restrictions clearly unneeded

And, really wish investigation/trials different dosage/vaccine spacing young. cold like side effects often severe enough discourage vaccination severity/frequency seems greater younger people (if 1% chance 3-days high fever vaccination, covid suddenly might seem like better option)..

Theres fixing revision. Amputation next step  reason refusing get vaccine prevent sorts things, I'm logical them. Somehow need explain use tinfoil help conspiracy geared minds understand vital get shot. fact numbers would pretty much guarantee never reaching heard immunity 35% population would effectively immunized.

This makes sense. measles vaccine 99% effective still need 90%+ population prevent outbreaks (but also contagious). that's remember seeing fall. FDA said would approve vaccines least 50% effective everyone talking 70% herd immunity magic number. [See case numbers rocketed [see vaccination rates 

Comparing vaccination rates, Europe think get worse much quickly. Prepare another wave, starting 3-4 weeks progression UK guide. Honestly blows mind many people still actively resisting vaccine, year much hardship everyone.

Also, point out, many rural counties Michigan state average vaccinations higher.

Of course vaccines still offer great degree protection!   True. vaccine still around [75% effective Delta fully vaccinated may initial 95%, mean 75-80% fully vaccinated enough? Scientists talking 50% effectiveness fall 70-90% herd immunity. 75% till higher 50%. yet people still don’t wanna get vaccinated.
