That's far everyone. qualify conditions, list including lots people really help. Aug. 30, 2021 Don’t worry, it’ll affect us vaccinated, too. mutates, breakthrough cases. logical, bizarrely research back up. Don’t think probably won’t time due sample size issues among probably reasons like trials mixed doses. dismiss ""'no shit' news"". course know vaccines work extremely well. nailing exactly *how* well proven difficult, especially confounding factor Delta variant. high-quality data subject always welcome. Though, lot cases someone gotten shot, gotten sick worse two weeks passed still documented unvaccinated.

I've also seen too, without boosters, considered unvaccinated well. 

I find strange Israel one highest vaccination rates still reports high cases  Oh c’mon!

You zero ground stand calling anyone out. don’t even think you’re reading you’re posting. met woman said unvaccinated go hospital gets sick. She'll take herbs heal  pretty high Denmark. Although outlier high way. 76%. Canada instance. 
 
My impression (being Danish) Denmark attained relatively high vaccination rates general high trust government. trust maintained government attempted provide citizens high quality honest information, rather propaganda, emphasized voluntary rather force. trust government taken hit Corona period though, due seen heavy handed government restrictions. 
 
So Danish experience generalized (which course given all), 1) emphasize honest good quality information. try lecture use propaganda filter information politics ideology, censure perceived false information (my belief crack lab origin theory done lot damage trust media public institutions. personally certainly lost almost trust US media institutions); 2) try force coerce people. results pushback undermines trust. clog hospitals causing procedures people seeking treatment defer treatment

The fda actually put people vaccinated shouldn’t use antibody test measure immunity previous infection. system flushes antibodies fast, cells create antibodies live bone marrow responsible actual immunity recognize virus quickly flood system antibodies, kinda like firefighters knowing fire looks like turning hoses quickly need don’t.

Dude nut job sure. guess silver lining pro-vax. fucked version pro-vax, one nonetheless. Imagine, could stomach mandate vaccinated receive unemployment, WIC, food aid given eager restrict programs default? need deal reality situation. proven safe year now. time either accept modern science medicine find new career. Coddling providing incentives going anything. carrot already offered. time stick. Whether sky high premiums forced firings, really care. You’re missing point here. I’d bunch people far less protected future, that’s terrible time let COVID run rampant. Canada failed protect people fully vaccinated, US (and full vaccination likely three doses regular boosters).

On population level, math isn’t simple even assume you’ll facetank COVID outbreak. COVID death severe outcome risk highly homogenous, elderly 1000x+ risk death even within age group there’s multi-fold difference risk common comorbidities. Assuming large ongoing outbreak, even small population-level outbreak suppressive effect (small herd immunity threshold high) it’s unlikely single dose strategy reduces overall mortality targeted full-dose strategy course distribution.

Afterwords UK Canada got “lucky”, though course lucky relative ongoing enormous Delta outbreaks. coming say this... I’m surprised isn’t deputizing citizens sending dart rifles. Isn’t style? repeated predictions mass resignations failed happen, know thinks place different. Mostly sounds like either want bothered deal it, he's planning scapegoat mandate fails pay adequate money staff leave better-paying jobs. least consistent. We'll see holds longer breathe, least now. experts hear say necessarily reason. Here's virologist/immunologist pointing Moderna also longer delay shots. Sounds like sign get nobody ask questions anyway.

Honestly doses. might well get used. “And somebody starred shooting grocery store, I’d run right knock ‘em out!”

It’s always talk people, don’t courage make sacrifices they’re proud claim. staunch anti-vaxx coworker mine almost rage quit mandate went live (not healthcare, office job), realized daughter going college year, went got first shot. reason last resort people refused stay home quarantine voluntarily. kept going about. yes there's reason successful surpressing huge outbreak mad? known treatment kind subdermal laceration stuff crystals  putting reply later forget comment ask think immunity move around like normal person, unable daily hygiene routine without people helping, eat own, response like dont like, talk people talk him, always babbling random words, used throws tantrum many times young age attack us too, long time ago, taking care term providing food daily hygiene, dont really good motor skill. Ya wtf got similar side effects second shot, certainly worse. felt better day. decreased survival time might due combination factors, including critically ill patients clinicians chose place ECMO pandemic went on, treatments patients received started ECMO.

Click bait.  Pretty much guess opened article.  got better treating end worst worst put life support. I'm sorry loss. got first shot day mom died (I still shock, kept appointment) even begin tell symptoms besides sore arm, everything else goes grief: headache, dizziness, fatigue, muscle soreness, etc. sounds like real challenge. level functioning?  Likely popular opinion, need studies like this, need quality studies folks sides aisle. Right anti-vaxxers saying “see? Vaccines don’t work, could remove masks restrictions!” Fauci saying don’t get hopes Christmas (yes, know walked back, can’t unring bell). 

Effectiveness NEEDS message. Metrics need message. decouple cases hospitalizations, move away restrictions needs message.  argument doesn’t make sense. mandated federal level- employees leaving able go somewhere else. either leave medical profession accept it. worst aspect individuals scientific field, can’t understand science. Healthcare workers never tolerate abusing/threatening/violent behavior patients.

If someone psychotic, dementia, otherwise right mind, sedate use measures protect people working help them. someone mentally competent behaving like asshole, kick out.

Those two acceptable answers. patients acute psych aren’t allowed hit/bite/spit nurses, don’t tolerate COVID-19 patients either. They'll also likely live longer therefore cheaper, profitable long run rehire, retrain less sick days.   mentally challenged brother, family would like get covid vaccination. knowing dealing hospital consultation even doctor wanting check up, would react aggressive defensive. body quite big easy control. imagine get vaccinate, idea gonna be. I'm tired Dr. Fauci CDC changing stance frequently.

Does Dr. Fauci anything except go TV shows anymore? Seriously, guy loves go camera.  agreement, employees least one vaccine dose Oct. 15 allowed report work long receive second dose Nov. 15. Employees without record vaccination Oct. 15 separated Nov. 1. probably raise prices push demand making money.

People hosting large events, like weddings, using tests screen guests extra tests hand different brand guests test positive. confident result second test negative, Dr. Mina said. you’re worried you’ve exposed Covid, take two tests three four day period. Centers Disease Control Prevention says best testing window potential exposure test three five days high-risk event contact infected person. us never bend break easily shaken shallow intimidation men behind closed doors pretending powerful rulers rapid home tests work much like pregnancy test pink line indicating you’re positive coronavirus. tests require swizzle long swab nostrils.

Currently, rapid home antigen tests available United States include Abbott’s BinaxNOW, Quidel’s QuickVue, Australia’s Ellume recently authorized test Acon Labs, Flowflex. tests typically packaged two per box. 


 
A rapid home molecular test, Lucira, uses different technology similar test might get doctor’s office. it’s hard find, cost $50, isn’t practical option people. Considering 7 billion people world around 200 million recorded infections, makes around 2% chance catching covid. course fluctuates, tragically people think. example, state New York (which suffered initial wave, completely overrun), around 12% people got infected.

Which means find probability developing myocarditis covid (in worst case scenario) factor 12%, first *catch* covid. dissonance around conditional probabilities common logical fallacy, intuitive humans. feel like big question mark northern states happens colder weather come. Ohio still feels like late summer. haven’t even experienced sweatshirt weather yet. even need obese. BMI 25 barley overweight category like 70% country. Also verify anything anyone check box something get booster want. remember looking Heathrow arrivals website New York declared USA epicentre covid something like dozen flights hour coming in, masks, even temperature check definitely quarantine thinking “we fucked”. government, SAGE everybody involved absolutely fucked completely x evidence Asia border closures worked, quarantine temperature checks: none worked flawlessly put together contributed. live *a fucking island* easiest thing world implement this, *the science…*

The science flawed, modelling flawed learning others common sense. It’s horrible many killed much rest us affected completely incompetent response. many times week eating horse paste prevent COVID? 

This like saying ""why go dentist go 6 months?"" everywhere Michigan, maybe. We're still climbing, though thankfully appears slowly. study Declines cases may primarily driven factors waning.

My bet shadow immunity unvaccinated group almost wholly responsible drop effectiveness. Putin still hiding disinfected bunker?

Maybe need steal vaccine formulas west places restriction free long? think places like France Germany Covid pass type thing hospitality venues. There's also possibility countries under-counting, particularly case rates match excess deaths. Countries like Sweden also high population density UK does. We're squished country. 22 positive France?

God Texas work 2 weeks many antivaxxers Mathematician - herd immunity nothing. cases increasing exponentially, cutting spread mere 4% easily reduce cases, hospitalizations, deaths quarter. easily difference full hospital one space, even can't eliminate COVID. would hate outcome be: ""Don't get booster, keep masking stay away people."" think that's going happen. Assuming r0 7, 95% immunity covid??? Keep wearing maskssss like fool. Ah yes Texas Arctic  equity issue. was, release patents. describing business issue. I'm sick now. view unvaccinated third world dangerous American public lack boosters they’d justified pondering much equity impacts that. 

Justified pondering - perhaps. Justified banning boosters without coming firm conclusion case (and publishing calculations) - no, still fired. guess respect vaccinate, actively encourage everyone vaccinate, oppose mandate... know big shape venn diagram though.... like people oppose masks, unvaccinated, see sign business saying unvaccinated need mask actually put mask support business rights... exist.. take drag blow weed hetero Bros mouths kissy. always zero.

does make sick like 2nd shot us? completely commission 24 hours. hot button issue usually results either endless upvotes, endless downvotes. Probably depends whoever gets reply first.

Ultimately seems clear day, issue equity. ones willing completely front transparent this. FDA/CDC low key moved goalpost real quick discussing severe disease only. Pretending like original endpoint anyway. longer infection, longer transmission. quite ironic policies specifically based infection, ability unmask, later mask again. Personally find disingenuous. can't hold key eliminating (or greatly reducing) spread, withhold me, yet ask mask spread virus accidentally kill someone. Worst all, lack transparency regarding real reason. I'd rather come parrot WHO.

As far equity all, difficult parse this. US already committed donating 1 billion shots mid 22. AFAIK one **donated** nearly much. seen single credible source states withholding roughly 100 million boosters US would impact global vaccine equity. 1 shot withheld US equal 1 shot administered Africa. mention able produce 4 million shots day 6 months ago. imagine capacity point. we're probably talking several weeks capacity. administration says both. I've heard Scott G. discuss topic well, stating 1 less shot US equal 1 shot Africa, etc.

I sociologist, personally equity makes sense 1 1 scenario. prove shot withheld resulted someone developed world getting theirs, fine. can't, worse know work way, yet still insist equity optics... blood hands. Time switch different profession then. Exactly. social situations substance use presents probably people forget observe covid containment measures they're influence. know used lot really dumb things got baked friends college. “research” mean “read Facebook memes deny science”.

protection high-risk individuals short timeframe accompanying increase in 
reactogenicity. individuals lower risk COVID-19 occupational and/or health 
perspective, longer interval doses may provide additional benefit. booster 
administered 6 months dose 1 induced even greater immune responses observed 
with 2-month boost. correlate protection defined; higher responses could 
lead even longer lasting protection currently observed. Further, additional safety 
signals observed study COV3009 date combined data all 
the Ad26.COV2.S studies support safety regimen. summary, benefits booster 
whether given 2 months ≥6 months post-vaccination clear. data support schedule that 
provides benefit individuals based risks associated COVID-19, whether 
a single dose efficient pandemic response, 2-month boost individuals high risk of 
exposure specific health risks, ≥6-month boost maximize durable protection. 
Further, data date show accompanying increase risk adverse events. AMA run doctors restrict new openings keep demand job high. 13 months second third doses?

Jan. 9, 2020, week world first learned mysterious cluster pneumonia cases central China, authorities announced scientists found culprit: novel coronavirus. 
It sobering announcement, unnervingly familiar one. Nearly two decades earlier, different coronavirus hurdled species barrier sped around world, causing lethal new disease called severe acute respiratory syndrome, SARS. virus, became known SARS-CoV, killed 774 people health officials contained it. 
But even scientists worried history might repeating itself, one glimmer hope. Although viruses evolve, coronaviruses known relatively stable, changing slowly common flu. 
“There was, think, sense would work favor, nightmare scenario like influenza — constantly changing needing updated vaccines time — would probably case,” said Dr. Adam Lauring, virologist infectious disease physician University Michigan. 
What many scientists counted unchecked global spread. following weeks, new virus, SARS-CoV-2, skipped Wuhan, China, cruise ship Japan, small town northern Italy biotechnology conference Boston. Country country, global coronavirus trackers turned red. 
To date, 237 million people infected virus, 4.8 million died — 700,000 United States alone. 
With every infection come new opportunities virus mutate. Now, nearly two years pandemic, working way alphabet new viral variants: fast-spreading Alpha, immune-evading Beta, Gamma, Delta, Lambda and, recently, Mu. 
“We uncontrolled infections much world, that’s going lead chances virus evolve,” Dr. Lauring said. 
Even virus, evolution long game, relationship SARS-CoV-2 still infancy. extremely unlikely eradicate virus, scientists say, next years — decades — hold difficult predict. 
But legacy past epidemics, well basic biological principles, provides clues could headed. 
Past Pandemics Remind Us Covid Era, Crisis Fades 
History repeatedly demonstrates difficult decisively declare pandemic over.  one saying third shot hurt patient human (it’s considered safety risk). Moderna submitted data recommending boosters, done Phase 3 trials boosters humans *and is* giving third shots people benefits well understood (immunocompromised). authorities weighing potential benefits waste resources. Talk cheap. Forfeiting decent-wage job? cheap. get jab. don't, belong health care. Sometimes past months I've read people saying they're 'lockdown' 'quarantine' think ""wtf kind fantasy world live we're *still* lockdown?"" realize they're Australian helps, try imagine must like live Plague middle ages. scientific understanding truly happening, panic death building around you. would've understandable think end times, better times ahead.

But things impermanent, even pandemics, life moves on. looking silver linings COVID, think lot people re-evaluating lives what's important, many people deciding deserve life slaving away minimum wage paying slog. Also, Manhattan Project style effort make vaccines means things like mRNA tech much farther along could used many ailments accepted past. Interesting didn’t include states Michigan, Illinois, Kentucky worse vaccine rates Florida. think know why. 

Enhanced vaccine rates save lives every state. good news something hopefully get us back toward semblance normal life. concern view *substitute* getting vaccinated, instead supplementary treatment emergencies. I’m supporting people making choices put don’t put bodies Mine February, yeah, I’m sitting anxious here. Science. sentence key take-away looking means single sentence. 22k fewer deaths Florida Texas alone - covers end August - include September peak, looking forward.  Absolutely  fair, know that, either.

The paper correlates addiction breakthrough cases. may there's biological reason that, could social reasons discussed here. enough information say (you'd something like compare rates group smokes socially alone, example). 50/50 uses real bullets thought  think zoo older cat renal failure one point. say recovered.

Feeling vulnerable mean actually vulnerable.  already destined become something endemic we'd learn manage, emergence Delta basically forced decision.

Equity important US lot donate countries, giving boosters citizens hinder that. science says benefit offering boosters outweighs risk taking booster, done. likely sees another way control citizens. Unvaccinated people almost three times likely pour salt eyes Dovahkiin! day come, question when. Last year peak late December. see real reason last long last year. High numbers since early July. ""If individual actually negative covid I’d feel safe one mask""

This whole thread risk inconsistent false-negative PCR tests. Given sick assistant (in OPs words), OP right worry Covid spite negative test.

OP also said tiny room together. Someone infected Delta variant fill small room Aerosols within mere minutes. 

Given two factors, suggested N-95 mask would far safe scenario simpler masks. understanding you’d need prove damages would hard. Even caught covid couldn’t prove caught them. Tylenol. got COVID couple weeks ago. Got J &amp; J vaccine April still contracted outdoor concert.

While studies done UK regularly mix-and-match 2nd dose. think started mixing recently 3rd dose. use J&amp;J, though.

“For comparison, COVID-19 cases children 5-17 13 districts imposed forced-masking schools decreased 77%, average. 
“POSITIVITY RATES: 
 
“The 54 districts opt-outs mask policy seen average decrease 65% positivity week ending Aug. 19 (when school started) week ending Sep. 30.

The basic idea mask effective prevending covid started questioned read almost equal rise decline covid cases USA counties states mask required non required.

The basic hypiothesis efficacy mask preventint covid spread could falsified (in regarding Popper science theory) single fact observation. case, observed mask quite useless reducing Covid spread. 

I admit puzzled it.

Yes definitely much anxiety. metabolic disorder hell, severe feeling constant hunger, ate still felt hungry, time much appetite. lasted 2 weeks, constantly day night. thought going crazy. horrible point would actually story day would all-time high. Germany recommends mRNA anyone got JJ. 4 weeks(!). Reason delta.  That’s less dentist charges missing appointment (or cancelling 24 hours notice). Pfizer? Currently six months pregnant weighing “when”. Got second moderna shot end April, trying decide it’s better get booster immediately, wait third trimester I’ve got stronger protection hospital babe hopefully antibodies first weeks. Anyone anything suggest either way? I'd willing bet good deal anti-vax / anti-mask nonsense came directly Russian disinformation campaigns.

I'm surprised current turn events. Fantastic news, 2nd dose May really loves hearing that.  look trend lines 6 months can't even see dip deaths. 1500 deaths day insane still even trends 1000 deaths day 2 months that's still throw covid party level. 

It's likely going shoot back Jan lagging behind Christmas thanksgiving.  That's speculation - viruses work.  spread people get together travel.   shit. Johnson’s response bewilderingly appallingly bad. Thank explanation. I’ll field one:

No, they're nearly everyone.

-65+ long term care residents get booster

-50-64 underlying health conditions get booster

-18-49 underlying health conditions MAY get booster, based individual risk assessment (no doctor's note needed)

-18-64 high occupational exposure risk MAY get booster.

""Underlying health conditions"" includes 74% adult population based BMI alone (since overweight BMI, obese), goes include high blood pressure, current/former smoker, substance use, diabetes, asthma, among others.

People risk due job includes healthcare workers, teachers, first responders, grocery store workers... anyone working public close quarters many others. Also institutional settings, e.g. prisoners.

So damn near everyone qualify one way another.  heck snow leopard South Dakota? Man pilots flying politicized. 

So majority pilots anti vax 1/3 them? it. live county 82% vaccination rate 18+ demographic. got booster 2 weeks ago, spouse didn't, pretty sick, tested positive yesterday. fully vaxxed mid March. ""mild"" like cold, ""mild"" like flu. sure people get sick, can't imagine would like us sick time. hoping booster holds up! Yeah, corporations already wanted (can’t think single one spoke federal mandate), probably prepared backlash en masse resignations workers heading competitors. Leaning federal government helps ensure kind scenario won’t happen. unfortunately also includes booster doses. see 1st dose breakdown trend here, shows 1st dose demand decline =( Interesting, thank info! I’ve turned 30 mildly concerned myocarditis.  last winter (at least me) lot mitigations happening people traveling much, family canceled holiday get togethers Thanksgiving Christmas, friends incredibly shitty Zoom NYE get together. Much last winter city, indoor dining closed indoor public spaces shit-ton Covid last winter, hardly flu (I even get cold). year none case, thing people still wearing masks indoors, sort of, everything else fully open, lends increased spread communicable diseases like flu.  Canada, accepted fact mix matching mRNA covid vaccines safe effective. Millions Canadians recived mixed vaccines AstraZeneca, Moderna, Pfizer. I'd wager Pfizer-Pfizer-Moderna effective 3x Pfizer waiting settled beyond doubt. Moderna effective solely 3.3x higher dose. also means side effects: 5x chance myocarditis recent study, instance. Moderna's trialing half-dose booster, much closer pfizer's dosage.

Aside higher side effects, there's safety issue. people 30 (where myocarditis side effect starts coming play) definitely need larger dosage first place.  one's rooting it, posts like Exhibit exactly going happen.  That's did, Pfizer original series, Moderna booster. I'm teenager worried myocarditis (and one either, that's me). 

Maybe there's additional benefit, I'm 'bet health it' sure *less* benefit. 

Just glad officially authorize them, half dose boosters becomes official taking away major draw Moderna vaccine. Even original series stronger, might better booster wanted profiteer instead better product (and yes, since never tested anything 50ug, I'm assuming profiteering).  I'll make sure pop post ""I told so"" cases deaths shoot December. Again. can't stop putting hands hot stove. Hydration, electrolytes, exercise game changers POTS.

Dealing something like COVID takes concentrated effort levels 2020, UK failed every single way, much obvious.  found 11% reduction cases surgical masks worn community

This really fair summary. study measuring efficacy *mask intervention program* encouraged mask usage, mask wearing observers found 13% people villages received interventions wore mask properly, compared 42% people villages household received free masks in-person reminders wear them. 

A better summary would ""increasing percentage people wearing masks correctly 13% 42% appeared reduce symptomatic cases around 11%"". 

How many cases would prevented 80% 90% people wearing masks correctly? spectulate. state Department Health doesn’t know many calls made contact tracers doesn’t keep track them, department spokesman Alberto Moscoso said. What’s more, Florida portion job contact tracing it’s described guidelines CDC.

Did take Covid vax? so, concerned vax status others? risks. They're small, risks also weighed small benefits (based value judgements FDA chooses use) booster. There's reason multiple countries already recommending Moderna certain demographics. 

Getting booster ""just bad"" antivaxers take HCQ Ivermectin, ""HCQ used decades perfectly safe, take case?"" one primary argument taking HCQ. 

But already multiple studies showing effects boosters Pfizer Moderna. Granted, real-world data Moderna limited FDA probably want use data mRNA booster (which think reasonable; prefer FDA high standard evidence). bigger problem FDA made personal value judgement many real benefits matter (preventing mild covid, losing 2+ weeks pay, long covid, transmitting disease others, etc). people different things value must data based personal values. graph year looks much like one last year me, bigger. see much optimism holiday season, think we're nightmare coming up. even discussion ?

I not.

Some people seem see urgency --- many families people immune compromised, elderly diabetes risk factors. many cases, 12s unvaccinated people household. 

The complications interminably long review process quite serious parents young children.
