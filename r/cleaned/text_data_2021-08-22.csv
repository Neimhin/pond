World War 1? Obviously COVID worse, analogous type risk, much worse people unwilling accept order return things enjoy doing. can't believe we're far pandemic people still think Plague Inc. jokes original Sorry, may clear. working 70% NSW, late October / early November. Sadly, true teachers professors too. company pays $28M per year rent office space New York.

You’d think they’d wanna save money let us go remote Skype people work anyways.


Hahahaha. team split across two countries 3 time zones. Never ever team meeting one zoom. already working different locations, matter whether locations exactly three offices numerous homes 3 zones? 

I mean would like meet local office mates team lunches, etc. point going back full work office...  response vaccines show side effects within weeks.

The second response know nothing almost long term side effects Covid though know exist. vaccine help. Would political system answer? workers communist system go work, shit get made, food harvested people would f*cked. Capitalism probably helped more, given gave birth tech allows people work home. company ONE accountant dark Puerto Rican gentleman. ALMOST work alone. never complained, COVID hit, profits almost tripled, accounting workload increased SIGNIFICANTLY.


He tried asking $30k raise. salary? $100k. said no.

He asked hire additional accountants maybe give 5 support staff manage increased workload. also said no.


They said no!!! 

He quit. replaced one white lady. quit second week due assessing situation realizing she’s fucked stays. haven’t able get anyone else even apply position. resume inbox dry abandoned. We’ve posted everywhere.


They’re struggling find applicants right they’re already starting miss payments clients failing invoice bill properly…. Payroll BARELY got done, SHIT SHOW.


They go crawling back guy fat consulting contract, $270k pay going give discretion hire staff help work. 



They given $30k raise…. idea behind passports reduce spread, 100% prevent it. Delta, going see constant flare ups actually intend reopen country rest World. There's reason NZ's health minister expressed doubts current COVID zero plan relied strict border controls backed hard lockdowns cases slip through, Hipkins said Delta may force like nothing we've dealt pandemic,"" change everything, means existing preparations begin look less adequate raises pretty big questions future long-term plans."" Killing host desirable virus. dead host leaves virus unable replicate spread hosts. strain would quickly die lower ability spread.
That's probably saved us SARS first place. There's tracker places NSW mid November 80% though. Vaccine rollout speeding October date must extrapolating speedup, fully vaccinated? Without liberal telework policy, company cannot also claim support diversity, equity, inclusion. latter depends former. Remember people sub freak deny profusely concern raised two months back? Yeah vaccines making yall immune let party like nothing shave week now. change razor month days. vaccines stop people getting sick virus. boost immunity level get sick, body able handle it. Essentially vaccines prevent long term severe illness, preventing lomg-covid need go hospital.

For people previous covid infections, vaccines proven effective previous exposure builds immunity memory vaccine, even first jab acts booster. People categories shown much higher anti-bodies vaccine along.

&amp;#x200B;

In UK, combined mass amount vaccinations previous exposures, adult population 90% people anti-bodies.

&amp;#x200B;

Virus get deadly, opposite true. example one deadly virus kills host instantly, less time spread someone else. always less deadly viruses dominate world-wide re-infect population kill people, like common cold. exposed nuisance life-threating.

&amp;#x200B;

It Spanish flu, never actually went away. evolved less deadly strain time people built immunity it. process took three 3 years 50 million dead.

&amp;#x200B;

However mass vaccinations process rapidly accelerated. true - definately something, getting reff one settings last year got Pfizer helped. I’ll save AZ third dose day future hopefully. Yup. going selling point lot businesses now. Don’t offer competitors do? Good luck finding workers exactly ""worrying bosses""? bosses perhaps incapable managing staff unless stand shoulders every minute day? unwilling adapt times? Either way, bosses grow up, learn manage staff business properly. 
Of course talking businesses hands-on workers essential, office jobs done 100% remotely. doubt century. human population continues grow past sustainable levels populations centres become even denser providing perfect opportunities future viruses rapidly spread. developing countries push wildlife populations risk new viruses jump humans. continuation factory farming less perfect safety measures allow viral breeding grounds opportunities jump workers. saw middle Covid workers Russian poultry farm catching avian flu, thankfully person person transmission. People ability modify viruses countless ways. Covid shown powerful viruses county even modern medicine. think overly optimistic assume country organization consider trying harness power weaponize it. vaccinated 1% population single day last Friday! thing every single disease exists: get vaccinated, accept sometimes people die live it. live knowing heart disease, cancer flu exist kill many many people year? yeah one. serious case schadenfrede Victorian watching NSW burn, now…. much. VIC numbers last four days look bit like head Delta pass. working outdoors labor job way pandemic. try resist rolling eyes people complaining don’t want leave house return air conditioned clean office. even demanding employer pay home utility bills. take job, please? I’ll go office, sure hell beats strenuous activity pouring rain wearing 5 layers access toilet 90% day. say thing negative reaction vaccine? Saying either 0 100% bad math bad risk management. guys killing it! Keep hard work putting in. well indian variant then, ultra transmissible one soon called delta.

It also variant mostly responsible infecting people hotel quarantine way out.

The point , didnt lock (WA QLD certainly would have) didnt spread. mean probably messed response badly Gladys... choice now, need euthanize every citizen stop case count growing. Good bye NZ.  Man virus must fun. min-maxing way end human life. trying create vaccine drug fight it. like game. yes, example could get endosomal escape mutants could take covid antibodies infection/replication macrophages.

dengue one virus this, fact someone reported 2014 coronavirus could also exactly K. *still* nothing protecting kids.

(Waiting clinical trial results approving vaccinations children, hand, specifically meant protect kids.)

If like mask mandates venue limitations, take local officials. vaxxed, safe gonna get. Time open let thing burn out. Lock one leave home purpose food delivered home via military. way stop spread. Texas, winter storms, cousin's power stayed (probably close lives hospital.) (60, obese, active, health issues) let son (37) DIL DIL's parents (80-something) stay survive storm. Granny-in-law covid gave cousin. Granny never symptom. cousin died April 4th month vent. People need stop trying predict chances based anecdotes (including mine lol). fuck people think NZ humble? Oh want admit listening science making policy decisions based health outcomes politics works. Muddle another year two years. We'll get exposed, vaccinated likely get sick significantly lower chance hospitalized. vaccinated...
At point we'll sort immunity, vaccination, infection combination both. virus stay around acquired immunity mean severity lessen extent different getting cold.

It really sucks, do. Wait. Today learned medical worker mean idiot.  is!! still productive good economy! Alternatively: I've let c19 get totally control state expect government prevent disease death. 

And states okay control disease blame me.

But vaccination program fix up. vaccination program slow. thing different people different capacities breath mask. like know how. trouble periodically would bring mask down, take breath put back on. also harder breath congested well. record, NZ supermarkets following:

* Limit many people inside once
* lines people outside, one person per 2m apart

Maybe I'm coming gen Z mindset, leading team high school easy. text everyone groupchat, send updates every hour, turn facetime need detail. know technology finnicky really see can't things lot phone calls. Yeah pretty common occurrence. I'm big guy worked grocery store get university. least week jackass (usually woman) would grab arm thought something wrong. backed pretty quickly smaller female coworkers struggle get away. Don’t fire 10 year olds! seems section US enGulfed COVID 😁 school nurse. would take temp make sure weren’t faking called parents. Sounds similar us Australia - vaccine hesitancy definitely exists media beat AZ. missus absolutely refuses take I'm scheduled 2nd shot couple days. Pfizer shot scheduled end Oct.

We're entering hardest lockdown coming weekend whole pandemic Sydney, presumably reach sufficient vaccinated numbers.

Wasn't govt benevolent delaying distributing vax, incompetent. History paved bodies double-edge sword wounds. source reference: highlights: 

...archived samples 7389 routine blood donations collected American Red Cross 13 December 2019 17 January 2020 donors resident 9 states (California, Connecticut, Iowa, Massachusetts, Michigan, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington, Wisconsin)...

...Donations reactivity occurred 9 states.

&amp;#x200B;

it's US prior 2019 Jan, community spread states researchers looked prior 2019 Jan.

it's striking look COVID spread Chinese provinces outside Wuhan/Hubei, comparison, China looks much like earlier spreading phase time. think locked much longer October - November. federal governments rhetoric changed recently say open achieve 70 - 80% full vaccination regardless commumity transmission (we track late Oct. NSW rest states weeks behind). 

Still 8 weeks away though glue, livestock dewormer. Infections happen virus reproduces faster immune system fight it, regard, mutations make virus reproduce faster bad news. vaccines still protective, effectiveness likely drop virus grows quickly. even reason bosses work getting done? thought 4 day work week still 8 hours day. hours crammed there. see videos full ER waiting rooms, title isn’t tiniest misleading. NZ AU borders closed shut since march 2020. Strict rules allowed 14 days quarantine hotel facilities, test negative several times let society. 

We also strict restrictions movement, mask wearing allowed go see who. 

Currently allowed buy necessities (groceries medicin), excersise 1h, get vaccinated care someone cannot care themselves, within 5km home. cannot go friend's house. Restaurants open take away. Clothing stores closed. DIY stores click collect only. 

Thanks this, AU still less 1000 deaths covid sine start outbreak. estimated almost 100k lives saved restrictions, especially rural areas people live 1000km closest hospital capable treat serious covid case. you’re hospital COVID, isn’t really decision left make. kinda known already?  Weird case, hand they're claiming mass events safe What's badmouthing Israel posts? Also what's link zero new Israeli treatments.

Israel one world's leaders biomedical research forerunner fight Covid.. Something see coming Iran, Jordon, Lebanon, Syria, Saudis, etc. Ah, link says:
 China reported 21 new confirmed cases, imported cases 
 
Whereas person said: 
 What? recorded ZERO local transmissions. 
 
So difference local vs imported. 
 
I agree complacent people still affected. Getting vaccine like wearing bullet proof vest. still get hurt die, much better wearing anything. Thank :) Vietnam nearly 1500 daily cases Ho Chi Minh locked down. NZ locked six hours first case found. hope speed difference. Everyone knows Delta extremely hard get ahead of.

So far every case found infected prior lockdown starting. that's still mostly true 3-4 days' time might OK. spike protein bind another receptor Grab you?? ""You can't fix stupid"" - Ron White literally described different measures NZ government taking response delta variant. what's SPR? know even want bring people back offices. Would cheaper everyone telework since paying rent building? Yes, think ""living it"" ultimately means living inconvenience. people cooperate won't. Jurisdictions people cooperate ultimately gain economic quality life advantages can't manage this. mind, perhaps considerable pressure put bad actors deserve, would general interest. Zero covid realistic planet Earth. planet humans, different countries different governments different cultures.

""Breakthrough cases rare"" yeah, ignore UK Isreali data put vaccine effectiveness preventing infection (not symptomatic infection hospitalization) anywhere 40 60%.

You could’ve easily said “Even though support BLM, support cause behind May protests, protesting pandemic peak still bad idea”.

But, noooooo, try defend one pandemic protest bash another pandemic protest, like one dislike other. one funniest things I’ve seen subreddit, honestly.

Good job ignoring main point: developing better vaccine already distributing impossible COVID hits every person free supply N95 masks? beyond manufacturing distribution technology, beyond financial means? gives that?

Yes is. Even used new one every month (you're supposed use one day) enough 7 billion people what? 2 years? 3? long people going wear them? can't even get people wear cloth mask many cases.

I’m sorry many died strongly believe better governance worst could avoided, something like going get corporate america “you’re working see ass chair.” I’m never going back office avoid it. haven’t even gotten sick last two years (except covid early pandemic - RIP sense smell taste).  compared others. 20% fully 35% single dose total population. delayed purchasing bulk countries need got in. target vaccinating everyone wants vaccinated nov / dec. Stop spreading misinformation. Alpha. Please enlighten me: point going back office ? good news wrong then, also wrong now.

The good numbers June USA Delta made significant impact yet, effects Delta could, indeed predicted based happened India/UK/etc.

Nothing happened Delta reached 50% Covid cases surprise. could set watch it.

""But thought said 'good news'?""

Yes, similar plenty evidence impact Delta happened, there's precisely zero evidence everything going get worse forever.

TL;DR - people disappointed (both optimists feeling genuinely disappointed, bad-faith actors scaremongering) one thing common, unstated expectation conclusion zero Covid cases achievable. isn't.

Continual Covid outbreaks ever lower fatality rates (because: vaccines, treatment, prior immunity, etc.) conclusion pandemic.   think key difference Melbourne leaky border NSW, potentially seeding new clusters regularly. Poor Victoria sabotaged giant outbreak next door. Sydney simple matter failing ever adequately lockdown, even present moment. 

In terms testing, tested 7% population Auckland last 6 days. total 108,000 tests Auckland 99 positives city none unlinked. also wastewater testing showing unexpected spread. People understanding all. It’s frustrating. Kids filling hospitals sick right now. it’s like summer, what’s gonna happen winter?

Not mention pediatrics specialty. things keep getting bad, staffing stretched . Treating little kids treating adult. lockdown baby I'm glad get spend every day home instead missing office don’t like it’s harder micromanage people. I'm going hazard guess matter time starts spreading states. already see uptick Victoria. NSW outbreak also quite yet control, chance.

I hope proven wrong though. went vegas november 2019 got pneumonia that. rare someone young healthy like get pneumonia. def 2019 spike started June 8, peaked around July 19. started July 9, went slower, probably owing much higher vaxx rates, slows spread.

I'd say likelihood gonna peaking anytime soon. Possibly contagious definitely less virulent, therefore less concern. former employer us come back 2 days week. stuck month interviewing time. able find full remote position, better benefits, big increase compensation. Keep options open open recruiters reaching you. Update resumes LinkedIn profile/preferences. Gooooood. r/holup  Alternate title: ""Corporate America Angry Workers Acting Like Office Furniture."" would interested study Finland, anyone link paper. Right I'm convinced otherwise methodology simply establishing people breathing viable viral particles regardless vaccination status bearing ability infect others.  So, mean Liberals plan own? (Seeing plan last week turned identical Conservative platform, anyway?) addition load dropping faster vaccinated individuals, vaccinated people less likely get infected first place. infection, viral replication, mutations. Bosses reject flexibility worried employees won’t back - also behind times new world.  expecting?? cites numbers recent (aka Delta specific?). I’m curious see what’s going come w recent spread U.S. Work voluntold us back July. They'll never let us go back wfh. sad jc. prevent getting video news stations without waiver first. vaccine better vaccine. know people similar position got Sinovac first dose later waited got Moderna second. Blood donations? NZ? tell you’re base comment lol. Cos numbers going due people locations interest lockdown includes schools, hospital, public transport, malls, grocery shops, events, etc.). contacted get test identified close contacts. still going ofc that’s cases continue go up. think lot depends job. I'm software developer, used lose much time people stopping chat I'm struggling maintain mental model something.

What day interruptions co-workers (no chat messages, calls, meetings), lot before?

I think attending meetings since people can't ask questions around office still get many direct messages people stopping desk. Maybe since easy throw text. think heard recent estimate (not necessarily best estimate; I'm qualified make judgement) 6-7. would mean 85% people need immunity. vaccines even give 85% immunity, even 100% people get vaccinated, masks and/or social distancing still required handle outbreaks like dealing now. Maybe booster shots gen 2 vaccines push immunity closer 85% least prevent serious outcomes enough live virus widespread, works near 100% vaccination still leaves immunocompromised people die. 

&amp;#x200B;

Herd immunity achievable, vaccines alone. R0 values assumptions human behaviors, changed. [Because 2008 never Inferior based multiple efficacy studies  Thankfully, O'Toole &amp; Kenney seem (so far!) vastly different leaders. Funny, Zoom meetings involve screen sharing. makes less awkward, focusing document/info instead staring one another. feels like real meetings instead audio/video ones screen shared. people vaccinated getting infected delta, people previously infected vanilla covid also getting reinfected. interesting thought provoking! Increase testing batch testing increase restrictions grocery stores. others mentioned it’s probably bit late, delta can’t let guard down. Capitalism answer virus. 

It was, get work die. perspective. live Sweden moment schools high school open whole pandemic. appears right thing do. 

Rationale younger children seem much less affected COVID-19, also nurses doctors work home taking care children. really kinda crazy think apply jobs comparatively tiny radius around live spend hours everyday driving pick entire life go live somewhere else. huge downwards driver wealth inequality, quality life global productivity is. People infected level immunity too. immunity conferred vaccinations plus immunity conferred infections makes virus harder spread less deadly almost every person's immune system familiar it, endemic like flu. It'll still kill people weakened immune systems, cause massive waves people get infected fill hospitals. 

Keep mind goal early pandemic eradicate virus, lower rate infection spreading prevent excessive strain medical resources. Right still enough people immunity hospitals still overwhelmed new waves patients, can't last forever. really would go faster everyone would get vaccinated though, vaccine immunity supposedly lasts longer direct virus exposure immunity.  keep hearing stuff like that, keep peaking. it’s level 4 lockdown. drive through. take outs. click collect. deliveries.  Where's Kurt Russell flame thrower need him? speak volumes hard, impossible without full lockdown spanning weeks, squash even small Delta outbreak. Even ~75% fully vaccinated, Singapore's still seeing double digit cases. think countries previously pursuing COVID zero strategy starting realize impossible Delta. prediction model. point reliable indicator might happen avoid scenario thoughtful policy. take outs? Why? 1 year enough clearly said, whatever things ""collapse"" work offices never go away. Even like them, people do. companies may abandon many new companies ride ""no office"" train, couple years full time remotework boring norm new fancy offices attracting people. Bosses want back office watch you. we're worried Orwellianism prediction future. model assumes new measures implemented control spread. point reliable indicator might happen avoid scenario. 80% team loved working home. 20% (the oldest group) want go back office soon possible want many people back possible. 

I 0 desire return office. productive, breaks even end working hours average. I’m sorry human being. hope everything’s going ok. Working home life never even dreamed of. stay fridge pantry… Yeah wondering vaccination timeline most. people know gotten breakthrough infection people got shots first. idea actually thing. seems worth looking into. 8 months vaccination. I'm 4 months out. make difference? hope find out. really accept need to. Indonesia looked horrible, one day cases dropped. follow pattern, peaking pretty soon. coworker got sick trip Hong Kong Thanksgiving 2019 later tested positive COVID antibodies (not spike protein one vaccination) US late November least. Luckily stayed home soon got back since became sick trip appear spread anyone knows of. lol. OLD news Okay someone US literally see single person spouse plumber basement flood... serious NZ need take they're complete shut except food supplies?

Lambs blood door? happen know developing on? mean prototyping something like arduinos sure shelf components, actually delivering custom hardware way beneficial developers close testing units easily debug testers.

Otherwise going behind hw revs visit office anyway office mail new revs board constantly problem can't easily solved logs need slow tedious chats cameras.

I think said impossible (if did, mean it), way easier people location. Food essential. Going grocery stores whenever please not. don’t expect NZ implement strict policy like that, can’t say I’m surprised numbers going that. Heard Feakonomics podcast ""reverse brain drain"" IRS saw allowed full remote work. People moved DC back home towns. way, they'd giving we're going get boosters third world two shots, Pfizer Moderna would giving us Delta boosters. Actually way, would giving third world Delta vaccine shots well. 

I way though. available third doses original vaccine boosters. I'll get first moment allow to.

You guilt people wanting booster. control this. us fully vaccinated given opportunity get boosters happy get one feel bad getting it. people feel bad ones given opportunity vaccinated refuse. Please link do. totally bill hour, unless they're associates big firm make salary, still bill work hour, try pad hours much possible. 

No don't. used write time young associate and/or partners right time think took long. funny though confidently willing act like poster wrong though, lol. Really?  I’m going here. think world eventually get vaccinated? worrying bosses? must something positive employees...  total hospital admissions, 45% fully vaccinated, 52% among people fully chief executive Paul Reid said: ""The vaccination status ICU, 62% ICU cases currently hospital vaccinated partially vaccinated, remaining 20 23% fully vaccinated. I’ve office since 6/1. Everyone vaccinated though working office. Sounds like anxiety me, pandemics cause that. Lamda ""I got next!"" mean, even lab tests, I'd accepting point delta fit alpha. 

If look genetic sequencing, looks pretty clear many countries AY.4 AY.12 advantage traditional Delta.  Yea ok, hear out. Offices suck work in. really make much difference since isolated anyway amount work ends involved. gonna CRAZY how, opposing party retakes governorship, powers restored.

WEIRD. get mean. I've fully vaccinated. zero interest getting COVID, whether symptomatic asymptomatic. want long COVID, want permanent heart, lung, brain damage.

What, exactly, problem that? spending ""85%"" time suffing web office would spend time work home? kind logic this?

But take it. argument actually matter little work office. point probably even less home. feel productive. (and might even be, get work done hour used take four, goof rest day actually productive employer's point view)  That's entities money work.  old government corporate never acknowledge time moved forward 1975.

See: IRS still COBOL taxes. Racist One thing United States excels high tech expensive, medicine. would add though social element you’re missing remote pronounced new hires. It’s difficult integrate new team without meeting people person getting know outside slack channel  kiwis vaccinated. Sadly vaccine program slow, still vaxxed eligible soon. We've approved 12-16 year olds. Long term decisions cant made vaccination program completed.  children, much extra time get spend breakfast, able pick school reasonable hour after-school care. awesome. Worth pointing Florida one best states suited limit covid spread weather standpoint. Low latitude high solar radiation year, warmer temperatures higher humidity reduces spread. caveat summer drives people indoors there, overall better situated places. They've blown many  Thanks Probably best thing come pandemic  can’t work home. god jealous. leave hour early work every day takes hour back. 8 hour day became 10 hours. huge accident freeway today complete stop extra hour. Working home sounds like blessing, even tho can’t, hope people could, get opportunity. Especially don’t need office. Still end game. End game every single adult annnd kid get vaccinated world. reality going happen. mask vaccinated not. Even zero cases took contact tracing seriously. still chance. Personally, think far gone countries. chance lockdown 2 weeks case 0, well year. Social media far removed real life current situation highlights immensely wish could muster kind optimism even moment. Sounds like it; yeesh. Delta might somewhat worse, real problem R 6 compared original strain around 3, shorter cycle time. two weeks, unmitigated Delta infect close 100 times people original. Even bad, Delta sends people hospital instead spread many weeks. doubling R also exponential growth. obvious environmental benefit reduced emissions millions commuting vehicles. Yeah takes one old man say that's business done everyone's fucked again. already happened me. That's Reddit topic. People abuse downvotes things like disagree without actual discussion. HistoryLink October 29, 1918, six-ply gauze masks became mandatory Seattle. next day required throughout state. public health discipline fell apart Armistice announced November 11, 1918. Thousands joyous people celebrated Seattle's streets, ""not mask sight."" mask rule lifted next day theaters public places reopened. Illness deaths climbed peaked December 9, 1918, dropping off. Schools reopened January 1919 March 1919 deaths influenza reported. Seattle suffered death rate disease approximately half San Francisco third Philadelphia Baltimore.

It would interesting know mandates would communicated -- local newspapers? Telegrams? Flyers?

Also, 99% Invisible interesting masks became popular Asia. attribute Chinese experience 1910 Manchurian Plague massive public health campaigns related disease outbreaks. mention mandatory rapid testing place mandatory vaccines... I'm sure people want keep indefinently vax sooner tha later. get ""managers needed"" people talk everything going WFH. still mentor, evaluate delegate. much harder guy 50 people need people teams 5 10. here. I'm glad say though, actually fully remote, permanently.

About 70%/30% Yes that’s exactly managers worried, cases they’re lot hands working remotely, productivity gone up. Meaning value questioned. I'm opposite, need get damn house chores. hybrid schedule ideal personally, prefer face face interaction.

My problem matter what, current market I'm going people 8-10 years experience entry level, associate positions. stay freelancer. Beta Alpha thing infected one, reduced protection one, think one way, remember which. VacCiNeS SaFe EfECTive big jump mortality even possible? You’re right. July cold. August hot. fully aware delusional many idiots like use excuse it. say could happen pointed done would collectively space in. illusion would happen tragedy commons always rules iron fist. state NZ somehow wrong solution plain dumb, data science shows stop spread virus opportunity mutate...no delta lambda...as run letters virus finished. know much deeper conversation market. societal shift. Lakh = 100K

So million. Interesting approach get votes 7 day average reported deaths currently 24.6/day. delay 2-3 weeks death reporting tho. reporting consistent all. 

The last 10 days looked like this:

- 8/13 - 27
- 8/14 - 2
- 8/15 - 0 
- 8/16 - 3
- 8/17 - 37
- 8/18 - 4
- 8/19 - 53
- 8/20 - 36
- 8/21 - 36
- 8/22 - 3 ask, concern? studies show people productive home anyway? literal difference make long work getting done?

Are lonely? appearance? Link avoid paywall. Well, type work commutes hand's-on. I'm 65hrs week, heh. Rest team, same. people stay put clients suppliers. Lending facts EXACT topic post dumb? Yikes. Cool bro I’m minority misses workspace. would love hybrid schedule. sorry hear that, hope better now. brother 2 nephews covid last year far good, seem long term issues still makes nervous super vigilant even I'm fully vaccinated. fine. Reasonable public health precautions like vaccination almost certainly correct, legally morally, slippery slopes start something legally morally correct. Tell coworking spaces. It’s hard get budget it. Especially companies ditched office lease. going make much difference. fail see business shitter. I’m sure they’ll happy blame employees, go under. good vaccine get keep hearing weird things one idk it’s bullshit need informing booster recommendations. Let's get 2 shots people, still number priority along boosters 50 haha youre right, need concentrating  us suffering, even draconian self-imposed lockdowns. know labeling victim; certainly feel way. throw around term ""PTSD"" casually.

It's thrown around casually, I'm serious. ""draconian self-imposed lockdown"" also self-admittedly comfortable endure *forever* obviously extreme reaction traumatic event. Avoiding behaviors may enjoyed previously definitely considered maladaptive coping mechnism (among many others see consistent basis). Anyways, I'm diagnosing you. I'm making simple observation based I've seen online society What's ""disturbing"" it? think pointless circle-jerk worrying? 

I think pointless circle-jerking. would honestly insult call that. Still, reminds behaviors engaged suffering absolute worse OCD/GAD - definitely triggered let people affect ""disturb"" you?

Empathy. 

Good luck, last message, try best avoid reddit debates - consider poor coping mechanism well (JK.. sorta).

P.S. way *are* victim. are. No, agree lot aspects mentioned. I'm glad WFH works lot people, me. said, especially last one hits little close home. computer use use whatever wanted like movies, games, etc. hybrid work computer. Unfortunately luxury space specific room home office interconnected. I'm managing lot better now, awaiting time go back office sever work/home connection interact coworkers camaraderie since actually like coworkers. I'm partial believe opposition. Considering Ayatollah banned US British Vaccines week ago. thinking day makeup products going date long since I've felt need wear regularly! I'm gonna fork whole new load go back office. Ugh Weed em Depends company culture. workaholic shop culture boss constantly checking progress looking shoulder see you’re working. Remote basically didn’t anything lol That's point Batman pointy ears? what's peak deaths January check back 3 weeks.

Three weeks tomorrow. Deaths 1000 day average NYT's tracker. 1007 / 3352 (absolute peak!) = 30%.

We've already blown prediction deaths continuing climb, cases/hospitalizations still climbing plateaued.

I would sadly predict deaths continue climb ~2-3 weeks behind cases, cases gone 40% since two weeks ago, much less 3 weeks ago. possible deaths continue rise 1400 day average, even increases cases, still increasing.

Again, see happens. think deaths match previous peak, we're definitely going 45% peak, 15-25%. always check back 3 weeks still disagree. you’re describing called “unforced error” competition absolutely scoop talent steal market share. I’m watching happen right now. evaluate source look opinions. can’t take everything face value lot sources…foxnews, cnn, Washington post, etc angle. Look truths also question motivation story. 

You know works…they wrote narrative. Engineering consultants too, put LOT business development/overhead clients want pay lot things. usually bill 60% time, remaining 40% goes company. Louder!!!! Yeah WSJ article linked onto LinkedIn feed today gen Z wanting return office commonality boomers subject. I’m member gen Z (I’m millennial), highly question that. Manager here, I'm happy hard chargers working home, scrubs really struggled work home. (Like put PIP struggle). Large enough contain virus. like said, 0.3 microns point worst filtering, particle size used determine efficiency. N95s 95% efficient 0.3 microns better larger smaller particles. bad, may misread.

It let read though. You’re making data. guess want go, make plan go. Assuming herd immunity makes sense me, decide yourself. Me, I’m flexible given it’s pandemic largely control. don’t get overly disappointed change plans. 

There absolutely indication Florida better next summer. Religious exemptions based sincerely held personal beliefs, government's interpretation religious organization's doctrine. government can't interpret religion's teachings force religious person adhere them, irreligious person. religions would probably class vaccines adiaphora anyway, they'd defer individual's beliefs matter personal faith.

(""Sincerely"" probably key word, hard prove disprove.) Yet over-50, morbidly obese coworker thinks vaccine would risky choice. wrong, bitch compare different countries data everyone seems want measure way. find graphs showed looked like near parity US Sweden well. graph though shows thinking big rush US early universal access vaccines, EU struggles get supplies. big slump US vaccine hesitant antivax people choose go, even though supplies high. 

Whereas Scandinavia, everyone snatching every dose soon get hands it, leveling near 80% eligible recipients - limited approval young people yet. 

Also interesting delta fear/unapproved booster shots bump recent days US.

Even looking stats found seem show parity misleading, US much better earlier access vaccine. Parity actually bit disappointment considering factors. 

I go much US hogging many doses world desperately craving - necessarily free, there's still many mid low income countries would love buy available doses. need switch delivery. promise food good, customers walking store, order in. 2021, amount companies straight offering delivery staggering CDC also real power actually enforce recommendations make, good they?

The CDC lot moral authority also, crucially, provides political cover organizations trying set policies. company show following CDC guidelines, gives powerful answer charges following best practices cavalier things.

The HR department large corporations take CDC's advice pretty much gospel, loathe recommend anything different liability reasons. Unfortunately, remains true even CDC's advice pretty obviously wrong lame. Interesting thought! Would love find out. Although quarantine taught makeup myself. actually started using products home lol (finally adapted real skincare routine) I’m fully vaccinated neither scared worried. trust vaccines level risk tolerance.

I’m sure define “horrible reaction,” flu shot live vaccine cannot cause flu. Sure, small percentage people feel weather post shot, due immune system it’s supposed do: building immunity vaccination. allergic reactions, true allergic reaction (think anaphylaxis), risks would outweigh benefits. Lastly, risk bad reaction increase subsequent flu vaccination, statement “which certain eventually…” grossly inaccurate untrue.  That's low risk ever going get.  I'm sure many people change views based well presented thought. What? looking ""[how many covid vaccines shows 363 million doses given US, including types was, point. Great thumbnail. area weeks ago saw decent amount masking. Fair enough.   sore arm, got chills 24 hours. girlfriend got side effects. really isn’t anything worry about. Terrorism How? government pretty notorious overcharged goods services, paying it. say they're paying everyone's medical bills, there's reason hospitals suddenly start charging less. Yeah I’ve given can’t reason talk sense. friends linked cdc website literally proving points wrong idea trying prove views nothing makes sense anymore. Maybe that's 201MM people? 205MM doses would 102.5MM people assuming everyone got two shots. demanding response someone medical degree answer legal question. would doctor know ins outs FDA approval? wow less 30, crikey. I’m sure paid company $100k+’for 100% anti vaxx, government appointment came around happily got soon could. good health medium age bracket, half people country got me. peace mind that.

so yeah think trepidation caution normal, FDA approval? donno, millions people taken vaccines point, FDA approval matter formality point. Ugh. Saw FB post showing development approval times previous vaccines. Person said exact same. ""Why rush?"" Well impression got media ""conventional"" mRNA, ""tried true"". Guess wrong huh Apple Iphone Homegrown taliban...almost every facist society push backs beliefs like this. think 2024 look forward too...sigh fair, high risk already scared. I'd rather safe sorry. also conditions would make hard time COVID. best friend, love want keep safe. [Welding doors apartment buildings shut acceptable tactic western ultra high definition VR porn finally convince everyone make push local ISPs... day... sad getting downvoted. CDC made perhaps biggest blunder saying vaccinated people could go maskless (completely ignoring fact unvaxxed would gleefully ditch well), New England great masks distancing. family's experience, Massachussetts strict protocols, Connecticut pretty strict well. work retail near 100% mask-wearing last year year reccomendations changed. shock see unmasked person store almost year.

Within couple weeks guidance changing, 70-80% masks among employees customers. Thankfully company reinstitued mandate 100% compliance employees, due news reporting breakthroughs such, customers 60-70% masked.

Distancing happening much though, except folks waiting line pay. opinion nurse show bloodtest proves high amount covid anti bodies fired taking vaccine? Even family members severe allergic reactions vaccine?

Take vaccine wear mask stop spouting politically/racially motivated garbage comments vaccines.

The thing superior delta variant …case point Bahrain, country predominantly Sinopharm vaccinated literally option major vaccines Pfizer, AZ even Sputnik.

I hopeful indicates return normalcy weather delta variant. 

I don’t get people read article vaccine efficacy knee jerk reaction tear apart it’s foreign aka inferior vaccine. rich people enemy. Covid proved many ways. much deadlier strain would never become truly dominant wouldn’t able spread many people right? Like sweet spot infection replication without killing infected quickly right?

Definitely canary coal mine. cannot life figure 2/3 Mississippians (or even 1 matter) won’t get vaccinated. much death suffering going take? It’s like third world country doesn’t trust medical professionals. real politik depending dies might end better rest Florida.

Most people comfortable Machiavellian things though Let management worry keeping jobs awhile slightly deadly Delta variant also greater immune evasion—creating far frequent contagious breakthrough cases—would also likely replace Delta highly vaccinated populations. what's point kinds what-ifs?  I'm already buddy. employer still WFH non-essential people want it. already made arrangements go office one day week things return ""normal."" time period? There’s nearly 100% chance death count crosses 700k. flu millions already. 

This mortality usually measured yearly basis cumulatively indefinitely. fulfilled Amazon, supposedly Amazon mixes product together, including counterfeits. something like this, would buy stores act marketplace third party sellers (i.e. ""Target Plus"") assume way compete Amazon cutting corner. sure much SPIKE even mutate that's advantageous virus itself.

Supposing optimise towards spread, towards antibody resistance, cost spread.

If that's case, expect see delta-like spread optimised variant boom first. latter possible, would always expected follow - carries compelling advantage first already burnt out.

We still survey possibility second. Well, yes. necessarily this. meant. Basically saying covid exposure inevitable. don’t know that’s conclusion got post. Really? thought I'm seeing federal tax Canada ~20% tax bracket, another 10% province tax Ontario. get taxes NYC (~30%-or all-in-all) I'm bit perplexed.  Yeah, that's really irrational. must horrible mental health too. nothing stopping getting unofficial 'booster shot' either. Gotchu fam Oh no.

Anyways... Yeah, understand anyone except petty control freaks would care.

Someone Reddit told vaccinated people dead 5 years LOL 11 found article months wrong died beginning February 2020 hospitalized January.  might want listen Mayo Clinic grand rounds posted main forum. data  reason reason bosses dont want remote working needed  slightly deadly variant creates far frequent contagious breakthrough cases would likely replace Delta highly vaccinated populations—so what's point kinds what-ifs? I'll wait till approve next week adult education sounds dreamy—PM ever need someone training! Lol srsly positive side covid... Life much better without polluting/paying gas wasted time it. enjoy time family. Okay, don’t disagree me. ask restrictions/mandatory guidelines haven’t heard officials.

It doesn’t make sense relying vaccines. don’t put restrictions/mandatory guidelines/lockdown ever number need hit vaccinations.

Why string along do? That’s unnecessary infections/deaths. plan don’t something plan known effective place. place numbers people act like doesn’t matter. aren’t war storm beach Normandy. literally set back take care people wait boosters, better vaccines, get ability clear hospitals. great point execs extroverts. new normal 🤷 new variant different characteristics now.

Forget this, worth it!

""But there's one uniquely Japanese term want relate to: karoshi, translates “death overwork”. Reports nation's corporate breadwinners, known “salarymen”, dropping dead overwork making headlines decades."" Lol even care exact stats last saw University Saskatoon sewage testing current cases 60% delta varient here. ""There going back"" - wishful thinking. That's fair, I'm sure mean imminent time frame really we're talking about.

To me, risk level acceptable combined mask mandates delta variant changed transmission rates significantly. Without mask mandates, virtual certainty schools superspreaders, would lead unacceptably high risk (even low mortality). 

Since mentioned cars, certainly consider risk acceptable anything close 1% chance death per ride. Similarly, close 1% chance death serious illness per infection, would consider risk acceptable. delta variant, multiple infections per semester per student certainly plausible (at least lieu mask mandates). go back office team meeting since March 2020 hope stays way foreseeable future. don’t mind going meet team, want everyday again? Hell no! sometimes miss chatting co-workers cubicles benefits working home FAR way me. done wonders mental health Someone told vaccinated people die 5 years. laughed told good luck surviving world. Yep! provincial election pandemic moved voting site enormous outdoor patio golf club. 

It minutes, outside distanced, dangerous thing happened got lost way almost walked right onto golf course. 2. Making solid defining line work hours hours

This one killer. one guy team insists working seven days week (seemingly) 24 hours day. constant friction getting drawn madness. worry bosses business owners, they're running organization effectively matter location employee works day. company never going back, we've outperformed numbers putting office everyone still outdated way thinking.  
I counted approximate number hours probably spent commuting life, 22 years. 8,000 hours life - away family, late games, dealing car issues, road rage, expenses came it. going back there's lot people longer work one plans so. said track efficiency, say simply worked hours. efficient, get amount work done less time, work? What’s end game then?  Ha, exact thing. I'll happily pay phone means feel paid right call 24/7. Thanks, fascinating. know too?  think relaxing mask mandate huge mistake done purely optics.

Purely optics sure. Instead dropping mask mandates, instated pressure campaign either reach 70-80% vaccinated masks stay. people hounding deadbeats like crazy get vaccinated. policy headphones earbuds. Pretty standard stuff. I've worked much toxic offices. issues place requiring proof vaccination. anti vax plaque rats ones prolonging ton rich mfers excited companies renewing office leases. try leverage lawmakers pass god damn law making harder average office worker work home. pretty well know high neutralizing antibodies partly responsible prevent infections happen. Ofc, still cellular response, definitely help make mild cases happen. 

There also preprint:

In Mumbai, according study, Delta able evade 20% 55% immune protection provided prior infection different variant. also seems aligned Gamma, study found 30% current infections supposedly happened previously already infected people. 
  mean eventually “Normal” also includes 1700s Japan btw. wife, sister got crazy sick February last year. sickest I've ever thought cold flu. pneumonia lasted months, well heart palpitations still fully resolved. time, thought bit early think COVID. live one areas saw early community spread US, though. We'll never know sure COVID. I'm convinced without time machine test. course die end. There's always magic person waiting prove stuff there? Like fox news leak Hunter's laptop day now...any day... Yeah, mom's hospital Arkansas converted recovery room overflow I.C.U. too. scrubs ICU work... great. Half staff looking leave higher pay. maths here. 330 million folks 100 million young get VAX, 175 million it. balance version risk vent ICU, move 17.5 million VAX Vent camp maybe Vent camp. Thats whole point this, lower total population hit hospital system well lower risk rate hospital comes.


The issue vaccine good alpha knocked like nothing. Delta thought customer seeing lessening effect care what’s covid levels response, hence operation booster coming online. 

So data points here. lowered total risk pool enough, started respond delta vaccine level. 

Truly missing leg mask mandate indoor events dinning. would snuff community spread. US fallen flat footed due optics back tracking Lmao “ever”. Jeez headline writers getting desperate Remote working, also known as, efficient effective working. WFH showing many layers middle management unnecessary long time. unexpected would fight livelihood traditional ""office supervision"". maybe know lot think waiting worth trade off? Bruh local high school 90 pos cases one week Telling people think moot people trust fox news enough take horse dewormer instead vaccine.

Not everything consider life measured jobs. available jobs fast food bullshit standards, wantinf 5 years experience 40 min quiz part resume. know calling person asshole - vaccinated unvaccinated people spreading Delta variant they're feeling totally fine. fiber home work less cloud based apps. math. [See …OR undergo regular testing usually talk yourself?   course that's case. Even concerned potential danger, someone vaccinated huge red flag point. probably means we're compatible wide variety reasons. I'm scheduled 1st shot tomorrow. Honestly speaking here...I wanted wait FDA approval. Yes, I'm one people. think shame cautious. body get one them. wanted due diligence result that. FDA approval gives recourse somewhere road complication arises. That's wanted.  windows open three inches. Something else Apple scan. Can't wait couple months situation managed? Delta variant popped up? Djimbe pronounced JimBay  It’s extremely dangerous, you’ll get situations like, oh asthma remission cancer, health insurance you.

You could argue maybe condition choice, cancer possibly due smoking? Excessive sun damage? Obesity? kinds obesity due choice? Standard MO them. Dad Pfizer, 5 months second dose Pfizer, 71 Diabetes Parkinson's, current 8 month rule, get third dose end November. want go rules dishonest get third shot, want either, I'm really worried current state things right now. really wish CDC would've allowed elderly get sooner. :( odd all, ""doubles down"" used like long remember (which thirty years).

This definetly _you_ thing. Guess I'll start calling SpikeVaxxer.    Good point. Maybe explanation paper,but made UK, probably little 3-4 week interval doses. , probably didn’t data conclude.  things happen microbiological scale freaky think closely macroscopic terms. basic level, viruses hijacking cells make copies themselves, usually leading death infected cells directly hands immune system. Pretty freaky. Covid exclusive syncytia formation, viruses also show biology   100% - China could kicking ass. time though, it’s proven part US underreported cases I’ve seen articles Russia, Brazil, India actually higher number cases, official counts. 
If it’s true awesome! would surprised case. pays test? Make employees get done somewhere pay may hasten desire obtain vaccine. find somewhere fake results I've already seen couple people mention another site.  Na, looks dumb cause dumb argument first place.  makes perfect sense - effect pf vaccination means bit like inluenza, proprotion people risk clinical infection, like natural immunity influenzas result living earth bunch years exposed previously.

Nope. desperately need someone else position fact refuse trained/taught current technology (MS Teams MS Outlook things) COVID era detrimental jobs. wasn’t arrested wanting protest arrested breaking COVID rules traveling states, plus people gathering cause infections, NSW like 500+ daily likely probably unvaxxed mask less seems could argue also public health that’s besides rules broke. viruses biological interest kill host, limits ability replicate. technically trying end human life. trying grow numbers quickly allowing host live long possible.

That sounds like viruses sort sentience though, wants. Clearly case. guess like biological machines designed optimize self manufacturing. aren’t saying vaccination promotes mutation you? correct. Mutations happen DNA replication viruses happens infected cell. vaccine helps immune system recognise kill virus gets chance infect cells. doesn’t infect cell doesn’t get chance replicate, can’t replicate, can’t mutate. zero exemptions entire planet mandated take vaccine.

I agree you.

I guess I'm thinking exemptions far since must approved.

Edit: furthermore, exempted, require nose testing twice week, let's say rather unpleasant.  I’ll let know find point point, way pessimistic predictions I’ve seen. people pictures dick-nosing masks?

It literally isn’t rocket science. change spike mrna vaccine still effective. Meaning care mutations outside spike ""CONSERVative"" !!! Begs question want conserve? friend recently accepted new position within current place employment. WFH, new position/department, required return office. soon found receive less 10 calls per day, already received notifications co workers testing positive. 

Multiple people, scheduled 9 hours day, sit wait around office, someone maybe call in. 

As right now, absolutely miserable. stress risk all. People tested Friday still havent results yet. oh no, pumped real estate investments paying off? gonna cry little ceo boy? idiots take dewormers wash bleach good measure. speak primary care physician. Indeed vaccines work, virus proved works better. People still getting sick, dying getting neurological damage unacceptable numbers spite vaccinated. That's problem people insist rely 100% vaccines nothing else.

Are seriously arguing nothing vaccination needed control pandemic? sorry loss Depends commercial real estate mean. Offices fucked, well, bad offices are. High class meeting spaces good facilities still valued HQs client meeting places.

On hand, logistics hubs, supermarket delivery, light industrial roof. broad industry. would rather fight one horse-sized duck thousand duck-sized horses? found redundant say covid either die survive, 100% statement saying. Maybe I’m nit picky caught widespread testing thats random

China really figured early pandemic. want ""zero covid"", must test everyone region find hidden spread. School starting tomorrow I'm freaking 3yr old son. daughter 16. live outskirts st louis missouri. cant sleep I'm panicking seeing Mayo Clinic ground rounds.  EXO-CD24 experimental ""precision"" medication inhalation, developed Professor Nadir Arber Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical aim halt ""cytokine storm"" affects lungs approximately 5-7 per cent covid-affected patients. occurs immune system starts attacking healthy cells extra cytokine works, explains: ""We suppressing altering immune system [like steroids], rather restoring normality controlling aspect system causes cytokine storm, over-reaction immune system often cause serious covid illness."" Lmao conservatives act every time run me. give guys attitude think I'm actually scientist. hilarious break down. no, many countries regions within USA proving right now, locally reduce cases even think ""the cat bag""

70-90% deaths preventable, comes politicized early conservatives sub-classes morons cooperating. Thems facts bucko literally ask test vaccinated. Seems

We Aarogya Setu helps kind things integration CoWIN Aadhar, presumably works well case Gov puts good use purpose. think used right though.

I think America Aadhar though remember day outbreak went SW - lot people knew point compliance reducing mobility going enough  futile - element luck.

If go hard early better chance receiving luck, guarantee.

BTW, thats strawman sydney didnt try contain - rather silly really - genuine One shot doesnt help much Delta though. Much better completely unvaccinated esp. older age groups needs double provide necessary pace could surpass US vaccines per capita 2 weeks.

Which great level totally insufficient deal delta variant unless also enact strong social distancing/lockdown measures.... evident surge hospitalization currently happening many parts US. Japanese sensible comes wearing masks thus likely fare better given vaccination rate. Nonetheless get hopes double vaccination rate reaches around 70% total population. ""Anecdotal evidence usually based individual experiences observations, distinct probalistic evidence gives estimates likely something occur based experience large numbers people."" true I'm individual telling another individual sharing data, individual shared data professor epidemiology data collected several labs hospitals around city. Now, believe believe me. pretty clear stand. OK cool, literal expert, Dad tough beat Tyson boxing match. Everything saying ""no shit captain hindsight"", seeded widely beyond borders China cat bag. state population 114 million, vaccinating 1 million people day lot tbh I’m never going back. new job pays six figures make go back office I’ll take pay cut start looking elsewhere sub think post even removed change title.

And tbh correct rule change words subtly name providing context reasonable title cause slight know word think proper English. 

Aah. guess case fine (not sarcastic BTW).

Initially felt people read it, realized word used primarily India downvoted that. yeah NZ could heading trouble, go almost nothing Delta Variant spread, good. virus, beat first time. Entirely. incredibly dumb way try address mask shortage later led people believing masks didnt help experts said beginning health professionals need them. fear lead similar outcome. many times country done it? need believe me, believe eyes. 

What fuck this? video ants? barely see anything distance resolution even tell majority wearing masks.

EDIT: Also, even Harajuku before? Everyone wearing masks, really now. Claiming Delta Covid less virulent flu disinformation pure simple. Please correct post. think two weeks Federal aid run out.

Back July California cut unemployment looking work, heard affect. 6 weeks - whenever still 20's etc less depress need see colleagues everyday, take rest whenever want long done task. ofc are, 17x, still pretty small number, scarry enough, would go 30 50x 5 years..

New Zealanders: done 21 times before. again. creates HUGE statistical error rate unfortunately. hate ""NSW anything"" become standard narrative. 

NSW exactly dozen hotel quarantine leaks Aggressive contact tracing, isolation potentially infected people lots testing. Delta changed rules. thesis even tried hard possible improve vaccines everyone got immunity anyway

I quite confident proven wrong near future. Sorry rest text wall, perhaps could try bit concise. actually apolitical never voted before

Well explains lot... Obviously time get kids back school. guess we'll start seeing K-12 schools require vaccines eligible.

I wonder businesses allowing work home handle this. Struggling businesses probably consider enforcement well. Good Jesus, creep. information. never blamed Mexicans Canadians spreading corona.. That's weird made thing head. blame people refuse get vaccines.... think league legends rotted brain out. wound super tight popping randos reason. I'm blocking moving on.. cause supposed Corona. putting words mouth change fact I'm educate you. course full lockdowns applied anywhere, masking up, contact tracing, etc. taught century public health policy programs enacted past pandemics. course mentioning regions hit hard currently, virus already established there, totally moot point. preventing initial virus spreading regions, via methods, could easily prevented lot death. think specifically talking Bangladesh, favela Rio, use simple context clues/intelligence figure yourself? Clearly can't even get Florida cooperate, USA took initial leadership position stopped spread, governments would've followed. 

By changing tense argument past future/current, totally disingenuous. yes, real scientist upsetting sounds. know probably anti-lockdown, really best thing besides masking up.  countless studies topic, like reading. engage someone making total strawmen arguments like attempting remember first case Ireland.

No need believe me, [believe Webcam Shibuya crossing. Try find anyone wearing mask. (You see clearly bottom left corner nearest camera.)

You may complain mansplaining, truth, nobody ever forced it. may complain people deny easily verified reality. Australia already one those.

Cool reddit scientist all, make immune wishful thinking.  you, 100%. course right statistics work, point patient's shoes, stats become pretty meaningless/irrelevant.  They're effectively trying inverse - cutting pay people work remote.

Good luck that. economy good, people quit work company pays deserve.

I think early say happen long-term, guess wages stay same. current wages lowest companies thought could get away paying still attracting talent needed.

If Joe's Widgets tries drop wages Bill going work home, makes easy Bob's Buffalos hire Bill away them.

Some companies want workers person managers know supervise looking someone's shoulder. Others want workers person think easier get people work long hours give free snacks foosball tables. Others want person think ideas generated watercooler chats, want ideas.

But, none reasons make work better employee. One dose helps. Two doses helps lot. need get one dose get two. island, country continent time. know applies everyone, young woman feel like especially applies demographic. It’s way, way important stroke boss’s ego actually get work done. I’m likely spectrum, although never diagnosed. I’ve recently realized this. I’m good wish would realized sooner. Also applied college, professors seemed grade petty shit like often time well dressed (no, don’t mean would get better grades wore revealing clothes, looked like put effort basically thought afraid them) way actual test scores… I'm bioinformatics scientist advised CDC, want information, attach reality. get cocky, apply measures anywhere. horrible political leadership early garnering adherence dummies impossible good job keeping record they'd employers start requiring vaccines? keep seeing kind comment really seems detached reality. isolated small population south pacific, hours flight nearest neighbours. nice other, wars poverty either! understand attraction wishful thinking like that, world demonstrably like that. Like others said, really depends county county breakdown. example, I'm DuPage county Illinois one highly vaccinated (top 5 think?) counties entire country. still wear mask outings canceled Thanksgiving/Christmas delta wave over.

Can't say Southern Illinois, time worried people coming north home later year. That’s really true. Masks indeed common much Asia pandemic, social distancing measures taken pandemic definitely weren’t, main thing affecting people’s quality life, measures people see unsustainable. even masks way less widespread became pandemic, part necessarily huge deal. another one one. then, everyone get booster shot. then, new variant..... repeat sentence 1. Thanks link. wondering things going China. Twenty years later we're still back life 9/11

I think there's intrinsic reason masking *can't* become new normal. like it, like taking shoes airport either that's still us. :( hour way minimum, plus errands take nap bed lunch. ages 12? quoting US officials thoughts containing covid based flawed US response. country like NZ effectively implement different strategy going different result. approach different citizenry NZ far compliant. know what's stake (as whole) selfish way Americans are.

So answer question, understand comparisons, confusing apples oranges.  rhetoric always precedes runaway infections. Must sort delay, yes behind currently. bad Vietnam, delta would still absolutely burn poulation that's 20% fully vaxxed. NZ caught vaccination drive another 2 months probably. better get current outbreak control, could get real bad. Yep. I’m agreeing you. Novel concept, isn’t it?  someone lives tourism based economy, huge double edged sword. ton people would love live place world class skiing, mountain biking, hiking, fishing, etc., reality economy places blows. Basically service very, boom bust construction industry (far cities).

With remote work expanding, lot money year round. season slow down, nothing like normally is. Businesses traditionally would close month season seriously considering going year round now. People making money ever, particularly tipped wage economy.

However...the housing rental markets gone insane. rent went 20% I'm one lucky ones. actually got lease renewed I'm lucky landlords like me. actual market rate unit doubled. I've lost several friends make faced unsustainable rent increases simply option renew lease. dozens workers homeless, living Forest Service land crashing friends. come late Fall...they either place they're gone. Basically every business understaffed near breaking point that's despite employers raised wages considerably. Legacy businesses would open 360+ days year closed 1-2 days week now. Hours getting slashed. People bought well that, renters seeing raises go rent finding harder harder save enough payments. 

I think remote work great white collar workers normally live near select number major metros. effect real estate mountain towns going devastating local workers. Oh may pay people livable wages get go back work? Boo hoo Parents try avoid even low-risk things could kill kid really hasn’t though. vaccines still work. workplace similar. Would act like insanely urgent ramble fucking weekend 20 minutes. 

My old boss 100% wanted attention, would greatly preferred ask personal life make small talk actually productive. smarter done guess grossed out.  distinction NZ trying contain it, Sydney didn't.

If fire started small, someone watched turn large fire asking fire stop, proof someone else sees small fire, futile try put grows big That’s said. worked dozen hotel quarantine leaks previous year. Delta changed rules. Im lovin it

Im never going back

Haha suck at&amp;t simple answer is...no one knows really. indications waning immunity 6 months new data showing value getting booster. trying make call loved one would look booster 80 year old loved one probably hold unless compounding health concerns high levels exposure. Well, far NSW couple months - Victoria cases crossed border closed related. crossed border ACT that's small city completely surrounded NSW good example. far see authors write participants study chosen. sign experiment chosen random population? graphs impressive, would nice little  saying eight weeks ago handful cases. fair comparison would vaccinated+Delta fatality rate vaccinated+Flu fatality rate. know answer strongly suspect Delta considerably deadly. that. Covid causes brain damage, even rare. Covid simply flu, like flu. something new horribly different. Please disservice trying minimize fact.

If need make analogy something, make analogy polio. certainly treat polio like flu never will, long term effects devastating. never ""just live with"" polio, always best eradicate whenever gets tiniest foothold.

I doubt much influence way other, frankly. making medical decisions based people Internet calling names, clearly larger think making people angry bad idea.

And think making sick refusing get shot bad others way want treated yourself.

Yes, thinking others great thing do. want people safe reasonably possible. got vaccinated. wish people would show courtesy. Anything goes groupthink downvoted. yes, epidemiologist stated. found interesting too. get significant start antibodies mom. utero breastmilk. Otherwise, babies would zero immune systems upon birth last long cold hit them. still bad bad could be. also assuming true, it’s uniform across board. Wages gone last 30 years, that’s kinda silly statement. 

Also, assuming increased productivity working home, case. would surprised bulk people less productive average home, small subset people optimal setups increasing productivity home. (No kids, extra room, etc)

I tell I’m productive home, none peers are, none friends companies are, etc. people really pushing WFH purely selfish treasons (and that’s ok) like small child. Hell, non-insignificant portion social circle fully admits don’t want go back office they’re less work home before, money. 

I would love see hard facts productivity. People saying they’re productive home time deliverables cut, creating image getting work done, actually delivering less. Hell, it’s happened me. customers company starting pan us releases slowing less features. things, complex issue major economic ramifications workers personal comfort. say someone wants WFH forever. chance would possible guys vote someone else next time?  OP, please fix title.

Study ""patients moderate severe COVID-19"" job outsourced received generous severance package - took gap year intending resume employment - COVID happened. Retired 62 instead. one better life choices.  Completely different gathering people protesting lockdowns breaking safety rules put place prevent virus spread. protests local, participants. create significant level infections.

Young kids home, living alone isolated, living roommates feeling crowded, etc. daughter ""too many roommates"" situation, can't wait go back office.

I'm starting believe situations love WFH, wide variety situations hate it.  reality tasks eventually reach menu-like stasis, client pay become accustomed paying. efficient norm, benefit; less efficient, lose out.

Most large corporate clients insurance firms billing auditors routinely arbitrarily cut bills, constant arm's race try get paid work actually lawyer. criticisms lawyers over-billing fair, countermeasure arbitrarily cutting time even lawyers over-bill ethical lawyers cheat. lot like medical bills eventually get paid percentage doctor charges, doctor eventually raises rates try bring real dollars up. back forth becomes arm's race.

At end day thing client really cares hourly rate amount hours worked, total amount spent file versus result. consistently get excellent results, pay them.

Although I’m sure it’s factor. reading comprehension skills pretty lacking. Go back read post again. weren’t calling outbreak “real serious” calling steps needed completely stamp oubreak “real serious”. in, testing everyone multiple times strictly locking serious level draconian restrictions.

They’re saying delta hard contain you’re crying “hysteria”. I've tried explain people. Afghanistan, really functioning government much country (even last year Taliban officially took over). time people knew Covid was, world. parts world millions people moving countries (both without permission). People seem think government able better, would gone away, places option tight border control highly functioning government. Covid different SARS transmissible. Euro 2020 final super spreader. (covid) came home  New Zealand one best responses world go deaths per million. I’m New Zealand it’s definitely one places protect human life. Humans always human. Florida.

You selling bumper sticker? I’ll believe see it. Despite massive amount population showing stupidity seldom seen, none us ever seen world come together many aspects combat this. course could way better, 7 billion people planet, lot good done  Try remember millions people got vaccine completely fine! know easier said done, peace mind know J&amp;J blood clots even rarer men (if username accurate). Well actually someone walk little scared, waited outside, much easier then. pretty bizarre see...usually much level-headed. resorts personal insults folks challenge point view well. cause false positives? Exactly US vaccination method trying stomp vaccination stamped without vaccines don’t high need Tons them.  nurses work sell multi level marketing shakes swear essential oils colloidal silver.

Mitigation strategy. strict lockdowns European countries early 2020, since Summer 2020, overriding strategy simply manage epidemic - end Denmark, Germany, Spain, Greece US *vastly* different strategies.

Implementing somewhat stricter somewhat looser restrictions businesses, somewhat looser stricter lockdowns, context overall policy mitigation, constitute *vast* difference book, particularly compared countries actually pursued eradication. Denmark, Germany, Spain Greece gone roughly waves ended deaths/population similar range. China New Zealand hundredfold lower death rates Denmark, best-performing country listed.

If want see actual eradication strategy looks like, read China's responses recent Delta variant outbreaks. strategy trace every single infection quickly end transmission. Entire cities millions people tested days. Every single infection contact-traced, virtually entire transmission chain mapped out, known contacts quarantined. There's simply comparison Europe US, perspective China, responses Spain Denmark different one another. reputation violent maniac somewhat overblown. He's certainly volatile, photographer punched back 80s paparazzi, guys make career pissing people off. deal 24/7, might thing. rumours abusing torturing Madonna together, I've read, there's really evidence true. headlines clickbait. mean people can't bothered read article, who's fault it?

The headlines accurate science show less effectiveness delta also includes duration since immunized well else would know bitchin' shirt wearing? Terrible post. Small observational study - 15 patients without real control group randomization treatment. none patients ventilator, requiring oxygen.
This contributes nothing discourse. best hypothesis generating observation. fuck? get suckers mine! dicks! /s track COVID 3rd leading cause death month, summer time, school session, mask usage still pretty good. 

And daily death continually increasing already, despite basically every advantage going favor moment. 

What's going happen school session winter comes?  
I think alternating lockdown might fine solution, definitely think UK ""out pandemic"" 
The reason able go lockdown flu cases actually go summertime. Right?! trust vaccine, studied, tested, proven effective safe humans, trust deworming drug used studied proven safe effective covid, meant cows. Yet, get sick Covid (or de-wormer), they'll run hospital.

Of course incredibly unstable countries poor countries able allocate vaccines people. perfectly, much better nothing.

We real chance saving lives here. Let's squander it. realized modeRNA.

Fuck me! Give break, people choosing ideology lives worse peoples lives; assholes sugarcoating change fact minds. obvious military, give zero fucks requiring everyone. Healthcare organizations would seem good candidates well.

I'm curious see large consumer-facing corporations start requiring employees (not HQ). Someone like Walmart, FedEx, McDonalds. There's probably level calculus happening terms much workforce they'd expect quit mandate, particularly entry-level roles. FDA comes across toothless much bullshit American diet.

That said, great work 👍 it'll ""BUt APpRovEd fAsT!"" Sigh.  Maybe... Maybe not. Chinese Government tried keep secret instead coming clean.

Definitely sounds like character dystopian future everything decided life death volleyball matches.    almost guarantee work mandates it.

I'm positive turn ""The company decided require vaccination order promote healthy safe work environment...you ""X"" date prove full vaccination order continue career here.""

No, don't. wharever CIA tells to. propaganda machine, real news. workplace started requiring us back months ago basically said we'll never go 100% back WFH regardless bad Delta gets.

They'd rather risk someone coming sick get everyone else sick let employees work home. really matter time point. think stubbornness actually caring employees. Pretty bad combination. Irony - knew vaccines would approved base pushing maximum vaccination based that; offered Moderna. Pfizer approved military require it, vaccine tell diocese Covington norther Kentucky *Lambda Legit thrilled vaccine mandates roll That's anyways, offered booster might well take it.

The shots going go elsewhere, due policy decisions Biden administration. strongly disagree decisions think immoral.

The clearly speaking governments/policy makers, people like me. “where deaths” person, still am. guess previous posts got lost message cared vaccinated, child, &amp; immunocompromised deaths. don’t care people dying Covid refused vaccine. 

At point aren’t going put major social barriers place people aren’t vaccinated best move society open everything let willfully unvaccinated get Covid either get natural immunity, get scared getting vaccinated, shut society, die.

It also Indian media source reporting achievement Indian state makes sense use Early fifties, anti-vax/anti-mask city &amp; state. Fully vaccinated tested positive. I’ve wearing N95s I’ve go somewhere too, take asthma med makes susceptible respiratory infections. 

Stuffy nose, sore throat, headache, occasional chills. got monoclonal antibodies 2 days testing positive. symptoms gone night. 

Wear mask, preferably N95 better, anytime go indoors, close people outdoors. Fleeting contact takes Delta. 

If test positive, see qualify monoclonal antibodies. (Your doctor saying you’re high risk it, even don’t identified risk factors.) theres many benefits remote work companies truly proves stupid taking advantage this. always thought whole ""70% vaccinated herd immunity"" arbitrary nonsense

It's actually not, derived mathematical formula: 1 - 1/R0. R0 number people infected person infects population without immunity scientific property virus. take immunity account, call R eff instead R0.

So R0 3, 1/R0 1/3, 1 - 1/R0 2/3, 66%. words, infected person infects R0 (3) others average, 2/3 vaccinated (assuming perfect immunity), infected person infects one person, R eff 1. tipping point, R eff goes 1, COVID starts collapsing goes away, call herd immunity.

There's problems though. major one Delta changed COVID's R0 around 3 around 7 so. changes herd immunity around 85%. Then, there's issue vaccines give perfect immunity, also benefit natural immunity infection counts too, two offset one another somewhat, hard tell exactly ways. need make change. Force it. government needs make everything 40 time half. companies won’t want us working ot. believe Venice County dashboard. OC need go county's site, recently check SGV Riverside numbers. Agreed 100%. 

But, one thing people (although it’s anxiety inducing it) set boundaries. it’s past 8pm I’m getting dinner, I’ll let emails/calls wait, unless it’s urgent snd I’ll respond I’m away get X time.

You right source. sub think post even removed change title. thrives surveying serfdom.  UK pop 60 million - 130k deaths

US pop 330 million - 640k deaths

Iran pop 83 million, sanctions functioning modern healthcare system, religious leaders banned western vaccines.

378k sounds high feasible, Russia 140 million pop 500k excess deaths. Let's keep remote work permanent. office made sense technology enable work home.

Busted ankle ice getting lunch car 2017. chance ice that. Mtg cards random crop floor maybe. watching this, sane people would jump get vaccinated. something want happen brain avoidable. actually one reason company still working home -- got lot new customers past year hiring bunch new people, wanted actually give chairs office, we'd need bigger office. keeping people home, avoid need rent bigger office. Sounds like cage indeed. conflated fatality rate transmission rate. know point here?

My point achieving zero covid cases going happen, even former FDA commissioner agrees CDC taking stringent (and opinion unreasonable) steps make happen United States. Apply companies don’t think you’re good enough for, time. cases linked people it, they're people expect it. extensive testing waste water far covid detected suburbs knew was. Testing 1% population per day world leading, there. That's 10 people per thousand, context US peak testing 6 people per thousand. Testing one tool, plenty deployed.

If can't get groceries die. get groceries mask wearing mandatory, there's limit many people supermarket dairy once, social distancing required. feel jobs done home need stay way environments sake. unused office spaces, malls outdoor strip malls turned schools level returned green space. two cents. woah ther partner. Dude job less money. year, tons emails well company doing. Record amount new clients boarded employees working excessively long hours (14-15hours everyday) make increased workload. Come appraisal time- oh well know covid can't give much bonus increments matter. 
People got increments literally 2 digits. one first ones door. thesis seems ""we already trying hard can, can't better"". response is: utter rubbish. Many us still calling hoax one thing.

To pick one item very, large stack: every person free supply N95 masks? beyond manufacturing distribution technology, beyond financial means? gives that?

No, certainly know even suggested it. dog trainer's perspective working home situation beneficial humans family. Dogs social creatures need also experience outside world regularly day simulate scavenger lifestyle rangers. 8 hour work day + commute allow families. 

Then see breakdown dog's wellbeing often comes behavioral issues severe. Left unchecked kills good dogs lands shelter system life. problems escalate become unmanageable. unnecessary suffering everyone involved, stemming unsustainable outdated model working. course, rinse repeat next dog.

A yard enough. 30 minutes walking around block enough. Sadly love treats showered dog home enough either, that's best many soul sucking work is. Corporations adopted open plan offices cheap walls parts interiors cram people inside thus maximizing effectiveness office space owned. adopted ""smart"" working/desking maximize even more. reason want next step going full remotely. can't find reason beyond control every minute employees workday. New startup companies getting founded constantly permanent remote hiring lure top talent. Working stable large company meaningless there’s dozens don’t care live.  recruiters start complaining corporate can’t get Senior talent anymore applicants keep asking remote…corporate decide let recruiters leave too…. stop talent drain offering workers want. maths - thats ignore unknowns make assumptions. specialty epidemiologists, floating kinds assumptions running multiple models ultimately pointless.

Why pointless?

Because transmission effect vaccines known empirically population.

Because control many people get vaccinated, vaccinated twice, indeed many get boosted track.

Finally, immunity waning thing (hinted booster), herd immunity might months till isnt, either immunity waning doses people wrong, virus changes selects vaccinated population.

These reasons Infectious diseases specialists dont harp herd immunity, virologists - curiously topic epidemiologists, especially non clinical ones .

FWIW, quite respect epi's start this, predictions almost universally far actual outcomes seem limited usefulness. coworkers friends. Speak yourself. Would lot suspected early deaths blood samples still around? I'm guessing no. highly contagious spread adults rapidly. moot point places, since covid endemic countries. Vietnam Australia also running. really regions left potentially maintain zero covid. got China, New Zealand, Hong Kong, Taiwan, maybe Singapore. 

Looks like Singapore might abandon zero covid try new live delta approach, aided high vaccination rates. New Zealand, I'd probably still give real good try see go back zero covid. vaccination rates way behind countries. US, UK, Israel etc 50% fully vaccinated levels, delta still ripping American south like crazy. 20% New Zealand fully vaccinated. handful ICU beds swamped time delta took hold country. 

As China, know long plan continue rather fanatical approach zero covid strategy. gotta pretty expensive exhausting organize mass testing events constantly, central government must feel like worth it. Certainly good propaganda them. constantly remind people able keep virus bay year now, even new delta variant. New Zealand goes under, say country widespread lockdown local transmission. also ones likely miss hero worship, ego stroking, general sucking up. 

And get crack whips play mind games. mum late 50s won’t get either, doesn’t want “an experiment” put rushed vaccines body. massive fear distrust around vaccines. also says even get vaccine still spread it, she’s annoyed government trying force care workers get one, doesn’t make less likely spread it.

Plus cases “low” area apparently. I’ll send doubt help. hell convince them? longer people put office harder control. Wage slavery works many vectors forcing people travel location + micro managing workers &amp; wasting time huge part it. 

We gotta end wage slave meta. reading lot pessimism lately. Thought getting better, dang. Reading things really kills mood. 

Back June-July cases deaths US going down, thought, “Man. We’re finally coming this. It’s time.” guess, admittedly, stupid think. 

I’m fully vaccinated, wish pandemic would end. don’t see thing ending. feels like it’s People Vs. Virus, virus winning.  Whoa, really creepy. may happen human cells degree? he's admitting he's ok masks school part dress code? developed nations, children cannot attend public school day-care without vaccinated. So, vaccine mandates existed prior pandemic. Oh. No.

Anyways... Yup. 90% restaurants fail first year regardless markets. great place be. 

Hopefully large office buildings get variances residences housing prices fall. coming like not.. 

I read somewhere national chains like Starbucks McDonald's really good many independents shutting doors. great, good new read morning quarantined multiple container ships steady stream cases MIQ via planes. Ship crews tend get sick together show big groups 10-20 cases sound dramatic they're easier handle. example, last month: get 1000 overseas ship visits year process 4000 people *fortnight* MIQ. - much easier track test individual ships constant stream arrivals churning MIQ. Plus, ship months get even get infected last port call, time get showing full blown testable symptoms arrival. People coming plane another country 12 hours beforehand much higher risk infected without even knowing it. already transitional facilities imported goods like free attempt track Covid top cases *arrived* covid went isolation. another 16% (495) cases caught directly people (and number includes people quarantine together) - rampant uncontrolled infectious visitors crew, infecting least many people again. see way numbers explode rare leaks community itself, one person every months leads another 20% cases reset zero again. sure, maybe rich people sneaking - many drama around getting MIQ spaces, isolating elsewhere (.e.g. US ambassadot last year), all. Charter flights plummeted visitors still required land approved airport go isolation , aircrew tested regular (aircrew probably biggest risk factor, that's private vs commercial thing).

There’s labor shortage bruh…. got cards left hold :/ know saying ""the price freedom eternal vigilance"" right? would say vague, hmm? try fill dots you.

Do talk like real life? Also saying make sense context. Freedom thing stake can't perfect vigilance virus spreads like one. Even everyone need better vaccines.

We get them. next 2 years. people even ones yet ones large part product decade SARS1 MERS research. update sequence match Delta mRNA vaccines utility minimal efficacy vaccines still high Delta (95% reduction serious illness death) they're single-digit percentage points less effective Delta preventing infection. truth designing vaccine that's 100% effective probably impossible coronaviruses we're likely close we're going get really long time. People get COVID19 become endemic materially improve vaccines. vigilance perfectly clear. means can't let guard. must prepared respond immediately effectively every single outbreak, among things. vague that?

You're repeating yourself. ""we can't let guard"" saying exact thing ""we must vigilant""

*HOW* propose respond ""effectively""? think we've trying world limited success year? vaccines best short time we've 20% people get - that's places they're actually available. COVID already spread point containable without vaccination, people either going get vaccinated get virus endemic like flu. There's stopping happen develop perfect magical vaccine.

We're already watching COVID cases. human race focused single thing much long since WW2. propose improve? Test 10x many people do? Test everyone every day? wonder gels UCLA study showed massive spike respiratory illness la area December 2019?

Almost definition starts cases household members - spread outwards thats caught widespread testing thats random - hope catch it, prepared - melburnites supremely confident days ago

;( mean many service folks retrain/self-study tech reap benefits. firm seems slowly changed tune they're still hiring developers can't find people otherwise. Meanwhile I'm getting messages LinkedIn daily fully remote jobs companies based across country. said Trudeau pandering fringe base. SMH What’s point boss manager don’t actually boss manage get shit done? Yup. However fewer toll worker, security, coffee shop work. mom get vaccinated got Covid worse sinus infection! body, choice! s/ 

Is support group people whose parents think like this? Every day ideal Mandatory vaccinations incredibly slippery slope. mandate everyone get get flue shot, would save lives, measles vaccine epidemic. Fucking slippery slope.

Yes I'm fully vaccinated Yeah live apartment feels like prison 24/7. would love go office least sometimes I'll grant something highly specialized one thing, 95% office software jobs done remotely easily replaced overseas. 

Finance included, (if mean trading/investments). Payroll often administrative functions decentralized. People knowingly foregoing vaccine would protect society well them. Instead, continue spread mutate deadly virus. killing people luckily see effects actions directly. still responsible deaths, however, people indeed murderers. one tolerant murderers. part part society. IFR highly dependent population demographics medical care. early part Europe North America's pandemic, appeared hover around 0.8%, would expected substantially lower lot elderly (ie, much developing world), substantially higher critical health care swamped (essentially everyone needs ICU bed get one dies). 

Iran largely underwent demographic transition last 30 years (now 2.14 births per woman), approaching European/North American demographics. quite surge capacity critical care developed nations, medical system suffered U.S. led sanctions. dont really understand want workers back office? company clearly workers work home. Everyone saving money certainly feeling better use downtime something around house rather sitting lunch room. So, required go back office? one person company told reason than.... cause management said so. Yes, people want believe they're easily expendable. reason companies hire people relocate synergy osmosis. want hire people sit home, hire talented person India something fraction cost? think researchers managed go back antibody test stored blood donations organizations like Red Cross collected late 2019 researchers aware COVID19 spreading US. normal workers talking great work home been, boss spent day reading bullshit articles like [this need organize keep work home benefits. boss *not* want them. Fight it. oh yeah, get that...but I'm referring CEOs, etc seem think employees going invent next Twitter chance meeting water cooler CEO missing chance Silicon Valley bigshot. feel same, ideal would sort hybrid/flex model office 2-3 days week home rest reddit, anti social social media, ever hear people enjoy working home. may anecdotal evidence people work know also sent home. single one wanted stay home! I'm also Scandinavian probably work culture different actually get along coworkers time anyway.
I think kind posts clearly show anti social users reddit really are. Congrats. May wonderful you!! probably rig 4 new lawn mowers together rate. Cut mowing time 😁 something suggested company U.K.: 

Hi folks,
 
I’ve given consideration this, would like suggest rules satisfy flexible work offering SD:
 
I based on: 23 SD staff (8x 24/7 engineers, 15x Core shift).
 
 
Image
Image
Image
 
 
Each engineer must come 40% time
Each day must least 5 people physically rota’d shift

Each day must 10 engineer schedule

We split WFH days given week choice Monday+Tuesday Thursday+Friday. grants opportunity “extended weekend feeling” all.
 
Q: 40% submission physical occupation?
A: TeamLead stated Service Desk requires obligatory 15% physical office presence working day.
 
Q: impact skill availability?
A: doesn’t, based purely resource, availability across core teams working week. average 8 engineers physically within office space.
 
Q: managed?
A: Either scheduling app/portal engineers self-sign (first come first serve) commit fulfilling weekly hours, assigned TLs.
 
Q: solution address 24/7 flexibility?
A: Whilst 24/7 day shift must attend office space, 24/7 night shift fulfil duties home.
 
 
This open adjustments leave pot discussion practical application business.
 
Thanks”


Glad say adopted 👌🏼

Before COVID happened company target turn £200m, purchased new HQ £15m. signed contract, grace period passed COVID happened. unable back deal, since working within regulations U.K lockdowns government guidance, continue new head office plan. lost employee pandemic, fact they’ve increased employment due demand clients working remotely, projects. hospitals government clients technical support, actually classed support workers, got full 80% furlough offered didn’t need take it.

Covid sped work home culture, change ways set lose good employees.

Mental health cited one major drivers large majority workers effected. personally wfh, social distancing wearing mask public since 2019 wife started chemotherapy mastectomy. norm us long Covid came along.

I think need physical space, lot clients say office place separate home work life. I’ve never issue, fact blessed seen son grow since birth 2019. get spend time playing him, look wife home “on time” work late want to. hour longer doesn’t kill me, fact believe start earlier finish time happy work later.

I think sales people need physical connection banter colleagues, it’s nature beast.

I know lot clients companies interviewed for, WFH massive positive performance output time people got complacent lazy efficiency actually back slide. 

WFH definitely stay, degree capacity offered another thing.

Ps feel free use wfh flexible working plan 😅👍🏼 Asia mask indefinitely, mask know infected, reduce chance becoming infected certain circumstances. normal times. times emergency now, that's masking universal. point is, things firmly ingrained social norms, much rest world still whining expending stupid amounts effort trying deny new imperatives. New Zealand population 5 million

We cities 10 million+ population NZ well island easy ability control borders

Easier tbh Yeah home 24/7 like tanked mental health too. I’m personally hoping sort hybrid/flex model spend 2-3 days office others home Masks required area while. always baffled folks wearing masks anyway, insisted noses sticking out. Like, cared COVID enough wear mask to, wore incorrectly completely defeated purpose it. 

People stupid. amazing species survived long. kidding hence taking SCOTUS attorneys DOJ rewrite case

You.... know works, you? POTUS can't mandate anything beyond federal control, outside expansion powers via amendment constitution. 

Congressional power mandate held check constitution. constitution specifically grant powers, automatically fall state. Public health mentioned constitution, state determine manage things inside borders.

In words, even Congress passed law Biden issued executive order, number states would immediately sue injunction, circuit courts would grant injunction hold implementation law order, SCOTUS would shoot unconstitutional - *is*.

Some relevant reading: Singapore also done pretty good job quashing Delta outbreak. We're around 35 cases day close \~200ish even recently mid-July. federal government mandate school receives federal funds must require masks. looking reinfection rates able find much aside ""2.3 times likely vaccinated..."" stuff.

Do source talks actual reinfection rates? I'd interested looking it. Especially since, based comment, would major confirmation bias boost me. never get enough confirmation bias. Get vaccinated, get kN95 N95, avoid large gatherings. words, take precautions preventative measures available you, engage reckless behavior, risk minimal. concern with. Stay safe there. want live life, too. That's I'm frustrated thing keeps dragging selfish people willing make short term sacrifices needed solve problem all, actually get normalcy back. say saw guy say stuff happening one city. nothing anecdote that.  Thanks! I’ll look up. Ditto bud. Senior manager knowledge work field running large team. Within local group, we're (a) requiring anyone anything 2022 least (b) time ""normal"" back disease-wise, planning coordinate event-driven pull folks come in, in-person. Suggested in-person. talked types things would make sense - half-to-full day seminars hands learning, small group project sprints, really dense problem solving. That's it. I'm asking managers never suggest someone come day full day, stack days people showing 2 hour meeting whatever, schedule least week two (preferably) advance folks plan around it.

A lot peers older generations think team's plan fully-wacko planning 3 4 days week office. We're thinking like fortnight... maths off, 1% would 800k deaths Delta around long enough data.  idiots rural Snohomish county come Seattle year Seahawks game, tbf Living Alberta scares crap see cpc government blanket Canada shit policies right win Thanks! right click, incognito (private browsing, etc) pretty sure mutating rate always has. That's like getting herpes grateful HIV. Sure. Stay safe! One overlooked advice: improve ventilation! C02 used good proxy clean air — try keep 800ppm sure 600ppm ideally.

 incorrect. 

Pfizer &amp; Moderna vaccines shown effective preventing COVID-19 (symptomatic disease), “infection”.

Might seem trivial, using infection &amp; disease interchangeably like Grainger Bona Fide Masks love Actually, what's plausible opposite: eventually flu treated like coronavirus, sense mrna vaccinces already development flu, expected far superior current flu vaccines. Plus would beneficial public health general masking became normal behavior world infectedwith airborne diseases, already Asia.  worth moving progressive area? think might able WFH long term? Many people, including me, planned vacations assumption we'd back kind normal. think could predicted March many idiots would choose remain unvaccinated. Stand up, person told irresponsible recommending N95s KN95s cloth masks “we reserve healthcare workers”.

Not buy Home Depot Lowe’s USA. Health care workers aren’t going big box hardware stores. update April 2020 era guidance. Damn covid-19 keeping people home!! Perhaps time Unionize? Mine moving back office same, even get work home benefit people so.  kill Joffrey, wish had!  easier offshore jobs too. see problem... Don’t forget companies invested millions $ offices stuck them. can’t explain investors need go back offices. fly ointment virus keeps mutating. Plus, another half dozen coronaviruses already known science ready jump animals humans. thing simply going burn own. way deal long run science individual effort. easy way out. South Spain? incredible sure. vape, work remote blood singing nicotine day long. Take maybe one break home make dinner, whereas office waste good hour day smoke breaks. stupid. office encourages one day week office. It’s choice. Eh, love family great relationships them. living home parents, two adult siblings, one young nephew six months straight barely going anywhere outside neighborhood... Well, got old, fast. again, love family. take every opportunity babysit nephew hang everyone. constancy overwhelming ended moving boyfriend, even somewhat rough. Thanks clarifying expounding comment. crappy situation. SmileDirectClub is! Adding analyst roles near future. took week Costco implement mask enforcement rule.

It took Walmart 3 months. FDA children 12, that's why. Parents want know vaccine safe. Effectiveness really secondary point LET'S GUCKING GOOOOOOOOO hospitals become packed mortality rate goes covid every illness. That’s half total deaths 9/11 event  understand mean ""exceed minimums"" -- so, _are_ getting work done, that's somehow enough ?? 

Like, hire contractor replace roof go demand also wash car look busy enough? Or, expect work done time correctly, understand much effort use meaningless... could wave wand sleep 8 hours care. paid job, that's matters... There's value forcing ""busy"" actual work do. 

And that's *absolutely* management problem. Give work enough getting done. minimum enough. Plenty companies successful remote work decade now. can't get work that's problem remote work general. 

Now, maybe talking PR firm, accounting, marketing... know. case, maybe remote great fit. talking tech, absolutely delusional think in-office help real, measurable way. middle management control freaks, nothing more. Good. Less traffic, parents stay home families.... places like USA. Bay Area 80 percent fully vaccinated recall correctly. I'm too. I've fortunate know who've COVID milder cases. personal benefits extra time ... slowing life ... absolutely amazing. Yup same. We're shy hitting new record state right we're back office two days week, coming labor day. reasonable explanation offered despite every sub-executive manager pushing us go back full remote. Mask mandates also reinstated, like they've simply given give shit anymore.

It's really disappointing employer excellent every way stubbornly sticking idiotic position. Yup. algorithm damage. filters people echo chambers. data Delta infect transmitted fully vaccinated. Suppose reinfection possible, year. prevents continual return current case numbers, albeit lower hospitalization death? case, mask mandates rescinded continue like abundance caution case vaccinated &amp; transmission create new variant? unvaccinated poorer nations? It’s big leap get “COVID life forever” conclusion. I'm scared, fully vaccinated. bit 50, one child 19 years fully vaccinated volition. survive continue cheer on? feel defeated sea ignorance. Basically bunch doctors Mayo Clinic discussed latest current state pandemic direction we’re going, it’s basically stuff don’t want hear. There’s post sub.. *nobody panic* 

We fine. We’ve done before. again. areas higher lower across county. neighborhood 60% so.

Here's got numbers:
http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/media/Coronavirus/vaccine/vaccine-dashboard.htm

And here's see city's vaccination rate:
http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/media/Coronavirus/data/reopening-dashboard.htm hear NYC pretty high cost living, may much difference, I'm ignorant that. sales tax Ontario 13% find things generally expensive compare family pays things. isn’t side argument forcing people work way want order suite personal preference?  pretty scary think bad things would get people actually pay attention understand mess in. I’ve seen basically number heating cooling hours pretty predictive spread. 

I mean: people hang inside - either it’s hot shit cold hell outside - covid spreads. (There may little effect virus viability temperature humidity pollutants seems lesser effect)

So FL it’s hot humid summer slightly chilly winter get two peaks like last year. north, it’s mostly winter effect. 

In Hawaii, weather nice year (and high vax rates) pretty low spread overall. 

But honest answer one knows we’re flying blind. 

Make short term decisions based current local spread protect yourself. Yes, actually offered forgot ask. cvs* desperate workers back office purely make easy monitor, regardless productivity.  silver lining pandemic, love working home. work 60 hours week (extra busy due pandemic industry), still prefer 40 hours plus hour commute way (normal area). least I'm getting paid overtime instead sitting car time burning gas. spend time money looking professional office. Going back tough pull swallow. 'dank vape deaths'?? Glad hear let time? I’ll due 8 month booster October, usually get flu shot then, figured I’d plan feel shitty day they’ll let me. soon. didn’t really see last year aid starting run people deciding go back, commercial credits going go bad fast. job harder hey job security higher down

Maybe commercial real estate converted housing. similar me. Covid made lost commute wasted 3 hours daily. also able freelance time savings I've gotten 2 raises since. mean, there's lot positive me, makes feel terrible admit. took extra money bought house room home office. Youll fine let vaxed people attend thanks. I'd like sleep tonight. call outbreak? birthday parties Florida more. keeps wave become norm healthcare staff burn collapse. It’s either government takeover healthcare draft medical workers. We’re already seeing paying nurses isn’t even getting sign up. approve...however people cannot vaccinated,even ifthey want to.
Wouldnt fair already high risks categories. 70% approximate number calculated Alpha herd immunity. Higher infectivity higher immunity needs prevent spread. Cases already peaked states. India, UK, etc huge delta spurts calmed down.

I think might shoot winter like late September October chill.  nickel everyone confuses introversion social awkwardness/anxiety…I’d least dollar. like Plague Inc. finally infect New Zealand numbers barely tick up. submission removed either repost, clickbait low quality submission.

Plus, there’s still possibility long Covid infected.

It's bad thing, important keeping vulnerable people Besides, every country world means store temperature sensitive vaccines.

This oversold problem. vaccines stored styrofoam boxes dry ice. shipped. There's reason--with little bit effort--we can't make work countries. That's June July FWIW.

Forbes [some better this, read full report Health Canada already fully approved  incredibly misinformed people every field. engineers trying build perpetual motion machines, scientists don’t believe evolution, electricians end starting house fires shorty work. medical field exclusion. Doctors don’t believe vaccines, nurses think crystals healing powers. untold thousands nurses employed given time, pre-requisites don’t always demand much critical thinking. totally makes sense would good number nurses subscribe broken logic surrounding vaccines. I'm older I'll probably gone 30-40 years worth something then, good 👍 Approval kids stringent, even emergency approval. hard say good thing need pressing. looking like autumn time. then, best health yours. Confused 2 seconds 86 yo neighbor showed vax papers back January. say Pfizer, say Comirnaty. pretty clearly noted land-borders make situation completely different New Zealand's. really make different, almost spread covid country unrestricted community spread? country could effectively island - would matter guys care prevent deaths. 

Also funny search deep history find play video game sometimes, use attack me. intelligent. lot oldest folks still remember things like Polio rocking rolling, first hand experience seeing wonders working vaccine.  healthy vaccinated 39 yo female- chances getting long covid keep behaving like total covid paranoid crazy lady. Now, data long covid doesn’t happen vaccinated, may go store less N95 lunch friend. info matters.   ""Meh...I WOULD gotten vaccine soon approved think I'm going wait 3+ years data make mind""

\---every non vaxxer planet.  knew wasn’t safe ""it rushed properly test it"" 

Fox News already going angle. course Sunday was, ""If safe, they'd approved now.""  Finland ~12 weeks shots, got second last week  vaccines combined, worldwide, reached 5 billion mark now. safety issues we'd known now

The thing people bring regards long term side effects. worry vaccine randomly kill 10 years line, say get another 10 years safe. I'm sure we'll see people talking nonsense I’m sorry, I’m US
I wondering could kindly explain comment? :/   hang mass quarantine center 2 weeks. aweful that?  ""And never random testing idea much asymptomatic transmission took place"". Probably. Sorry, can't come today boss. Last Natty left bedridden, may 2 day thing, I'll keep updated. Tell 30 year old road died past weekend. heavier side 225-250. New wife newborn daughter. Unvaccinated, course. Nope. make seem like avoiding infection bad thing. Plus, there’s still possibility long Covid infected.

Besides, every country world means store temperature sensitive vaccines.  Comorbid, birth girth, totally natty:

Comirnaty got DoubleSpikeVaxxed car park. disagree morally speaking answer clearly ""NO"". think protect whole world would amazing many countries starting catch up. meantime though data suggests vaccine's ability protect decreasing morally obligated nation protect people again? Many people healthcare workers seniors received first doses . protection wavering risk protect booster? much morally wrong allow neighbors community members die, countries gotten vaccinated yet? actually wait little wanted things thought about.  Aside age getting want kids relatively close age.  also feel next wave area early pregnancy late stages (spring early summer) lull lot community immunity area.  think we’ve thought lot responsible decisions be. I'm DoD contractor there's vaccine mandate dozens bases I've past couple months. print shop work mine. figured would like WW2 draft card something people would interested one day. kids Id take anything make sure die leave fatherless. 

There's probably like... least 10 different bottles things house make happen!

But I'm guessing meant ""make sure ***don't*** die"". Somebody must said exact phrase Fox News something recently. I’ve seen 10+ people say “would rather die free man” get vaccine week alone.  That’s long winded way say immense privilege afforded luxury perceived immunity things like famine, disease, hunger, etc.

There billions third world would love take vaccine dose, people can’t even paid take it. 

Don’t make excuses them. far tell, there’s info 6 vs 8 months. know effectiveness wane 6 months though, want safe, it’s probably best get booster now. great news, I’m glad vaccines making huge positive impact best part people scream loudest communist everything people getting bailed unnecessary medical bills due covid.

That said, see realistic way could deny coverage - there's much collateral damage people (like kids spouses) maybe get vaccinated anything wrong.

I sure wish antivax crowd would become self aware, though. always read Modern-a Vaccination would help people dying, whack take lol. Lol infinity covid approach hospitals full poison hotline overwhelmed people using animal medication.  Well lets agree extreme completely good. really super simple. Compare like like. Compare severe disease 60 year old vaccinated 60 year old unvaccinated, 30 year old vaccinated.

What's really illustrative severe disease rate 50+ vaccinated vs 50 unvaccinated. virtually identical. severe disease rate 50+ unvaccinated 10 times higher 50 unvaccinated. Thank getting it. Fox News announced vaccine approval saying rushed (in usual ""just asking questions"" way). There's cure uneducated. Thank goodness mandates coming. much? fancy P100 respirator costs $35 overall. expensive-ish also reusable quite time.  somehow worst best job server. hope never again, nice reliable fall back resume. said, everything bad restaurant jobs I'd imagine would million times worse covid. Glad got things got bad Including pretty good social programs so? spouse kids home? co-workers rich home office? Federal Conservatives seem laying much moderate left leaning policies UCP worth vaccinate Covid-19 choice Sinovac?

Asking friends stuck Myanmar, military coup all. Currently, choice accessible vaccine Sinovac Chinese variants. 

Would better wait reputable vaccine? end getting Sinovac, still go another vaccine becomes available? surprised. work home (and past 6 years) would love common everyone. I’m able much better balance working home. 

The kids home past 18 months increased stress though. think introvert alone time powers me. I’ve none since 2020. I’m really hoping person school I’m nervous wreck (one kids immunocompromised) You’re obtuse. I'm 15% it. I'm slow reader might take year finish lol. worth it? perspective coming all. Nothing wrong trying objective crazies sides debate getting headlines. company closed offices except half one people still prefer coming time time. let those, can't punish women sin sex without husband first! I’ve working education decade. schools never nurse. First thing go 2008 recession gutted education budgets never bothered restore it. Aw disagree that. Bellingham beautiful full kind, community oriented people. crusty hippies rest western Washington also lot positives found here. hate toward you, I’m sorry experience wasn’t great. ever come back beers 🍻 rate also flat Wow industry this?  That’s level knowledge. irony comment overwhelming. forgot: massive benefit pollution climate change needing travel another desk. response question three different ways reduce *your* risk getting Covid:

1. Reduce chance interacting someone Covid: breakthrough cases vaccinated people less likely, hang around people vaccinated, less likely run someone Covid first place.
2. Reduce infectiousness someone interact Covid: jury still whether vaccine reduces vaccinated person COVIDs infectiousness. Worst case anyone COVID level highly contagious, vaccines may help here.
3. Reduce likelihood catching Covid you’re exposed it: you’re vaccinated you’re far less likely catch Covid you’ve exposed it.

As say - 2 outa 3 ain’t bad. I’d also like know long New Zealand plans keep up. Covid going away flu point. There’s bound continuous introductions long they’re letting travelers in.  company. moved across country. Engineered WFH forever it’s good thing them, too. Otherwise would’ve quit 😌 one cared put mask

-Bane

-Michael Scott host sounds like character early 2000s comedy haha.

There's episode nytimes podcast daily covers restaurant industry Covid. really eye-opening. Though hard understand mindset NZ countries covid effectively endemic, one case unknown source almost always means one actual case. think public NZ understands pretty well   wonder would reduce amount unruly passengers….. GOOD Make stand, never another opportunity raise wages keep people home work home. Pressure state national leaders put protection place, enforce current better wages. It’s useless middle managers suddenly prove worth worried. Yea mine either 7-5 8-6 often times eating lunch desk. Plus 45 minutes commute way. need new job.  spreads 10 days symptoms. It'll spread anyone even knows exists. know certain. know hated job. might less anti vax fucked make trip walmart day job hated. idk know well.

Restaurants crazy people leave suddenly weird reason frequently. manager walk mid-dinner rush quit become full time twitch streamer. saw server get fired coke bathroom. saw host get fired throwing crayons guests thought looked ""too rich good."" 

So, idk server anti-vax lazy coincidence. word among staff fired missed deadline get shot. missed deadline idk countless people died covid saved bucks gas guess good Oh man... I'm fully vaccinated too. shortness breath? Oh god. hoped get symptom. Wondering severe breakthrough vaccinated comorbidities think hospitals give non-vaxed people arrive ER complimentary freedum hat, chloroquine, regeneron send home deal consequences inaction.  Sewer system!? What's next, prophylactics!? need feel miserable slave away life working meagre pay. /s talkin Imagine unlocked proximity. Imagine spend hundreds hours people thousands dollars year getting jobs accounts we've able quite well remotely past year. Imagine able work Montana Colorado support company San Francisco New York. Companies always crying cutting costs, imagine able pay good wage Michigan rather decent one New York, sides happy. Imagine saving money massive floor space downtown going remotely. 

We're discovering many jobs done without office. We're discovering as, productive commute hour way, wages eaten transportation costs buy expensive house cuts commute. could brave new world, profitable employers employees, held hostage micro-managers people trying justify constant oversight. 7 day average 150k per day, roughly double wrote comment still rising x I'm 95% sure breakthrough. I'm fully vaxxed (Pfizer April) I've crazy careful way pandemic. Last weekend July went outdoor wedding people supposed verify vaxxed. Entire day outdoors folks moved (unmasked) indoor bar 2 hours continue party. may downfall.

Last week sore throat body aches TERRIBLE. could barely move without extreme pain. beyond fatigued. Like, sit desk without wanting fall asleep sitting up. Three days later, over. Body aches gone like lightswitch flipped. Crazy. test scheduled, things ramping due Delta, able get symptoms gone. And, due work schedule, cancel test scheduled never know. certainly felt like nothing I've ever experienced before. 

Mostly, I'm pissed careful way got careless. moment work home announced made personal mission prove productivity gain work. goal build trust needed forever flexibility.

However, one guy team made mission show needs constant babysitting. He's screwing everyone. Since I'm one getting shit done I'm asked back office look shoulder day.

I know last year, earned 100k jerk play videogames probably.I'm sure he's thinking. One look git history places would've fired hand. infuriating bullshit screwing plan.

Regardless, mystery he's dud, already assurances dictate schedule, even relocate... unheard two years ago. I'm looking forward going back office dude's gatekeeper. point treat similar way sufficient numbers vaccinated. nolonger drastically different.

You less likely become infectious, infectious shorter period. much less likely require hospitalisation. IMO point comparison flu valid.

NZ going keep lockdown cycle ongoing years. Compliance get harder hard time. Kids vaccinated. every one regardless age get vaccinated able get fully vaccinated - that’s end game. it’s waiting game unvaccinated get develop level immunity. die.  Grocery stores essential tho lol think people stay fuck home they’re going hungry. Also adding this, numbers inside grocery stores limited follow process one one in. still Anglican? think factors positions Covid measurements? false algorithm positivity constant. Flat cases rising positivity indicates infection growth misrepresented case counts.

It's also incorrect look nationwide. part country completely different curve now. Many places certainly downswing. Others rising exponentially, others flat, others look flat testing enough. girlfriend back office whole month sent back home. try avoid future. that’s possible. many alt accounts use? one? Queensland, Victoria, WA South Australia stopped Delta outbreaks. none close big Auckland outbreak appears be. largest Oz Indooroopily Cluster Queensland, nearly 150 cases, took 3 weeks grow size. Obviously NSW Vic much bigger outbreaks, I'm talking ones successfully crushed. 

The Auckland Cluster R-rate 6, growing 107 cases 6 days. bigger outbreak anyone China crushed far. table somewhere showing country's adult vaccinated percentages? don’t want infected matter mild symptoms may be. one don’t want risk developing long covid symptoms, two don’t want potentially expose young kid can’t get vaccinated yet. sure hope so! Getting rid commute massively improved mood. Can't go Talladega mass venue unless vaccinated. wouldn't. mean maybe pandemic guess conspiracy theories... 

But let's say deadlier transmissive. China would realize insane shit happened whole world woulda shut literally asap. Even Trump. 

The dead bodies would create mass hysteria. mutation outside spike matter? Middle management CEOs love offices perks good share family. places around converted big chunks business catering/delivery. make food huge batches get picked various food delivery service. Worked pretty well, favorite restaurants definitely getting ton business Yea arough flu season. I've full time remote 14 years I've always told upper management remote workers would see productivity sky rocket. exactly happened last year. Everyone accessible projects finishing ahead time. corporate back 100% back work productivity come halt. Projects going past deadlines moral time low. know corporations insist archaic work model. Catholic church knows secure future profits. It’s evangelicals US I’m worried about. 

But that’s point. churches obviously can’t trusted world population’s interest mind. (tax free) corporations concerned profits. 

The governments world need act independently end situation. take mandatory vaccinations, exceptions, religious otherwise. remember one person's excuse was? sound like Typhoid Mary. genuinely think needing full lockdown every time small clusters pop next months sustainable pursuing goal rapidly procuring vaccinating population? strategy worked well 2020, already August 2021 still needing full lockdown reflects poor vaccination procurement plan, especially given NZ actually unable afford vaccines.

The COVID zero strategy viable given infectious Delta is. Even health minister acknowledged relied strict border controls backed hard lockdowns cases slip through, Hipkins said Delta may force like nothing we've dealt pandemic,"" change everything, means existing preparations begin look less adequate raises pretty big questions future long-term plans."" clinical trials tens thousand people course months. new variants millions people course 9 months. absolutely correct! important factor. example, coronaviruses lots mechanisms immune evasion unrelated spike protein Good person get tested.

Yes, masks back places, even places social distancing, schools open, etc. hopeful Covid viruses want evolve less deadly, doubt mind that, regardless case numbers, government mask mandates last max one year. Moderna pfizer vaccines shown multiple real-world data effective preventing wildtype alpha infection. right trials based symptomatic COVID, incorrect therefore believe that's thing know vaccines.

Yeah, wait times absurd. broke arm waited 8 hours ER get x-ray cast. There's reasons that. 1) city I'm in, one hospital 600,000 people. 2) since free, there's lot people go ER non emergencies. There's pros cons everything guess. hospitals also nice lot hospitals I've seen US. believe get here: OK, see short reaction looks awfully suspect, I'm talking demonstrated lower efficacy mRNA vaccines United States Delta gained strong foothold. denying important are. contesting point, either, is, course, here's one 25,000 people living United States vaccinated cohort. Pfizer July 2021 42% effective symptomatic infection Covid.

That's I'm saying. News outlets keep telling vaccinated people they're 80-90% protected symptomatic Delta infection. realistic, worry creates situations someone might, say, wear mask store decide to. Tangential reaction sad article. prosecute someone fullest extent law, first must identify law person broken. Imagine CMBS defaults. did, prevention strategies still work.

Many survived permanently disabled lung organ damage. Getting infected safe way create immunity. fully vaccinated is. think big thing nobody touching sick days people taking. matter there's slight drop single day productivity employees take 5+ fewer days sick leave. Yet infection rate still rising. population less five millions, reaching daily rate 1500. Really know going get many years. say sarcastically, going huge problem, likely next 2008. commercial landlord huge loans.

One year two... proof.

If company demands office work, a) pey xommute time (door door) b) count carbon emissions commute offset them. think like 4 cases MERS U.S. sure get far. Say personal opinions role market based economy. I've double vaxxed mid-june (pfizer)

I STILL MASKED 100% TIME EVEN THOUGH VACCINATED CONTINUE SO!!!

Recently caught delta variant assume.... (Doc told going run lab tests since double vaxxed).

He told breakthrough case, happens. Might delta, might not. told part masking getting jabs vaccine asshole still got infected.

Spent 1 day hospital OK'd head home... currently recovering still. (This happened 2 weeks ago).

Fuck anti-maskers, i've fever/shortness breath 2 weeks finally starting get control. GET VACCINATED PEOPLE!!!! send feelers haven’t already. You’d surprised what’s  Yes Victoria lost control current outbreak, crushed previous one week earlier. said hope new cases may seeded constantly NSW border, crush one cluster another emerge. NZ still able secure borders, still hope. companies also smaller pool employees (secretaries, custodial, entry level jobs). That’s part reason larger companies haven’t pushed return, overhead saving.

CDC presentation days booster shots announced everyone US discussed this. Apparently 6 months Moderna’s protections infection drop 86% 76%. Pfizer drops 75% 42%. information comes one study done Mayo clinic, maybe others find different results. Seriously, hate driving. costs lot gas, time, stress. commute amazing. noticed failed reply perfectly valid proposition virus may mutate benign form interest. main problem see is, virus one mutation time, many simultaneously. benign versions, fact already (at least four common cold pathogens closely related coronaviruses) benign versions mechanism displacing deadly ones, still around. Also, hard imagine benign version virus, destroying host cell built replication mechanism. Luckily stayed home soon got back since became sick trip appear spread anyone knows of.



Good him. Fucking hate people still go school work show dedicated get people sick. “rare” seem know read lot people breakthrough infections I'm Alabama.

My mother take treat liquid oxygen breathing hot air greenhouse catches virus. brother ex-military said he's done experimented on. dad seems fence depending upon whether he's drinking not. watch news he's probably influenced anti-vax rednecks.

Me, husband, young adult kids literally went Wal-Marts nearby took shots people show appointments could get ASAP.

We're process moving us kids safer location, parents brother probably going die. feelings it, we've tried talk sense since started. worked. give up. nothing else do. Sure, working somewhere like call center. However, working high skilled job, chances can't easily outsource another developing country region. Otherwise begin with, even people working person office? Yea study they're saying they're measuring. sounded sure study meant. ""Conservatives""? live UK mate, try drag American psychosis. anyone disagreeing people either labelled ""conservative"" ""liberal"" simply due disagreement?

You say ""thems facts"" constantly appeal authority, though claiming scientist reddit backs assertions. simple ""doing NZ"", everywhere would done that, clearly simple. Complex geopolitics, trade, geography, movement people, many factors played NZ able achieve something major western nations could not. authoritatively claim otherwise arrogant accused being. ""17x likely"" is, uh, 1700% yet annoying wrinkle every legal department everywhere gonna see real soon New Zealanders owe damn thing? percentage New Zealanders vaccinated?  Anyone else who's older software developer noticed WFH suddenly seems increased number job offers floating past?

I've software developer 35 years, started consultancy 20 ago could work home, juggle life better (young kids time) live somewhere wanted to. Pandemic WFH made much difference - rest world catching :-)

Solid client base issues needing work, I've always kept CV sitting LinkedIn like. 50 fit profile young hip software developer got pinged time time offers, often

Last year though dramatically increased. may market one periodic software skills shortages, can't help get feeling WFH age simply consideration used be.  There's need concerned developer hire fitting office environment office environment. big problem massive protests happening every weeks creating massive spreading events among people refuse tested.

As Victorian, cases NSW, engagement party American style conservative, anti-vax protests going keep state shut months end.

You convince gov lift lockdown making lockdown important. would bosses worry people coming back offices? better especially since I'm pretty sure saw report businesses saw increase work productivity since working remotely thing. hope people keep mind that: remote work, comes remote labor possibilities. 

All people US Western Europe excited working home, dreaming blissfully sipping coffee home desk without dealing traffic, supervisors annoying colleagues bother them, forgetting employers converted job done remotely able hire lower salaried employees live across country cheaper regions, also hire people anywhere World half salary less job place.

And think means customer support India. mean hiring Canadians still living Canada happy accept 60-70% US salaries, British people living Thailand Pattaya Beach happy accept 50% European salaries, perfect English speaking computer capable Filipinos working home town accept 25% salary. 

You longer competing talent within 10 miles office, competing people anywhere World internet connection. Rip apple spaceship campus many vaccinated New Zealand? Less road accidents! Hire me. He's mafioso pay keep utilities running can't live yet, yet within sight able live it, must try lot harder suffer inconvenience. page?

First, vaccines incredibly effective, even versus delta - however need subtle management get work best (the UK, much europe canada seemed informed us front.

&amp;#x200B;

The bit quoted - think important questions post leeds to.

What ""we cant live it""? 

I mean 99.9% us will, literal, mean continued various controls? look like long?

Which leads next question - people care comply, long think behaviour follow new rules? Lmfao someone lives Tri Cities listen wanna rednecks faux twang accents, agree more. Pretty sure caught mine busy bar / restaurant obviously maskless lot time. Everywhere else I've masked. don’t put restrictions/mandatory guidelines/lockdown ever number need hit vaccinations.

Because never hit number. would permanent restrictions. I’m sure know that. 

It would nice kind plan (feels like zero leadership covid right now) ain’t that. see there...and love it! Double vax AstraZeneca breakthrough case. Really mild headache 2 days feeling rundown, fever, felt pretty much ok day 3 100% day 4 lost smell day 5.  lot really important things yet happen. Hold horses.

Full FDA approval yet happen, vaccination age 12.  people like bad news. got upvote always bullshit though. needed 70% _immunity_ stop alpha. vaccine thats 80% effective preventing infection proportion x vaccinated, spread 0.2 * x + (1-x).

To get 70% immunity we'd need 87.5% vaccination coverage. anyone links earliest human clinical trials mRNA vaccine technology? mum keeps bringing ""can't know long term side effects"" honestly can't think good response.

Was work done producing vaccines pre-COVID? know ran short term safety issues regarding liver toxicity animals, cannot life find human trials 2020 ones, accept long enough ago proof. thought BBQ man delta around possible faced once. Depends mean working. aim seems shifting keeping fire smoulder till vaccine effect kicks in. Plus numbers Vic skewed Melbourne outbreak numbers look bigger since second outbreak Shepparton joined party two months I'm moving 1,500 miles away office. I'm never going back. long lol Well I'm offended - born end boomer start genX (depending definition) software developer I've working home 25 years - actually started company could so. difference pandemic made spend day half week going see clients, teams.

Glad see rest world catching up. NZ also covering salaries people unable work home lockdown. imagine poorer countries like India USA unable that.  still waiting appointment Madrid. Registered told do. friends situation. thinking might easier fly home Germany get shot.

The Spanish system great anyone system. international student similar it’s hard get shot.

They need go away big vaccination Center model well. Centers either require car Long ride public transit. Make easier people get vaccinated.

Also get live. know everyone travels August. let people get shot ever holiday? Uh, no. Regeneron EUA, think need sub ivermetin maybe cleaning products. Hard find non-chinese link (and one available overseas), 
But think folks least seem keep updated reported mainland Austrailan state gotten delta back zero except NSW

Didnt NSW first delta case spread household member?  BBQ galore guy - forget mention one?

&amp;#x200B;

The difference NSW chief medical officer control like states

and last year lamenting Vict's CHO real power either, sits lower hierachy NSW, wasnt invited take charge - things endlee - look WA CHO - never see - people seem believe premier completely running show there.

Pointedly, idea come recently, gven would case last year, speaks political issue - Brett Sutton - came light things going shit.

 asking coming now, Brett Suttons diffciulties premier disapeared. statistics used influence decision. could make argument small amount people died vaccine, since either 0 100% well. Yet much could company save got rid building lease building. realise 21 cases 0. 

Don't get wrong, China's best compared country covid. think 'over' get complacent.

But even without reporting cases, country still dealing Delta since they've quarantined whole bunch folks Shanghai airport. People affected. 

Even cases atm seem imported cases, nature delta variant means every country still needs dealing (as else get NZ creeps in)  remember that, supposedly causing similar issues didn’t know COVID time. Makes ya wonder. Like lol  us, went back plan september ""2022"" time provincial Prime Minister became cautious infections...

I lucked think. doesn’t work?

You simply can’t completely ignore behaviour non-insignificant portion population. It’s like economists assume humans rational. many cases might true, create theories policies nonsense. also know someone got second shot month two ago positive month.. hell point going office point sunk cost commercial real estate? Corporate fucking prison — let people work home, infinitely productive forcing adults sit uninspiring space pretending busy still waiting appointment Madrid. something add up.

The system seam work people part national healthcare system. several friends position. registered phone told do. called second time find what’s going told us wait.

There large number immigrants situation. Many international students example. allow us phone mandatory meetings hospital - absolutely fucking awesome.

I hope never changes. disagree. feel like large reason people take vaccine involves understanding statistics, constantly told ""the numbers show works"" without explanation. personally know someone taking vaccine belief lack effectiveness. feel like regarded anything new, rather explanation 94% efficacy means. No, certainly showing. fact, know opposite true, specifically said vaccination. guess NZ lock control again, even infectious... methods work Delta variant, replicates faster... spread vaccinated - break cases rare. Somehow extremely rare cases break exaggerated point people acting like spreads vaccinated people, something like 99% new cases unvaccinated people getting unvaccinated people. vaccinated right now, it'd essentially with. could've now, that's insane part all.

Zero covid realistic now, people, politics, stupidity. cooperated, literally could 0 months.... like could control world like video game, it'd pretty much reduced 0 months, masks vaccines. half population vaccinated right things, ""over it"", fooked. It'll spread mutate further, likely get spike protein mutation point may need new vaccines. believe still could possibly time escape path, variant yet detected. Every mainland Austrailan state gotten delta back zero except NSW. Even Vic NSW reinfected them.

The difference NSW chief medical officer control like states, conservatives played politics. Gladys even told people want cancel social events gatherings, right first big super spreader party. Yeah, there's really reason people pay attention stuff point. Gotta wait see. 100% right.  isn’t anyone county getting vaccinated afraid getting sick able pay healthcare bills.   


What absurd thought. living pay check pay check, can’t afford hospitalized let alone miss day work, nothing like exists United States.  mean it’s like medical expenses #1 reason people file bankruptcy.    


The thought completely ridiculous, like people taking veterinary drugs treat prevent covid. That's extremely good interesting point. grew working class environment English midlands, coal miners, builders factory workers immediate family - 50 years ago. majority men avid gardeners either reasonable sized gardens houses allotments. kept pigeons keen fishermen. 8 hour day plus hour overtime common, lived short bicycle car ride place work net leisure time must least couple hours day, maybe more.

Long commuting times definitely lost whole culture. going back. something market sort out. People want work home know possible. Jobs offer work home people work elsewhere. CEOs job outsourced too. It’s slippery slope alright. suspect reasons office jobs haven’t already outsourced reason execs haven’t sent jobs overseas phenomenon trickle up.


Where stop? you’ve sent remote management, mid management, upper management jobs India 10% labor cost, add company bottom line please investors?


Next year they’re going look job. shareholders vote Indian CEO…. Indian person replace lawyers exec positions third cost, 7x work….? 


It’s going trickle Start looking another job place flexible company goes bust it.  premier NSW specifically mocking states went lockdown days outbreak encouraging people cancel social events big gatherings. days later huge super spreader party event, everything snowballed there.

All mainland states gotten delta back zero actually going hard early, new game, NSW's leadership typical conservatives can't handle reality hard needing listen scientists tried mock play chicken reality make go away.

Worse, states like Queensland beaten delta even know outbreaks came from, still beat finding well way. NSW first case fucked up. they're pass thousand new cases day getting worse. Yes, assuming better treatments, improved vaccines improved hygene including masking appropriate, live it. things happened yet extent would required, can't live yet, yet within sight able live it, must try lot harder suffer inconvenience. page? I'm U.S. (i live South America), December 2019 awful flu-like illness , right another one (milder) 2 3 weeks before. almost coughing lungs remember. caught attention time short period 2 events. time beginning hear news Wuhan, virus officially circulating here.

I know unlikely, can't help think could it. Even time used visit WeWork building often, lots foreigners visiting place time.   Seen people catch nasty bout Covid UK within week 2 single dose. high places (looking USA) exist. think outbreak scared bajeezuz people hesitant against, rates gone heaps last week. favourite Chinese takeaway built floor ceiling wall plastic small door food noticable positive pressure coming back house held open door let one door dash driver time.

I think risk *low*. People willing quit jobs refuse WFH lesser pay. can't administer vaccines dead. feeling username would trigger them. general, careful ""information"" Iranian opposition. BBC's analysis shows 200k death compared usual number pre-covid. Iran officials say official number 100k really half actual deaths, consistent BBC's analysis. Especially us last year, got vaccinated, caught super mild case months later.

Part problem, suspect, everyone antibodies. world unfortunately now, yeah they've coming holes attack year large companies built in-office work, probably set old ways, would difficult change. there's one thing latest news (both NZ delta spreads vaccinated) showing us yes: going spread anyway.

Zero covid realistic timeline longer months. Whats vaccine hesitancy situation look like there? They're going stop it, vaccinating reduce eventual carnage significantly. positive indicator. US net exporter gas worked home year. decided go back July. got new remote job month later. asked quitting said want work remote. Manager replies….oh ya…we’re set that. Wtf!! worked home year NP! dumb think am? Jeez glad working home. Brisbane Australia also beat Delta outbreak. Peaked 200 cases.

And within 8 day lockdown. NZ Vaccination. one point companies realize much save people realize work home affects social component work.

And tables turn. subreddit appears infested raging anti-lockdown activists. well, guess finally found way kill batman Sorry, edge comment trail person said “fuck people” like want work site. discount snowbirds, either; I'm sure bunch people got first shot February Florida, second shot home state later on. would nice, theres still jobs require hands work, like lab work biotech, service industry. benefits people whos job uses online services business. Anything programming related easy answer.   Shut lady. There's freshmen team separate JV? interesting tell us data can’t: Vaccinated people appear getting coronavirus surprisingly high rate.

What this? Lmfao. can’t even take seriously. One thing keep mind already lot workplaces are, - big suburban office parks city far amenities residential homes are. 

I think still many people willing leave house go get lunch delivered many workers office parks (or pandemic). I’d even wager may become appealing WFH case provides nice break day see around people. I'm UK winter 2021 

Are future? bosses /r/boomersbeingfools They've year looks like another way.... many offices still paying rent moratorium extend them? again, I'm sure offices trying get people back justify expense rather adjusting future years rent damn office.  Agree too. I'm Senior Executive fed we've remote working time works fine. Sure, folks chase hold accountable, part, stronger ability recruit retain wider pool qualified candidates. managers want return offices. would say like H&amp;M homewares section. business owner, would rather relocate one best state economies nation there's requirement wear masks indoors? lol so-called Delta 'sub-variants' tested convalescent plasma/serum, demonstrate they're contagious deadlier (highly unlikely), absolutely nothing here. sure much SPIKE even mutate that's advantageous virus itself. SPIKE changes much diminishing ability even bind ACE2 cell entry replication. Click-baiter... Something something free market something...  Creative destruction.  I'm following line cloth mask full NASA space suit. would get looks! someone hired new company Feb 2020 left meeting anyone person. lack human contact able learn things people in-office biggest reason.

I left another company last October that’s in-office almost every new hire says “in-office experience” biggest reason joining.

Seems like everyone forgets hard form relationships truly learn ins outs respective companies without office. 

I’m wfh, think whole thread circlejerk. Yep want control “up 6 days remote” take. Someone team wanted week month home instead say mondays 2 tuesdays cfo pissed said wasn’t spirit policy. post made realize love combination words, ""worrying bosses."" think orgasmed  Also, don’t think know .01% number correct regards Delta. haven’t seen IFR numbers published specific Delta variant. know, 2 weeks ago. Now, hospitalizations Washington HIGHEST they've entirety pandemic, many ICUs near at-capacity. essentially back pre-pandemic normal July, yet Delta legitimately changed things trajectory over-run hospitals see many fully-vaxxed breakthrough cases properly treat. seems completely reasonable institute something simple mask wearing indoor locations. 

I'm performing musician huge fan live music, (and still am) ready get back normalcy much anyone. think shackled anxiety cater anti-vaxxers fucking recovery. current surge seems call bit action, however. Totally within right company mandate health practices employees. Noone forcing work there. sympathize. recently went friend mine. Fortunately, really one person care life like this. frustrating. want accepting tolerant, couldn’t. Ultimately let know made uncomfortable around them. city, slowly businesses requiring vaccine. I’m delighted say, finally gave got shot. hope friend comes around. already aren’t going back.  interviewed tech company recently said publicly it’ll remote permanently. bs. 

first round interview asked position requires office, recruiter said it’s hiring manager going second round bring up. second round asked hiring manager wtf told wants people seats bc leads better “teamwork”. gtfo. 

i got email want go onto round 3, asked recruiter please withdrawn application. 

it’s go back office, it’s everything type manager i’d reporting either lack trust new people need “prove” work home they’ve office 30+ years expect others too. Lol big time lie first time around, hope people people buy nonsense expect again. Micromanaging mid level management going roll accept great resignation narrative meme.

I'm happy work home hope long doubts soon ok shovel us back office  Everything propagandized days. executives extroverts. Love around people. workers introverted side. Also executives afford short commutes often people handle kids work etc. know antibody treatment someone sick. See Trump. Maybe business asking *why* want back, work done home people enjoy better way.

OTOH, guess middle managers find really hard bully micromanage people online..

PAPR okay covid need filter covid otherwise perfectly fine air. I'm convinced half middle- upper-management work like personalities disposed work like that. know culture working time exists sure engender culture, there's got rise based simply desire separate life work.

Unfortunately still push everyone else work like without commensurate pay. lot people work work home. leave 5 take care kids ends leave 5. one thing done. would imagine people work home huge benefit companies. would explain low level transmission. RN's, LPN's, NP's. Biggest difference highlighted numbers - what: nurses/doctors 20 1? People half time ""think"" saw doctor saw NP. ""my doctor said vaccines nonsense"" holds true really understand difference.

Also, half family medicine/are RN's either BSN's MSN's. So, ""minimum requirement"" ""what people hold"" mileage may vary. Franklin. Thinking moving Fayette, though. Maybe Louisville. trade dense population (no pun intended)/science-minded population. dont many fat people I've never worked home. Kind jealous office workers.  Shit delta right Galveston TX?!   Sad world would it? seems gauche dine hospitals diverting oxygen water plant. 

Maybe instead banging pots pans VACCINE PASSPORTS could've trivialized virus. here's really twisted part Murdoch. creates anti-vaxxers via Fox News Wall Street journal, reports sell newspapers. hell he'd going contributed negativity towards vaccines making lot money reporting sensationalizing it. he's reporting reality it'll sell papers. dick. line work saw big spike domestics, child abuse cases overdoses. appears lot people handle families small doses. company survey remote workers 90% people said wanted continue work home. last meeting manager still saying keep open mind covid calms down.   Middle managers everywhere explain existence.

A whole section workforce useless. I'm sure people think ""0.01% chance hospitalization"" means. let rip population, people gonna get really sick.

Luckily, cut drastically vaccines.  much less greenhouse gas, don’t waste money eating days people generally productive. pleasantly surprised employer this. many offices metro, started selling bunch them. boss told team going full remote, approved work wherever want.

There lot people saying wanted go back office, I'm glad employer bend them. lot older execs wanting us back office. agree remote work great (I set alarm anymore! kids wake anyway, even earlier alarm, least rush commute!), longer term financial implications.

A lot pension funds investments real estate. idea rents always going go up, pension fund grows.

But businesses go of, well, business, city centres empty, property vacant.
So rent, smaller pension fund long term. expect order last long time. It’s part containment measure pressure unvaccinated get vaccinated. fact game changed vaccine came out. issue last year compleltey novel virus immunity, 2021, population thats large immune population completley vunerable. Surprise surprise vunerable population fell victim another wave covid thats US mess right now. studies inhalation, they're work safety focused. think many exhalation capture. inhalation effectiveness N95s well established decades. Sorry mate, sloshed. apologize! ""All silly epidemiology always identifying ways conditions allow diseases spread. downhill since closed cholera well."" -- bosses, probably Im sure hospitals find looking medical history. regular doctor give doctor's note explaining cant get vaccinated. Mayo Clinic released study included looking *just* July Minnesota, throughout delta made 75% cases. showed kind numbers got Israel moving boosters.

Month July, symptomatic: Pfizer 42% (95% CI: 13-62%), Moderna 76% (95% CI: 58-87%)

Month July, hospitalization: Pfizer 75% (95% CI: 24-93.9%), Moderna 81% (95% CI: 33-96.3%)

Those wide confidence intervals, even upper ends good. we'd done civic duty cases--actually staying masking getting vaccine soon could--we'd able get back semblance normal.

Definitely problem perfect solution; but, least said vaccinated unvaccinated folks alike, theoretically basis comparison hospitalizations deaths vaccinated unvaccinated still holds true.As far what's 'beneficial' government, would probably rather accurate numbers, I'm sure best ability- probably leaves lot desired, (at least federal level) deliberately fudging numbers. report emphasize, spin comes IMO - CDC ostensibly marketing organization. Mercy Comfort designed mass casualty events, especially wartime evacuations. Think three beds top other, like boot camp racks, that’s wards ships. ward areas also isolated rest ship. That’s ideal COVID situation. Also, it’s civilian-run merchant marines, ship crews civilian run engineering non-medical military support like cooks, admin, clerks consists 30% ship’s complement. Comfort went NYC totally thinking would take non-COVID cases ease burden hospitals, ended taking COVID cases. erect barriers living spaces ward spaces plastic 2x4s. people who’ve never military ships’ horror, there’s Wi-Fi cellphone signal onboard. people battling disease dying alone imagine first world scenario. Overall, nobody wants repeat huge strain resources (those personnel already serving healthcare capacity doctors, nurses, corpsman military hospitals) accomplished little. deploy ships scheduled rotation, siphon manpower wherever instead “surge” demands programmed rotation. Think 9/11 NYC constrained resources, Comfort largely effective even unscheduled “surge” since part country needed response. Further, COVID, personnel undergo quarantine testing got back return units, time away primary jobs leaving hospitals already undermanned.

Not sure people think spare military people lying around events. Even whole Afghanistan Iraq campaign, Army “borrow” personnel Navy Air Force staff bases, program still going today (it’s called Individual Augmentee Navy used shove people hard-to-fill spots).

My point Florida protections place fact opposite encourage infection rather limiting it. cases equate major hospitalizations, matter? know would agree that. mean guess kind of. years homeschooling kinda like that. also hybrid approach.

Children ages 12 19 leading age groups Florida rate test positive COVID-19 — sobering data point comes Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) fights tooth nail school mask age group tested positivity rate 25 percent, per Tampa Bay Times. kids 12 younger rate 23 percent.

With positivity rates high, guess many cases missed. highest rates I’ve ever seen.  people probably thought thing smallpox anti vaxxers  scrutiny insurance companies prescribe. award prescribing generic brands. huge asshole making decision unvaccinated point. Big time.  major vaccines FDA approval, make vaccinations mandatory.  sample size little 100. I'm convinced.   Sadly family (most likely) hasn’t vaccinated ones get Tucker Carlson Matt gaetz slash fanfiction

I doubt fda mean anything them.  always called like actually. received it, written vaccination papers next Pfizer. Oh like it, brag vaccine cooler name. According Madonna, So, what’s gonna new excuse anti-vax people always say “I’m waiting approved FDA”. breakthroughs thing, maybe big babies still afraid shots come another excuse oral version finalized.  right, COVID never go away. like Flu, Polio, etc. guess able overcome those?  hell even prononce that? possible long term effects

What long term effects? I'd rather stick proven technology

So far ""causal link"" covid vaccine side effects J&amp;J vaccine, uses traditional ""proven"" method involves injecting modified actual virus body. help - friend wife, 70s, J&amp;J several months ago. minor (fever, fatigue) side effects fine. breakfast friend days ago, wife great. Wonder August numbers would since curve really started grow mid-July
A lot people justify UK’s approach since deaths fraction before, don’t see many people reasoning deaths actually acceptable level [Bring Swedish   Gotta keep crotch demon safe Hot take - one wants sneeze themself. Can’t believe even needs said. absolutely agree. Even school district doesn’t require fully vaccinated quarantine test return school direct household exposure. require keep student home awaiting test. discourages testing think. purely anecdotal currently dealing two breakthrough cases home. fully Pfizer vaccinated March. husband sick enough steroid antibody treatment. I’m much mild started runny nose, lost smell, cough. Four days later occasional cough extreme fatigue. infection week older point recovery. difference husband exposure would call mini super spreader. family vacation house 20 half unvaccinated four days. 11 cases house / one hospitalized. feel like must something viral load prolonged exposure many got sick sick even vaccinated house. symptoms mild case house. Incubation one week me- keep testing kids everyone still negative. AMA :/    know plenty nurses refused flu vaccines annually one insane reason other. 


A lot people horrible reactions flu shots. Also idk single person working medical field takes flu shot. one knew allergic reaction never took again, u ask she’ll give conspiracy reason taking probs realistically don’t want get sick get bad reaction certain eventually keep getting it. mean stop you. Mock away. I’m old enough remember people called conspiracy theorists claimed vaccine would mandated. 

Now thread full people celebrating mandates mandates come.  Well bless heart. whiny little child, running around yelling ""it's fair!"" Reality is, crying change that. part walking dead, know happens TV show. Seattle exists. 

Seattle got everything else rest America.

That's materials. mostly comes china. 

There still labor component. Small business profitable eventually raise prices. make money stock market, would run business barely profitable? Seriously. *wouldn’t* want name directly linked modern miracle.

I’m fonder Pfizer rare example medicine working should. Fast, effective, available, affordable &amp; didn’t exploit dire need extract every dollar possible. 

My regret 68 year old uncle (and last living relative) lifelong severe asthmatic, obese &amp; already massive doses steroids couldn’t get trial hospital broken back. high risk risk untested vaccine negligible comparison. Sadly hindsight 2020, lot unknowns &amp; home state Florida active denial. 

He (almost definitely) contacted COVID hospital &amp; passed 5 days positive test. anyone know might happened gotten vaccine immediately exposure &amp; prior symptomatic? That’s said ‘lessens removes’ Example - chicken pox vaccine. 95% efficacy, children still get adults. goes polio - nearly eradicated, still forms could potentially mutate (specifically Africa). thanks herd immunity. may immune it, never completely blocked - especially pre-existing conditions weakened immune systems already. pain small part it, traumatic experience needles general unfortunately…I know I’ll fine it’s pre-anxiety horrendous :(  I've applying jobs - got bunch notices applications final review! Here's hoping. wish ill supervisor. want see creating harm around. 

I remote first month lockdown. forced back office April last year.  Gosh, almost like things going well governor says is... think word trademarked SMPP org (Small Mushroom Pee Pee Organization). mean, also oppose mandates, got voluntarily... logic probably work tinfoil hat people. I'm going discussion good faith, I'm going come sideways way.

Nothing outright stop Covid entering body. possible.

However, evidence initial intake virus seems factor damaging person.

Per recent data, 97% ICU patients unvaccinated. show whole picture, people chose get vaccine likely taking precautions across board. (This what's meant Good Faith arguments, I'm completely transparent here).

If vaccine reduces symptoms, reduce initial viral intake passed healthy person. everyone passing reduced viral intake, we're keeping people ICU otherwise would bad shape.

Vaccines like airbags, still going sore afterward, reduces chance death. depends whether go place tries go health insurance. health insurance gets run, apparently get rejected (according one friend J&amp;J). No, uncertainty gravity, causes it, etc. pretty good understanding phenomena, outliers exist. 

By way, using one well-studied phenomena claim certainty exist science missing point. took lot work develop understanding gravity. work necessitated dealing uncertainty - still level uncertainty even well understood phenomenon.

You’re completely immune getting COVID shot. vaccine - either lessens nearly removes life-altering effects friends family military basically said STRONGLY encouraged get might well called mandated formality 

But go wonder many posts we’ll start seeing next 24 hours mandates never said vaccines long term data. Maybe misread comment. I'm referring covid vaccine. simple fact long term data covid vaccine.

Anti vaxxers way tell people space lizard’s Bingo. career die failure.   “Private back room” code something, right? hope guys right. Bad mistake USA true, excellent many countries. think elimination works, people lie, snuck in, pretend pandemic.

So elimination work.

You live reality. People lie, sneak in, break quarantines etc. account making calculation. We've using emergency approval, excuse people using refuse vaccine. FDA reviewed data submitted formally announced consider vaccine safe effective.

In fact, [here’s whole list vaccines brand CDC. Serious question: studies compared equally sized control group? many symptoms non-specific would exist great numbers placebo group (headache, stomach ache, brain fog). know one study kids actually compared placebo group difference barely significant.  Also, many symptoms clear point? common people symptoms 1-2 months bad flu/cold, permanent. row? let's start seeing mandates. welcome cold blood....

Yeah, viruses work. getting save someone else great terms everyone might get cancer eventually, need intentionally spreading lethal infectious diseases around.

Sure, there's reason take reasonable precautions. That's wear seatbelt get checkups. That's also got vaccinated earliest opportunity. 

But know people whose goal seems death-avoidance, point rarely take chances anything fun, even Covid, makes sad. didn’t even include “mrna” “mirna” lol I’m austria call biontech/pfizer media. never one name alone. Mine mandating it, I'm pleasantly surprised. American people want easy answer affect life. ""But muh rights"" usually stand ""but muh selfishness"".

Yes course that's plan, shut borders rest eternity. 


What's subreddit ridiculous exxagerations. plan open cautiously population highly vsccinated. know, obvious logical thing do. think sounds like ""C'mere, naughty"". seems addressing as-yet unvaccinated. Higher ups tend older, older people way averse change. There's reason many older people struggle even resent technology.

Management share people fool higher ups thinking useful micromanaging, far harder staff working remotely. Sounds like drug would exist cyberpunk movie. states already insurance companies aren’t covering people hospitalization COVID.

Why talking furries? r/nottheonion mentioned year ago, people like ""Oh past SARS virus pretty stable, think worry that."" turns out, pandemic numbers virus shitzillions chances mutate, something's gonna mutate. company company B 50% market share neither bothers spending money marketing net gain society.

Health insurance companies great example waste. used spend 30%-40% marketing! got bad one major reforms ACA cap expenditures bullshit 20%.

Actually, health care another thing, yeah, limiting amount insurance companies would *great*. state there's dozens identically-shitty health insurers pay medicare money take cut privilege so.

In countries like U.S., boosting *literally everyone*. moral catastrophe.

Looking province's response pandemic, abundantly clear: political conservatism antithesis functioning cohesive society. Every province disastrous pandemic response, save one, led majority conservative government; one managed escape relatively unscathed (New Brunswick) almost certainly saved social proximity remaining maratime provinces. Do…do work company? 🤔 attitude Spread would lot lower herd immunity. That's literally every vaccine works. Yea I’ve got lot friends think vaccine dangerous COVID isn’t. told months ago they’d get vaccine FDA approve. 

Put shut time

PS: it’s ironic trust government doctors tell vaccine safe effective. Instead, you’ll wait government doctors tell it’s safe via government agency like FDA struggle find sympathy vaccine available free. choice expert, don’t think HIPAA prevents reporting data aggregate.

[HIPAA *kind of* get they're getting shit done. Maybe need training regular status updates. using office punishment seems ... counterproductive. Like, wasting everyone's time money punish 1 person.  Paying entire office space entails sake minor, dubious form leverage. 

Either way, worry trap managers fall seeing people productive 5 hours day thinking WFH, realizing people productive 2 hours day before. Appearances tricky. Ohhhhhhhh know this. Here's thought you: 'senior leaders' actually workplace bullies, using status leverage get junior employees help goals/tasks. 

They *hate* junior staff interrupt dictate to.

I worked unusual, high-end niche consultancy 90's 'exploded office' (made WFH option viable one) that's saw.

To managing directors' great credit, immediately saw told 'senior guys' buckle work.

Interesting year, year. Florida'svaccinated#s run south north. North Florida counties lowest rates. Guess virus killing themost? understand worry? I'm work nothing done wrong what's problem? Micromanaging. all! Leave alone! I'm still working. Let happy volume, morbidity. nice hear logical answer. stupidity america killing me. Well...more like killing them.  logic, try mandate ANYTHING, since slippery slope.  feel you. It’s definitely problem. much productive pandemic started, even though 4 2 year old home me. mental health ok back then. I’m home alone, since mental health destroyed there’s hope things calming anytime soon, it’s impossible productive. Aren’t businesses saving money overhead? Electricity hundreds computers running florescent lights, office space - think they’d happy. Anecdotes don’t interest    Oh stinks! Forgot seasonal thing. Best luck guys. see percentage. it?  idiots near midwest claim know doctors nurses ""coming vaccine."" Complete rubbish. one stupid argument other. can, lot 2 year olds, easy. all.

Our record 2 year old around 30 seconds. Average 15 seconds. like trying, takes take simple grasp face understand needs wear it.  Going paraphrase simplify: manager's job help reports successful. Sorry man, staying overnight hospital doctor telling going run lab tests simply double vaxxed- big problem... everyone agrees past three decades, Dr. Toni Darville treated sickest children suffering viral illnesses — especially flu. […] Covid-19 pandemic different. Darville estimates seen number severely ill kids coronavirus single season 30 years treating seriously ill kids ""I think lay public understands gravity intensity virus,"" said. loaded question nice whataboutism. question whether long-term damage year without in-person learning damaging COVID. Given [nearly half students failed least one class remote significant share students adequate resources home learn virtually parents may able properly care work, it’s hard see worth children make [0.7% total hospitalizations hell would worry boss? saving much money lease giant office, pay parking, corporate ISPs, crafty, etc etc.. They've effectively offloaded huge chunk overhead employees maintain home offices, internet, power, AC, etc., employees grateful cheaper them, too.

IMO people worry middle-managers micromanagement actual management exposed superfluous efficient teams without constantly butting in. mental health mess

God, tell it. honestly probably real problem right now, hard problem solve much can't control. Seems like knowing scenario currently experiencing would help hospitals better plan future. delta spreading faster, surge might closer over. delta makes kids sicker, may last 2 3 months rather burning quickly. mom amazed many nurses hospital initially refusing get vaccine. Well bunch went started vaccine series. Why? covid moved floors got witness first hand horrible disease death is. Privacy important able see bad whole thing might give people clarity. Sheesh it'd nice job that's labor intensive, wish physically anywhere lol talk dream! Honestly - sound like nightmare. True we've wasting doses already people refusing get it. choices shouldnt affect production, feel thats companies. assume catch it, get sick spread even vaccinated.

Wear damn mask.

Vaccine help stay vent die. agree, reason concerned. never knew going play out. wait see happens. Remind me, what’s counterpoint ignoring doctors, becoming optimal host spreading deadly pathogen overloading national healthcare system? always dragged feet those. I'm surprised added back interior quickly did...

I'm hoping she'll issue schools sometime start. Quarantining sick isolating population different NZ doing, isolating entire population regardless whether they're sick not. Countries relied quarantining would places like Taiwan, South Korea, Singapore. took 3rd Pfizer. similar experience second dose, perhaps bit worse hard tell chemo second everything already sucked. Also, trials boosters report significant difference side effects reported.

You handle it, weekend.  Since number [recent Well hospitals almost overrun - suggesting let COVID burn population without additional mitigation measures ever again, healthcare system collapses it? I'm yet. 

Children 12 still can't get vaccine, know they're risk serious infection way adult is, still facilitate spread create far potential breakthrough infections vaccinated still risk serious infection. tons people getting significantly ill even vaccine - that's serious disease is. 

I know ""flattening curve"" faux-optimistic propaganda times, still valid responsibility healthcare system society. want 55 year-old father, genetic pre-disposition heart disease despite remarkably fit healthy otherwise, die otherwise treatable heart attack hospitals clogged COVID patients. brief return normalcy spread control, next time get likely even better, vaccination rates higher natural immunity gets us closer ""herd immunity"" sorts. 

Ultimately see wearing mask inside giant intrusion living normal life. Shit still crazy want get even worse. agree you. think reluctant people get idea reinforced vaccines work get first 2.

Mandating school work real thing makes difference. 378k seems like particularly huge number, first glance tending little implausible. However, excess deaths 115k end last year, 2nd wave delta came along top - official death figures delta wave much larger two came before. 


The population still 5% fully vaccinated, big delta wave going nasty indeed. remember used feel like 0 time anything work days. basically 4 hours free time per day 30-40 minute commute (depending traffic) one way 1-1.5 hours lost there, waking 30 minutes early take shower get ready (I shower first break home lol), like 3-4 work shirts 2 work pants laundry least twice per week, money spent filling gas, etc. sucked. allow fact companies run people like working home? That's simpler answer attempting gap big conspiracy. Wall Street Journal caters specific group consumers, particularly noteworthy hill willing die on. they're wrong. smart companies realize could huge shift work. backwards ones change quickly enough, suffer competition offer remote work incentive. lost business similar manner real ones Amazon, real careful screen potentially fake ones. example Kimberly Clark one, made USA, shipped sold (i.e. third party sellers).

Unfortunately can't provide link - tried earlier censored automod. search it.  claim *for fixed Ct*, vaccinated people lower cell culture positivity. Hi. looked dshs site last three days reporting change? told mortality bad, ICU need massive. 6500 hospital total c. 68,000,000 somewhere around half ICU alone 9 million people. 
What's baseline state health Texas?  WTF Bill? 😋 Considering miniscule risk involved actual risk pure neuroticism. Shooting multiple dogs couple people tempted drive miles mixture administrative cowardice psychopathy. Maybe variant wakeup call need. would get serious put effort truly take things control.

Instead always saying ""this good enough"" giving virus leeway next wave comes, would say ""this ends"" forced put worldwide aggressive measures stop virus tracks. I'm new workforce seen metric tracking time .1 times thread - mean? mean account every 6 minutes?

I suspect many managers, disciplinarian (manage walking around bully slavedriver, leader coach) hate reason. spend enery time going people versus demanding come stumbling across yoir day.

Plus lost many social status power cues. 'Mahogany Row' empty. corner office is... pointless. executive boardroom is... storage. reserved parking spot is... empty.

So, yeah. see managers around wanting office wonder much company people. Outdoors indoors? one thing big businesses need help lower taxes. Yeah know mechanics can’t work home professor Florida state college. wish could afford quit same. awful. thought open offices cancelled? reddit least, seems concept rented shared general workspace makes people seethe rage. need fast track vaccines kids 12 vaccine history required 2-3 months safety data.

I’m sure depends kid, it’s worth encouraging. hurdle over? feel like middle much worse 2020. problem. thought saw something like Pfizer/BioNTech can't find right told boss choose work home, decision next three years, way don’t get space office saves money rental costs get testing travel. also covered cost us $145 per person U.S.   Restaurants, building owners, cleaning staff, hotels, taxis, team building even services, lot hurt people. agree -- lived worked Manhattan years. Finally moved medium CoL area New England.

Looking back now, incredibly freeing, much life improved.

My company, thankfully, always remote-first, (as individuals) want WFH, hybrid, office-always, preferences valued prioritized. people chose get jabbed next. It’s amazing spouse working home. Paid ton debt traveling outings, saving lunches commutes, payments deferred student loans.

I wish didn’t cost many fucking lives tear country new asshole. Calm Hudson. Also tl;dr states involved California, Alabama, Georgia, Kansas, Oklahoma Wisconsin, there's specific location information privacy concerns. course not. Lol. miss coffee machine talks though. shows one part immune response previous variant effective exposed new variant. However, prove body infected either scratch better worse. also representative real, previously infected body, many immune mechanisms, plus new antibodies generated new epitopes infection. Sadly hospital work looking religious exemptions employees getting pass. It’s bullshit. Basically hospital legal reasons say mandated it, letting everyone fill exemption. getting approved. -Elkhart, indiana article cite saying opinion? Same!! everyone working home last year commute cut half. amazing.  Please sacrifice cafeteria. 

Sincerely,

Someone works business dining managed get laid last year

(But yes, agree parking spot traffic bit. awesome) Lol…. Make maybe twice week?? Savings Bought new round everything creme month ago I'm kicking wasting money. valid conversation perhaps point, aren’t even zip code right now. Morons pushing false info extend global pandemic holds everyone hostage calls exclusion arenas public life. “corporations”. people don’t feel safe mask even cubicle conducting video meetings masks on. know happen if/when go in. want Delta variant get worse, also want back work full time 9/7.

 makes worse almost virtual advancements staying public. forced back office continue working still WFH. Fucking boggles mind learned almost nothing. people going stuck behind paywall NYT. went back college later life ended picking philosophy minor. Yet, hasn’t one specific philosophy I’m like “oh that’s it!” Still looking find that, every time get close, something else pops makes say “maybe not?” someone wedding November, I’m pretty nervous. hope city I’m replaces mask mandate vaccine mandate. honourable mention? mandate flights pretty please?? 

That alone game changer. Sure..you freedom choice. hope like driving 12hrs vacation. Seriously. miss ghost town roads had. Zero stress commutes great. Ty!! Yeah, constantly amazed people wearing ""chin diapers"" mask longer covering nose mouth. No, get points wearing mask around chin. tried looking outside state? virtual job, state matter. None coworkers live state.

edit: clear, people *company* live state. one work directly. Wow, sounds like extremely toxic work environment.  Evidence either one fine. vaccine slows transmission point r value still greater 1 90% vaccinated people masking up, result same; virus spreads quickly endangers hospital system. 

That public health threat. health system could absorb this, need worry individuals choosing get vaccinated. 

The message self preservation work see danger. message caring others work selfish smell bullshit. vaccine umbrella holes it. message responsibility *might* work. 90% sub two months ago get you’re saying remember need die first. countries without adequate medical systems, without insurance, preexisting conditions, etc. people least deserve probably ones dying we’re talking globally. Look many politicians lied pandemic vaccines, discouraged masks, etc got COVID survived despite risk age medical categories. Trump got antibody treatment widely available. folks probably vote environmental protections. generally agree this, major drawback noticed training. junior lawyer, found incredibly helpful people disposal ask questions, build relationships, learn expectations etc… law school prepare legal practice. senior associate work home great me. recent juniors, noticed development slowed “getting it”. think 2-3 day week thing would trick (if everyone came days). Either that, training gets significantly overhauled combat issue. Yeah I'm sure best solution is. also pay lot taxes, deductible good insurance necessarily sound terrible me, haha. I'm unsure Europe's system works.

I'll try remember let know! I'm hoping get going asap! Maybe make people sign waiver overflow space.

No sign, treatment DoD Docs. Covid traffic best Here's stats: beginning January 2020 August 4, 2021, 606,389 deaths caused COVID-19 United States, around 179,114 occurred among aged 85 years older. statistic shows number coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) deaths U.S. January 2020 August 2021, age.""

Deaths:
Age 50-64 97k

Age 65+= 480k 

Age 0-49= 29k deaths

You take 606k Aug. 4th. 

80% deaths far yo

@17% deaths far 50-65 

@3% deaths ages 0-49  know mean. I've able go bike ride every day (as opposed weekends only) since work around at-home schedule. cruel irony deadly pandemic I've able get best shape life. that's mention financial gain, like mentioned. Unfortunately nurses seem need refresher vaccines work horrible ARDS is. seem confuse political beliefs actual evidence based science it’s embarrassing profession. provinces report weekends there's slightly higher uptick every Monday. Bona fide masks, black kn95s. care liability, health problem labor shortage, living wage shortage. boca news??? even reliable??? statistics link saying there’s 212 deaths week Florida basically time period? knows believe never context given? thing I’d like add-My son NZ states people much trust government US. Therefore follow quarantine lockdown rules diligently. PayPal?  wish around require vaccines, Lollapalooza shows sorta events work. favorite bedtime reading. logged Facebook 6 years ago logged back in. needs go way Myspace. echochamber chaos hate. Well going like example 44 States allow religious exemptions existing vaccination laws students.

Private companies probably won’t even many restrictions right work States. 

However real reason mandates written way make even claiming exemption results negative repercussions people won’t attempt long. We’ve already seen already created mandates require enhanced testing persons expense example, loss compensated time dealing covid  absolutely great family too. Tons money, wife worked 17 months, 2 months full pay benefits.  friends miss them. Plus retirement accounts 20% since election.  Life's pretty good.  Every experiment needs control group ... course deadly disease often end well control group Ah yes super tight lockdown Victoria working marvelously. Sorry misinterpreted question. Usually someone words question like they’re looking validation.  Exactly. straightforward get reply everyone sitting home anyway. people working home answer, put 'not favour' maintain balance. impossible survey statistically representative population without asking every single person, all. Ahh. 

So. would happened FDA ended approving it? do. literally publish first hand accounts! Videos what's happening. get much evidential that. Also, CIA propagandists regularly criticise CIA rest US government? sounds like ghetto pronunciation word community  Absolutely. want vaccine? Fine, that's right. know what's right? Full access society potential danger society. welcome live cabin woods vaccine free want.  get article, argument, got car tried run workers. issue enough even speculate terrorist charge. There's information argument motive attack. Mine walked told recalled day. 2 appointments 1 shot Wow. soon. love it.   Agreed, risk it. 

The best way encouraging isolation support people isolation.

Make illegal fire person, send work house see need supplies. Go team science! Look CDC walking back decision rescind masks fully vaccinated, much harm public confidence. I'm fan vaccine promote anyone know it. 12 y/o vaccinated 3 days birthday. single mitigation though, thought covering holes Swiss cheese stacking slices--masks, vaccines, distanceing adding layer Swiss cheese. One layers honesty leadership--messaging needs truthful marketing. way someone vaccinated comes cold, know could Covid know take precautions spreading it.  Ohh wait see guess. First start WFH... they'll find cheaper person outside city... outside country.

Outsourcing happen overnight. took 20+ years America get gutted production.

If think going happen people WFH... well wrong... much difference 1/1 Nah, Obama knew would one negatives: people covered even make outrageously poor decisions. Genuinely curious: killing host beneficial virus?  sweet embrace death  Thank saying part. People realize decent amount cases people went hospital, got tested realized asymptomatic covid. taken concerted action situation became disastrous. nobody could known danger. Whoa! see coming.  Yes absolutely right, hence manufacturing growing US... hope time ventilator short Ah shit proud boys must loading guns now.  office wants us back wear masks. ask point is? safe safe? mean compared already place? post made show covid vaccines harmful. made show full transparency vaccine contains clear misconceptions.

Imagine NZ would started vaccinating back December like UK. would still say government fuck up. giving boosters, rest world get chance get 2 shots? Everybody know tried, managed get shot (at least first) going holidays, avoid delay it.

Vaccine calendars ramped june july reach that. end July 20´s could get appointment one two days, least Madrid know, due people going holidays vaxing irresponsible. 

However I´d rather lot irresponsible late vaccinated people bunch anti-vax hope you´re right. affect virus bat? basically host? personally finish disliked characters. Plus, blatantly racist. no, idc ""it written 70s makes racism ok."" difficult enjoy. There’s “freedom” endanger health patients. 

We clearly problem medical education. 

Nurses doctors trust Fox News social media medical training find new career. daily commuting, less eating out, wear nicer clothes saves much time, money, stress. take nap lunch im tired, eat freshly cooked food isnt reheated microwave, quiet. Cube farms get loud annoying. last job, desk right front high traffic hallway. got annoying put huge cardboard cutout get distracted people walking by. hang around people vaccinated

Don't hang people. Stay bubble. Make sure people bubble stay bubble. say all. Sure hand horse shaped pills cure. Wow... that’s fucked up. That's one wish never saw definitely click good number shiny object distracted elsewhere get tested flu? education level self-reported verified. respondents reported average education levels higher general population

Given many medical assistants call ""nurses"", feeling there's something this. Shep cluster looks another breach NSW. (While border restrictions place).

There border restrictions removalists started earlier Melbourne outbreak well (but tight). absolutely right, misread vaccination info, actually says:

""All people **born 2007, 2008 2009 12 years old**, regardless insurance make appointment first vaccination dose..."" statement know hundreds hundreds people personally got vaccine reason whole New Zealand total lockdown, can't go work, can't leave home except excercise buy food. We've lockdown since first case emerged we'll lockdown safe ease restrictions. current restrictions enough, they'll increased. 

I get experience Vietnam different, Vietnam.  saying exist, shouldn't. putting young people hospital point pandemic.

I think complicated that. People tired (I think they're whining set aside) young people likely engage risky behavior. control group. We're guessing here. certainly clear young people getting infected seriously ill. clear Delta different people behaving poorly year ago. end, matter: vaxx + mask + distance + STFH. US financial muscle it. will. see reaction lot. I’m really proud response far delaying population vaccine part it. envy world ~18 months get envious others wait vaccinations catch up. Perhaps predicted delta might planned differently still cannot complain. folks high salaries work home. Typically technology, legal medical sectors. think 80% salary covered govt. Employer makes rest need it. They've monitoring number companies took money early volunteered back end using it. Businesses adapted pretty rapidly first lockdowns. point many people level productivity matter put them,

I buy second. Say dropped middle Sahara right now. productive work day would have? seriously without going extremes even small changes environment make huge difference people's productivity. Check related studies. Anecdotally, I've vaccinated friends came seemed like really bad colds. One tested positive covid, others negative - multiple times. Eventually, began get positive results tests made wonder many others might've experienced bad cold negative test never went subsequent re-testing (I didn't) actually positive. Back poster boy! Roughly 1 3 police officers America vaccinated certainly make educated guess 5. Many RNs HCW many things healthy. I've seen scores outside hospital work next to, standing outside smoking, morbidly obese. bad hospital ban smoking hospital grounds, building, enforce it.

Amazing much progress make zero percent interest. talking nurses, it’s obviously gotta education level

Older nurses didn’t even need bachelors degree. Newer nurses need one it’s still nothing compared med school. took science classes there’s much learn 4 year degree (2 courses every degree takes: math/lit/history). It’s even close education. 

And there’s people truly don’t care science want actually learn. People easily “learn” what’s necessary pass exams. even great healthcare workers needed job take care people. doesn’t mean they’re going practice preach away work though. 

To many (I’d say most) it’s job. go in, need to, go home think it. don’t actually apply science real everyday life. enough job No, employer make “best endeavours” cover much possible. employer covered 60% government 20%, asked work 4 days week last year L4. Plus employer show lockdown lessened come 30% compared time last year get subsidy theory behavior healthcare workers become jaded healthcare system totally refusing sort preventative measures. vast majority patients people go way take care pump full meds. don’t want hear preventative measures doctors rarely talk it. 

Collectivists living libertarian society? Ok, similar UK. imagine people Auckland higher salaries still quite affected. what's nudge looking start taking action? Gregory Poland headed discussion, find credentials Mayo Clinic website. us barely enough get fired anyways, bruh....

That's bro. Reddit. Leeches gonna leech nurses take lower level biology class, chemistry, anatomy nurses, rest nursing, core classes like writing, electives.  

A 2nd year Biology major probably better understanding stuff RN’s, it’s Nursing schools teach.  12s???

Viruses care killing host, quite opposite. care reproducing. 99.99% mutations make easier infect, easier kill. kills, can't spread. Please, bring mandates! Pfizer shot able moved shortly. millions vaccination slots add in. explains difference vax rates nurses docs?

Education levels scientific literacy.  hate people much culture perpetuates this. everyone ""take day off"" they're sick without ramifications can't afford. full salaries, no. $600 week iirc. Lol, even bother comment this? sure, Delta different beast. spreading VIC despite strict lockdown. What’s worst case Ontario Cases still growing hard lock Melbourne.

He right, get worse.  Paying salaries 180m adults different whatever NZ citizens. article cite comparing February numbers June numbers.

Florida cut benefits end June, it’s labor shortage abated since then. /r/recycledjoke still understand people say that. virus, 1 case turn 10 cases day later. New Zealand boat Australia they're way behind rest West comes vaccination.  little less pretty much - 17× (not *as)* likely = 17/18th total risk unvaccinated person, vs. identical, vaccinated one. works 0.44% recurring (or 1/225). course that's probably little precise, COVID deaths still heavily age stratified.

Apparently, 65+, 2019, [they 50k deaths 6M symptomatic cases flu, there's approximately 1 85 chance death among elderly catch symptomatic flu. course, there's huge difference health 95-year old 65-year-old. Amazed humanity destroying ourselves. Test free, “office visit” $150 Yeah...I know. Stupid.  much US.

The sorts restrictions listed widespread throughout US Europe throughout last wrong. There's even commonality within US Europe.

I think perspective fundamentally different mine. I'm comparing US Europe countries like China New Zealand. comparing different US states European countries one another. differences different US states even cities responded pandemic, insignificant comparison differences US China. China New Zealand zero-tolerance policies towards virus. US Europe policy living virus (and accepting huge numbers deaths process). UK 30k day 100+ deaths even give shit anymore.

I think restrictions travelling certain countries requiring 10 day quarantine after. even know sports games require rests vaccination, concerts do.

We 60% vaccination rate we've honestly given trying anything else phrase always reminds movie clip : local hospital system ( 11 hospitals total ) publishing covid census numbers every day graphical format breakout vaccinated vs unvaccinated total covid admissions, covid ICU population, covid vent use. still willing take blame it. go far. Especially Melbourne. city getting around 50-60 cases day. Still single death year. ideal far smashed. Growing vaccinated almost anything. never issue anti vax conspiracy nutjobs made one. military distribute food Healthcare. DeSantis issued executive order prohibiting masks requirements schools grounds strip parents rights decide what's best children. Hanna said press conference Sunday week schools open asked flexibility temporary enforce mask mandate ages 5-11, never heard back governor. Hanna announced mandate days Florida Board Education Friday ordered two school district Alachua Broward counties drop mask requirements lose state funding. wife traveled Europe last four years COVID. eager get vaccine ASAP might able go back. people circles surprised we're booking things Germany October case global lockdowns people like ""oh wow got vaccine soon could? knew safe?""

It's funny people conspiratorial big pharma saying everything money realize releasing deadly vaccine would detrimental capital. developers three different geographic locations. get everyone office anyway, meant team meetings would 2/3 people room rest dialled remotely. nightmare, remote ones always hear clearly delay gets exacerbated.

Now we're remote, completely leveled playing field. Collaboration far easier efficient. lot easier jump call someone trying find space free.

Collaboration reason we're going remote.  took start vaccinating four main stages. Stage one front line stage four anyone 65 believe. Stage four however done stages think we're currently ages 40+ allowed vaccinate. urgency vaccinate waited could get phizer whole country added slowness. people hesitant (my Nanna said iffy could cause fertility issues young women Granny's friend said allergic antibiotics something thought allergic vaccine) ofc anti-vaxers Facebook old people trust anyone's false information met IRL.  There's reason health minister said rethinking long term strategy Delta. Delta around since April.

What's point? point many people level productivity matter put them, one ever spending entire day entirely focused work. people work achieve tasks, don’t work like ants. aren’t delivering, personal integrity management problem. There's clearly difference education intellectual capacity doctors nurses regardless want think. Nsw* explains difference vax rates nurses docs? Gladys complete disaster mostly Kiwi quarantine system? 

Can nsw blame outbreak whatever country gave quarantine beach? Yeah it’s like military name change “soldiers” “troops” killed wars

Troops much impersonal way describe soldiers. It’s psychological manipulation

Example 1: 250 soldiers killed today versus 250 troops lost.

Southern states trying minimize learn many deaths multiple means obscurity people get food? company regional bank forced everyone back work June 1. made adjustments go back stay home even though cases deaths surging Oklahoma. last crazy Australian authoritarian lockdown fanatics recognise data showing time. military’s busy picking refugees atm NZ like 18% vaccinated? really highlight infectious delta is. Ships. lots ships transporting men.

You may want check Guam pandemic. pandemic moved slower, moved.  don’t get either country gained travel bubble. Especially NZ cluster fuck here. Fairs happening, music concerts, etc etc. one gives fuck. friend icu nurse right outside CLT said getting really bad. insane people think ""bad cold"". Even though son's school district enforcing masks, I'm still keeping out. going wait-and-see goes
 Sucks cause kindergarten year.
We beer wine store/bar. first city re-require masks upon entry. People dense get mad. employees children protect. But, know, freedoms Thank much :) think recommend third shot 8 months second one, first availability coming U.S. around 09/20 ""Conservative opposition irresponsible dangerous.""

Most world, time. don’t know much vaccine rollout New Zealand. availability? main issue cost. Woo poor college student, especially university Alabama. 

I've got access 3d printers trash, though. wonder make reusable helmet/mask/rebreather type thing uses smaller filters need replaced occasionally... work state capitol downtown local newspaper editorial calling state workers return downtown support downtown business struggling. I’m hear fix city’s lack urban planning inability support downtown businesses maybe cleaning streets getting rid abandoned buildings make downtown blight. want back office support mediocre restaurants services dirty downtown areea. I’m sorry businesses can’t compete without captive audience, food better people would go free will, due trapped downtown.
Oh, burned main city hall parking garage (quite feat burn 7 story concrete parking garage, it), bad need park. mass transit horrible. 80% population susceptible covid delta got country. less 300 ICU beds 600 ventilators. 

Yeah I'd concerned right New Zealand. *Everyone* going need new set skills. going bit ride sorry. Delta virus want compare others hate “will ever go back normal?” crap. It’s year half. Yes, long time indication things calm immediate future. (we meaning humanity, unfortunately many thousands individuals) get go whatever normal looks like side. isn’t first horrific thing happen human history feels eternal we’re living it. breakthrough infection vaccinated person catches COVID. symptoms, symptoms usually means test, would never know breakthrough infection. Correct. I'm sure enforced. I'm hickory ones wearing masks. Difference being, early days Sydney, decided take much action. lol ADHD here. Working home fucking owns every time. 

My team voluntarily comes office. We've somehow become pretty tight knit group friends we're friends coworkers, acknowledge that's pretty rare work environments. somehow miraculously collectively wanted make working together, going work every day like hanging out... we're pretty passionate we're developing integrations apps move fast, carry company backs. deploy months back stayed office till 4am, skateboarding around office supporting checklist things needed sequentially cut new system. much fucking fun drinks shots deploying integrations. personally go full work home get people would want to, we've even people really adamant WFH permanently come office 4 days week they're acknowledging something special here. work culture definitely fostered top down, I'd say we're 1% companies shit. company, gonna get people want come plain simple. 

Fucking crazy much innovate like white boarding session, bullshit, crack jokes, etc coming pretty crazy stuff. nice walk architects desk like ""the fuck this"" end going biggest rabbit hole ideas walking back others computers coding real fast, everyones excitedly computers trying solve something. Swear god fun silicon valley tv show we're enjoying every day we're there. Funny thing we're even start company, we're publicly traded lmao. Yeah, think fully vaccinated, go back normal accept period time, experience drop life expectancies increase deaths. covid becomes endemic like influenza, likely pop seasonally need annual boosters, hopefully deadly. Building trust big deal. think anyone saying Sydney 4 weeks back, majority 100 cases sort quarantine great many investigation. Dude Appstate lost student last year covid. Look Instagram... ones wearing masks. Kind sad Alum right now. I'm Hickory Asking UK here. updates info borders opening international travel? trip booked early September since cancelled. wanted know hope late September/October trip? indoor dining ok hold bit? ""Don't it? violation right"". Yes, people reacting like area, sign words never reach them. That's true, 358 ICU beds another 629 ICU ventilators public health system equipment reserve. high OECD standards issue highly trained ICU nurses amount beds.

But, re-opening occurs everyone ample time get vaccinated, surprised get 80% vaccination rate. course, subject change driven latest research time decision. Israel pharma feeding us snake oil announcements year half. 17x 94% efficacy death, numbers lay while. saying numbers slightly different way. present new information, repeated phrases we've already heard. Although missing school home learning bad parents struggle work teach kids time etc would argue missing year, maybe even two years schools negligible affect long term education child. They'll quickly catch wherever would anyway.  poor bosses offices Okay, you’re concerned New Zealand zero covid cases? Please mr virologist, thoughts lauric acid antiviral properties? ~~help~~

*still destroy fractionally slowly*

FTFY point arguing simply argue. Nothing said makes sense. FUCK CARES?! long productivity people getting shit done, work home let them. 

Goddamn. 

Same people arguing against, hardly ever got office themselves. Jesus. understand comparison? experienced workplaces yet. impression New Zealand somewhere United States? Melbourne's lockdown considered tough NZ standards. Two weeks still playgrounds open childcare essential workers. Even allow takeaways lot shops like butchers bakeries open. Syndey's lockdown joke barely called lockdown. I'd even fine working longer hours, exchange 3, 4 day weekend. 

If sit @ work 8 hours, 10 hours makes little difference. day shot anyhow. rather full days free daylight. pretty sure office productivity myth busted new wave remote business waits end pandemic. Yea, really low. I’m hoping sake us get onto more. They’ve decided get health students (nursing, medicine, pharmacy, medlab etc) trained testing, I’d like see train people vaccinate too! Fun fact article: China approaching two-billionth administered vaccine dose. China could manage, 5x population US. parking lot \*bad people\* used charge arm leg parking \*speaking out\* loudest this.

Gonna preface saying I’m vaccinated. Everyone please get vaccinated

My theory behavior healthcare workers become jaded healthcare system totally refusing sort preventative measures. vast majority patients people go way take care pump full meds. don’t want hear preventative measures doctors rarely talk it.

Not much US. actually even large parts Europe countries historically way stricter US terms restrictions. think there's lot commonality responses pandemic US Europe

Then wrong. There's even commonality *within* US Europe.  US prior 2019 Jan, wide community spread states researchers looked prior 2019 Jan.

You mean Jan 2020 right?   Quit  fair we’ve big scanning in/contact tracing, masks public transport, etc since Covid arrived last year. definitely restrictions they’re relatively noninvasive part daily life. love covid lifted veil. People sick tired cogs machine.  ""Here's ice pack"" Honestly they’ve really slow, really really slow. I’m completely sure why. However, last week opened vaccine bookings anyone 40+ stats show 75% 40+ either first vaccine/both/ booked it! 

On Wednesday opens 30+s too, 1st anyone 30! however lot hesitancy drives bloody mad. I’m biomedical science major focus infection immunity people think Google true doctors. We’ll fucked rate apparently it’s conspiracy it’s experimental vaccine smh. many people decided don’t want Pfizer shareholders rejoice! seriously, that’s good news considering Delta’s impact already fully vaccinated. No, conflating spending track trace (ie mass testing measure successful) spending app....which patently ridiculous.   Again, provided specific examples countries NZ’s position. got complacent too.  Hey hear you, I've got plenty frustrations pandemic handling everywhere. 

By token though, really frustrating see people NZ act like ""if world done did"" would avoided fates. disagree assessment, someone lived pandemic London, often comes across smug people parrot it. think fact picked like baton partisan Americans hit head exacerbated that, course blame kiwis for.

FWIW, I'm NZ. I'm go NZ, I'm glad parents rampant covid community last 18 months. also think plenty elements response deserving criticism, precedents set think negative lasting cultural impact already isolated often xenophobic place. I’ve commented people still allowed go grocery stores whenever please.  beginning COVID crisis, rented little office 2 minutes home.  

It’s perfect me…. psychological “border” home work, close enough easily slip home lunch, urgent chore. alone office, concerns social distancing work day without needing think wearing mask.

In terms cost, easily pays long commute car anymore. sourdough still average best. rewana going ok though. hope level 4 going ok!  limited since mid-2020 - far limited developed world. 

We're talking right now, stop citing 2020 past months like nothing changed we're still facing dychotomy ""do nothing suffer later vs. hard tough less damage long term"". longer works like that. We're talking much covid zero strategy sustainable compares right last month, China succeeded ending serious outbreak since original one Wuhan, cities ended locked - tiny fraction country.

A cities tens millions people, anyway, restrictions still applied country wide, that's even point; point uncertainty. People Western countries pretty safely bet fact harsh measures anymore. Chinese people can't. Business West start investing resuming international affairs, whereas China remains completely isolated. *will* countless new outbreaks, every single time China lock number people spend countless resources test everyone quickly, get worse worse time lockdown fatigue likes, happened anywhere else. mention Olympics next winter. truly think way sustainable long term, China smart country literally every country pursued similar approach moving away realized longer sustainable, I'm afraid deluded.

China *will* let covid spread. figure way without generating mass panic. It'll take streak bad luck especially bad outbreak.

I'm happy share thoughts, though, guess stand this.

It's terribly important vaccinate many people worldwide can, prevent severe disease death, also slow development new variants.

If US could ship doses developing nations, infrastructure administer them, would ideal. I'd gladly put necessary booster continue near-lockdown practices (with exception go job) booster available me.

Unfortunately, that's case right may long time. Doses US wasted and/or expire every day, many developing nations yet ability store and/or administer vaccinations. changes, yes, I'll get booster.  1% population tested yesterday.

That's amateur numbers. Macau tested [literally population 3 days. may well, others much better. serving home bar year sales gone immensely idk boss bitching Boris co screwed hard unreal... piss away like $35 billion tracing app even work? believe US worried social political retaliation citizens. truly believe locked lot (stupid crazy) Americans would grab guns take streets.

That's right. full lockdown immediate mass testing entire sample. Singapore too. nuke entire district tests moment case happens, special location tracing apps it.

I’m trying find examples virus limited without sort intervention except vaccination (and vaccination level many places worst outbreaks low 25-30% so)

Personally, don’t know outbreaks south peak soon almost nothing stopping it. think there's intrinsic reason masking can't become new normal. 

Because masking indoors makes social activities nearly impossible. Try dating, dining drinking pubs masks on. completely uncomparable super mild restrictions airplane travel introduced 9/11. also means there’s demand better internet infrastructure, r/MunicipalFiber seeing increase attention everyone looking faster, cheaper internet …. Work, school, everything sure much SPIKE even 
  SPIKE changes

It's acronym. ""the spike protein"". Universal doesn’t mask mandate employees requiring wear front guests indoors. relying self-reported data. Look back EVALI shit see reliable is. 

Also probably discourage unvaxed getting tested. great idea, IMO. dataset includes delta variant. think there's difference protesting committing otherwise illegal acts. breaking windows part protest? get away guise protest? attitude isn’t. vaccinated population cases dont really matter. Deaths severe cases matter. sudden afford pay $15/hr

Not really option.

And agreed, good luck office. think we're typing we're working. Typing *easy* part. true killing host limiting factor transmission. 

Something like COVID long incubation/transmission period see sharp drop-off killing host. Consider COVID turned 99% fatal something, still maintained long period transmission without symptoms. Maybe potential infections would curtailed host dying, significant number compared many already infected prior symptoms/death.

So would guess, there's pressure AVOID worse fatality. there's also pressure become fatal. would unlucky coin flip, (many) mutations occur benefit limit organism, think increased fatality COVID would one case that. Anyone thought SARS-CoV-2 could eliminated time escaped China delusional.

The reality extremely contagious virus animal reservoirs massive portion world remains unvaccinated. simply way elimination ever going happen unless every single person every single country able indefinitely stay home vaccine could developed, procured distributed, completely untenable. trial also helps see different kinds kids different things show up. Kids risk getting covid. many situations risk low, abs need real careful understand risks vaccine children even pace slower want. definitely one size fits kind thing industries works lot better others. see shift recently far productivity goes? mean 15 years experience mostly time working home standard, like exception. would interesting see whether shifts becomes normal everyone learns deal it.    I’m sure data collection methods were, would point university faculty/staff vaccination rates usually 20% higher general public. work university system schools system 70+% vaccinated. (Which still embarrassingly low, it’s well average.)

Anecdotally, don’t know single PhD vaccinated. Granted, I’m STEM worker may well bias, don’t think it’s sharp given overall vaccination rate mentioned. There's specific citation, [having article discussing dangers increased transmissibility article written Alpha (B.117) first emerged.

The stylized, back envelope calculations: Delta R0 6 - 8. Original strain/Alpha say around 3. Delta also reproduces one less day, say, 3 days compared 4 days original strain. So, 16 days, 5 cycles Delta 4 cycles previous strain. unmitigated number looks like: 6^5 vs. 3^4, 7776 vs. 81. So, roughly time period, Delta produce almost 100 times cases. 

Of course, back envelope numbers stylized facts (i.e., there's obviously mitigation vaccination, prior immunity masking, etc.), show that, even Delta cause sickness per person prior strains, fill hospitals. Everyone may hospitalized prior strains spreading course couple months, shows hospital week two Delta. Tell African Americans women, would better luck getting right vote instead protesting posted Facebook. sounds like viruses sort sentience though, wants. Clearly case. guess like biological machines designed optimize self manufacturing.

That's interesting ... wondering sort collective conscience something, one french top specialists often refers virus ""getting smarter"", kinda confused me. Sorry confusion, misread vaccination info, actually says:

""All people **born 2007, 2008 2009 12 years old**, regardless insurance make appointment first vaccination dose...""

So 12 above, sorry mistake. Paywall didn’t read feel like applies whole country. Best luck! suspect deeper worries troubling mom vaccine, maybe also solved.

Many family want vaccine first (January 2021) time went everyone good experiences vaccine, got vaccinated protected. Wait ICU's 100% capacity. pretty clear micro biology class back day, it’s included curriculum; know people want believe want believe. unfortunately. soon “science skeptics” come severe COVID, do? Well, head right local hospital take full advantage doctors, diagnostic equipment, life saving procedures, therapies, ventilators, etc.. words, skepticism magically leaves brain, suck science like mo fo. good long time delta hit   20 year olds millennials... mom, nope, inlaws yep :p think standing large groups without masks vaccines incredibly infectious virus running rampant around city poor decision harmful wider community Sure we'll get right pal.  lol think would bit niche even Reddit. Although surprised before.  comment stickied top. even close. Basically happened NSW done really well previous outbreaks ending without resorting hard lockdowns. tried applying technique time work.

The real failure ultimately federal government slow vaccine rollout, though.   delayed purchasing bulk countries need got in.

God bless people PM Ardern. Seriously. often think entire world would quarantined 4 weeks early 2020 would saved many lives, dollars time, would much easier we’re dealing now... but, alas humans going human Millennials comfortable taking heroin vaccine.  unheard menstrual changes receiving vaccine. Science rich history poorly tracking women's responses medicine. So, discount part story.

Anecdotally, I've noticed difference too, positive one. irregular cycle, I've tracking phone calendar years, fell back line shortly receiving vaccine. past three months, fallen perfectly 28 days apart. know why. Maybe vaccine irrelevant. know body, also know science. would great effects recorded studied. good WiFi router faster Ethernet connections Vaccines panacea. Vaxx + mask + distance. non-essential things. day interruptions co-workers (no chat messages, calls, meetings), lot before?

So weird...there lot *more* interruptions - actually get Teams chatter - interruptions consequential. Like, I'm sitting typing co-worker comes in, plops desk, puts coffee (always bad sign) says ""So, getting new World Warcraft expansion?"". Welp, goes next 30 minutes. remember forgot walked in, etc.

I'm surprised people finding harder ask questions, issue. easier ping someone Teams rather walk way building/cubicle? Even COVID one-off questions came Skype. feel much easier option share screen say ""look this, what's going on?"".

I say thread really opened eyes *differently* WFH impacts us all. Things assumed universal are...not. really. Covid elimination real possibility appearance Delta. Now, much harder.

Wise up! 70% double dose vaccination rate

That number herd immunity assuming initial variant. Delta far infectious point herd immunity impossible, 70% target completely pointless. 

I guess new target enough vaccines everyone wants vaccinated.  memory correct outbreak spread every state/territory except possibly Tasmania NZ mean process get around adults approved emergency authorization. children thought wise? Yes, college may give option getting tested depart, that's also foolproof (false negatives, might rapid antigen test). sure hotels operating case there's another wave, I'll look it. We've managed COVID case home nobody else got it, couple weeks parents' second dose vaccines peak performance. still done hard lockdown. ""hard"" lockdown implemented working even hard. states stricter lockdowns. Propaganda serious issue. think people right protest government actions? sounds like Pfizer likely submit EUA 5-12 age group sometime September. application need reviewed (weeks/month). Moderna slightly behind Pfizer. taking longer expected FDA asked expand patient numbers trials couple months ago. mutates much can't bind ACE2 anymore, guess.

That's also line protection severe illness death remaining high Lymphocytes still able fight delta. I'll repeat school superintendents point. masks make difference. feel bad teammates I've left. Yeah oh well there's blokes worse positions moment, spat mum. good relationship disagreement, I'm sure we'll work out. Serious? That's like eons ago Delta time  Literally Ontario's cases climbing, around 500-700 per day. Population 82%/75% first/second doses, we've adding around 10 unvaccinated people per day ICU. provincial government sitting hands, coasting high vaccination numbers. Schools open September, we're going get worst couple weeks yet. counterargument I’ve often heard since SARS-CoV-2 long incubation period, potentially mutate become transmissible deadly, Bc doesn’t kill host right away lot spreading time host killed. Maybe looked suggesting pointless?

I'm Kiwi Australia essentially boat this. 

Both countries cases emergency use early start vaccinations. Neither mRNA production, Australia az production due clotting deaths rolled 60s.

Basically countries ended starting months later covid free first half year. catching quick overtake heap US states next 6-8 weeks.

Letting Delta go wild close reaching vaccination targets would huge mistake. heard rollout going well north. hope get things sorted soon, travelling back Germany seems many kinds wrong get vaccine.

Here random observations:

1. Everyone Nova Scotia wears mask public, even fully immunized
2. Public spaces promote social distancing - limited occupancy, restaurants tables spaced least 6' apart, people step sidewalk maintain space passing others, etc.
3. Nova Scotia low Covid rates, largely due rather aggressive public health policies. currently 41 cases 1 person hospital (population \~1M)
4. New Brunswick low Covid rates - 152 active cases, 1 person hospital (population \~0.8M)
5. Nobody Maine wears masks. stopped grocery store hard spot people masks. Maybe 1% people.
6. Public spaces Maine promote social distancing. Bars restaurants elbow-to-elbow
7. Maine currently 326 people ICU (population \~1.3M)
8. Massachusetts higher masking rates, maybe 5% saw. towns ordinances require masks town. social distancing promoted.
9. Massachusetts limits occupancy spaces, ineffectively. example, one retail store went maybe 1000 square feet floor space limited occupancy 72 customers.

I say kindest way, absolutely trivializing emotional pain. “the mean lady made get shot,” I’m talking true religious exemptions, Reddit doesn’t believe exist anymore. 

There’s reason religious freedom baked constitution. It’s important people health safety. Agree not, there’s many people would let kid die rather treat religion says (that’s separate legal matter vaccines, it’s taking healthcare another fold well, whereas vaccines, you’re protected whether neighbor vaccinated not.) aren’t deadbeat parents, would believe always case, many times it’s parents struggling hardest decisions life placing trust religion. Religion extremely important life support system many, trivializing country’s DNA, be. 

Again, I’m religious, got rid religious exemptions, wouldn’t affect one bit. However I’m still opposed. Religion deep part are, allowing freedom autonomy important.

As separate side not, vaccines, there’s multiple circulating. Real, authentic religious exemptions would probably apply subset, them, religious exemptions would likely get one vaccines. again, makes barbaric people advocating forcing vaccine someone religious objections it.

There’s already much commercial real estate space stays vacant year year. going happen, sure. there’s true solution place fallout it’s going noticed. 

Don’t get wrong. It’s kindness keep people obsolete jobs. I’m rooting Office Space bosses there. But, families feed, cover nut. 

I’m making people go back work forcing stay home. It’s really enraging corporations quickly figuring: “Hmm, moved BFE, Wyoming cost living affordable? informed financial move! Nothing like little snow around Christmas either, right? Well, certainly use San Diego level salary somewhere else company!”

Just wish we’d move toward solutions already choking problems five decades.

Instead remote workers threatened, corporate keeps profiting lot people aren’t monsters on-site supervisors idea long jobs last. Maybe already knew wouldn’t retire companies, least hoping squeak kids school. Leave remote jobs, see fast adapt fall.

Many people like working home even reduced paycheck.

I like Capitalism benefit workers instead corporations sometimes, one interesting scenarios. honestly matter deadly still able infect people develop serious symptoms. Delta Variant: *chugs beer crushes head* fuck I’m going No, end game. Covid still pose risk overwhelming health system cancel essential care. Thanks. :-) think there’s balance. companies strict people coming office. Sometimes need stay home, whether it’s days, maybe weeks, really fine home time.

But like pro-WFH folks don’t like idea forcing everyone work one style office, also don’t think would good everyone worked home. benefits in-person work, others. Long-term, people starting jobs, wanting network, ideate, in-person benefits. 

Also, things like traffic home prices gone even though WFH still prevalent, aren’t necessarily pros remote work. feel many WFH desires come issues commute workplace culture. Remote work still option, maybe issues addressed regardless, well. $150 urgent care house since network, big drug stores free appointments booked week out. Yeah Covid best thing ever didnt deal traffic anymore Huh... never thought that. Makes sense. point wearing makeup home wearing mask.

It takes one liar spread fact. absolutely overwhelming. agree felt like 90% sub. average person poorly informed clueless. rapidly evolving virus, top relatively poorly understood waves generated based societal restrictions behaviours.

[The U.S. “never going zero” new daily Covid cases - Dr. Scott Gottlieb, Former FDA country really wants continue zero covid, going China's way. They'd willing, able, run 30 million tests stamp ONE outbreak ONE city caused ONE infected person. they'd able willing every single city local transmission found, keep MONTHS instead days weeks.

My opinion unnecessary. IMHO, article minimizes fact breakthrough infections quite nasty. helpful. make sound like breakthroughs asymptomatic.

From experience, two vaccines June, two weeks ago came breakthrough case. felt like really bad cold lasted week. So, get zombie apocalypse dumbass apocalypse? human race doomed. Problem die going flare back up. NZ philosophy short sharp lockdowns rather restrictions long period time, economy performed well. Damn sucks:( move Norway! mom (in 70s) is. inlaws (in 60s) not. compare driving drunk. may hurt yourself, may hurt anyone else could end hurting lot people reason

That's ""freedom"" stuff joke.  ""free"" putting others risk.  

So boneheaded. time need work together common good.  

Now time come together face threat deadly virus.  need protect - help other.

We're task. got booster already myself. Went different pharmacy walk in.

I'm immunocompromised, obese, health conditions I'm 41. said fuck vaccine would end trash anyway. 

But yes course think developed/rich countries sending way doses Africa places. measures must become part culture. Otherwise make things unnecessarily painful ourselves

Personally, I'd much rather take slightly higher risk catching cold/COVID masking indefinitely. Same, too, social distancing. I'd expect folks same.

I'm removing social stigma masking existed pre-pandemic. certain point, ought recognize -- folks -- precautions taken past 1.5 years indeed sucked, shame people want eventual return normality really, Sars-cov-2 first virus infected bats. unfortunately can't find good sources it. see articles person interviewed usually stuff like ""I used able run miles. run 15 minutes get winded like months.""

I thought subreddit valued data anecdotal evidence/sensational headlines. Guess Americans truly high level heathiness.

Source? subjective. specific?

No one denies vaccines 100% effective, nothing is. effective according data, mention CDC. Got Pfizer booster yesterday J&amp;J jab got month ago, still alive. AMA largest city tested 15% population - satisfy you? Waste water tested country - it’s clear except Auckland Wellington. looking response cultural lens? suspect can’t wrap head around things country fucked up. Add millions tourists, immigrants, cross-border workers driving Canada Mexico flying elsewhere business. Vaccines come America! would pretty epic. Also outside America. wish numbers better worldwide, too. vaccine adoption rates Cuba? companies piece work, arent they? silver lining hes working home. Wonder would refused work 12 hrs days? places gone completely overboard. Restaurants every table. Disney betweens rows rides. Places put queues wrap. along COVID airborne air we're sharing anyway. gives droplets place stick.  Considering NZ island nation far fewer population. Base numbers don’t tell whole story. Though NZ’s far less partisan government also credit covid numbers well  luck get level infection wave passes. silver lining one much easier spread many anti-Vaxxers also anti-mask isolating sooner later many people left exposed immunity. hope people's immunity due direct exposure holds bit going get vaccine. Maybe bigger viral loads caused variant provoke hearty immune response original version caused. I'll biologist virologist though, best educated guess based info paired big dose wishful thinking. Well hit zero local cases today, numbers crashing downward last week. think employees choice working home. proven work either way.

The paradigm shift I’d really like see:

Refusal masses work 40 hours week, period. WFH blurred lines bad industry. working ever “before times.”

Mandate nothing 40. workforce demands could happen. use steroidal inhaler Singulair asthma read appear beneficial effect reducing symptoms plus side it. remember December got really sick mean cough lingered weeks. lot household fan also got sick people also weird lot. I'm thinking prob caught times I'd gone rave time. job 100% done home, sell physical building. wasting money space could used non-remote job.

It drives absolutely insane go job work 9-5 computer day come home over. home, get done perfectly, keep sanity waste time commuting, useless presentations could've Zoom call, etc... showing boss wants lord underlings person.

Personally, jobs done using PC remote out. get started school. get it, want kids social. Well sorry future youth riding bikes town, playing kick can, playing Manhunt (hide seek night), playing park. going happen due technology. 

If learning done remotely, IT. get started making us well rounded take electives ""Core"" classes college. hey, least know Mesopotamians.  OP absolutely right stating delta previous variants. Either get ""real serious"" spiral control. Real serious refers aggressive health department response needs still want maintain zero covid face delta outbreak.

448 cases may look like much compared average day Florida, traced back ONE person, took 2 weeks repeated mass testing, immediately quarantine infected individual, careful contact tracing stop outbreak. much effort previous variants COVID-19. 

For almost entire year, Vietnam, Australia, New Zealand able maintain zero covid right alongside China, able stamp isolated outbreaks within matter 1 2 weeks usually. delta came India, existing zero covid measures longer sufficient contain delta outbreaks. 

Vietnam averaging 10k cases 300 plus deaths day, hope eradicating outbreak. Australia getting towards 1000 cases day, likely able return zero covid. 

If country really wants continue zero covid, going China's way. They'd willing, able, run 30 million tests stamp ONE outbreak ONE city caused ONE infected person. they'd able willing every single city local transmission found, keep MONTHS instead days weeks. 

Yangzhou city mass testing like this. first delta case occurred Guangdong province back May, outbreaks leaked various provinces China, today first day 3 months China finally reported zero community transmission. took 3 months god knows many tests, almost negative, finally get delta outbreak control, that's now.

Given China do, New Zealand, delta cluster growing, also needs respond much aggressive earlier, want achieve zero covid again. difficult much transmissible delta variant.  end. pandemics end. Nope, China hit zero local cases today peaking around 100 cases day. whole cycle took 1 month outbreak discovered there.

Proportionally 990 deaths last week, 31. happening? 66% people Ontario fully vaxxed, 51% Florida is. 

That's insane, shows important every dose matters. southern neighbours guys take care other. hope get better soon. Interesting. bet right, provided still breathe adequately filter (and see reason think wouldn't). I'm assuming 2.5 particulate filters make put masks (I'm forgetting exact name) would work (and designed breathed through). Yup, even start, multiple people interior exterior doors, roped entrance side, people counter walked through, nothing actually done stop entering. 

Even variant, went back image maybe week best stopping again.

Any chance could dumb me? :) Black American, office hostile place me, WFH godsend. dont think matter. possible, computed cause definite exposure.  Vaccines enough, current level science. hoped would enough, including me. disappointed, hope stupid group admit virus well truly trumped vaccines. suspect health priority hmmmm- would want go bone town unvaxed person? would hard no. get vaxxed COVID, chances taking percautions regarding Sexually Tramsmitted Infections? Basically really bad choice sexual encounter. That's US population. US. don’t know specifics I’ve never written home office use, friends have, write work space utilities used. It’s formula based Internal Revenue Service understand. two doses pfizer pretty sure covid. nose beyond stuffed running time. Ive sneezing non stop. throat hurts mild cough feel weak. came really suddenly intense. can't express uncomfortable nose eyes feel pressure. Rapid test tomorrow scheduled. 
 34 y.o. female asthma recently began work Seattle area found ill suddenly after. end game masking, social distancing, contact tracing, that, said. addition advances medical science, measures must become part culture. Otherwise make things unnecessarily painful ourselves.

I get it, knee jerk reaction is, stuff painful wah wah wah. fact largely way already works much Asia, special precious selves can't recognize things good reasons? Anecdotal got delta fully vaccinated. Luckily nobody else infected. even unvaccinated wife. 
It shows shots help mild case (like cold week) infecting others. 17x lower would guessed.. point always protect staff behind barrier.  I'm expert, think really much guess that. Reinfections rare. Ones bad extremely rare reports seen involved someone immuno-compromised already. mild, getting bad reinfection unlikely think really say anything odds different variant. Last year, day Labor Day actually tentative return-to-work date. Fast forward year, day Labor Day year also one many return-to-work date. we're looking sometime next year. think COVID shown us (for jobs) unnecessary going work remote work perfectly fine That’s point. 1% tested, people still allowed go grocery stores instead staying fuck home. cases still increasing lockdown keep getting extended. Sorry, I'm sharpest tool shed--are implying even though bad, could worse weather cooler? seasons change get much worse? 😢😢😢 Good you. it, 3 / 2 (or 2 / 3 out) better you, better everyone else.  Saskatchewan dumb leader expected lot cases right province. wasn’t aware local channels “minds own” speak. Vaccination going well now, 1% population vaccinated day, rate US UK hit peaks. low vaccine hesitancy NZ supply finally arrived end July. like driving personally; enjoyable commute. Really problem commute *other people* people drive distracted, aggressive, without care others. Seeing people text drive daily occurrence. people roads, enjoy drive.  I’d hesitate say younger people susceptible. There’s evidence isn’t confounded. YES exactly this. I’ve always really valued separating work home life (I never worked bedroom college, never worked saturdays could help it). brain can’t prioritize things function correctly it’s together. 

I don’t mind talking people feel that!  It’s nice office yourself. enjoy company though, also live alone year especially mid pandemic it’s isolating. I'm Venice. know Huntington Beach doing? OC? Yes, univ require faculty/staff pay parking. It’s shitty. could possibly go wrong? Nationally, doesn’t look way, minimum slowdown states like California South. boss, care I’ll honest, love convenience working home. home chores errands everything else home. completely wrecked mental health, alone time. alone constantly anxiety ridden thoughts become biggest nightmare. Yes, 2 4 family, two different states, tested positive Ellume becore gathering. Caused lot anxiety delayed plans. PCRs we’re negative. I’m one people. commute distance overwater, drive wrangler doors off, killer system listen music love. 

And line work, networking site pivotal advancing. prefer socialize work get want be.

I want able stay home work that’s want. I’m saying “fuck people” want work home. Maybe try directing anger towards management insist bringing employees back office instead workers simply prefer work site.  already see sizable group won’t cooperate. Covid mutated lethal SARS evaded vaccine current western society would end know countries. rich would flee NZ island nations. US would probably fracture different regions based virus containment. 

China East would go back Wuhan lockdown focus surviving. I've always thought whole ""70% vaccinated herd immunity"" arbitrary nonsense, guess serves purpose perceptible benchmark.

Everything ultimately comes minimizing deaths global scale, think. Even though individual countries lulls cases, never really collective control worldwide. Bottom line need get vaccines countries. hate driving. gone hit run (minor bender, upsetting still). next job WFH. accountable remote?

It's easier pretend work one checking tickets, deadlines, ..KPIs sort? Daily standups, needed something show?

yes, people tended exceed minimums, rode line instant one looking slacking agree value random interactions. people appreciate workplace culture. feel sorts random interactions worth costs. Especially job requires complex thought. Small interruptions result major losses productivity. Like asked random question trying big math problem. brain kind flubs. 

The point is, distractions places, workplace distractions far better homeplace feel like describing failure management, problem working remote general.

Everything blamed management net cast wide enough, point noticed since X, noticed drop productivity. Since stopping X, saw go back up, million different reasons could case, easiest effective thing definitively prove something else effective stop X, working home. Agree  said it, me. agreed.

But yeah...

Fuck. 1% population tested yesterday. percent day before. 

Level 4 means stay fuck home. Nothing open (except groceries medical). deliveries. take outs. 

If anyone chance figure us. 

And shouldn’t speak things know nothing about. Taiwan major Alpha outbreak. Delta appeared toward end already lockdown spread. China managed stop Delta outbreak size. I'm pretty optimistic NZ.  second breakfast? Guess should’ve clarified cannot *all* work home. 50/50 lab/home. Go it! way right way opposition consists dangerous irresponsible people"" says Canadian politician.

Yes.


I'm sorry, we're trying witty? Sarcastic? said fact.

Yes, opposition consists dangerous irresponsible people. people darndest stop masking public spaces, social distance. reason got asked work home people would get jealous. basically everybody's life suck much worst job's apparently.  Social media control ingest, really. Facebook Twitter stuff feed full unrelated bullshit rather recent posts people follow. Reddit double-edged sword front, mods control huge chunk content given sub, posts comments. subscribed list well-moderated, great experience. not, get sorts insanity come through. necessarily true. speak, scientists working towards “pan-coronavirus vaccine” capable handling SARS-CoV-2 variants, coronaviruses well single vaccine.

Here’s [one recent article it’s still early stages, multiple entities around world working idea recent breakthroughs increasingly confident it’s possible.

It may true “eradication” level goal far greater suppression today. it’s HR SO’s work planet saved plague? I’m trying difficult. zero exemptions entire planet mandated take vaccine. Otherwise we’ll never rid scourge. Religion go hell far I’m concerned ;) soon may longer true. fine.  Floridian headline hilarious. mean working person lol Thanks comment police telling I'm allowed comment. One local High Schools sent 300 home due exposed. There's 4000 students there. quit, quit. clear, I'm referring people eligible Covid vaccine refuse get one. [Kraków, numbers less important knowing came from. Right still mystery cases, spread happening largely within households already known exposed. able link cases clearly spread outside Auckland Wellington (with Wellington cases clearly linked 4 people known exposure sites Auckland). different Sydney Melbourne many cases unlinked. Tons, according Facebook page. outside, still, assume lots travel happened.  Yeah I’ve noticed lot people Vaxxed around gotten colds nasty stuff (I assume wearing masks little told didn’t to). swollen glands sore throat like could anything covid?! tested negative. Guess I’ll always assume every illness get covid too. absolutely positive flu  something kinda like already. super infectious get demand free, gives mild zero chance killing causing long-term complications. protects dangerous strains. forget called though.  Overwhelming majority workers private room absolutely loving wfh. yah ""management"" thinks different offcourse. well bad planet - plastic. much already :( 

And tiny part problem weird get upset about.  bosses watch Air?   answer ever look Alabama? Fox local channel, cable Fox News. makes sense.

More infected = chances mutate.

The best way killed COVID... get COVID. Vaccines help they're like getting disease without getting sick it. Yeah course strict policy people position can't anything me. goal move another department policy lease again, accept job somewhere else. I'd probably get money jumping ship, I'm starting get tired hopping around company pretty OK otherwise. co milking can. job search taken 8 months long! Also, might worth considering job w less pay less hours. divide commute time + work hours salary might get nasty surprise. Work life balance would optimal w work home even lower salary. Meanwhile, company made us come back October last year everything worst area…. don’t care. still think “if can’t see you; you’re working”. Seriously, would worry employers? spend less rent employees generally happier. hoteling model come time time totally viable maintain location face face work.

A friend manages large team says metrics show people taking fewer sick days without drop productivity. 

The people worried commercial real estate. *now*, eventually. pay park work? Wtf that’s socialist government handout person responded straight saying 'I want people forced back office benefit'

What's difference ""I want people go office work home, *my benefit*""? Yes, cases still rising whole month now. Whatever they're seeing, real effect. No, it’s opposite.

A layer almost always underbill unless they’re trial senior partner.

The lower rank law underbill, gradually bill high proportion get better. logic junior takes four hours complete task senior associate could two, it’s unfair client bill four hours junior basically gets paid 50% work. get better experience gradually bill higher proportion work. Florida anti-vaxxer state? they'll move registered headquarters Delaware Insert-Tax-Haven-Here past week, I'd say 70%+ people saw maskless. Finally started seeing masks come back got groceries week, still half, summer. Anything worries bosses makes happy Flidiots  contained Auckland currently

Like lot shit things :-D realize people calculating second derivative 7DA cases seeing slow right? It’s literally observation happening. This. Please someone give us peace mind. ventilators vaccines back then. entirely caused poor management, fact work online. There's much wrong post much unpack.

Just know us done this. We've gotten shots want live lives. specifically said makes life better via less traffic accountable remote? tickets, deadlines, ..KPIs sort? Daily standups, needed something show? 

I agree value random interactions. people appreciate workplace culture.  feel sorts random interactions worth costs. Especially job requires complex thought. Small interruptions result major losses productivity. Like asked random question trying big math problem. brain kind flubs. much overhead adding people talk last night sports game pretend reddit finding pointless busy work someone who's gotten work done got caught reddit? ... smallish pro several big cons. 

Ultimately, feel like describing failure management, problem working remote general. not-yet-peer-review pre-print terrible NG article problematic (no quantifications) Dr Daniel Griffin emailed one author (David H. O’Connor) apparently, agrees look providing quantifications.

This discussed [TWiV Professor Racaniello Dr Griffin agreed there's much conclusion comes pre-print. threads people actually enjoy 1 hour round trip commutes that’s socialize… people work.

Fuck people. I’ll never work office full time again.  prices skyrocket newfound revenue workers-from-home (and also game town, everyone else shut down)  “Worrying bosses”. Why? Afraid improving employees lives? Fuck next? Free healthcare sick days living wage?  Delta variant praxis Nope. honest. People chosen live grid generations. one forced partake society, choice. 

Hell, needed immunization records go school Reagan President. even then, mother made choice; wasn’t forced. Could’ve homeschooled instead. exactly adding list it’s approved different cocktail people getting years? see wearing mask inside giant intrusion living normal life.

That rhetoric harmful. Also wrong. wear mask 30 minutes week grocery store sure, people get work home. forgot one - massive waste time spent chit chatting desk. 

I sat across dude verified actively medicated ADHD. He’s take medication holidays decrease dependence, also due massive cost… he’d save really needed knew project coming. 

During holiday times, I’d unwillingly endure talking upwards half day more. knew disease process, attention deficit issues got thorough workout attempting totally tune talked … pretty much anything. mentality ""when"", demand work home. Wait, why? Beyond lab, spend almost work time writing analysis? able lot job home, no? Yes That’s never going happen. always variants lower efficacy vaccines. never going prevent infections. Shouldn’t end game get point hospitalizations deaths manageable, consistent level? specifically point link cases hospitalizations nearly broken? ever find super infectious mildly symptomatic strain, try get people purposefully infected it? mentality ""when"", demand work home. Vaccinated people need care spread, too. Breakthrough cases frequently extremely unpleasant, vaccinated people hospitalized even die. Vaccinated people also need hospitals open capacity _other_ medical needs community - surgeries, emergency care, etc.

We get decide we're ""done virus"". Pretending serious problem exist ignoring hoping go away never worked history humanity. need actual solutions let us reclaim much normalcy possible.

""Be done COVID"" option that's available. either take control situation reopen carefully terms, suffer consequences virus running roughshod entire community. went 2 weeks hell. Hang there, get better. young. Really?

Fuck. ☹️ work shipping department $3.16b net worth auto parts company outside Nashville, TN. We've going sort grievance since beginning pandemic. choice show up, person. could get paid covid leave (due symptoms, contact tracing, etc) applied 2 weeks year, otherwise unpaid. take covid leave, use vacation time, unpaid time off, ""take point"". Wild times. “aggressive policies” likely saved thousands lives. assholes correct. Companies going realize need chiefs waste money. That's worried. Like Quentin Tarantino movie. I'm neighbor side. makeup routine changed. Instead foundation need bit concealer. add bronzer, eyebrows lip balm I’m good zoom call. don’t need heavy makeup zoom calls- good lighting. truly shutdown country like, three weeks, maybe

That's literally what's fucking happening. I’ll play ball 🤣🤣 say bottom fifth? It’s okay lie brain doesn’t implode.  may true, also enormous scientific advances international cooperation needed come breakthrough vaccines treatments. Globalization may helped pandemic spread faster, also going help us get it. That’s 1 million Indian style comma separators.  possible evolve deadlier. Ebola HIV followed paths. much unlikely sure. What's answer?  Yeah, no. couple studies published since CDC reversed mask mandate confirming data set used claim indeed TL;DR summary Yeah guy proven fucking clue he's talking about. DeSantis really racking kills. He’s Taliban hero. suggests read article didn’t process saying Good. I’m effective job home, start stop used take 10 hours (commute + work) takes 5. We’ve meeting lunch month socialize bit amongst team, yeah, I’m never working full time office again. here. I’d quit immediately manager wasn’t me. She’s able cut much bullshit reaches peak started though, believe 50% fully vaccinated. deaths people got sick weeks ago, closer beginning vaccination levels lower. Good. worry them, work home increase productivity ? Since travel time essentially inexistent ?

I'm assuming fields benefit bosses want keep eye employees jesus please tell work beneficial company cause want drive work twice week lol last point spot on. People want join team. talent internally much easier come by. everywhere, really. Eventually enough people (pretty much everyone) immunity either vaccination infection, Covid become endemic. it’ll still around, everyone sort immunity, won’t now. aspect, much like flu, hopefully like common cold. given everyone who's risk access vaccine (kids extremely low risk severe outcomes including long covid) cares spread?

Covid endemic. virus never done us. must decide done virus. Show link ""said Israel findings"" I'll show used PCR. PCR measure viral RNA, fact. frustrated years ago numerous movements across nation raise teacher pay K12 teachers, never even came much adjuncts treated like dirt, even though make majority (or close to--I forget specific numbers) teaching force higher ed. unsustainable leads drastic decrease quality education (adjuncts teach ridiculous amount courses teach survive).

Your mileage may vary locked everything less day submitting resignation--3 business hours actually. access records, LMS, instructional material, email--nothing. still *their* property apparently care about. (Those Academia might think SOP--it's not) don’t think really capacity test strict enough measures get control point. could see COVID awesome someone already SO/spouse kids yet. one kindergarten 2nd grade hit virtual hybrid school (on zero notice) kids young trying work home complete nightmare. Things got little better kids finally person everyone happier now, man rough first year. could also see people partner frustrated losing time covid spending much time home alone back lockdown phase.  Lol, realize networking always huge right? 

And condescending attitude you’re displaying here, I’m sure people didn’t bug much don’t seem life party. opened opportunity dump company near 15 years. 

They treat employees like numbers, don’t care big picture, refuse hold anybody accountable, refuse give raises, promotions thing, giving ppl shit they’re trying use PTO, etc. 

But stayed bc didn’t want move family away friend’s family locally. 

I started working new company thing. PTO isn’t quite nice, 30% raise, &amp; already received continuing education class former job refused give bc costs money. new job willing makes much better employee. Abe another scheduled later year. 

I’m honestly astounded dumb enough stay long former place point.  Remember flu killed 1500 ppl week August? Send anyone says mortality rates same. SMH I’m pretty sure got Covid March. Felt really fatigued, slight tremors, positive EBV (mono) even though 20years since I’d ( EBV reactivation linked Covid) curiosity lung symptoms we’re offered monocolonal antibody Paywall much? wedding videographer. go 2 3 indoor weddings virtually every week (in New Jersey). fully vaccinated co workers still trucking along. masks seen weekends. What's man?  dunno chill need adapt move elsewhere. people going town they'll still near town center. re-villagification society. going much economically viable open restaurants places near city centre. people working home would love able go great restaurant knocking work. don’t think ever look cruise holiday option pandemic. 

The fact elderly people would risk little time left get cruise ship midst pandemic mind boggling.

Save hard earned retirement money secluded upscale resort food better health risks minimal. He's big guy...  things bad saying starting immediately imposing restriction restriction.

I think quite overestimate political capital available muster tight restrictions again.

I also believe KB fortitude things.

Lastly, worst areas state ones comply restrictions begin with. says correlate viral RNA infectiousness mean can't infectious. test measuring Viral RNA. said Israel citing vaccinated unvaccinated similar viral loads. showing nothing said. I'm pretty sure transitioning ""but cases peaking, we're downslope"" now.

Which may even true, depressingly predictable. lifelong friendships business references working people office. sounds great maybe young still touch school/university people social life. Even offices move WFH seems great, coworkers area, already closer bonds knowing in-person, even video seems bit fun.

Well, time, workers come go, fewer fewer new hires ""local"" you. Though social ""zoom meetings"", impact. past 6 years I've worked either remotely, large part team remote, COVID start me.

As I've noticed, almost nobody keeps touch changing jobs remote teams. Apart perhaps reference job application, little zero contact. long term friendships, long term anything. Sure, sometimes someone would move new job, might chat quite bit, talk things, usually fizzle zero rather quickly. However, plenty friends held decades gained working together person. still go hang, talk voice chat, play online in-person games, grab drinks see show. remote people ""Chicago Team"" job five years ago, struggle remember names now.

Long term, probably damage cities urban centers. Think rise automobile massive efficient highways created suburban sprawl? Hold beer new WFH economy. continent likely become coast coast suburbs neighbors tall fences hardly know other. okay, watch movies home. watch sports home. see concerts home. groceries delivered. Fine dining, driving service bring food local restaurant, really exists. Perhaps Taco Bell now? Welcome home, prison.

I can't wait downvotes here. almost smell them. course saying might completely come be, without doubt, strong possibility.

I guarantee first taste 100% remote working seems great now, long term, unintended consequences fully considered. time consequences strongly realized, would probably impossible go back office, least long uphill battle. one wait go back office here? (In past, company work ~~at~~ shut offices everyone gone remote indefinitely)

(Maybe I'm 34 living parents) Yes, technology resources white collar workers better quality life. use EVERYONES advantage? Within-trial decisions always used running clinical trial: Superiority proven, unethical keep controls blinded. regressed companies government weren’t liable pay people quarantine. Unsurprisingly people need get paid chose report symptoms get tested all. Funny enough people got crushed iceberg titanic attraction pigeon forge couple weeks ago. Lol *awful* respiratory illness late December 2019 lasted around 7 days. Shortness breath, cold symptoms, fever, could barely walk bathroom. still think Covid influenza. Passionate corporate-speak.  Underrated comment Omg, hear phrase one time... Great point.  Shirt sales go up. I’m almost exactly like right older ones pushing office newish “level” worrying outcomes. 

It’s pretty funny ask senior leaders need others come back outcomes drives up, don’t want say don’t trust people.

But hey, makes easy pull talent others don’t trust people, ironically drives outcomes even MORE. year shit year since boss quit December, inherited work, got title pay (this year, *apparently*) he's working home, he's able delegate team, get assistance, get done time he'd otherwise spend commuting able maintain semblance work life balance.


He's actively looking work elsewhere whole situation bullshit he's taken advantage of.  It’s cause middle management can’t justify jobs anymore don’t workers loom office setting monitor. I'm sure she'll get booster shot, said seeing anyone Delta gone. Got third modern dose today. flu shot. arm pissed. Disappointed Tim Apple boomer hard headed ways. Apple products stagnated innovation. work small company announced “working office considered norm” June. senior staff still working home whenever want junior staffers following lead, I’d say half us show two days week average. Forever ~~Wakanda~~ masks I'm south Puget Sound, get 10 minutes town see mask. Everyone outside Olympia every direction maskless. Ramping quickly. contractors, painters anyone home reno constructions.

lol. areas surrounding large cities Western WA generally fine. diligent Seattle Bellingham reasonably well vaccinated. eastern WA that's messing case numbers. time zone difference US India bit nightmare getting teams produce incredibly difficult. Nevermind quality products usually come door well.

Its called screensharing whiteboarding tools computer. works wonders. Matter fact, get tablet pen, simulate experience everyone HD.  harder it’ll management justify issue hospitalizations overtaxed medical system. hairdresser, tell I've seen make sales completely fall off. Shampoo conditioner pretty steady already encouraging guests wash hair less use dry shampoo help hair health anyways. I've proud many guests twice week washings. specialize ""wash go"" nice looking haircuts. result, guests found go many months without cut still look pretty darned good. sales styling balms beach texture sprays gone way up. easy products allow quick application look little pulled together ""done"" without undone. noticed guests see lot less. gentleman would come every two weeks coming every four four week people extending eight. killed income first. making $70k taxes went $22k first year back. I've recovered bit picking many new people room book before. like new people works well. I'm sure long take fully recover financially though. But, lost! got work two days week summer 2020 result, spent much time kids chilling beach wonderful time them. reasons think office helped?

accountability slacking fewer distractions, weight attributed office actually way distracting.

we see value workplace distractions whereas homeplace distractions tend far less value, interrupted mid 'work' workplace constructive job builds interaction employees. lot people keep saying push back office middle management can’t micromanage annoying wfh. absolutely greedy companies I’m surprised aren’t happily ending leases getting rid borderline useless people bloated salaries.   Okay  like tried similar naming COVID honestly...you need make flow well discussion  1% chance dying COVID? I'm healthy I'm worried it.

Under age 40, without comorbidities, probably far far less 1% chance dying COVID. Even vaccinated.  Yeah makes sense older population know guidelines reporting CDC changed basically *any* hospitalizations people covid get counted towards numbers. f really knows lol. That's way pay grade. point breakthrough infections exist people still spread manner important. also important distinguish breakthrough generality.. Sounds like asymptomatic people can't transmit, that's good least. sick stay home, that's always good advice even pre-covid.   Agreed. That's definitely possible. Maybe also consider industry work - people might able work home (effectively) one reason another.

Tbh, though, coworkers friends know less 10 would rather go back office way pre-pandemic. Restaurants, bars, clubs, birthday parties, school/classes, church, festivals, etc. things make life less bland contribute happiness   Reminds two weird Looks like resistance COVID spikes!  plenty conservative seniors fully vaxxed Southern/Midwest states. That's they're dropping like flies. They're content seeing younger GenX alt-righters go full crazy wind ER, library floors waiting Regeneron shot. ehr mah gherd! comirnaty! looking forward going back, personally, need separate spaces work life home life. also miss social aspects actually person. know many disagree sentiments, that's fine, I'm certain plenty people thinking like here. majority (but means all!) us work circle felt like rug abruptly pulled us weeks back delayed reopening.

I definitely crave old normality, doubt it. knocked ass ~48 hours nothing else report. breath mouths, what's difference. guess wrong. already saying people vaccinated require booster shots. soon tracking/mandating well? Sorry ignorance use already? least Europe?  New mainstream public medicine vaccine need re-approved new variants. vaccine altered better protect variants would need approval. imagine review process would quicker.  me. say miss cubicles thing

Here, think 5-6 years since every office turned nightmare ""open offices""

At least cubicles expectations privacy concentration. open offices edge 100% time everyone talking around able seen everyone time Dude, entire thread response parent comment nothing ""spread"" exclusively whatsoever. short term may considered benefit then, unvaxxed / ""forced"" stay home. long game, companies going tolerate forever.

My guess that, larger companies, phase one getting vaccinated people back office done, phase two might ""get vaccinated job eliminated six months"". mean, case point. Get naty lite  think his/her sentence good now, regarding double negative. re-read phrase times reason, maybe wording or, Monday... Everybodyyyyyy!   aware, episode predates pandemic covid vaccine. making fun ""autism caused vaccines"" anti-vax movement. Cartman afraid vaccine would make ""artistic"".

It's sad long people making bullshit vaccines. got jnj minor pain near abdomen week good. really sure jnj cause heard could blood clot. least actually know problems addressing them, one day time. think millions a) never escape b) never identify much less address problems.    Comirnaty?? consult name? 

Pfizer: listen Snoop Wire need name lets people know theyre helping community.

Snoop Wire: comirnaty? 

Pfizer: brilliant.  Queue uneducated people thinking looks much like comorbidity take it. Vax, Vax Clortho. Keymaster Tozin. Dis interview boss again? sure interview me! one study like can't find now. concerned healthcare workers getting tested regularly, could actually tell someone covid free not. Several clusters symptoms similar among two group (I think stress-related ones), others not. IIRC common clusters occurrence rates like 20%+.

This kind study easy know someone never covid without regular testing? Maybe companies started vaccine drives work. Vaccine pink slip? choice. fundamental level, humans biological predisposition reproduce. pandemic, especially one fairly low mortality rate, significant impediment procreation. Humans kept babies Plague, World Wars, etc.  That's terrible name. Better get IMO share sweet sweet antibodies baby. 

Your doctor may request get TDaP booster pregnant reason. Yeah, oppose mandates. really call new though.  FBI treating fake cards criminal offense, need bit enforcement. thought old people dribble lot! COVID vaccines, treatments, tests used Emergency Use Authorization FDA whatever health agency allows use full approval. EUA drugs vaccines still go rigorous review process yet approved. Pfizer's vaccine made jump EUA approved.
 Yes. produced globally  slight side effects second moderna shot yesterday feel right rain today 👍buying waterproof plastic cover vaccination card. guys get fully vaccinated flairs? talking me?


*No, son's name also Joey Jo-Joe Jr Shabadoo* ... anti-vaxxers feed switched ""... average time takes approve 10 years!"" 

Oh. Yeah? 

Let's forget ongoing pandemic killed almost five million (probably way more) human beings year ten years could be, what, 30-50 million? Anyway. So. long take approve ""essential oils"" sell website? Shoulda Vaxxie McVaxFace. expert panel National Institute Disaster Management (NIDM), Ministry Home Affairs (MHA), warned third wave Covid-19 may peak October.  recent report Prime Minister's Office (PMO), committee sought better medical preparedness children might similar risk adults I'd get vaccine suppository! I'm still little confused approvals work different vaccines. 

If Pfizer one fully approved, means companies, governments, etc. mandate little legal recourse, mean people got Moderna/J&amp;J? companies/governments mandating Pfizer vaccines only?

I guess really big issue Moderna probably getting full approval soon, still curious.  purpose people would keep calling Pfizer vaccine.  Mass high vaccination rate reporting 30-40% new cases vaccinated individuals. I’m sure people like cause this. Breakthroughs rare uncommon. latest science support fact vaccines going end pandemic. Vaccines protecting loved ones serious illness. wrong? walk 12 miles day, I’m young, healthy. limit contact others, social distance, wear mask. What’s deal? rare, official policy. Imagine thing knew US extreme cases police violence, thought that's everyday life like everyone country. That's bit citing people getting welded apartments like.  Deciding wait approval waiting approval changing mind. here, department record billings since pandemic started. really worried we'd hit targets, instead we're smashing every month.    got moderna, mean? get pfizer also? Excited new excuse people ""waiting FDA approval""   poll says otherwise, maybe it’s different attitudes different places? Yeah sounds like something get lil bit fucked bonus Many people enlist military option. *sorts controversial* Yes. medication could like that. guess comes fact prescription medication advertised US, seems really weird pointless me. maybe even harmful considering many medications marketed “non-addictive” alternatives turned bad worse. grew deep south much I'd like closer extended family can't children growing environment. SIL NY married progressive southern man still live think realizes what's store kids.  hope people rein desire hassle masked. us can't risk getting anything (incl. covid) medical reasons. would really great could like Asian countries nobody raises eyebrow masked, instead making big Karin/Kevin stink somebody else wearing one. Before, people might looked weird, became political thing, people act like killing pets. Big companies like Microsoft already mandated weeks back...  *did* control year half. I'm sure think inevitable. Australia NZ small outbreaks gotten handle every single one them, someone threw away playbook.    ask job is? would much like minimally intensive repetitive detail-oriented job lol Deleted instant even particular party mostly fault. delta variant particularly aggressive, unfortunately, studies vary vaccine's effectiveness new strain. Vaxxed people definitely getting hospitalized it, though. Getting shot(s) silver bullet. really still need mask indoors socially distance. forget valid point Walmart never enforced rule, PR. someone door offer people masks, NEVER turned maskless person away; said mask offer employee let in, that.

More gentle mask suggestion, really. added links comment above. 

If time, also recommend watching [this It’s 30 minute presentation head [Vaccine Research Mayo Clinic. came across video sub earlier today, it’s persuasive argument vaccinations I’ve seen. 

Specifically, Dr. Poland says starting [24m, 55 seconds explains everyone get vaccinated stop spread. following slide (about HEROES study UK) touches well.  bet it'll move needle

I see there.... huh? literally first world/highly vaxxed countries lockdowns -None EU Canada. Australia /NZ ones stage. everywhere else everyone 12+ given opportunity get vaccinated onus people refuse it. Lol going create account called COVID-19 say gained sentience, apparently account already exists... ^ Another alt account calling people ""mate"" ""yank"" racist post history, much guns anti-mask. Hmm. Premier Saskatchewan continues nothing, life pretty much back normal. Events happening every week. Crowds people back. know going bad gets better. spike protein enables virus infect cells allegedly can't mutate much without impairing infectiveness. mRNA vaccines specifically target spike protein - theoretically less able mutate way nullify vaccine. I'm glad parents vaxed. Eradication point. virus already endemic. vaccines decrease impact lives health.  spike site mutations occur. plenty ways virus mutate could significantly impact virulence transmissibility. want COVID end, course, I’d like us thrive conditions could allowed without guilted it. realize much better mental health minimal obligations much time focus interests. masking, social distancing, contact tracing, that. single magic bullet, even would bad idea sit wait arrive. Also, need effective treatment addition prevention. matter science. Wife’s coworker family member admitted hospitals couple towns city doesn’t beds left. arrived there, told actually lucky, day send someone NEW MEXICO, that’s closest bed was. TX near Louisiana border…. shitshow need 6 months safety data. Indonesia checking here. question whether cases dropping question declining testing, pretty clear really happening, add us list.  one knows I'm talking about. thought MRNA vaccines like 99%+ effective hospitalization death? seem consistent data.

Would’ve expected like 100x likely. really something watch. Trump Florida 300,000 2020. deaths unvaccinated older folks primarily lean conservative. Chipping away 1,000 votes week make harder harder hold onto Florida. Yes, definitely different strategy NZ high vaccination coverage. I’m hopeful increasing vax rates NZ Aus get soon (which certainly zero Covid it’s definitely low-Covid approach) Delta seemingly infectious manage nothing, even lockdown measures. Hoping best guys! looked state. moment work I’ve done past 10 years site inspection work. 

Transitioning working home would require complete career change. open to. Trying understand point. suggesting equivalence covid universal vaccination flu vaccination?

From recent reports picture emerging covid vaccination still contagious flu without vaccination. Covid still spread people get symptoms. quick death helps reduce spread there’s little pre-symptomatic/asymptomatic spread. People might take precautions that’s even certainty. Experts find Covid-19 role development functional neurological disorder Grocery Outlet bargain No, really not. Anything 4k mediocre now, look better even streaming 1080. states australia squashed delta belive. lockdown hard early like NZ done. high counts go covidiots open eyes ???? Damn simplest theory: pure Vanity. American Vanity. like go church learned nothing.  haven’t published yet….. Exhalation valves. added sources comment above. Soon Singapore done well, zero covid goal anymore like NZ, strategy different. Also Singapore much, much higher rate vaccination already mass masking, couple big advantages.  boss sort rushed us back missed camaraderie liked everyone office. Luckily realized overly optimistic mostly transferred completely back WFH. feel hope get back preferred workspace! *working remotely company wants 3 days office 2 days home (being Monday Friday). bought house outside city love working home. forced live city, home would’ve much smaller commute… honestly bad. It’s 50 minute train ride home office I’d take working home DAY. like able walk outside home chores meetings rather aimlessly walk around office faking small talk coffee machine ""I needed vacation place earth vacation"" thing summer, happens winter level infection mixed seasonal flu's. hospitals able cope without need lockdown? cycle stop Kinda cold-virus challenge. Ppl helped science studying immune system purposely get infected virus.  Yep, someone doctor's note saying cannot vaccinated, excluded 20% limit cap. Wish Costco reintroduces it? Even big city SoCal, Costco full unmasked folks, probably 75%. Agreed vaccinated (and CDC recommends wearing masks too), odds 50% care. expect cases increase next week so. People identified contacts allowed leave homes, positive cases transferred isolation facilities, deal lockdown fatigue many places around world. We're good position get control. Laughs ""Brazilian""

580K deaths, 20M cases see LinkedIn like every day. mad. Oh well. people still productive WFH, NEED bring back office. haha 4k way kill   Catholic Church already denying exceptions  Hehe hi fellow research scientist :) travel 85% job 15% I’m home valuable me. I’ll support WFH forever!! agree. Traffic still absolutely terrible, yet Reddit comes across everyone working home. I'm sure seeing roads. Yay. Yeah. Kinda like they’re saying maybe shouldn’t sending kids school without masks running around like pandemic over. Everybody tired fighting guard down. 

If you’ve ever exercise situation person leading class says “okay 20 push-ups we’re done” keep saying 19, 19, 19 20 turns 35. That’s what’s happened close end we’re it’s shitty. 

The virus doesn’t know shitty care holidays friendships. replicates someone’s body they’re unlucky enough get exposed don’t mount good immune response. 

The good thing know need fight it. bad thing is, nobody willing put inconvenience politicians don’t balls really unpopular things done protect people really. it’s enough numbers keep going up. Delta needs taken lot seriously. Good! Utility costs working home tax deductible Australia. there? Maybe look it? states laws regarding religious exemptions required childhood immunization school, assume would apply procedures Covid vaccine mandated. religious exemptions uncommon, less 4% children religiois medical exemptions combined think. Getting level vaccination would great. Maybe reduce hospital loads reminding people many different chemicals, nano-bots, government control drugs administered IV arm. one shot, pump full anything want! sleeping belly beast go hospital. Stay away! clarify, live Orange County, California. probably shouldn’t characterized way I’d reserve sundown town Mississippi.

While state responded pandemic degree seriousness, least relative much country, I’m surrounded suburban Karens sheriff publicly proudly announces won’t enforce mask mandates. We’re certainly San Francisco.

Honestly, truly children incapable affected Covid, like continue collectively believe based I’m witnessing, I’d fine. Unfortunately… don’t buy idea low death rate means we’re liberty ignore kids. doesn’t kill absolutely make stronger. hope made feel better! :) could still go sideways schools open, we're hanging far initial rise think people taking seriously happened last winter. Starting work fully in-person school couple weeks. Rural county thankfully school mask mandate place. Got $95 worth KNs coming get booster beyond.

Yea. going civil war enough people start dying. break variant kills lot vaccinated, going huge amount resentment easily boil over. 


When lose job, loved ones, kids, becomes really easy hit streets start smashing. American Society End.. lots ways mutations occur unrelated spike protein potential significantly impact transmissibility virulence. idea spike mutations making breaking thing come from, anyway? Employers obligation provide safe workplace employees. vaccines shown safe - diseased asshole spraying aerosols immunocompromised mother decidedly safe. One, takes time seek less deadly mutation trough, two, percentage kills would quite bit larger effect selective pressure similar changes infection. week testing 1% per day 350,000 people. That's fuckload people literally Taiwan. alpha outbreak. moment wuhan reported cases, Taiwan forced everyone wear masks. Delta biggest outbreak.

The rest inbound travelers failed quarantine traced properly  Uh, gonna die lol. point Delta treated like flu, deadly, worse long term effects, 4-7 times infectious spreads asymptomatically.

*unless vaccinated. depends entirely disease progresses. becomes deadly killing higher % people infected, kill significantly faster, still would little selection pressure covid usually 12+ day affair, many people get sick enough seek care around 7+ days, huge chunk people asymptomatic. Ever since pandemic started, better able organize time responsibilities, even parents (who travel work) noted decrease overall traffic drastically lessen usual stress getting work time.

So far mostly heard people benefited pandemic micro-scale, although could issues area education pandemic negatively influence. See, headlines like part problem. 

They IMPLY connection, go read article, isn’t one. 

A lot people don’t even read past headlines. 

It’s almost like intentionally trying undermine trust vaccines. perspective, that's par Germany Austria.  Right ya. Save $300 month gas tolls. 2-3 hours commute time, blessed witness baby's firsts everything. first crawl, first words, first step. Take 15 minute break play peek-a-boo life amazing. wife daughter even work hours work eat lunch time... Meaning better productivity.

Edit: also first time years gotten sick someone work... many people go closed office spaces sick spread germs.

#RegularizeWFH  Managers exist seen. Take away becomes obvious useless are. Hm. somewhat see point. least regards hospital resources important driver vaccination. stuff debate, unfortunately. There’s lot don’t great data for. studies cited regarding vaccinated carriers lot problems them. conclusions drawn papers premature best, likely plain irresponsible. Basically, say viral loads vaccinated person can, circumstances, reach unvaccinated person. circumstances matter. duration matters. prevalence matters. 

We cannot say vaccinated person likely transmit virus unvaccinated person. leap.  Oy qantas! I’m vaccinated always wanted visit! Send ticket accommodations. Defending murderers weird. Happier?! can't let happen!!! issue would high number exposed contacts date - currently reaching 10k. That's lot people contact trace.  delta virus actually regained original SARS' lethality kept COVID's transmissibility? initial test work. 2 people around tested positive let know Thursday morning. went Walgreens got home tests. Thursday test negative. Fridays positive led others. Indications evades immunity lesser degree delta, evades immunity minimally. indeed seem outcompeted delta, indicating less transmissible well. There’s nothing indicates it’s concern given variant, probably less good amount. I've seen opposite, Delta outcompeting lambda. like matters, get vaccinated! That’s something like doubling normal mortality! There's ongoing trials delta specific updates. Companies like Microsoft feeling pressure cities reside. built huge campuses retail businesses depend foot traffic longer exists. lot lost revenue especially tax revenue. I'm guessing one big factors businesses considering calling people back. Hence home currently. Even asymptomatic, effectively quarantine infectious period. much time families. husband works home night shift still gets give kids hugs kisses night  may right nomenclature. Folks org look “senior leader.” encompass anyone driving business direction. 

I put instead Senior Director hate saying I’m senior director reason, sounds pompous (just me). enjoy ambiguity. read article stay home moms complaining remote work.

What day alive. think another surge people go indoors winter. don’t know whether smaller larger Delta though. tested home twice believe positives take home. day earlier negative. went Covid testing center walk-in testing gave rapid Antigen PCR (2 day wait). spouse wanted rapid PCR test went got too.  Thank you.   I'm happy quality life increased personally.  definitely cons environment global community switch continuous remote work models. Remote work 100% positives world environment (no even including economic ramifications), there's always walking line wanting stay informed wanting keep sanity.

 say ""I'm gonna ignore bit"" give break, get internal voice saying ""that's want do""  mayo clinic dataset linked above, somebody else linked dataset July Wisconsin even worse numbers Mayo Clinic study MN. 73% effective hospitalization among fully vaccinated people. point company realize there's justification workers area? They'll simply outsource another region another country. It’s ok unless kids young, can’t daycare. sick jackass anyway? large typical globule micron scale?

Larger 0.3 microns, presume? might last weeks

But that's exactly doing... people COVID fatigued we've long without restrictions (excluding border).

Personally think full lockdown would effective high vaccination rates. see across world higher levels vaccination stopping Delta outbreaks. living wages? Interesting. company, senior leader SVP above; aka department head. Also Fortune 50 company. distinction senior leader gets apparent VP level. That's perks, compensation, decision making power starts pile on. Directors VPs even power hire, fire, promote. don’t know there’s scale, would also call mine severe. I’m also dyslexic dysgraphic. 

I love quiet. It’s time concentrate really go booster point. 1 million people unapproved america. plan soon well. Im going roll dice life waiting CDC wake fuck realize produce enough vaccine give everyone wants booster one. Yes, that's exactly. countries Europe spent whole time lockdown, life certainly normal between. conscious pandemic, attending large gathering would give second thought. case Australia though. Indeed. Flevoland back water. government ever “pouring money people’s pocket” want corrupt? higher title, bigger ego. I’m embarrassed takeaway article. freaked months ago person interviewed npr said son's teeth started crack fall recovered covid, many unknowns people still willing risk long term health children's well. covid killed people much faster, may already died like SARS mers .. delta largely true vaccines made need worry. looking like booster puts back efficacy range, reducing breakthroughs 86%. idea evidence they're basing 8 months on, every paper I've seen supports 6 most.

It would longer delta. Delta took whack antibody binding efficiency top spreading easier. It’s weird seeing things like knowing job physically impossible home current mRNA vaccines work, albeit decreased level. That's one reasons they're pushing booster: get antibody levels Lambda surge November rip exposed population.  track responsible killing 1% population Iran end year. That's insane. HOWEVER, mean they're hospital covid.

Watch ppl miss part believe large school systems trained person, true nurse school, nurse district level training creating policies. non covid times, vast majority school nurse's time spent dealing managing kids medicines calling parents pickup kids feeling well. Lack commute contributes much work-life balance mental health. would massively cut traffic emissions Honestly, started forex trading lock down.

My eyes open, made entire month's salary one week.

If make something sustainable ain't never working nobody ever period.

And Sure, winning time hit miss sometimes.   Unfortunately comment removed. 

It’s little silly blame population vaccinated current vaccine protects vaccinated individuals protect spreading virus. 

I think people forget vaccinated carry viral load counts unvaccinated, presumably shorter periods time don’t get Long Covid. 

To recognize fact first foremost creates social attitude vaccinated individuals believe contribute spreading virus act manner consistent witness many vaccinated people. Ie: mask, social distancing, etc. 

Anyways, wish well thank discussion. Optimism, **give already** stats health die Covid? Like BMI, co-morbids, etc. 

That would meaningful data. literally us. work fortune 100 company original plan bring us back part time 4th July full time labor day.

We gone back remote work, ""targeting"" going back part time offer labor day, current numbers see happening time, single shot. 

Many countries used delayed 2nd dose protocols mRNA vaccines. results protocols demonstrated antibody responses/immunity equal better protocol clinical trials (which FDA uses).

When boosters become available, wait specified amount time second dose getting booster (unless specific guidance cover scenarios provided). actually C-level leadership department heads wants staff back. Middle managers different line workers. also prefer WFH too. agree vaccinations way go. I’m trying find good counter arguments question above. Cdc says one. Wrong. Young kids wear masks. statement like that, clearly meant be. job. wait get us back remind us daily job (the majority done phone) simply possible remotely oh DM where. want nice black ones! Universal, would anywhere. hot hell unless swimming beach, going find everyone unmasked, maybe unvaccinated, thing fully indoors.

Since would imagine people would never let kids mask vaccinate, kids spreading school whole situation screwed. large amount tourists traveling state spreading it.

Wife coworker went Florida 12 days ago guess tested positive. No, 80 years. Ever.

FB destroyed relate sustained communities million years. best example Ben Franklin's observation lie goes around world Truth gets boots on. company embracing hybrid model, least yet. Want us back full time office end year.

They've already lost soooooo much talent continue lose go path. Meanwhile, best 2 years company history PANDEMIC worked home.

It's honestly mind-boggling. full lockdown might last weeks

NZ full lockdown past week (And likely extended). may done well previously, vaccination procurement policy good all.

Not entirely true. NZ went Pfizer Pfizer strategy (Although procure vaccines also). rollout slowly ramping time, currently sitting 40% atleast one dose. That's low, complacency would played part. think wrong say vaccination procurement wrong. they'll implode it. 100% this. company embracing this. Want us back full time office end year.

They've already lost soooooo much talent continue go path. Meanwhile, best 2 years ever PANDEMIC worked home.

It's honestly mind-boggling. Ah, unintended upside COVID. forced world try WFH insomuch jobs supported it. 

For many, means living want instead company happens be, usually expensive metro area homeownership reach, especially younger employees early career track. 

I sold L.A. County townhome, made healthy profit seller's market upgraded first-ever single family home lots room, 3-car garage, solar, etc., paying L.A. Plus, I'm much happier without grueling commute every single day, matter bad feel morning. 

With old system, felt sick, might call feel better later day. home, start later slowly ease work. Way less missed days, way productivity, precious time lost commuting. Commuting eat time, adds stress, adds wear tear vehicles, consumes precious energy could normally use work tasks. That's assume even make we're going without tickets, accidents, etc. believe I've accidents way work, fault someone else interactions road-debris. 

Sometimes traffic bad 1 hour commute 5 hours. Yes, one night took girlfriend 5. Hours. To. Get. Home. Needless say called sick next day. And, employees often lack imagination make everyone come around time, traffic misery maximized. issue WFH. 

No wonder real-estate market going crazy everywhere, even lot agents really get what's happening. Sheesh. Horrifying. line already drawn work state. Glad see I'm alone lost smell... starting seem weird. Sorry come back. Mine started coming back smells time starting 3 weeks after, back fully 3 months after. Despite jokes making laugh. would give example joke would laugh I'm lazy rn local city officials brokered companies bring employees back downtown commercial districts exchange favorable tax incentives. Since kids considered efficient spreaders? Sadly financial difference company overcome. think people realise snap lockdowns, life relatively normal here. NSW kinda screwed everybody mucking around. company keeping minimum 3 day week quota office. didn’t realize much hated working cubicle farm I’d away year. spent weekend job searching. many companies offering full WFH. smart companies realize WFH way compete companies might pay little don’t offer ability work remote. unvaccinated adults age 50 nearly dozen times likely hospitalized vaccinated counterparts, 17 times likely die

As Aug. 7, unvaccinated adults 18 49 years old 25 times likely hospitalized COVID-19 vaccinated adults age.  Lol vaccine we're middle century pandemic... start ""it's slippery slope bullshit"" Carbon foot print way lower. Guess what, lot middle managers feel like need people office boss around otherwise really doing? What's example public facing white collar job? Energy power plant cleaner efficient energy car. added output ac lighting somewhat offset decreased output office. personally keep house 80 even home I'm definitely using office saving. much I've decided invest insulated windows smart thermostats light improving homes efficiency overall. considering boon home improvement stores imagine I'm alone there. 

But goes beyond that. Less demand office buildings means less wasteful construction.  Less wasteful use land space. Less traffic means less road maintenance, less road expansion, fewer accidents. Though, we're offsetting increased delivery services. Less driving means less maintenance replacement vehicles. Mine last leg couple years since barely drive lasted longer expected... there's aspects like less spent fancy clothes less spent washing them. load per month point. undies white t-shirts occasional real outfit. still shower daily I'm using product primping look best. 

....just overall we're using less nearly everything. that's great economy can't really see point unnecessarily forcing everyone back miserable situation they'll waste money resources shit actually want need. like forcing everyone break windows glass shops stay business... why?   That's good. boss also prefers working home. Helps superior sympathetic (and hypocritical). That's good result I'm glad got it. left moment know argument he'll refuse consider. plays lot venues, may lose money vaccinated.

I've said that, analogy wise, he's coming perspective getting wasted living room harming anyone except potentially himself, whereas me, like getting wasted getting behind wheel.

Even him, statistically, risk small, know people who've died Covid would rather take risk happening him. Plus fibromyalgia, symptoms similar Long Covid would wish anyone.

I wish friends would understand we're interfering, genuinely care them. I've ecstatic back office times week since reopened June. nobody watching you, nice feeling come whenever want leave whenever. Granted, home going office forces finish work soon never let seep home life. lot people struggled separating boundaries home work life continue work longer hours. Entire UI teams Google pulling Homer bushes. point I'm waiting us actually forced office seeing many people lose tune changes... Maybe certain jobs different silo’ed idea “I can’t job unless lunch teammates” odd me. 

I’ve always felt less productive offices. “Collaboration” always code chit chat, micromanagement, time wasting extra meetings people interrupting BS emergencies.  Ughh sucks. anything avoid shot dark matter what? tips resources could recommend? one positive rapid spread delta immunity (and late higher vax rates) it’s leaving wake. think far infections caught. think we’ll see virus begin become endemic, see slower spread lower death/hospitalization rates, winter surge comes focus primarily schools precautions aren’t taken there. don’t think it’ll near last winter terms serious outcomes particular.  Exactly time commute hour way 8 hour job make dinner clean like 2 hours bed that's time handle entire running household - grocery shopping, laundry, scheduling, doctors appointments, Bill's, paperwork, cleaning - feel like work day every day keep falling behind . enjoy sub par services companies use lol. Sorry. Left out. Should’ve known though bc dad trains maintenance crews power plants. Honestly kill two birds one stone. Less cars road good thing commuting means better balance. CMBS (commercial mortgage backed securities) entered chat. see can't make Pfizer vaccine mandatory allow exceptions vaccinated vaccines. company keeps mentioning idea moving back site, resounding answer ""You lose majority staff *immediately*."" far. can't even fill on-site supervisor roles have. true... Every form communication company get back office this. ""Culture"" everyone wearing mask stand 6M apart office, haha. Agree 100%. ""give up, countries let run rampant mutate"" makes sense whatsoever.

Even government modelling decides so-called ""zero covid"" unfeasible, current actions, including level 4 lockdown would same. literally solution present time given quickly hospital system would collapse. ""Outcome based work"", I'm stealing that, perfectly said, cheers! hard truth virus infectious us get point lives. critical thing ensure get vaccination get it. run virus lie forever. 2 years now, 5 years now, 25 years covid.

Vaccinations protect severe symptoms thats thing matters That's good think depends, lot employees abuse work home making excuses everything done time. account clerk like that. I'm happy letting WFH continue, abused, BS. win around, always people abusing this. I’ve able go get lunch easily WFH.  I’ll definitely look that! Thank much! Yes, discussed elsewhere thread.

Since get reading every comment, I'll summarize.

In Canada, got second doses months ago. seems plausible protection wanes time seeing higher efficacies protection waned much many Americans able get second doses much sooner.

All suggests booster shot needed certain amount time. Delta changed things. Man beautiful, living dream sir. Great summary, thanks. 

These two things seem contradictory time diagnosis, vaccinated unvaccinated VIRAL mutation rate virus inversely proportional vaccination rate. vaccinate, less likely new variants.

I'm thinking overwhelming number mutations take place early infection vast numbers viruses replicating host. vaccinated unvaccinated people viral loading, would think would generating mutations rate.

Am missing something here, one wrong? feel drained frustrated hour stressful commuting even get office work I'm best That’s need use nostalgia say “bring back neighbourhood corner store!” It’s super effective. repost Bloomberg's fear porn piece. isn't. 

There's perception people work less home, studies shown decades people barely work office, too. Like 2 3 hours day. That's all... illusion see people desk assume they're productive. 

Further, people worry perception working home, know they're monitored closely, try compensate. also time front machine less distractions... Ask programmers they're productive working home rare exception get ""absolutely."" (likewise, ask think programmers productive home probably get ""no,"" egocentric bias.)

While seen studies come yet, surprised turns people vastly productive working home. 

If ""evidence,"" almost certainly stems managers finally actively paying attention real activity thinking seems low, realizing *always was*... start looking new job doesnt sound like end well. Gee, maybe it'd prudent CDC to, know, actually TRACK stuff

but nope! would go narrative regularly report kind thing morning standup: tried a/b/c didn’t work x/y/z today I’m going think go better because…

If you’re getting accused slacking aren’t solving everything instantly definitely think looking role without dimwit breathing neck, that’s tough situation Great!

Now someone needs figure warehouse workers, truck drivers, factory workers, retail workers, restaurant workers, carpenters, plumbers, on, work remote too. Lol, vast majority office ppl one department office surfing web chatting 85% work day… no, hitting nerve, vastly overestimating productive typical office worker even office. Gebauer's Ethyl chloride numbing spray (instant numbing, rather waiting 45 mins Emla cream work) might better option you. insurance cover it. $40 worth freak faint lol. company won’t hire juniors mid levels aren’t manage others, themselves. Sounds awful son wore one last year two complaints. fit important. used Happy Masks (1) protrude away mouth don’t get wet (which makes hard breathe through) (2) filters underwire good quality. Whole lot misinformed conjecture buddy... supply issue.

There little hesitancy here, stock coming in. full supplies rollout ahead schedule (and current records daily vaccinations highest they've been, vaccinated 1% population yesterday alone). also allows spreading people everyone congregating like 50 cities throughout country

This could allow home ownership smaller towns Getting people able work home terrific - much better environment helps mitigate horrible housing situation.

That’s give take 152M cases. half country, pretty eye opening hope everyone thank Ron Desantis work!! good papers came last year trying estimate IFR put around 0.5-1.5% IIRC. test subset population, like passengers single cruise ship, get ballpark. much changed last year terms treatment variants want rely number anymore. personally better office setup, never find meeting room, need worry traffic, I'm always time. flexibly extend day work longer needed since worry commute home.

Additionally longer need take contractors visiting house. take minutes answer door, get right back working. work days I'm sick enough contagious, sick enough useless.

On flip side, absolutely less off-the-cuff collaboration. stifles creativity perhaps innovation point it’s worth mandating. Another angle remote worker put much time since finality end.

I think ""we treat like flu"" ""its flu""  

The latter deniers, ignorant people. tried explain reply above, continuing treat like idiot doesnt understand smallest deatil covid actually is.

People use Flu relatable - get vaccinated - covid id far similar peoples lived experience polio, non memory anyone 70.

Now, obviosuly believe wont able learn live it, thast fine opinion. experience healthcare informs vaccinated population, develop better treatments fear subside, adn eventually things return pretty much normal - thats opinion.

That wont case people know real wont continue vaccinate.

You already see differs within population compared influenza vaccines - vax rate way double flu vaccination rates, vaccines last lot longer, single virus.

BTW, cannot make sense vaccine hesitancy parts US - idea whats going happen think elimination works, people lie, snuck in, pretend pandemic. It’s expensive hell. ppl pay pocket get vaccinated quickly. whole concept living Alberta scares me. relatives absolutely idea there. think cost living cheaper. Sorry, I'd rather less life. need weeks immunity actually build up.

There's benefits stated, mention saving shit ton money rent office space, brainer companies able work remotely.  People miss office go back office without forcing people want go office - office. experience Israel help inform plans US boosters. It’s Pfizer there. Moderna studying half doses boosters, don’t know complete yet it’s likely one results CDC waiting detailed recommendations. Sept. 20 start date 4 weeks away.

Triage, words. think majority office buildings owned business occupies them, usually rent them. commercial real estate companies also going trouble. Oh “Kids aren’t dying worldwide COVID,”

I think it’s phrases like people take issue with.

My country “reported” 330 deaths Covid. might seem small big UK… still 1 deaths 5 month old child. that’s still least 1 child 330 Covid killed. may report cutoff children’s deaths from, doesn’t mean happen. There’s “less” them.  Delta contagious polio 1918 flu. Spoken like someone bottom ladder idea they’re talking about. I’m manager. could remote forever. It’s actually lot younger people fresh college vocally disappointed pushing return office date back. young people usually don’t kids home obligations, work partially social (at least industry). 

I’ve got plenty without micromanaging anyone caring appearances butts seats. care results mental health. It’s actually lot work directly check people struggling try organize fun virtual events (I’d rather even bother).  hell ""level 1 3"". one handed level graduated computer science degree. Practically CS graduates university hired decent tech companies span months. sound absolutely clueless. Thankfully I’m unemployed lol need worry there. I’ve ordered PCR test arrive next day two fingers crossed! Florida less bare minimum. Well hard us get this! normal buddy, take blinders off. CDC stupidly lifted mandate appeal anti Vaxers come around they’re going keep eating crow.. hope doesn’t get worse.

I'd working evenings bit get stuff done we're trying get another rev door. Friday comes kids mom sister going go dropping kids sister's place.

Oh there's tons outsourcing question much hurts employment. can't resume without tripping recruiters everywhere walk America. Point stands, job go remote soon. walked emergency department right would like, ‘What happening.’ Every single hallway beds patients, every chair,” said Ms. Murdock, describing system’s hospital Gulfport, staff converted surgical recovery room overflow week, husband wife 40s, neither vaccinated, died within days other, recalled. unvaccinated 48-year-old nurse died Monday. “We five people die, like room room room room,” last Friday, said.

The vaccines safe, can’t prevent continuing happen. agree many people don’t well WFH, don’t good WFH setups. Others do. It’s definitely one-size-fits-all.

Most people crappy setups intending WFH caught surprise. People choose WFH better setups someone forced IMHO, issues solved remote work actually issues horrible open offices long commutes- anything specifically remote vs onsite work.

Two decades ago, office door closed locked. I’ve door since. Next large cubicles high walls, smaller cubicles short walls, long desks small dividers, open plan.

Yes, companies could bring back decent working spaces.. won’t.

As commutes, can’t locate offices everywhere, housing always cheaper farther away anywhere company might reasonably place office.

So yeah office could fixed… it’s going HR issues much much problematic remote employees.

Speaking HR, people company reported significantly less harassment WFH (sexual, racial, otherwise). “accidental” butt touches, complaining ethnic food lunch, fewer comments clothes hair.

The harassment occur also much easier document.

It doesn’t go away, course harassers adapt, it’s mentioned unexpected perk realize working around employee pick kids school every day work hours-

Not WFH thing. parents come office late constantly due kids, cut office early pick kids, leaving everyone else pick start building lives/schedules around able disappear couple hours day.

If keep productivity aren’t missing meetings communication, cares hours work?

I used take 2-3 hour lunches one office job (along boss, boss). We’d stay late night, changes could made 6 simply good current tech substitutes classic conference room whiteboard session. remotely sucks.

Camera pointed physical whiteboard works well enough. Jamboard iPad otherwise.

Sitting physical whiteboard session sucks too. Meanwhile FDA delaying approval 5-11 months months get data ultra-rare heart inflammation issue *caused covid orders magnitude often*. like they're trying appease antivaxxers, that's never going work.

Maybe ok looking like pandemic way out, changed tune minute cases started spiking again, especially started hitting kids harder. delay unacceptable. Oh noes. people wanting go office spend 10 hours day dealing dumb bullshit like pointless meetings, traffic, annoying coworkers. would terrible deal that. “The longer […] Covid-19 keeps people home, harder may get back” 

Ok hear - productivity unaffected, let people stay home!? could COVID symptoms, they're also allergy cold symptoms. tests come back negative probably clear. can, maybe take sick day two worst symptoms clear. Per 100k:

1.63 fully vaccinated

11.75 unvaccinated, partially vaccinated, unknown. Oh yeah guess part explained. Usually us we've tested we've cough sore throat kids cough. Thankfully access saliva pcr super easy come back 6 12 hours. Industrial park economies built around commuter lunches. Commercial area developers way recover that, massive waste begin with. Good riddence, economy closer residential anyway big disruption adjust to. employer went back masks, released something saying people continue work home till October 1st, vaccinated return.

/s Remember getting vulnerable vaccinated managing cases hospital load. shut everything moment there's 1 case. Yes implication many made equal viral load PCR nasal tests, implied equal transmission vaccinated/unvaccinated. seem make sense given every phase (hospitalization/death) showed 10x 25x reduction vaccinated - zero impact point infection? Good see data analyzing actual viral properties, vs extrapolating PCR data. Bahahahah Comintern vaccine 2016 fucking consequential. Chickens home roost  logic, western militaries invade occupy foreign nations forcefully inoculate prevent “carrying mutating plague” refuse forcefully inoculate citizens?

Even presuming 100% western world vaccinated next seven days, COVID still exist third world mutate (remember current delta variant arose India variants arisen countries like Brazil) possibility mutation defeating vaccine arising population spreading here.

The way achieve end goal (which seems zero COVID) would impossible without unanimous immediate mandatory distribution COVID vaccine entire world, farcical nature would require near-total isolation rest world achieve even local level. imagine stupid think they’re saying leave us alone they’re public spreading deadly virus.

I can’t imagine stupid think vaccinated means COVID automatically. absolutely qualms requiring quarantining people known COVID cases requiring regular testing non vaccinated mandating people forced put chemicals bodies authoritarian wrong.

I'm suggesting Pfizer vaccine dangerous; simply appear fair comparison. Hate needles honestly even feel it. super surprised fast painless was. Planning getting 3rd fairly soon. ""I'm retired nurse...""

I've hearing one LOT lately. Either tons nurses know shit, they're simply talking something understand, they're straight lying. article dated Aug 9th. Since , UK seen another wave rising covid cases numbers. Scotland , 7 day average 3 times much low Aug 9th , Wales , actually suppressed previous peak. 

The death rate though see much change , proof vaccine works. Good comparison. don’t know you’re getting downvoted. Yes need keep eye them, still vast minority infections. 5 months since second shot. allowing people age health group get 3rd shot 8 months. 

So, jumped line 3 months. primarily Israel letting almost adults get 3rd shot. 16 older? 12 older? getting vaccinated nice either. tried that.

a) statements bearing one another; and

b) Fentanyl somehow dangerous failed therapeutic approved. 

I feel like I'm taking non-FDA-approved crazy pills sometimes. 

Company makes drugs. Company tests drugs. Company submits drugs tests FDA. FDA reviews drug test data. Data say drug works, cause Monkey Butt Syndrome (or does, requires warning re: side effects). FDA approves drug.

AKA Economic Darwinism  don’t think could stand took kids festival ended hospital COVID wanted take somewhere fun.  conscience wouldn’t let live.  wouldn’t able blame anyone putting situation.  hand, live! Like need enjoy lives able go places fun.  I’m torn, mess 😞 I'm four months lifetime state pension health insurance. mean correct answer... Yes, agree. It’s stressful thinking possibly would denied care. I’m medical field I’m curious tell choosing get want can’t get it.  Worry = shutting schools down; like last year.

Less worry = in-person schooling (but masks).

&amp;#x200B;

You're right kids least risk; fact played roles choices vax last.

Individually, kids also seem spread less disease shorter period time; but, jam bunch unvaxxed kids together eight hours day, they're gonna bring home people kids.

IMO, school-related choices based keeping population whole safe; year, half adult population vaxxed, so, concerns spread schools lessened... given we've overwhelmed hospitals (thanks removal restrictions people's loss concern), would irresponsible let large swath population intermingle totally unprotected. one thing everyone actually consider. Id go back heartbeat. work business/commerical park many restaurants, bars supermarket get eat well buy wine right work dinner. Working home like house arrest. mob boss political opposition shithole country. mean save gas pay back electricity bill plus dishes.  mean, remote working awesome sure. fair half fucks company two hours work less day really messing shit up. I'd love remote working continue something done this.  place already running issues. ""Is work home?... I'd like remove name.""

Also two people verge retirement retire.

Only reason mind much apartment tiny office 2.5 miles away full kitchen. easy identify folks without young kids  BMI bullshit metric- fact changed late 90s suddenly millions became classified overweight literally overnight. watching, Victoria might able control current outbreak, Kiwi professor Tony Blakely University Melbourne suggested go lockdown light morning TV wont able control it, lets see, hoping best.  Yes jobs, obviously, specialized. sure case average person working home. he/she really irreplaceable location?

&amp;#x200B;

Besides, even stay US might get salaries levelled cheaper areas.  Watch vaccinated start calling friends family finally get damn shot say well approved get it. got family friends like that, call ass start making excuses tell stop fucking around mature adult get shot. Antibody concentrations several markers shit dimish slowly day 119. (Figure 3) table starts day 29, one day second dose Moderna vaccine.

Antibodies beta variant fade fastest.

At least that's got this... Figure 3 useful us.  would go get Moderna you.  less risk still risk want minimize son. wanted participate vaccine trials btw schedule fit.

My point comparing risk vaccines risk catching covid. comparing risk vaccine risk catching covid getting complication. Fortunately currently data suggest risk vaccine higher former. Oh okay, makes sense. worry family age can’t get medical reasons. It’s scary thinking could get Covid possibly get care. Would medical professionals able distinguish can’t get medical reasons? say people’s medical charts? probably helps little variants think it’s like flu virus get multiple times. Agreed !,,, going back! Take leave You’d love staying home forever lazy fucks reason you’re staying? Instructions unclear. Took horse de-wormer   Covid isn’t like polio chicken pox might get twice (I never developed chicken pox immunity multiple times), it’s much like flu. flu new variants every year, sometimes even within season. result, it’s seeming people covid multiple times like flu. sigh again, vaccinating important. hate hate humanity ends. squeeze every little bit profit. 100% dystopian society. haven’t read Fox today, last week thought Fox changing tunes promoting vaccines? Who's pro-covid? That's like saying pro-choice people pro-abortion. heard mutated drop bears due habitat loss :( r/usernamechecksout  And, hopefully, enjoy right harmed infected anti-maskers/anti-vaxxers.  


""Your right swing fist around ends tip nose,"" that.  logic antivax mutually exclusive Would gone easier wore mask complied health directives

It's edited get see full picture even phonetics idea say it. ... looked away shot went first even realize already over.  also literally millions people involved stuff, like 12 segregate something.  pay attention - vax decreases chances getting terminally ill catch virus; prevent getting infected.  Preprint UK study found significant difference vaccine effectiveness dosing interval use &lt; 9 weeks doses comparison. Mandate living shit it. Now.

Everywhere.

I don’t care anymore. fact, WANT watch anti vaxxers go APE SHIT mandates. brings joy. 

Require vaccine ever facet life. Thanks. changed name, used ""covid-19 vaccine Moderna"" Literally would solved problem insurance company pricing. Yeah man, I’m bitter. I’m bitter people like lost family virus people like OP’s friends decided go unvaccinated selfish reasons.

But y’all wanna give high fives *just now* getting simple shot. Sounds like mix communism (or commerce) Illuminati. I'm sure help uptake. also used lot companies 1980s. Like twice many. mention fewer people plus shorter lifespan. Statistically able maintain 70 like today. expecting Pirates Caribbean “but **heard** me” 

Does Johnny Depp's character say this? Someone told Depp/Heard thing recently brain used whole month's supply Brain Blast notice   girlfriend's ex Q-nut refuses allow 14 year old get vaccinated. approval pave way it? ""ehrmahgerd! protect yer comirnaty!""

then explained got room sec googled it, hehe company made team permanent remote work last year. production gone people putting hours. mention money company saving office space. least one good thing came hell.  sorry hear this. 

If job done remotely, would encourage look company allows, embraces full time remote work. many, tech, anything main job hands keyboard phone ear. 

I work tech part company, tech moved 100% remote (approx 500 workers) business units remote feasible (5,000 + people, many customer facing rotate goes in).

There companies organizations leaders care, able, time find ones fit you.

Wishing best! actually developed two Turks I'm going bother linking articles already familiar Julian Assange, Chelsea Manning, Edward Snowden. many others get nearly much press coverage. Someone else replied thread means companies require proof vaccination.

I'm glad got vaccinated early, time I'm like ""darn $500 would nice"" lol

But company really good incentives, hope plus fda approval helps pull stragglers (as there's mandates announced yet) think nurses doctors risking health every minute shift try keep others alive better allocation

I'm going disagree that, think also fair point plenty health care professional also anti-maskers anto-vaxers.

Let make different point. N95s promoted goal providing everyone protection vaccine available. ever goal never promoted, despite N95s readily available public September last recall though, early thinking virus' spread primarily large droplets lead CDC think distancing probably enough scenarios

That best guess based solid data. made recommendation without sufficient data based felt public would tolerate. much reasoning Fauci suggested follows. fair public. cautious recommendation preference limited data others, seemed, standing outside 'range' prevented infection

And yet we've known better regarding viruses century. chose prefer convenience time rather reasoned recommendation based data. sarcastic here? You’re LITERALLY thread approval. next level approval want? fucking Pinky swear? countries around world, third world countries first world countries deciding put place restrictions lockdowns even table USA?

Because costs money Republicans hate spending money help people.   really invest apple. get it, that's concern while. yet history vaccines, happened. side effects show right away, within two months. six months many millions Americans, hundreds millions people worldwide.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Serious question: journalist trying convey describe HIPAA piece legislation Clinton-era? emphasis: “…long-lasting COVID symptoms common kids severe illness.”

I see lot people miss nuance. People often associate “long-covid” covid infection… regardless severity husband went Walmart today ones wearing masks. might better luck Wow. office helps self-control work want to? That's interesting perspective.

I guess that's like people drink bar avoid becoming alcoholic lol many viruses historically eliminated way? People basically thought invincible got vaccine. tapering bit Delta, one know vaccinated gotten test unless travel symptoms.

You individual coronavirus subreddit edge case likely get tested vaccinated. matter whether ready get back normal - matters whether virus ready let you. meaningful proportion breakthrough cases evidence vaccinated people spread COVID effectively unvaccinated people, there's lot less reason optimism two months ago. said last week, schools normal planned. details come.

There's speculation vaccine passport going announced Monday well non essential services Good! traffic please! exactly wtf. like seeing tsunami coming, putting life preservers telling kids done testing yet. Hey, arguing science behind it. one way other. administrative position, zero attachments anyone involved brainer. added risk human health potential outbreak sickness (especially global pandemic) regardless number people die (sick crippled forever) unacceptable risk. put using whatever staff already potentially exposed.

That even getting fact specifically talking indigenous aka tribal population. assumed would see crossover animal lovers native enthusiasts. again, shocked, people think added risk great. makes nervous - work (more less top career) predicated people offices :(

I mean - work home definitely hypocritical - program conference rooms, auditoriums, building management systems, etc. That's Nightmare Scenario need consider. variant deadly as, deadlier SARS contagious as, contagious Delta Variant. apocalyptic scenario.  Ok, I’ll bite. dark incentives move slowly?? I’m wondering haven’t finished clinical trials. end game requires whole country actually solve problem, getting cases low enough virus stops spreading among community vaccinations non-pharmaceutical interventions like masking better ventilation. Washington tantalizingly close like two weeks, everyone took sign throw caution wind rather sign measures we'd taking working.

Because nobody agree - everyone's sort shrugged given - everyone going end hard way, infections sweeping population. we'll _still_ need measures like masking blunt impact hospital system.  devil's advocate. think higher ups would want gather measurable metrics tons remote monitoring software market today. Even zoom, there's feature meeting host use anonymously see attendees actively meeting screen. Somewhere chickenpox flu surprising, given employers *super* picky nowadays. Even unskilled positions require personality tests, aptitude tests, multiple rounds interviews, making harder time-intensive job seekers find work. good difference vaccination rate Canada Florida 10%  missed last part point #8. 
In vaccinated individual, initial viral load similar someone unvaccinated. 
However, vaccinated individual see load drop faster. 
So, spend less time peak viral load thus infect less people, statistically speaking. 

Hope clears up. rush go back businesses, tax thing? already hear people yelling

bUt MuH fReEdOmS!! FDA/CDC approve vaccines themselves. manufacturer submit clinical safety data, intended use, federal agency review give approval. approval either EUA full approval. They’re already saying it’s conflict interest reason?  Good, I've WAY productive working home. need keep way Totally agree. 

He wrong statement, though. ((THIS RESPONSE MOSTLY POST THAT'S BURIED BELOW, SPEAKS SPREAD)) 

R0 R-effective two different metrics.

R0 unchanged actions immunity.

R-effective changed actions immunity.

&amp;#x200B;

We certain R-effective values every strain we've faced have, overall, much lower related R0 values.

Starting 1,000 infections, previous variants R-effective value 2.5 (assuming two-weeks cycles), everybody US would've gotten infected within 30 weeks.

Instead, point, we've recorded 38 million infections (about 12% population)... undercount sure; much? 

We've recorded 625,000 deaths timeframe; little 20% deaths would've expected everyone gotten sick vaccines.

Going even higher estimate, 25% US population became infected course last 78 weeks, R-effective (on average) 1.35.

&amp;#x200B;

So, either R0 values way off, estimates deadliness way off, mitigation vaccination strategies worked slow spread; believe latter.

Considering business closures mask mandates stopped months ago, given higher R0 Delta, vaccines highly effective keeping R-effective well R0. Ah yeah, kids tradeoff. fair point well made. Medical confidentiality rules pre-Covid. prefer cat assholes office. take fucking weird. planet business going say, 'if vaccinated back March"", going count.

No one. even discussed? ridiculous. Abandon posts! Flee! Flee lives! knew opinion would unpopular, I'm really learning fundamentally different view work people here. work also passion. spend time anything else, better be. friends hobbies, leisure moderation. get bored even anxious.

I realize lots people view work way. Perhaps grateful work lifelong passion. could talk academic research, research friends colleagues, 12 hours day, could. professional community dispersed right now. pandemic, fellow academics would talk work work, dinners work, bars that, great. Nowadays call people talk research ideas feel like I'm imposing.

The office meeting place-- fish tank like minded people could swim around bump other. would agreement would time. discombobulated, I'm left wondering many people never wanted first place, many miss community. Sounds like Ballmer Peak fine art. Unfortunately, cat's bag now.

They've already announced boosters all, lot vaccinated people decided accept infection--however mild--at all.

It's bad, places need vaccine much, much more. watched Senna documentary first time tonight 😭 imagine eventually death count grow high literally cannot ignored. state home 22 million people. happens grows 3000 daily deaths 21,000 people dying every week? that's Covid deaths, including unreported ones. Thousands could dying every day. long means deaths millions within months? look like much national level 330M people, months saw death millions Floridans, state would collapse.

This masking vaccinating important. vaccine stop getting sick, keep dying. mask stop getting sick either, keep getting others sick catch virus.

Even virus deadly claim, thousands people getting sick ending hospital still overload medical services, resulting deaths otherwise would've prevented (car crashes, accidents, heart attacks, shootings, etc.). may die, person got shot otherwise would've survived surgery, instead died wounds wait spot.

Every day roll dice. Eventually we're gonna get snake eyes, world gonna suffer it. big one usually political hurdles around access data. working ML models, gaining access secure manufacturing data imperative experiments. often helpful analyst analyst communication breaks end don’t feel empowered share. 

That’s gets escalated, coach analysts ways influence side real roadblock executive level, hop bulldoze make analysts lives easier.

Unclog traffic, analogy. job make easier, encumber obstacles. 48 hours image recorded every 10 minutes, footage shows coronavirus red spots circulating among mass gray blobs — bat’s brain cells. infected, bat’s cells begin fuse neighboring cells. point, entire mass bursts, resulting death cells. blood machine return normal, world returned normal 1918 Influenza Pandemic; nothing, good bad, lasts forever.  Well shots available, obvious answer get vaccinated back line become even fully vaccinated. always show people getting vaccinated nose mask main picture? first point happen source, always get asked “why get covid vaccine doesn’t stop spread anyways??! I’m young I’ll survive fine!” advice travel figure plan test positive end trip. place time quarantine 10 days destination? Also look health care system.

Another island French West Indies asking tourists leave past capacity. would also recommend Medjet would pay transported one bigger islands US. Makes wonder actual impact this? businesses made covid pandemic, hurt give workers want? Hope remaining symptoms clear back 100% soon. point, inescapable conclusion lockdown. far easier durable solution without locking everybody home. make vaccines mandatory. ""businesses require them"", flat mandatory. Yes, that's government overreach, lockdown even worse one. self preservation. read article pointed one consequences remote work makes far obvious produces things doesn't. makes difficult schmoozers function, represents significant portion management types. Jeez, puts things perspective. wonder UK deal something similar.

I'm guessing get healthcare all, may two tiers care - quick money, longer wait time free version. Let know update goes cardiologist, hope get back gym soon possible!   aware vaccines control group destroyed three months trials unblinding giving vaccine? vaccinated almost like black people Africa trust Europeans motives. Strange indeed. dumb meme ""my fall plans"" vs ""the delta variant""

My fall plans changed aside wearing mask places. Vaccines wonderful things.

Fall also month away probably better place least murica rescue long enough believe Covid we-don't-want-to-bother excuse. Ugh! I’m sorry. I’m glad you’re mend though. think caught it? area low vaccination rates?  means downplay vaccination.... friends vaccinated we've several super spreader events past month. first outdoor sports event yesterday (AVP Beach Vball) feel comfortable shoulder shoulder people, even outdoors. :/ Amurican: that’s get liberal communist socialists 😎

Me: alright lift embargo let crumble communism whatever
Amurican: uh- Give example roadblock removed please. Thank you. Parents kids 12 can’t get vaccinated give shit. Ya, tell 5 2 year olds time got vaccinated, matter cought covid work not. whole point people believed getting vaccinated would actually create immunity covid. Remember whole thing stopping spread? last forever.

(The remote work, COVID.) Thanks  Hell yes! Home ever feel pandemic going (Afghanistan) good idea election walkable? Focus getting employees hard wired ethernet internet connection, nice new 4k camera, dedicated mic, lighting, good office chair much better. Never go back office. No. certainly not. I’m saying absolutely one leave businesses like money. think they’re gonna make money Texas say New York, aren’t gonna leave shot. Imagine easy get voter id Im sick hearing word collaboration!

Work makes us come office everyday “collaborate”… everyone sit desks Zoom meetings. Smh. say thing fair open offices proven time nothing sort deadly virus kill pretty quickly. See SARS. Honeymoon period people feel uncomfortable.  Give 6 months report back. People want listen truth science inconveniences life. choose assume vaccines work, life return normal.

They want hear evidence shows viral load high unvaccinated person even ""feel fine."" want admit they're probably spreading virus around much unvaccinated people. 

But they'll still continue mock unvaccinated trusting science, blame current situation.  wish could shut Facebook down. I've seen. Same. I’m research scientist cannot work home, would love see new normal. Shorter commute me, fighting parking. would even sacrifice cafeteria keep going. Eh like states problems. Texas's issues heat cold wrecking electrical grids think business taking long hard look leaving short sighted. partially hydrogenated! Raised south agree. It’s like I’ve hostage entire life. think get dictate everyone else believes gets do. impose beliefs everyone, reason people take rather standing them. org looking one day week back office starting February 2022. Delta variant tho, knows...

Right anyone go office sign up, limit 30 people. folks back quite bit already. make enticing free food stuff.

But convo coworker couple weeks ago, outdoor company function, everyone vaxxed low risk. person tho said make people come one day week would quit.

I'm probably somewhere middle. can't imagine going back work every day. necessary industry, realize I'm fortunate respect. also miss working people space, would totally okay two-ish days week.

I'm glad NPR interview complete anti-mask/vaxx loonies. think way many networks media outlets giving much air time people fueling fire ratings. irresponsible. 


If person supports masks, vaccinations mitigation measures please take minutes call email local school board members. sane voices need drown vocal minority. teacher I'm even scared go back year last year. taught person virtual simultaneously last year would heartbeat meant students options less kids building overall could space more.  What? mean makes wearing mask totally useless pointless sure let’s hear big brained take Goal post moved. Longterm effects means die basically. would probably tie vaccine comparing unvacinated vaccinated people. exaple vaccinated people x% greater odds developing problem unvacinated thats side effect. 

Currently effects known issues yet arent expecting anything specific general health issues. matter think, matters whether employers mandate not. FDA approval makes far likely will.

When comes standing ""beliefs"" vs. losing primary source income... people reluctantly comply. 1000% joking zombies. didn’t get initially cuz 1 didn’t research 2 fookn terrified needles. time get fear. Plague Island Deluxe.  Yeah, agree. wasn’t best moment. felt like health parents. older helping lot. regular testing every weeks? UTA they’re requiring everyone provide proof negative test 9/8, once. Idk point is. got tested Saturday (negative!) could still contract date? Ty immunity. go Pfizer then? moderna?  Well certainly etymology. sure cool is. Interesting, thanks! Moderna FDA approved next?  like 66% Americans support mask mandate, like 20% wearing them, least area Michigan. probably like 90% people wearing mask mandate effect. maybe people need told do.

Hell no, shut shit right down. 

People need speak stand bent What's death count? Canada vs Australia?  guess since Pfizer received FDA approval, insurers start charge unvaccinated people extra premiums much like smokers. Unless course condition makes vaccination impossible. though, yeah, we're paying unvaccinated. don’t see incivility. It’s apprehensive cycle fear/condescending verbiage/intellectual immunity/false hope/reset back one. Moderns FDA approved? it... make seem safe enough arouse suspicion?! chose get grocery store could go food shopping time work.

Most people say would quit vaccines mandated... I'm like, go ahead!  vaccine card fuck then. Lol. (living 3rd world country) quiet literally stupidest comment currently Reddit. Y’all sick oppression fetish doesn’t exist frankly it’s insanely pathetic sophomoric. 

Nobody, let repeat that, NOBODY ever going hold anyone vaccine. matter much they’d like long playing victims. do, doing, continue do, make exceptionally difficult them, justifiable since people can’t act responsibly via actions. believe official term ""volun-told"". Ive calling JJ ""The Jimmy Jammer"" think officially wont get vaccinated insist vaccine may terrible side effects, invite look package insert virtually medication currently take, look reported side effects drug. Every single drug planet rare reported terrible side effects. Yet, take NSAIDS, insulin, tylenol, novel chemotherapy. Vaccines different. rare reported terrible side effects? Yes. outweigh harm disease, important public health, yes! really trust government. look situation (which difficult know, given foreign journalists China, million foreigners China, tens millions overseas Chinese people talk friends family back home, constant stream videos social media posts hundreds millions people country).

For year, almost restrictions. Restaurants, cinemas, sports events, concerts, bars, schools everything else open. virus spreading country densely populated China, public places open business, outbreak would grow massive proportions short order. Yet nobody knows anyone who's gotten sick since first wave. hospitals filling up.

The fact China short periods intense epidemic control measures, followed long periods calm nearly zero restrictions, points country baseline zero cases, responding individual, new outbreaks happen.  That’s minor issue compared I’m dealing day day basis. honestly feel like I’m ocean Covid one seems care around me. 
Masks even used places go into. he’s smart enough understand without employees, company goes shitter lol Can’t always working company half employees quarantined thanks unvaccinated adults. Working remotely doesn’t work everyone.

Every CEO mandating vaccines workforce.

I sore arm 3 days body aches almost like flu symptoms. worst headache first night. Lasted night could barely sleep luckily ended morning could chill bed rest day.

My girlfriend sore arm. body aches.  Yes, official numbers. agree numbers far likely officially reported numbers, true count likely higher (depending study, confirmed active infections seroconvert \[or antibodies remaining detectable serology testing\] range 2%-8.5% high 22%; However, believe Chinese gov't stand numbers reported since best numbers (and best numbers mean accurate) had, methodology similar countries counting time. 

A accurate count would world-wide serology study boy would love see results! 

And see report China CDC deaths average mostly points excess deaths time limited Wuhan (so undercounted region countries probably undercounted), rest country impacted excess deaths normal. points effectiveness containment measures. least children fare obviously better. I’m done trying change dumbfucks’ minds covid. is. Suppose I’ll hold til then. Thanks  Yeah, starting Sept. 20th can. HHS recommended taking booster 8 months. Please jump gun this. looking longer term boost 3rd dose, waiting bit longer shown give better immune response. Wanting people suffer die political beliefs. Cool, cool. mean I'll need go back get Pfizer I've JnJ? Yes - physical barriers useful airflow vs physical barriers regard pre-existing airflow... US, covid never top 10 weekly causes death since March 2020. low 8th 9th, still flu. third, behind heart disease cancer. peak, think near double deaths heart disease (which normally number one). got bad dose remember? going get completely new(ly named) vaccine. know hard get things straight sometimes zombies fiction dying disabled covid actual possibility. I'll take downvotes now. Per Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) used collect reports adverse events vaccination general public. primarily used identify potential topics investigate regards vaccine reactions. However, event data VAERS often verified often self-reported, assumed adverse events VAERS actually associated cause vaccines, possible estimate frequency adverse events data.

I love acting sometimes really hate industry 😂😬 serve speed appearance vaccine resistant variants.

*COMPLETE NONSENSE* mods remove post spreading misinformation Remember thought would actually stop transmission?

The vaccines substantially reduce transmission, three ways:

1. reduce chance getting infected. Vaccinated breakthroughs spread virus, breakthrough first.

2. Even vaccinated person viral load, vaccines lower rate cell culture positivity (infectivity).

3. Vaccinated people breakthrough cases clear virus faster, infectious less time. get KN-95 N-95 Costco Online.  work credit card company? trying figure work company many similar points 😂. 20 years ago working commuting Boston (hell). got apartment 5 minute walk work.

Morality effective political leadership often get way number one priority make ton money. 78 weeks, we've officially recorded infections 12% population (38.7 million 330 million). 

At time, we've officially recorded 20% deaths would've expected pre-vaccine era.

I think achieved death percentage provides accurate picture overall infection rates.

When consider vaccination rates, can't add 50% 20%; reasonable assume percentage vaxxed previously infected. 

In end, I'd guess 40% population could still get infected, though maybe 35% places things really bad past months.

Given school re-opening midst spikes, guess we'll see rises infections, hospitalizations, deaths, across country, starting next couple weeks. Yeah know one person terrible sample size, makeup lasting like 4x long don’t need wear work. repress cases mask they’ll come later mask mandate ends though. vaccines aren’t good enough end restrictions now, can’t reasonably insist mask X amount time change equation. never said group narrow. said healthy. top benefits people commented already, days go (my job deals secure documents can't leave office) easy find parking 25% cheaper used be.

The phase 1 studies afaik done 6 months. 8 months US surely based coordinating supply time. Wish could retire now. I'm 41. Granted I've saved close to, enough already retire decade, want keep adding pile. IIRC that's recent temp thing deal current outbreak. 2020 early 2021 Aussie friends enjoying bars, restaurants, concerts, etc almost zero cases. forced contact tracing + testing (you literally scan QR code contact tracing entering businesses), border locked tight, 2 week quarantine exceptions enter country reason, etc. every time outbreak happen entire region would lock 2 weeks outbreak finished everything opened again.

This time things bit significant. Delta good spreading among unvaccinated, lock downs need go longer lot tight, even still cases getting completely eliminated. AU/NZ well managing pandemic slow getting vaccines board lot population protection Delta. lesson learned woman wanted share rest country? Love neighbor—which good thought, getting vaccinated? 10$ says one cases everyone calls original name again. Everyone know says got ""The Pfizer"". Kinda like sane person calls Ford Mach E ""Mustang"". shown recovering infection give long lasting protection vaccine. plenty people caught COVID multiple times last year vaccine available. university requiring masking, social distancing. required attend multiple events many others auditorium. sure comfortable that. be?  Oh really? idea. TIL prefer covid classic thoughts this:

* Chinese gov't effective isolating controlling population reduce spread COVID-19. experience (see SARS non-health related segmenting population).
  * Chinese people likely countries listen gov't obey strictures. helps Chinese gov't maintain quarantines, even imposed city province level (for comparison, done Italy, similar less effective population ignored sneaked around get areas). Chinese population compliant, make conjectures.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

* necessarily trust **total** reported COVID-19 numbers come China. However, exactly distrust current reported case numbers, plausible given points above.
  * first part bulk COVID-19 infections occurred effective detection method existed. Testing COVID-19 December-February yet easy now, numbers accurately reflect total number active/hospitalized cases reported healthcare officials. necessarily reflect mild asymptomatic cases.
  * second part similar case numbers India (which probably much higher number reported, NYT good article it...although actually expect numbers China lower India even given higher population, re: first point active gov't quarantine), large population difficult (or, least, harder) find catch every case. (Sidebar: holds true country large population, USA included).

&amp;#x200B;

I think valuable lessons learned approach (and countries like Republic Korea Singapore's, etc.) handling COVID-19 pandemic countries (including USA, Brazil, etc.), also important remember works well one population might fly another (even within country!). 40pts, plus triple word score.  anyone explain everyone calls goalposts?

Nobody knows sure yet, unusual see 3-dose regimen vaccine, like Hep B vaccine. possible drugmakers simply know many doses needed prevent original variant sars-cov-2 now. Yeah every time I’ve talked hesitant, always seem concerned things due lack biology knowledge we’ve definitely learned last 18 months lot people don’t understand idea viruses spread grow. never got past initial attitude “it’s 15 cases going 0”. control one state large country despite state spreading cases states. 

We get it, think food shopping closed. experts disagree you. to? predict mandates. Something effect ""I'd take it, forced to"". Eh, combined effort.

Slowing help death rate every person critically ill hospitals hit capacity much likely die. slowing help. Masks, social distancing, vaccination etc.. keep numbers down.

The lethality us ~0.5% hospitalization rate 5%. hospitals full lethality rate rise towards hospitalization rate. really based want though? sounds like something company concluded testing boosters.

I agree would far productive pump many doses possible around world cant really see happening reason. Teacher here. want work students person. would love easier commute get there. 100% agree. I'm sorry, that's true. delta variant ripping vaccinated segments population similarly quickly. know four vaccinated people caught week. Japan used barely reach 1,000. remember 600 ""extremely high"" Tokyo, largest city world. gotten high one day, vaccines.... Wow. Maybe measured performance deliverables number hours location, could freedom without worry giving accountability. know, treat employees like adults adversaries. might even happier work! florida place I've lived first night there, instead happy, like ***""What hell get into?""*** company wants us go back restrictive WFH want us desk share. Blows fucking mind. Opposite lesson learned Covid. one might get results October. New hires, maybe fresh-outs, would biggest concern fully remote office. I'm impressed found way make work. public media terrible receiving messaging, creates feedback loop. honest answer questions is, “We don’t know sure,” media press definite. public expects health leaders know things certain, even certain data studies may even peer reviewed yet. 

Boosters great example this. science isn’t yet boosters healthy people, health leaders approving purpose, even though considerable debate whether that’s good idea. probably responding fear, driven news stories rare cases vaccinated people go hospital die, overwhelmingly people compromised immune systems. won't. Schools require 12 older soon approved, businesses same. available 12s long becomes like vaccines required. Yes, I’m certain still life humans haven’t quite figured that’s fear death. I've seen SARS-COV-1 asymptomatic spread able contained via symptom checks unlike SARS-COV-2 cannot contained symptom checks. get welded home ! helping reduce infection rate ! Also CT PCR measures viral RNA, virus. viral RNA ""dead"" virus. counting population, deads counted. Okay I'll extract data you.

From article:

55 percent infections, 80 percent symptomatic infection, 90 percent higher hospitalization,

“Those numbers actually good,” Dr. Murray said. “The group data would suggest boosters for, me, immunocompromised.”

----

So yeah like said, opinion would better see whole world vaccinated health people started getting boosters America wealthy countries. Immunocompromised different story. pull data way back start pandemic like everyone else? know even vaccines available everyone.

Since share data methodology I'll assume yes. socialist

Words, mean? mentioned above, natural infections less effective vaccines, Delta variant create lasting immunity. live SK 200 cases today. 
While number sounds low, look per capita numbers assume Ontario's population, Saskatchewan's cases would around 2400 today truly alarming. Saskatchewan basically lifted restrictions week full crazy summer events festivals, concerts, Riders game Ex broke all-time record attendance lol.
While wife fully vaccinated really worry two 5 yr olds who, even vaccine approved eligible likely long time, risk right due every moron walks around without mask attending events.
And province pretty much removed mandates, organizations supposedly cared employees health starting call everybody back legally can. Ridiculous You’re goddam right. stumble desk pj’s work kid sleeping lap? actually know teen doing, actually get share day family. time away choice now. don’t know people echo headline. many people can’t go get good office job easy peasy. company forced back office, choices either say quit/get fired spend months months looking good job hoping doesn’t take almost year like last two times find new job. Managers worry shortage workers soon they're terrible managers. Well aware. also know FDA recently (past two weeks) asked Pfizer safety data. I’m calling hand wringing think masks probably ""new normal"" anytime uncontrolled spread respiratory virus that's threatening overload healthcare system. think COVID threat degree indefinitely.

I empathize feeling defeat loss took granted pre-pandemic. guess feel hopeful COVID us forever. Washington already went back normal once, we'll definitely back again. 100% 

Being 50 times less likely die seems little better vaccine sugarpill blood donations Dec 2019 proof virus circulating January 2020. way cheaper solution traffic road construction. Better environment too. Heck, businesses worked collaboratively even give days week stagger employees minimize traffic, would reap benefits.  Yeah, get everybody excited; literally nothing changes legally.

There existing federal case law (The Texas Nurses case first comes mind).

Vaccination status protected class, therefore used basis discrimination.

There going big push vaccine mandates going increase vaccinations. one cared put mask

-Bane Boo hoo Makes sense sheer numbers people mingling much higher probably point 2020. soon CDC said unvaxxed could unmask, everyone understood mean pandemic over. go one biggest public health mistakes pandemic far USA concerned. mistake, meant mortality They'll literally anything isnt vaccine. Ctrl-F found ""childcare"" post, thats biggest factor think huge number workers ""desired"" employer.
 
If company talks coming back office, made good money everyone WFH ( company seems advertise record profits like COVID response planned years ago), I'm starting GREAT childcare service. High-end per hour pricing completely tied CEO's bonus. know job working home well, help make money employer, says gotta come in, well might well pass childcare cost employer too. 
 
Think bringing people back office, forcing many pay childcare, boss makes huge bonuses makes sense? It’s looking like Pfizer get emergency authorization October Middle managers probably terrified purpose monitor steer lower level employees. trusted level independence, like never needed all. Exactly. Seeing towards top page (relative normally seems get upvoted) extremely welcome breath fresh air fine train logic data shows seasonality argument legs. Areas country midwest huge COVID explosions summer winter 2020. truth this- nobody actually knows driving surges. Sure, masking, vaccinations, social distancing mitigate things, places little things happening yet experience surge, least yet. 

Everything know COVID based know now. Tomorrow, next week, next month...everything could change. best people err side caution stay masked long practical now. hope recovers fine doesn’t need hospital, I’m sorry friend One every 512 Americans died covid!?! reading right? also series economic congressional reports first half 20th century say that, advancements tech productivity, average worker would need work 15 hrs week century. 

Workers kept end bargain productivity increased substantially…wealth free time, however, shared worker wry equitably. 

If get 40hrs work done 15 pay salary leave alone remaining 25+ hrs Knew guy used buy fish antibiotics walmart took felt sick. Rednecks man... Good. Less unnecessary people roads morning. Except get without mandates government taken completely table. actually people trying get standard childhood immunization requirements taken away. going impose mandates never assumption would reach herd immunity especially given reinfection rates covid. wife works, everyone got covid bonus productivity went up. turns many people worked hours normally commuting during. 100% board this. also crave meeting new humans. Thanks! list complete. Google must combine counties even though NYT breaks down. numbers behind paywall. 

That's strange, right? could see combining 5 NYC boroughs, combine 4 leave 1 alone..it's weird. people unlucky :-( beginning images freezer trucks bodies, graves dug Hart Island people hazmat-type suits, etc.... still lot hidden, personally know people refused believe stuff real happening, still refuse believe it.

You point completely agree helps people see better understand. There's portion population living alternate reality though, know need exactly, think would increased transparency regarding dead dying covid. unsettling (to say least) encountering people.... Morbidity = going hospital… want employees listening music tuning people sitting cube.  never knew. know nasty chest cold *not* breakthrough.

It’s weird sick first time almost two years. don’t like one bit.  ""Bring yer dead!"" matter. new people office. people lifted restrictions early sent confusing messaging. re-opening schools time Delta peaking.
The fact previous admin made mistakes mean keep blaming forever, especially **mistakes still made**. Good.

I'll never understand need *""return normal""*

Pre pandemic normal something lunatic could come with. Idaho least beds per capita, fun fact. Damn right. tired whataboutism crap. two sides worth considering anymore. numbers article confusing

What 10,xx,xxx ? 1500 deaths past week? Never doubt Florida.. Ever.  projecting issues onto others like me. 

This one-in-a-lifetime pandemic many people can't recognize due normalcy bias. I'm tired gaslit reaction ""extreme."" not, especially causing trauma, all. accept might traumatize others, fine too. accept others react differently, also fine. People react way choose long hurt others. resilient people. Stop labeling me.

No, consider victim, sorry. I've luxury excellent mental health agency pandemic extremely productive consequence. Stop projecting victimhood well. I've getting really good coupon emails ulta used come around every months. $15 off, 20% off, $10 every week so.

Probably great 340-ish million us. course policies affect manufacturers. 340 million doses sent quickly places might make bigger difference third shots Americans. Especially given developed countries may also feel pressure provide third dose everybody people want one. 

I’m saying third doses wrong idea, accept decision impact, whether want not. Great use data.

Finally, I'd note even almost certainly understates efficacy. Why? even within age groups, older people tend vaccinated, course know age gradient COVID mortality. would suggest vaccines even 17x effective fully corrected age. Remote working saves money quite folks get work done. video conference ability long now?!?!? Waste money giant office buildings pay tons money furnish remodel them? thank you! Maybe nearly 100% vote mail superspreader event. Damn brother loves it. Really go office week everything laptop. He's moving new house Friday get work done Thursday get everything done instead going office. get work remotely home, take advantage much can. know employers sure hell beats paying $2000 $3000 flying worker putting hotel hour half meeting could done FREE Zoom. Business travel changed forever. WANT go back. miss seeing co workers even miss drive work. Throw podcast relax. vaccinated following precautions, honestly nothing sit back wait see vaccinated people start falling severely ill large numbers. Where'd hear that? hate people try argue sort intrinsic value meeting person. boss thinks ""will nice everyone"" meet face face office week. No, won't. People office people consider social circle. work people. together force mean inherently friend. I'm convinced people want go back office bosses want force social outlet cases one they've spent nearly every available hour work. hate work. like job well enough I'm good it, ton things life I'd like 8+ hours day, 5+ days week.

In closing, job house force office life? great man said: meaning life is, ""fuck place, let's go home."" hard see writing wall. live smallish mountain community outside large city.

Melbourne went hard lockdown still getting 70ish day company infrastructure team remote. aggressively moving virtual infrastructure. still support physical legacy servers 95% time handle issues remote. Unfortunately also means 24x7 support demands increased. type work probably never return office work. Why's problem? Employers save real estate costs high morale workers.

*We* country hurdle specifically something? *we* hurdle, there's generally hurdle. overwhelming majority people get shot get sick, we're problems idiots refusing take medicine. That's remarkably better months ago. learned necessary most? Saving s?  better quality f life still perform job?  pandemic, worldwide mind changing life moves forward all.  good thing eye astronomical storm.  pray adapt greater good. Change ways. Worldwide mind you. US problem. Early year, death count crossed half million, asked forum, ""will US cross 600,000 deaths?""

Most said yes, would last ""hundred thousand"" crossed (i.e. would cross 700,000).

In light Delta wave, think last hundred thousand now? Work sent us home permanently. offices allow return full time...only 2 days week. want us back lol Unfortunately that's option job. works company requires high levels security employees. office still job let team come back Covid over. great idea others though. ESPECIALLY jobs like programming there's really need working office. could stop pushing video calls, could truly devolve gremlin meant lol someone please help understand something? 


If countries around world, third world countries first world countries deciding put place restrictions lockdowns even table USA? make sense me; hospitals overrun shambles, schools constantly shutting down, people work whether covid contact either coworker kid school compensation like still arent even considering strict guidelines lockdowns? 


With new tests studies discovering vaccines nearly effective delta variant hoped still children cant vaccinated basically thrown wolves. seems like nobody even cares thinking rationally besides ""economy"". already dont enough people jobs lets kill bunch people even less, sure show economy ready go back normal! thing is, know lockdowns work subside virus, dropped dramatically last summer president got bored virus decided could back somewhat ""normal"". worst everyone got vaccination sits high horse thinks ""they part"" dont listen guidelines dont want lockdowns then, ""we punished unvaccinated"". anyone seriously think virus dead gone magically everyone US got vaccinated? 


Please dont berate hate lockdowns, help understand control them. thought whole point lockdowns last time hospitals overrun happening sudden dont care? Im confused, got vaccinations get booster available dont feel invisible it.  month cruise ship sink. yet, ban mask mandates fight vaccinations. Gods waiting room emptying soon No, viral *RNA* load, *viral* load. PCR measure viral load, measures viral *RNA* load. Viral RNA pieces virus destroyed t-cells macrophages, likely fully vaccinated person.

When judging strength army, dead soldiers? Wow, crappy post. Seriously. work already mandated mrna two dose vaccine newer ones MCAS responding faulty AOA sensors... I'm generally optimistic, feel much dread weekend. immunity waning looking like US fucked using 3 week interval doses instead longer one likely hesitancy many people getting booster shot considering barely get people get first 2 doses, feel like never end. Even B cells prevent severe illness death, going suffice people calling shots. grad program moved partially online despite student body 90% vaccinated. Everybody damn risk-adverse nothing short zero cases good enough many decision makers. can't fucking manage person, makes think could handle WFH. show middle management USELESS murderer? don’t believe support those. I’m part movement believes tolerance inclusion. means white, black, gays, short, fat, tall, Christians, Muslims, etc.

Yep! 8 weeks ago. Began looking 6 weeks ago, start new job (WFH whenever, spot office) week money. asked right questions time expectations hiring ease pressure need be.

Many participated Great Resignation recently, many actively looking. landscape changing companies adapt flounder. Damn pretty scary work home caused drop productivity, bringing back brought back pre-covid levels

we came back march, nearly 6 months already Extremely unlikely? I’ve heard one before. may ""purposely ignoring"" much ""doesn't apply them"". example, kid house, home office (as wife, WFH), I'm senior software developer (I'm expected get things done minimal/no supervision). really downsides me.

If younger, starting career, young kids would view *very* differently. Ask them. Imagine world households multiple adults require one car. would dope. 

I've put 11k miles car since bought Dec 2019 I'd probably get rid disabled/my city better public transit.  arrows quiver. think gotten away yet. this: """"The number need focus vaccination rate. get  
70% double dose vaccination rate ... treat Covid-19 like  
flu."" Really, no. pointerwhere Delta treated like flu, daeeadly far infections.us good night civilization wake call control middle management. It’s game over. talk manager? Maybe world would need. humans need pay penance earth somehow. cancer upon earth - upset mega-variant arise. deserve better, UK level regard sequencing.... Well, least, provided many us evidence *shouldn't* work for. Fortunately currently data suggest risk vaccine higher former.

This correct. understand keep discussions one safer? 100% agree. I’m preventing uncontrolled spread. Im thinking modeling point view - shouldn’t overconfident north. Winter coming. 

(Me dinner seriously hope jobs made home stay home. BS stay home still productive vs costs involve maintaining working office. I’m sure, could balanced previous infections, i.e. people vaccinated likely engage riskier behavior logic would also likely previously infected  don’t think it’s fault candidates employees. It’s employer asking relocate commute.


The candidates likely trying find job provide opportunity offers higher wages options available locally. Swine flu 2009 That’s great. Maybe people won’t opposed raising wages drive work. Like allowance leaving ones home. Hazard pay. Lol. go back? Work home consulting friends miss Starwood points airline miles can't wait travel work. positve outcome would also reducing CO2 emissions vehicles, would help ever-deteriorating climate. acceptable level death death imminent. Instead, it’s acceptable level risk. We, almost unconsciously, make choices daily driving car.  FDA approve it? Haha…drink kool-aid. 

Just encourage everyone think make personal best decisions. feel way honestly that’s choice. financial survive good you. us afford that. Man think months ago ready declare pandemic Working home future white collar work. pandemic sped up. company delusions FORCING employees back going hemorrhage talent. It’s already happening; people quitting instead going back: solution painfully obvious hurts. Treat people like adults let work choose. home, office, hybrid. Everyone wins. 

Also, let’s honest. People working home *increased* productivity shown unnecessary middle managers really are. That’s problem. bosses threatened. Yeah that's works. virus sentient. things evade things. used drive wife train (20 minutes), office (45 minutes).

I office 8 5 PM.

The drive office train night 60 minutes due traffic. usually wait 10-15 minutes train (if time, hit miss). 20 minutes drive home.

The entire day devoted getting work, work, getting home. exhausting.

Never again, help it. Middle managers lot lose comes WFH. They'll fight keep job.  sub wants lockdown decade more. Don’t bother. completely moved job (retail management) giant city rural mountain town large part commute.  2 hours day get back absolutely critical children. Yeah admit theres difference reading bullshit paper day consuming bullshit radio, tv, social media day long dumb ass compared education slavery. literally lack education used enslave people. dumb even realize already are. good news might able pick new lawn mower new furniture pretty soon next kin start selling That's sad reality, lot companies care never truly, stop plans state nudges them, whether lockdowns, incentives, etc.

Companies used obsessed micromanaging. stuff reading said someone suddenly becoming religious valid. Idk. know sure process actually lined out. people receiving 3 rd shots factor skew data? Same. company made us come back past March. probably sounds perverse, actually miss lockdown. got sleep hour later every day since commute, 5pm stood makeshift desk kitchen table home. FDA requires 50% efficacy rate. Period.  

I live completely normal life, wear mask mandated. advice needed sucks. New Orleans chronic medical condition need 2 procedures cannot get them. angry people caring others called ""rights"". office converted closet windows shoved 8 cubes into. it! agree - sad part isn’t yet, looks like ways go still... issue I've found flexibility WFH. expectation constant availability thing I'll give into, email phone, real work 6-630. I'm accountant there's really ""emergency"" can't wait. yet 15 hour, 6 days/ week people always working seem miffed this. quit job 2 months ago, asked right questions new job starts week. Employers adapt improve, perish, bummer took long, think labor renaissance upon us [The 7 day average deaths America That's little 1/3 worst ever got (3400).

Cases continue rise rapidly peak. continue get worse. much worse? seen scientific projections matter can't say, suspect 1500 least likely foregone conclusion. I’m introvert spend nearly time I’m working home (thats talking people online for!) work different story. I’m starting realize might I’m “work introvert” landed jobs working general public coworkers would simply allow option working home. I’m relationship don’t kids think it’s get livelihood… wonder much situation might different. bosses worried expose failings. different skill set effectively manage distance. Honestly nobody wants hear ton diseases circulate parts world people USA give fuck about. Covid going become one those. People FL saying too. keep asking list doctors nurses, yet get single name anyone. What’s reason younger adults much less affected Spanish flu? advanced modern medicine? job market redhot. company said appreciate you.

Im happy NZ better gods better here...  Exactly. absolutely despise Trump, reluctantly voted Biden, hoping he’d significantly smarter COVID trump. far, impressed Biden handled it. think relaxing mask mandate huge mistake done purely optics. again, places whose food good *because* hot crispy, table within minutes ready.

Bring mandates though. I’m hopeful end, long taking steps constantly move pandemic ☺️ need continue take constant measures lower spread! :) third vaccinated? 😳   feel bad kids. “Don’t seem help protect” implies think there’s low efficacy, seem backtracking favor far moderate frankly meaningless definition context words you’ve used. Reinfection possible common among unvaccinated people compared vaccinated folk even Covid classic dominant. Also nice sneaky edit make seem like source ready go I’m unreasonable.

Well earth overshoot day year already earth may able sustain people, western living habits never going 0% chance long COVID happen vaccinated. Would comfortable 0.76 chance 2% chance?

The work done reaching antivaxxers pandemic hit huge success rates, patience empathy paramount. work! exhausting stressful. please stop advocating shame. know work disparate groups.  vaccine actually slows spread it’s much harder infected. hard concept grasp people. 

Saying “it doesn’t stop spread” asinine know slows large degree. people hogging ICUs dying overwhelmingly unvaxxed. 

So yes, I’m legit thrilled well. Bring mandates don’t hear Facebook Docs like yourself. Fair. 

The flu shot example prevent getting flu, similar COVID vaccine, get subdued symptoms way lower chance hospitalization. 

The kicker is, although spread Covid still, viral load less. days incubation dramatically cut well. 

Get it. Don’t get it. It’s decision. base facts. also base decision may impact another person. There’s portion population can’t get vaccine. know kids extended family lost senses smell taste starting come back (sure didn’t get hospitalized sure got COVID). 

I didn’t get vaccine myself. I’m healthy young enough take risk. can’t risk someone’s grandparents getting me. someone’s kids. Even don’t get hospitalized. I’m selfish. It’s job. It’s tested. Read statistics. media moguls website medical bodies publish make informed decision. comment brought 1-800-Collect case Medicare. set rates procedures typically less private insurers negotiate. That's docs accept Medicare.  meanwhile US claim events like lollapalooza sturgis measurable spread. antivaxers still ""it's flu"" argument, can't really acknowledge existence long covid yet.

The flu, many viruses, cause long-term problems argument hold water. Bruh.

I’m quite confident Pfizer much larger marketing department Moderna. SpikeVax better name US sure. It’s American give generic direct English name. Pfizer’s name might actually better global distribution. Whatever, go go go, take nurses everyone you.     Doesn’t anything nothing change mind.

I’m still shocked musician friends refuse get vaxxed. substantial protection, good vaccination. may still get sick, they're much less likely serious consequences. Ok, Biden, make mandatory.  Unfortunately humane way already, kept everyone inside vaccine available. Due fact herd immunity end goal, order reach 85-95% immunity required herd immunity need people become immune. push vaccines comes point people believe nature science stopping us reaching eradication COVID, choice let nature take course.

It sounds absolutely horrible options unless start sniping people vax shots, value medical freedom lives family friends, going start paying cost freedom, many already have. wonder applies people reserves too. 

You tour, you’re home part reserves. Well need get vaxxed…

This could apply lot people. Like, hundreds thousands. \~30% nurses.

Let get straight: Delta started spreading widely late June. So, entire conceit that

1. summer
2. two months
3. environment that's \~70% vaccinated
4. PPE expected worn

That every unvaccinated nurse catch COVID already, non-issue?

Because feel like really grasp recently Delta started spreading.

Basically FDA told company they've done everything right vaccine safe. can't turn around hold company responsible FDA's duty make sure drug safe. They're protected cases misconduct. experience here, got morning could feel side effects ramp throughout day peak night. Struggled sleep, felt perfectly fine morning Jesus face value sure, upon research (something anyone making medical decision) EUA entails they'd learn face value misleading - logical conclusion get vaccinated safe. 1. delta spreading fast is, 2 months plenty condensed cities - forgotten New York City Wuhan?

2. summer nurse?

You know don’t work outdoors right?

Well vaccines work intended winter terrible see 🤥 eight months late though. reaction 4 years Trump egging supporters hurt insult anyone them.  think they'd update website now, getting approved FDA huge: says needs space work that's separate lives

This seems like good opportunity move (especially since commute longer matters) get place another bedroom used office. house allowed work home easy get feeling separation walked home office end day. Comirnaty hanging hardcore. got sympathy. daughter made 3 days currently quarantining awaiting test results. Wait, thought telling us get classroom unvaccinated last year get terminated? *variants entered chat* Yes give validation anti vax crowd...who either move goalpost admit safe. don’t think that’s valid concern? 

There long term data. looked forward casual conversations co-workers, mentorship sessions managers periodic, freewheeling chats — known “teatime” — office kitchen.

Sounds like reason co-workers want continue work home. family cannot vaccinated.  healthy people pay unhealthy people time? people take vakkks choice. people eat Subway think they're making smart choices. get paid for. biggest logistical challenge time then?

Yes, exactly. mean look China... article post claims Covid zero. accomplished using quick effective measures... could applied entire world record, I'm trying shit you

It's cool, apologize came condensing. honestly made cuff comment expecting spark people fail realize, though, lives take granted depend lot people get near enough credit keeping society functional.

I agree medical professionals scientists get enough credit... mean unvaccinated parts US really highlight point. But, see comment plays individuals Zealand isolated island population \~4.9 million

And world isolated planet space? get point. proposing (idealistically hindsight) global approach Covid measures. countries NZ successfully managing surprised combination Delta

Delta issue scenario... Think Delta came first place. came uncontrolled spread original virus. approach virus would never allowed get far.

Now, approach legal actually practical countries world Probably not. Hence ""humans going human"" comment. merely pontificating **IF** could gone 4 week quarantine, much better things would be.

Edit: typo Insurance companies, next.

They mandate it, actuaries crunch numbers charge people get vaccine higher premiums. expect monthly payments increase 10%.  Nothing really could get intra-nasal vaccine, could change things. million dollar question right here. state? Comirnaty sounds like something bad would happen community Pfizer’s longest testing period durning clinical trials one month. say that’s “a lot data”? assume people can't get one health reasons exceptions made prob able go get 4th/new formula point long lasting Kids 8-11 even know covid get it. Emergency use authorization legal?  Probably Congress, elected. entirety execution branch, possible, unless Congress pass law says otherwise lot schools windows open! Oh long enough time ago longer concerned. really 48 hour nightmare. Crazy lasted long! Everyone's constitution different. IMO takeaway, new consensus early days pandemic, researchers proposed main route SARS-CoV-2 transmission either via large droplets people exhaled projectile motion coughs sneezes via surface contamination. Recent work, however, uncovered virus particles also infect others via long-range long-range spread bioaerosols, droplets particles smaller 5 micrometers. makes problematic terms risk exposure remain suspended air extended periods move air Jimenez recommended teachers school staff wear N95 masks elastomeric half-masks school. younger children, said, Korean KF94 masks elastomeric masks may better option. ... also stressed importance providing masks low-income people cannot wear masks, lunch, ideally take place outdoors, added.

So (a) relying six-foot distancing, plexiglass dividers, etc., discredited thinking, (b) close-fitting, high performance masks N95 filters new norm. Ok cool covid going away.... experts saying become endemic. always cases think previous poster alluding fact shot isn’t given children (under 12?) almost zero data. Yeah, I'm really disappointed nothing done lunches kid's school. There's big covered area outside size lunchroom, instead continuing hold lunch indoors cafeteria. ok, claim.

They could easily pushed fiscally conservative stimulus plan would've pleased donors: tying spending pre-pandemic earnings, making payments directly employers furlough workers 80% wage, etc, like UK did. earned $2,000/mth pandemic got $1,600/mth now, kept job. 

It would fair, good businesses, incentivised people remain work, cost taxpayer far less US government ended going with. whole bunch conservative/moderate democrats would've crossed aisle make happen. republicans play *all marbles*, trying stop spending, something anyone brain could see would catastrophic America. left democrat plan.

If one republican's super-wealthy backers, I'd absolutely furious them. Way give away ball game.  messaging slow place. serious virus? unvaccinated major threat public safety? 

If not, let’s stop theatrics. 

If is, mandatory vaccinations/testing taking long? unvaccinated allowed work positions public trust?

Why aren’t politicians leading front making mandatory vaccinated public sector? bold decisive leadership? Huh? I'm saying deadlier virus would get attention 90 percent skeptics pressure mandate imprison would quick. 

Imagine said going get rabies passes air spreading 20 days prior symptoms 100% fatal. 

There ONE would go dumb stuff thought could die. many people think gonna calling Comimaty vaccine? well. hope stop spread winter starts. doubt tracking mechanism place. ओला Shulgin  vaccines prevent getting disease. still get spread covid covid vaccine...

Breakthrough infections happen vaccines. 

The vaccine's goal prevent disease. goal save lives prevent severe disease. vaccine effective preventing death severe disease. Breakthrough infections milder thanks vaccines. also reduce transmission rates promote herd immunity important people eligible vaccination.

Mandates save lives prevent severe disease. UVA's student vaccinated, Coy said. Around 1% students currently unvaccinated **1.3% allowed claim religious medical exemptions**, Coy said.

This good news, religious exemptions vaccination utterly backwards exist all, especially now. based science easy anti-vaxxers exploit, even mandates.  safety obvious, people waiting paperwork officially done?

Perhaps someone else blame  find frustrating measures new rules place, simple act opening windows leaving open feels like climbing mountain. grim Canada, doubt grim US. true, CDC making everyone get tested multiple times strictly locking down? Delta rampant United States, right?   Yeah doofus also get hit head stray meteor die. Thinking probably explains helmet worth Covid?   saying HR circle jerk nonsense. mean exact opposite? Florida imposes restrictions - China's strict. Florida believe anyone tells told - Chinese citizens exactly government tells good ill. saw nothing paid sick leave bad side effects.

""We offer vaccine here""....and round round go. treatments thinking of? support this. Even pay remaining townspeople help acclimate them. Dude. nucleotides difference sequence thousands.

Good luck thank trying part solution!  Problem see wave people getting first dose, may think vaccine hesitant people getting vaccinated getting second doses may affect policies planning. US (not sure rest world), 2005 PREP act, unless demonstrated “willful misconduct”, major vaccine manufacturers given blanket immunity liability. protection lasts least 2024. 

You also can’t sue FDA employer mandated severe reaction.

Congress start fund help cover lost wages and/or out-of-pocket medical expenses 2010, less 6% (as Dec 2020) claims paid fund. mean calling Pfizer BioNTech actual work.

I'm atheist (though I'm truculent it), important get religious people vaccinated try convince religion dumb.

I believe major world religions heartily endorsed promoted vaccination members. funny ones (Christian Science, various cults, etc) (some of) splinter groups fundamentalist sects major ones problem, well ones tie religious identity reactionary political worldview. Even mormons, tend politically conservative, endorsed vaccinations. mormon leader encouraging flock get vaccinated get vaccinated true believer atheist telling they're backwards.  net neutral anyone. risk long covid complications young people like 2 orders magnitude higher long term complications vaccines. also help reduce spread lot, vaccinated people less likely catch first place, do, shed virus less time. company Covid sick pay.

Yeah, covers oldest (and thus usually sickest) part population. kid HS said masks required, zero social distancing, kids bumping hallways along overcrowded cafeteria.
They (kids) betting long take large scale quarantine kicks in. Current bets 2-3 weeks  biggest issue see entire article complete absence talking strain medical infrastructure facing. attitude mostly, ""Don't push vaccines certain groups risk severe disease low"".

That matter delta. sheer numbers game. Let's say 0.05% severe covid vs 0.01% severe vaccine reaction holds true. youth population 1 million, translates 500 100 kids respectively. huge amount. However, hospitals areas house 1 million youths 200 beds, much larger problem hands. hospital system absorb 100 youths sick. struggle find methods treat 300 extra people. mention daily accidents illnesses still part lives.

When hospitals close 100% capacity many locations, vaccines need pushed harder. circumstance patient health alone sole factor determining get vaccine. numbers game seems many people losing sight forest examining trees.

Yes, demanding vaccines arms necessarily needed individual basis. counter 20% reduction current cases would allow people receive proper care.

The biggest take-away pandemic we, species, need think communities first, instead individual selves. Calling Pfizer like saying iPhones Foxconn phones. Thank this! incorrectly assumed Co stood Covid.  also he's Spicoli makes ok me! ""diabeetus"" pronunciation ""community"" humans, far know, [coronavirus infect brain causes damage means, explained article above. main reason ACE2 receptor virus uses enter cells really expressed much brain cells. bat brains, I'm certain, response cells different ours. video certainly looks like that's what's happening, expertise say sure that's we're seeing there. Standing village square shouting “we’re fucked matter do!” isn’t helpful.

This article that. strives help people understand (among things) behavior modifications (e.g. masks, limited indoor gathering) productive even among vaccinated. overwhelming people die covid, least US, people refuse get vaccinated. right, since made decision, live consequences. concerned deaths? 

Back question, curious whether China's zero covid strategy (or less) disruptive people's lives, compared permissive attitude taken US Europe. It’s difficult impossible. Cite credible sources take anecdotal evidence grain salt. 

Most people want live life take care family enjoy them. microphone say whatever get rich. 

This situation real. Small towns major breaks chose latter. go mechanic fix car, go dentist fix teeth. experts dedicated career specifically understand viruses combat them. Maybe listen more.

You free get vaccinated hospital free hire people willing get vaccinated. limits numbers store spacing requirements. 

You know we've already done twice right? 1 case vs 17 cases = 1 - 1/17 = 94.12%

Which matches stated efficacy phase 3 trials (95% overall, 94% people age 65).

The whole 99%/100% effective hospitalisation/death always exaggeration.  

The trials weren’t big enough show that, 10 severe cases (9 unvaccinated group, 1 vaccinated group). don’t understand people felt need exaggerate first place.  (95% great!) pro-vaxxers, should’ve understood tempering expectations would lead resentment.  suspect exaggerators mostly anti-lockdown anti-mask types, wanted go back normal ASAP. \#GladysVariant

No matter important think government action people allowed protest it. Nice classist remark. people I’ve worked good job work top global company based Europe. Ten times less likely die significant factor celebrated such, although continue mask sensible keep distances. Oh wow, kudos him! never possible. Good, gives people chance move up. So…you’re also saying black urban democrats murderers well. Right? leading NYC refusing vaccine? think black urban Democrats also murderers using logic. Right? tiny. you’re vaccinated, they’re vaccinated, go give hug. I’m sure they’ve missed you. Can’t believe sub considers 0.0099% entire 4.5 million people tested positive *case* COVID-19 considered “real serious.”

Of course, may well criticisms papers too. never good idea link paper must answer question.

it's hard leave good job someone put 2x front would hard logically convince leave table. You’re probably categorising things wrong senses, nearly everyone uses words incorrectly.

Taste just; salty, bitter, sweet, sour Unami/savoury.  feel different parts tongue.

Hot/spicy isn’t taste.  It’s triggering pain heat receptors, specific taste receptors.

Anything like floral, citrusy, pungent (smelly cheese) rotten/off sense smell.

So lost 100% smell kept 100% taste could eat lemon would still sour, wouldn’t get citrus aroma helps know lemon.  Things would different, it’d technically due smell taste.

You try holding nose, eating different things noticing feel tongue.  That’s sense taste. (Well, technically taste texture - pure experiment you’d blend everything first.) part whole “eating experience” it’s really tiny compared comes smell.  it’s definitely separate thing. NSW first place Delta outbreak. whole world already knew contagious Delta was, incubation period shorter, virus shed person symptomatic.

Health experts premiers every state implored NSW lockdown limousine driver case knowing Delta changed rules.

Yes, unlikely work way given rest world vote elections countries could give boosters help. people resisting vaccinations hardly likely swayed Sean Penn, people. anything heels even more. protest covered pigshit piss street might arrest too. still wouldn’t protesting. isn’t good faith Indeed strikingly 84% antibodies post infection RBD area virus could confer larger protection RBD area always assume people mouth breathers self aware enough know it. “How going breathe Covid nose nose doesn’t work air conduit anyway?” agree more! like said, wait quite time savings. leverage extremely high - house, car, kids, nothing; money currently mine spend. like it, I'll find something else year maximum.

Congrats new life situation. People like take answer going influence shitty work culture better! getting vaccines now. let go vaccines arrived. locked another two months vaccines catch up.  working theory nurses resistant shot administration though. Nurses aren’t paid enough, don’t get take breaks, way many patients given day, still get shit patient surveys. Many enough think hill they’re willing die gain leverage administrations refuse fix broader issues within hospital systems protect profit margins. Good bye job. Quit spreading misinformation kills people. 

If anti-vax healthcare charged endangerment.  Thank conceding, correct. think one main potential premature conclusions whether vaccines post infection truly clinically significant basing decisions solely RBD limited analysis RBD plasma RBD antibodies strongly correlated neutralizing activity3,10,11,12.

This MRNA vaccines targeted, know natural infection 84% antibodies RBD parts theory vaccines help boost immunity, whether RBD specific immunity huge factor reinfections still speculation point. 

And gran scheme things vaccines still finite resources really imagine entire world needs immunity whether natural vaccinated, could let previous infections wait everyone else got shot would bring herd immunity quicker (if herd immunity even possible). 

You’re right though it’s absolutely crazy aren’t talking it.

But MPH program taught write issue briefs 3-5th grade reading level. 8000 level epidemiology class actually part grade professor put paper grade test make sure extremely simple. room nuance like reinfections, convalescent etc. it’s shame can’t stick science understand reasoning.  think KFC usage makes sense. ""Hey, pursue high-risk unhealthy diet already, double even higher-risk meal option?""

When politicians caught stealing start denial, evidence released, still ""double down"" sticking original denial narrative. usage makes sense.

""Doubling down"" reaffirming stance, sticking plan continuing path even risks increase. Presumably rewards great. person stubborn. both.

The author headline seems idea term means use it. Unless there's extra dimension backstory referenced article. New York make anybody refusing get vaccinated wear Red Sox t-shirt work every day do. numbers meaningful without normalizing population also looking things like test positivity. RemindMe! 2 months  Yes, that's physically barricaded people homes start pandemic. I'm sure paid well minor inconvenience. /s It’s government keeping us home, disease.   sure, change jobs want bigger pay increases. everyone wants change jobs every 2 3 years though. 

Also, changing jobs every two years, exceptions, become yellow flag HR hiring managers. great. rest world crap.  read linked? talks INNATE immune response end even states solutions vaccines. So... Durham here. are. anything believe disbelieve.

The fundamental question is:

*Is moral healthy, young people rich countries receive third shot elderly high risk people poorer countries get single shot?*

I think clear right answer ""NO.""

But anyways, offered booster might well take it. People NZ saying true. Yeah hybrid meetings definitely work well. need everyone there, everyone remote.    think replying wrong comment.

How antivax/science denying saying mandates going start (dominoes going fall) fda approval here?

I confused. point, changing people's minds. limiting liability company organization mandates vaccination.

I hope we'll see tidal wave companies saying, ""get vaccinated tested weekly."" month weekly tests, folks opt vaccine, point choice.   like magic, millions ""I'm waiting approved"" folks totally different reason getting vaccinated. aunt way. anti vax every fashion... kids grandkids get vaccines. them. going 2 weeks hospital. God never thanks doctors keeping dying.

I'm Christian, come on. surely means people referring “experimental” excuse getting making appointments now, right? agree think well. I'm mom teenage Zoomer reminds references old I'm funny. (but am)
Plus, Gen x can't resist good self burn already know next move going “it rushed fast.”  imagine terrible impact Polio would hundreds thousands (if MILLIONS) american children 40% americans refused Polio vaccine? pure ideological selfishness nurtured decades People area walking Targets CVS stores getting boosters. It’s easy area apparently someone US, even close. AUS done great job managing pandemic point. 

People AUS afraid. want someone blame. anger based fear. Religious exemptions need go away permanently.  Great news! 100% expect goal posts shift anti-vaxxers though expect people it, people sick tired it. I'm saying effective it. even religiously. often masked, useful is.

You say sometimes wearing makes whole thing useless. useless. Wonder express lane owners/profiteers putting pressure anyone get cars back road. would assume projected revenue dropped significantly since Covid began.

Correct, home quarantine China. people

not allowed visit. entire world would quarantined 4 weeks early 2020

So people stock four weeks supplies? guess they'll starve.

Also, would good without running water, heat, electricity? suggesting work, people would stay home, too.

Oh, emergency services. None those. Heart attack? Fire? Best wishes you. one's coming save you.

And say, ""but *those* people would allowed out,"" ""the entire world"" quarantined. Awesome! mandate shit it. friends waiting - getting Pfizer vaccine! Honestly, found many unsure opting J&amp;J, don’t hear lot vaccine anymore. know Pfizer marketing, seems odd checked doctor? Sounds like ""ehrmahgerd! protect yer comirnaty!""  -lol, 40% america science filled uncertainty bullshit news headline. Shameful click bait approach sensationalism based journalism. docs suggested 8 weeks. minimum suggested recently 28 days either pfizer moderna depending case mixing. fact EUA 12-15 year olds means schools still going reticent mandate anyone 16. little disappointing. think Sweden going herd immunity. definitely nothing though, I'm sure country nothing. surely significant impact attitudes anti-vaxxers, shift opposing vaccine ""because approved"" opposing vaccine ""because approved quickly."" Fair enough. I’m trying understand there’s difference Pfizer 1 2 3. assume 1 3 based did? blames citizens it, fact. Certainty. risk.  Moderna approved next week. gets approved expect see employers mandating also expect see lot social venues start mandating well plus expect insurance companies start raising costs unvaccinated well. Youll probably see full vaccination mandated spring semester, meaning gotta start within next couple months downvotes really interesting considering quoted valid scientific study good numbers. suggests messages, apart media fear mongering ones, acceptable regardless accuracy truth. worrying time many us, rational, friendly discussion becomes impossible. immunocompromised likely yes regardless latest approval. Assuming vaccinated mRNA vaccine (Pfizer Moderna) begin Needs Additional COVID-19 CDC recommending moderately severely immunocompromised people receive additional dose. includes people have:

* receiving active cancer treatment tumors cancers blood
* Received organ transplant taking medicine suppress immune system
* Received stem cell transplant within last 2 years taking medicine suppress immune system
* Moderate severe primary immunodeficiency (such DiGeorge syndrome, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome)
* Advanced untreated HIV infection
* Active treatment high-dose corticosteroids drugs may suppress immune talk healthcare provider medical condition, whether getting additional dose appropriate current recommendation get vaccine got first time. Okay, think misunderstood me. linking paper *made* argument me, linking paper described examples virus evade immunity beyond mutations spike. example, virus several mechanisms impeding host immune system. Another example mutation allows virus ""*disguise*"" spike many ways coronavirus es evade INNATE immunity. 

This distinction meaningless. vaccine prepares inmate immune response, still host immune system work. I'd imagine puts label usage/prescriptions vaccine table, 12 crowd? Witchcraft Nurse too. think reasoning runs deep. anti vax nurses dumb and/or crazy nurses. would classify nurses hot mess. 

Also nurses take good care themselves. They're bad, worse average person. I've help multiple coworkers ground fell get up. ""Nobody saw I'm gonna start neuros ya."" 

The likely, simplest answer nurses flawed everybody else. Perhaps due stressful job. actually learn education experience. nursing school nurse. Nursing attracts sorts people. commonality endure backbreaking work, elbow deep shit, smells mortal nostril ever subjected to. nurse mentally challenging. test ability give fuck. hope years prison worth sad part bunch different excuses conspiracies, time one gone seamlessly replace another. other. many choose from. get pick choose excuses, don’t need use them. see virtually one immunity NZ incredibly vulnerable.  Amazing news hopefully change things better quickly. Although course can't wait see come now. So.......we long line unvaxxed get shot starting today? I'm guessing not. hope I'm wrong. must look good all. Act like dumbass, get treated like dumbass probably constructive recognize similarities argue generation got shafted harder. Nah. Got zero 700 cases day last year. Got zero several smaller outbreaks since, including delta, re-introduced NSW. 

This totally preventable. 

We chance get significantly vaccinated population experiencing widespread infections, stuffed one Premier decided ignore facts. said!!! live close Walmart home office mandated vaccines get fired course hundreds idiots protesting weekend front it. Absolutely amazing. mandate fuck it. Fighting good fight rest us, thank you. Ok disagree. It’s simple vax X% take measures limit spread ie masks social distancing. Lockdowns implemented sliding scale great effect simply help alleviate pressure healthcare system. let rip 70% vaxxed idea also fails account fact it’s 70% certain population group isn’t typically including children make significant portion overall population. economics priority I’d taking second consider economic implications allowing rampant covid infections minor population resulting deaths god knows long term effects.

What happens teacher already got Johnson Johnson vaccine? go get Pfizer one compliant ? “They bribed fda.” “Deep state Jewish lasers lobby “ That’s moon! It’s COVID vaccine fridge! biggest problem vaccinated everyone throwing masks away.

Yooooo hello everyone keeo hoping sil one them, wears mask, kept excuses put vaccinations kids. latest fda approved. need context understand bad Gladys fucked up.

 Australia zero cases pandemic.In mid June, driver transported air crews airport accommodation - required wear mask vaccinated - picked delta strain. Whereas state premiers locked states immediately odd outbreak leaked overseas quarantine system, Gladys instead resisted basically due ideological differences premiers adoration she'd received press [Woman Saved chiefly never locked Sydney past instead relied health departments contact tracing team quarantine individuals instead.

Queue two weeks pleadings stay home, mask mandates public transport, highly inefficient suburb-based lockdowns, beast bolted barn. We're experiencing highest amount daily case rises ever, contact tracing team completely swamped irrelevant, deaths increasing, NSW going ongoing lockdown probably 5 months.

If Gladys made choice lockdown soon limo driver picked delta, 2/3rds country plus NZ would either lockdown experienced lockdown, 60+ people would alive today.

And entire fucked situation fault.

Mostly older workers died, disabled covid, bailed retired early. massive workforce shortage. Realizing able negotiate 30% raise last month notoriously cheap company.

""I'm waiting MODERNA vaccine approved!"" /s TIL Covid Vaccines aren't/weren't FDA approved, sure they've time okay already care, say something like ""well FDA government can't trust them...they legalized alcohol can't trust them"".

But fully vaxxed....you really fine, precautions.

Just need actually care peoples lives take time life reach people help show vaccines vital take immediately, showing diagrams vaccine works show safe is. -Its showing someone understand vaccine works - lack knowledge -misguided. antivax, yeah, force vaccination - may understand - gonna keep alive leave - need keep keep showing reaching explain explain explain - show thorough diagrams, videos exactly vaccine works, show literally microchips, show substance vial merely contain vaccine substance reacts body cellular level force body produce antibody substance attacks virus. 

If you, misguided. Imagine misguided getting hurt suffering dying misguided - meanwhile hateful people wanting much die. die? nothing. literally disappearing. Life gone. -As opposed perhaps someone actually cared forcefully vaccinate perhaps actually knew reach show right thing do. perhaps actually changed understand right all. Imagine changed deeply misguided antivax.

EVERYONE MUST get technology. Care everyone's life able get technology. -Stuff like Neuralink example. letting people disappear forever? gone? meanwhile living totally selfish life hoping people die due lack knowledge? - need help everyone understand care everyone's life - keeping EVERYONE alive well.

While government said require EUA vaccine pandemic, area law tested little bit. 

Requiring fully approved vaccines solid legally. Businesses afraid potential litigation requiring COVID vaccine longer need be.  I’ve worked law firms trying help develop fixed fee strategies. firms absolutely cannot adopt work slowly. though find could actually make firm money increase client satisfaction so. It’s amazing many still refuse adopt sort fixed fee offerings. fucking time  kind thought bringing outside cleaning staff disinfect surfaces knew rare COVID spread surfaces pretty bad. ..... plague doctor would good Eh, little complicated acknowledging passage time.

Nope. personally risk great… people stop using excuse going find another one? always called Comirnaty(Atrocious name), I've never heard anyone call anything ""Pfizer"" ""The Pfizer Vaccine"" ... fuck people taking!?!  quickly vaccine work destroy it? Instant? Hours? Days?

There timeline. vaccine like taking ibuprofen head-ache. vaccine teaches immune system recognize fight thing vaccine immunizing against.

Your immune system still what's fighting virus. works perfectly, basically never get sick even catch virus, immune system kicks shit experience symptoms virus got ass whooped leaves body via waste.

However, vaccines working perfectly. still improve chance fighting thing vaccinating against. immune system still fight virus, reality everyone's immune systems different. 

How overworked you? hydrated? many nutrients body? much sleep get? fighting infections? lot cause *variables* change effective immune systems are. That's one cold knock ass week another cold super easy walk off. mileage may carrier infect others?

Whelp reading that... we're going lot treat pandemic related PTSD large portion population. 

You totally right makes comfortable find disturbing many people subreddit talk like this. Look profile COVID COVID seemingly months (or years). 

It's like looking mirror me, regarding long term experience GAD OCD. hope things get better sake, physically mentally.  two kids twelve, we’re eagerly awaiting vaccine approval them. meantime, I’ve trying decide sensible strategy:

A) Maximum safety: 

They go inside building absolutely necessary, bearing mind school starts soon, they’ll spending set amount time indoors every day fall vaxxed. schools require vaccinations eligible adults, masks mandated. plan would remain place kids fully vaccinated.

B) Medium safety:

They wear well fitted, high quality masks times indoors, start resume indoor activities like going grocery shopping sometimes, stuff like that.

The “A” option seems like obvious choice, start contemplating possibility pandemic going like another 2-3 years. happens, better learn live hard core masking jump, able resume sense whatever new normal moving forward. kids young, may well face pandemics course lives.

Along mass shootings, pandemics something kids ready for. Simultaneously.  like... entire life revolve around job... get actually live life way want advisements annual flu shot COVID booster? booster shot October, right around time get annual flu shot. take each?  type ironic comment I'm vaccinated understand?  immediately effect around half million military members yet vaccinated. Nah aerosols dangerous. commute adds stress consumes energy too, lack recreation. Good point though. mean, maybe portion really super specialized job repleceable really holds cards. strong suspicion median white collar job irrepleceable WFH makes proximity workplace personal connections irrelevant may bad surprise. 

Even shipped India, they'll shipped American lives cheaper area parents take lower salary. know hospital worker trying claim religious exemption whose pastor vaccinated….I hope employers investigate religious exemptions determine official position vaccines local religious leaders sort broader policy. leader pipeline vaccinated, excommunicated, invalidate “religious exception” everyone religion. That's keep telling boss keep saying ""you're welder though"" answer lot questions topic various forums.

Sincerely,
A Covid medical biller Lol. CDC case study 500 people. Literally one knows long vaccine work. sit tell it’s 100% going last immune system. vaccine good everyone says it’s is, maybe 3rd 4th booster shot might work. You’re blind anti vaxx. information, one does. Imagine releasing drug, giving 500 person case study mark concussive data. Mask mandates barely suggestions point, people aren’t following them. I've recruiters reach promising jobs, scratch heads say, ""I'm interested fully remote."" amazing stupid corporate people are. don’t get free catered lunches full cafeteria? pay lunch snacks ever get tested? Cool, less real estate overhead companies. Winwin Boomers people forcing everyone back first link showing 66% efficacy preventing cases, 73% efficacy preventing hospitalization.

That's especially highly protective. known mask recommendation removed, way hell ever going come back.

They known something true? Mask mandates coming back back many places. Exactly. It’s blatantly obvious. Especially leaders know what’s happening work. know weeks folks staff might work 25-30 hours. times grind 60-80 hours. dictate flow meet commitments. me, that’s sweet spot. Set expectations make reasonable. Let people fly. interesting thing use mathematical probability argument say vaccines approved kids. inverse mathematical argument could also made, children largely deal COVID without much trouble. Sure don’t, they’re major exception. arguably need *rush* vaccine group people least need vaccine. 

To clear, I’m vaccine children. toddler plan get vaccinated. use numbers make point want, reality loads factors consider rolling vaccine jabbed millions kids arms kids *mostly* handle COVID fine. worried Lambda variant? heard earlier outcompeted Delta vaccines still work hear people saying worse Delta vaccines work. know. go Charlotte enough really say one way other, Knoxville ain't good, that's sure. Remote work may working fine danger comes companies start turn completely reaches point almost everyone working hired covid work home experiment. Innovation point start diminish working relationships strong first cohort employees knew prior working home.

One insightful quotes read WFH “When lose connections, stop innovating. It’s harder new ideas get groupthink becomes serious possibility.” ### long job's done, complain.  They’re worried far many middle managers exist office building jailkeepers. office = reason exist. Yeah, no. always fight fot promotions. matter remote. anti-vaxxers fed misinformation. keep reading post FB vaccinated patients one dying.

Success story hope good times keep going you! I'm thankful worked everyday since covid started I'm vaccinated I'm worried, still careful rather pretending everything back normal. know there's reasonable chance I'll infected point next years. want boost immunity much then, meaning likely booster shot next year, variant-specific vaccine one become available necessary.

Good. Lmao US “didnt give fuck” covid back started Wuhan far away infects Asians. happen next shock ! Gamers ""collaborating"" strictly remotely long time achieve complicated team based goals. find studies? COVID best thing career date. productivity doubled due WFH, led new job I’m making double used to. Thank virus! wish companies would stop using word “collaboration” reason go back. That’s video chat.  Researchers studied first people become infected Delta strain Mainland China found individuals viral loads 1,000 times higher time diagnosis, compared individuals infected original strain virus. (We wrote study last month.) CDC reports virtually identical PCR cycle threshold (Ct) values test specimens vaccinated unvaccinated individuals part Provincetown many interpreted result indicating vaccinated people become infected Delta variant infectious unvaccinated people infected, Ferullo others urge caution. “It’s important remember **PCR test detects viral RNA, infectious virus. Detectable viral RNA doesn’t necessarily correlate infectiousness**. way determine individual infectious would culture specimen. means inoculating virus cell culture see grow,” bosses want people working home? saves companies money less internet bandwidth less office space pay people constantly working overtime convenient think people think way we'll back office eventually.

That's factually wrong lol getting normal view redditors exact type people want stay home beneficial economically environmentally use work force social interaction onto people required nice people I've talked IRL significantly less productive working home. worked home three months honestly accomplish evidence, factually wrong, thanks telling us child incapable working without adult around supervise lol. get positive human interaction get office employees forced friendly pain looking like less team player, would better found hobby instead trying force people use decades obsolete work model lol. actually specific though it? say fully vaccinated group.

Either way, point vaccinated absolutely cratered chances adverse outcome due catching COVID. That's pretty much it.  3 year old problem wearing mask start pandemic (he 2 then). 

His younger brother, 2 June, fights tooth nail. Can’t keep quick grocery run try things. 

This person isn’t saying it’s unsafe wear it, getting difficult.

2 year olds don’t get like 3 4 year olds. 2 year olds way better 4 year olds. know. absolutely is. one thing ""new normal"" want normalized, least hybrid form.

No commutes, able sleep also free time too. able use free time able spend time friends, things opened we've able compared winter (when complained WFH realizing WFH winter normal WFH would operate). I'm one socialize co-workers, Reddit introvert rather I'd rather spend time socializing friends family co-workers (ie people actually care about), able WFH god send respect well. 

Companies really want WFH want justify rent paying offices, also middle-managers want feel like reason nothing forcing employees work office even tangible benefit able act like middle manager. whole ""butts seats means better productivity"" bullshit something middle managers subscribe en masse, make feel better job responsibilities have. Also people absolutely social lives outside co-workers.

Hopefully though least hybrid WFH becomes normal. go middle week meetings whatnot, Mondays Thursdays/Fridays WFH. would allow way people hate job miserable work people usually are. I’m hoping we’re half time least  know people got panties bunch. I'm vaccinated live know Delta galveston. 😱 asked questions all? paid $8/hr? Seriously? That's insane, minimum wage half states. would anyone sign first place getting degree?  “You can’t go back, Bob.” software developer seriously considering switching jobs go remote. work initially allowed work home, 6 months, regressive HR manager went GM's head get CEO involved. idea lies told (she quite dishonest) managed get order forcing everyone back office, division only, CEO himself.

I worked 17 years, issue thinking leaving. certainly respond anything remote.

I productive, less stressed, much time sleep relaxation without commute, spent less gas. around, better *everyone*, forced go back tough pill swallow.

So yeah, totally understand experience. Especially developers. productivity tied closely morale, energy level, lack distractions, anything improves absolutely huge. blaming GOP Democrat-run CDC caught lying again? Companies adapt CDC hasn’t stopped collecting data breakthrough cases. stopped actively tracking tracking breakthrough cases lead hospitalization fatal. breakthrough cases still supposed reported CDC though. still data collected it. Unfortunate better surveillance US. anyone know number total ICU beds per unit population Texas? I've ecstatic back office times week since reopened June. nobody watching you, nice feeling come whenever want leave whenever. 

Granted, home going office forces finish work soon never let seep home life. lot people struggled separating boundaries home work life continue work longer hours. leave parking lot, checking e-mails thinking work next day. get trying say. especially US vaccines hit scene felt breakthroughs needed counted hospitalized. don’t data breakthrough infections overall. 

Anecdotaly hearing breakthroughs media, family, friends, associates seems yeah breakthroughs anticipated. 

Data starting show breakthroughs aren’t rare. bosses concerned getting people back office? metric pop density. Look case per 100,000 people. understand all, it’s infuriating. Fire people take advantage working home don’t work, let rest us happier, productive, work home employees. message got company is: consider privilege ever let work home could make office 5 days week wanted to. wish could work home :(

It's crazy many companies want people coming back office. home, waste money renting office?? Youd think would around win everyone, seems companies hellbent making employees suffer I'm fully vaccinated. since March. I'm tired. I've following guidelines mandates whole time. I've even tried safer guidelines time, protect nephew younger year.

Most days I'm entirely jaded whole situation. anti-vaxers starting get forced getting vaxed, there's new wave frustration coming me. work pharmacy, number times hear ""I want to, to,"" far anticipated, disheartening.

We could've side months ago, many people valued total lack personal inconvenience greater good world, we're still wearing masks, still getting worse news day, still dealing tons uncertainty. I'm done. can't anymore. us suffering, even draconian self-imposed lockdowns. know labeling victim; certainly feel way. throw around term ""PTSD"" casually.

What's ""disturbing"" it? think pointless circle-jerk worrying? let people affect ""disturb"" you? hard compare across countries, different population densities, different levels social support, economic situations. people hopeful, fully expect see steep rise cases turns around. shut inside negatively impacted lot people, imagine life without pandemic, work home. That's ideal least option compatible role. Workers stupid. I'm gonna predict Delta last major player/wave fight. Caveat: Kids/schools/vaccine approval 12s..... reality true death toll probably somewhere opposition party's figures much lower official numbers I'm you. Nothing good enough comparison. closest one I've able find that, data Europe Israel already showed breakthrough infections occurring, even vaccinated people needed wear masks time CDC made announcement    need go back office again? fight still legitimate reason. locked 10 year leases massive empty buildings, think that’s drives push That's kind worrying months ago, 99% new cases unvaccinated 78%. got early vaccinations higher proportion population vaxxed? ""Both Moderna Pfizer said 90 percent effective preventing symptomatic illness""

Damn, media outlets keep repeating high figures previous variants. Feel like lulls lot vulnerable people sense security. Entire generations Americans, Brazilians, Russians mentally challenged Went 2 car household needing 1 car must joy parties. Covid pun intended. grocery stores Lowes. Haha, feel way. Also management never flaunt job title e-mail signature; department function. kind irks people make 'Director' 'VP' title big bold letters. 

Some companies relatively flat structure Director immense stature whereas role may VP+ another. housing exclusive too, along someone move closer work comes new costs, certainly reflect additional wages. seems unpopular opinion here, like going office. started new job March company reopened office hybrid schedule (3 in, 2 out) April. first optional, mandatory starting July 1, it’s optional due delta variant. 

I go office everyday except Friday. Although it’s optional again, people still 3 days. I’ve found beneficial. I’ve able learn faster build better relationship teammates. 

I know majority seem hate office. understand apprehension, definitely pros people purposely ignoring.  dunno ICU cases rising. Lambda nothing burger right now. Delta fit/dominant anything gain advantage. variant demonstrates even contagiousness superior Delta remain dominant. slippery slope. First employees become happier. Next they'll realize life outside work. can't THAT.

There's good reason society outlaws drugs make feel *good* (marijuana) legalizes drugs make feel bad increase nervous Rebecca (alcohol, caffeine). reminder CDC full politicians, scientists

the lack collecting data deliberate actually would debate that. claimed amount people personally know would rather avoid 99% humans favor 1 2 good friends tells social told. Plus dog companion. 90%+ efficacy hospitlization.

it's almost evidence suggest working home efficient working office Effectiveness hospitalization way too. look month July, data Mayo Clinic covering Minnesota found Pfizer 75%/Moderna 81%, Wisconsin's data July shows 73% effectiveness fully vaccinated people, 90% death. people known contact, get tested even asymptomatic. help least. majority us home anyway, even I, hypothetically, asymptomatic infection, I'm passing anyone.

I provided exact number Kentucky residents infected SARS-CoV-2 2020, vaccination status reinfected May–June 2021 compared residents reinfected. case-control study, unvaccinated associated 2.34 times odds reinfection compared fully vaccinated.""

That's strong data going right Delta changing numbers. 

But seem ignoring give solid numbers. wait, big bailouts coming soon add sources later comments. I’ll assume didn’t read whole thread. again. mean like doctors nurses? Lol.  want go office full-time there's definitely aspects fully working home struggle with:

* whatever reason workplace hyper-connected. Managers comfortable booking meetings 6-7am 6-7pm little respect lunch hour like used to. complain nobody cares. ""Just wake earlier"" say, ""just stay extra two hours"", say. ""It's priority get done"" say, although really priority worth addressing core business hours? used limit meeting times 9:30am 3:30pm respect everyone's start end times that's window. 

* People know can't travel anywhere probably nearby vacation time. led consider toxic expectation always around unless explicitly tell people truly unavailable certain hours damn vacation. Two managers took vacations summer still came online meetings. guess maybe admirable eyes some, IMO nothing better do? Read book go cook meal kids. That's I'd doing. 

* talk hands lot. confined tiny Zoom meeting box filters arms feels stifling I'm meeting. 

* I'm fast unmute button people feels like never get word it. everyone cameras paying attention cameras really pick social cues someone speak. Using ""raise hand"" function nice theory respect it. 

* struggle stay focused Zoom meetings. I'm playing games checking e-mails. Even turn camera, full-screen monitor meeting block distractions, try best stay focused, completely zone hearing voices people various volumes quality blasted directly ear via headphones

* can't stand home office work. used love gaming want nothing it. whole room associated work want step foot work. like company owns part house. still consider lucky work bedroom though. 

Is crappy company people experiencing too? even know related working home definitely problems company moved fully WFH environment. strange hybrid setup mix full remote people people across multiple offices come every day.   Yes true. mean one common English surnames occupation surname isn’t really occupation anymore (Smith). Industrial es come go time. People always adapt, suck caught changeover. get much done

This definitely universally true... Interesting used ""right left"" rather ""left right"" usually used. say loud well? ...   Nah, know shocking amount doctors, nurses (RN's), etc., ""medical freedom"" ""vaccine resistant"". 

Goes show even secondary education can't fix stupid.  Go spread Covid wondering still anti-Covid-rules. Hint: you. think 50% jobs BS; think 50% given office job (time productive stuff) BS. perhaps Alpha increased antibody levels point Delta get foothold? apologies, Quebec only. provincial even mine. think BC considering due uptick delta cases. government ramping logistics third dose begin Sept. 20, people get eight months second dose. Details pending FDA authorization CDC recommendations, complete next weeks.  


Only thirds dose booster planned now. New virus, new disease, new vaccine— take observation time see durability response. may secondary immune response booster long-lasting, like polio hepatitis B vaccines two doses primary series booster months later. maybe boosters needed. We‘ll wait see. would suck entire generations people US developing countries least permanently weakened Covid. seriously need booster shots based delta. Old people really risk especially since vaccine early. Hopefully manufacturers provide.  Hope so. I've remote like 4 years now. Permanent remote jobs increase potential job market. still wear mask either way kids able get vaccinated. Fascinating, got covid prior delta incubation period likely longer could lead longer immunity line? rather force rest coworkers work situation like suit personal work culture? Trump.

Naturally, manager concerned I'm dedicated enough career. SMH.   Yeah, yes shit? Sure. Keep repeating myth. Doesn’t mean it’s true. difficult foreigners wrap heads around trying reach high vaccination rate letting covid get control. Unvaccinated particular rural region. thus isn’t official provincial modeling. It’s private group known extremely sensationalist data. one really takes forecasts seriously they’re consistently top. Look bulk buying options online. Anecdotally, I’ve using Binax test study, (as participant, researcher) seems perform well easy use. managers want come back office micromanage asses! got one manager tracking tallying fast questions get answered WebEx chat! may dependent antibody levels population. levels high major event, low akin setting dried Christmas tree fire. kids fine - kids lowest risk group is.

There problem that, per se. *is* problem think moral justification get third dose before, e.g., 80 year old Africa gets first dose.

That said, boosters going offered, reason get one--it though ship unused doses somewhere useful.

As final note, clear well third dose actually work prevent mild breakthroughs. purpose boosters give us massive number antibodies wild type certainly happen. antibodies eventually fade--they to, can't protein blood ever--and boost again, ideal world, we'd vaccinating variants instead, probably nasal vaccine.

Pfizer gang what’s goooooood! lot data fix cars people would still prefer leave professionals make sure screw something up. Also data long term (years) effects vaccine. I'm vaccinated gotta understand point view. Per Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) used collect reports adverse events vaccination general public. primarily used identify potential topics investigate regards vaccine reactions. However, event data VAERS often verified often self-reported, assumed adverse events VAERS actually associated cause vaccines, possible estimate frequency adverse events data.

On hand never vaccine side effect starts six weeks dosing. unknown long term side effects vaccines- vaccine long gone you’re left immune memory understood decades. billions doses given it’s one studied biologic therapies ever.

As others said - long-term risks Covid much worse side effects shot.   Given Moderna shown better efficacy Delta, I'd rather vaccine hesitant get Moderna Pfizer. two things US taxes, take standard deduction itemize deductions (ie take cash back home office stuff). standard deduction greater value itemized deductions technically get 'credit' office expenses, that's I'm getting greater credit. Ha. dumb statement.

We are. I'm ignorant, obstinate fuck endangering health community, hope get called it. I’m wondering people said “It *isn’t* FDA approved- getting it!”, say now? Don’t assume know politics I’m setting aside might agree me. I’m normally cool kind data collection required hardcore contact tracing like China does. think us cool facial recognition tech central database citizen location use make work. don’t think I’m controversial saying us understand benefit using system like emergency scenario honor system doesn’t cut it. probably wouldn’t even vote give government power allowed understand there’s level mortality risk supersede concerns personal privacy. Soon shall dubbed *“SpaceVax”*… 6 seasons vaccine!    Even then, circulate among vaccinated breakthrough cases, right?  com part get associating communism's. Yep, pretty much saw coming.  


What bugs children might feel knowing parent(s) would rather die kids wear masks. :( Tough, finding parents give damn die not. Totally same, can’t quit soon enough. Def telling people I’m spikevaxed beginning year someone come said, ""If everyone vaccinated, EVERYTHING, including economy, could go back normal."" case, I'm afraid going go least end 2022, longer.

Many us thought vaccine end year everything would go back normal, anything, bad worse vaccine came out. make good points, fairly limited perspectives. first focused car+office energy vs home, certainly valid critique (especially winter, point out), fails consider aspects mentioned. second makes odd leaps. people stop taking public transportation seldom trips office ? sure lead suspect that, I'll accept valid. they'll order delivery lunch every day (despite fridge feet away), companies keep 100% office space 10% employees use it, etc. Like, they're dubiously valid, limited applicability even then. One-offs. 

I say idea ""rebound"" effects definitely widespread problem. soon people could go went; en masse. Restaurants bars *packed*.  that's short term problem, hardly relates whether everyone forced go office everyday. think long term, without lockdowns, sort stuff work out. isn't.

sorry, is

Comments like beyond absurd. spring 2020 closed schools. many studies show school contribute community spread. used work ICU took care lot ECMO patients. One year, like 2013 somewhere around there, many influenza patients ran ECMO circuits. 20s 30s. like way way worse. CDC top things since 2020 You’re selfish idiot. one thought this.

Overhearing conversations know discussing something take time ultimately fail, office hear get intervene. setting impromptu meeting people would take days find right time zoom meeting. advantages, think come close outweighing positives working home roles. delta, vaccinated people still wear masks. 

It’s also important consider factors:

1.	Vaccinated people significantly less likely become infected first place, infected individuals spread virus others. 
2.	The viral load vaccinated people breakthrough infections decreases significantly faster unvaccinated individuals. 

Vaccinated people *much* less likely spread virus. child mortality rate consider acceptable level? might businesses aren’t leaving Texas Florida  I'll feel safe billion shots administered US. shut Moderna take money!

It’s simple really, focus easily isolated. It’s always way.

Edit: also work hours Aahh see. idea [here's article December pretty interesting read. imagine they'll mandate ""You must receive vaccine COVID"" specify which. people complain approved point Pfizer tell get one. worry employers? employer hire people go back work. others go back go broke ""1300 sounds high, 0.000026% sounds low. take latter feel bad.""

Why people think kind thinking comes insightful? it! time! tell high fructose corn syrup he/she'll waddle nearest CVS fast he/she Go. There's reason stay. Find remote position. happier may even paid better too. He's right, instance. always brought kind gotcha. always people can't get vaccines. mandate know ever draconian screwed over. course, popular idea last several months seems ""fully vaccinated,"" free walk among people whatever want without harm self others. can't get sick yourself, can't get people sick, either.

Now propositions seem collapsing. hand, means restaurants small businesses smaller towns better city office workers move there. That’s I’m doing. trip planned Orlando fall canceled switched Anaheim. know it’s perfect either, can’t worse Florida. Thanks doc. true, I'm US (should've mentioned), I'm concerned studies reflecting 3-week follow shot.

From document linked, studies countries 3-4 *months* shots (see page 17) yielded following efficacy symptomatic Delta infection:

88%
85%

Meanwhile, studies countries 3-4 *weeks* shots - like US - yielded following efficacy symptomatic Delta infection:

41%
54%

That's I'm dismayed reporting US papers informing us 80-90% protection symptomatic infection. feels like telling neighbors we're risk tropical storm found United Arab Emirates. The, ""I'm going grow tail"" people obviously fucking idiots. concern long term effects new medicine valid. 


In FDAs report literally say long term effects unknown would monitoring myocarditis pericarditis, ailments weaken heart severe enough. Yeah, valid angry selfish idiots lie make fairy tales get vaccine, act like 0 cause concern naive. 


Again, got fucking vaccine, understand situation black white. sick late December 2019 - early January 2020. nasty cough lingered weeks. went doctor twice time tested negative flu strep. Guess I'll never know sure. I'm glad vaccinated now.

Edit: Alabama. Yeah drug names pretty interesting. marketing name usually insane sounding shit, sometimes actual etymology times don’t. Meanwhile scientific names pretty specific structure. Antivirals end -vir instance, bunch mental health drugs end -pram (can’t remember means), parts drug name follow similar rules well. Here's bone-headed idea came with. Chevy Chase commercials it.

""Hi there! I'm Chevy Chas. may recognize shows movies like Community, National Lampoons Christmas Vacation. Community, lot humor, I'll admit, make lot sense. took time hit stride, really loved relationships resulted taking roll. know make sense right away? Getting vaccinated. take ... knuckleball like see makes sense. So, struggle like did. 'Cause intubated dying . . . laughing matter."" 
Title Card: Comirnaty Pfizer-BioNTech

Or

""PfizerBioNTech, helping get back community Comirnaty. Get vaccinated today.""  It’s actually quite clever. went least catchy name ever, nod making Covid “less catchy”. exactly reasoning wanting mRNA one? realize you’re thread fda approved right?  EU vaccines approved months ago. take long US? I'd say somewhere FLÄRDFULL HEMNES Ikea furniture tier list.  really understand people that? Cimmunity? read makes sense lol last family I'm touch got second shot last week, fact! He's 15 said thought vaccine risk covid risk. father letting make medical decision, watched wife (who boy's step-mother, get well actually) work overtime weeks end nurse Alabama monoclonal antibody infusion clinic decided enough enough, going get vaccinated. minor protest kid agreed pretty easily law laid he's double-vaxxed.  Yeah cool saying need enact totalitarian power CCP effectively eliminate covid maintain elimination. Great, sure would easy sell west. Yeah what's reasoning? Vaccine mandates lot better. can't convinced. suffering sunken cost fallacy regards egos much issue made this. can't back down.

Personally, assuming negative blow back conscientious crowd, I'm fine watching episode ""Fuck Around Find Out!"" unless Amish.

There countless things ""don't yet know long-term outcomes"" about. means cannot definitively say none.

There's also exactly zero reason suspect might negative long-term health outcomes. think first point probably important problem this. Even trusted “news” sources guilty intentionally misleading readers order stoke fear anger get clicks. It’s core problem almost issue facing society today tearing country apart. something doesn’t change soon completely destroy us. Two months data emergency use, 6 months full approval cool! Super hot!! partner looking tonight ;) nearby? wife got booster shot Friday due RA meds.

She talked doctor recommended getting well scheduled appointment brought card got well.

She said someone else category well good schedule appointment. lot folks using “not fully FDA approved” reason get vaccinated. Assuming they’re acting good faith, expect millions sign now, right? Moderna Gang officially change name Spike Gang. 

And thus, win entire war. praying hard enough? like mask blocking it. did, flu. Similar timeline person above. work *much, much, much* better nothing.

It's insane argue better give three doses healthy 30 year olds rather single dose vulnerable. Even though still caught case Rona, made even grateful getting vaccine.

I exposed work Monday Tuesday Typhoid Mary decided tell people husband tested positive. tested sure enough.....

My symptoms started Thursday night order..marked * since went away

Tickley throat*
Occasional hard cough
Congestion
Ears popping*
Fatigue*
Brain fog*
Loss smell taste


Saturday worse day.. even felt like bleh cold.. horrible, tired annoyed mostly.. I'm still able clean take care child.. though tricky getting sick, system think we've successful far.. 

I Moderna Vaccine, worth. support mandatory vaccinations, even means pinning people will? Take like animal lol I'm skeptical anything coming China TBH  dude pisses off, seeing like “He’s line, he’s right”. government mandating vaccines. private companies bound US constitution. mandate vaccine condition employment. like that? refuse find another job.

Edit: cover bases, I’ll take Camir-whatchamacallit booster. doubt get both. LOL. NJ choice Pfizer, Moderna J&amp;J. say remote workers cannot come office participate work-related travel unvaccinated, fire you. company vaccines, that, potentially firing many employees would pretty bad company.  No, case I'm board government need get us fuck pandemic I'm tired absolute dipshits ruining everything.  They've changed definition covid-zero now. Apparently ever meant last vaccination thresholds met. Honestly, prefer definition delusion rest world would eventually start pursuing policy. Contact tracing (relying apps) one part it. Mass testing another. Cities millions inhabitants re-tested every days cases subside. Whoa, SpikeVax flowing body? Neat!  

They publicize more, think people questionable decision making skills may find ""cool"" name makes getting shot worth it. knows? correct situation NZ different US, although commenter head sand hospitals filling US (they definitely are) ""I trust government says get experimental vaccine... I'm going wait FDA approval"" 
 
... FDA approves ... 
 
""Uh.... trust FDA, part government... yeah, that's it"". 
 
It'll interesting next excuse put responsible is.  fwiw side/aftereffects Covid bad, last long happen large percentage people get Covid vaccine side effects piddling comparison.

I mean feeling crappy short breath. mean blood clots seizures memory problems stuff. Covid absolutely wreck body long-ass time.

Moderna made tired days first shot arm felt like punched like 8-10 days. Learned later fault. told move arm around lot second shot help vaccine disperse injection site sure enough, hurt much less like 3 days. Easy peasy. definitely booster shot. that's worth. Comm ear knat why? That's read  People skeptical preferred J&amp;J vaccine told traditional type vaccine like others gotten past. Whereas Pfizer Moderna brand new technology apparently skipped necessary proper steps. 

Every person spoke aware long mRNA existed, commercially. even upon made aware, questioned wasn’t ever used then. Money, course, guess that’s beside point.

People also said never able make proper vaccine flu impossible. mRNA ones effective? never even tested animals! ( idea start answering one)

Last, think it’s good old fashion brand loyalty. We’ve seeing logo family oriented commercials decades. kind marketing powerful people realize. That’s hope well, would much easier way.  may true reinfection, though I'd like see solid data quantifying this, especially mild covid also cause long-term disability.

Regardless, risk first bout covid *individual year* still higher driving, since, assuming catch covid next 12 months, 1 100 chance disability according research now. far higher chance disability driving every day next 12 months.   specifically FDA approval - opposed Emergency approval. Great news! legal differences emergence use acts full approval? Could elaborate? wife recently published academic paper well received admittedly narrow, highly specialized field. subject matter, got surprising amount traction mainstream media.

She interview local TV news program. became clear, even anchor setting field reporter's segment, approached story pre-baked narrative would dislodged from. whole 4-minute segment basically focused peripheral issue completely missed quite important slightly difficult point research.

However, typical viewer specialized knowledge, would've seemed fine moderately interesting.

Her paper library archival classification systems metatdata. Quite important field well researchers, undergrad post-graduate students, eventually general public using library systems. **But important unprecedented public health crisis.**

The idea news outlets, local national, approach pretty much **every** story, including Covid public health policy, cavalier attitude (never mind propaganda ideologically-driven outlets do), frankly horrifying.

Science academic research way mandated ""give equal time sides story"". public broadcasters newspapers (at least ""reputable"" ones, Newsmax-ey ones) part beholden notion ""fairness"". He's Primary Care doctor, ER ICU specialist, clear. He's allowed take families clients.

Doctors refusing emergency care unvaxxed would get licenses yanked. cool genuine medical reason get vaccinated, fine, mandates exceptions that.

So really think making shit try generate narrative exist reality. Pretty incredible they’ve able fast. Congrats everyone Pfizer, BioNTech FDA hard work. expect insurance companies start raising costs unvaccinated well.

Not going happen. would go ACA people legitimately die disability cannot get it. One hope  Totally. sucks Japan USA need start 3rd shot campaign. Ay yi yi  mRNA tech initially used ""Bodybuliding, Baldness, Boners"", we'd totally different place vaccine hesitancy.  ""Too rushed."" much hear people saying "" I'll get vaccine approved FDA"" know vast majority semi-reasonable excuse latched onto would take vaccine still seeming somewhat rational among social group. guess find semi-rational excuse cover lie getting vaccine get vaccine. imagine goal posts trash bins actually. vaccine work lot vulnerable population. FWIW, many medical experts agree this. I’m sure point is. “the path possible reasonable life shackle multiple mortgages worth debt” silly, utterly ridiculous statement. guess *could* contain delta know citizens going still face financial ruin medical treatment even insurance though. lot people plans max allowed pocket $8000. (If one person plan, end $16,000 year max pocket.) Americans live paycheck paycheck kind savings. 

And insurance companies dropped ""your treatment free"" policies, people paying that. surviving spouse will. also funeral expenses average $5000 cremation. That's we're seeing many GoFundMe unvaccinated. Stop spreading disease then. stick quarter shoulder well. used common ""magic trick"" kids would do.

How way special her?  [The approval allows Pfizer market looking forward ""get free dose Viagra Comirnaty!"" ads. work Fortune 50 company see minus executive office pressure, pulling bigwigs big players sector WH putting pressure. happened, it'd probably end big players sector mandate. get see lame excuses ""but vaccine FDA approved, I'm getting it"" people going come with.  know particular milestone important them? Lol! Wishful thinking anticipate encourage teams create coverups potential worse spread among _unpaid athletes_ end result financial assistance rendered affected. Nobody held accountable course. Let's see.

Vaccine long term health outcome: unknown.

COVID-19 long term health outcome: Death permanent disability.

Yeah... Might well go unknown vaccine one death even effects unknown moment. Bad name, oh well :) 


Going interesting see employers grow pair start requiring vaccinations. 


Related - absolute, utter horseshit religious exemptions vaccinations.  fully expect see major uptick number new spiritual workers employers offer loophole.  religion really says can't vaccinated, also exempt getting treated hospitals--go find spiritual advisor pray away covid. Florida hospitals full covid patients actually…

You’re right though people USA need get vaccine, it’s easy reason problems failing personal choice. I’m going life normal USA I’m vaccinated.

This foreign country. Different people different risk tolerances hurting anyone let theirs. No. ignorant thinking. I’m surprised you’re comment doesn’t downvotes original commenter. vaccinated. risk serious illness low. I’m young, fit, healthy. risk infection also extremely low. free time spent immediate family vulnerable ones vaccinated. wear mask 9 hours day work. come home take care household family that. contributing spread COVID. 

I’m pretty sure risk transmission lower people vaccinated going I’m daily lives per usual. Nobody immediate circles gotten sick entire time. home work. 

Why would think selfish? anti-vaccine? support people getting it, especially going prone serious infection either age health conditions. 

This controversial. I've said regarding whole ""no one wants work anymore"" bullshit:

Some 600,000 1,000,000 people died. Somewhere 3,000,000 15,000,000, Americans living long covid; they're working, need help family friends meaning family friends helping instead picking hours. Childcare, eldercare, home healthcare expensive, easier cheaper someone stay home instead working.

People thrown jobs warning minimal cushion. They've year adjust. moved back home longer old jobs are. got new jobs compatible lives, secure moment's notice. went back school pick new skills.

A bunch older Americans health conditions flat-out retired.

Some percentage immigrants, legal undocumented, went home returned.

It's combination number factors, certainly ""no one's willing work"".

Also, generally find *someone* work, job *some* redeeming feature: easy commute, flexible hours, fun rewarding job, great coworkers fantastic boss, career passionate about, engaging customers, good pay, great benefits, decent healthcare, company car, tuition reimbursement, free food - **something**. still can't find people work you, says work environment anything else. vaccinated? Wear KN95/FFP2 mask times try keep distance. talking don’t talk straight people’s faces vice versa. Wash hands. Open windows regularly. much else besides going. exactly agenda? can't figure think know reality virus media health professionals gotten wrong. enlightened factsandlogic2018. people paid social security never receive payouts. fair goes survivors different cashed check themselves. really complaining can't take dead people money. Get spiked 

#**GET FUCKED** that's really plan stick 100% that's valid plan B. think sustainable. assumes vax mandate always seen negative thing prospective employee. book, plus.  I'll honest, I'm one people waiting get approved FDA. Going schedule get right now.  would think okay, mandate would say ""you vaccinated."" full approval gives brass now, necessarily say ONE go get. Microsoft sounds like doctor said ""it could false result, take precautions."" that's fair - false negatives definitely *can* happen, erring side caution novel disease sounds like good approach. happen twice, symptoms disappear 24 hours people symptomatic several days symptoms even vaccination, would seem pretty extreme outlier.

But again, trust word one, I'm dude internet. want professional advice consult professional.   US, maybe, places track breakthrough cases showing high incidence long COVID breakthrough cases. I'm sure people desperately want long COVID problematic vaccinated. forget tell bring light inside body. Maybe shaman explain that. come mandates! avoidable death chose put harms way of... can't feel bad someone purposefully harming despite warnings vaccine available.  


I feel bad they'll harm way out, though. Nice, thanks sharing this. funny based context appears author made example ""barbarous verb"" show fresh slang replaces old slang, are. We'll get one way another. We're back 1000 dying day. Pfizer's vaccine got full FDA approval. Mandates easier enforce work, school requirements. fall winter anything like last year, companies going allow unvaxxed workers. pandemic hurting bottom line. Ha! moved Friday. Look behind you. Still going strong!  wonder many people ever known brand name vaccine they've taken.    realize couple people tested vaccinated wedding nobody else would risk catching COVID, right? 

Lol... Grizzly RonaGreen Swisher Vaxsweets cover would call health extremism.  [And Iraan, Iraan far away assholes choose unvaccinated putting everyone else increased risk, especially legitimate reason vaccinated children 12 people immune disorders. Unvaccinated assholes also reason virus continues spread high rate, thus increasing odds mutations ability punch vaccination immunity arise.

Selfish, ignorant, reckless, stupid also good descriptions people chosen remain unvaccinated. Spiteful also fits many cases, though depends reason remaining unvaccinated, well adherence precautions. I'm really glad hear you! Hugs you! also name company makes precooked pasta: La Moderna.  People like what? Like me, providing boundaries, like VP, expecting unpaid work hours?  Thanks 0bama.   Oh. Ops. overlooked xD
Thank  ""farm"" buy animals from, slaughterhouse? Well yes probably wouldnt say  highly doubt people taking listen.  


It's choice enjoy personal freedoms much possible, right? /s shooting Nov. Dec. know, need sooner. get unreasonably angry stupid fucking drug marketing names. 

And stupid cover song commercial people *having fun!* 

And stupid wooshing logo trying signify fun activities suffering _______!

And side effects (I understand rare) sounding worse ailment time.

I think hate drug commercials TV. trial mine weird research name, BNT162 something like u.s. new leading export Covid mutations. Also, fraction population vaccinated, creates pressure-cooker evolutionary situation basically perfect environment virus evolve outside vaccine spectrum. Antivaxxers single greatest immediate threat human civilization right - yes, I'm including climate crisis calculation. conspiracy theories.... encouragement ends soon needle hits arms.

All I’m saying don’t deserve pat back *after* needle comes out. 

Any adult left home unvaccinated reason, whether work, school, simple trip grocery store, was/is part problem. “get vaccine put others risk dying” wasn’t enough encouragement, they’re assholes.

We tried nice attitude it. Didn’t work. point, mandates thing going get vast majority anti-vaxxers comply. possible Delta. possible without high vaccine rate. Generally mistrust government rapid ‘race vaccine’. mostly white Anglo-Saxon, Tuskagee Study/Experiments one reasons - others related effecting medications and/or birth control. mix left right leaning well.

Hi there. Check [our yet, mod still takes questions well :)  75 patients public hospitals across Sydney’s south western suburbs acquired COVID-19 receiving number infections acquired hospitalized high. need research hospitals super-spreaders. Even so, cost well hundred million infections (infections confirmed cases), tens millions debilitating possibly crippling illnesses, hundreds thousands deaths, decimated families communities, hobbled health care sector, many horrors, many remain seen. far. book, colossal sacrifice never made never made, many fellow Americans disagree. He'd claim something like ""Only democrats care FDA ignore attempts reason Still nothing little one (age 5)? probably thinking sounded like 'community' time! 

Don’t forget tested vaccine medicine. Approx. 3 billion doses ! us got triple spike vaxxed (immune compromised) last week!  First? Im confused. odd people feign concern quality vaccine various conspiracies what's included (microchips). sudden can't go Cabo get it. 

Like actually concerned shit would absolutely travel avoid getting something think dangerous. avoid long? advertise ok Facebook stupid are?

I think 1 thing. 100% attention seeking right? people sort deep seeded need seen relevant others. Despite fact people irrelevant people. wasn’t possible AFAIK, Reddit using algorithm spoon feed hate clickbait. consider enhanced forum \*social media\*  feel like folks proven longer believe science taught recieved degrees licenses, lose ability work healthcare. Fuck assholes.

I work college teach health sciences. One nursing instructors took meeting part talk nursing students ""can find evidence masking actually helps fact found evidence harms us"". a*nursing teacher* encouraging kind dangerous thinking among students. Wtf. gather article (my Study finds 6 months COVID still lung scarring.

They also go factors help predict bad. using language familiar hope someone else provides better summary detail.  never ever Pfizer, helps. think assume everyone knew first one reviewed, would first one approved. ""Let get straight, want inject *nuclear acid*?""

(Actually little surprised seen anti-vaxxers shouting injecting acid before. Maybe best give ideas.) 🤣😂💀 comes vaccinating public pandemic that's already killed millions worldwide trying prevent even hospitalizations death? Yes, absolutely. virus extremely contagious spreads, mutates, current mutations hitting younger healthier people much harder original strain.

Too many people want temporarily wear piece cloth faces, protect good others, we're at. objectively stupid opinion thinks recall vaccine. He's way far gone reasoned something use reason get into. Yea comrade new strains breaking US. No, makes easier requiring vaccines one approved! thought (as warm may be) people could wear appropriate covid masks bandannas something stay safe still least looking right fair! measures China used things like mass testing, extremely good contact tracing, limited lockdowns specific neighborhoods cities large numbers cases. think measures inherently ""totalitarian,"" broad support along common people China.

Honestly, epidemic control measures one biggest selling points Communist Party right now. they're imposed unwilling population. party popular *because of* measures. \*mostly\* new thing. technology around little nothing using en masse. looking someone similar experience maybe. ask think that, doctor did?  mean, think Snowden deserves pardon. know enough specifics two, reading Snowden's book made want take another look official stories.

All said, whataboutism shitty practices government make China *less* shitty. idea Chinese citizens love obey government choice laughable.  disagree bulk said, however absolutely believe harm good come from, continue come from, focus nuances. people understand nuances still make correct choice vaccinated already done so. people remain unvaccinated despite able receive jabs incapable making right choice, demonstrated unvaccinated status. heard ""It would BEHOOVE GET GOT DANG SHOT"", I'm ~~filthy casual~~ Reservist. Everyone that's paying attention knew mandate coming, matter SecDef waiting full approval starting earlier. really missed opportunity crowdsourcing vote name like Mountain Dew did. It’s identity politics again. Team red team blue. Team vaccine team anti vax. God forbid acknowledge nuances decision, actually conversation around it.  Hey get least try pivoting skepticism something else.

""You're almost asking right question. bloated government bureaucracy get vaccine approved efficiently economy health nation line, *why take long approving medical treatments MSM focusing on*? hiding safe medicine? Could postponing approval cancer cures 'part plan'? demand transparency FDA force hand blocking American ingenuity.

Anyway, Trump trusts vaccine must know behind scenes *current* one good go.""  Thank goodness. took way long. people sitting fence reason jump off. Like magnetic? so, know quarters non-ferrous right?  sounds like someone trying say ""community"" broken jaw that's wired shut. I’m actually looking go today got day off:) use work company subsidized Pfizer. worked chemical(non pharmaceutical) side knew I’d feel safe got fda approval. hoping would’ve faster. someone explain ""first"" one? thought already vaccines like Moderna Pfizer.  Internet gonna lit today! 😅 also tell death makes people's fertility rate go 0% lmao company pretty much same. super encouraging vaccination repeatedly telling managers let people take time needed vaccination supposed impact vacation time.  costs 100 tokens (purchasable store) long time since read recall racist. parts old woman? obvious medical contraindication put individual risk complications, would physician's perogative protect patient.

Now individuals small minority, issue.  Covid believed much covid her. I'm getting ""well yeah approved I'm waiting least year"" response lot now. best respond this? first COVID dose administered outside trials December 14, 2020 Phase III trials happening July. Arguably year since ""final"" version Pfizer vaccine given. looking 5-11 year olds getting approval end Sept. according WaPo article reading earlier.

Even advantages posed NZ's geography, they're *still* dealing COVID outbreaks, surprised combination Delta slow vaccine rollout causes abandon COVID zero strategy. Australia already seems changing course point, one others trying total elimination.

Again, trying go you, specifically, this, I've seen *so* many people try play Monday morning quarterback without fully considering absolutely *massive* scale this.

Man, people suck. GTFOH, 'both sides' bullshit.  


One side paying attention facts, reality, proven science medical knowledge, working hard saving many lives possible.  


The side ignoring facts, reality, proven science medical knowledge, working hard getting many people infected, harmed, killed COVID possible.

I know hard Melbourne locked down,it may enough hill want die on, it.  FYI.

This vaccines FDA approved. HORSE DEWORMER. VITAMINS EITHER. Meanwhile, Fox News started saying approval came fast, know done properly?

That network really evil. anti-covvaxx friend moved goalpost argument. April, said dangerous even approved fda. 

Why would put something body that's approved. sent he's saying trust fda anymore. take 4 years approve vaccine.

I even know discuss topic anymore. add 5 percent, that's 15 million people. means 150k less people die. use conservative rate death. Hell say 0.1% that's 15k. 25% icu beds US. even factoring long-hauler. Tozin Tozarian? Ask doctor Covfefe right you.   vaxx named Comirnaty

The argument also ignores fact evidence points new variants Covid significantly transmissible, point existing immunity may able significantly slow spread. fact, it’s suggestion children “much less affected” becoming less less true day. Either way, “much less” relative statement given terribly adult population impacted, isn’t comforting me.

Lol     Thats figured wanted make sure. know new mandates would effect vaccines.

Also hello fellow Baltimoron! like that, tons workers hospital going vanish they’ve refusing get vaccine, it’ll mandatory coming weeks. Oh well. Don’t work medical field refuse believe science. yesterday evening tested COVID-19 using home spit AG test sore throat. came back positive. followed another one came back negative - figured one false negative. 3 days prior also tested negative test, thought starting experience symptoms.

Today, morning, took PCR test which, surprisingly, came back negative.

Now wondering think this.

There chance AG test result false positive, right? Especially used layman. likely chance next getting 2 false negatives AG test 1 PCR test?

Am good? Oh god supposed like community flair?! definitely pay children lose parent covid. get small social security payments. Yep. argument shifted ""it's FDA tested can't take dangerous"", ""the FDA can't trusted x"" literally within days Pfizer tested FDA months ago. don’t get point. That’s also true. might technically “infected.” might mild symptoms. might “bad cold.” Nobody saying either asymptomatic hospital. There’s massive broad range potential things happen two outcomes, function vaccine working minimize illness. Would even better cases asymptotic? sure. I’ll take vast majority f vaccinated people staying hospital put success column. Moderna let us know plans fuckin booster? Half dose (50ug) Shot #3? full dose (100ug) Shot #3? 

Anxiously waiting I'm 6 months last shot home office, whole company Walmart? Much better x1000! Covfefesque go. Antivaxxers zero excuse now. Got get shot!  bet none people spread virus taking plane different continent 2020 essential people getting food electricity. Plus, still kind new virus. know long-term consequences. *should* trying avoid infection.

That necessarily mean boosters - masking distancing go long way - I'll take booster turn, sure.  See would go name tozin. That’s pretty glonky feel mad

That want roar

And count four hear antivax nuts changing goalposts already. want run lights shows without fearing life lives others, even though I'm fully vaccinated.

Make mandates happen. turns out, held hostage anti vaxxers. going it? 31% unvaccinated ""said would get vaccine approved"", according news morning.    children less deadly flu. That's know shit bad. rare HR quit along employees.  Oh yep. would fully enclosed area. 😂 *uglier buddy forced back 3 weeks ago. took 4 days someone called say tested positive 40 people closely interacted need monitor symptoms.  Everyone mandatory back working home. Well individual bands making decision tour.  work school district quarter kids asthma. People want pile woodchipper. assumes mutations increase virulence also shorten incubation period. still see leads bailouts. Stores close, people move shopping online banks manage fine Eventually? Yes.

Specifically severe pain completely preventable disease would eradicated worst controlled people simply done right thing time empathy other? Also yes. need test life preservers make sure work right apparently. gaurantee place work mandate (to point terminated). company close 100,000 employees US abroad. feel misleading. hospitals may able talk specific patients covid status. However , talk public health information. many patients varying levels treated, without using names course. district one. think part time gig. kid sick parents come get hurt ambulance comes. Same. always worked home last 20 years..now want people stay home get enjoy office space myself.  allowed?   ""many people wouldn’t really care get go get shots""

This part I'm disagreeing on. I'm saying case. LOVE working home! Yeah seems lame. prone failure people skirt become complacent. Part communicating someone easily ability see facial expressions too. Video home least allows take mask see someone's face smile warmth they're speaking. masks sound muffled hard put full expression eyes time convey meaning. careful wish for.

This updated news story (retweeted Fla Health Dept) gives details trust numbers initial problem 3 day average wrong due human error. article: “Gov. Ron DeSantis said Monday suspected that, since CDC report Sundays Florida sent three days worth data, federal agency combined numbers.”

2. data directionally correct. article: “On Tuesday, Florida Hospital Association reported 14,787 confirmed COVID-19 hospitalizations Florida, 145% previous peak, July 2020”
Given trending numbers, it’s surprise eventually hit peak weekly deaths. Rather exact number, it’s looking trend indicator whether better worse I’m literally one meetings driving. Protecting team stuff. It’s overhead don’t need deal with.

It's like Natty Light two women primarily responsible naming drugs. It’s interesting! ""But even restrictions poorly enforced better blocking mask mandates required vaccines."" 


I think enough time interest, could challenge seemingly unarguable logic put forth (though lot goes limits length breadth cultural ask, I'll shortly get to). don't, let answer question, even though I'm sure matters, since think ever asserted Indo went going rapidly la UK India. argument pattern repeat Florida Texas suck? think so. OK, then. 


If Indonesia enacted zero restrictions, would happened? humble enough say idea, strongly suspect people would died, would even faster been. Everything seeing suggests Delta burns hot inexorably...but runs targets. worth, think local people would taken greater hit meant could get back lives faster, becoming desperate hopeless things ever get back normal pre-pandemic level tolerable impoverishment. 


That's nettle none us virtuous folk ever grasped, see. longer flatten curve, longer goes on, past certain point lost cultural buy starting see non-trivial quite literally fatal outcomes length time imposed restrictions (and we'll see geopolitical fall years COVID becomes endemic). would nice people endless patience resources things, many don't, many simply \*can't\*, think would better health messaging expectations calibrated realities.

For people get huge deal, wonder statements would help clarify situation. people deeply invested commercial real estate, vested interest people coming back office work. actually kind entertaining watching weird dance they're doing, trying justify people work remote, need come back all.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*    surprising. approved 12-15ba months ago, going similar lag get full approval.

It suck schools though. excuse anti-vaxxers

They whole encyclopedia excuses ""m"" mRNA stands messenger. Maybe Moderna uses ""modified"" sort branding, scientific term ""messenger RNA"". called ferries information DNA nucleus cell ribozomes convert information functional protein.

DNA RNA = transcription (like copying recipe book scrap paper)

RNA protein = translation (like actually using scrap paper bake cake).

If somehow get synthetic mRNA cell, cells cannot differentiate regular mRNA, slavishly follow recipe, making (in case) COVID spike protein. got full unrushed approval. Oh agree, i’m performing academic-grade study vaccines general public. I’m using experiences research determine think best myself, it’s really comfort thing.

At moment time, i’m comfort taking vaccine personal experiences (ie: friend, sisters boyfriend). 

But, like today, Pfzier got FDA approval, makes comfortable taking vaccine. Source: i’m considering Pfzier J&amp;J. basically systems place stuff like this. society/humanity choice move ahead, left dust. direct penalty, everything else (banks, healthcare, schools...). *This Free Market always shout rooftops about.* Yup, mean significant number people get keep jobs. that’s good thing EXXXXTREEEMEEE!!!!  Yeah 'my' company also record earnings, must teams together special case (so isolate 1 2 quiet nice persons). Still productive office :-p going anti-vaxxers go to. I've seen lot responses ""the vaccine even FDA approved"". Hrm... Electric cars help thi ""Eric, little prick."" husband big research paper college it, sounds like best option little downside hybrid system office jobs.

There downsides WFH downsides office, mitigate hybrid schedule, downsides either pretty negligible. source difference is? I’d love ready next time hear nurse “healthcare workers” doing. It’s metaphor changing bounds debate. keep moving goal, it’s impossible opponent score. It’s one logical fallacies. 

Basically someone makes claim refute technicality detail never mentioned within scope debate before. keep forever protect position. numbers rising delta. want hold outs keep holding everyone else back. I'm eagerly waiting news either delta booster, universal booster 

recent research showed people got SARS 2003 got vaxed covid immune current strains theorized possible, universal booster question. mRNA tech sure, specific setup. mRNA sequences. Touché. also good end game. company mandate states ""only FDA approved vaccines"" similar, could large number people SOL since got Moderna J&amp;J (I fully expect vaccines get FDA approval also, know when).

I hope companies smart use language allows 3 vaccines. really care excuses idiots use anymore. care rapidly shrinking legal cover entertain excuses, big step forward respect. could get Spike Lee paid endorser use ""She's Gotta It"" slogan. I've worked fortune 500 companies. working remotely causes know people working on, entirely different issue remote vs office. need butts seats know people producing. ways gather productivity metrics. bunch dumb rules naming drugs prevent sounding drug. side effects third dose?  Considering knew SARS Chinese scientists already sequenced virus SARS, yes. would known big deal. Also, hospitals beginning fill China 2019 already. communicated this, could least anticipated it. Instead, hit Northern Italy like bomb rest Europe hope spread much (but had)... China communicated symptoms first cases mystery cases doctors mistook flu kind pneumonia... like third headline contain information, vaccine approved. God-damn sites really desperate drive traffic ad revenue. lift?

Elevator! large global corporation work can't afford lose employees. Unfortunately mandating vaccine :( Means companies feel comfortable mandate it. Antivaxers find new excuse since many saying won’t take it’s experimental vaccine/not FDA approved. 

Also means doctors prescribe off-label, might mean lots people getting off-label boosters boosters approved. I’m sure would also allow off-label prescriptions kids too. I’m actually quite curious thats case mean emergency approval 12  people get feed store, they’ll go buy self-administer. could already mandate before, companies there's really legal precedent mandating emergency use authorized vaccine, companies willing pay legal cost establish one.

There's plenty legal precedent requiring fully approved vaccines though, hesitancy subside now. honest hyperbolic idealistic, since eager engage, would say this: governments world theory could come plan people paid stay home, richer countries help pay poorer countries, etc. 90% people could quarantined, emergency essential services could still run heavy precautions etc. Things would like New Zealand, covid still concern it’s million times better what’s happening USA elsewhere Good. People take hard stances like this. pussyfooting around. Germany call BioNtech instead joke? know talking country fairly routinely imprisons people criticizing government Oof hurts. Went perfectly long rest rhe world get grips return NZ. 
My condolences. Haha, get it, funny trivializes torturing killing sentient animals Honestly, people like makes blood boil. point deaths hospitalizations seeing states like Texas Florida mostly preventable vaccine us freely readily available country. fact thousands deaths, patients makeshift COVID wards children medically airlifted state ICU full sizable portion state refuses vaccinate take even basic precautions like wearing mask tragedy fully preventable fact amplify called “leaders” criminal. Pfizer got full approval people hopeful overcome vaccine hesitancy not, you’re someone refuses vaccinate point worse someone anti-vax anti-mask op described; that’s putting lightly. you’re fighting mask policies schools, special place double hockey sticks you. know. One parent’s company already policy weeks ago someone already tendered resignation Germany people call Biontech. Also name often switched around news stuff call Biontech/Pfizer don’t even understand religious exemptions exist Catholic Church, Mormon church, Greek Orthodox, etc said support covid vaccine. headline got excited, seeing Jerusalem Post source instantly deflated excitement though. FOH government? decisions? Science filled uncertainty. That's experiments conducted rigorous observations made. world filled things know, observations subtle phenomena often show conflicting results.  antivaxers get vaccinated officially approved, right? ...right? ""nO! Im InForMeD ArE! GiVe H E H R E E W R N G P L L S"" definitely something need news on. much cooler say got SpikeVax, nooo, got *checks notes* Comirnaty? heard, Chinese grateful government.

As though they're allowed choice? Read happens people openly criticize government China. great news! schools, government institutions businesses require it. Hopefully moves needle Makes sense. It’s still weird thinking something comparable like going getting auto insurance company, telling you’re never going wear seat belt, forcing cover still accident didn’t wear seat belt. Obviously simple still makes system seem extremely flawed although feel like us already knew add, vertical scale graph read negative log. I.e. log N proportional -Ct (where N initial concentration.)

So drop raw quantity much steeper graph shows. *Beep Beep* ""Please consume 8-month confirmation can."" Seriously, could made uncomfortable say smh want people die hate life don’t feel like opinions wrong, want acknowledgment mask *are* forever symbolize going back, told it’s definitely temporary shouldn’t complain.  Guess they're going full medieval. Good luck God speed attendees! Yeah covid death trap. Fuck that. Everybody dies eventually sooner make peace inevitable, better quality life be. Google Delta basically driven earlier variants extinction.  soft? far worse that. Repeating comment make clever friend. Yeah recent jobs applied ridiculously time consuming. week, tell I'm working remote I'm leaving. may leave, (and sincerely trying brag here) they're losing one top 5 sales people entire company. Coworker mine, also top 5, expressed idea. bring ton business far smartest idea paper let us wish.

But sneaking feeling allow this, let us leave, see noticeable decline sales numbers. reason? little guy would WIN. corporate America? sir. able stand it. They'd feel personal attack.

Whatever. called us back June 2020. Yes, 2020, pandemic, vaccine available. clear point upper management viewed us. Cogs machine, make money. Nothing more. Nothing less.

I even job lined yet, can't deal shit anymore. plenty saved (could easily live 4-5 years pretty tight budget), find job allows remote work. disgusting trains, looking shoulder, taking 2 hours day office amount work already doing. I'm finished.

Sorry long rant, absolutely right. We're losing people left right, honestly hope crash burn unless treat employees way deserve. father Covid right area. I’m terrified. Hopefully getting third dose 8 months bumps numbers back up. Why, ""obviously vaccinated"" official positive infection before?
A study running mid May found majority symptomatic infections came unvaccinated/previously uninfected people, small fraction came people vaccinated without previous infection. previous infection, whether vaccinated not, develop disease. somebody explain me? I’m teacher school aged kids. Remote hardest thing I’ve ever done work. 

I wouldn’t trade family anything - def little envious childless work home friends right now. 

Hopefully kiddos able stay safe vaccine comes them. 

Also…if you’re already vocal school committee admins would encourage thorn whoever’s side need be. loudest people school committee meetings anti mask/vax folks I’m sick getting air time. 

Good luck year swine flu? earlier? People downvoting you, /u/ponythepom right. Im going back bitches 😎 We've back since June. Fucking hate life Please. articles. 2024 though? next year? isolate 2024 catch supposed weakest version COVID19? I'll keep eating slight increase utility costs 

Make sure find kind expenses written home office purposes. Lol yup! supposed go back September they’ve pushed next year January. 

We’re still planning huge live person conference 🙄  it’s simple. surge extreme even without kids. We’d still conversation mask mask even kids eligible months ago. How's loaded? trade literally children's deaths vs. setbacks learning. So, threshold acceptable you?

Also using ""whataboutism"" wrong. ironic refuse doctor's advice get vaccine, catch covid, suddenly trust doctor's advice treatment want bed hospital. There's baffling disconnect medical staff stressed seeing many preventable deaths piling up. It’s joke. meme maker, one (well, many people) believes fall gonna canceled. It’s trend 2024. GOOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Oh yeah I've read *The Stand* exactly   Agreed. seems strange. want bring numbers something? fast track approved permanent part time home (2 days week) VP never met assistants said no.

Right says state enters state medical emergency delta variant mandatory report office date gets pushed back Labor day Oct.

I infant home ain't complaining. live Canada knew. love Texas read lot want visit. executives company keep shouting 'collaboration' discussions this. office would see many eyes rolling. cannot ever tell supposed better. fling word around like buzz word. need get together, workshop, training employee get together, instead forcing us back stupid office every day. benefit vaccination + natural immunity. realize large part world's population able get vaccinated yet actions affect lives? giving fuck anyone going end well That’s anecdote. Wait. Im confused. Couldnt also come someone vaccinated? CDC said still spread. Hope ok!!! Lmao true. BC details tomorrow.  


Sounding like opt-in program though businesses “Because young doesn’t guarantee you’ll fine, Delta putting young people hospital point pandemic. vaccinated dramatically reduce you’re chance hospitalized dying. contagious Delta is- everyone get infected point.

I wanna see coworkers pretend listen stories weekend coffee machine, pro haha. work professor epidemiology give us presentation covid lot vaccine hesitancy. seemed concerned seen locally far % children get admitted hospital test positive. still low, seem bigger threat initial strain. That’s volume, morbidity.  would 100% agree much didn’t school aged kids traditionally conservative area board education hell bent getting people “back normal,” science damned. young vaccinated.

My wife introverted luxury working home. weren’t children, past year would’ve awesome.

Alas… past year instead stressed I’ve ever been. control goups real world data? Likely impossible globally, many developing countries never get 90% vaccination. even Delta, appears 90% threshold would confer herd immunity, infections vaccinations places first world get kicking screaming.

There new variants escape vaccines, neverending game booster shots - we're lucky, might back relative normal US Europe 2023. Possibly much sooner rough fall. Sorry, wish knew actual timeline was… know time infection symptoms cases less half Delta vs prior variants. 
It spreads works much quicker predecessors.  seems pretty easy direct show past history vaccinations person's part, thus showing religious claim void. heard that. Even approved, theres plenty idiotic parents save children. Awful. ""What's that? sent email vacation? Oh man, that's rough - reception whole time. curiosity next time, assuming give corporate sat-phone take company computer travel with, bill hours? assume day required work count vacation days PTO, right?""

That VP needs chill learn boundaries. bet tries interrupt lunch hours questions make photocopier work, too.

One dose lost validation IMO. know quite Vaggins went back thirds already reported first shot. Keep eye fully vaccinated. WFH options boosted productivity workplace. you? I'm small town I've known people put comas, people died, course people got it. 50% infection all. 80% flu like symptoms. 90% hospitalizations.

It's okay relax turn news bit. Check CDC regularly instead. Go outside vaccinated. husband tail end breakthrough infection, vaccinated March/April, anti TNF medicine, would qualified booster gotten suck week opened boosters people. day two feeling like crap lingering cough, shortness breath fatigue. said way often. numbers stated really large difficult conceptualize.

Bosses want people back office without real reason apart “going back normal” fired. reducing pay $1/hr remote workers

Yikes! would easier send email said ""Our competitors hiring"".  someone lives suburbs, could stand see places die forever. 

As someone lives suburbs, want see restaurant choices die.  Every philosophical tradition know lot say subject death imbue meaning.

Every intelligent person fears death. people even manage come terms it, usually help philosophy religion. recommend going route seeing find philosophy speaks you. Prove it. That's insane  Hospitals set limit unvaccinated. 

Like 20% hospital ICU beds reserved unvaccinated, goes over, they'll turned away.

The goal always prevent overwhelming healthcare system. let's set limits worry refuse vaccinate. 

Let get covid possibly get medical care fall seriously ill. Jan 2020 Alabama makes since given lot early Mississippi spread attributed Mardi Gras. Get flip flops, summer shorts. sunblock, funny always wanted visit Canada, always hear good things That’s exceptionally grim outlook situation. basically means there’s end sight. Unless I’m missing something. suppose that’s title thing “most dangerous phase pandemic?” mean... good. many jobs could easily done home without direct oversight. Companies legit embracing save renting space. Eh. think much depends industry, even job. already tried software development, un-tried disaster. Dev remote-friendly decade still great push replace us people overseas. really work, various reasons.

I go far say every job safe outsourcing, far it. even ship kind sailed. **can** replaced someone overseas, asking WFH going accelerate delay process. excuses everyone says run patience lockdowns. ""irrational"" tolerance lockdowns get-go, ""rational"" starting get tired well. Nothing like calling someone “triggered” start rational debate… Lancaster County PA here: masks sight Yeah, hear return work one time I’m going scream. I’ve working ass whole time, even hybrid. Thank encouragement also, hope you’re okay. chemo, hope means things better now. Lol nope. corporations equally dumb and/or evil. couple months decline even meet FDA 50% efficacy requirement Covid vaccines. Bye bye Pfizer Moderna. VP said, bosses gave leadership issues. went ""Slows"" ""Stops"". Pick one.  SOOO obvious 4 day work weeks working home better economy. leisure time means time money spent shopping, restaurants, activities, hobbies, etc.. better health population large would save billions. Less air pollution increases life expectancy, etc. It’s really problem unless start seeing hospitalizations deaths increase. I’m beginning see breakthrough cases good thing extremely old immune system serious health problems, like cancer. everyone else, breakthrough infection probably better long run natural immunity + vaccination provides best overall protection delta future variants. Yes. Basically, round numbers, population US little bit 300,000,000 600,000 deaths works 1 500 dead. nice even partial WFH. worked veterinary blood bank got permission medical records callbacks home. nice go patients meant one less person hospital taking space computer work. here. company wide call day said, ""we're starting initiative see employees want""
We want money, heard, treated fairly. hour commute equals extra week work per month: two hours per day (one hour way), five days week (10 hrs per week), 4 weeks per month (40+ hours). think way, removing hour commute huge. I’m sorry assumed aggressive! seem nice. know things are

Take care well :) people still want get vaccine, fine.

But also reserve 20% ICU hospital beds unvaccinated suffering covid. dying, that's bad, they'll turned away. 

The 80% reserved people illnesses need it, vaccinated suffering covid. people couldn’t work home job fought bringing people back soon, felt safer without unnecessary people there.  Better college. ok last year year ""return normal"" masks, proof vaccination, nothing. office aiming mid August hybrid schedule. got moved Q3/Q4 last month. Now, saying maybe Q1. 

I admit almost looking forward going back offfice social aspect. I’ve gone back two three times don’t like it. think bosses afraid. owners, people high they're completely disconnected reality work actually gets done, think term ""bosses"". Cue explosion Social Security Disability claims.

You thought tough get benefits pandemic... hate hate commuting holy shit waste life. job done remotely be. go back work office reason I’m getting new job crazy fuck shot them? see company claims pro-environment support return office business functioning normally past year. honestly think part kind embarrassment put tons money expensive downtown headquarters turned completely unnecessary (as well wasting incredible amount commute time workers). Immunity works exactly way. body's response change. difference variant there'll slightly different antigens, although many remain same. source claim Delta considerable immune escape, seen conclusive proof higher pathogenicity, although accepted transmissible? Yeah correcting you! Thought might want actual answer lol.

Take care, good day :) Nothing goes well giant turkey leg good ole case Delta Variant work ren faire circuit, people living tough spot. us take Covid seriously, they’re opening faire there. Or, know, we’ll starve. Half vendors rely ren faires already gone business. it’s worse crew members (people work directly faire). Many crew members actually rely faires place live year. rely two big faires California income, I’ve missed three row. miss next one, I’m done. Luckily next one I’m working requiring proof vaccination vendors crew. aware vaccines developed height global pandemic? 

Vaccine trial times inversely proportional amount community spread. community incidents, incidents trial. trial whenever incident limit hit everyone unblinded point. already proved efficacy statistically significant degree point, there's reason keep placebo group unprotected. actually started buying makeup working home way look Zoom! also exploring makeup time it. worked person around people never wore make thought looked dramatic dressed played gender roles way like. Definitely one thing executives last job seem grasp. everyone space dedicated workspace, people's reactions work home, IME, directly related home office works noise, roommates, clutter, space (and lack thereof) think need come back? personally worked residence short time Covid-19 pandemic still such. job sort computer support informative position nice.

I admit prefer work outside I'm active person upbringing. part wants work outside part wishes remain residence.

It's hard choice. 71% Americans 12 least one dose. 

The NYT page linked breaks age group 12 up, FYI. God that’s annoying. Instead saying “it rushed,” they’re asking “was rushed?” way get viewers think must rushed without actually making claims could get trouble.  vaccines prevent getting disease. still get spread covid covid vaccine...

But doesn’t change point everyone said would never mandates. couple months later people welcome mandates open arms. Yep. Nothing wrong J&amp;J looks like OP waiting longest possible thing happen even needed fda approval? Millions people already got it. don’t care. earned right use socialist aspects US health medical systems.

Two little shots took prevent overrun hospital system. don’t think you’ve got quite right unfortunately

You're gonna need cite yourself, Health Care workers much higher risk: Tons lives people making decision get vaccine. vaccine already prevents death right?

This biggest thing me. work home, feel need available time wake time go bed. There's something nice commute home put work mind. 8 months Israel 5 months?   health insurance companies starting take vaccination status account yet insurance rates?  Wales 22nd, interesting see different countries governments got right learn other.    need doctors for? go YouTube right? Unfortunately, according one Mayo Clinic's vaccine experts (Dr Poland), Delta seems much shorter incubation time. short, unlikely give long-term immunity. Infection Delta may even able give herd immunity Delta, much less variants produced infections. See Mayo Clinic Grand Rounds thread subreddit.  businesses, etc start mandating vaccines, stop wearing mask? point mandating vaccines places follow precautions vaccination?  Take antibody test maybe?  100% agreed. Individual freedoms stop impact people’s lives especially true becomes deadly. Mine got weird right after. thought first beginnings onset menopause, seems straightened past month so. also noticed seemed bruise easily little while.

IDK related, even is, small price pay. Sammy playing co-op Jesus Xbox live before, he’s crashing Jesus’ house, Jesus giving shit kicked earth dummy. This. see work place mandates see working liberal areas people going dig heels in. Huh…I wonder vaccine others got? Make lives wildly inconvenient possible.  situation going 9 months need doctor.

FWIW, OBs deal Covid patients maternity ward completely separate. medical professionals, OBs ones mostly likely going able easily safely find. Working numbers, uniform distribution cases would half vaccinated, half not, observed distribution 1/12 vaccinated, vaccine apparently reduces cases factor 6 (8% probability vs 50% probability).

In book, correct term ""significant"", ""vast minority"".  flu, many viruses, cause long-term problems argument hold water.

Ha, ha. posted [It's also common virus infections cause permanent consequences, hepatitis, west Nile disease come couple threads -- completely agree.

However, antivaxer logic self-contradictory hard write sentence can't logically criticized pro-science perspective. see this. can't get anything done home. permanent work home I'd fired within week. 1% population getting vaccinated every day. late start due lower priority country.   would gone American ameran.  course, depends heavily individual nature work. people obviously need access specific equipment facilities. Others home environment compatible work. 

In case, discussion mostly ""symbolic"" workers everything necessary internet connection and/or phone line.  Yeah. agree that. would great people wear masks sick permanent thing. thought trying say lock hard flu Covid. 

I feel like drastic measures necessary anymore. Thankfully I’m essential worker never work home brief period - let tell mental health shot shit it. don’t know people actually like it. couldn’t focus work, home space became sort weird blend work space home space. something go every day. horrible, hated it.

The FDA good job Yes it’s one. got it, “emergency use authorization.” means allowed used, full approval FDA yet. Full approval takes longer bc need collect review additional data. So, today FDA gave full approval Pfizer vaccine, Pfizer vaccine they’ve giving since December.    FDA exist Europe.... would make great national plan.

I thought Delta originated India Fixed comment. wasn’t trying promote it.  showcase people thinking.  mistake.  Imagine distopia vaccinated people quarantine,and go hiding. anti vaxxers think they've won, take society. 3 months, they're extinct, healthy people retake society. r/writingprompts think lot young people told really doesn’t matter people like them, risk COVID vaccine roughly same.

Spoiler: totally false. 

Let’s take worst known side effect Pfizer/moderna: anaphylaxis. 

Reports suggest somewhere 2 5 cases per million people. 

Let’s take high end say 1/200,000 chance getting anaphylaxis. 

There 2,500 deaths USA 18-29 year old age group. 

That’s 1 DEATH every 21,200 people age group. infected, ENTIRE POPULATION.

**So 18-29 year old’s risk DEATH covid, even without contracting it, 10X risk severe side effect Pfizer/Moderna.**

And btw, side effect lethal yet USA. I’m still amazed Provincetown results. 60000 people jammed bars, getting rowdy raunchy, slurring words, sharing drinks, poor ventilation, etc…. hundred confirmed cases popped up. negative test results vaccination status needed participate. bars required confirmed vaccination, all. 80+% population fully vaxxed. perfect conditions virus thrive higher percentage population vaccinated. Delta, too.  Yay! Here’s hoping rest state isn’t far behind! Vaccines massively effective. 90+% hospitalized unvaxxed.

From everything I’ve read (which lot), pregnancy definite comorbidity Covid, vaccines safe pregnancy. I’m doctor, I’d hate take advice anyone else’s find wrong. Love vaccine mandate enforcements. feels like real turning point. maximalists nearly harmful anti-vaxxers actively obstruct helpful measures.

Seriously? embarrassing juxtaposition. ""Vaccine maximalists"" promoting highly effective tool widely shields consumers severe disease, death even infection large degree. People fatigued measures past 17 months going carry normal activities regardless ""maximalists"" suggesting people take highly effective vaccine far outweighs advocacy measures. anti-vaxxers anti-vax, they've actively obstructing helpful measures since outset--people anti-vax support NPEs essentially exist. Even breakthroughs increase, vast, vast majority hospitalizations deaths occurring unvaccinated, people unvaccinated exactly anti-vaxxers want. embarrassing juxtaposition. two compared all. Outdoor lunches North Dakota winter going work well. play onto moment, honestly would take get trust it? clearly idea talking about. think important note significant waning effectiveness getting infected, severe disease/hospitalization. said, waning depends vaccine took. Based Israel's data Pfizer, decline large decline occurs 6 months. Moderna, per mayo clinic study, decline 6 months much less Pfizer.

see page looking boost, got Moderna fell 76% 6 months based mayo clinic study, would boost 6 months make sense? take probably yet, maybe 8 months?  got Pfizer, fell 42%, would take it? guess would, depending overall condition health age.

That said, pfizer moderna still remained effective hospitalization death, 3rd booster would essentially boost ability minimize infected all, important note, probability infection still zero - depend factors like health, age, viral load exposure, etc. Exactly. warn people. outright ban it.

Hopes dreams. improve people take seriously. Right now, many people, possibly most, view something *unfriend* FB, continue like nothing wrong. slow time. able see worked countries, plus urgent need vaccinated. don’t know outbreaks south peak soon almost nothing stopping it.

the outbreak south lasting longer one UK, Israel, etc. trajectories already peaked clearly not. states maybe getting close peak, even sure small scale level Yes. horrifying think Delta would done hospital systems without vaccines. That's huge success.

Of course would far successful measures used rigorously well. Probably could avoided today's dire situation hospitals maxing many cities. Who? Nah I’m good it. claim otherwise. I'm saying high collaboration, work. also forgetting outsourcing reach smaller shops difficulties hiring states due various differences labor laws, let alone counties. I've seen smaller shops struggle _Canada_. 

Outsourcing threat think is. creative regulation bound knowledge work. can't outsource accounting team hell would foreign accountant know American finance laws. outsource programming, happen aforementioned time gap issue. seen tried tech field. US programmers literal expensive programmers world. anyone outsourced us. never happens. need collaboration and/or cultural context goes shit. say cope, fact we've trying outsource field 30 years never stuck. I'll take sign. Honestly, that's fair assessment. NZ dragged (mostly) US domestic politics people find us map 2 years ago put us defensive position which, combined innate love talking internet, probably makes us somewhat unbearable online. wrong exacerbating already-pronounced parochialism.

I guess that's nature thing - I'm grateful effectiveness response ngl miss rest world :( probably seen this, shows mathematical modeling shed light it. 

the basic logic behind enough people get sick vaccinated outbreak slows down. israel countries went vaccination route, southern US choosing ""sick"" route Curous putting 300 towards student loans. know federal deferment wondering others doing. reason make :)  I'm sales rep drive work. much better fewer cars road, especially city's CBD.

Andalusia, near Málaga. thought got eventually linked back Vitamin E additive. may wrong, I'm fairly certain eventually figured one out. So, what's effect bats? make stupid?

If effect humans doomed. /s  Sure, here's one read yesterday:
 study: Yet kids died. yes approval would drop third.  Also, traveling air something quite infrequently, social activities would require masking almost daily occurrence. they've increased vaccinations even actually covering full salaries there? UK 80% cap 30k believe higher earners fucked anyway.  UK 25 18 year olds died entire pandemic. That's 6.5 million confirmed infections, likely many reality went undiscovered. 

The estimate 18's death rate COVID around 2 1 million.. 

I think kid likely die given day road traffic accident, via COVID. doesn’t work airborne virus R number around 6, also resides animals.

Only 10% 7.6bn ppl vaccinated. I'm looking work, make clear every recruiter contacts obly 100% remote non negotiable.

Just want participate ensuring market looks like be. need haircut!!! Another 6 weeks! turn lion soon Right, plus imagine hospitals twice full right now. good thing finally 50% vaccinated overall. us barely enough get fired anyways, bruh....

&amp;#x200B;

and there's reason fired yet. Lots people thread straight giving single fuck looking fully remote jobs if/when we're summoned back office again.

also forget there's labor shortage right now. Even lowest lowly ""common cashier"" hard find hire right now. waitresses, such. trickling know it, know it, people thread know it. Tbh don’t think government complacent response. worried contact tracing gonna handle large amount close casual contacts. Maybe people stop caring   never go back. fair went remote covid, chose leave given rather moved covid.

That said, I've saying 20 years dumb many people office, savings, pollution, etc, many good reasons. truly amazing seeing happening.

However, agree despite wrote, delta deadly. According article published Nature (“reduced sensitivity variant delta antibody neutralization), also likely evade antibodies. question think end sight? makes think delta last strain, won’t new ones developed September/October drive cases lead new lockdowns?

All lies beginning pandemic, think good faith, gave fuel anti-vaxxers later on.

Why US publish numbers ratios, infected vaccinated people often test 10 days ago? Give us truth ffs. thought leave NZ? that's case that's hardly ""normal"" lots families separated since 2021. sure mean. check rule.  Kids infected Delta variant get sick quickly. Data Canada shows kids infected Delta 2.75X risk hospitalization compared infected virus last year.

Do reliable confirmation this? usually seen ""we evidence worse kids."" I've seen least UK data indicating that, delta wave, lower percentage kids hospitalized relative original waves.

Anybody know truth? Mayo Clinic obviously trustworthy think data UK seemed pretty trustworthy too...?  got mad me, went outside smoke.

Hilarious.

The fear going trickle way good mate, wish success sourdough. 

This po-faced finger pointing I've seeing utterly tedious point. Like I'm personally fault people 12k km away back lockdown. Anyone relying entire global population simultaneously behave certain way comes across incredibly sheltered. 

Most world choosing vaccinate everyone wants it, move lives knowledge covid going anywhere. government choosing different path acknowledge decision - political choice made leaders. world really worked eliminating possibility instead eliminating actual virus. Dumb question whole deal vaccinated people high viral loads nasopharynx still less likely get sick probably shorter infectious period.. virus free-range nasopharynx? Compared garrison antibodies elsewhere body? 
So immune system effectively giving ground around face, letting further? Indonesia restrictions place weeks combat virus [Indonesia reviews virus Restrictions started July 1.

India states lockdown and/or restrictions movement. Yes obvious initial case link border must spreading. ""lockdown one case"" headlines, true, bit sensational. 

The real blessing initial case getting tested triggered alarm.  Employees only, customers fine without masks. 🙄 Regulations matter electing right people repeal/replace create right regulations make happen.


I promise politicians seeking election either get program lose seats younger millennials will. 


Millennials dying affordable housing. Corporate buildings abandoned en masse due WFH…. buildings used…. low hanging fruit politicians want end please weve lockdown almost 2 years isnt funny anymore - though differences dont seem radical looking areas concern - definitely quicker though, thees still least 50/50 chance I'd bet lot one major cause upward pressure salaries people unable find workers lower paying jobs. That's lot positions people move current roles. Even half jobs refilled still million job openings would be. 

Plus even 100,000 people died become disabled due Covid working that's yet openings now. never gave shit. $95 worth KNs coming

Hope sourced masks right. Something like half KN95's knock-offs. much preferable get NIOSH approved (so, N95) mask even South Korean version, KF94 almost always legitimate buy. Look Google exisits  office important why? Every new generation wants go back in. People either never worked person years going make push back offices. think younger people graduate move careers everyone go back person. Another thing bosses worried without anyone micromanage annoy fuck day, ineptitude waste salary might become apparent productivity stays even improves. might right call

Instead, starting week September 20th, fully vaccinated adults could begin getting booster shots 8 months second shot mRNA vaccine.” agree, time, I’m convinced enough us care one, random-to-us person rooms 500. imagine us generally already needed. (You’re wrong I’m arguing, I’m discouraged capacity exhibit emotional stability make virus). legitimate easy find KN95s good point. Plenty people wearing trash respirators good ones found price less.

They've developing decade. technology matured enough used actual medical practice. saying insurance model that's proven cost efficient every developed nation planet would magically cost efficient because... reasons.

Ok.  say that, realize banning them.  insurance companies start raising costs unvaccinated well.

This illegal Obamacare. Smoking status criteria used price discrimination premiums. Pre-existing conditions long gone. intelligence directly correlated good sense decency.  phrase ""moving goalposts"" refers someone changing argument something, previous point debunked proven wrong. people saying anti-vaxers move goalposts because, said ""I'll wait get FDA approved"" look different reason get it, vaccine *is* FDA approved. Pfizer Moderna? testing required Moderna vaccine?
I got moderna like support smaller companies often ignored media (eg reports moderna effective long term due less immunity wane). agree means FDA uselessly slow, right? fastest goalposts west! I'm vaccinated, oppose strongly. Least country (UK US). even support mandatory vaccination certain diseases - ie measles, meningitis etc- covid-19 (I even support mandatory vaccination older people covid-19). 

There situations absolutely understand covid-19 vaccine (previous infections covid-19), furthermore think young people theres definitely argument making personal choice 1 dose. people want refuse, them. right object medical procedure even clearly best interests hope goes easy you, symptoms barely started Thursday night worst comparable mild moderate cold.. I'm feeling 100% yet, feeling lots better.. Godspeed.. mean sue Pfizer negative side effect?   see door greeters more, even young.  sounds like Ermagehrd girl would pronounce “Community”  unique challenges

Of course. uniquely harder us EXIST generation. Life still suck least student loan debt job somewhat pays bills easier deal with. Take normal generational stuff add top crushing debt exist, know homeless die guess.  got first shot, wrote vaccine name card 2nd shot. typical bad handwriting medical people, took work ""Comirnaty"". actually make out, Google different vaccine names first...  target reached long ago developed countries. problem enough vaccines, enough vaccinated. problem sure, glaring one right moment. I'm actually kinda anxious Biden administration's plan require vaccine nursing homes.

Not I'm afraid get (already did), staffing nightmare gonna cause workplaces. case, we're already working short staffed, least 30-35 percent staff facility claims they'd quit covid vaccine mandated.

Things gonna get real interesting near future. sooner get exposed, fewer die. really need discourage mass wearing among anti-vaxxers. right life one person necessarily outweigh right free movement ten thousand others. many famous cases encroaching one multiple people's civil liberties justified even save people's lives. two famous cases come mind: Gäfgen (ECTHR) hypothetical shooting plane hijacked terrorists (German Constitutional Court). former, German police arrested person suspected kidnapping child. suspect confessed, however refused disclose location child. police know time suspect already killed child. So, proceeded ""enhance"" interrogation techniques; including strongly suggesting police would violently beat suspect tell child was. Eventually suspect caved gave location (murdered) child away.
The case comes hypothetical would legal plane hijacked terrorists threatened pull another September 11. military asked could shoot plane, ""only"" passengers board would die (they would die anyway terrorists flew building city). Court said ""No"", can't prioritise lives others can't sacrifice people.

Anyways, convoluted way saying cannot lock whole town indoors people tested positive coronavirus name shielding others virus.

No don't. Sure, spy people. Hack WiFi networks, wire tap, etc. anywhere near capacity actually use amount data. We've seen already: filling countless health declarations travel, fraction gets checked. Western countries simply manpower crazy top mass-surveillance. collect data want (make people fill forms not); still need police streets checking you, making sure following rules such.

And final point: China produces lot stuff, sure. develop it. use China cheap labour costs, they're somehow better... Still lot sophisticated components produced Taiwan, Japan, Korea even US Europe... no, China necessarily tech savvy. 56 hours usual flu-like symptoms? manufacturer? Yeah head marketing must Cirque du Soleil something, managed get head completely ass one. almost completely wrong. Several cities states already required government employees get vaccine EUA. Pentagon ordered weeks ago active duty vaccinated. Companies also require nothing else employment at-will, let workers go arbitrarily.

What changes gives everyone convincing teeth enforce it. ""It's experimental/untested"" longer valid statements, even superficially. Prizer's COVID-19 vaccine legitimate authorized many vaccines already get.  let past blind you. numbers 3 4 times higher elsewhere Europe.

If happened Netherlands, we'd new regulations. UK throws parties instead, 'this huge improvement three months ago...' So, long-term concert quinces = Wagner? asked question! Thank you!

That's kind weird name, like it. excellent. 10% u.s. population refuse covid 19 vaccine matter what, even means fired homless even imprisoned. continue see remote working conditions. anti-vaxxers die off, companies pay shit tons money

They've proven, last 18 months, change minds *anything* *nothing* help shorten pandemic save lives.  


My point 'both sides'-ing topic leaning mindset. But, okay, you. Also adding immunity future variants compared getting vaccine. think cases people getting Covid twice breakthrough cases. less 1% still significant difference. mean ""every developed nation"" exactly? nation universal healthcare different setup. talking UK? Germany? Singapore? They're different. 

Most better US system, too. I'm denying that. I'm saying, insurance companies problem getting rid probably enough address absurd prices Americans pay. fact, many developed nations mentioned still private health insurance companies!

I think legitimate concern single payer system US could heavily abused healthcare providers want stop gravy train. ignorant people causes high prices (and healthcare systems actually work countries) likely think happen. vaccine protects getting severely sick 95+% effectiveness.
Helps get sick 88+% effectiveness. manage get 40-60% chance able spread anyway.
This includes delta variant.

It prevent spreading it. Congress White House would make good move mandating vaccine employees. would think work mRNA? think that's theory... pretty sure that's they've always done.From one Mission:Deliver promise mRNA science create new generation transformative medicines patients.

I cannot arrested US criticized Joe Biden hung flag insulted Donald Trump. could China. That’s big difference. meant common name like paracetamol. Yeah case two (acetaminophen), cases one popular universally accepted name like methylphenidate, ibuprofen, amoxicillin etc. That’s meant. It’s usually written trade name smaller letters.     It’s popular opinion Reddit, I’ve said think it’s fine problem people waiting fully FDA approved. Okay, change point? vaccine significantly reduces spread proven evidence. everyone majority vaccinated would thereby significantly reduces spread across board would allow much normalcy public lives.

My first point stands pedantic going change it.  know. vaccines first started coming told coworkers “If we’re made get vaccine I’m going get J&amp;J one. Doesn’t use weird new mRNA it’s 1 shot.” Glad I’ve waited little deciding getting shot would’ve probably ended getting one. technically Basically meaning nothing changed, Emergency Use Authorization extend names vaccine want use? get silky luxurious hair hoping for. really viable option though, we're seeing struggles healthcare system US. like getting vaccinated getting COVID affects yourself, affects everyone cascading effect. infected person spread others, thus increasing hospitalizations, hospitalized puts strain healthcare system people part it. lessen transmission much *if get infected*. whole point vaccine much less likely infected first place. …there’s pandemic going highly infectious varian that’s spread aerosols, know right? post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

I’ve done research talked doctor numerous people know nurses. 90% said get vaccine. know rare side effects like vaccine that’s nervous about, I’m getting think. husband finally went today got first dose, he’d waiting this. family fully vaxxed almost 2 months now, hold out. feel like finally breathe sigh relief. brothers military (and vaccinated) told February “you get get 6 months getting it” Unsurprisingly shit load money went developing name make claim, link support claim, would contradict said did. Yeah bad too. state app. need one whole country. Though dont trust would roll fast well. ever good excuse graciously abandon “moral high ground” anti-vaccine people it. “Well waiting FDA approval”. (It’s unfortunate many died, untold thousands permanently damaged due vague uniformed moral stance.) ur antivax, still wear mask, still socially distant, good feeling one   Full approval involve additional health safety trials emergency approval does. Anyone waiting full approval safety concerns naive. good people get vaccinated still pisses ""experimental"" ""untested"" bullshit held us back long. Gotta acknowledge bubble personal biases; everyone spends day reddit reading this. people reddit think super informed really pass info back forth people similar completely miss perspective people completely different themselves. I'm celebrating risk reduction, get wrong. I'm celbrating enough throw away masks. accurate, threw away short time noticing infections going vertical spite high local vaccination rates. walk Walmart shoes, shirt? else could now? Australia. Every vaccine goes manufacturer though, pfizer, moderna, astrazenneca etc. admirable hope works sure 👍 side coin, company (a large one top ten Fortune rankings) taken time see giant office spaces important letting leases run lot buildings either people stay home good come back two days week share cubicles someone coming opposite days. allow communist infiltration precious bodily I’m ready this. don’t know unvaccinated ones know short-sighted, complain change, nitpick everything death vision future. aren’t low ranking people. company stronger better leaders care future understand risk. exactly uncommon, much less common among fully-vaccinated individuals compared others. According CDC, 60% state fully vaccinated. sure week 8/2 8/9, probably whole lot lower. means vast majority cases (82%), nearly hospitalizations (96%) deaths among ~40% population fully vaccinated. FAA require vaccines fly. safer people plane, reduces spread one region another, makes anti-vaxer's life miserable. LMAO   Come back scientific paper pop article full probablies.




You also kindly explain people catching COVID twice it. Yeah, know mandates gaining lot popularity, holdout adults like toddlers. force it, leads resistance. gotta get come right idea ""on own"". I'm glad see much positivity, though! expecting many people change minds, making hopeful!

Do think they've wanted get while, thought ""crap, get full approval, I'll liar"" (or something along lines)? Yeah better call Biontech guys actually developed instead funded it. mean even less likely better vaccine options going made available time soon? time like feel happy species people behind modern medicine, beautiful ""Com-urnaty""... reminds people say 'Murica Another way look getting vaccinated cuts chance death coronavirus factor 17. interest kill host

No, meant vaccination stop mutation, doubt. go say become clear clear vaccination reduce virus replication much everyone hoped.

As far see layman's perspective, fully understand vaccines reduce viral load much, yet understand much mechanisms cell death observable symptoms. Clearly, view simplistic (for virus) correspond evidence.   They’ve telling women bodies decades. 

Also- vaccines go school. It’s didn’t get polio. Good them. like nationwide. vaccine used emergency use authorization today. Today fully FDA approved.

Shit ""the side"".. can't celebrate without like ""hurr durr, anti vax"" people need stop poking bear let go back cave. lot people sharing anecdotes breakthrough infection nobody sharing anecdotes vaccine working, I'll share mine:

A weeks ago, unvaccinated significant infected very, close contact couple people tested positive several days row, textbook symptoms--respiratory, senses, digestive ones. close contact entire day multiple days row never infected. Moreover, larger group people contacts in, almost everybody infected period weeks--except limited number vaccinated ones. Additionally, also close contact infected person back May never infected either.

For context, I've pfully Pfizered 5 months, prior infection, even autoimmune disease, I'm technically immunocompromised! Breakthrough infections grab attention headlines, norm. still couple problems sound bite. 1) implies unvaccinated people dying. are, even smaller numbers. 2) Dying problem. also issues passing virus vulnerable individuals, sustaining pandemic, sustaining ongoing mutation, suffering long term disability. think would us service finding better way express well intentioned sentiment. What's name modified mRNA, though? transcript SARS-COV-2, all! happens they’re sick leave, then? COVID vaccines, treatments, tests used Emergency Use Authorization FDA whatever health agency allows use full approval. EUA drugs vaccines still go rigorous review process yet approved.

The rest people straight anti-vax also already easy path. nothing.  Hopefully allow overseas travellers enter they've FDA approved vaccine.   Pains say wife said last night….

Wonder antivaxxers excuse Fallen? think they've while. personally know one, knowing half people FDA approval affecting pretty cool!  current vaccination rate per capita Australia higher either UK USA ever achieved still rising. 

The problem vaccination Australia always supply government idiocy AZ vaccine.  Little know in-person necessarily going advance careers way think might. job though we've wave wave promotions past year half, much work done strict WFH period mid late 2020. yeah see younger people general motivated office socialize colleagues; burned BS corporate culture yet.

Making big assumption combining people group group B. thing can't tell side effects. know. people report breathing issues, report heart problems, others report pain specific areas, lots people report break cases. vaccine effective nearly effective everyone says is. mom received positive covid test vacinated multiple weeks. 

If fence getting covid vaccine, that's okay. feel pressured FDA approved one. Asses situation first. I'm it, people stop agressive trying get vaccinated? everyone would want knows exists, let make decision, need force ""GET VACINATED ASAP"" everyone's throat. beef N95s specifically?

My beef never targeted increased production N95s useful way. set mandate provide N95s everyone early on, rather saying masks work, scenario plays little differently feel. pretty severe shortage point

Which mandating availability public. discouraging hard time understanding brushing away supply situation like completely irrelevant

The supply issue entirely choice. Thats problem. Instead focusing delivering masks public, chose initially say masks work make sure good N95's health care workers, somehow coherent thought. switched said, ok wear masks get N95s get them, leave health care workers.

If instead, message could been, 'N95s going get us pandemic there's enough everyone right now. We're going try get supply health care workers right eventually expand supply everyone.' message shitshow since. Sounds less legit like prophecy.

Even reason wear one now. point would position mandated vaccines.

The things much harmful shouldn’t position even consider again.

I'm retired lawyer pharma work. studied FDA approval process advanced course law school. dialed listen streamed sessions EUA debated granted three.

Eh hard time feeling bad health insurance industry considering hell put people country. They'll still wildly profitable even paying covid treatments. Didn’t say FDA approval would take 2-3 *years*? Delta whole new ballgame Florida

Last year, Florida, kids went back school wearing masks. worried would upsurge cases, wasn't. generally good mask compliance kids, would keep mask throughout day, bus, take inside. 

This year, delta variant, whole different story. add Governor's bizarre insistence mask mandates; created worst outbreak had, unbelievable chaos. school officials disobey Governor imposed mask mandates. week school new cases exploding, can't even keep track them, home testing, numbers drastically underreported. Last week county 10,000 children teachers isolation quarantine. insufficient testing available. 

And going hospitals tells us variant like whole different virus. deaths previous surges, severely ill include many children young adults, happen before. starting see pretty severe breakthrough infections vaccine immunity waned, happening May.

We need totally new safety policies dealing variant. take governments long respond this; people need take heed self-protect. got booster pfizer 2.5 months 2nd dose. immunocompromised go much right now. worry long lasting be.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* one (of many) reasons IG great stuff. [She extensive difficult parse statements come without equivalent footnotes. vaccination required, yeah, I’d comfortable that. Unless you’re transplant recipient something, go good time vaccinated people. Pharmaceutical companies pour millions naming drugs. It’s science art come drugs trade name. 

As someone works around healthcare… never remember them. It’s lot easier trying name mRNA glycoprotein though. Didn’t feel comfortable went full paces. sufficient amount time passed I’m seeing minimal “long term” effects, full FDA approval feel makes sense now. changing subject again.  
They ones trusted health.  
The FDA is. 


And topic opened... no. like smoking. lifestyle choice transmit viral diseases.  
You can't go around giving people HIV believe virus want sex. called Bradley effect people respond surveys based think responses perceived.    today provided emergency use authorization. Basically fast-track approval there's pandemic important get people proven safe effective wait long-term studies things like immunity duration extremely rare side effects anywhere near statistical impact actual virus does. Yes, need wait 4-5 days last exposure want best chances test accurate. sounds like poor planning managers part. someone trained left. lot people upper management plan forever don’t sort succession plan place. solution shouldn’t someone learn job stay die leave everyone panic figure things themselves. That’s worked it’s fair next generation. nothing special older generations make capable. enough people able jobs. thing is, clue long pandemic last, also guarantee get pregnant within certain time.

I friend trying second child 2 years. got
Pregnant first without interventions. million tests 5 failed IUIs, moving IVF. 32. 

Another friend basically told 10 years trying chance. plenty testing tons rounds clomid. 

If really want children, it’s hard thing put ready, also guarantees happen you. 

Im currently pregnant, would preferred pandemic, medications need on. didn’t want start come get back them, chose get pregnant sooner rather later. Neigh, thank thee opportunity right dude. responses post show sub lacks social skills. don’t need understand them. soon they’ll it. That’s benefit “…and that’s order”    friend waiting full approval didn’t like emergency use meant couldn’t sue something went wrong. don’t even know that’s true something kept saying. Insisted biggest issue able sue. 

He died virus couple weeks ago though I’ll never know would gotten would moved goalposts. Oklahoma roughly half vaccinated 92% cases July unvaccinated people. that's without even getting hospitalizations deaths. squarely unvaccinated people. deserve blame. punish vaccinated they're supposed do.  Hey lockdown there's surefire way pass time couple Jeff Goldblum says ""Life..uh..finds way""  think filed couple weeks behind Pfizer, reason believe won’t approved, so, time now. minute heard I’d able schedule shot early thanks abundance old people region jumped. wife got first dose 10 days age group even eligible schedule. risking kids becoming orphans.

I felt little guilty first, early, realized would tossed happy.   reddit post based based article based reddit post?   /u/SnoopsBadunkadunk want fellow Americans get sick die?

Just asking questions almost like wanting FDA Approval never unreasonable first place.

Some dumbasses certainly move goalposts, people genuinely wanted approved vaccine. is, seems okay, decided go hospital though get sick would take care stayed home. 3rd grade teacher think picked school how. 2Fast2Pfizer before? Oh god...it's ""Renesmee"" drug names. 90 days. mind citing scientist saying alpha/wild type antibodies “don’t seem help infection?” WOW...Who comes stuff? Lol 100% genuine! 2 people exciting  fork analogy still great here. 

The vaccine gives body blueprint fork. body makes fork realizes fucking HATES forks burns blueprints ground puts photo wall saying destroy future forks. 

In comes fork salesman body already knows do. That's vaccine. still targeting spike protein going effective original vaccine original strain COVID. Like said first response you: ""they change sequence mRNA vaccines match Delta""

This type sequence change match circulating strains ALREADY discussed FDA require much shorter safety review: new vaccines particular developed quickly inexpensively, seeing lot new candidates near future.

If target different viral structure spike protein take 1.5 years minimum. That's assuming get emergency approval like originals did, part emergency use authorization effective tool fight virus - vaccines target spike protein. thing infect everyone 1.5 years. We'll back normal novel vaccine targets COVID19 get approved. also get 30 companies trying develop new vaccine pay-off much less Pfizer Moderna already 95% effective. market forces strong OG COVID19 vaccines. OK convince vaccine nuts take now? feeling response contain something ""I trust anyway""  bet Germany calls Biontech vaccine US calls Pfizer vaccine lol. goal post flimsy, even properly attached ground.

As soon heard knew would moved immediately.  it’s important understand risks getting covid vaccinated? really isn’t hard understand. Nobody wants thing, course face reality fact thing. scientist? Yeah I'm thinking back think right, ones drawn white. Except Nick Hispanic? Think marketing campaign. 

Don’t naughty. Get comirnaty. It’s okay get mRNA vaccine one initially received isn’t available. 

To find vaccination location near (US) preferred vaccine: booster immunocompromised: FWIW, employer started giving boosters select immunocompromised people week. people wearing those, would also keeping people hospitals much protecting working them. think nurses would appreciate well.

I think nurses doctors risking health every minute shift try keep others alive better allocation extremely limited number masks had. highest risk infection they're constantly exposed we're seeing happens enough -- think Alabama technically bed space available one staff We've known masks work since least late 1800s. Thats hospitals started using began much broadly adopted 1918 pandemic flu broke out. ""leading edge discovery"" regarding whether masks work not. abject refusal accept history disease prevention.

It's really simple. Yes, we've known long time masks work really really well. recall though, early thinking virus' spread primarily large droplets lead CDC think distancing probably enough scenarios -- want reiterate even enough masks highest risk caretakers. recommend taking look [this thinking based flawed assumptions. 

So yes, transmissible things figure fly result changes view virus. pretty clear based generally accepted scientific community time must close proximity infected (doctors, nurses) wear masks. others, seemed, standing outside 'range' prevented infection. error caught, guidance updated interim managed ramp mask production everyone option protect others much possible. flip flopping, taking new information account adjusting accordingly. recently. great job keeping now. also seems shortage shovels reason... got first dose Pfizer vaccine two days ago. never feel safer now. helps all, smallest needle I've ever experienced entire life. also think arm full second. know might help apprehension towards needles, promise really REALLY easy virtually painless Science process methodology, really something describe certain. There's even uncertainty whether current practice science best practice teasing knowledge universe. Heck go total ""chain increasingly perfect islands"" here, would say certainty better practice exists. find hilarious antiva cry vaccine mandates/passports oppression tyranny government. Meanwhile, Native Americans, legitimately victims oppression tyranny mandating vaccines high vaccination rates. doctor asks smoke start every appointment. government say body!

I say attended school required specific vaccinations, Working job required specific vaccinations, driving road requires seatbelts intoxicants, eating food regularly tested federal regulations maintain suitable safety levels goes body. 


HEAVY FUCKING /S wasn't. hope insurance companies longer cover people hospitalized COVID unvaccinated. People seem fear debt death. think lot people get motivated get vaccinated run risk massive hospital bill. pretty ridiculous many levels like universal healthcare? massive hospital bill scary dying? donno think would push large chunk fence side.

Friend mine went cvs, asked third shot - added existing card gave shot, questions all.  Glad hear people waiting full approval actually exist. 
The line, “But it’s even fully approved yet!” often seems like bad-faith argument people move next excuse now. Literally would solved problems situation. Pfizer shot truly tiniest little shot I've ever had, honestly barely felt it. used suppository.

Here's one serology study: Perhaps could combine make nice, cool chili soccer practice. call Covfefe Again, wrong simply rapid vaccine development makes possible. mRNA tech, lucky enough tested working cancer vaccines pandemic (I neighbors Moderna know well), enables possibility. defeatist attitude rooted reality, pretending realistic, good thing. animal reservoirs politically charged become, possible stick around. straight say still chance eradicate actually accurate matter feelings matter. Again, lot comes attitude presenting listening experts. level arrogance coming laypeople, misinformation post, perhaps argument stand on, certainly mystical data cite really show believe does. That's hot. Sounds Pervy.  cannot properly track natural immunity. also consistent sure thing everyone.




Antibodies also fade time. one-and-done deal like chicken pox.




Think like flu. catch probably catch flu two weeks later, three months later? Maybe. Six months? Possibly. year? knows.



 However, get flu shot, feel significantly less miserable get flu all. also less likely give flu others due vaccine neutering virus trying take hold.




Roughly principle COVID, except COVID significantly contagious dangerous standard flu, COVID vaccines significantly effective current flu vaccines due new tech used make them.  honestly sure exactly probably varies state. I'm since getting vaccine back March, went PCP OBGYN noted saw vaccine status updated. signed vaccine enter info person signing dose CVS. federal mandate that's correct.

The issue, Florida least, state leadership decided prevent local schools issuing mask mandate. Which, court cases resolved least, legally allowed do. Absent federal mandate, legal authority make public health law choose. :/  start professionals experienced mask wearing warned us good mask discipline hard. also help anti-mask sentiment still around people push back much strangers see nose sticking mask loose around face. masks I've gotten day one ones tie tighten put on, elastic ones around ear always fit tight wear out, knew would problem remember.

I'm surprised hospital lot strict employees, talking visitors?  May day much chocolate cocoa it. know lot people joking moving goal posts good opportunity. Take fig leaf, get crazy, train.

That said, true kind vaxxine really, question whether get rid infection quickly completely undetectable, unnoticable (asymptomatic), mild...  yes. mRNA vaccines safe too. expect everyone wear Mormon underwear intimate times 😄 poggers rates increase towards 100% without anyone new getting vaccines.

Not rain even grim parade, immunity vaccines looks like lasts 6 12 months. trying reach high levels vaccination like trying fill bucket hole it. lot water going in, trickle. really worry companies pocket cost savings needing offices etc. pass dollars onto employee (in future) need dedicate office space working home. also worry cities empty buildings contributing urban decay. one get past paywall? Serious question here, would take convince them?

They say vaccine came nowhere.

But, mRNA vaccines thing since 17 years ago? Correct I'm wrong here, I'm genuinely asking.

Also, vaccines currently used get EUA six months satisfactory study completed emergency use authorized? further, 171 million people fully vaccinated largest ""study"" ever done vaccine? There's much data full FDA approval obviously going happen.

I guess understand hold people saying ""it's FDA approved therefore safe."" FFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUU- mandated vaccinations job they'd probably temporarily shut got new workers. hospital US full covid patients.

Oh, right, ones making money give fuck that. :( point can't different position WHO. hard believe argument logistically possible give poor part world vaccines, yet, advocates it. would advocate impossible solution, topic leading authority, sounds implausible me.

Health care workers prioritised anyone getting booster dose, you! giving health care workers rich countries booster doses really main concern since small amount people (compared whole population). would happy see get one, really issue.

Thankfully, expected, stayed right glovebox leaving getting back driveway, police site direct traffic could also respond incident curbed worries had.
 
I'm hoping simple argument turned violent minimal injuries unrelated sort motive. I'm glad antivax/antimask bs going heard violent attacks sites really hope see going on. 1400 week getting neighborhood. 

I'm sure there's scuttle inside DeSantis cave. use ""Draconian"" misleading.

China shifted away blanket lockdowns, cities (in large country) locked time around. main tools mass testing, contact tracing restrictions travel regions large numbers infections. cities infections, ""Draconian"" measure people experienced get tested several times span weeks.

The response finesse less blunt. think blunt instruments (large-scale lockdowns) would come less intrusive measures seem working. Thanks, saw too.

Again, agenda whether not, much, vaxxed person infectious. Great news seem less infectious, obviously.

However, paper sent ALSO small N=161 vaccinated healthcare workers, BTW, know one excites more... absolutely sucks can’t find J&amp;J vaccine anywhere…I’m needlephobic I’m really hard time coming terms get stuck twice guess don’t really choice Sure it’s safe. safe medication. you’re going administer medication millions people you’ll always see won’t take well majority. That’s always been. zero covid would cease soon happens. point. would taken Pfizer I'm injecting cringe Hopefully step closer getting vaccine approved kids now. 

I know safety science leading factors decision, FDA approval help people feel confident bringing fruition.  think one older technology use mRNA. Maybe that's why? risk calculation everyone make themselves. vaccinated healthy, worried. Go away! Baitin.. Perfectly cromulent. I’d argue sometimes run doctorate holders who’ve lost specific sauce long everything else foreign them. Breadth vs depth that. Lol, first question ask recruiters ""is 100% remote?"" Yes. It’s going called Comirnaty.  controversy Provincetown data simply due gay parties hookups? tone wreaks sentiments dangerously misclassified AIDS “homosexual cancer”. delta variant easily spread poorly ventilated indoor spaces regardless specific (unmasked) activity, reason treat Provincetown outlier. Believe know. matter them. Last antivax person argued simply told covid already fine dont want take vaccine that's around 1 year. They'd rather take chances covid again. +100 borrow binoculars? Trying find goalposts moved now. Tribe crisis, one instincts reproduce keep numbers, think. People thread answering questions I've chance ask “Why test rigorously it’s supposed totally safe? Checkmate.” Doubleplusgood Thank y’all work vaccine formerly known Pfizer can't nuanced point view!!!!!!! enough. Honestly good thing. average age upper management workers soared nearly 1 1 age boomer generation. read article long ago average age new CEO’s 1980s around 45. it’s approaching 70. boomer generation refused retire high paying management positions, causing stagnation career growth limited opportunity younger generations. need eduction experience higher expectations get promoted compared older generations. older generations reaching age millennials now, much ladder career. It’s past time start retiring finally give opportunity younger generations. Corona defeated 'Naty, think marketing potential! know risks J&amp;J, far outweighed benefits. know anecdote, partner got regrets. Two weeks full vaccination instead six also huge plus. Help feel better researching look regards rare side-effects. like children, name 9 months initially devolped. named fetus super early parents. know else carries increased health risks long term data for? COVID.  There's doctor Alabama who's refusing see unvaccinated patients. think encompasses harm oath well. bigger picture, doctors follow force people get vaxxed, causing less harm. Big picture. yeah, that's thought. so, antivaxxers gonna move goalpost now? Tom HR sucks. read book fairy tales.  Exactly. also assume company name moderna stands mod(ified)-rna I. time know optimal span doses. 

We also necessity 1 dose effective Alpha better vax people 1 dose give smaller amount people 2 doses. ""What if... ask gop members sneeze other's face greeting??!!""  16 74, according article. Plenty abnormalities report here, mostly mental.. case, preexisting. I'm still waiting tail grow. long ""long term effects"" honestly tie vaccine any? I'm genuinely curious sort effects they're expecting happen. You’re wildly delusional think we’re going keep next days let alone years. Implantation porting Wholeheartedly agree sentiment randomly assumes 15 million new vaccinations would otherwise 100% covid infection rate lol. excuses Workers leaving absolutely affects company’s bottom line funny people say trust government,  say FDA approved... like would care approved already trust Great news lot standard vaccines use tech J&amp;J mRNA totally new thing concerns silly &lt;insert anecdote(s) surprising least. 

Horrible, awful, disgusting, degenerate, murderous, loathsome, foul, etc.? YES.  


But surprising. made sense prior versions Covid 19, Delta game changer spreads vaccinated people well.

Solution vaccinate people asap spread contained without crazy lockdowns. Totally unclear saying here.

The best way save someone else would give vulnerable person dose would good booster.

Once vulnerable vaccinated, booster healthy 30 year olds would start make sense. FWIW, *many* medical experts agree this. SpikedVax let's goooo   I'll tell paramecium is! THAT'S paramecium! one-celled critter brain CAN'T FLY! Also, Moderna twice many doses per vial. 15 vs 6. 35 geriatric pregnancy hot. ask important didn’t matter anyway? simultaneously important thing also irrelevant? never answer. approval take long? way parking lot.  like FAA needs make required. thanks kind words! Got J&amp;J, sleep night due fever. Thought going call sick went work anyway completely fine work, sleep deprived. symptoms that. Unfortunately lot currently unvaccinated regular primary care physician.  

So yes, good thing.  think impact going marginal. feel like that's way we're going win - literally threaten peoples' livelihoods ability many things want need (like travel)....let make decision ""be free"" get fucking vaccine. zero covid impossible even 100% vaccination, vaccines protect less delta deltas immunity treshold. maybe delta specific vaccines possible. never 100% vaccination rate, means everyone either vaccinated get virus unvaccinated U.S., vaccines authorized ""emergency use"", based early trial data. companies since submitted much extensive data millions vaccinations given since then, FDA reviewing data.

Anti-vaxxers always come illogical excuses.  get agree certain extent still encouraging people much possible. need get shots arms you’re going much success attitude.

Yeah know it’s *technically* called Corminarity/hook loop, uh, I’m gonna keep calling Pfizer/Velcro. situation make decisions bed space low. got 1 bed, pick person likely survive. give someone bed they're going die? That's I'm saying. back primary care doctors. someone needs see theirs, make requirement vaxxed seen, get board. gotta whatever takes. 1% chance getting disease first place WFH get everything delivered? Well wasnt before, understand people iffy college, I'm going assume classmates able vaccinated? college vaccine mandate already, lobby implement one.

Adjusting going back crowds going take discomfort. glad cohort get vaccinated. Link? Dolly probably helped name Moderna! lame old white men named Pfizer’s know nurses know would've take N95s anywhere could get last spring.

And people wearing those, would also keeping people hospitals much protecting working them. think nurses would appreciate point article we've leading edge discovery process this.

We've known masks work since least late 1800s. Thats hospitals started using began much broadly adopted 1918 pandemic flu broke out. ""leading edge discovery"" regarding whether masks work not. abject refusal accept history disease prevention. McD's seems unlikely due 2 reasons:

1. franchisees. Would pain enforcement ranks.

2. They're already struggling get employees many locations. limiting workforce options would bad staffing.  Man, fuck friends.

People looking excuses get vaccinated entire time. shouldn’t come pat back they’re willing now. United States position it’s *because* people like friends.

And people need pat back *pushing getting vaccinated*, they’re shitty people. know third shot gives longer immunity not. said new people, assumed people who've already vaccinated get boosters. assuming vaccinated people basically taken equation far generating virus mutations (""a couple breakthrough infections""). 

This conventional thinking recently, think idea starting break down. Breakthrough infections seem much common expected, viral loads (and thus mutations?) vaccinated people seem comprable unvaccinated people, least initially. Wondering questions would like answered would make feel confident getting vaccinated week. Vaccination great way protect getting severely ill covid-19, encouraged get vaccinated soon protect 🙏 True, also first examples mRNA vaccines utilized human populations. it’s bit false comparison look historical data. I’m hoping conclusion carries vaccines well however get Pfizer booster. Mixing matching fine. I....really can't see Comirnaty catching on. R0 rose 5+ Delta, current vaccines efficacy transmission \~0.8 going provide herd immunity without NPIs. Seem likely we'll eventually exposed, vaccinate face 25x higher risk hospitalization, among 50+, 17x higher risk death.

And perhaps lifetime looking strangers, judging whether donning N95 company warranted. Wait exactly? There's nothing left FDA approval good luck creating foolproof quarantine system. 

What NZ works. Much better US here, least. 'doubts' strategy, might end changing something broken. Whenever I've heard term ""moving goal post"" I've always pictured upright. makes much sense. Brutal. 🤘🏼 It’s even less that. 10% country says never get vaccine, portray group vast majority.  Almost every company provides subsidized Health Ins. employees mandate it, guise ""health safety"", keep Ins. costs spiraling due non-vaxxed health issues.  Yeah, that's line spouted government masses accept roll it. think parent's generation misses point D-day celebrated begin with. set expectation next generation brave soldiers, D-day fucking sucked people fighting next generation another D-day. several existing diseases vaccines require 3 doses. ""obvious"" different need 3 COVID vaccines, time yet observe data showing either possibility. saw that. That’s arrogant.  ""if lose medical freedom"" welcome american healthcare system, first time? used test-negative case–control design estimate effectiveness

Well, better job car manufacturing team named car ""Nova"" tried sell Mexico. county 20%. family member tell friend vaccinated able stick quarter injection site. Science... Ah, people take ""communist"" vaccine. refused mandatory training. need fired. mean, masks literally security theater none us wearing N95. big wig even admit TV? Realistically, age group super low risk, shot well known side affect profile feeling flu like symptoms, US fostered real sense community generation.

He'll, half media anti-boomer memes. bother somethings finally problem?

That said, got vaccine happily myself. trying understand perspective. Quick glance seems going 'they can't sued bad things take risk fully stand product'. Except sued Europe. Also, think something came Pfizer vaccine dangerous consumer confidence drugs would plummet would stock. got vaccination health care provider, government thing all, except maybe background. government often involved nobody else could handle logistics scale.

If 20-29's think, they're going ton self-inflicted problems need stop blaming ""the government"" woes. afib heart surgery many years ago, doctor told get vaccine circumstances. deserve lose job? [oh, you’re forcing take  “my sister’s husband’s second cousin’s father doctor said…..” favorite prevent getting infected vaccine (nevermind vaccine 100% effective) even though vaccine prevents severe illness death still vaccine! Must depended area. Maine security guards door getting without mask. COBRA joke. It’s basically like bridge plan expensive is. That's silly.

Yeah… maybe odds beat it, idea knowing whether one ones kills actually go it. Quincy good guy .. pls get vax hunch.. 

Perhaps, 4 even better 3? 

And maths right, 5 better 4. I’m part Moderna master race. still hang friends got Pfizer. Novavax seems legit don’t know anyone got it.

I meet mates got AZ J&amp;J, outdoors masked.

But Sinopharm weak shit? That’s gonna dawg.  could play antivax bingo  Meanwhile, Moderna SpikeVax. 

I really think one targeting big unvaccinated populations calling vaccine something like Monster Zero Ultra Corona.  first joking excuse morning That's countries zero CoVID generally strict quarantine measures border. Can't save willing saved/save themselves.  


And still, comes hope harm others stupidity. know, chances slim still hope. Well, went lockdown soon found out, still community spread lockdown started. remains seen lockdown able get back 0 cases. extended lockdown. lot them, yes... employers going mandate it. expecting Pirates Caribbean “but heard me” Sweedish, big, dumb, balding North American ape chin short temper. They're waiting someone YouTube tell what's data dump. *completely* different scenario multiple fronts. Vaccines thing masking far less prevalent. 

1.	The first cases came overseas, hence NYC getting hit hard it’s international hub. Considering Delta came overseas well, would think would seen significant spikes reason, even considering travel restrictions. 
2.	The northeast generally densely populated (easier virus spread) south. happened yet? whole non-approval FDA bullshit argument first place, care FDA approved since gubbermant. Already heard first one coworker... actually waiting for… Sorry meant 40 years age. First mil/last boomer born 80 iirc.

Gen x was, bad better mils. mils better z. getting shittier shittier.

I guess point hope decent enough go enjoy life escape existiatisl dread. becomes less likely every year move closer closer back fuedalism. It’s dependent Moderna submitted FDA full approval (it connection EUA date), don’t think Pfizer Yup! numbers encouraging, honestly. fully vaccinated person, COVID mostly non-issue now, barring you’re old severely compromised immune system. long term data argument actually true though rebuttal it.

There's simple obvious rebuttal. There's comparably long term data COVID infection, especially talking newer variants. compare infection vaccination time horizons we're aware of, vaccination overwhelmingly safer alternative. also unheard vaccination complication onset delayed several months years inoculation. There's examples kinds different vaccines led severe side effects never case side effect arise year later. 

Any reasonable risk/benefit analysis general public would land side vaccination.  still won’t enough anti vaxxers lol  people distrust vaccine waiting data dump

Lol. aren't. Let’s go!!! important think about, certainly good reason keep old office standard place. business usual? thought they’d locked down? Hey! Joey Jo-Jo! doctors. 

Education directly correlated intelligence. surprised people agree continued employment depends it. moved goalpost different they're willing get vaccinated take dinner, make puppy eyes, ask nicely calling honey love?

No, think so.    This. Calling Tozin would unforced error. Except can't think single way escape since large majority people dead set staying unvaccinated. China eradicated virus year ago, able rapidly contain every subsequent outbreak. Since virus eradicated, restrictions daily life within China.

It possible reach maintain zero CoVID. too.  stupid name, yes, sounds nothing like ""COVID-19 vaccine,"" maybe Pfizer work that.

Now brand name, anticipate we'll start seeing commercials it. Pfizer smart, call vaccine commercials, they'll say ""it's proven way prevent coronavirus, blah blah blah legal text, ask doctor Comirnaty today."" buy shit-ton ad time Fox News. vaccination choice. move china fill fantasy welding close doors choosing differently think best. boomers ended long that. forgetting gen x'ers forgotten generation. 

gen x millennials millennials. every story youth 80s 90s slackers drive motivation.

source: gen x. Nurses need BSN want work hospital. worn nursing home physician offices, RN still considered OK. mean like study linked article say one hate break say so, want doesn’t make inferior. COVID drug team’s working past year also got approved, corporate chose name

I promise it’s even worse unless negatively impacts Ohio State (only kidding... kind of) bad 30-40% American population could care less common good. Anti-mask, anti-vax, Anti-common-good! vaccinated EU, back April. vaccine got Pfizer, card digital covid passport says ""Comirnaty"" time. totally agree understand. science matter antivaxxer though they'll stick fact around years excuse get it. reality Pfizer paid way many people name got committee candidate.   That’s different discussion irrespective WFH, I’d argue. Lumping WFH conflating issue. test it. tested it. found safe... gave emergency approval safe. like double sure safe. tested lot found safe. fully approved it.  lie manager said subscribed WSJ get affirmation forcing us back office okay  ""The plural anecdote data"" sell many ads, unfortunately. Tbh much prefer modernas name, think calling ""spikevax"" might sound menacing people already hesitant. expect submit approval end September. I'd expect late October. Get second opinion. recommendation stands, going wear mask (possibly even around immediate family). getting vaccine potentially dangerous, getting Covid going horrible. no, long valid medical reason, lose job. surprising considering 4x many people Vaxxi Mc Vaxxface  Source 358? says 4.1 beds per 100,000 5 million people 230 oh wait real?

Meh *(via FDA's Acting Commisioner Says Recommending Children 12 Years Age Get Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine FDA Says Data Needed Certain Pfizer Vaccine Safe Children  data AZ plus mRNA suggests that's best protection anyway I'm bears out, want see data first.

What...? obviously saying every breakthrough case illnesses. marketing Great Value brand. found draconian quarantine also reduces automobile accidents. recommend one ever leaves house ever What’s excuse now? Get vaccinated haven’t already!  much secret Basically got spikevax'd twice grocery store! Good you! That's companies going look signals others going thing. They'll feel comfortable employees can't run competitors avoid it, since competitors requirement.

It's already happening large tech companies. job super sus know Janssen J&amp;J. reports myocardia J&amp;J, though few, enough discourage fence sitters. Humans really shitty evaluating risk. 

1% chance vaccine causing complication? Oh no, me.

1% chance dying COVID? I'm healthy I'm worried it.

We suck. really % total cases. total 72 cases last weeks 35 new cases one day, that’s 50% increase spread. basically dominated covid extremists want use excuse enact authoritarian socialism. Pfizer submitted May 7th. Moderna submitted roughly 3 weeks later June 1st. would expect roughly timeline Moderna Pfizer.

In case, roughly 3 weeks now, September 13th.  get opposition affluent countries move forward boosters, time, receiving booster go winter seems like pragmatic, proactive approach. Yup. I’m California neighbors assumed c0nservative. Flags everywhere. never wore masks outside even everyone else did….until got fire smoke air air quality bad. sudden, wearing. Cause affected them. Please joking Sounds like Mountain Dew flavor. fight every day.  


Which worse? know truth what's happening world (but maybe mentally happier) know truth hopefully keep safe (but deal mental repercussions knowledge)?  


I *tell* better know... I'm still sure yet. :( coworker. told something vaccines weakening immune system. added “yeah you’ll turn yellow become gay”. think silently nodded. — U.S. gave full approval Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine  
Monday, milestone could lift public confidence shots  
spur companies, universities local governments make  
vaccinations mandatory. dont understand, one yet available NA? EU using months even though one seemingly better ones kind miracle magically solve covid felt like really bad cold lasted week.

That's good? certainly help angry other. hear guy Shane Company’s ads? masks incredible tools helping us contain spread virus, N95 not. N95, understand, offers individual protection, that's point masks. less prevent getting COVID, emphasis trying stop people potentially spreading it. “It’s approved FDA force people get it” 

They don’t trust government doctors FDA approved means nothing them. work already took Moderna J&amp;J vaccine? employer mandates Pfizer vaccine, guess get exemption already one vaccines. Hahahaha thanks. pretty random actually, inside jokes anything. silliness.

Many thanks! goes plan, even start looking, gut's telling will. I'm sure I'll fine either way. Bit broken window fallacy though. money wouldn’t disappear, would migrate sectors economy. 

Not spending $120/month gas more? Great, get coffee espresso every day local cafe. buy new clothes actually wear outside hours 9-5. Ticket revenues go maintenance cost roadways due less traffic. Transportation departments spend less highway expansion improving existing roadways transit options. mean sad truth lot markets Amazon Walmart basically option employment let alone employment $15 hour. Particularly economically decimated areas coincidentally vaccine uptake lot lower. Bessemer Alabama, etc. got DoubleSpikeVaxxed. sounds cool? do? sit around waiting next covid surge settle half stuff used surges again, rinse repeat? heard her, asking God help out.

Probably accurate. come rnaty US, CDC's advisory committee meeting next Monday, August 30th assume they'll discuss updated guidance booster shots then. stands now, Moderna booster dose first two shots, recommended immunocompromised persons. We'll see guidance shifts general population. fact arrogantly assume elimination right strategy means course would think that.

I arrogantly think elimination best response. trust experts crunched numbers said best strategy, [academic abstract: lowest cumulative COVID-19 death rate OECD 242 times lower 38-OECD-country average. considering “excess deaths”, NZ largest negative value OECD, equivalent around 2000 fewer deaths expected. considering average GDP change five quarters 2020 2021-Q1, NZ sixth best performer. 

We also lowest unemployment rate decade June 2021 quarter.  lowest deaths among best economic outcomes. actually try get done alternative way.

So much harder basically Western country tried alternative way succeeded. look around peers see nothing failure, except NZ Australian states, insanity stupidity copy them. cases country needs get vaccinated, check spike vaccinations NZ Covid back, human beings need incentive. 

Rubbish, NZ vaccination rate higher outbreak. already reached 56,000 people vaccinated day, record number, day outbreak. already peak capacity daily vaccinations system could handle. little vaccine hesitancy NZ never AZ option concerns blood clots. hope gets control NZ finally face facts move towards Covid normal vaccinated population.

When go get booster shot problem? issue new one copy information, and/or willi carry two vaccine cards? basically always restrictions? given vaccinated U.K. it’s likely much lower numbers possible without restrictions significantly higher proportion people naturally immune is. 

It’s pretty much either live permanently restrictions embrace numbers like this. call Nessacary. What’s mode vaccine? RNA. Nice !  wait get sick regret decision... sadly that's way believe vaccines they’re Risk? Probably chance humanity become intelligent.

That said, mutations particular virus *may* affect response. Otoh, researchers working universal mRNA vaccine effective variants. We'll see. Given expertise, I'd really like hear this. questions:

1) Given large contingent people US, Europe, America believe freedom movement costs, would governments enforce extended lockdown? attitudes compliance nations much different AUS/NZ.

2) Given world country exist borders land borders, prevent cross pollination countries lockdowns enforced vs countries aren't?

3) governments like US entitlements limited, prevent personal economic destruction among mostly poor extended periods? First thing see article like stick Google see else comes up. case search Fenofibrate Covid many pre-covid hits came up.

Looks like real deal me. proven...no big randomized trials yet. preliminary findings coming many countries look promising.

Idk got downvoted, people want go back, though I'm sure majority like article states. gf one hates working home whole week. extrovert going crazy working home. unable separate work life does. I'm opposite - I'll whatever work home rest life. Lol. Well they're going statement made Surgeon General press briefing why, today, announcing plan stay ahead virus prepared offer COVID-19 booster shots fully vaccinated adults 18 years older. would eligible booster shot eight months receiving second dose Pfizer Moderna mRNA vaccines. plan start program week September 20th, 2021.

, nothing really said them. think article questioning 8 months came first place. guess wait additional info come 3rd dose rollout  Good!  dunno, kinda find Comirnaty sound sort elegant, whereas SpikeVax (moderna’s official name) obvious almost jokey sounding.

Obviously don’t actually care. anyone taken Sputnik? feel? ostracized like deadbeat ex-husband 2nd wedding. people absolutely shut get vaccine rapid test everyday show clean. Restaurants, offices, federal buildings, etc. shut out. Get. The. Vaccine. No, meant there's risk jump llamas. we're careful, alpacas next! Obesity symptom diseases, including PTSD, endocrinology issues, poverty, more. Furthermore, evidence shows weight loss via diets even surgery usually fails long term, something patients fix easily own. weight-loss easy maintain ""obesity epidemic"" first place.

Being anti-vax symptom nut-case. Getting vaccines something patients easily own, especially sense currently free patients.

We already allow insurance companies charge smokers. anti-vax penalty would similar.  keep seeing comment sub figured I’d offer perspective. 2 year old 6 month old pandemic started, I’m 36 weeks pregnant. One silver lining pandemic, me, able spend time kids due working home. gotten spend every day pregnancy home instead commuting work every day. peaceful pregnancy long shot. I’m vaccinated privilege staying home risk factors regarding covid pretty low. Evangelicals, that’s why, personal opinion given since would get moderated (again)    people already made third infection. Vaccine hesitancy reminds big social media bottled water scare years ago. remember getting concerned email distant family member scared bottled water contained “sodium chloride” sodium chlorine poisonous. break sodium chloride salt, salt trace minerals added make purified water taste like water. much confusion basic elementary school science country combined utter lack critical thinking skills it’s amazing we’re able get anything done all. far.

Samsung way add vaccine records Samsung Pay, requires downloading third-party app needs access medical records. app governed HIPAA laws. says share medical information third parties, app states privacy policy share personal information like demographics, name, location, contact published February in JAMA demonstrated reactions rare: 4.7 cases per million doses 2.5 cases per million doses reported among first 17.5 million doses administered two mRNA  I’ve never sort conversation her, almost certainly. Nearly entire family Covid deniers. Awww mom dog named Spike. got moderna one. bet they'll also apply formal approval. Emergency Use Authorization typically kept force long needed. approved vaccine exists, need extend EUA vaccines. manufacturers want keep selling shots, they'll get approval well. Moderna probably far behind Pfizer, J&amp;J finished trials quite bit later, might take longer collected enough data final approval process. Yes, definitely unfortunate, me, really cause office work, issue poorly educated dog owners. much so.

This quadrupled birth control. terrifying... People talk pregnancy greater risk health. Talk doctor. able make better recommendation random Reddit users. Strangely worldometer deaths per day graph florida agree title. hits little different disease dangerous children though.   Lol riding fine line ""immunocompromised"" like trick employees feeling loyal social group. Maybe infinite Assist Trophy Glitch Smash Ultimate would better. way. I'm definitely going look getting dosed early-mid-October, 2nd shot end April.

I want healthy work's Halloween &amp; holiday events, Dammit! Object permanence issues, like baby. Nah really care anymore. happy fuzzy stories people getting finally great, majority gonna this. fuck it, mandatory vaxx stay fuck anywhere privately owned. school staff required provide proof vaccination least one dose Covid-19 vaccine September 27, mayor said.

Why wait Sept 27th? one need month decide get first dose. need get first dose first day school (Sep 13th)! point hard trust anything anymore. thing is, clue long pandemic last, also guarantee get pregnant within certain time.

Wouldn‘t point also worth considering children, though? 

If one choice risking 9 month pregnancy outlook wether situation hospitals gonna get worse well risking catching covid thing already EXTREMELY taxing body. 

And choice waiting risk life well baby‘s run risk go IVF. 

While climate change looming definitely going change things worse (also thanks population rise)…

I'm hoping news triggers 15% unvaccinated get first month. alone get us need be, would still substantial step compared we've seen last couple months. said need batch testing. guy said are. said that's enough. That's move goal posts. Good day. certainly help too, although 100%. 99% effective vaccine country 300 million people still mean 3 million people get infected.   Yeah think it.

First masks bad, good, anything N95 bad, cloth masks good, large gatherings bad, fine right cause, they're bad again, travel bans work, need them, vaccines get back normal, wear mask anyway, fully vaccinated still protected months, ect

Too often vaccine framed ""we right wrong"" help anyone. people want get shots without judged waited long. Please kind them. goalposts now?  vegetables* nobody anywhere suggested making crime vaccinated. inconvenient person nobody put jail it. People still choice always. draw line.
Now jobs, airlines, hotels, cruise ships, concert venues, non grocery shopping establsiments, dine establsiments want restrict access people vaccine board that. Still people choice. alternative inconvenient. anyone information getting Pfizer shot/booster getting JnJ? Thank you! Nah. Thank you! I'm wishing continued good health well. weird, went get tested morning KNOWING head would negative minor infection whatever imagine surprise came back positive. something little different felt woke knew go work get test.

Seriously, US gov making rain quite while. could go unemployment LOA, least state, collect afraid work. That's new - stamped comirnaty vaccine passport two months ago well.     would said “yeah, like going gym weakens body!” would think would percentage peds doctors would it. all, national group pediatricians sent FDA letter telling need approve 5-11 ASAP school starting back. Im sure cracked eventually, best bet probably try find one soon that's looking for.   one people reasoned getting wasn’t FDA approved (other emergency use).

But... Comirnaty? giants fallen... Yes, documented cases spreading one vaccinated person another. Vaccinated individuals also 65% less likely unvaccinated individuals infect someone else, although estimate based small sample size.

Another caveat mention pre-print, gone peer review bet Heaven mask mandate. sister pregnant didn’t want get first trimester unfortunately setback (non-covid related confirmed) reason not.

The two actually “don't force get camp, try force dig in”, recent unvaxxed case close nearly ended death give wake call. Sad came that, again, try live compassion understanding. I’m glad able make decision did.   sure. think report read. I’m due booster November. think concrete information next month so.  terrible person?  fact federal courts already ruled way past?  Inb4 pro-covids start calling commynaty. Brazil. Brazil already gave full approval Pfizer though (like U.S now)  I'm sick asked treat anti-vaxxers like toddlers eat vegetables. fucking adults, job sweet-talk taking basic precautions pandemic that's killed millions people. want die save pride, that's problem.  That's fucking offensive. ""Introducing Virus MurderRapeDestruction Pokey-Stab""  Depending live, COVID vaccines, treatments, tests used Emergency Use Authorization FDA whatever health agency allows use full approval. EUA drugs vaccines still go rigorous review process yet approved. Pfizer's vaccine made jump EUA get whatever vaccine available signed for. far know pulling EUA vaccines. Much better environment, too. many local Catholic dioceses issuing contradictory guidance. interesting see unfolds states mandates continue see increasing cases school aged children. even think that's true. vaccine easy answer get even still rejected many. think want delusions facts. ain't within 2 metres him. mean lot people.

I kid. fine.   Fairly blatant narrative-pumping NYT. 

Workers ""can't wait get back cubicle"" small minority, experience, even absence deadly global pandemic. Surely better strategy would NYT provide evidence publish instead reposting CIA propaganda every time. Yes, good point! forgot weight percent population vaccinated/not vaccinated well.  could also ask different doctor? Get second opinion? Moderna better marketing department, light years. let's forget ""leading authority"" made significant missteps since genesis global health crisis, including neglecting declare pandemic far long. need pardon take say grain salt. great day!  Heres example US government. Dr. Fauci begining pandemic advised masks. reasoning one science reasoning told task force meetings serious problem lack PPEs masks health providers putting harm's way every day take care sick people."" sounds noble, outright lied effectiveness masks this. reason walking around mask."" clear Fauci lied buy available N95 masks doctors. could seen nobel cause, lie nonetheless. new research, changed mask policy, many pushing masks government was. 

Heres simple solution government could done. could said ""please donate N95 masks local hospitals, please wear reusable face covering public"".

This clear story shows government problem lying create narritive wants create. transparency us government. say whatever best interest, individuals best interest. Yeah that's fine, din't think anyone telling bin mask. respond comment saying unvaccinated dying, never say exclusively dying, given make vast majority deaths fair wording.   Hmm, think might correct actually, wonder got information.    ol concern troll move. I’ve heard “It approved fast”
And also funnily enough “if safe, why’d take long approve it?” Company work gave staff September 10(?) get vaccinated aren’t, letter md letter religion vaccine said religion. can’t produce document sent home two weeks pay point said employee isn’t vaccinated produce “approved” letter, terminated. let guess, got called fearmongerer too. yes? Okay. change point all.

If they're 80% vaccinated 20% population vaccinated yet make 50% cases hospitalizations. That's disproportionate.

The half hospitalizations within vaccinated people **with preexisting cardiovascular illnesses**.

If everyone vaccinated spread lessened across board, frees medical professionals important health infrastructure need it. sounds good us, people vaccine hesitant, something ""vax"" name probably easier sell. hits hard…  seen anything maybe (or someone else reading this) know: got J&amp;J (it city could get got it, judge me), get one others booster? see promotion vaccination government overreach, wrong party. tin-foil hats running show now. meant form identification.  employees can't wait return cubicles

News business factory, business factory doubt people refuse get vaccinated believe conspiracies idiots, forcibly vaccinating people opens nasty worms. Everyone free decide want lives matter stupid perceive decision be. waiting for, tested positive morning unfortunately.   HELL YEAH BABY, GET SHOT, TAKING NEEDLE ARM SAVE LIVES EVERYONE AROUND MANLIEST SHIT POSSIBLE, WOOOOOO   Yeah let others mutate virus give unknowingly people overwhelm healthcare system. It’s right so.  teh Loominarty!!1  like choice 

""Hey folks, ya know vaccine forced peoples bodies past year, will? Well approving it."" 

Ya, option They’re moving goalposts, they’re talking sides mouth, like usual. really conspiracy, company founded \~10 years ago purpose develop therapies based time new technique: mrna.

It's transparent gets, time founding name even stylized ModeRNA. that. [The unvaccinated provide best way variants thus leading variants affect vaccinated people put hospitals. no, ""just let get infected die want vaccine"". They're dying they're taking us them.  possible I'm sure probable. Wouldn’t harm viewership!? Ehr mergerd. verxine herlp ehr comirnaty. moreso pain ass opinion.
If someone wants go game, go restaurant movie week, needs several tests, eventually they'll say fuck get shot.

Hopefully anyway don’t think that’s reason celebrate. think it’s awful come this. 

I 10,000% pro vaccine slippery slope.

We right side government time. 

This time. According to?   people never get flu shot, never get flu either (although perhaps asymptomatic). They're used yearly vaccines. they've already covid home get it, bad symptoms, convice people need it?

I'm young, i'm also one people get flu shot yearly, parents too. I've never heard anyone say *that* terrible selfish thing, anti-vax this. it? grandma deny us coming thanksgiving even though vaccinate flu lol. anti-vax applied people give kids theirselves *any* vaccines.

Masks another thing never common sense US. remember seeing lady store covid wearing one flu recently, thought really awesome considerate! first time I'd ever really thought them.

It's weird people act like common sense always been, hasn't? I'm advocating vaccines, parents want based experiences I'm sure right choice really, see convincing there's something could i'd like hear it. “another group”.  Context matters.  No, big boy nobody make eat vegetables get vaccinations anymore.

[Typical anti-vax    Antivax negotiating position: Art Deal best. Probably wait millions people receive huh took non approved drug back then? gangsta  Great call! longer wait, stronger immunity may be.

You also aren’t messing stats CDC various state governments. attenuated virus vaccines elicit bodies natural response recognise proteins whole body virus spike protein unstable coronaviruses evolve change (see lambda variant). old tech relying bodies natural response - that’s stopped polio. myocarditis caused ~~vaccine~~virus

FTFY... virus causes myocarditis, vaccine. thing along? missed it?? Clearly lol employer email blasted us mandatory number employees practically facets business. Basically interface human it’s requirement. excited discuss managers response communism meme… 

Help!  evidence outdoor transmission delta fleeting contact Stop sounding like siblings... went back college coastal Virginia we’re required wear masks, ZERO social distancing. Like lawns cafeterias packed full kids even wearing masks properly. area responsible almost 30% Virginia’s cases city particular looking good. work COVID unit hospital minutes away school I’m scared we’re get hit even harder already are. Anyone else similar experiences? 2008 retirement assets crashed. 


At moment assets homes super high. Lack societal trust core serious problems. media contributor primary cause - simply identified money making model exploiting it.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*   actually know x doctors

Actually heard last treatment lol choose flair app. would like know Cult Ice Cream. I've seen multiple anecdotal reports contain two significant close contact entire day multiple days row never infected.

Just observation random hypothesis:

 - viral shedding seems follow lopsided bell curve course infection.

 - know antibody levels bloodstream drop time vaccination, retain blueprint (in immune memory B cells) make medium-short notice (a days) antigen resurfaces.

Is extended close contact giving head start antibody production ramp first close contact shedding peak? mom hospital? Hah! pregnant pause ""What took long?"" guest reevaluate stupid hosts are. True story, cousin drowned ever since I've drank nothing diet Pepsi. I've office (at medical setting) since February. long people mask up, well-protected. That's we've seen across clinics, treat covid positive patients. may want wait 8 months. went early I'm immunosuppressant. 

Of COVID inpatients, 70% unvaccinated, 18% vaccinated severely immune suppressed, 12% vaccinated high risk co-morbities.

If immune suppressed high risk co-morbities, mask protect others. highly unlikely end hospital. Thanks!  chance source shows longer wait better? know means. click youtube link. South Park clip something? Yeah, heard back apparent gibberish names lot products means avoiding legal headache.  
One issues can't sound like another established product else accused trying confuse customers. holds true everywhere sell drug, meaning lots different languages. 
So see new product named Xyzelex something think sounds like nonsense, that's point. want sound like product English *any language earth*. 
I even think matter FDA approval. Like, think call whatever want worry future lawsuits. Ideas top head (with evidence):

* testing Israel shows accurate case count elsewhere
* Israelis relaxed hygiene regimen sooner longer, resumed effectively
* population density still going finish phase 3? Washington DC great data vaccines holding Delta, great job!  

In last 7 days, Vaccinated people account 14% cases, account 60% population.  (There serious disagreement data sources much Washington DC actually fully vaccinated)  

In past seven days, one fully vaccinated person hospitalized (or 1.5% hospitalizations).  

Unfortunately, J&amp;J recipients make disproportionate amount breakthrough cases, making 15% breakthrough cases even though makes 8% vaccines administered. literally joking around doctors name. pronounced Co Meer Natty ( think, mean, Oklahoma, say anything correctly here? )... jokingly already started saying Austin Powers type voice ""Come here, Naughty!""

I know dumb, line work days, even slightest bit humor helps day go by.   I’m going scientists. world bonkers, can't tell someone sarcastic serious anymore. -____- Wooooohooooo! Apparently, booster either company. Exactly. One less infected person today could mean dozens fewer infected people next week. adds up.   Sounds like republican paradise ways protest without risking lives thousands. Sell novavax stock. something want happen brain avoidable.

Also explains lot ones seem live delusional state, disconnected reality. get infected, survive, seem even anti-vax. old people Japan healthy old people countries? old people group Japan group almost already vaccinated. accurate total numbers first wave China, based serological testing. Around half million people infected (about 5x recorded number, similar ratio countries early on, PCR testing limited).

The total death count turned pretty accurate, based studies excess pneumonia deaths. Exactly. understand people see this. bashing pre-determining think 'the others' react helping position, encouraging get vaccinated goal.  hear goalposts moving already! question. NPR talking regards boosters, wondering like 9-11 year olds, particularly higher risk kids. theory yes, get Congress approve it. I'm super-familiar budget reconciliation rules, suspect would require least 60 senators (50 Democrats + 10 Republicans) agree. case, unlikely happen. Nah. think Pfizer asked Elon Musk he's going name second child stole it. Way easier process. College kids love Comirnaty Light trying say Sean Penn two delicious chicken patty simulacra? Citations? study discussed above. We've gotten better tech. personally like put document screen highlight it, etc., basically hold court's/counsel's attention better paper doc big signboard ever could. anything learn. stop pretending control planet.  study determine study? yet 1/3 Americans still get 😒 odd bet officers go duty without bullet proof vest... feel like maybe understand commonly used phrase ""double down"" means.   say, I’m actively looking position. 

I hope everybody is. Fuck place.  underrated comment. Thank fir argument. using on! FDA: Information yet available potential long-term health outcomes. Nothing vaccination rate mentioned. “Two things infinite, far know – universe human stupidity.” Today know statement quite correct. Einstein proved universe limited. vaccine Armenian? start acting like new vaccine give anti vax people chance say they're big fans without admitting wrong.

It's like saw interviews random people Republican counties big fans ACA hated Obamacare. Rothman, China specialist Matthews Asia, views growth reversal blip along road leading China eventually becoming world’s largest economy. recent U.S. results “like getting excited Washington Nationals winning five row they’re still five games .500,” said. Ahhh okay, thank you. 


Yeah I'm good, people think conspiracy fear mongering.. grinds gears.


Edit: Propaganda fear mongering. Well job said vax get out. choice people would fine FDA approved one vaccines October give Trump pre-election miracle. Damn Comirnists! I'd think she'd recognize signs menopause though That’s side effect. Considering quarters aren’t magnetic I’m assume vaccination site developed substantial gravitational vortex, researched. care every wave. new wave creates new risk. seen viral load transmission still high vaccinated people. want go back office :( Urkel Grue European American countries act March - heard China saying - eg locking Cities stopping travel - January Feb act. China blame countries issues That's great terms everyone might get cancer eventually, need intentionally spreading lethal infectious diseases around. gestapo virus

/S university requiring masking, social distancing. required attend multiple events many others auditorium. sure comfortable large group people room. think OK? Nah better calling iPhones Foxconn phones /s I've already heard "" ... 10 year assessments...""

What? Anyone talking motivations others, especially off-the-cuff remarks, comradary like-minded friends internet anons, venting whatever, making people fence dig stance. make part problem.

Pragmatism get us across finish line, means setting differences aside. Tozin's Comet also buys time better treatment options develop. ignore it, probably bot ""If look data Florida, cases day day coming every age category **except children age 18 seeing outbreaks schools driving infections.""**

:( Thank you.  causes spread less

It causes less likely contract first place

What ""prevent"" mean you?  getting worse. sorry, man idiot. I’m curious company will. we’re clinical trial research company many sort science background large majority already vaccinated.  since pandemic we’re almost completely remote lan stay way. people need office consistency basis. owner sent many email promoting getting vaccinated. wonder it’s worth headache mandate given we’re working remote. guess could mandate office German company. Totally, believe even thing required get eat restaurant 95% idiots would folded gotten shot. never science. desperately wanting feel smarter everyone. second becomes inconvenient them, it’s worth anymore. Pathetic. one biggest sticking points Conservatives regarding vaccine hesitancy. finally reached FDA approval, comfortable getting vaccine. 

Right? thought flippant..
 

Holy crap stupid. came covfefe, leaving satisfied Yeah, know turns reptilian? second cousin former acquaintance trying local zoo injected!  assume idiots :) Kinda like idiots wear mask driving alone car windows rolled up. 

It turns common sense isn’t actually common. J&amp;J Ihadababyitsaboy Probably whenever they’re forced drive office meeting could’ve email. - science adjust new info comes in, mean conclusions moment uncertain. KNOW gravity exists, uncertainty statement Nationalizing healthcare pretty easy solution dealing Remember: COVID-19 disease, virus. purpose vaccine prevent COVID-19 disease resulting hospitalization death. Please understand vaccine prevents virus getting body infecting you. Breakthrough infections always expected, doesn’t mean vaccines don’t work. negotiate terrorists

Unless voters, can't inconvenience them, tehee Reminds Comintern (Communist International). One less excuse anti-vaxxers. Hopefully change people's minds.  know people waiting FDA approval also aren’t anti-vax. Waiting official approval, done good intentions, shouldn’t taboo thing do. Hey! Joey Jo Jo! even accepting shit? offer any.  work TJX home office (TJMaxx, Homegoods, Marshall’s, etc) mandating us well. home office employees required fully vaccinated November 1 cannot step foot office they’re vaxxed. November 1….well nobody explicitly stated happen it’s obvious 

Everyone company, far know, thrilled. month ago survey go end 90% employees already fully vaxxed! I’m sure number lot higher continue go FDA approval. exciting! love living liberal state I've read home tests, sounds like engineered much, much likely get false positive false negative. negative PCR addition seems pretty conclusive me.  lot young people. know bunch. They’re complete idiots wouldn’t call anti vax. really don’t want bothered. They’ll get choice they’re job mandates Great idea.... 7,250 pound bouncer may hard find.    bad automod. ""purely political"" lmfao. no. got vaccinated first day could sign since I'm essential worker.

I thought ""You know, even vaccine ~6 months testing behind it, I'm willing take risk protect people around me. Like, grandfather went survived Japanese POW camp protect country, I'm gonna chicken getting fucking shot.""  Maybe make people feel comfortable. Vaccine new, new scary, that? We'll name something contrived, awkward, unpronounceable, ridiculous... like drugs treatments coming days. Presto, familiar comfortable. Someone another thread made good point could nice ""off-ramp"" people using excuse, want admit wrong along, need way safe feel like idiot/like waste time fights friends family. get vaccinated still feel like smarter everyone else waited ""100% safe"". that's takes it. problem trying make predictions there's really telling thing going do. delta wave got high Scotland (though vaccination rate high right terms hospitals/deaths), peaked started fall. thought great news, month two dropping suddenly spiked looks like going even higher. Data suggests age groups (15-24) areas last two waves. hard tell going do.  weirdos  Yeah, wish would stop calling breakthrough cases. calling feel like made sound like something rare actually is.  Real misanthropy hours. Why? still spread even though people vaccinated lmao guess dont want people dying lol   beginning fill China 2019

Even leaked documents published New York Times confirm one knew existence novel pneumonia late December. COVID-19 mimics many common respiratory diseases seronegative pneumonia way common think. cluster cases emerged clearly linked single location, wet market, people started looking closely. Also big farma, etc etc I’m guessing sarcasm - yeah it’s mind boggling right? well lot reasons, state hospitals overwhelmed anti-vaxxers beds. let's say get sort accident require form care, care may delayed postponed, etc.

This position also ignore fact still many children can't receive vaccine insignificant number immunosuppressed people put lives hold irresponsible anti-vaxxers hold society hostage.

It's actually difficult figure think seconds.  Maybe I'm misunderstanding you, afaik legal precedent set century ago Jacobson vs Massachusetts said legal mandate vaccines. Nothing laws created FDA later concept EUA impacted that. sociopolitical hot topic places want touch.

This approval (eventually) lead changes regard able sue Pfizer/Biontech, mandating vaccines order keep people safe one another businesses communities nothing legally changed (Outside military - see 10USC1107 10USC1107A).

(Of course recognize fear money-draining, baseless litigation real serious problem clear that's point made.) paragraph. clarify like 12 15 paragraphs down. people stopped reading point CNN know better. Yeah I’ve already heard “Well obviously rushed through” do?

In experience harass medical staff

And isn’t Covid. I’d say good 15% patients basically refusing medical care. Like fuck even don’t want help? It’s annoying wear one every day, day work March 2020 January 2021, took early retirement. Maybe matter getting used due constant use?

I could see annoying wear one minutes there, get chance adapt face would *aware* time.

I've worn one much often forget one leaving store something. first dropped mask mandate here, actually felt exposed uncomfortable without it, went back wearing one CDC recommended again. here, felt like shit next day bur approximately zero blood clots COVIDs.  Amazing. Would hilarious implications dire cus people inherently risk adverse effects actions taken amplified taking actions.   cool sounds like Energy drink lmao  probably talking Israel.

Did know Israel half country's 600 severely ill covid patients vaccinated two doses also elderly chronic illnesses (heart disease, lung problems, cancer)? half vaccine. 

This Isreal giving boosters elderly right now.   get mandate!

You get mandate!

Every Body Gets Mandate! dont know guess info copied new card. heard stories people got second card second shot. first shot info copied over. Depending state may able get offical records depending needed for. Someone know died last week polluted Alex Jones conspiracy crap highly doubt state laws overturned courts. leads believe be? Governor DeWine Ohio pro-vax he’s actively pushing it. He’s taken pandemic seriously. (Not everything perfectly, stands peers.) think would believe won’t get it’ll like cold. adverse reactions noted; reported adverse reactions relatively minor transient.

Your source disagrees you. mean, makes sense. fault putting damn uppercase N middle word.   Small problem?!? still answer humidity question..
Or threadcount question. guess ask study scientists directly want something similar state hasn’t implemented this, try ImmunaBand. creates wrist band QR code points CDC card backed PIN (that give person scanning code). one; love it. wonder health insurance employer liability impacted, presumably even someone teleworking contracts COVID community-the insurer still hook looking ways pay lengthy hospitalizations. That's impossible countries healthcare system public digitized.  Yeah, he’s great charity work sure. took years get much data polio vaccines they’re actually significantly dangerous disease prevents caused less deaths US Covid. Oral polio vaccines cause roughly three cases vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis per million doses given. Pfizer’s vaccine paralyzed zero children. 1952 United States severe polio outbreak - 58,000 cases. Polio paralyses 5000 people per million infections. mortality rate 2-5% among children. 

Far less people dying polio vaccine actually slightly dangerous.    hope sister minority reluctant.

I'm afraid be, many people staked identity vaccine skepticism. People rarely willing admit wrong, instead look excuse (""It rushed! political! Can't trust FDA!"") continue hold beliefs. matter want. literally ""Please save lives. Even think invincible, others aren't.""   mean ""every developed nation"" exactly? nation universal healthcare different setup. talking UK? Germany? Singapore? They're different.

And yet two things common: form universal healthcare price system efficient cost effective per capita level fact, many developed nations mentioned still private health insurance companies!

Try ask again. accidentally mess up, none us would want anything bad happen you.    wonder ""long haulers"" meaning weird chronic health problems get covid.   wife hospital nurse(vaccinated) correct. good want learn cause effect doctors trying accomplish. Many follow orders doctor put call doctor vitals get flagged whack. Clock shift come back next day. Maybe full authorization 12+ EUA 5-12 time Delta gets replaced worse variant? sounds cool enough alt-right accidentally get it.  think so. (Although I’d probably finish moderna since you’ve already got half it) Uh oh…. Maybe start beginning. someone else said that’s pretty much criminal acts. Like go general court martial everything they’re less treated felonies. 

I don’t think felony refuse one. I’ve problem military requiring part every vaccine that’s used maintain force readiness. refuse those, it’s DD, separation.  Say Jimmy Carr's already form vaccine passport company, even worse. whoever named NBC’s steaming service must naming   like 60 years actually, recently we've obtained tools make use research effectively probably ask doctor wait recommended time.  someone explain liability protection thing? I’m reading lot comments elsewhere folks still don’t want get vaccinated companies aren’t held liable side effects? 

While I’m fully vaxxed, seem kinda fucked wouldn’t held responsible. Soreness, redness fatigue pretty minor side effects ask me. SpikeVax 2077 We're...we're gonna call that.  “FDA approves things US countries don’t approve!” approval stamped today, lot paperwork takes time update fully speaking removed websites Approval Letter addresses advertisement section highlighted, page 4, Pfizer submit advertisement proposals labelling FDA approval.   means shut in, clarify. Come winter though…. activities referencing? Technically speaking, considered booster. normal series immunocompromised people considered 3 shots, immunocompromised people supposed getting 3rd shot, even late. 

&amp;#x200B;

But certain immunocompromised people already qualified 3rd shots this. full authorization 16+, even qualify specific standards, doctors would give third shot off-label someone immunocompromise full approval I've read. mean get Pfizer shot received Moderna? Good sticking word!! Fucking amazing. anti-vaxxers?

Also, Moderna second approval? Can't mandate without FDA approval! ... oh wait.

""Nevermind."" — Emily Litella   start list like 200 names, usually choose 5 end many unusable different reasons. names never first choice Commynasty

Breakthrough cases NJ (from Governor's Facebook August 2nd – August 9th, fully vaccinated individuals accounted for: 
➡️1,397 positive tests (Statewide Total: 7,611) 
➡️25 COVID-related hospitalizations (Statewide Total: 608) 
➡️0 COVID-related deaths (Statewide Total: 53)

So breakthrough cases exactly uncommon (18%) great preventing hospitalizations death. Nutjobs go back forth believing government agents spec ops black helicopter ninjas believing government workers completely incompetent.  earth would wait this, could've vaccinated protected months ago Well, I’m bummed. I’d GNRing it. Ignorance bliss. guess it’s true, nothing lasts forever. ""eXpERimEntAl cLoTsHoT hurr durr""

Can't wait see mental gymnastics week. Another thing keep mind speed FDA approval usually first-come-first-serve basis. multiple steps process, normal circumstances, drug go back line every step, wait turn processed through.

The covid vaccines fast-tracked, meaning jumped front line every step, cutting slow red tape normally takes place.   Legit curious mandates work out. feel thought mixed opinions vaccines, especially GOP, mandates incredibly weak achieve much.  J&amp;J lagged behind Pfizer/Moderna several months, I'm going guess Moderna approval early Sept, J&amp;J late November.

Keep mind side effects vaccine, side effects body building immunity. would imagine second part going same, regardless vaccine. 

The side effects vaccine pretty tame (soreness), common anaphylaxis response happens within minutes (which hang 15 minutes shot). happens 2-5 people per million. treated quickly easily poses real danger.

If female 50 there's super rare Thrombosis chance (42 total cases, 0.0003% chance). male 50 there's super rare chance Guillain-Barre (most people recover it, there's chance nerve damage). 161 preliminary reports (0.0012% chance). confirmed reports death due vaccine, small chance underlying health condition could make worse (0.0019% people died post-vaccination probably vaccination related, need research). [Data somewhere around 0.0035% chance something bad could happen (that assumes worst case above). Using today's US average 0.0003% chance dying covid DAILY. means statistically, chance something bad happening due vaccine chance contracting Covid next 12 days dying it. likely contract Covid tomorrow adverse reaction vaccines.

AND, let's forget gradient contracting Covid dying. significant long-term effects Covid infection. 

As result body building immunity, rough. 85+% people know shot maybe experienced lethargy. I, personally, hit pretty hard:

12 hours second shot became super tired. started running fever trouble sleeping. whole next day super run-down achey. 48 hours later still tired feeling better. took full 3 days felt normal again. would equate bad cold without congestion/coughing.  misunderstand me, I'm saying apocalypse movie. saying time tons people dying know going happen, weird anyone would want put situation know situation going 9 months need doctor. Yes, TRUE!!! 

I direct first hand knowledge, exact number that's I'm saying hundreds hundreds, easily could thousands, geographic region. 

If believe I'm saying that's fine. people think masks work, people believe bacteria, viruses real, people believe vaccines work, people believe world globe. terk er jerbs! destreryn er comirnaty! r0 flu dropping one regions seasonality different r0 covid dropping one wave peaks. ""simple mathematical fact"" pandemics over. vast majority die merely wane disease burden cross fuzzy threshold endemic.  feel you, man. snow here, there's typhoon commute work hell, mention daily heavy traffic. can't understand people would wanna go back, friends/coworkers say miss interactions.

Ad hoc pronunciation guides carry death penalty   Let make different point. N95s promoted goal providing everyone protection vaccine available. ever goal never promoted, despite N95s readily available public September last year.

By September pretty deep mask mandates general though, CDC onboard since April 3rd. beef N95s best guess based solid data. made recommendation without sufficient data based felt public would tolerate. much reasoning Fauci suggested follows. fair public. cautious recommendation preference limited data available.

Agreed, though really data then. agree point generally cautious scenario again, pretty severe shortage yet we've known better regarding viruses century. chose prefer convenience time rather reasoned recommendation based data.

I think convenience pretty loaded word here. I'm hard time understanding brushing away supply situation like completely irrelevant seems pretty integral understanding context decisions. fully agree

Seems like recipe unvaccinated people coming work positive. anything remotely sounds like pushing. Honestly I'd say nothing, like something slips mind hear about. exactly counts long covid clearly spectrum disorder.  still effective everyone however. Lots break cases reported mRNA covid-19 vaccines. Also people heart problems receiving even one shot. Yet one willing talk this, what's keeping getting it. info getting 6 months vs 8 months? two weeks way 6 months return office major city would feel much better 3rd dose. want 8 months truly markedly better.    would mean work him. vaccine well 99% effective preventing death anyone died covid recieving vaccine?

Yes, 100% effective. likely severe comorbidities immunocompromised. few, any, vaccinated healthy people dying COVID. That's pretty big disingenuous leap ""don't sneeze people"" wanting pandemic last forever. get what's going head whole point wearing mask catch sneezes, coughs, etc.  know.

Seems like standard reddit/Twitter response tbh We've lived COVID 18 months. pretty good idea long term impact (aka, none near matters).

Kids shrug off. country right since beginning. may swayed also collecting paycheck production Sean Penn working on. producers hire people vaccinated rather not. Totally possible since it’s also vascular: I'm long-time advocate universal healthcare, given we're far ideal US, say let market take care let hammer fall who've freeloading hospital system refusing vaccine. majority who've paid vaccine ""taxes"" stuck ever-mounting hospital bills covidiots? We're talking quick 2 4 day stay. They're hospital literally WEEKS. I'd fine tacking $20k surcharge anyone winds ER covid needs admitted vaxxed up. Walmart already required everyone salaried position get vaccinated, employees nationwide register vaccination status September 3rd. vaccines getting full approval, would shocked Walmart require everyone get vaccinated end year.    “You really trust FDA tell us truth?” Get Strawberry Blast! tried flavors weekend one made lose consciousness. move, covid. /s Except vitamins FDA approved people take shit time. smart, another country US people can't complain.   both. Shhhhh! lmfao new narrative? FDA approve copium?  Yeah nevermind he's like Nebraska anyways lol  You’ll likely fine think bigger issue, extends far beyond one company, easily vaccination cards faked.  could start loud, vocal obvious public shaming anivaxxers literally got booster SpikeVax Publix  bad don’t actually protect Likely similar Complera (an HIV drug) approvable effect lawsuits, someone takes vaccine heart problems (yes, know rare) dies, mean families now?     Covishield 3000 Platinum Master Pro  article stating legal ACA? Pre-existing conditions certainly can't reason insurance cost, specific items like smoking could.

In event, employers also usually give incentives healthy behaviors, I'm sure vaccination status wanted to. There’s free widely available vaccine still protects extremely well hospitalization death leaving overwhelming majority infected none mild symptoms, know right?

It’s like people want pandemic last forever. It’s mix COVID, community, mRNA, immunity People live internet politics don’t seem understand average person doesn’t keep like 99% stuff.  No, eventually stops ""novel"" get exposed either via vaccine virus. bodies likely eventually learn recognize fight better encountered.

Hopefully, actually find better treatments well effectively fight whose bodies lose ability fight off, whatever reason.

It's going go lot better body ""learns"" via vaccine, tho Pfizer vaccine around longer moderna?

The bleed work personal life ha increased bit trade dressing comfortably, commute, obnoxious people yapping around worth it.

Also, live northeast prior covid allowed work remotely weather really bad snow could use leave time stay home real waste day. work waste it. Exactly. I’ve fatigue soreness flu shot before. would classify mild especially considering sick people get actually infected flu. certainly would deter getting again. deter others. 

Another rationale see among patients “I don’t get flu shot never get flu.” Um, what? love comment. wife's entire side family adamantly refused vaccine (except wife encouraged get vaccine knows trusts would never encourage anything believed put kind danger).

Wife's mom positive Covid test Tuesday. Due recent messy divorce, living wife's grandparents (her parents, obviously).

Well, wife's old grandpa every medical condition could imagine (overweight, cancer, uncontrolled diabetes, lyme disease, Agent Orange poisoning, bunch shrapnel still body Vietnam, I'm probably missing conditions) caught Covid her. vaccinated trust anything government says experiences Vietnam, hard time trusting Doctors myriad bad experiences dealing VA. wish ""I work STEM, trust them, least trust me"" conversation worked, didn't. tried reminding he's 70s million diseases really rational cause worry long-term effects, appeal work either.
