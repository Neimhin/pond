you're buying anything w/o vaccinations.

even then.. 806 people infected Delta variant ended hospital England 1 February 14 June 2021: 
527 (65%) people unvaccinated 
135 (17%) 21 days first dose vaccine 
**84 (10%) 14 days second dose**

 
As 14 June, 73 deaths England people confirmed Delta variant died within 28 days positive test, these: 
34 (47%) unvaccinated 
10 (14%) 21 days first dose vaccine 
**26 (36%) 14 days second dose** wow that's bit time! Thanks. think people Gov keeps messing up, everyone is...just it, that's take see anyway. current mess.

Google ""Pfizer graph"" look images. Protection date first dose pretty great. it? judge said employees hospital system like requirement, could go work elsewhere.

&amp;#x200B;

Pretty good argument. That'd require changing ACA that. sets floor insurance coverage one requirements every insurance plan pay hospitalizations. Even could it'd stop insurance companies paying treatment, forcing hospitals foot bill instead later try collect patient (if survive) they'd still required treat whether insurance covers not.

Another option would make reason increase healthcare plan costs--if vaccinated COVID insurance plan might cost 30% example. That'd also require changing ACA might least get couple votes (not close 60 votes Senate it'd need pass though). downside approach it'd penalize people can't get vaccinated due real health condition. try carve exception I'm sure unscrupulous doctors would sign whoever want get vaccinated they're penalized.

Either way going happen. 'justice' unvaccinated people put extreme risk awful way go out. That's enough punishment IMO. Balloon festival? people want vaccine fine consequences them. We're moving society. Reporting Oregon again. 40k shots left go reopen. 1k administered today. Next week state continental US reopened yet. Trust science guess! Thank response. 

Am already fully vaccinated since April. doctor advise stoppage MTX vaccination. really say much else except continue masking like unvaccinated seemed pissed asking. advise antibody testing booster doses although plan getting 3rd dose offered. Since current medications seem working particularly well Crohn's due results recent colonoscopy may longer MTX soon. Yes, sure that’s relevant though.  every adult could get vaccinated did, immunocompromised people would also protected. US? Something like 90% ""nearly.""

And context many experts people here, pushed actual 100%. 

It always lying people. vaccines really rely good, lying gives dumb anti-vaxxers ammunition.  
In Romania, don’t even get car get vaccinated 
24-hour Pifzer vaccination marathons also popular. 
However, everyone vaccinated Romania. know someone traveled vaccinator didn’t vaccinate Pfizer already received another vaccine previous four weeks. Caution accidental: currently comprehensive studies effects vaccination vaccine mixing. case, already countries used: Bahrain, example , nearly 60 percent vaccinated received Sinopharm, Pfizer given third dose previously vaccinated Chinese vaccine. According Bahraini protocol, six months elapse second Sinopharm Pfizer. 
Dual nationals also vaccinated border 
Hungarian-Romanian dual citizens receive Janssen vaccine, example, Nagylaki border post, presenting Romanian identity card. also beneficial single dose Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine enough, meaning choose solution travel twice vaccination. 
Not EESC

Nevertheless, offered someone antibodies two vaccinations, would tested free Semmelweis University, extent capacity, special test. However, rector say negative result examination, case retired doctor, wrote following article:

Sorry, comes bit harsh, live Europe exemption get medical reason. I.e. proven record complications specific type vaccines. whole exemption religious reasons make sense me. Why? It’s exact right people dying. lied number enough test much cherry picking data months Delta UK.

Huh? UK like 99% delta according current sequencing.

This data effectiveness specifically Delta look Friday 80 got hospitalized 800 double dose vaccinated.

Not everyone catches virus would hospitalised without vaccine. around \~2-15% would hospitalised depending demographics country.

And vaccine also stops large % even CATCHING virus.

So stops 50% people catching covid, 15% hopitalised vaccines 92% effective 0.6% people catch covid would hospitalised.

Lower flu.... wonder slightly lower effectiveness AZ jab hospitalisation people higher age brackets potentially vulnerable given jab. Hopefully soon resolved, Europe bunch factories opened retrofitted produce Pfizer, hang there...

The issue causes low vaccination rate also responsible USs exceptionally poor handling containment pre vaccination frankly responsible deaths tens thousands Americans, many would gladly vaccinated follow rules (such where).

But dude, microchip would provide safety all? people would get chip would work better? Would pretty irresponsible refuse get chip right? Also replace word ""chip"" anything would like. Vaccine, surgery prosthetic. social credit system China could also comparable. credit system provides certain level safety works people use it. really big fan dictatorial rules especially fan bootlickers sacrifice anything safe.

I’m holding Delta 4K Per Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) used collect reports adverse events vaccination general public. primarily used identify potential topics investigate regards vaccine reactions.

But vaccines we're even willing give 90%+ population (hopefully within months whenever studies giving vaccines younger children complete). course, different viruses different R values (+ seasonal effects complicate things), firm number percentage population needs vaccinated (I seen claims low 55% COVID-19, currently looks optimistic). data coming Israel making clear vaccinating basically everyone 16 almost one 16 good enough.

Just like antivacers choice.
To Give shit bout &amp; fellow Americans. Apparently many choose freedom give fuck . vaccines recommended administered people underlying medical conditions. People HIV weakened immune systems due illnesses medication might increased risk severe COVID-19. may receive COVID-19 vaccine. People autoimmune conditions may receive COVID-19 vaccine. People previously GBS may receive COVID-19 vaccine. People previously Bell’s palsy may receive COVID-19 vaccine.

What immunocompromised groups recommended *not* get vaccine? flu vaccines, yet still flu deaths. Vaccines awesome! (I got covid one January) always deaths info map.

See UK (Table Delta variant, UK 73 deaths.

26 73 fully vaccinated that's fully vaccinated people minority time question. What’s gaping hole exactly? 11% secret service employees contracted Covid vs 10% general population? Wooooo scary! I'd imagine similar results. create similar parts spike protein, study study numbers, efficacy almost identical. recommend boosters, unless specifically find need get booster original vaccine manufacturer first received, I'll that. get whatever can, qualms getting Pfizer booster, even though got Moderna vaccine. you’re rapid test faint positive, may want get PCR test confirm. Rapid tests likely PCR swabs give false positive result. really need start getting specific indoor gatherings. There's difference another family dinner raging house party governments acknowledge that, people start tune even more. 6G spreading speed, infecting 4K every minute They’ve actually updated section since last checked yesterday lol. simply stating don’t recommend vaccine 18 section showing they’ve determined it’s safe 12 year olds context reporting quote. Yeah. I've trying get trials. I'm concerned (not worth going virtual) healthy outbreaks school last year (with masks, though). case, hopefully long school year get vaccinated. yesterday county CO vaccinated 31% 18yr +, 28% 12+. don’t feel great things given low vaccination rates here. Given one (regardless vaccine status) wearing masks anymore, think might end issues here. 

2/3 kids still years away vaccine eligibility, could get one dose Pfizer anaphylactic reaction first. one claiming kids don’t get sick.

Oh, are.  info map.

See UK (Table Delta variant, UK 73 deaths.

26 73 fully vaccinated that's fully vaccinated people minority time question. district (southwest ohio) says masks next year it’s subject change that's stuff fucked right 30% people US want get vaccinated. actually *does* matter people make stuff up. probably take time gather interpret data? way fever either mild annoyance serious/dangerous depending high gets individual person, myocarditis mild don’t even notice serious enough need treatment. info map.

Why subject immunocompromised people come every time vaccines restrictions discussed? Usually heavy implication better dare think pandemic winding ""the immunocompromised!!!"".  circle friends parents come over, they're fully vaccinated. Anyone else like repair people ask wear masks they're inside, rare. Pfizer vaccines variant? know need advice protect family contagious disease go straight an... economist. read did. prove safety point EUA lowered children.

Riiiiiiight. 

Anyway, that's even talking about. Rather pointing OP's statement missing mark. UK reported 16,135 new COVID-19 cases another 19 coronavirus-related deaths latest 24-hour period, according government highest number daily infections since 6 February 18,262 latest figures compare with 11,625 new infections 27 fatalities recorded yesterday. 9,055 cases nine deaths announced time last week Alternate link require That's figured, thanks.

Yes agreed, two shots necessary anyone previously infected natural antibodies. noticed D+? Worse/better? ah yes pandemic taught us anything effective lying public health policy America: Hold beer know one person (met years ago) died covid, three people got (mild) covid, friend friend got blood clots AZ. Well job come contact hundreds international guests everyday makes sense get it. *Bowling Alone* fascinating account. http://bowlingalone.com/ quite slow update guidance, look recommendations (and, realistic, it’s exactly interest update guidance under-18s they’re trying advocate vaccines used elsewhere, political/advocacy-oriented organization) Speaking UK, think every adult could least first vaccine able get second one couple weeks, you‘re surely right we‘re quite yet.
I hoping vaccines also greatly reduce long-term complications, although that‘s unclear.  keep hearing people saying kids effected. effected? 

Yep. Hospitalization death rare, increasingly frequent variants.  may concerning pediatric long Covid.  
There 10 clinics US specialize treating long Covid pediatric patients. ( Annecdotally 11 year old nephew 6 months variety long Covid symptoms still hasn’t fully recovered. )

  
Data still easy come long Covid adults, even harder come kids. changing

  
“In adults, studies peg proportion experience prolonged difficulties 1 3 Covid patients, vanishingly small set stats children. Experts told STAT they’ve looked one research paper Rome studied 129 patients 2 18 years old, well data 9,000 children adolescents U.K.’s health system. small base, surmise plausible range 7% 20%.

&amp;#x200B;

With new hearing loss brain damage symptoms tracking “mild”/non-hospitalized Covid cases... Covid remains absolutely nothing want play around with. may effect, addicted sucking cigarettes/vapes like child addicted sucking soother/pacifier.

It's one reasons gum used help replace habit right? Occupies mouth place cigarette. 

The habit addicting substance. People love routine. Yea know COVID also cause inflammation kind lose lose situation least vaccines protect alot COVID effects. job pretty physical nature, I'm 31 I'm glad got vaccine also hoping many effects come it. Way go, Vermont . Cancer patient chemo . It’s annoying can’t go anymore adl . Like meaningless priority shit talk America? I'm saying bad leadership sole reason this, sure big one. Biden goes TV says resign vaccines hit 95% adult population Trump retake office. might work. thought Pfizer reported testing safety efficacy trials won’t need positive cases order complete. American. countries universal healthcare tax dollars pay antivax hospital bills. I'm universal healthcare feel like people opted out. wave specific areas, mostly areas low vaccination rates. feel like future virus (surges localized specific regions). LA County Public Health Director recently called COVID-19 “pandemic amongst unvaccinated”. Get shots people! Fauci Know Everything still give Darwin Awards? whose fault 16B doses high efficacy vaccines ready immunize world? one's. agree author idiot utterly lacking appreciation reality. Ivory tower syndrome?

I know could done practical matter, vax doses would certainly stretch already possessing natural immunity could identified moved end line. There's every possibility may even benefit vaccination. saying fact -- valid possibility. know sure yet.

If there's thing silver lining concerning refusers, would allocations sent help cover need want it. real effort get expiring stock arms thrown away. Over-purchase sin -- wastage is.   vaccine works 95% protection infection 95% protection severe illness. (or whatever exact percentage is, know top head. JJ lower)

So even get vaccine happen one super small percentage people get it....that mean vaccine work.

No vaccine Personally, expect vaccines perfect, I've seen long-term health consequences viruses, want family. So, care new variants.

Why afraid new variants vaccines protect it?

How many vaccinated people getting long term health consequences coronavirus vaccinated? 

How many vaccinated people getting long term health consequences new variants coronavirus vaccinated? 

This mean ""You also get shut everything want to.""

Just scared mean fear justified statistically.

Do drive ride car?  must terrified every time much higher percentage long term health consequences vehicle crash getting long term health consequences coronavirus vaccinated. Right you, we're still keeping public spaces reasonably protect Covid. Same. I'm Illinois. school district away remote learning masking social distancing. Guess year homeschooling us. I'm furious school board, whoever made decision. got mine walking Walgreens across street appointment. Trying understand peoples view isn’t helpful? ignorant. Even tho may agree it, it’s healthy understand reasoning peoples decisions views.  Around 160,000 state prisoners TX probably $5 per prisoner per year would $800,000 year. Oh man. sure another school year mask. get hot, humid weather right October there’s AC school. 

I’ll but… ugh Yeah, Google swipe keyboard prone interesting autocorrect errors proof read properly. scientists would detect trials whether large kids age like top age group need larger dose statistically would get sick more.  way know without seeing numbers many fraudulent applications get. approved application costs government least $10,000 year lifetime applicant adds pretty quick millions applicants per year. universal basic income nonsense could avoided . Kids neuroplasticity adults, may recover better COVID-19 sure hell chance it. risk worth it. data still showing mostly testing positive young i.e. 25. 50s rate much lower, group vaccine jabs. antibiotics cleared up, would think respiratory infection caused drainage allergies. got control allergies, would happen every fall winter almost 20 years. I've seen several videos Indians held ""given"" vaccine. imagine that's government really able ""energize"" effort. No, violates 1st amendment. dangerous precedent could used sorts unpopular speech. Chile. Yes no. makes much sense. made feel ugly Yes. request remove data SRA (not updating, deleting) highly unorthodox outbreak. think huge inconvenience?

yes multitude ways. vaccines + social distancing. Frankly long COVID still spreading (which appears able among vaccinated without social distancing), it'll keep mutating till current vaccines ineffective. Without onset time 3 weeks, little selection pressure less deadly. Also, work counterfeiting w/e  Inspect vial ensure thawed within expiry integrity maintained. Note frozen vial allowed thaw refrigerator, take 3 hours. removed directly freezer, take 30 minutes room temperature.

Basically could make people wait longer get jabbed. introduces another logistic challenge. Get outside touch grass barefoot. Quit news week along social media. fear fades, thoughts return. know many people think critically, demographic intentionally increased unnatural speed? currently work hospital San Antonio, already seeing new variant, Delta, contagious spectate vaccines ain't strong (Issa joke) Yes, muco nasty. seems occur India, covid global issue. Yet muco cannot linked covid, perhaps weakened immune systems (which exactly reserved India). herpes. I'm wondering exactly link muco spread covid, ""beautiful"" children involved? Yep, got Pfizer first shot moderna second. side effects moderna shot fascinating- muscle aches woke kept awake. German chancellor replaced next day, elected parliament, people. vice chancellor anyhow. replaced everyone. Good study. things consider:

* Counties mask mandate bigger, denser places suitable virus transmission.
* Mandate imply compliance.

Even mind, impact masking clear. necessarily. may natural limit nonsense - zed plural alpha

Hitchhikers? smell still 60% since April. Spent 3 weeks post quarantine breathlessness made sit down. Healthy 25 year old   It’s not-particularly-easy, not-very-much money. I’d see last resort, first. confirm. disability while, ten years ago. $990 (Canadian) month, fairly large urban centre, go far. clue works traveling outside Germany

I actually moved Germany, tell definitively depends traveling to. able use one Germany's free testing centers travel, needed succulent English (it French Spanish) used place make appointment ahead time. think places agree required negative test. checked requirements countries, thinking transiting countries, IIRC, need test transition another country EU. think US requires test. course countries much restrictive Covid entry requirements. least increased spacing maximum intervals approved EMA (6 weeks mRNA, 12 weeks AZ). Covid death rate low. lockdown probably bigger impact population numbers reducing birthrate. They’re also incredibly unlikely even need hospital treatment strongly encouraged become vaccinated. find HR hiring current positions. Finally, invited leave.

This step one chain.  Corona virus cause loss brain tissue? Reminds reading Texas spent $1.1 million fighting two prisoners' lawsuit soap sanitizers amidst pandemic.

Curiously, 5-11 showing hump. Deaths are, thankfully, much rare, hospitalized kid still hospitalized kid... 1/3 hospitalized adolescents ICU admissions also scary. First dose made sluggish. Second dose gave fever hours second day. Well worth it. still surge, later on. same, twin 6 year olds despite fully vaccinated awesome vaccines, still mask up. solidarity. like personal obligation roll dice vaccine bring home sick (I mean, given much year remote school, feel owe get past finish line months). get wrong, fault fully vaccinated people going umasked allowed. don’t believe word guy says. Sadly lost credibility, looks like he’s trying stay relevant. knew March 2020, found patients contact market. 

There plenty studies, NIH included, suggesting much earlier timeline virus's spread, inside outside China. 

Considering dicey US-China relation been, removal valuable info US government run SRA seems extremely normal me. Bad news brits. would nyt run report questioning Pfizer vaccine effectiveness? don't, deep down. sure am. Thank you!. see wearing mask indoors forced stay within 7 local government areas weeks collectively size major US city huge loss. stay it? everything else... Gov estimates least 10 percent goes waste.

Could due lots factors.

I'm sure understand this. Hospitals always able require health precautions employees. 

You also fired refuse submit TB screening, get vaccinations, refuse wear mask situations occupational safety determines required. pandemic coming end US. Cases relatively low now, projections show 5th wave fall due delta variant. Vaccine rates US stuck around 56% (18+), except budge much, probably 60% end year. herd immunity supposed 'premium vaccine' Pfizer going Israel?  


Anyone paying attention known covid would endemic, transmissible, filling hospitals thing matters, becomes cold everyone forget about, go back lives normal. Whoever developer variants need calm down, one wants updates frequent appreciate blunt. 
And no, saying get sick bad reaction due “x” reason taking vaccine. 
She wants know kids around age autism reacted. 
She said get it, waiting data/proof/cases/ etc. 

I’m worried due new variant household likes travel outside state. would like take vaccine sooner later. 

Both kids got COVID late November last year. Thankfully symptoms. 
My ex well, like flu. boyfriend hospital. 

I get even it’s enough okay right away. 
This comment mine one step least, find info this. 

The people commenting teens adults autism reactions great welcome. clearly matter help convince ex. 
The comment contacting Pfizer data autism individuals great. would never thought that. 

My thought process “my parents got polio vaccine that’s never got it, going get COVID one”

My ex thinks differently specially due son autism. get it. also took moderna serious side affects. Everybody reacts different know. 
The comment asking feedback step many I’m taking ease ex it’s safe son take it. 

Thank help, seriously appreciate it. Cuz know it’s going another battle 11 year old turns 12 September. likely allergies. part, Dr. Worobey still wants answers. “I hope hear authors generated, deleted, crucial sequences understand motivation so,” said. “It certainly strange face value really demands explanation.” Yet many people much poorer several kids. contrary, poor people likely kids.

Because gov makes really hard get az. Even eligible. NIH released statement Wednesday saying researcher originally published genetic sequences asked removed NIH database could included different database.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  doubt largely dispelled. Masks effective. total 0 national lockdowns, that's why. restrictions put place local governors, one state downward trend, others upwards, kinda evens out. That's average death numbers ""stable"".  virus infects cats (including wild ones like lions), ferrets, ton animals. populations potential reservoir virus. long circulates nature hop unprotected human population anywhere. virus isn’t going disappear. It’s like handful known human corona viruses, like OC43 HKU1 others. 

What suppress point doesn’t millions opportunities mutate outbreaks sparse isolated. Outbreaks populations low rates vaccination still serious. case war Merkel would become Commander Chief Colleges universities offer vaccine alongside small scholarship getting them. Ok. family stays around Stone Mountain area. technically can't know alot parents 10 11yo's who're bringing kids shot regardless. need parental approval, birth certificate school ID anything (at least Cali). Summer programs huge right least upper-middle-class &amp; affluent want kids infected. Yeah, that’s happening. Actual riots would break US went lockdown combat Delta variant. Vaccinated people protected shouldn’t punished Anti-Vaxxers orange dingus’ followers refusing get vaccine. think current pandemic situation merits stricter lockdown? don’t know suggested, masks fine although don’t find they’ve made much difference point they’ve implemented pandemic. fact there's details symptom status makes fairly confident mild worst.  Canadians polite.  referring ""After year two, even best mRNA vaccine protected infection unless got another booster shot"" Sure, thougt mRNA magic bullet without faliure becaus early sucess. 

Moderna tested well still want caution thinking vaccine variant system liniear. complaining about. parents make 150,000, get job yourself, rely parents.  Moderna incredibly reliable production low  vast majority folks abide domestic coronavirus restrictions way referring long long term. sounds like something would want continue years lockdown/restrictions loosening back again? That’s terrible idea. vaccines. That’s it. Let’s get back normal.  Poland around 10 mln, including friends. picked one shot done. feel like virus thin anti-vaxxers natural selection. Right, **I'm** one making gross generalizations here. guy labeled anyone ok restrictions loser life.

God sub sucks lol. would ideal, there's practical way compel every eligible person get vaccinated. People refuse, varying reasons. pandemic eventually end anyway, even would end faster higher vaccination uptake. Vaccinated people Israel enjoying - suggesting lockdowns? Wearing mask grocery store isn’t “the world going on”. 

It complicated. big unknown long term effects. evidence Covid causing diabetes, erectile dysfunction, loss brain matter? people going serious diseases shortly road like Alzheimer’s dementia even mild illness?

I don’t get waste much energy debating masks. Anyone paying attention know plenty reasons need keep cases low. Read comment go crazy Don’t get worked upset. Cool minds prevail. work end. issue apathy. people can't arsed beyond bare minimum.

If bucks gets people get it, worth society. MVP. Without Pfizer outlook would terrible. Also Moderna deserves praise, also delivering steadily, albeit much lower rate. Trump could used advantage said it’s everyone’s patriotic duty get Vaccinated too. Got second pfizer 4/20, one relatively early ones:

We get world Covid stops problem sooner move on.

That's worth million silly trinkets. U.K. particularly bad pollen count past month. feel like greatly contribute symptoms. 

It entirely possible hay fever suddenly develop one year. thinking another shut down? really don’t feel like remote teaching again. nice home job lot harder. Pfizer Moderna capable pivot relatively easy. Astrazeneca J&amp;J problems. 

But virus mutates enough, even Pfizer Moderna much - need get anti vaxxers board, basically. nothing whatsoever anything either us said. course realize delta grow scratch UK, months India - Alpha wildtype strain it. That's every country right mind everything import VOC cases. 90-95% older people vaccinated, inevitable vaccinated people die. That's measure efficacy extremely high uptake  we've already gotten better treatments past year half... detection.. peaked yet probably getting better anytime soon... world needs go on. 

It's complicated, mild cases, people getting sick from, cure ""lockdowns"" definitely reach point dangerous disease.  Reminds im TP reference obviously yes, fully vaccinated people died Delta variant. specific Delta - true major circulating strains. 

The currently EUA two-dose mRNA viral vector vaccines highly effective 100% effective. small number fully vaccinated people (671) died US June 14th per CDC. Fuck u bot Hahahahahahah Lol Better vaccines, boosters, treatments, ventilation, detection. 

It really depends cases. they’re going up, increase precautions, they’re going down, relax some. much complicated problem people want believe. It’s never getting sort vaccine. It’s always keeping cases low. We're around 12k now. Looks like u/dawgbreath wasnt far vaccine completely effective. take 20 million elderly 96% efficacy, still leaves 800k risk. Yes, that’s huge number, 800k less likely infected vast majority rest safe. people fall cracks. ain’t air tight. They're going fun winter South.  Yukon ample supply logistics good, reached 88.5% far eligible. know representative Canada whole though.  vs 50ml Pfizer believe

Hahahaha. Could imagine right? needle would size turkey baster. shots 0.5ml 0.3ml Moderna mRNA material. Mask mandates ""lockdown"" lmao parents made much money 2019. hoping articles would address headlines haven’t. It’s weird Israel literally considering reinstitution lockdowns cases exploded 10x 1 week ago. headlines speaking gravity situation seems warrant. starting exponentially much lower amount, you’re failing realize that. actually read ""Delta plus"" article that's pretty fitting weed strain. well that's point, usually put significant figures beyond order magnitude estimated error, actual measurement 92±2%, .28 means nothing, absolutely information significant digits beyond 2 92.

Not dissing researchers, probably problem reporting (or somehow interpretation), student would get docked points lab report. end game though? virus going spread mild form fully vaccinated people, continue forever... bringing restrictions temporary fix going make real difference long term. Ok, first dose provides **94%** protection record, per source Vaccines less effective delta variant regardless.

Yes, Delta variant better getting around antibodies. matter still highly effective keeping hospital preventing severe illness?  good data showing near 100% death. 

It likely REALLY good, like 90%+, 100% numbers based misleading, misuses stats. unlike capitalist countries, never, ever that.  US CDC Fully vaccinated people * Refrain quarantine following known exposure refrain quarantine following known exposure, certainly refrain quarantine known exposures. US prohibits Palestine member exact reasoning 1. spread greater risk variants. 

2. Vaccinated parents bring virus home kids. 

3. high-level spread remains, virus eventually infect unvaccinated heavy toll life, hospitals, economically. Plus long term effects still learning about.

It never good plan okay virus washing everyone. think rhetorical question. And?   place went place grandparents mum went us, we've every Vaccine currently approved stock UK. Granddad Pfizer, Mum, Grandma Az, Moderna. know location necessarily correlate vaccine offered surprised medium-sized (220k pop) Northern England City one places giving Moderna 40s under. Oh no. Hope get better. Kids make perhaps 20% population. 26% refusing get vaccinated endangering children needlessly. I'm sure are, State every State surrounding open season many weeks - people bottom priority list getting second shots right now.

Note two articles barely 20 minutes apart. Delta variant, Anti-vaxxers irresponsible state government.  Don’t forget like 10 months ago article titles things like “There may never effective vaccine covid” “Masking may stay good” “Herd immunity impossible covid”. It’s devil new dress. Sure possible scenario. likely? Probably not. Okay, post purely political, you. balloon festival outside really reason shouldn’t happen outdoor event. real issue would local indoor businesses house parties happen around event could spread covid. know much observed severity disease infectiousness correlate, changes vaccine. seem differences vaccines regard? Miscarriages incredibly common zero evidence vaccine cause miscarriage. thing happened went get jab today. Pretty sure centre went one local area that’s Moderna. explain matters? I've always opinion mistake consider raw case increase evaluating current severity pandemic. matter 100,000 new cases reported handful actually progress need ICU death god forbid. cases mostly spreading across highly resilient segments population (young people, etc), cause concern reason extend increase restrictions? return normalcy *once everyone wants fully innoculated*. someone getting first two shots today, milestone still month half away.

Until time continue treat deadly contagion continue take precautions. in: Pfizer 100% effective infection. knew? Recent studies shown 12 weeks produces better response AstraZeneca. Waiting long following best dosage interval too. Well shut anti vaxxers Neither Chile. I'm interested know: 


1. many cases Delta happening - never mind hopsitalisation
2. actual cases vaccines preventing
3. many breakthrough cases Delta happening whom/what demographics
4. many deaths Delta among doubly vaxxed why
5. instance doubly vaxxed still get case COVID, still destroy insulin manufacturing islets pancreas, cause kidney, heart brain damage many cases Long COVID even doubly vaxxed
6. data showing kids transmit COVID get Long COVID - now?
7. India named new Delta Plus variant AY.1 (aka Delta + K417N mutation) upgraded “Variant Concern” India Ministry health faster transmission, stronger binding lung cells, special ability reduce efficacy certain monoclonal antibody drugs. ""  Stop reading much headlines. We've heard before. Keep mind go ""this problem"" ""we targeted mRNA booster"" 3 months. US least. Immunity on/off switch. Even strain better breaking current immunity, going go 0 100. going ""somewhat"" better breaking through. buys us time. Pretty much cherry picking data months Delta UK.

Just look Friday 80 got hospitalized 800 double dose vaccinated.

You say 90% effective that's still 10x worse RR Delta Alpha.

It might still true ICU mortality way though, longer spreads UK good vaccinations data get.

I’ve noticed covid vaccines get solid 4G 5G promised. That's support return normalcy. people make bad decisions, that's them. sad *want* happen, can't hostage either. Hmmm. guess mean outside South Asia. Bangladesh Pakistan gotten railed past year nothing right? mostly serves reports developed World now. spreads North America Europe, we'll see news. Incidence hospitalization low young people. defining problem pandemic. mean, India's average age 26, still seemingly millions deaths within month. Teddy Roosevelt aircraft carrier outbreak (with classic strain), 1.7% crew hospitalized.

Hospitalization time outcomes dramatically better young people, without hospital capacity still know would happen wealthy country spread allowed unchecked. government allowed happen since last February Lombardy.  insane, virus far risky older are, particularly risky general young people. way around. Delta Plus supposedly first identified Nepal. wouldn’t. unvaccinated cohorts largely younger individuals low incidence hospitalization. scenario Delta actually posed threat healthcare system one greatly reduced vaccine efficacy (which SAGE models played around with), know case already mostly knew based laboratory data mutations present variant high end, even top 10. probably thinking Mississippi. It’s true, it’s also true people died struck lightning. incredibly rare. Low vaccination numbers combined Delta variant. Fauci honestly lot credibility proven spent year lying trump time re-evaluate hiring practices 5/6 people office literally stupid live. weekly doubling 2% hospitalization rate, though, still easily submerge hospitals even infection cap 2/3 lower before.

Time absolutely side UK every quickly-vaccinating country now, though. month ago UK weekly doubling, they've given something like 15 million vaccine doses last month. +30-50% week now. another month, another 15 million doses, everything control. Every fast-vaccinating country far behind delta timeline (barring antivax pockets) easily able stay ahead it. usually takes time report. local ground able better tell what's going on. 

I reckon spreads outside India, they'll get better grasp it. Definitely - going time stop Alpha/Gamma/Delta infecting another billion people. need 8-12 billion doses end pandemic worldwide, still many months off. Go Hawaii!   base believes vaccine 5g mind control device. Well I’m glad you’re running things. “We vaccines, that’s it” really lazy reckless way dealing it. much consider I’m glad people power tend that. Yeah think could manage fairly well me. two little ones puts anxiety roof. (just keep telling self irrational kiddos). Bolsonaro: ""Yes."" wonder factors could *possibly* led outcome. Elite level trolling now. Delta plus???? Strap another year lockdown Huge respect medical workers everywhere, thank you! Yes like said earlier it’s complicated problem requires different approaches. Would even higher Indy lagging behind. developed anxiety never before. see situation similar last year, least keep things open.

Im also thankful don’t live here. enough self hating Americans begin with! enough unvaccinated people (covering age ranges etc) start new Phase 3 trial Turkey? BC everyone 12+ first dose high 2nd dose demand. first dose numbers still climbing +0.2-0.3%/day health authorities starting drop-in clinics.

July 1st next reopening step going well (and big one). Full reopen Sept 7 still, thats mass events clubs mostly.  husband fully vaccinated since April. time stop wearing masks I’m thinking get back it. don’t want start arguments, fully vaccinated here, still wearing yours? difference, variant shown resist antibody cocktail done. That’s quite long journey, phrased question go India instead Bangladesh Pakistan never ends :/ think mental health f'd last year. That’s said 

The vaccines suppressing available pool people infected. started scratch, B.1.1.7. had, say, 10 people available infect, B1.167 2. Even higher R0 isn’t pool people, hit “ceiling” much faster, never able infect initial amount people. seems everything Delta+ reports sourced India. made assessment yet? making joke lockdowns lead fewer deaths, therefore ""underkill"". Missourians stubborn anything benefits themselves. anyone came argue healthy adults dont need it. Trust vaccine far better alternative possibility Post Sequalae Covid. study basically confirms felt, masks better nothing ventilation, distancing measures also important. Like think masks fine grocery store I’m sure much 35 kids cramped classroom actually benefit. exact issue allergies cough post nasal drip. Allergies time Covid mind-f**k. Well within margin error, tons people ran wild numbers claiming Pfizer ""superior"" point created nonsense trend TikTok.  One thing consider vaccinate, smaller pool potential infected folks is, reduces chances variants popping up. Yes, possible, increasingly unlikely get doses flowing. Man, Israel truly fucked. 7-day average new cases almost 50. 7-day average COVID deaths almost 0. overcome brutal surge?  ever hear lab theory? getting traction nowadays, sounds whole lot plausible animal giving bat eaten random visitor market 20km next lab! Lol whut. literally keeping cool heads everyone around us freaks ""back normal"" throws caution (and masks) wind. keep chugging along thing we've past year half... getting old, man. getting old. We're eager vaccine. kids vaccinated ""the end"".  wonder numbers look ahead going back school fall (some) schools requiring mandatory vaccination  Taiwan essential modern world. Taiwan shuts down, production anything electronic grinds halt, since there's like 2-3 major semiconductor manufacturers world.   current PM Netherlands already involved multiple scandals guess creating another one, however small, would smarter move.  barely effective even previous variants. variant affect already vaccinated.

Unvaccinated people die. So? end world. anything, encourage people take vaccine.  vaccinated wld assume getting killer virus . Ppl Freedom choice risk death get vaccine ya'll. Spike republican lead states &amp; wonder .   Death penalty mass murder continuous rampage? free Japan.

That’s restrictions about. Slowing spread allow hospitals get overrun, going there. secondary purpose vaccine prevent transmission all, third lower chances Covid transmitting it. 

A big part also tie herd immunity protect others can’t get vaccine, big part got vaccinated early could (March) instead waiting county rolled around offered shot me. get entire world vaccinated. read this, put mind ease one phase III clinical trial efficacy tried different strains. It’s immunity actually builds slower day 14 28 it’s lower mRNA vaccines peaks day 57 high. ineffective you’d hearing issues infection news. 

The issue blood clot issue, paused. Well millions people gotten jab zero side effects. data side, yours. moron somewhere else.  use marvel character names then. There's always bootstraps! Good point. least meds I’m since post surgery last year vit Immunocompromised people say hi. Ok so, way look longer *active* colitis. body still fucked autoimmune mess, just, actively anymore. intents purposes good immunocompromised per se, just, also bit black box still.

I'm Australian, know anyone got covid ask eating like taste.  answer wrong. someone J Pouch well technically body still autoimmune issues. large since flaring flaring causes rest issues general, non zero number.     Wow call brain dead😂 great idea, Thank God... kick fat people insurance lazy premiums might go down. know started telling people vaccinated return normal.

They kept mask usage home, kept distance restrictions. Instead people think immortal like go want jab. That's going help anybody. Sweden's restrictions greater America almost full year (2 people gatherings etc). people still think never restrictions?  hate there's real way find well one's antibodies either unless studies etc. Like can't go get bloodwork done check antibodies still good levels not.  even counting cases/deaths vaccinated?  morbid perk doubt Holy fuck woman stubborn! Unfortunately looks like monoclonal antibody therapies may less effective everyone new studies suggest specific monoclonal antibody treatments may less effective treating cases COVID-19 caused variants certain substitutions combinations substitutions spike Can't everyone who's antivax claim religious exemption? died covid though, die. vaccinated, caught covid died.

It's inevitable died, evidence vaccinated enough stop covid. still need safe, especially mutates more. 

Thinking 100% immune die worst thing tell people. big worry immunocompromised individual. Thankfully time better medications come suppress specific parts immune system large I'm exponentially well immunocompromised individuals, but, nothing 100% either. could squashed COVID nothing opened back 80% fully vaccinated, never happen now. I'm glad live zip code that's rapidly approaching 80% right now; least leave apartment. Ah, meant second dose! Ah okay. I'm NZ, covid tests free option rapid test. wait 24-48 hours Really?? Rapid tests typically like half cost PCR test.

They’re free still Canada (Ontario), unless need travel case charge $90-$200 CAD PCR (depending get it), $45ish rapid. valid points place here. 😀 Hopefully vaccines cancer, HIV, diseases come soon! Problem that's happening. immunocompromised individual go concerts/raves/etc yet love them. people die vaccine, 100% effective death.

12 people England alone died Delta fully vaccinated.  remindme! 7 days Me: yet eligible vaccine 😭😭 You’re missing point here, receive vaccine odds death basically zero get Covid. Unlike flu older people flu shot still die it. 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 

Maybe I’m misremembering standard COVID tests, rapid test definitely free. know certain. 25,000 got vaccinated.

150 also interesting much hate health care workers, doctors, vaccine scientists vaccine hesitant

What makes think doctors vaccine scientists among group?

As far tell, leader, presumably person ""authority"" group RN. That's bachelors degree. Pretty sure MDs group, they'd made ""face"" group, come authority.

See hospital workers actually medically trained employees, lot articles conflated two groups together. Vaccination rates rise amount education - virtually doctors vaccinated, instance. small percentage nurses aren't. Hospital food janitorial workers tend least likely hospital workers get vaccinated.

I prefer taking medical advice doctors, rather janitors, personally. Tests still free ton places. amount times I’ve heard people say stay home. (Or, it’s ok, it’s old weak dying). I’m 40 year old mother running business also life outside home, stayed home year, can’t carry staying home. always wonder people would like pay bills me. sure think family do, unless think isolate forever home people live with. It’s upsetting I’ve removed friends life don’t get it.  honest, main reason hesitant mix shots. However, realized catch COVID, especially new Delta variant, may able travel since I’ll dead. fuck it.. 2nd shot Moderna 1st shot Pfizer last Sunday. province scheduling Pfizer appointment, say, won’t get till late July. Pfizerna FTW! I’ll cross bridge regards border crossings time comes. likely would improve protection, currently recommended. possible people received J&amp;J upfront offered mRNA boosters future, though, people two-shot mRNA regimen may may need them. matter studies suggest mixing vaccines might better.  work like that. longer big portion population remains unvaccinated, chances escape mutant emerging virus keep circulating replicating mutating unvaccinated people. Appointments ~6 weeks city outside Toronto, willing able wait outside popup clinic, 21 days Pfizer 28 Moderna. actually make really strong argument Delta variant surge UK due part entire segment population vaccination coverage. high-risk people (immunocompromised, critical occupations) age 18-29 received vaccines low risk people older age groups, immunity would better spread around population.

As older individual higher risk travels frequently abroad interacts disproportionately large number people, Merkel prioritized - public health reasons, political ones.  one states could decades becomes endemic, like common cold: another: expect? elected Tom Cotton 🤮 Come NRW, get anything right unless good connections. brother Prio 3 laughed contacted doctors appointments available Vaccination Centers. NRW must much higher vaccination uptake states. People driving Bonn Near Berlin get vaccines. 8 states

[USA trends week ended Sunday, eight states reported increases COVID-19 cases, compared 20 states previous highest increase 35 percent CDC reported Florida new cases past 7 days 10,329. That’s previous second 7,408 new cases past week, 1,000 fewer previous week. California third 6,706 new cases, almost 3,000 previous fourth place 4,792 new cases. state reporting increase cases hospitalizations past week, especially areas frequented fifth 3,002 new cases.

Imagine eating favorite food, even something think disgusting, taste air. Doublespeak Good. Well it’s effectively free anyone uninsured Medicare/Medicaid.

It’s us idiots paying treat (now) entirely preventable condition  tried read bit pulls ridiculous conspiracies stopped.

Like may genuine concern it, small risk - anything hate there’s much twisting negativity, pushing anti vaccination. 

Just give straight, doc :P ""Needlessly"" could double meaning (""without needles""). Damn censorship group think crazy Waiting possible third dose. immunocompromised sucks misinformation age accepts conspiracies science It’s another tool toolbox Spanish police state. enforced randomly cops. richer barrios Madrid hardly cared it. guess countries free testing. Europe common pay too. 

It's common pay Europe, least western Europe anyway.

Tests free least Netherlands, Belgium, France, Germany, Switzerland. countries I'm aware testing situation live personally know people do.

In countries pay need test certificate travel purposes, want know infected, tests typically free. testing freely available Canada. i’m surprised US Europe information I’m seeing inventor mRNA tech saying covid vac spike toxic, building organs ovaries something Japan study? I’ve received first dose 3 weeks ago, something concerned antivaxx nonsense? got 2nd shot today! blame them? 

How harmful Covid 12 16 population? Given “low risk” parents feel worried exposing child unknown even vaccinated. Talking kids general good health here, at-risk population, imagine thought process lot easier. first dose Pfizer I’m scared get 2nd 🙃 It’s weird decade. people fantastic shape. others never took care nursing homes

As nurse it’s weird parents 60s better shape friends, also patients age range look like they’re 90 left behind. infuriating. Also RN. think 6 7 coworkers didn’t get reason Wish luck India. I'm glad Modi administration finally taking seriously. shame took death pretty massive scale make happen. give damn health others, belong medicine. Adios good riddance. one ever reported vaccines 100% effective. mean 70% Adults? Hiding information opposed persistent scaremongering? Talking government - repeatedly seem fail understand expenses prevent much higher losses. kind free testing, need sent doctor. introduced general free testing situation worst healthcare system brink collapse. severely limit afterwards.  


In way invest sequencing measures. know someone AK like that. says always strong reactions vaccines. afford take work 5 days. that’s long sick last time got vaccine. sponsored athletic cyclist ended four serious autoimmune conditions light infection take unintelligible misunderstandings covid hurts anyone shove ass. covid didn’t really need vaccine  Here's view legal scholars suspect Jacobson vs. Mass much still relevant, despite finding New York last year Cuomos ban religious gatherings (even though interest public health) constituted violation first amendment since levied restrictions specifically religious activities. Prepare people claim they're persecuted religion far argument given consideration (especially SC). 

Some might able skirt employer mandated vaccines use legitimate complaints related ADA, would prove compelling medical reason cannot get vaccine. Contrary people many people claim, violation HIPAA. 

The authors also assert claim employers cannot make mandatory vaccination that's emergency use authorization incorrect law clearly says carry weight full authorization. Soviet Union beat Germany. schools mandating would probably cross us herd immunity would guess thought point comment prove know immunology - definitely don’t can’t respond reasonable way first point. told someone thread immunosuppression wouldn’t ballpark tx patient - referencing. 

In response second point, understand “standard” dosage, characterizing tx patients “severely” immunosuppressed? New tx patients barely put 2 mg tac BID steroid support. Again, obviously immunosuppressed. reasons Covid particular concern us nothing immunosuppression generally - rather, it’s use antimetabolites drug regimes bc effect vaccine efficacy (you didn’t really respond this...) 

Third point: doubt much familiar odds severe complications due Covid brings crux argument points making here: using undeniable depth knowledge research behind immunosuppression conjecture lived experience transplant patients multiple transplant patients thread told correct. hospitalized (knock wood) since graft serious concern hospital acquired infection day day life. four year old though could easily bring home Covid preschool. One things greater concern choices make current world live in. legalise cannabis federally 80% people 18-30 get vaccinated. Like make part law. thing happens diseases. Younger people get vaccinated flu older people tend die it.

The question point becomes largely acceptable risk covid, like diseases.

For clarity btw - I'm one people thought historical covid response overblown. anything, think often little late UK. 

But need exit strategy (based numbers dates - understand pandemic unpredictable) openly addresses fact point covid safe enough become another disease need live accept people get ill die from.

A lot places may yet - may enough concern delta variant, countries may hit level vaccination need. 

But headlines (and know seem _quite_ he'd actually said) suggest covid restrictions need stay vaccines perfect start sound like going remove restrictions covid goes away completely - that's going happen. could go either way.

He could gotten one want known, due air rhetoric, could gotten one, enjoying benefit “vaccinated don’t need wear masks use honor system”. really surprising. Go rural town literally seems like 100% overweight. 

Well ones aren’t meth heads anyway possible next step fired. think also thing Germany died would big deal replace her. USA would take whole new election. Germany hold session Bundestag elect replacement. Biggy. Inspector Spacetime know several people US gotten J&amp;J. They've done mass vaccinations Alma matter. can't find exactly many people US vaccine. found article middle April saying 7 million, one middle May saying less 9 million. found article saying demand J&amp;J ""slowed crawl, leaving close half 21 million doses produced United States sitting unused."" probably 9 12 million people US J&amp;J vaccine. Man, hope case seriously doubt it. Despite warnings unvaccinated must wear masks, kids around going parents maskless everywhere. zoo yesterday, kid one maybe 5-6 kids masks. Yes looks way, I'm honestly little surprised by. would think government's best interest offer free remove barriers testing get truer insight many people currently infected Yes believe Germany. Angela Merkel head government. Since Germany federal republic actual decisions mainly made heads individual states minister health. died today would change little.

The chancellor elected directly people. VC would take shortly Bundestag would session confirm replacement. Biggy. like undefeated, back back World War champs! free decide kind stuff gets injected body right? see dangerous argument ""you get choose body safety people"" future? Sure SCOTUS back too. Yeah, go specific places take insurance test US, least Portland, (a liberal city). 

A test Zoomcare, urgent care place Portland, take Medicaid Medicare (so luck poor, unemployed, elderly/retired) $85. 

*With* medicaid, closest non-ER place get tested hour outside city. bullshit. Insurance companies going start pulling back paying Covid treatments. Enjoy bankruptcy, recover Covid. Lmao getting downvoted complete burn maybe dumbest statement read year reddit. Never change reddit religious reasons? really different belief anti-vaxers think dangerous whatever? groups unreasonable, unproven dangerous beliefs.

In eyes, reasons acceptable medical reasons. 

If get vaccinated religious reasons, spread disease immunocompromised person dies, it's, rather drastic opinion, domain religious homicide. won’t need Denmark listen phone calls. Ah ok. Yeah NRW chance. BioNTech production facilities Germany, doses produced probably labeled ""Comirnaty"", doses produced Pfizer Belgium US probably labeled ""Pfizer"".

The ""Comirnaty"" name intended Europe only, according German Wikipedia, guess unable pick different label doses exported Singapore. important says label, all.

So that's German Marburg production apparently going July. Deliveries EU smaller June. I'm glad Singapore use doses, need many that's cool! employer realises much money save smaller office less running costs. find might cheaper employ people another country job boom outsourced economy. It’s going happen. way back. building company looking employ staff South Africa. time zone salaries way cheaper. There's law says can't get vaccinated twice. say undocumented immigrant go free money.  Yup, feel way, trying find sort balance though.


My wife Catholic, go there. actually grew Mormon, left many reasons. Lot respect people (I really good ward/congregation), religion me. Also, found like coffee... **a lot**.


For Catholics, every Sunday required, apparently 5-10 ""Holy days obligation"" (fun name huh) required well. think average Catholic technically goes though. Israeli government data would disagree finally Darwin true work. Free Germany, even mandatory several activities.

We test stations make test without appointment mind business that. 15-20 min later get notification mobile use proof wherever need it.

You also buy discounters, document prove 

School kids get tested twice per week. Many companies offer employees (mine does), many companies try organize vaccinations employees (mine did).

No clue works traveling outside Germany.

I'm pretty convinced testing big factor low numbers atm. actually working quite well yet vaccines still effective BaWü. guess countries free testing. Europe common pay too. pay day average salary one test, might think twice. would love J&amp;J shot. you?

The German system mess. You’re cringe seemed read different article. article,

*The director-general Health Ministry, Chezy Levy, told Israeli television 70 percent new infections Delta variant. also noted half infected children, third infected vaccinated.* bet we’d see huge uptick said everyone vaccinated August 1st gets $200. Yeah, gave $5 coupon bought stuff waiting 15 minutes make stay store case get allergic reaction.  Wow stats show stereotypical trends makes laugh little bit. course last states going stubborn southern conservative states country. first thing I’d start read comment carefully 

1. Actually, management IBD autoimmune disorders quite different theory practice. point graft rejection blanket potential cellular immune response avoid near instant destruction tissue. Immunology quite complex CD4 CD8 recognition MHC’s invariably lead clonal expansion B cell repertoire, leads whole host cascade immune reactions. progression isn’t similar IBD/rheumatic disorders. high dosage, significant amount suppression post transplant ensure initial cascade doesn’t happen. right; generally degree suppression period time transplantation titrated lower infection risk. it’s still significant. that?

Well, Crohns/UC patients benefit biologics much targeted suppression (the one guy talking targets TNF-a, pro-Apoptotic cytokine, adverse effect certain types cancer). still results suppression systematically degree, it’s blanket suppression say cyclosporin. Another thing mentioned incorrect cyclosporine usage. much still used transplantation, depend circumstances. It’s also sometimes used Crohns treatment well treatment rheumatic disorders (also topical form dry eyes). 

2. There’s “standard” dosage Crohns. someone suffers RA, autoimmune disorders/rheumatic disorders thing standard dose. Dosing based patients symptoms available data, don’t start every patient disorder stuff dosage, there’s much variability conditions presentation. combos drugs *usually* work well. 

3. could named lots bacteria, I’m familiar acenitobacter since research it. It’s rare infection. Actually, it’s increasingly common hospital acquired infection far bigger problem in, guessed it, severely immunocompromised individuals, often post-op. compare two, ought consider catch covid, likelihood okay (most data oddly enough shows age much bigger factor even lot co-morbidities), given condition, go hospital procedure, absolutely could contract acenitobacter infection, outcome far worse. many, all.

Maybe doctors didn’t ignore us treat us like hysterical pea brained idiots wouldn’t case. There’s huge lack respect women medical community undoubtedly contributing factor people get pushed anti vaxx pipeline. 

Just look women first reporting vaccine messed period. first response “You’re wrong; must lying cycle” many women reported side effect legitimately look it. know? stress making significant immune response *can,* fact, cause temporary disruptions someone’s cycle weren’t lying exaggerating symptoms. Another excellent example looking common PCOS endo yet many women spend years fighting diagnosis doctors think we’re lying reason. took diagnosed condition effects [up peers, wouldn’t skeptical doctors too? 

Not there’s excuse anti vaxxers doesn’t surprise women likely fall women regularly fight receive adequate health care. don’t really trust doctors matter go see, two responses get “Let’s pregnancy test” “When next period?” I’ve accepted won’t get treatment unless I’m literally dying anything less passing ER period.

LMAO already do, aware this? long adults take vaccines. still lot Cole Beasleys wandering around America listening conspiracy theories vaccines like make people magnetic, etc. think reading different reports.

This page says 10-15% people experience mild flu like symptoms day two vaccine. 

It also says skip specific allergies currently low blood platelet count. avoid severe/rare side effects.

I see mention anything else side effects everyone acknowledges people care much about. Oh, treatment variants resistant to. Got Arkansas here. feel pain Check sources Good. badly non-BJP states handle it?All relatives even 87 year old grandmother got covid came relatively unscathed, thinks pretty good job(i talking Kerala btw).

Meanwhile places like Bangalore Udupi complete shitshow seen/heard. Tell taking shots. Cool, replies responses would give thought talking someone giving elliptical references. best advice long time

Thanks Mortegro545 [I'm saving actually stated beginning nothing worry virus get people panic. put precautions place basically fucked everything. are, still lockdown year cases still high. Potential long term side effects like covid has? [Lungs, heart, That's saying people vaccinated want soon possible (9% adults):


-14% busy

-12% able take time work. 

Together that's 2% adults super impactful. Furthermore might saying survey doubt it. point walk CVS, Walgreens, Walmart, Kroger etc.. get shot without appointment. truly wanted shot would already. 

Incentives like $100 employers vaccine lotteries impactful. comment elliptical reference certain antivaxxers waste time allowing make appointment intention going to. Ok also increase medical insurance premiums people decisions? Giving insurance companies carte blanche raise rates according covid make richer. Check out, get new Variants couple months/years increase premium get new vaccine. repeat add infinitum. they, goal make money. Also, never insurance company legally allowed increase rates according vaccines had. setting dangerous precedent. Perfect, we'll educate first generation of... oh no.   entirely preventable. getting vaccine prevent 100%, everyone could get did, covid would entirely gone month wasn't. first discovered India.   know simple solution, immunocompromised, move enlightened state actually cares getting vaccinated.   Ok let's follow train thought. must legally force/ tax higher rate/ force decisions people stop smoking. Also, fast food processed food causes many deaths per year. Let's force reduction certain meal choices prevent deaths. Hey motorcycles dangerous too, make illegal people motorcycles ride fast. It. Never. Ends.  positive virus needs spike protein enter cells. can't mutate much wind becoming non human contractable virus. That's mutations far vaccines bit less effective, overall still pretty good. massive side effects don’t know about

Honestly, lol. even stop think writing? completely get this. sister heart problem kind still holding reports myocarditis (I understand it’s null that’s GAD happens). Anyone saying risk ignorant idiot. Likewise, anyone saying probable effects vaccine worse effects actually getting covid also idiot, harmful one that. Tell New Normal. Viruses need hosts mutate dangerous variant. vaccination population, less opportunity variants. fully authorized. means risk safety profiles good. point anyone choosing take vaccine risk insurance. high one that. Especially older are. 70 year old dude wanted life insurance, vaccinated, would sell plan. True. However, thought read waiting least 90 days best. hope so. polyethylene glycol? What's address. I'll mail pair sunglasses. 2nd Gen stupid preventable condoms. believe countries following guidelines, think mention mixing mRNA vaccines. (copied yesterday someone else asked quesiton:)

Please get vaccinated. OP saw comment. might survived weaker strain. strain going become dominant stain...is Delta variant. someone might fought original, subsequent varaints become signifigantly worse. Delta variant swept India caused 400,000 cases per day....after thought ""beaten"" virus. covid ""on steroids""...so....it virus, therefore anti-bodies might able over-come variant.

​

Also...anti-bodies dissipate time. know long last. 3-6 months seem reduce, risk getting re-infected, possibily even dying get hit bad variant.

It’s obviously Fauci’s fault /s talking headline what's false it? stated nearly every adult currently dying COVID (implicitly within US) could've prevented they'd fully vaccinated. That's absolutely true, I've read number articles stating nearly ever patient American hospital COVID wards vaccinated. state **every** adult dying COVID could prevented, rather *nearly* every one could prevented (with intent motivate unvaccinated people finally go get vaccine).

We've never 100% safe infectious diseases. That's reasonable standard returning 'normal'. Bringing approximately danger flu, deadly seasonal respiratory disease prior COVID, enough considered normal level risk. We're lucky vaccines effective. Moderna Pfizer far effective typical flu vaccines. I’d like preface saying Im doctor, I’m actually immunologist trade pharmacology related experience.

No, far know would fall “severely” immunocompromised, it’s exactly like there’s set definition that. Generally talk really severe immune suppression, it’s stuff like high dose cyclosporine post transplant. goal basically eradicate immune system time being, largely immune response foreign organ tissue would strong, like could quantify would several orders magnitude greater autoimmune response you’re experiencing Crohns. people, really can’t fight much stuff off, chances opportunistic infection quite high. Actually, transplant ID like subdivision ID, put perpective, there’s Chrons/autoimmune ID.

No responsible doctor would prescribe immune suppressant drugs strength dosage you’d use transplant scenario Chrons, risk would great. guess answer question no, you’re really category transplant patients.

Given data biologic, advise would probably stop Methotrexate get vaccinated, suppose restart it. that’s really based infliximab data fact blanket immunity suppressants gonna usually cause less targeted suppression biologics. understand methotrexate + infliximab pretty common combo treatment Crohns, I’m surprised doctor prescribed that. again, I’m doctor really talk instead. point way two-fold.

There nothing discuss question fully vaccinated answer yes according acceptable cdc req’ts. doesn’t say considered fully vaccinated unless course could waited longer gotten one travelled another province/country get it?

Just means keeping mask mandate social distancing, pretty reasonable since canadians usually civil responsible comes things.

People whining wear mask shops, disrespectful people lost either loved ones job. Careful misinterpret this... interpret ""60% chance prevented GETTING Delta variant."" Yeah great J&amp;J prevent us getting original Covid either.

J&amp;J makes chance severely sick (needing go hospital help) original Covid already extremely slim. waiting hear Delta variant. important piece info. saves lives.

I'll never understand argument. proud live somewhere backwards ass individuals. I'm grateful live also talk shit openly. I'm shocked even ask.  Thank you! nothing politics, need bring voted for.

Cool, question I'm tired asking every single time getting answers....what direct effects preventing long covid?

Hopefully fully vaccinated carry live step anti vaxxers  * yes, vulnerable people remain isolated
* masks everyone. new normal masks, directly correlates new infections
* ""vaccine passport"" thing would theoretically allowed us open travel gatherings quickly, without (and agree problematic) allowing unrestricted superspreader conditions still risky

Basically, err side caution. know everyone's impatient call over, something new dealing could save hundreds thousands lives taking basic precautions would that. Yeah purge everyone don’t like. always goes well US CDC website says mRNA vaccines interchangeable, limited data exists mixing matching, consider one-shot full two-dose-of-same regimens recommended “fully vaccinated.” Maybe guidance change, maybe CDC guidance change, that’s now.

There studies mixing AZ/mRNA multiple countries confident that’ll acceptable. one else mixing mRNAs don’t bother updating guidance small edge case stuck.

Many countries require two shots considered ""fully vaccinated"".  really; caused 5 day bump numbers tanked again. couple thousand shots day given agree 100%. anti-vaxxers screwing everyone. feels like immunocompromised getting even left behind. wish vaccine passports thing that'd easy way spot hunker down, everything right vs unvaccinated immunocompromised could easily avoid people. ones put this. you, sensible people. matter able take it. issue immunocompromised people getting vaccine, effective. kind did. Earlier pandemic, head Operation Warp Speed said half dose Moderna (50mcg) produced identical immune response full dose (100 mcg). seen phase 2 trials. knew full dose worked want risk impact half doses.

Maybe we'll see booster Back track you’re Uhhh what? Ohio recently red still multiple large cities extremely blue. ok good things generally point go ‘back’ restrictions? supposed wear masks next 10 years? Covid going continue circulating become endemic won’t leave us quite time. I’m sure realistic continue restrictions/measures indefinitely. Even mandated, whole people stop listening. There’s indication jobs people held article I’ve read this. lot people lost jobs may background science post high school education.

In articles it’s mentioned hospital almost 25,000 employees. hundred filed paper work get waiver medical religious reason. me, means everyone fired made conscious decision make political statement part legal action instead filing paperwork would let avoid vaccinated still keeping jobs. Pfizer use penny Operation Warpspeed research. posted government recommendations, article people denying doses. data articles published that? think lot people assume immunocompromised people also live alone control contacts aren’t also people kids young vaccinated wear masks. that's actually judge said, appeal easy. Hospitalization spelled wrong Looking around, seeing much ""high-quality information"". however see lot questions, commentary opinions, dissimilar mine.

But get it, free speech tough concept grasp, nobody obliged beyond means.  Delta Plus literally first identified Europe, India lol Good. Personally booking second shot tomorrow knowing getting moderna first shot Pfizer , hesitancy surrounding mixing making many walk second shot , sadly it’ll slow numbers . mRNA vaccine , haven’t actually seen data country besides Canada looking Stupidity preventable always work way. get your, know, ""logic"" whatever actually pretty normal organizations comment random shit turns up

*sniffs panties*



Good boy! Available vaccines work quite well delta variant, although tad less effectively OG. Two doses either mRNA vaccine work almost well delta OG, single dose cut it. took Tylenol second moderna shot symptoms helped immediately. Hope feel better soon!  I'd willing bet two intersect. investment education trust government science. true, would worse infected virus. know deadlier per se, there's suggestion morr likely cause severe illness om younger individuals. I’m sorry going that. tough road long. Yeah would horrible. remember wife diagnosed Ceolic go gluten free horrible eat favourite foods. actually made logical sense me. small amount people a.) Can't get vaccine may contract covid unpreventable vector b.) caught covid prior widespread vaccine distribution die it/related complecations 100% covid deaths entirely preventable. anyone falling outside category fatality totally preventable medical outcome. Really?

The national vaccination rate as, worse than, India's rate - almost nobody seems second dose metro areas.

This due total failure government messaging rollout, exacerbated decision throw money Liberal Party mates lobbyists AstraZeneca (and MPs CSL shares), instead buying manufacturing mRNA jabs Pfizer Moderna... decision looked even idiotic whole AZ clotting debacle.

Given government's incompetence, suppose miracle even vaccine begin with. Yup. delta variant Tyrannosaurus Rek southern US. huge portion family refuses vaccine Facebook I'm angry.    Sadly, condition congenital heart defect carry entire life. happy say condition mild compared heart kids. common, 1 100 children born sort heart defect. Living Florida mixed bag mask wearing vaccinated folks vs non vaccinated. don’t want anything happen son. whole thing absolutely terrifying. I’m counting days vaccine age group. ""children, immunocompromised people, people documented allergies suck ass"" Thanks response. venting frustration overall lack info J&amp;J. 30 45 mostly one vaccine moment fully vaccinated. 50+ largely fully vaccinated. might call intentional Orwellian doublespeak. One dose surprisingly effective OG corona, delta variant (which dominant variant UK) give fuck single dose, need two prevent it, least according early reports. still learning new strain consensus seems vaccines work, albeit tad less effectively. Makes second dose important. 

If infected sars-cov-2 that's different story, actual infection event basically counts shot. need get doses. virus evolving rapidly need fully protected. I’ve actually looked studies done MRNA vaccines. point 2 say 'vaccines'. vaccines reduce infection, need mRNA (there might slight differences percentage depending study/conditions/precise definition infected). Since Texas right work state, courts overwhelmingly side employer. see, thought perspective.

Glad see folks running hospitals Houston putting anti-vax bullshit. live Moscow Yesterday I’ve injected first Sputnik V shot. Today temperature 37c feeling great. Stay safe  AZ trust undermined poor government communication / changing guidelines, media jumps every clot (2 dead close 4mil doses), real imperative get vaccinated due basically COVID free (until get outbreaks quarrantine).

Also anyone 60 meant get Pfizer supply constraints. good see vaccinations accelerating. Hopefully majority elderly bulnerable received least one dose start Olympics. anyone got vaccine issue proof vaccine laminated? vaccine disrupted industries level sending waves shortages entire infrastructure. altered lives, perspectives, relationships, careers more. orgasmic ratings battle that's changed face advertising packaging modified cope.

Like 1, 1.11, 1.11.7, 1.11.7.0.3 on. IIRC Chinese already administering third doses. that, Moderna, Pfizer/BioNTech AstraZeneca testing booster shots - essentially third dose. booster shot could either additional shot vaccine, tweaked version provide better protection variants.  Yes, mutations! anyone keep mind ease? 

I took Sinovac (Chinese Vaccine) shot last Monday first vaccine available. day informed could've gotten Pfizer instead waited 1 day. 

I love travel lot (and job requires travel US/EU often over) impatience prevent near future? I'm feeling bit sadness hindsight cause could preventable waited literally 1 day. 

Or maybe anyone guess Sinovac acknowledged aforementioned places? I'll probably need booster anyway I'm also sure recognized ""vaccinated"".  think getting voted, except say several studies, probably include link least one. see thread linked. I've seen, evidence seems pointing direction. origin story Lambdadelta? think simply dumb + internet terrible mix No. expert subject might wrong - please correct then.

My understanding mRNA vaccines inject messenger RNA containing instructions covid spike protein. mRNA covered lipids protect way. RNA enters cells, start producing spike protein. body detect protein start producing antibodies. protein harmless itself, body prepared deal real deal necessary.

Vector based vaccines (AstraZeneca, Johnsson&amp;Johnsson, Sputnik V) take somewhat similar approach also make body produce spike protein (or similar, think AZ uses spike protein). difference use vector virus (adenovirus) deliver genetic code.

Inactivated virus vaccines like Sinopharm, Sinovac, Bharat Valneva use inactivated form real coronavirus. however ""disabled"" reproduce body pose threat. traditional form vaccines.

There's also protein vaccines like Novavax know less about. get workers countries, get Qatar take passports make work less Stupid, racist people failed nation, rather racist anti-vaxxers failed show care community.

11% representing 881 agents gives roughly 8,000 agents total article says 25,000 tests administered. That's 3.1 tests per agent, they're much likely caught majority cases gen population testing. would say likely lower percentage agents infected general population. people could that, that, mostly read headline.

This preview America.  Congrats! mean, think it’s “nearly”. It’s word range, doesn’t specific percent 50? Youngers fullfiled ""social contract"" yet, still waiting vaccinated.
Is better ignore them, middle variant severely affects unvaccinated youngers? logic punishing adults vaccinated. medical guinea pig? 

Those stay unvaccinated guinea pigs, testing else covid body themselves.  one makes sense. saying everyone idk vaccinated high school kids would need it. Maybe verification enforcement thing? Either way school age kid elementary something mind guess. Oh old ""flu"" bullshit.

Dr. Q please enlighten us extensive knowledge Covid-19.

That take time leave lab confused risk Delta variant persons doses MRNA vaccine. understand numbers used. 
 
Do efficacy estimates preventing symptomatic disease refer subset vaccinated population actually contracted virus, making smallish number, refer entire vaccinated population, making potentially large number? 
 
As recall, unvaccinated population original Covid variant cause symptomatic disease 85% persons contracted somewhere around 2% hospitalized. really saying fully vaccinated people similar risk Delta unvaccinated people original virus? seem also recall one studies botched / questionable, might explain go results it.

Personally, hoping get Moderna, Pfizer on-tap clinic arrived that's got. me. I'm eagerly awaiting second dose anything. Anything return semblance normality. Myocarditis also happen young people COVID infection, really hope doesn’t hold things much! 85% reduction symptoms case load What's even worse, coronaviruses also labelled Greek letters. Covid-19, SARS bovine coronavirus human coronaviruses  went pack smokes day pack gum day.  Wow 16k cases, Delta varriant serious. Sure, still noticed uptick delta variant recently want time find late. rate, winner one fortunately avoided COVID-19.

Anybody, athletes included, supported Olympic helping spread COVID-19, helping mutate even deadly version virus. Sure, still noticed rise cases delta variant want contain it. Sometimes overdue pre-cautions know more. Half assing late got mess. Thanks!! That’s good news Someone mentioned (previous post) Israel took lead vaccination. Got majority population vaccinated majority countries could finish elder vaccinated.
Could time another round vaccination? Thoughtful insightful comment, thanks this!! 14 days close contact carrier delta variant. Thats says, read article? everyone lock down, ""try best self isolate know encountered it"". everyone matter ailment times, even common cold. purposefully bring shit everywhere go. gross. cops infected similar rate secret service agents, would expect closer 0.03%.  Sir, Wendy’s. seriously dropped masking mandates early. matters they're likely come contact it. However, agree taking extra vigilance begin confused risk Delta variant persons doses MRNA vaccine. understand numbers tossed around.

Other news reports suggest Delta MRNA may 80-85% effective preventing symptomatic illness, (some reports) hospitalization (other reports.) don't' understand.

What missing here? Assuming cops 25 50, trusting statistic 95% people died 50: 150 police died covid February 2021, 800k 0.019% cops died covid. Add marginal amount may died since Feb, calculation already accounts additional 10 rounding, cases deaths way since February. General population age 25 50 0.02% dead covid. also assumes cops died 50. likely case, would widen margin AWAY general population, widening gap. No, “tested positive” “infected” mean thing. rate false positives incredibly low, we’ve seen easily virus spreads close quarters. it’s surprise co-workers unable socially distance travel together would easily spread other.  They'll find another excuse July 19th No. Many Individual states will. 

Overall, percentage one shot 67% 18 July 4.

Some states around 45% weigh average. Others 80% 85%. Many stuck around 60%. though? already knew even best vaccines 100% effective Let’s say two treatments given affliction, one costs $30, costs $30,000. may want force insurance pay $30,000 one reason, expense everyone else. Everyone else justified problem that. go ahead stop punishing people fulfilled entirety social contract People could just... read article understand decision halt spread variant, kids teens fully vaccinated yet Israel. delta variant impacts (youngers) way strain/variant.  Asymptomatic transmission extremely unlikely. Presymptomatic transmission, think mean different story. Canada take stuff seriously! Kids could potentially vaccinated enough adults got hit herd immunity... would still need limit contact kids outbreaks least outbreaks would fizzle shut affected school. 

The real problem course convincing enough adults get vaccinated herd immunity reached without kids.  They're switching from[""permission vaccinate"" adolescents [multiple large outbreaks linked 7 day average cases 54 - numbers low, school outbreaks going massively skew numbers. saying ""cases 3x higher!!!"" lacks huge amount context consider difference 37 cases/day *millions* people.   believe CEO Morgan Stanley said something along lines of: expect keep NYC pay, need start showing NYC office.  really. adjectives emphasize common case deaths COVID preventability cases vaccines. Tomorrow I'm invading North Korea home. possibility exist universal vaccinations vulnerable demographics? Yeah, might case countries would accept simple jag enough proof travel. seen countries would except single jag requirements though (haven't looked every single travel requirement). Maybe Spain, think even expect get tested coming. wish! kid's school ditched masks see bringing back.

Glad got shots. point, anyone get vaccine won’t, either lazy, ignorant, coward. cases extremely rare mild.

Just like Covid itself, 2-12 age group. sound India.

It sounds different reported west.

My wife vaccinated months ago, kids eligible yet. I'm Colorado kids district got rid mask mandates schools. know district didn't. really. 100% effective 95% people. 95% effective people. tonight. Seems common get mild fever 8-12 hours shot.

So get shot can. way pop Tylenol sleep fever end day. new group emerged covid battle. overly cautious guidance followers anti maskers/vaccers also people got excited progress we’ve made want believe since they’ve gotten vaccinated problem anyone still concerned idiot doesn’t trust science. http://www.boostoregon.org/arent-vaccines-just-moneymakers-for-pharmaceutical-companies  drove 100 miles roundtrip get first dose. Repeat second dose. We're fine locking know necessary. we're fine us slow rollout vaccines makes necessary.
 
For example, state lockdowns multiple weeks beginning trying figure everything out. Since we've short lockdowns (few days) cases detected need stop movement trace it. travel restrictions states times. rest time life reasonably normal except extra social distancing. Sweden much slower comparison... would suggest? Exponential growth always starts slow.

The UK hit 16k cases today, last week around 9k 10k. Zoe data shows peak soon?

It interesting see happens hospitalizations. Sure memorizing tracking students make sure wear them, especially large school practical.

On hand, everywhere else putting honor system, would different high school? everyone eligible vaccine months, maintain?

I could see arguments.  “There earlier similar concerns alpha variant (B.1.1.7) acquired E484K immune escape mutation. happened several times independently none alpha lineages carrying E484K particularly successful end.”

I think part really good. definitely good watch variant, alpha E484K variant strong argument tacking immune escape mutations always work.

The spike proteins surely change, could totally break vaccines given enough time. happening variants. mean, seeing happen. People would blind see it. news. 

So, virus could make vaccines practically ineffective. Modern Pfizer working booster shots 2 months now. due later year. means pandemic going go longer people think people take vaccines least years.

Last time checked, vaccines targets specific proteins spike. spikes changed, proteins changed enough, could still get ACE2 receptor --and TLR4 possibly CD147 receptors* nobody seems know -- still vaccines less affective seeing variant capable reinfecting people fully vaccinated. 

Not anti-vaxxer seems hole people's logic lack information. One seem addressed experts TV either. go get info Academic Papers everyone that. 

Why talked about? guess? Carrying narrative masses might discourage people know this.

No one said deserve die, make better decisions risk faced reality risk. Oh come on, can’t case vaccinated people forced go back office unvaccinated get stay home. 

Why give vaccinated people choice either stay home go back office unvaccinated stay home.

One especially bad variant could set back progress far. mention endanger people cannot vaccinated medical reasons. let's work gun death Yes. know people die them, right? unvaccinated people die higher rates vaccinated people, right?

So population around longer, greater influence: vaccinated unvaccinated? think Stanford study justifies lockdowns done here. don’t remember scanning electron micrograph apoptotic cell (blue) infected SARS-COV-2 virus particles (orange), isolated patient sample.NIAID

The imaging NIH and/or NIAD incredible entire outbreak. take vaccines us (Poland) - 6M unused doses. receive around 3M doses per week vaccinating 2M per week, backlog rises 1M week. even joking, countries use doses get can't. makes sense hoard them. Agree they'll get high level vaccination coverage open up, way stay closed ""the rest world brought Covid control,"" simply never happen. Covid stay.

Australia New Zealand *will* eventually make hard choice let virus in, enter lockdown community spread. There's maybe it, alternative literally quarantine forever, would become ""hermit kingdoms"" falling behind socially economically rest world opens up.

That's pretty stupid inference Shouldn’t cases increasing vaccines now?

Featuring Dante Devil May Cry series Shit. data percentage hospitalized people died fully vaccinated? what’s point positive v infected? Osterholm king scary sound bites, made numerous failed predictions throughout pandemic. far reasonable nuanced expert Dr. Scott Gottlieb.

In event, vaccine still highly protective Delta variant. People need stop idiots get shots. Actually, shouldn’t even lower using protocols public wasn’t? photo N95 masks.
Edit: one guy does. can’t see others clearly enough sure. felt like shit second dose. thought first dose mild, unless previously COVID? Double zed plural alpha. Yes, yes yes international travel this. whats showing peoples youtube fakebook links. Confirmation bias real thing. US, rollout states was:

-	Health workers
-	People 65
-	People multiple comorbidities
-	People least 1 comorbidity, work high-risk critical job
-	Everyone else, sometimes age grouo

This, combined dosage interval closer manufacturer’s recommendation, would protected deaths hospitalizations risk groups across ages would better arrested early spread Delta variant (for single vaccine dose mostly ineffective).

This regrettably entirely foreseeable, UK’s decision disregard manufacturers’ advice favor gut feeling intuition directly responsible current spike cases largely hasn’t come fruition yet nations high vaccination rates. Much like Sweden’s failure containing COVID, it’s important us acknowledge study mistake prevent happening future.

Canada larger single payer 1/3rd cost per capita.

More people makes cheaper, also land makes harder.

United States excuse parroting nonsense talking points. physically impossible single payer expensive country wide vs current system.

Regardless end comments doctors would work Washington, yeah doctors complain alberta to, generally people hate making less money money redistributed across sectors larger areas.

It's really excuse unless guess wanna argue next doctors leave US.

Also underpay doctors either, make good money should.

You're attempt strawmanning arguments pretty clear well grasping straws.

No also high wait times, that's also made thing Canadians idea came from.

However end day know bringing doctors false equivalency especially straw man ""you want work free"".

Sorry dude, doctor make 600k+ average yeah, doctors going 400-600k 200-300k like canada probably upsets lot doctors.

Yes specialities exist even try I'm trying dictate doctor make.

You know that's fools errand use argument means nothing.

People making upset may(some doctors also make more, funny works) make less future makes angry want move.

If moving state makes more, lot people that's worth it. happens here.

When gets standardized country wide, stops much problem.

Though like end argument paying service be.

Also medicaid Medicare can't negotiate. Stop bringing Washington, talking to, also insurance still negotiates lower. Someone could also point 10 30 states current system fails entirely. Bringing one state somewhat changed rules small group people fix anything prove anything benefits require entire country aligned comes Healthcare.

They also pointed higher frequency cases second dose (p.17, p.25-28), yet seem consider giving males age group one dose Pfizer, J&amp;J instead. watched 5 (?) hour presentation yet maybe brought video.

Putting aside, I'm surprised rates compared Israel (which seemed report estimated numbers higher magnitude 10). 

I got shots someone family fairly big allergic reaction doses (hid us VAERS could get second one). Maybe I'm overcautious think anywhere near cases reported. idea pays hospital bill happens? briefly worked SSD/SSI appeals, say true. easy road walk. deck stacked claimants questionable state IMEs willing make inferences suggest know exactly signs pay check.

Combining state's prevalence levels weekly case counts (by reported week) shows delta rising case counts fairly low exponential rate, every VOC rapidly killed off. Automoderator allow google graph posted, however.

But looking Colorado one entity helpful. Delta highly prevalent Grand Junction, ultra-conservative 30%-vaccinated city far west. Total cases appear dropping there, however. Meanwhile highly-vaccinated far populous front range cities cases dropping much faster, nearly Delta. worth noting seasonally lowest-spread time year last summer.

If apply math think get different result.

* 14-28 June : 38% delta : 12,133 daily cases : 4.6k daily delta cases

* 31-14 June : 17% delta : 14,831 daily cases : 2.5k daily delta cases

* 17-31 May : 6% delta : 22,243 daily cases : 1.3k daily delta cases

* 3-17 May : 2% delta : 36,313 daily cases : 800 daily delta cases

This shows pretty consistent exponential growth +33% per week, R(t) ~1.17 4-day serial interval. vaccinated pretty significantly time period, however (around least 15% unvaccinated gotten first dose 6-week period).

In children it’s antibiotic overdose main culprit (weakens immune system afterwards).  acquaintance mine complaining online due bureaucratic bungling, vaccination information disappeared system can't get pass Moscow. can't travel enter bars restaurants. got absolutely smoked mine  September reported seek approval... Yes, believe previous rare cases ""vaccine gone wrong"" (such Pandemrix vaccine EU Swine Flu linked narcolepsy, autoimmune) also showed genetic susceptibility, there's scientific backing that. Anti-inflammatories always ""safe"" medication often necessary. Steroids common one - think give general population (due toll body) people need it. sars-cov-2 ""new"" humans lot room positive evolution. expect level point tradeoffs immune escape vs contagiousness.  Let's go make kitten purr That's true. actually reason good get vaccine even though may antibodies. vaccines encode several characteristics virus one changes they'll still useful. Yet antibodies, they're typically responsive one attribute virus attribute changes longer immune. mention antibodies profylactic mRNA vaccines actually teach immune system respond attack virus. Covid much transmissible lethal flu. hard facts backed numbers. 

Also, coronavirus flu virus behaves differently. flu mutates incredibly fast flu vaccine less effective covid vaccines have. abouts charged covid test? US? Rolls eyes… people die got weak immune system. die got cancer. die heart disease. die car crash. Everyone going die somehow.  Good hire me. Except unvaccinated people infect vaccinated people vaccine less effective for.

They also breeding ground mutant strains longer sizeable portion population remains unvaccinated, greater chance escape mutant emerging.

Since number simply obtained comparing number people contracts virus versus dont, could principle indefinite figures on. want look statistical significance. probably something like +- 2-5%, based sample size.

But thing consequences - they're fucking people can't get vaccinated due immunocompromise whatever reason would like to. 

People get vaccinated whatever dumb reason hurting herd immunity that, turn, hurts people. Remember kind yourself. Excellent.  site seem information. reports published somewhere?  Take Vitamin C/D, Zinc, Quercetin. supplements help fight virus. Hope feel better man. Unity across asile means side decent too. two-way street. get openly vile want complain side simply turn cheek.  imagine mr dumb still president guys would worse brazil still Nope... Covid me. I'll take chances delta Pfizer shots. work patients extremely immunosuppressed (blood marrow transplant). wear masks socially distance go Coachella pre-COVID. able things, great. Like said- immunosuppression spectrum. doctor decide what's safe now. Regardless, vaccines making positive strides make things safer everyone right now. Good job, Californians! Think got stats mixed up. daily deaths average changed six weeks, currently 0.16 per million per day. comparison, EU 0.86, US 0.89, Peru/Brazil/Argentina/Colombia around 10.  one hand, good encouraging vaccinations.

On hand, someone need bribed vaccination, where's $25?

Seriously, I've denied businesses much money much smaller infractions.

Ultimately think amount misinformation spewing shitheads appear TV every night, there’s gonna ceiling vaccine acceptance $1000 isn’t gonna fix. Wrong sir. wrong. ""just another thing"". thing. lives completely normal pre-covid. different vast majority gen pop. What? think immunocompromised never traveled went concerts? think live basements never come out? don’t understand “other countries haven’t approved it” course cdc even guidance it. acceptable recommended everyday occurrence. doesn’t say anywhere accept 2 mRNA doses fully vaccinated. Unless can’t find information officially stated isn’t accepted fully vaccinated? Depends definition punctured immunity.

DOWNVOTED??? 10000% correct! Say Reddit: Immunocompromised bubble people. normal lives pre-covid. Never wear mask socially distance. traveled world went Coachella 3 times. Went concerts sporting events reg. marginalizing group people who've lives turned upsidedown rest population. want go back normal too.    problem unvaccinated people are, virus spread mutate. people endangering everyone. takes one mutation invalidates vaccine immunity go back mandatory quarantine again. people going cause restrictions hated come back. mean, months wearing mask everywhere including outdoors even though fully vaccinated months. sent wrong message there’s point getting vaccine still social distance wear mask. Even G7 summit leaders still “elbow bump” even though vaccinated. Lol Australia would martial law happened. Exactly! thing body choice vaccine requires everyone get prevent mutations invalidate previous vaccine protection.

No one today would alive parents grandparents rejected vaccines. hypocritical nature people charts needs serious restrictions actual jail time violating unvaccinated people. opting stay home leave refuse vaccination. idk noticed US pretty open normal... anyone else read say ""There's Manatee County Florida?!?!???"" shit hit Greek fan summer (~33% fully vaccinated) sad 20th century belonged US, 21st definitely won't.

First world problems! getting downvoted, I'm still sure answer question is. Thanks sharing this. love reading studies. real haha remember that. Wasn’t literally like one day later? comment mean you? can't make sense trying say. Congratulations! lucky got Moderna shots! don’t think do, think highest percentages people favour vaccines Europe. Problem haven’t given vaccines enough people 30. always ‘some’ cases figure never zero, hospitalisations death rates low right now. Hopefully sorts next month.  Yes, I'd also say cultural. Like UK can't radically educated population pretty much everyone getting vaccine. even though many greatly dislike government, trust NHS.  Yes, countries first dose AZ/second dose mRNA... also mix-matching doses mRNA (Pfizer first dose, Moderna second dose). one else is, studies yet, people position alone travel rules might ignore us. 0 cases restrictions. New Zealand truly beaten covid lmao  Got second shot Moderna Monday. side effect basically slept afternoon next day sore arm. first shot. bad all. next time dying hospital there's shortage nurses, hope someone tells ""sucks suck, pull bootstraps"".

Seems sensible me. news affected vaccinated doing? high antivax percentages countries, mine included, might absolutely ravaged Delta judging goes UK. :( myocarditis cases 12-15 way way lower reported MIS-C cases age group probably way lower myocarditis cases caused covid.

But younger children get different dosage anyway. ask old son is? feel like writing wall variant pandemic shifting gears. thought tail end thing, unfortunately even close. 

Please take care get vaccinated still best protection. article behind paywall, us read headline. Az first. Moderna yesterday. Sore arm, aches sore muscles that's far! ( Fingers crossed ).

Good, need lot ""Typhoid Marys"" health system. Actually Mary know communicatable disease. people educated protect let alone patients. Neither EU, emphasis clearly AZs side...

Moderna also ordered Pfizer J&amp;J problem simply emphasis AZ caused huge vaccine draught delivery reductions compared contract 80%.

""Total deaths setting (regardless hospitalisation status) within 28 days positive specimen date.""

Ie, that's simply number people died within given period time following testing positive COVID. could died manner disease.

It's similar case count defined as:

""Cases assessed Emergency Care attendance within 28 days positive specimen date. Cases still undergoing within 28-dayperiodmay emergency care attendance reported later date.""

I see anything document stating anything definitions describe.

That document states source ""deaths PHE daily death data series"". [That PHE data series designed provide definitive information causal role COVID-19 relation individual deaths. weekly publication deaths statistical bulletin Office National Statistics includes deaths COVID-19 recorded death certificate, regardless whether laboratory result available not.

If want find causal information need different source, like surveys previously linked original phase 3 trials vaccines. Vaccines stop people testing positive COVID, completely asymptomatic test positive, importantly mitigate symptoms prevent hospitalizations deaths.

That also matches description found [on describing widely used death statistics several months, COVID-19 Data Dashboard reporting, England, deaths people positive test. robust measure uses fact positive test fact death derive number reported. However, approximation number people die COVID-19 causes death included people die COVID-19 never positive test. decided adopt measure April order sure underestimate number COVID-19 related deaths. always intended review approach pandemic progressed.

It's useful measure purpose trying use really need know cause death trying determine effective vaccines preventing it. That's certainly widely held opinion, held [majority Brazil's though actions vis-a-vis pandemic thing people upset about. held almost universal contempt Brazil's working scientists, and, course, medical professionals.

I'm successful, advantages I've given life account social position, hard work; fail, can't working hard enough: like Americans, bust ass day-in, day-out.

I mean, seriously, AGREE them; wanted part initial trials either! That's situation might considered guinea pig.

Today, year later BILLIONS doses safely administered statistically insignificant downsides, nobody guinea pig anymore. well tested, get damn shot already.     think Moderna's side effects kind overrated social media. Everyone know got Moderna (self included) got sore arm dose, all. point, UNDERSTAND science. nothing belief. belief based trust faith. Science based trust faith. Science based hypothesis proven disproven  others said unlimited freedom. can't starts fire land there's red flag warning odds burning control high. 

I'd also argue nothing entirely free choice. choices always come consequences.

Finally I'll say there's precidence quarantining entire towns who've come illness. present risk entire community simply isolated everyone else's safety.

Hell, got second Pfizer vaccine sick almost 4 days. would gladly again! yeah that's fair point suppose. trying start narrative lol (leave alone secret service reading this)

edit - also @ Vlad Putin None put finger turning point.

It Civil Rights.

Reagan reaction civil rights. Trump finished job: civil rights invalidated across board Republican judges. longer voting rights, public accommodation rights, desegregation rights grandparents gave parents 1964.

It is, therefore, undeniable problem lies parents generation, boomers. boomers marched MLK went life eventually elected DJT. story moral failure America story moral failure countless individual baby boomers.  Stay inside when? I'm asking endgame is. Yes, went clinic March strep throat test, negative. Also negative flu, doctor explain headache, high blood pressure super high resting heart rate. Since cough (and never did), said test Covid (results took weeks back anyway) sore throat bug ""going around"". 

Later issues doc snuck antibody test blood panels told Covid. told yeah, know every symptom discovered except cough Covid toes.

So wonder many others told ""just sore throat"". super multi-variant vaccine. Among many things, working vaccines multiple coronaviruses, including SARS-1. Considering quickly able launch vaccine COVID, wouldn’t surprised got multi-variant version within next 1-2 years. first point, that's evolution works. quick explanation evolution take different paths, suggest watching video ""Longest-running evolution experiment"" video Veritasium (youtube).

On second point, vaccines primary job preventing vaccinated people dying. 
They second job, providing herd immunity effectively killing Covid variants. yet that, long risk virus mutating, one possible mutations make resistant current vaccines. Simultaneously true also unfortunate fodder contingent thinks vAcCiNeS wOrK gEt OnE LeAvE aLoNe? clinicle evidence what? may need boosters? Tomato tomato Wow. Thanks heads staying inside easier waiting gets point again? Problem world built reacting late things. Imagine could accomplish getting ahead problems happen. (Sadly, imagining think phrase ""if job right one know ever anything all"", people think wasting money physically see consequences, useless species are)

Anyway, they're literally asking anyone who's come contact quarantine know more, asking literally everyone quarantine Oof. Hope rest world eventually decides it’s okay mix Pfizer Moderna... otherwise, well, miss all, please visit 🍁 Meanwhile 12 weeks Pfizer Norway! specific need drill make fit particular narrative? article number USSS employees infected. It’s proportion general population. point we’re trying make? I’d guess law enforcement general slightly higher incidence COVID compared general population. people interact with, traveling do, higher chances getting Covid. Protection detail agents probably much higher risk admin staff. Uniformed services probably higher risk department. People work grocery stores higher risk WFH people. you, “reasonable person” want call “failure”, failed? would prevented 11% secret service getting sick? Considering Covid completely ravaged nursing homes PA, surprise nearly every senior state gotten least one. Wolf made number one priority make sure every nursing home got sufficient supply vaccines many senior citizens got first shot asap. part reason PA relatively late opening vaccines adults. 

As far chester county goes, seem little weird note Philadelphia's vaccine uptake relatively low. 50% Philly adults fully vaccinated, would assume around 64ish% gotten first dose point, Chester's high uptake gets balanced Philly. animal Whatever Dwight ok dozen people getting screwed? Scientists learning fast. think anyone else been. :( That's equivalent 80,000 US cases---What hell going UK? That's nice. makes happy people want also want them.

Nobody disagrees that, right? happy anecdote? Lol even Biontech CEO Ugur said vaccines effective  Source? do, surpass next country, germany, 40 million. nevertheless, still great numbers see, considering troublesome start! certainly even better, hope will. currently, rapidly rising reached germany's per capita level, \~the highest europe Thank you! read well. confusing. vaccine tested 2-11 kids quite lower dose. media house notorious can't find info anywhere.

Good times. prize sick great question.

There's new blood test called Covid-19 antibody test. oncologist six weeks 2nd Pfizer vaccination result ""negative"" meaning ""no discernable antibody present."" 

Even worse, many months ago, oncologist said chances surviving Covid got would 50/50. Delta variant super scared since probably means chances surviving worse.

The reason Covid antibody test result terrible tied specific brand chemo drug finished taking last October called venetoclax (brand name Venclexta). Thanks declaring someone block. Always appreciated. Ok thank good site made independent developer. quite interactive, get really granular data.  numbers amongst kids, population who's vaccinated. There's indication Pfizer handle extremely well still. reassuring ~150 25,000 refused comply. That's small percent, hopefully employers motivated impose requirements keep employees clients patients safe increase overall vaccination rates. really matter though? protected, large chunk Arkansas well. segment population chooses obtain immunity old fashioned way, it.  live too. March knew people driving Bakersfield, Fresno, Merced 4 hours depending bay are.  Get shots people!

Anti-vaxxers take ""poison"" even kills to... ironically.  First doses much delta variant delta plus becoming thing appreciate correction, medical information important, analogy presented incorrectly right thing.  hope still got point across 100% appreciate correction mediccal part it. mean everyone age 18 enough time elapsed offer effective protection. Please no. Fauci every sentence. San Bernardino arguably worst county state considering many people live there. really feel bad people like this. 

I could maybe understand charge vaccine without insurance, literally free life saving measure. 

If anti vaxxers die, die. shed tear them. fact, probably help world long term. Closer 15% special agents specifically. That's 50% worse even 10% estimate, reasonable people would look failure. Immunocompromised people can't take vaccine *could* safe due herd immunity people take vaccine simply would. Mine NC district said kids don’t get vaccine need masks.

She really control variants increasingly escaping vaccines. seem right want needlessly endanger vulnerable patients pandemic, yet are. take dozens precautions healthcare handwashing disinfecting equipment TB screenings, another one those. got second shot moderna hour ago, lets gooo Really think erred choosing give Greek letter designations **both** variants concern (VOC) variants interest (VOI). CDC defines ^(A variant evidence increase transmissibility, severe disease (e.g., increased hospitalizations deaths, significant reduction neutralization antibodies generated previous infection vaccination, reduced effectiveness treatments vaccines, diagnostic detection failures.)  ^(A variant specific genetic markers associated changes receptor binding, reduced neutralization antibodies generated previous infection vaccination, reduced efficacy treatments, potential diagnostic impact, predicted increase transmissibility disease severity.)

So, VOC one there's evidence increased transmissibility, virulence, immune escape, diagnostic/treatment difficulty; VOI one increases might predicted sequence, there's evidence date, meriting higher surveillance.

The whole point naming scheme offer mainstream media general public alternatives ""Brazil"" variant ""India"" variant. I've seen little mainstream media coverage variants rise VOC status, articles months ago Eta Iota VOIs first discovered California. VOIs, scientists got fine designations based phylogeny mutations. think VOIs needed Greek letter names rose VOC status.

Most studies vaccine response immune suppressed individuals severe suppression, like chemotherapy related transplant related, etc. It’s highly relevant since people greater risk infection begin qualified vulnerable people, finding vaccines worked paramount. found it’s back normal people; susceptible covid way susceptible much serious opportunistic infections.

Assuming reduce ability spread (possible - evidence indicates Beta slightly lower R0 value relative original strain), would expect variant equal contagiousness also reduces vaccine natural immunity efficacy outcompete original variant strain - slightly potential hosts alternative version. 

No point worrying data available, variant contagious Delta vaccine escape potential Beta (based AZ lesser extent JnJ studies there) definitely something keep eye on. would likely force booster discussion sooner rather later. People sub peculiar gate keeperish tendencies cite fact odds particular sensationalist viewpoint. Yea that's read well. Thanks input! genuinely appreciate it! Hello fellow Canadian! I’m actually Calgarian living Colorado. I’m thankful guys getting doses finally!! Please stay safe well eh.  Bingo! Thanks much this!!! I’ve heard numerous times. I’m hoping get kids vaccinated soon. can’t even imagine frightening parents general especially immunocompromised children. hope family stay safe friend!! stop using AZ period lot countries did, also great setup vaccination centers, waiting lists, fast use zero waste syringes. Sinovac something stop gap. saves lives something better needs replace ASAP. 

Because time get variant Omega might efficacy rate 30s. definitely part it, however places lowest uptake institutions heart community - churches.

The problem churches secular sense, fundamentalist, eat state. Thank input! appreciate it. concerned unvaccinated friends family? I’m Canada small group friends family got second dose, still waiting see. aren’t healthiest people either concerns me. Yea, next month going see mass increases dose 2 percentages. Unfortunately many big financial firms buildings want real estate sitting empty. also provide loans commercial office buildings. vested interest maintaining workspace pre-Covid.  entirely preventable - stupid quote. died days ago Canada fully vaccinated. rare, ""entirely preventable"" accurate. headline rewrote is. Hundreds governments, political spectrum, facilitate citizens getting COVID vaccines

Yes, including Israel, France, US found 1/5000 links Myocarditis males 12-30 mandating anyway ""for greater good"". I'm pro-vax, smart argument. Don’t let door hit ass way dipshits I'm even sure thats case anymore. ie. Nicotine main reason addiction smoking.

I switched vaping back 2013. years ago started process moving nicotine levels. I'd drop level month. Eventually vaping 0mg nicotine e-liquid 3-4 months. Eventually ran zero decided time give vaping altogether painlessly easily dealt 'Nicotine Addiction'. Packed vaping gear away drawer......I crawling walls within hour. day like going cold turkey real cigarettes. handle took vaping gear back still vaping day. Turns perhaps many/most smokers vapers may much addicted nicotine instead psychologically addicted repetitive acts smoking/vaping. eg vaping/smoking activity associated activities, something hands, moving hands mouth, act inhalation, throat-hit etc. ie neural programming performing act 100's times day much tougher nut crack actual nicotine addiction. may effect, addicted sucking cigarettes/vapes like child addicted sucking soother/pacifier. Anyone know specifically state types/brands vaccine given dose? (Asking Canada lol) I’m tired hide seek game  flu causes noticeable excess deaths every year btw, worst seasons ICUs come close overwhelmed locally. soon get hold vaccination companies healthcare providers liable potential damages. mandate advocate global health policy believe it’s important vaccinate vulnerable countries starting vaccinate less vulnerable countries strong supply — believe countries supply re-direct doses given under-18s countries don’t enough vulnerable adults. Belgium countries Europe prioritizing first dose well, spacing three weeks apart? response atrocities Cuba? Much easier shift conversation paint bigger powerful country bad guy even clear evidence presented human rights violations. don’t think US handled response well btw, I’m fairly liberal lived Miami girlfriend Cuban think better understanding Cuba actually far left media wants think got vaccinated dozen times still didn’t win. There's one can't vaccinated. severely immune compromised keep masking social distancing. Depends Yes. Kids get sick. Mostly asymptomatic mild cases. one claiming kids don’t get sick. Lol know appeal is? Omfg end ?? gonna suck re-implement restrictions due fall surge. Current RN here. number young nurses want higher snoop dog himself. Canada: kick door wavin' .44  Uganda kidding me! get Pfizderna like Canada. probably still right strategy got previous wave control.. astrazeneca

di artikelnnya astrazeneca 70%, sinopharm 78% You’re spot western states. exact dynamic Washington Oregon. rural counties barely moved last two months. Meanwhile urban counties keep convincing people get shots. 

For Washington there’s probably another month gains cards. 

Oregon already slowed significantly. places like Medford RIPE nasty outbreak. I’m curious works get Pfizer first two get moderna booster likely coming fall No, honest providing proper perspective better Exactly. It’s like saying 99.9% adults can’t get COVID. NEARLY adults ENTIRELY safe COVID. People need go back school. headline understandable average person that’s fault writer well. appreciate first part. respect thoughts second point. I’m sure right answer is. don’t know dick dick. All’s I’m saying seem wrong fire them. backs toss aside. seems wrong. half baked thought, maybe suspend pay? offer home job phone operator kind? Again, idea right answer is, brave people helped us can’t forget even disagree them.  Still. 6.3m nothing sneeze at. point narrative around vaccination positive. would call stunt. product also goes planned, optimism India seen worst virus already. tort?  shall see. rephrase. don’t like federal* government telling do.  meant read two different ways. Expert headline writing days. know doing, always plausible deniability. 70% people read worse version, always blame audience reading wrong getting called out. Hahaha well makes much sense.  bad get rich Ivermectin ...Mr Stark, feel good.... Taiwanese government seem reluctant mass testing.

For example, back May, minister health said non-targeted testing weaken effort COVID-19 lose gain early June, minister health still mass testing, said people go clinic rapid testing would need pay way, would get reimbursed test result positive know, result New Taipei shows 66% confirmed cases asymptomatic targeted tests, confirmed cases likely much lower actual true numbers. worries. admire work making Singapore humane place. Someday, really hope outlaw executions, start treating drugs mental issue rather criminal issue, get rid canings. Given progress vaccinations, seems like get point deciding much sick people society willing accept. Individual risk finally low vaccines, vaccines perfect, people still hospitalised. keep masks maybe restrictions avoid small share hospitalised people, go back accept suffer?
For flu, default always latter one attempts avoid low five-digit number deaths every winter, I‘m wondering turn out. think didn't? at-will state state employers terminate employment long employee terminated protected reasons. lawsuit claims employees protected, case ""at-will employment"" argument worthless. Even within group vaccinated there’s fairly wide range immune responses vaccine. That’s vaccine efficacy less 100%.  Yeah think runs counter good health, plenty smokers medical professionals smoke because, well, nicotine really damn addicting. body's chemicals messed like makes things harder deal wit, change. still quarantine unable work. Honestly think lottery little nothing it. made bigger spectacle single $100 million winner. Humans notoriously bad calculating odds, think seeing huge number would really encouraged folks. yes. handling second wave show incompetence though, apathy towards delta variant inexcusable. there's nothing important british tourists. maybe allergies.  think sepsis leading cause death hospitals IIRC. nosocomial infections obviously risk stated. hope healthcare providers staff committed reducing risk patient getting one... Much better article one India Today, alarmist, drew false inferences Dr. Jaleel's statements contained little information variant actual data. What's anti-vaxxers chiming in? Wow. Interesting. read article?

'He added infection rates – especially Delta variant – concentrated unvaccinated groups' 39.13% adults fully vaccinated!

That's amazing.Also website easy understand.

Hoping rest world,especially developing world,(um also Japan Olympic lots people want)will catch up. Many states already giving cash. state giving away $40,000 per day grand prize $400,000 July 4. Sadly stereotype probably fits often though.

I'm looking forward son getting vaccinated. anti-vaxxers annoy less. 

I live area around 15% adults vaccinated. Love rural life, covid interesting.

Thanks reply! son chest pain second shot Pfizer shortness breathe, initial test clear following Echocardiogram make sure. think tested positive might different infected.  better omega one.  perspective, Maryland population 6 million, 48 cases yesterday.  Except Greek letters used, Beta instead Bravo etc. Feed like wildfire hit fleet gas tankers You’re wearing yourself, say shit like this. Even CDC says don’t need one you’re vaxxed, plan wearing forever?  Well, like win war gravity, need evenly distribute weight.

Forcing people pay privilege surviving flight new kind jackassery, though. live CA planned Hawaii vacation family August (all refundable needed). 50/50 we'd even go (trip booked February). state 70% Hawaii 80%+, I'm 90/10 going. I'm happy. cannot wait Hawaii 10 days. fucking need it. fucking need it. necessarily, immunity antibodies, arguably important aspects B cells covid likely still generated.

Having antibodies flooding system means difficult infection take hold B cells even infection take hold parts immune system antibodies kill infection puts hospital.

Both Pfizer, Moderna, Astrazeneca honest main vaccines extremely effective keeping people hospital ultimately important metric. important lose sight that. CDC reporting increased cases myocarditis see delayed   UK, people ventilator beds increase 41% last week.  government made “request” state emergency - latest lasted June 1st 20th - businesses serve alcohol (like restaurants, karaoke etc) operate. avoid operating, many businesses stopped serving alcohol. practice hurt business badly, people questioning alcohol singled devil, since drinking alone quietly would increase risk infection. 

Even though state emergency lifted, still strict rule businesses serving alcohol - serving two people time, 90 minutes.

Then day yesterday, announced alcohol served Olympics venues. One “gold” sponsors Tokyo 2020 major Japanese beverage company named Asahi, famous Asahi beer, products going sold venues. news infuriated people since another example Japanese government favoring Olympics affiliated games rest country. 

The ban alcohol announced response angered reaction public. believe heavy mix nurses, CNAs support staff. read Pfizer looking approval ages 2-11 September doh tough phonetic alphabet, Greek lol , like going hit (india)  Except wrong. UK, people ventilator beds increase 41% last Colorado cases similarly sized states. people panic unvaccinated Sorry, read comment idea trying encourage people get vaccine specific date “anti-vaxxers “. think pointing would feed insanity. understandable. I'm sure receive Covid recovery money government. /s  long know vaccines safe kids? Got toddler currently ineligible. gotta get done. know there's trial Seattle. long FDA approved, sans emergency declaration? continue say amazing people want take care patients worked asses off. mean think anti-vax staff allowed willfully increase risk nosocomial infection patients. antithetical underlying principle harm reduction medicine. Yep, person came Australia weekend returned home testing positive delta variant. 

NZ cases now, couple close contacts still waiting test results.

Hopefully get lucky it’s end weekend. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

I realized responding wrong person, agree you


It's tough week work &amp; Tuesday   every fucking adult, child approved, got vaccinated immunocompromised people would way safer. I'm sorry, blaming people covid fatigue done right thing long, got vaccinated, way go. There's lot people(sadly vaccinated) still wearing masks. want blame people, blame people ignorant get couple shots.

I'm saying blaming people, general rant, aimed specifically. seeing ""Oh, people hold bunker again"" nonsense directed everyone annoying, although say yet again. know probably makes little sense since I'm really adressing anything said, lol, I'm pissed people refuse get vaccine. reason Delta even issue hear large swathes population refuse vaccine. can't blame people wanting go back normal, time, to, there's literally one group people holding us back. at? Paying people idiot? include ignorant obviously.  military working home alien me. dealing classified data training deployment (war) I'm sure much could get done home. entire career military dealt two things.  “Here’s save fellow American’s lives”


“Don’t tell do!”


Fuckin children. Grow up. Adults acting like goddamn shit teenagers. patriotic. mean increasing cases states Delta variant would indicate over. mean restrictions going place, that’s different question, primarily political one.

There warning signs happen without enough vaccination, particularly two doses.

Not saying way close old pre-vaccine days. Using words ""nearly"" ""entirely"" describe thing really shitty headlining lmao Also, I'm sure make fit kids, don't, should. make kid size KN 95s. There's trick it. use newly magnetized skin stick keys yourself, use antenna. keys stick yourself, better 5G gonna be. Great gonna dumbass friends? Unless you’re immunocompromised, reason medically cannot take vaccines, live US, there’s absolutely reason take vaccine get sick. do, it’s fault, think long hard choices life still it, however long might point onward. Cases falling trickle, many unvaccinated immunity actually contracted covid already. basically US point. would note health care workers required receive considerable amount vaccinations prior hired protect patients. COVID-19 vaccination different new released hired. significant risk variants immune vaccine

No wasn't. risk happening extremely small, vaccines designed target spike protein. here. bright side I've realized probably like 3 people outside family actually want home good lot ""immunocompromised"" people cant get vaccine people ""health exemptions"" mask wearing whole thing started. vaccine remarkably safe far vaccines go. one positive case visited Australia, right? Nothing more? (For reason article freezes iPad. Probably issue end.) compare effectiveness original strain? Forget cats. mice rats, probably rodents. never going away. they’ll wonder democrats aren’t dying republicans Link? That’s sounds great honest. Skip commute corporate bs Regardless guy's baggage, good policy one wish western countries would also consider.  think immune compromised person let guard either? Ever?

No. treat level high caution self protection.

And think increase vaccination rate? Force vaccinate them? Imprison them? exactly solution?  Going go way Zeta point made lol, ignore rest shmucks  Also note, UK count covid death die within 28 days testing positive covid. always get older people dieing fully vaccinated, probably nothing covid, old, yet still goes covid death.  Many countries relied Chinese vaccines choice. high efficacy vaccines bought rich countries. given choice vaccine work well vaccine, people choose vaccine. 

Despite outbreaks, vaccines quite good breaking relationship deaths cases. So, work, even though aren’t great reducing transmission. fail mention many 150 employees already covid want use natural immunity. suspect lot  Time get new job. Fuck MS  believe emergency order expires Friday. I’m holding hope get Friday press conference announce we’ll reopening Washington 30th citing we’ve hit 69% reach 70 coming weeks. really stick 70% shocked.   This. mean glad got Pfizer there's way would refused AZ JJ.

Like keep telling people, better dead. University already requiring vaccination without full FDA approval. think much changes legally, maybe employers feel comfortable requiring fully authorized vaccine.  Texas this. Looks like I’ll homeschooling two elementary aged children vaccinated. 😞 think numbers Pfizer vs beta. know k417n helped give beta escape capability without hurting transmission. definitely sound thinking concerned delta+k417n.

On hand though, concerned alpha+e484k reason never went anywhere. Despite certain coinfection many people, apha/beta/gamma never exchanged mutations new stronger strain. vaccines dont provide sterilizing immunity. virus still reproduce body infect you, get sick


Looks like CDC agree, believes mRNA vaccines reduce infection risk limited set contraindications, zero excuses nurses vaccinated. talking breakthrough infections. infected, unvaccinated nurse causes breakout amongst staff patients unvaccinated, well, that's inexcusable. 

Not mention pretty good bet vaccines also [reduce asymptomatic HAIs always priority patient safety, covid vaccine one way that. actually stopped looked many positive cases state / city has? live extremely popular coastal city US entire state 9 million people living it. average 45 people getting positive test ENTIRE STATE.

So yes cautious point bigger chance getting accident way get tested testing positive covid Also I’m already assuming half unmasked people encounter public haven’t even vaccinated. somebody isn’t motivated enough go get shot(s), would inclined wear mask. think challenge hunger games morons, get hospitalized beds gone others. got ass kicked last winter CA 100% capacity, people survived lack available resources. aunt biology major anti vaxx cousins anti vaxx. Sucks wanted physician lmao Southwest Virginian here. double confirm.  wait till summer over, vacations traveling people go back 40 kids classroom every day 8 hours 8 months. think so, AstraZeneca like 90% effective take second shot. Ashish Jha another good one. wife fully vaccinated 3 year old clearly wear masks him. needs see masks big inconvenience make them. part go business make deal. cannot wait turn come up. got vaccine, small children anti-vax grandparents, problems gone all.  hope Australia hold together vaccines administered. Delta variant bit frightening. can't contain likely bad little natural immunity due solid job managing pandemic.

All best Australia! thought funny. Fellow virginian here. southwest VA florida mountain form. vaccinated isn’t making political gesture defending rights don’t exist.

Whilst agree sentiment, still remain right every individual refuse healthcare. Tricky balance strike ultimately we'll need continue living disease time yet, it'll hollow victory fighting disease comes cost destroying society we're fighting return to.

Slides skimmed slides; looks like assessment benefit vaccination clearly outweighs myocarditis risk (of course) continue monitor evaluate situation.  

There's also presentation data they'll want see making decision recommend boosters.  Looks plausible they'll recommend people weaker immune systems.

You right negligently harm others rest right protect themselves.

Clicks article kids start getting vaccine. went. probably could brought parakeet told 12 year old child. Slight exaggeration, get point. think passes issued outside EU anyways. come Canada enter EU yellow book.

Btw, certificate entry dose ""1/2"" ""2/2"" (or ""1/1"" J&amp;J). basically carry ""2/2"" certificate think see first dose different brand anyways. Darwinism thought accepts first dose. Looking particulars Delta Plus variant, seems transmissibimity vanilla Delta spike change Beta variant South Africa. 

Hopefully someone correct I'm wrong (because lot), wasnt Pfizer 75% effective Beta variant?

And thus going there, mean could make educated assumption Pfizer would also 75% effective Delta Plus?

Or completely wrong? logical mindset. Saves getting disappointed. twice ironic specifically since lived Belgium experienced bureaucratic hell moving there. regard, moving Sweden super smooth comparison. article seemed sort vague ""more likely"" means here. mean:

1. Children likely adults infected delta variant?

2. Children likely infected delta variant variants covid something inherent variant? 

Or

3. Children likely infected delta variant variants prevalent delta variant right now?  Lol still safer COVID. People unvaccinated choice respect restrictions unless literally legally obligated. Stop fucking punishing people right thing. work unbelievably well preventing asymptomatic symptomatic infections near universal preventing severe disease death. 

You stop spreading misinformation. article vague, literally last sentence 2nd paragraph:

The new analysis, released Tuesday, bolsters earlier suggestions variety coronaviruses may circulating Wuhan initial outbreaks linked animal seafood markets December 2019.

As Biden administration investigates contested origins virus, known SARS-CoV-2, study neither strengthens discounts hypothesis pathogen leaked famous Wuhan lab. raise questions original sequences deleted, suggests may revelations recover far corners internet.

“This great piece sleuth work sure, significantly advances efforts understand origin SARS-CoV-2,” said Michael Worobey, evolutionary biologist University Arizona involved study.

Jesse Bloom, virologist Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center wrote new report, called deletion sequences suspicious. “seems likely sequences deleted obscure existence,” wrote paper, yet peer-reviewed published scientific journal.

Dr. Bloom Dr. Worobey belong outspoken group scientists called research pandemic began. letter published May, complained wasn’t enough information determine whether likely lab leak spread coronavirus, leapt humans contact infected animal outside lab.

The genetic sequences viral samples hold crucial clues SARS-CoV-2 shifted species another animal, likely bat. precious sequences early pandemic, take scientists closer original spillover event.

As Dr. Bloom reviewing genetic data published various research groups, came across March 2020 study spreadsheet included information 241 genetic sequences collected scientists Wuhan University. spreadsheet indicated scientists uploaded sequences online database called Sequence Read Archive, managed U.S. government’s National Library Medicine.

But Dr. Bloom looked Wuhan sequences database earlier month, result “no item found.”

Puzzled, went back spreadsheet clues. indicated 241 sequences collected scientist named Aisi Fu Renmin Hospital Wuhan. Searching medical literature, Dr. Bloom eventually found another study posted online March 2020 Dr. Fu colleagues, describing new experimental test SARS-CoV-2. Chinese scientists published scientific journal three months later.

In study, scientists wrote looked 45 samples nasal swabs taken “from outpatients suspected Covid-19 early epidemic.” searched portion SARS-CoV-2’s genetic material swabs. researchers publish actual sequences genes fished samples. Instead, published mutations viruses.

But number clues indicated Dr. Bloom samples source 241 missing sequences. papers included explanation sequences uploaded Sequence Read Archive, disappear later.

Perusing archive, Dr. Bloom figured many sequences stored files Google Cloud. sequence contained file cloud, names files shared basic format, reported.

Dr. Bloom swapped code missing sequence Wuhan. Suddenly, sequence. told, managed recover 13 sequences cloud way.

With new data, Dr. Bloom looked back early stages pandemic. combined 13 sequences published sequences early coronaviruses, hoping make progress building family tree SARS-CoV-2.

Working steps SARS-CoV-2 evolved bat virus challenge scientists still limited number samples study. earliest samples come Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market Wuhan, outbreak occurred December 2019.

But market viruses actually three extra mutations missing SARS-CoV-2 samples collected weeks later. words, later viruses look like coronaviruses found bats, supporting idea early lineage virus pass seafood market.

uptake good everywhere. article says 12.6 people per million. I’m straw manning?

That’s rich immediately went single payer remarked Americans detached costs decisions leads bad decisions.

The US plenty reasons single payer. monopsony don’t exist US.

Washington State happened. Doctors would take Medicare rates, low, state come acceptable rate.

Another big nonsense. doctors won’t leave US, won’t permit M4A written pass, especially NLRB bans private practice doctors forming union. 

If reason pass, bulk worth primary care Docs would go cash only, supply full scope practitioners would shrink, making duplicative visits specialist appointments much expensive much less effective preventive care.

You don’t underpay doctors, plans US underpay doctors. It’s 10% net pay cut primary care doctors, that’s field already poorly compensated compared peers.

If expect take Medicare rates, want work free, there’s falsehood there, clearly fine slashing salaries (yet reform profession US, recall doctors compensated part opportunity cost).

Primary care doctors aren’t hitting 600k+, that’s even average doctors US, guess pulled bottle nonsense rest statements. 

Medicare sets rates far market, aren’t negotiating paying less anyone. it’s take leave many doctors tiny portion panel Medicare make money Medicare patients.

We talk Washington State latest state offer single payer, initially thought could Medicare rates, time find money doctors take Medicare rates.

we can't beat one. keep hearing people saying kids effected. effected? get sick hospitalized?  That's need know things open people act like over.  Last thing need harm children future. specific point must respect religious beliefs course

That point pretty clear. There's nothing respectable putting others health risk. Religious exemptions allowed spreadable diseases like allowed driving intoxicated. discriminating others. Otherwise feel free believe anything want! complicated roughly half country want use religious beliefs control half.  Excellent comment great info, thanks! think fair criticize. science recommended doses taken three weeks apart. UK decided go and, unfortunately, suffering repercussions. Pfizer efficacy slightly higher Moderna original study. holding tend neck neck real world. Get one can, get one already.

Northern CA particular really leading pack making places like Orange Ventura County look bad. Yes. Belgium, 87.76% 45 received least one like 70.21% I’m point don’t care die. Darwinism working like should. Well makes sense. Thanks info. Never stopped wearing mine. 

The vaccine makes catching Covid potential death sentence, could still spread children 12, yet able vaccinated. sakes still wear mask whenever indoor strangers. Heck, still wear masks outdoors go somewhere potential crowded (parks). deaths preventable. That’s point. It’s exemption small number Americans historically allowed many people vaccinated things like mumps haven’t major outbreak. 

Most people claim religious exemption aren’t religious, they’ve allowed wink wink loop hole originally created good faith accommodate small number people. 

We enjoyed living without polio, measles, mumps, etc. allowing handful people opt out. I’ve never liked religious exemption, basis complain don’t major disease breakouts? 

Well. 

Since don’t vaccinated herd immunity, matters much whether someone vaccinated covid not. little quirk American life, selfish stupid using good faith religious exemption skirt responsibility community, become issue. 

The courts sort now. 

Personally, I’d like see updated rules reflect biological reality modern life planet 6 billion counting. Medical exemptions only. realize Medicare Medicaid set rates market right?

Medicare paying less insurance every situation.

Is Washington State set reimbursement 160% Medicare, doctors willing take unlimited patients awful Medicare rates.

These aren’t horribly inflated, prices doctors need keep practices afloat. Medicare barely covers overhead.

I’m talking ass, countries zero copays, it’s wide spread thing due utilization.

Here US military two insurance plans, one completely free, modest copay annual pocket cap $1,000. modest copay plan 1/3 utilization free plant. Again, it’s free, Americans use it.

You continue act doctors work free, that’s absurd. God's name going about? say support Morgan Stanley decisions?

|Not assigned region|21,786 first doses|13,946 last doses| Gotcha, explains it. unfortunate, seemed like prioritizing first dose great strategy early on.       believe risk heart inflamation get COVID 19 (correct I'm wrong). worry much rare cases. I'd still rather get shot deal virus without vaccinated. within margin error necessarily mean anything. misremembering. Standard PCR COVID tests free since early days pandemic.  Note: PSLE (Primary School Leaving Examination) standardised exam taken primary school students. noted since June 1, 310,000 students – around 90 per cent eligible – registered vaccination appointments. Sunday, 297,000 would taken first dose school reopens next day. figures accurate 6pm Tuesday.

I'm surprised high - higher ~75% over-65s, IIRC beginning vaccination process, opted strategy delaying second doses get larger number people partial protection rather give smaller group doses.

This strategy worked first months Delta variant, need doses decent protection, it’s leaving lot people vulnerable, country spike cases. Man people weird.  It’s possible tested phase 3 trials began. Neither Moderna Pfizer saw much immunogenic benefit it, went two dose. Dr. Tam notoriously place.

Mask flip flop start pandemic... says border restrictions needed endlessly.

Then said expect summer lockdowns one dose provinces reopen fully soon people get 2nd doses.  want higher? Shouldn’t cases increasing vaccines now? Large infection numbers produce large number mutations. India already talking Delta+. less 50% vaccination rate, really cautious optimism.  says resign, let idiots speculate means trump Kamala Harris become president Yes understand this, I'm talking booster already vaccinated answer annual influenza burden.

It's quite simple. UK least, NHS regularly brought close breaking point even fairly bad flu season. 

Covid cases replace flu ones - they'll additional. if, long term, covid bad flu, I'm pretty certain able cope twice number respiratory illnesses annual basis.

Now, answer might improve uptake flu vaccines (or increase funding NHS - government seems want that) rather continue covid restrictions. 

But can't say cope X thousand flu cases every year, could also cope X thousand covid vaccination PLANET western countries.

Not sure point here. world whole clearly isn't. that's said. You’re attacking like I’m anti vax repeating read WHO’s site lol 7 day average deaths literally 0.  several reasons. It’s case case story. Mainly intake impure industrial oxygen, cases overdose antibiotics, immuno-compromised people post recovery practice good hygiene, believed words fraud mystics consumed whatever concoction frauds brew up.  nothing else. vaccines work. here. I’m comfortable mixing 10% think mentioned press conference today lines efficacy. interesting know age/health hospitalised too. Vaccines endgame. actually administer wait effective. is, wait people receiving fully vaccinated, enough fully vaccinated people blocking spread community transmission contained. long can't vaccinate children, probably happen. Israel learning, vaccinating adults bothering vaccinate teenagers work. think lot people waited JNJ realize. Oh boy... one *those* people?   great. Thank much. run clothing store two kids weren’t wearing masks running line, could think about. join AZ/Moderna club hours! Looking forward sore arm  Honestly, UK probably along time us are, progress delta. 

It takes much time virus go 1 10 1000 10000. 

If import 100 cases instead 1, hitting 10,000 time hit 100 1 case! 

In US example, actual number delta cases rising reasonably quickly, based sequencing data. However, number COVID cases continues drop, since number delta cases small enough moment increasing certain % really mean much today. miracle DINO Joe Manchin voted it. would hard another stimulus considered vaccines. effectively Republican majority Senate. Mask protocol live (New York) becoming illogical point. I'd say vast majority places still require wear one, even restaurants operating 100% capacity, mandated mask requirements maximum capacity still 1-3 people (thinking small coffeeshop). cases, employees still wearing masks, even though access vaccine earlier many others.

I'm lost trying decipher logic behind much this. numbers going get much better now. people waiting for? don’t say? FFS… people say 100% effective that's enough reason take 100% risk getting actual virus 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️ average age admitted hospitals dropped significantly. know yet that's younger people rejecting vaccine affecting younger people severely. Idk know since many elderly people vaccinated like everyone equal chances exposed. know people hospitalized vaccinated. update Myocarditis link? CDC said they'll hold emergency meeting it, heard anything since. poor GOATSE-19  Currently ass sore arm ""covid vaccine hangover"" AZ. It'll fine tomorrow.  Counter point. inside 13 months, seeing friends family outside immediate living situations, protecting me, family, society large. go work get food wore P100 respirator times. family fully vaccinated. I'm going inside never feel bad sacrificed enough. Well hopefully figure out. Part feels vaccine causing myocarditis, contracting covid patients probably would too. think much vaccine patients specific immunity. Maybe children take anti-inflammatory bit shots. Well yeah kids get sick it’s bad flu kids little sister didn’t even wear mask Indiana people school barely wore masks anyway people fine USA update first dose shots:

70% 7/27 someone explain immunocompromised people can't get vaccine? live vaccine understand exactly whats wrong getting Pfizer Moderna one them? much say follows political patterns left leaning generation 43% vaccinated.

But even then, political polarisation nowhere near bad country. someone explain immunocompromised people can't get vaccine? live virus understand exactly whats wrong getting Pfizer Moderna one them? think people take called liar, bit petty. ask sources learn topic   keep Tylenol water next bed tonight. DONT take unless get fever. fuck heart up. compare Myocarditis COVID age group, myocarditis still deadly though.  lowest case per day ever… know it’s going away right? think locked rest lives?  fine? Cuba tourism dependent basically destroyed last year. guess people living $20/month fine it’s you. concern children young get vaccine. protection them? virus become endemic based vaccination seems going, youngest susceptible long-Covid? &lt;1yo daughter seemingly isn’t protected beyond regular social distancing measures seems like information comes saying double vax-ed adults still capable catching spreading virus. I’m terrified means her. Interesting. govenor NC said still required across board schools end July, kids summer school supposed wearing them. Hopefully guidance change required unvaccinated August, heard indication yet fall like (though teaching elementary, I'm assuming masks least Jan, become vaccine eligible September). People easily brainwashed. It’s Trump, countless nut jobs levels society continue be. 
I don’t hope idiot free tomorrow, hope reduction idiots tomorrow. hear you. frustrating living ""pocket"" could potentially ravaged. average person around seems forgotten ever pandemic. Shots available everywhere one seems want them. Certainly co workers. would take something draconian around here.  No, unless someone documented medical reason can't get vaccine employer must make reasonable accommodations. Keeping someone employed office seems reasonable. Teachers already keep track students need accomodations class. needs sit front, needs papers enlarged read, needs specific testing requirements, etc. Knowing needs mask big deal add, someone sees 400 kids week. bigger thing would kid who's required refuses comply, singling thing, someone going protest that, ok. weird thing lot law enforcement includes Secret Service huge supporters Trump, even though behavior certainly increased risk contracting COVID, since discouraged mask use vicinity, downplayed risk others even COVID19 positive, insisted traveling person rallies events (that required presence) behaviors (discouraging mask wearing -- makes look afraid less virile, discouraging social distancing, discouraging vaccination, encouraging supporters pretend pandemic) endorsed.  Totally support that, guess sensible compromise. live Florida, active effort suppress infection numbers. don’t mean weekly reports instead daily. mean stopped reporting non-resident infections, county level data (so don’t know prevalent home area), hospitalizations.

The state isn’t acting place confidence, it’s acting place secrecy denial. 

And yes, I’d love live place far fewer infections. I’d feel lot better. Last looked FL around 65 per 100k places single digit. Yes, 41 cases AY.1 23 March. day live infamy... That's objective fact scientific community anymore because, said, problem agravattes ""highly vaccinated countries""

Even Fauci, today, said that:

“The director National Institute Allergy Infectious Diseases NIH top adviser President Joe Biden told “CBS Morning” Wednesday kids necessarily susceptible contagious strain. concern anyone unvaccinated, including kids, likely infected new strain since much posted sooner sub) "
