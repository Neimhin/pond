We're agreement realize (but total agreement). 

New variants happen ""always"" happen. happen virus allowed proliferate. Vaccines prevent proliferation. Vaccines prevent new variants.

I agree vaccinated world fast enough and/or maintained adequate social distancing longer, maybe Delta happened. clear: vaccine create Delta. want go back Dallas Symphony, governor banned vaccine mandates.

Comply people constantly steal lie us. hope slippery slope doesnt come this.  Scott Gottleib explained detail days ago. Thanks reminding us. seems idea vaccination get rid Covid completely, happening unless virus changes. possible buyers source ""breakthrough infections?""  Florida keeps bouncing along one every 1000 residents testing positive, every day. ones actually getting tested.

Please, get vaccinated wear mask ! Totally anecdotal, cousin 25 26 positive symptoms fully vaxxed least months. pretty surprised hear it. She’s terribly ill, doesn’t feel great. I’m surprised haven’t breakthrough infection point I’ve resumed life fully. Craziness. nice There's lot desperate people definitely will. what’s different way Israel everywhere else? thing that’s come mind whole time whenever subject raised refused vaccinate Palestinians first. bright side someone stupid tasked important job?

Thankfully he’s career ends mixing meds killing someone. oh definitely, totally agree there. one touristy cities sure mask mandate great move that. however talking person calling major US city, think one. city also touristy, old NA, biggest city east coast. major Canadian city. sub useful primer vaccines right top. It'll tell need know went doctor doctor decided monoclonal antibody therapy made sense you, absolutely get them. district weekly testing students, teachers, staff, regardless vaccination status. still getting things set vendor though, testing formally begun. gotta prime next generation, know better. They're getting vaccine people fast shipments arrive. Perhaps could gone faster concentrated Pfizer, AZ would hard sell there's endemic Covid, considering risk blood clots.  don’t know yet vaccine works well kids. That’s trials for.

It might kids bad reaction vaccine stronger covid. simply don’t know yet. I've tried communicate parties considering per post can't seem convince guidance symptoms unlikely transmit virus. I've tried communicate parties considering per post can't seem convince guidance symptoms unlikely transmit virus. Lmao subreddit starting remind r/Amd

So what's vaccine best price/perf ratio? yes! three years studied, total ICU occupancy ranged 57.4% 82.1% number beds filled mechanically ventilated patients ranged 20.7% 38.9%. [2013 NIH curious, too, found page, looks legit. long second dose need wait drink **vodka?**

I've read articles advise drinking alcohol, esp. hard spirits, affect immune response vaccine.

Normally like make cocktail evening **50ml vodka**, many days vaccination without risking impacting immune response vaccine?

Thanks. We’ll see trial data says. 

There way know right now. No, students/parents contact schools get positive test. Testing solely students/parents arrange. Administrators check teacher's seating chart class student quarantine students sit desks immediately next student tested positive (unless student vaccinated).

Masks technically ""mandated opt out"" teachers told cannot enforce masks whether students opted not. But, Delta. Previous variants caused disease transmission one person 1-3 people. Delta infects 5 more, looks like could prove like 7-10 people. result, 50% unvaccinated population creating COVID wildfire. read article Atlantic pediatric cases Florida. kids infected younger younger becoming increasingly ill. Doctors pediatric ICUs alarmed - going days 100% capacity full. kids come unvaccinated families. general population LAST week, hospitals Florida running 85% capacity demand rapidly going up.

Don’t allow 50% vaccination rate, indeed high, fool lull comfort, rate breakthrough vaccinated people climbing, too. According Apple News today, likely White House announce need booster vaccination eight months one’s fully vaccinated date, means boosters likely begin late September. even breakthrough case might mild, scientists physicians don’t yet fully understand even mild long-term illness may manifest. mean, wait two weeks vaccination. Wear mask appropriate obey whatever restrictions force. Stay away unvaccinated much possible whether children adults. yeah, that's pretty much idea. even enforced indoors. three days try get handle extent outbreak, came border contact tracers try get ahead virus. can't that, there's lots positive tests, extended. seems Auckland level 4 least 2 weeks, maybe month.

The hopeful sign they've regular sewage monitoring showing positive tests. Chiefs fan, could agree comment more. mean get shot every year might want check angering much It’s fucking joke. There’s guy train conductor yells every day never wears his… even says “It’s every day you.” chastise move in. thought supposed ticket them?! left January know also think way written projects happening future now. quite sure article provided someone AU without understanding would interpret footing Singapore. None Europe kids 12 far know.

We’re still waiting data clinical studies. 

And Pfizer saying needs expand trial/ run longer usually bad news: Means might great/useful vaccine kids. need time bc effect small. SCOTUS rule violates 10th amendment. They’ve one death six months. Even go years, would nearly impossible match insane number deaths.  look anything. Whe family 3 shots SIL fully vaccinated Pfizer. tested positive. Currently symptoms (she's 29). I'm 24 also fully vaccinated, unfortunately, hung SIL couple days ago get tested. Sucks, man. Looks like governor trying hide something. Yup, another clickbait title. titles like inadvertently cause harm good.  PHARMACY- place sorts controls make sure inventory end black market less suicides normal pandemic, more. Go outside stop frequenting sub you’ll find people don’t care anymore. Bars clubs full, people still eating. Travel abroad prolly thing isn’t common point too, haha Unless New Zealand wants turn Australia literally country virus endemic, right move. get act fire spreading weeks, get act second see it. Prior lockdown we've 6 months normal life 0 masks.  may lot easier LDS leadership asking members vaccinate wear masks accumulation among young women could also statistical bias . general, women men Germany received corona vaccination. especially vaccine AstraZeneca, proportion women vaccinated likely significantly higher men. Initially, vaccine recommended people age 60, approval studies sufficiently demonstrate effectiveness older people. mid-April, 86 percent vaccinated AstraZeneca 60 years old. 
According Vaccination Ordinance, however, younger people vaccinated fell prioritization group health professional reasons - example work health care system childcare: occupations high proportion women. could incidence sinus thrombosis women statistical bias.

Interesting caveat. new. Started maybe 3 weeks ago. heck make pharmacy school ? Ok, thank you! not. new. used able track daily site. Jesus christ.

Yes, made point. Croatia needed vaccine economy required it. New Zealands economy grew even closed borders.

Countries who's economies collapsing people infected thousands needed vaccines NZ went six months without single case, growing economy, low unemployment, etc.

It would immoral NZ take vaccine countries like Croatia needed more. Now, we're vaccinating pretty good rate international supply pressures eased. laughing sister two weeks ago moved San Fran past six years never complained people. Though unlike me, went pretty conservative college didn’t lot friends agreed politically. college northeast (where I’ve lived whole life) even though eco-friendly like that, nobody super invasive like sounds like there. Maybe I’m passionate enough Mother Earth, can’t imagine getting strangers business like that. dozen deaths back normal much pandemic. Use brain moment. article planning future, what's happening currently. Make two weeks lockdown. There's point continuing tested already tested positive recovered. may continue test positive months despite active virus (the CDC guideline 3 months testing meaningful again). positive test months ago cdc recommending retesting 90 days odds false positive remnants prior infection higher reinfection. guidance changed? It’s data claims 0.018% chance hospitalization, count 166 million vaccinated Americans tested positive. number countries region vaccination campaign derailed Russia's failure deliver second Sputnik shot. anyone know policy dealing situation? simply re-vaxing everyone? think drug companies would rather make vaccines countries pay...

increasing total number vaccinated globally way really end pandemic department said Tangtang Zhao sold 125 official Centers Disease Control Prevention vaccination cards $10 each.

They need go buyers too. people running around, putting people risk fake document. Yeah get that. Good getting high vaccination rates would safe assume vaccinating kids 12 since tests still ongoing one world started vaccinating kids? High vaccination rates among 12+ pop commendable. I'm saying need full blown lockdowns masking distancing kids vaccinated. point choice live covid. I'm saying we're quite yet liking. Florida report cases daily, weekly, CDC/hospital sources unofficial daily counts recall correctly Outdoor Transmission COVID low, especially you’re fully vaccinated.

I’m masks &amp; vaccine mandates, LA shooting foot here. doubt followed. pandemic isnt yet.  almost zero travel low vaccination won’t able let people whole next year. Isolating country isn’t viable long term strategy. vaccinations are. luck state properly close borders first sign infection. Require 14 day quarantine arrive State. 

That's bulk Australian states done. Except NSW. They're idiots 630 daily cases. Sorry hear : ( failure low vaccination rate. They’ll never able open up. Zero Covid goal good strategy it’s sustainable Covid likely stay. wasn’t media. government Australia limited use AZ people 60 back June. limiting people 50 April.

They “ruined” weapon coronavirus time. Fully agree. Covid stay countries low vaccination rates using lockdowns stuck long time. really needed learn false equivalence. A. Simple bias led flawed reasoning eventually deaths. talking about?? mask wearing ever instituted flu strain population vaccinated?? upvoted  like fines perhaps jail time ;) thought PCR test India cheapest..  economy booming NZ, growing faster US, UK EU. 

Is it? According official data NZ's GDP [shrank almost 3% US countries like Sweden. Although bit better EU I'd hardly call 'booming'. Even Q1 2021 line countries.  Read post…  Probably vast majority deaths unvaccinated people. Oh well. Yes. live Ireland indeed comparing Jewish Holocaust Black apartheid. 
I'll never understand. different rules drunk driving hear making insane comparisons that. 10 lashes spoke quite foreigners/expats Hong Kong office there. definitely views you. got extremely lucky flying HK June, caught 14 day quarantine window almost perfectly. would also love travel HK reasonable border rules. 

On hand, weird going dim sum 87 year old grandma zero covid worries HK. I'm free hug concerns could pass covid. UK, would sure locking indoors still even double vaccinated daily new cases still high. dad diabetic 60+, loves going daily grocery shopping dim sum, able UK least year still lived here. family able socialise together almost freely past year, treat boarding school brother contagion whenever stayed me.

The best way forward HK course get vaccination rates much much higher reopen. vaccination rates dismal distrust government general fear vaccination. think everyone’s patience exhausted, that’s reopened everything let die. Large conservative black populations.  took fairly deep dive COVID-19 interventional clinical trials. 

There's fair number press releases, always preprints. general industry decent job publishing academia small clinics, much. 

And yeah, something least methods section always nice.

Science always repeatable,
With steps clear completable,
The rest trick,
That might look real slick,
But smells like something excretable. 

For far many treatments (e.g., doxycycline) handful trials seem share anything. even press release. 

Which troubling doxycycline seems ineffective put patients risk serious adverse event, esophageal ulcers. 

I mean bad oleander, that's short list stuff kill goat. 

We could certainly use affordable effective treatments COVID-19 could used places still struggling get enough vaccines. 

But somethings simple picking 28 days standard mortality endpoint agreeing death biggest number scale, smallest, would go long way making everything comparable. 

Right there's still lot vital data that's needlessly messy. That's another game would nice change. understand sentiment- however, care whether unvaccinated end sick need hospitalization, presence hospital, overwhelms capacity accommodated, means quality care patients, covid not, impacted. Unfortunately, impact unvaccinated person getting sick isn’t limited individual. it’s still important engage unvaccinated attempt get become vaccinated. smugness, response increasingly illogical attacks people idea what's going on. instance, top world liberty freedom mention economic growth employment statistics border controls, yet people believe live sort tyrannical hellhole economic turmoil. people tell place booming they've never busy.

Sure things perfectly clear yet that's there's still research data modeling going manage Delta (which new variant) government like make promises can't keep. There's also systems place yet - instance vaccine passport system e-gates, self isolate home systems, mention vaccine coverage high enough yet.  CDC proven

They've reliable! /s

LA extra cautious. People whined first city bring back masks proven right that. Same. ""My info"" literally name, birthday, date first shot.   There's many studies mixing vaccines, I've seen particular combination. I've seen reports issues observed combinations, I've also seen reasons there's realistic chance risk combination.  Oldest child still home gets 2nd Monday.

My child home 11, turns 12 Oct 27th. get feeling get first birthday approve then. What's relatively vaccinated standard? (Im US) 3 days restrictions within last six months somehow overkill? think do? Let run wild population low vaccination rates? fully vaccinated, feeling yesterday, took work ( wfh called out), ordered home test, came back positive (the line little faint definitely there)

I primary doctor symptoms mild - cant taste, dry cough, low grade fever (barely enough considered fever) 

They say notify healthcare provider, one notify. I'm wondering still try work need call someone else. New Zealand model fail. going covid shores too. Everybody needs either vaccinated sickened. work. Every human planet gonna get this. obvious yet. known beginning. trying stem tide. gets away us anywhere go full India moment. Waves much much worse without mitigation efforts. widely discussed 4 million died India 6 weeks. Stemming tide mandates curfews perfect prevents full India occuring. presume profile Boise. though restrictions would've tough damaging mental health. got vaccinated Sinovac last June. 2 doses. schedule better vaccine brand. also take that? would kill something?  Well looks like third shot one current mRNA vaccines enough provide excellent protection. repeated every 8-12 months next several years, that's huge problem. takes less 5 minutes get shot, side-effects apparently severe second dose. modified vaccine needed, hopefully take long develop go trials, completely new vaccine time.  probably CDC controlled opposition, actually useful public health body. make decisions keep population pacified enough revolt/outright reject them, letting business owners run highest amount risky profitable activities possible pandemic. lifted masking suggestion, mandate covid vaccines (despite plenty legal precedent), help get pandemic control. need radically rework public health bottom status quo holds best pandemic response get century future pandemics make COVID look like good flu season. Cruel unusual punishment Yep, sure (not sarcastic) years ago (not vaccine related) read back then. people get permanent nerve damage fast majority gets 100% better.

(WA) tell medications taking addition signing form. Even then, person administering shot asked much dose medication on. Maybe could refused share would still received it, definitely pressured explain considering immunocomprimised.

I’d honestly wait you’re immunocomprimised moderate severe side effects second dose. It’s almost 4 months since second dose body clearly remembers covid proteins are. Bleh.  huge portions last 1 half years able live almost pandemic. Life normal.

Except no-one leave visit country. normal? foreigners NZ brutal situation. one remember Italy? India? NYC? Literally one surprised this. safe get vaccinated Sputnik Light (1 dose version Sputnik V) already receiving 2 dosses Moderna? Many businesses Russia accept foreign vaccination, want waist money pcr test every 3 days. already received 2 dosses Moderna May probably going peak different regions different times. Exactly this. Everyone writes things like “I can’t cautious forever!” comes like spoiled brat. worked abroad, told people could come US, caveat stay home see people, would taken offer.   Damn people back home really tie knots deflect even mild criticism St. Jacinda. 

The carry travel bubble Australia absolute proof strategy threatens random sudden border closures small outbreaks totally unsustainable long term. would anyone go NZ whilst threat border rules might arbitrarily change forced spend time quarantine? Look what's happened production LoTR leaving country, level instability utterly unattractive business tourism.

The increasing smugness I'm seeing online people NZ somehow strategy relies places ""controlling things"" blows mind too. sure noticed, nowhere else planet going guys' expectations ""controlling"" virus means - everywhere vaccinating living it. NZ Ardern never going luxury dictating expectations places, going accept part global community point make plans around realistic expectations. Dont call come back...

In case, may matter poor recording and/or local corruption, rather deliberate lies government). maybe not? concerned driver, keep windows open pick time go roads relatively clear.  Strange tbh. Whenever (Europe) locked (even delta) got R 1 cases dropped weeks.

What happening Australia? much less immunity? Lack compliance? Graphic evidence instant lockdown overreaction.   I'm afraid new Zealand going experience Sydney experiencing now. Several EU countries finished vaccination program selling even mRNA vaccines. Try get some. kind disagree, think treatment best line defense. scared flu, vaccine it, knew could get easy counter treatments it.

Vaccination going well. hit 55,000 day yesterday, higher rate per capita US ever reached that's still limited people age 45 plus. open 40 year olds tomorrow, 30 year olds week ages 16 plus 1 September. 

We bought vaccines late waited see vaccine best, went single vaccine strategy, Pfizer. result back line shipments vaccines began arrive end July. finished vaccinating November December. 

For ICU beds 4.6 per 100,000, low compared US Germany, though massively lower number EU countries. 

The economy booming NZ, growing faster US, UK EU. unemployment lower (4%), wage growth higher decade house price explosion created lot wealth. 

In terms working remotely, done outside short lockdowns. vast majority last 18 months things totally normal here. wear masks (aside public transport), social distancing capacity limits. 

But lockdowns very, strict, rating 96 100 Oxford Stringency Index. Hopefully let us return normal quickly. I’ll still feel weak immune systems. people concerned personal freedoms bothered health welfare community. center disease conversations Well unfortunately quite late vaccine party due limited international supply, recourse get rates up.

I impressed [this 

Sure, smaller, bothered post results.

Peer review completely separate process always takes time. 

Posting results fast. data review, done paid professionals volunteer ones. So, posting much faster turnaround.

But far many sponsors press releases publications without bothering post results clinical trials databases first.

And know posting sounds time consuming, not. send email. Like one got trial listed. results filled time. 

It made press yet, proposed sponsors debarred future funding punishment presenting results without posting them. 

Some researchers right thing putting data databases. compete funding ones don't. 

There handful fluvoxamine trials recruiting people add evidence, assuming provide results. Unfortunately, hospitals get overwhelmed easily NZ, even without outbreak. 

We simply can’t afford virus spread, nurses doctors underpaid, hospitals prepared it. Anyone got stats total time NZ lockdwon compared usa   I'm thinking loud, wonder countries low vax, low cases practice strict lockdown measures/masking weather better worst Delta varient.

But yeah, money acceptable barrier comes freedom US. Seems kinda ridiculous put perspective situation like this. ongoing strategy laid last week. It’s detailed, driven experts. 

Also vaccine program opening everyone next week, supply issue. don’t produce vaccine weren’t Dying COVID weren’t priority. also different highly vaccinated almost starting cases. countries world still high baseline levels transmission vaccination levels rising. population vaccinated, much harder even begin spreading.

That obviously stop every case every death, may mean there's never breakout NZ, especially restrictions travelers vaccinated enforced. Maybe racism personally encountered front-of-mind history it.

Not hard add onto signs. thought one case become seven cases delta so... Stay safe ❤️ I’m sure would have. govt unfortunately incompetent terms vaccine rollout I’m getting vaccinated weekend. I’m leaning towards Pfizer another would better? not? depends many people go get shots, safeguards place, (hint: “glorious south,”) kind variants we’re dealing point. one case become 7 cases, Delta variant. Without lockdown, would probably gotten even worse coming days we've already passed that. Great....

Thankfully look like we'll get much higher peak comes. Great hear! Agreed, sure getting downvoted. Like shit, obviously would better rates plummeting, massive 4th wave brewing, could remove mask mandates altogether that's reality. get kids vaccinated, require masks handful hours. 

You want government make flying less annoying, reform TSA. Friend mine got vaccinated April. high school softball game, another parent mocked saying like “now you’re chipped!. belong government!” died last week COVID. imagine would chose vaccine. can’t get enough staff federal government means get staff? Nicely said! Whistling past graveyard. would bet lot money bad north fall. Even many unvaccinated Delta. can’t find anything figured would start discussion they’re effective they’re still used. problem?

People current news, they're looking homework posted thousandth article vaccines proving less effective delta?

[That's Report post ""avoid reposting information"" want, excuse posting out-of-date information. Depends curve is. Cases began declining significantly ago. think deaths plateau soon well. Vaccines prevent disease, bro. 623,000 dead Americans lot? matter many hospitalized dead kids? They’re people. (There Lot kids highschool. 1,900/day 1.5 highschool hospitalized. Every day.)

Some people unconcerned schools reopening forbidding masks schools kids don’t drop like flies time, Sometimes. Meanwhile, millions “not really sick” kids spreading covid every person country like it’s free beer concert. BC, turn 12 year get now. rule like region? I’ve heard say areas it’s 3-6 months 12 well. That’s risk willing take realize Delta variant appeared India significant vaccination rate?

That means appeared unvaccinated population.

You explain that. There's nothing banning making masks available, although I'd question funding would come buy point.  looking like special event bad Misleading title usual.

We always undereport deaths couple days whatever reason they're backlogged get like 150+ 

The Google chart says 7 day average 92 deaths per day (while also 170 deaths 17th headline) go figure. Death certificates take time process, could fluke. old hometown, coroner country also morgue funeral home well. He’s overwhelmed funerals, he’s lagging behind getting death paperwork done. childhood friend mine took assistant position help that.😕 Ice hockey actually!  Day 1 stuffy nose, day 2 complete loss taste/smell. Day 3/4 fever aches, Day 5 fever goes away, taste comes back. Day 6 almost back normal. Day 7 (today) woke airline congestion back. point annoying.

Control education, control people think about. might sound dumb, would schools allowed provide masks child forgot one? would automatically sent home get one? One local Christian highschools announced 12 staff ill undisclosed illness. Students supposed start next week. kinda makes laugh, first schools said enforce Mask. suddenly they're finding loop holes including dress code possibly enforce it.

Every time I’ve seen stat per 100,000 (not per capita). I’m guessing one “wrong” uses everyone keep track of… everything Florida corrupt shit show   Or, likely, family bankrupted parents medical bills. Death isn’t common covid (though far likely “just cold” crowd think), looks like hospitalization, long covid serious damage common anyone thought.  speaking crappy nerve stuff, highly recommend getting Shingrix shot. 

I know BCBS PPO pays 100% it. 

I wish I'd gotten vaccine got shingles first time, ignl. work (remotely) number software companies based Delhi/Noida area peak Delta wave simply could fulfill contracts many staff either sick suffered bereavement. Colleagues friends family India also reporting stories relatively young people died simply get appropriate treatment.

When compared proportion people know India suffered bereavement proportion people UK suffered bereavement seemed way India yet official deaths per capita figures even comparable. UK's way higher.

If apply UK deaths per million (a country healthcare system entirely collapse begun vaccinate January 2020) Indian population would expect around 2.6 million deaths. Less 450k deaths country population 1.3 billion scenes saw April May hospitals entirely overwhelmed played plausible all. lose Afghanistan go 0-4 Rona. Time retire America.

Just talk dad refuses get himself, wife little brother vaccinated take proper caution later things God’s hands.

Rocket Surgery? think mean rocket science.

Yes vaccinated people spread it, less likely get begin with.

If 10 people, vaccinated, 2 become infected spread it.

The next group 10, none vaccinated. 10 catch spread it.

So two groups would rather hang with? Good thinking. Could also r/MaliciousCompliance Glad able get good seat hope fun today spite this. miss baseball games. sounds harsh put lives hold people give fuck take hospital bed spread covid others laziness ignorance? 

The people feel sympathy can't get jab health reasons, I'm continuing mask essential settings (public transport shops).   I'm sure right. Also, folks crowding baseball game probably less likely mask get vaxxed folks leery go big crowded event first place.

I think I'd again, knowing little masking was. encourage reevaluate wishing deaths humans. bet better person immensely frustrated I. need good people, callous people - let militantly ignorant wear down. L - - L PhD, MD.

However, saying anything controversial. read [thread Monica Gandhi. bona fide infectious disease expert one top medical institutions US, even need take word it, links bunch papers. That's bold move, Cotton. Let's see plays out. hospitalizations indicator unvaccinated likely much higher reality. always bad south? company small presence get maybe year. would mutate able propagate unvaccinated person?

The way virus mutates this. left easily replicate, chances genes virus undergo random “copying errors”… “copies” create genetic mutations. 

Vaccines help slow replication, thus less chance errors occur. 

So mutations way likely caused communities low vaccination rates, virus replicating like wild fire. West Seattle today seemed like 80-90% wearing masks. guess 60% game town. know many outlying areas, mask wearing pretty minimal. Right, it’ll keep rising cases exceed population. 

I’m kidding course, even though optimistic predictions weren’t correct, literally *can’t not* peak decline point.  wanted know recommended time frame virus recovery :) many going blame themselves. Disinfection afterward wouldn’t necessary. Surface transmission still isn’t thing. yes, masks. open windows. thought fake actually got Facebook university doubt.   Yes, chance vaccinated unvaccinated people spread covid, although research new (because delta variant fairly new) suggest vaccinated people less likely transmit covid. recent study Well, places use masks pandemic didn’t end vaccine. Flu shots came much later. burned multiple waves killing 70+ million people. sure got psychology degree, I'd love see credible data this. can't seem find any. Many children Asian countries masks various times year. dad got JJ day 9 sick shit. Hes 60s healthy. anecdotal advice assume superhuman fully vaccinated. gone moments thought needed hospital care regularly checking him. First days sounded infinitely worse someone would assume sick phone. Trouble breathing horrible cough. Doesnt fever anymore weak still coughing/feeling struggle breathe comfortably. can’t find anything figured would start discussion they’re effective they’re still used. problem? posted thousandth article vaccines proving less effective delta? Indifference turn anger soon people realize elective procedures delayed kids' school close shift online there's outbreak. affects everybody, let's kid here. talking person question posed guys better? need 3rd doses general public approved immediately. percentage hospitalized vaccinated concerning. fine, college aged? Statistically unlikely permanently harmed virus. vaccinated, basically good go. course, drop feel comfortable. body, protect see fit. expect colleges always best thing you. dad right got JJ I've gotta honest, severely kicking ass. day 9 tomorrow rough shape. I'll talk tomorrow hoping hes made significant improvement today still questioning whether go hospital (admittedly big hypochondriac still)  feel that, simpler level, people arguing *wearing masks*.

*Fucking what*? said 2 countries vastly different many ways good comparison make. dont disagree youre sayiing, doesnt anything said. point lot easier it.  Thalidomide Europe. hospital ships useless New York Los Angeles useless Mississippi. designed trauma care units poor ventilation, cramped quarters, awkward access numerous deficiencies completely inappropriate infectious disease response. designed access disaster areas battle arenas otherwise inaccessible, however Mississippi easily accessible land. New York hospital ship scarcely treated anybody, outbreak.

If anything, send medical personnel augment field hospital staff. bother big old inefficient, lumbering tanker conversions. Mere disaster response theater. hope right. meantime, many children become infected COVID-19? Hundreds thousands people Netherlands whose immune systems work properly benefit, benefit slightly, vaccinations SARS-CoV-2. Part large group produce antibodies immune cells. rest produce little them. vaccinations cause similar problems patients.

In patients vaccinations work better expected. applies, example, dialysis patients patients certain congenital disorders immune system. produce many antibodies healthy people.

People respond well vaccines patients take immunosuppressive drugs, transplant patients, (blood) cancer patients people congenital disorders immune system. People HIV people syndrome also risk.

Immune-suppressing drugs taken, example, patients autoimmune diseases rheumatoid arthritis. extent effect vaccinations diminished immunosuppressive drugs depends dosage, use combinations drugs severity condition. total, 820,000 Dutch people took immune check 2020, according Foundation Pharmaceutical Statistics. first six months 2021, 520,000 people so.
Since beginning year, eight studies running Netherlands different subgroups patients suffer impaired immunity. ZonMw, main financier medical-scientific research, allocated 15.5 million studies.

In webinar organized ZonMw today, first results four studies announced. yet published peer reviewed.

Collaboration

The studies conducted close collaboration Dutch UMCs. RIVM ZonMw ensured studies use standardized method measure immune response participants, results mutually comparable.

Severe kidney disease patients three five times higher risk dying covid-19 average. study vaccination kidney patients yielded relatively favorable outcomes patients renal failure dialysis patients. 80 percent patients produced sufficient antibodies complete vaccination.

Of undergone kidney transplantation, two-thirds respond responded inadequately vaccination. build protection, enough.

Survivors

In patients undergone lung transplantation, picture complicated. contract covid-19, transplanted lungs affected.

Patients undergone lung transplantation survived covid-19 build good defence virus vaccination. One vaccine sufficient booster natural defenses. Patients waiting list lung transplant also benefit vaccination.

The situation different transplanted patients yet received covid-19. 100 patients took part study, 13 percent produced sufficient antibodies.

Blood cancer

Every year ten thousand diagnoses form blood cancer lymphoma Netherlands. patients various disorders immune system. study, 850 patients selected 17 different forms blood lymph node cancer risk severe course covid-19.

In patients, functioning immune system disturbed. may undergoing chemotherapy, immunotherapy cell therapy tumor paralyzing immune system. also patients receiving immunosuppressive drugs whose immune system recovering stem cell transplant.

According guidelines, patients group receive vaccination treatment hematological condition. study, patients get vaccinated. reacted better expected produced sufficient antibodies, others not.

Variation

A similar difference reactions vaccination occurs patients congenital disorders immune system. produce antibodies all, others sufficient degree.

The patients severe forms immunodeficiency - lack certain substances crucial immune system - benefit vaccination.

A third possibly even fourth shot could improve protection people immune problems. research done this. another group patients, even third even fourth shots elicit protection, researchers expect.

You also look number 'excess deaths' 2020 quantify impact covid19 deaths. CDC found estimated 545k 660k persons died US causes 1/26/20 2/27/21 expected typical year. Covid19 death count people would've died soon anyways.

Didn’t realize whole story thanks educating me. Polio mild symptoms, symptoms all, 99.5% infected people. 0.5% serious symptoms, death rate 2% children around 20% adults. keep mind, talking 2-20% 0.5% Polio infections. far COVID all. ""So Preoccupied Whether Could, Didn’t Stop Think Should""
-Thomas Jefferson, Probably  Florida health department changed counting method. Deaths number going since then. draw NZ plan beyond ‘Elimination Strategy’ end date. 

Australia least set roll plan based vaccination rates, year government indicated lockdowns extreme circumstances highly concentrated areas. Vaccinated Australians free come go country, travel bubbles considered certain countries. 

Adern’s attitude seems line WA Premier Mark McGowan said tolerate Covid state, regardless vaccination rates. 

My prediction NZ continue going lockdowns whenever cases time come Lol downvoted truth. commissioner says he’s worried masks children’s development. Maybe concerned Covid could children’s health short term long term. lunacy. I'm reading right, anyone got 2 doses AZ get 2 doses either Pfizer Moderna, 4 shots total. guess means safe get many jabs? Shut wear mask also want kill teachers. ^67 ^67 “Cases” bars fall little short (😅) conveying difference glance… It’s billionaire class running shit. worries NZ low vaccination numbers lot natural immunity population. going hell track trace people cluster really visiting lot places within country.

On penultimate day, lily pad covers half lake. day that, quarter. 5 days earlier, you’d barely notice. great vaccination rate except fact bad last winter things getting worse. I'm trying say vaccines work, obviously do, I'm worried delta much worse. know greater percentage cases last weeks ages 9-19, know exact ages. likely going appeal students dissent vaccine based misinformation, likely rejected school. mRNA vaccines derived aborted fetal tissue.

Here’s article January, instance. - also see links article ones months addressed whole use aborted fetal tissue cell lines ok too. Alright thanks, sounds like plausible explanation, hope right. said anything tents parking lots? Perhaps someone help wrap head around this.

There talks might surge Northeast fall Delta. Right now, state (NH) seen daily increases cases since July, like everywhere else country.

So, seeing notable rise cases August, like, double fucked fall winter? seem like break rising cases based seasonality. I'm ignorant Brazil. Obrigado! hasn’t really started yet. it’s still low double digits stamp out. mask + distance + STFH

Because original NYT article behind paywall. merits changed last year. 

And tents parking lots ""ventilated outdoors"" uncomfortable. places go ""proof vaccination negative test within last 72 hours"", prompt many get vaccine eventually.

People going find getting tested within 3 days every public outing unsustainable much hassle.

Having test option also helps currently eligible vaccine. EXACTLY. Every time try point people IRL look like I'm crazy person. clear month ago going happen Delta, everyone ignored started showing front door. think part problem 99% people actually looking numbers like us internet obsessives, even know numbers growing people actually know start getting sick. work healthcare, it’s getting really hard. people actively try achieve herd immunity punching teachers killing cashiers asking wear mask per law, flood hospitals, pooled private insurance Medicare (taxpayers) foot bill, it’s hard feel bad them.

It’s important point people sometimes acting like doesn’t matter mostly unvaccinated dying it’s fault. 

There collateral damage, much visible vaccinated countries like UK (but US probably vaccinated elderly deaths increased spread, lower percentage unvaccinated stupid old people). Look UK governments covid statistics page. prove you? 

Look demographics deaths

Then look proportion demographics deaths vaccinated

It's publicly available

If need source is: UK government website I'm seeing people talk mixing vaccines lately something i've ever researched. research it? know makeup vaccines similar longest time, told stick one got first second dose told mix match.

LOL think scientific determinations effect states' policy HAHAHA. policy left let Delta run population see chips fall. can't count state policy, hospital bed, help natural disaster, individual what's necessary protect themselves, scientists tell difference checked box ""booster"" checked box ""1 2 dose"" Hey, we’re ranked 48th education reason. repeated different way! want? real?

When said ""60% gravely ill patients Israel fully vaccinated"" without context, reasonable person would likely take mean vaccines providing little-to-no protection severe disease

But additional context provided, becomes clear that, respect severe disease, vaccines working advertised.

I'm afraid raw data, I'm afraid raw data decontextualized give people biased understanding reality situation is. 12 counts ""theft government property,"" digital records. They're physical cards possession. Exponential growth hard politically need act problem.

Edit:added detail data support giving additional doses vaccine highly immunocompromised persons nursing home residents, general public,” said Dr. Celine Gounder, infectious disease specialist Bellevue Hospital Center former adviser pandemic would warranted vaccines failing prevent people ending hospitalized Covid-19, said.

Well, agree might really early 3rd jabs Hm, Covod 19 Task Force conference today referring too? admittedly watch entire conference, really see anything justifying 8 month wait specifically? Obviously saying boosters recommended point potential waning immunity, I'm seeing real explanation risk folks given sooner, especially since that's already happening countries understand it. wish Dad could get booster next month instead waiting wading 3 months Delta, I'm seeing good reason can't. guess really choice wait, giving major anxiety, gonna lie. :( info devastating younger children 

Your child better chance dying car accident COVID.

The media likes publish sad stories child dying COVID, death impossible, *extremely* unlikely. seriousness illness long term complications. data released Wednesday Centers Disease Control Prevention warns ""significant decline"" vaccine effectiveness infection COVID-19 nursing home residents, highly contagious Delta variant virus causes spike hospitalizations among mostly unvaccinated Americans.  understand this? Indiana majority cases year January February basically one fully vaccinated. data months doesn’t tell anything effectiveness vaccines adding graph like good way skew data make impossible draw legitimate conclusions it. 

I’m fine articles like people still making minds vaccines aren’t sharpest could work sway them, thread like everyone vaccinated admit graph useless.  Never got first lol  MetroCon (the vaccine proof part), god fun part big convention without worry. It’s also choice profession. chose mine knowing full well remote work strong possibility. one forced take job done person. Funny that, virus suddenly became IQ test. feeling safe? Also, feeling safe vaccine, bother getting another one?  Springs way conservative Denver Boulder always extra vaccines available back March. I'll definitely go back get booster sooner. Headlines like misleading though case numbers high large majority cases cold symptoms don’t require hospitalization it’s nearly bad last year. 

Also it’s 3 weeks since put mask mandates back I’d hope rising case numbers. death numbers already. article listed 382 deaths, almost certainly unvaccinated people. It’s still mostly safe us. 

I swear people wish bad news. Anything English could possibly summarize it? 7 many? GBS, something else neuro? get mandatory sick days vaccine side effects? 8 months puts state January. I'm hoping strict numbers, getting booster shots holiday gatherings would ideal.  5 Israelis great results. Alabama isn’t going start publishing K-12 numbers dashboard mid-September earliest. give plenty time hide insanity likely happening right now. interesting. wife immune compromised unvaccinated 4 yr old.

This woman delusional thinks there's kind shortage ""problem"" getting people vaccinated United States people *really* stupid. reality, argument ""Why give *additional* protection responsible people there's irresponsible people refuse get vaccinated could vaccinate!?"". zero awareness actual fucking problem. Rather compare breakthrough hospitalizations total number vaccinated, would make sense compare total number covid hospitalizations.

GTFO 86% effective = 7x immunity boost.

Multipliers better way communicating vaccine efficacy percentages. Percentages imply people get protection others don't. Multipliers correctly communicate people immunity boosting effect vaccines everyone, average, also fact vaccine provides absolute protection, increased protection. Percentages may lead vaccine hesitancy based incorrect understanding: ""Only 65% effective? I'll take chances virus!"" Multipliers correctly turn decision no-brainer: ""Triple natural protection virus? want that?""

Then got guy tortures dogs

Doesn't seem like entirely honest argument. bit baffling clear-cut way mitigate infections amongst “experts.” 

The data still shows vaccines effective, masking still important. waning immunity, Delta tidal wave, lack masks that’s causing nationwide uptick? That’s question experts don’t know answer to. 

That said, getting fucking booster not? anything? feel though nobody knows do. Hate tell you, DNA adenovirus vectored vaccines (J&amp;J, AZ, Sputnik) make mRNA order make spike protein. mRNA vaccines skip bunch steps provide mRNA ready go.

When cells regular cell stuff, use mRNA it. Like say cell divides, gets ready making bunch mRNA make bunch cell parts. normal part day cells. minimum, requiring staff anyone entering building, including parents, provide proof vaccination strict mask policy. Supposedly vaccinated severe cases reported hospitals among immunocompromised people vaccine stimulate B cell memory (these cells remember past immunizations illnesses). encounter measles, body would remember. would take time mount response via producing antibodies. normal. 

It’s looking like level covid antibodies wane time current shots. also normal. 

If get infected, body remember start fight it. don’t high enough level antibodies get-go, Delta replicate quickly become ill body gets control. 

So body likely lifetime immunity, takes little kick start system time develop symptoms. 

It help Delta makes large viral load, need little make sick.

TLDR; body remember. it’s since shot, may need ramp response. time, Delta may make sick. No, hospitals UK 'overwhelmed'. motive pretending covid worse is? post removed cannot verify reliable source. Twitter sources may reliable. possible, please re-submit link reliable source (i.e. news article).

There's fair share evidence piling Nature showing durable, robust immunity infection appears long lasting, effective variants (or much vaccine is). extra vaccines much needed unvaccinated countries though. vaccinated part US still well protected getting severe covid surge cases US largely unvaccinated population.

I'll try patient! I'm medical expert shocked one shot Pfizer Moderna recommended them. Isn’t get flu shot every year?

Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Here's one: Delta ran course, got immunity hard way ,our national sero servey says 2 3 Indians antibodies covid. reason know never cared know logical explanation first place long would school board able Andrew Jackson style ""the governor made decision, let enforce it"" moment? It'd require lot support chain command wonder school boards would able pull reference, recent German-Israeli study suggested June 20th 2021, Ecuador excess mortality 62,000; compared official Covid death toll 21,000. Exponential growth doesn’t really work way. way stop covid totally eliminate it. 

For example, original virus r0 lowish single digits (2-5). delta variant reported double that. vaccines approximately 50% effective preventing transmission 100% vaccination puts us back square one. 

The virus showing us evolve ways evade vaccines/immune system. 

Delta started endemic India. spread js tearing US south. Regions likely continue see periods waves.

Get vaccinated take advantage protection can. seen majority family ever since started. Normally would travel back at-least two times per year.. 

Now finally got vaccinated host country looking forward going back fall. Delta, kids cannot get vaccinated yet… complications international travel, rising cases strained medical systems destination..

The edge two sided sword destination country probably vaccines kids host country. qualify both…

International travel become FOOBAR.  Like Twizzler, born walk alone 🎵 that's actually really cool.   Vaccines never cured disease.

The vaccines FDA approved end year. become annual thing (which still don’t know; know timing third shot could boost protection years), would exactly like flu shot.

I idea went political tangent. clear see Brazil lesser

Yes, Brazil behind pretty much 27 EU members states based measures. mean Brazilians less valuable Europeans, means Brazil less developed us, pretty obvious anyone knows anything world. case vaccines mandatory places? can’t get places unless newest booster moving forward? C’mon Israel great waning immunity vaccine Delta. forsee similiar trend delay US. I'm LA go movies least week. I'm vaccinated wear mask whole time, I've fine. Hopefully working nee formula. Taking booster every 6 months 8 months seems hard implement large scale.  Notice people say ""I live fear"" *them.* Like, cool bro, ""live fear"" either, I'm trying protect community. good… Black Plague killed 1/3 Europe. public, (kind of) understand, professor ""public health expert""? impossible.

Mainland China 6 new local cases.

As long New Zealand also takes seriously everyone complies containment measures, also defeat it. Agreed. I'll bet vast majority done pharmacies. state literally fire calling banishment fire resistant houses…

Non-zero chance someone actively infected. Great point thx Much appreciated  Thank ya kindly ! agree general consensus sub seems everyone wants booster (based comments), makes wonder affects current vaccine passports appearing around country ? It’s currently one jab mutate something next year boosters required still status maintained vaxxed. 

TLDR: mandating boosters recommending them, people get boosters suddenly “non vaccinated” camp. 

Probably early kinds questions makes wonder… worry bit.  Still issue - 400 hospitalized. people US probably still think vaccines alone enough get us pandemic. Im teacher. think happened would uncontrollable sneezing coughing fit person's face. know country music singers millionaires boots, base probably pissed. employer going provide computer software, etc job, I'm fine putting software monitor work screen whatever. want use equipment? Fuck installing monitoring software home pc. 

My current employer provides laptop, etc. isolate laptop network, use work VPN, etc. really give shit employer wants see work screen.   Even though great distrust medical industry got J&amp;J months ago. Mandate vaccines travelers.

We're quickly approaching point drop travelers greater amount unvaccinated people would want travel. aware 3rd dose? want especially Israelis recommending 5 months, can't see getting vaccine card noted. think technically pharmacies unless immunocompromised. Isn’t lot vaccines work 3-dose regimens? number always higher low test rate southern states.  herd immunity would also mean get 35k cases day. explained numbers dropped rather 'out blue' make sound  areas low vaccination rates, get hit hard previously probably see death rates approaching, maybe even eclipsing saw 2nd wave. think we'll see whole. There's enough susceptible population left. move got vaccinated April/May I’ve misplaced card; state digital vaccination records. think problem go booster without paper card can’t find it? Possible evidence brigading? cases appear reaching peak. rate cases increasing slowed significantly. probably see start drop soon. Well asking r/covid19 weekly thread good idea learn something works. tools compare contrast. one side, continuously, 1.5 years now. 20 year old male who's received 2 doses Moderna, I'm hesitant receive 3rd one. think we're likely see increase chance myocarditis 3rd dose compared 2nd? that's case, may worth get 3rd dose given possible risk considering 2 doses work well enough me. easiest, lowest cost, lowest risk step take slow transmission.

The infuriating part objectively, cost low, whether money inconvenience, grown adults kicking, screaming, punching way opposition big bad government told something. 

And what's worse clearly bungled basics public (due politicization) lowest common denominators want lift finger they're told helps others. There's century court precedent says discriminatory. What's really selfish stupid fact bed needed one people one fewer bed someone suffering non-virus related problem. God forbid heart attack Houston need new kidney Orlando. Well, deaths. need insult intelligence

Nah, insult lack intelligence. upvoted. 0 scientific evidence ""expect boosters every 6 months so"" bullcrap. kind language doubt (or already is) used antivaxxers. 2 options. Vaccine mandates everywhere deny access people, including jobs. Bill hospital visits. think logical course. walk emergency room loved one full equally sick people say ""I've waiting day"" see south Carolina 80% capacity wave hit yet, what's 10 hours road save someone's life?   There’s way CES happens person. It’s normally 150k people. word efficacy soon? Could immune system destroy quickly enough additional training? Similar Israel's data prior infection's protection vaccinated baseline. also wonder third dose given 5 months later given time immunity mature (b-cell affinity). way get rid Break chain transmission. say think it’s okay refuse vaccination?

I’m saying shouldn’t celebrate unvaccinated infections/deaths - want virus stopped, that’s counterproductive. actually **all over** atm.

From politics: Real stuff, raaaw stuff. know many limited circle. Customer service reps, call-center employees, administrative assistants, paralegals...my wife's former job property service firm office workers getting minimum wage (aside managers). low-paying jobs done remotely long computer, internet, phone, people know WFH schedules since March 2020.

May right around time cases started declining US Delta begun spread yet. CDC changed mask guidance well. goal supposed reaching herd immunity, supposedly could reached 70% May? Less 50% case decline made appear amount enough deal regular strains, seemed case time. So, obviously, best time vaccinated people remove masks nation highly vaccinated! /s

The problem really less outright lying obfuscation information. CDC still never come outright said, ""We need vaccination rates 85%-90% nationwide order move pass this"" set real vaccination goals matter. know Delta could possibly settle here? course chose instead waste precious time posturing masking. Same. think we've got hold ~dec/jan, last read. 👏 👏 👏 bodies??? touching camera fence fucking f\*\*\*\*\* LA, AR, OK? also completely nuts. NM fully onboard Disease Sweepstakes. it’s safe FDA standards yet

That incorrect statement. longer studies run determine long term efficacy, safety. EUA indicator we're confident enough safety data authorize use remaining data gathered. send kids respirators then? Screw unmasked ones. never served misinformation whatsoever. incredibly disrespectful suggest have. 

I simply pointed admission rules allowing negative tests *good* thing, something apparently completely unwilling accept. end here. Florida right behind em Yeah Friday night went packed warehouse rave downtown LA might done trick LOL...They checking digital vaccine records door least everyone vaccinated. Still careless though I’m going vigilant cases go again. He's greatest entertainer time. Yes better Michael Jackson. amazing fans, great songs nice guy. get told clear masks? Wonder they'd say that? supposed working, got call, answer, adequately explain absence really heard, think person performance problems anyway M-o-o-n, spells Nebraska Fighting pandemic society reducing r-factor value less 1. goal masks vaccines help, combined work better one them.

In June looked like vaccination rate 50% alone enough end pandemic, delta broke theories even 80% seem enough. bad sources reporting Mexico's news English awful, otherwise AMLO would preferred target region Reddit instead Bolsonaro

Just last week complained kids need back school get away ""the Nintendo"" also complained violence videogames

Also, talking school openings said ""doesn't care majority thinks"" experience anti vax family don’t seem care may risk others I’ve heard tell stories bald faced lied friends vaccinated friends hang them. They’re side Canada can’t much sway matter. Yeah that’s good place be. family northern Virginia, feel fairly safe there. cancel trip Florida visit us. don’t blame one bit. Dude need see studies children show loss grey matter density, blood clot bio markers, IQ drops.

Wish 3 those... damn... wonder would like... I'm sorry loss. 10/20 dad died hospice, home.(not covid) nurse absolute respect hospice workers, them. Made time much easier able give dad pain free peaceful death deserved dignity. really sucks. Covid really highlighted lot issues public schools, ie: class sizes 30+

Minimal learning occurring 30+ kids classroom. crowd control point productive learning environment. Garth packs em out. Granted saw Tulsa (5ish years ago?). shows like three nights row, sold ended double headers. Back back concerts sold too. Garth man. think brainwashed ? 75% hospitals Florida expect hit critical staffing capacity issues within week. Hospitals dense areas already sending patients care centers ICUs hitting capacity. state’s case count 20k per day hospitalizations lag 7 days cases. 75% can’t possibly account hospitals offloading patients. cases stay 20k week even continue rise, see tents start going military coming help.  That's makes laugh. Dude went probably worst area spreading Covid. concert 74,000 unmasked people, like ""Hmm might bad idea.""

Oh think? both.

WHO another bad take. Parents homeschooling kids managed organize socialization activities decades. think would safer create small social group people agree testing, masking, staying small bubble cramming kids back one building. disagreeing. saying 2 way street. People saying, ""oh, proved office this"" acting like employees leverage world.

Good thing vaccinated. well, matter time.

And people really wonder public drink kool-aid presented...changed,...then presented again? fully vaxxed think it’s reasonable position have, please try convince anti vax family friends though Yea totally agree this. I’m, like many us, probably opposite anti vax one could possibly be, there’s way hell, healthy person, would get third dose heart fucked two weeks haha. suspect eight months would make rollout smoother (many people vaxxedin March Jan). Nothing that. Vaccines work number breakthrough cases concerning. Apparently told people received third dose vaccine, likely fairly age, 63, places higher risk category suffering severe case contracts virus. H**owever, he’s told people received third booster dose vaccine, two sources told NBC  universally praised medical science rapidly developed effective safe treatment potentially life threatening condition. hope governor recovers praises medical community reiterates dangerous COVID everything protect it, like getting novel treatment.  point though, cdc terrible giving us goals end game. Thanks linking additional article, I'm 99.9% certain apply competitors sporting events. thought, wow, school-aged children lasting 14 days covid 950%. must dropping like flies. damn thing. *kicks stone*  Ive heard, booster make feel second shot.

Women definitely get vaccinated.  Essential business carrying on, we're thing March 2020. true, imagine people one's immediate vicinity potentially subject droplet contact.

Again, comparable indoor venues concern air-circulation recycle -- likely near vicinity droplet spread.

But yeah, tough sell get people wear masks hot summer outdoor events.

Oh normal masked probably, otherwise looking society probably imo, arent enough people take vaccine taking first place make cant get vaccinated, thats ended delta. still eat public (just carry drive thru). 100% opinion tho. NSW - staying lockdown vaccinated months end - far worse mental health economy  ""it's flu"" ""I immune system"" ""I might placed ventilator"" ""I wish vaccinated"" Dang that’s awesome! I’m az same. Modifying vaccines would relatively easy, *technically*, running new trials currently fast-shifting environment challenge. push modified vaccine onto public without least trials. like they're choosing stupid possible.     I'm puzzled US saying 5% ICU admissions fully vaccinated whereas Israel says half. terrain really different?

The percentage vaccinated people Israel supposedly higher, already sufficient explain numbers.

Imagine hypothetical country 100% population vaccinated. 100% COVID cases ICU would breakthrough caes vaccinated patients - definition. 5 years would love look long term reprecucussions different strategies; prioritizing economy people vise versa. would imagine NZ healthcare population much better shape maybe short term economic decline, bet long term fare far better.

There serious problem definition ""exposure"" followed.

The contact tracers counting exposure stand less 3 6 feet infected person 15 minutes. Using definition exposure found spread schools happen clusters schools. completely false since classrooms crowded indoor spaces primary means virus spreading.

The health officials contact tracer's methods based faulty long obsolete model spread solely droplet. However, pathogen known extensively spread airborne aerosols containing live virus remain infectious float air system hours days, little difficulty passing around flimsy cotton masks. would absolutely reduce spread significantly mask mandates. one case already become five since news broke. people trying murder children.

I fucking idea absolutely trying murder children. US Israel used three-week time Pfizer shots. UK Canada places used 8-12 weeks. guess turn big part reason data disparate. Im curious see cases trend. Right seeing relatively low cases we've already hit 74.4% full vaccinated 12+ population. Winnipeg even higher numbers vast majority people still wearing masks. Delta definitely dominant variant see things shake next month.  Cole Well NSW premier racing first open up. goes badly, say 50 dead day, states may decide modelling fucked, 80% vaccination needed. Sweet. Going try judge higher man, judged Cases underreported due to

2. pacify public project picture good governance. common. States ""low"" counts citizens happy ""conquered"" virus. Ignorance bliss. public unaware know relative admitted ICU. directly children, parents family members. losing parent child's development?

I thought GoP party family! Signs actually longer interval improves efficacy/longevity least degree. 'Stuff all' = much.

There kiwis thread claiming reason slow rollout sort virtuous strategy allow needy vaccines first. That's patently true. was, would waiting entire developing world opportunity get vaccinated this.

The delay due government procurement, dithering putting necessary infrastructure place, nothing else. got fully vaccinated UK (early 30s) long dad even heard first dose NZ (60s). people false sense security, that's government IMO. dumb hell, require vaccinated people events ditch masks.

LA County taking security theater shit far. Covid-19 vaccinations ends pandemic, endless masking. * creating perfect storm vaccine resistant variants.  permanently suspended, review September. What's happened Australia they've (admittedly smaller) outbreaks keep travel open safe areas close travel hot spots.

I agree, completely crazy. thing COVID infectious country could go ""fine"" ""desperate need"" matter weeks first infections. Source: Spanish problem huge waves always breakdown testing infrastructure.

With high positivity rates it‘s impossible say peak testing simply can‘t keep up. seems plateau suddenly start fall. plateu cases rise fall don‘t get identified. crazy.

Pfizer AZ similar risk profiles various things.

And might turn AZ ""better"" long term vaccine technology promotes t-cell generation whereas mRNA aims maximum antibody response.

I Pfizer myself.  wonder worried roughly 20,000 Canadians died influenza every year pre-covid

Lots people, plenty people! general public discourse meany people care. 

I hope COVID taught us put public health forefront nations concerns moving forward public health crux this. Improving public health covers wide range diseases conditions. approach best divisive worst destructive. Lets build learn COVID. Lets make masks regular part every day life people get sick, lets improve long-term care facilities, lets improve quality life public health sector employees cleaning staff head doctors, lets improve sick leave change work place culture around sick days...

There hundred thousand little big things could do. federal provincial scale, - things - individual scale. Things like  caring others, building communities, putting others needs wants (e.g. wearing masks, socially distancing). 

You complain media. reflecting upon yourself, behaviours might better prepared serve public good pubic health going forward. Lol... that's funny couple different levels. Cancer contagious.

There's flu vaccine every year. also less contagious less deadly covid. flu season practically non existent last year. Even people staying home masking, deaths covid. Imagine done things.

Simple math also shows 5% covid cases worldwide result death. that's actually included stats. know places like Russia China bullshitting numbers. People dying areas hospitals overwhelmed can't keep often reported stats. estimated. think world death total 10x official count 40 million. funny thing actually matter whether technically responsible. happened watch need accountable that.  fair, considering amount infections already happened USA, really doubt take random sample 100 without picking someone alredy COVID.

For example, Singapore going transition endemic covid, even reporting daily cases, way could it, flight transiting via Singapore ruled low risk. 

To clear I'm totally fine that, fact think plan govt laid much relaxed. zero covid never happen country forever.

Like something virulent Spanish Flu rolls around again, going screaming masks vaccines work die droves? Southern states banned localities, schools, businesses enacting mask vaccine mandates absolutely screwed. They've basically ham strung ability react pandemic there's way they're gonna get everyone board ""personal responsibility"" pandemic spreads beyond point controlled. really frustrating US basically resigned never able stop pandemic despite paper ""best prepared"" country world handle one. Keep cost send abill help.  Hoping America follows suit. know who's downvoting you, really want get demotivated, try understand. 

Yes, FL TX started low point. But, currently high change percentage high 14 day new cases. means percentage big, raw numbers big too! normalize population, see 14 day cases even higher still (compared states).

When see CA jumping 19% change percentage, raw numbers low (164,441 cases). means started ~ 137.7K cases

When see FL jumping 15.9% change percentage, raw numbers high (286,515 cases). means started ~ 247.2k cases. FL alarming, there's tons articles FL. 'bad' CA jumped up, reached number cases FL FL jumped similar, yet smaller amount.   Interesting question… maybe made privy exposure? strange risking livelihood this. thought pharmacists made decent money. drastically changed recently, effective one dose. trialed one dose.

They also running 2 dose trial parallel. means nothing mortality fact used vaccines.

That's complete horseshit. dangerous variants vaccine resistant arising parts world notably South Africa Brazil. Mutations random mean anything. matter mutated strain outcompetes rest. depends selective pressure. Vaccines put significant selective pressure. danger developing vaccine resistant strain especially higher countries halfway 60% vaccinated selective pressure high enough virus still significant unvaccinated pool infect. That's experts recommend restrictions put place country mark. even possible plan conduct school kinds quarantine numbers? There's guy ?Texas? shot six times neck shoulder *still* able get scheduled surgery they're overwhelmed covid patients. ten days now. also entirely possible got someone asymptomatic even know it, asymptomatic even know it. fact that's likely form transmission given permutations. 
 
And, may wrong this, vaccinated antibody test always comes back positive, there's way ever ""check history"". Guess never know. oh shit, dangerously close strategy 600,000 people dead didn’t seem work Yes no. register separate vaccine card? I’m exact position considering taking approach, little worried two parallel cards.  *The Daniels eventually came around idea scheduled get vaccine mid-July -- week died, nephew said. Daniels' symptoms hit end June quickly ""spiraled control"" around July 4.* *actual* ""Red Tide"".   sadly 90 day mortality rates &lt;65 patients ventilators ARDS could improved nearly 80% Doctors combined Mesoblast's Remestemcel-L Dexamethasone vs Dexa' alone (standard care) NIH cocked trial last year.

Beyond slight Dexamethasone improvements still treatments critical C-19 patients slack NIH/FDA. need new trials? trial years flu vaccine right? look russian flu 1889. recently people starting think actually coronavirus.

""After 2002–2004 SARS outbreak, virologists started sequencing comparing human animal coronaviruses...

...the human coronavirus OC43 split bovine coronavirus 130 years before, approximately coinciding pandemic 1889–1890...

....A study contemporary medical reports shows clinical manifestations similar COVID-19, another disease, caused coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, symptoms influenza. notable similarities multisystem disease, loss taste smell perception, protracted recovery like long COVID.""

They outbreaks 5~ years. death rate 3% too. (Theoretically) one viruses responsible common cold  I'm sure immunity boosted body fights off. Also I'll antibodies specifically tailored fighting Delta. Thank you.

Here's United's policy ask twice unmasked passengers put masks document incident without taking action.

That would fine, banned future flights. mean, avoid confrontation air, ban airlines. I'm look Florida chart we're due least two months death bed regrets. Fucking hell. Facebook YouTube etc keep track cards. mom forgot card second shot looked info gave another card. 2 cards wait Here’s key study, like reports studies this:

“We defined bed use (occupancy) percentage beds use total number “operational beds” reported ICU. Operational beds defined Project IMPACT “the total number licensed ICU beds unit maintain nursing staff considered operational.”

This lot people, including reporters, gloss over. It’s expensive hospital staff bed nobody it, included available bed must that. So, hospitals shut areas hospital lower occupancy purposely reduce staffing requirements save money. Nothing wrong it’s see lot hospitals hitting 80% occupancy regularly. It’s design. Now, fine you’re comparing normal situations, you’re comparing time hospitals dealing surge capacity stretch limits resources, throw beds tents, hire traveling nurses, send elective surgery patients home, etc, etc. well sort % capacity different shouldn’t compared “normal” times. Good way get shot here. Pandemic: medical denial service attack common core Earth numbers. Every good Alabamian knows Earth 6000 years old. /s People moving visiting family? 

&amp;#x200B;

Pretty clear old way tourism business travel pretty unsustainable climate change tourism airline industry change eventually. got it, wonder ""resets clock"" Hospitals pay instead. put them. give health insurance companies way avoid paying. know sucks way aborted fetuses? Dead actual kids people pissed around waiting vegan vaccines. 

I’m atheist philosophically speaking religion argument doesn’t stack believe God created everything shouldn’t big leap believe God also gave science stem cells work with. 

FFS it’s like there’s fetus farm financial incentives abortions. Honestly get vaccine choose to, impact hospitals…. Yeah, empathy starts wane bit. Wow. I'm learning lot ERs across country. Thank response, paramedic. IMO guys get enough credit pay do. I've paying attention recently 14yo daughter thinking getting certified old enough (our school district offers EMT training high school students), I'm amazed appalled many medical field treated poorly. eBay? selling eBay? Exactly, doses goes countries need desperately, NZ one those. cost vaccinations nothing compared cost maintaining border quarantine facilities. Conservatives threatening shoot door door vaccination people. Seems like county would poised make good threat. used work Dalton still former coworkers there(all medical). sad. working article came ranked Dalton one least educated towns US…. low vaccine rate doesn’t surprise me. means every 8 unvaccinated people hospital, would 1 vaccinated person, else equal. 

That's ""ultra rare"" like said, unless also ultra rare unvaccinated people. We've bought several times many vaccinations population too, including millions doses AZ vaccine plan give away Pacific use domestically. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's nothing richer countries everything supplying there's need. also question legality using Federal funds American Rescue Plan

It's legal. get challenged court shot down, like 90% dumbass laws, mandate bans, etc states tried pass.  Thank you! Fortunately chronic thing shoukd. frustrating Dr two completely different pages. appreciate concern something serious, but... looks like duck sounds like duck... probably duck. great step, always seems like policies/rules two steps behind delta, doesn’t care you’re vaccinated. Mild breakthrough cases still lead spread among others. Next time everyone else does. know likely another 50-to-100-year pandemic lifetime. please...    sorry… can’t even imagine…my four year old son supposed meet preschool teacher tonight begin private preschool Thursday ( first time ever) , bad cold last several days. home Covid test yesterday, negative. cough grew progressively worse. went urgent care today could fit seen pediatrician openings. tested today officially Covid urgent care clinic . 

Even though officially result yet, reached would “first ever teacher” yesterday via text sick felt better risk it….this doctor visit today official testing today. 

And literally hard struggle let go amazing beautiful milestone week son, let go selfish desires , put teacher first, kids….as hard was… cry lot tears mourning Target today (while masked) buying cold humidifiers items help breathe comfortably… know going attending right thing. won’t attending school week. (And maybe semester look things)….

Now, I’m waiting Covid results.

All say, cannot imagine full class, families living lives 1-3-4 plus kids household…. hopes dreams trying provide kids…. “normalcy.”…. 

To slapped face unknown secrecy like experiencing…. truly unnerving sorry. slept infected person. couple years plan moment, depending risk profile. Vaccinated people safe countries need quarantine, vaccinated people medium risk countries self isolate 1 week home, everyone else still go managed quarantine facilities. Kinda regret avoiding Moderna. Tweety Bird’s Granny sure bang job, tell ya. I’m sure person qualified comment. stays it’ll normal thing kids get part life that’s harmless… that’s huge assumption, seems current variants fatality risks answered question. 

It almost sounds like want answered something. Okay, understood. since mention sitting room 10 days, also mean can't go biking alone? I've last days Yes mama! 🙌 How? makes sense. OK, and? Death numbers absolute horseshit - ICU RN What?!!

Fucking HOW?!! skip blood pressure, diabetes, meds might folks. help mess up.  1/8 87% efficacy isn’t it?

And infection turn serious case relatively rare even unvaccinated people (maybe 1 200?), would good term 1/8 relatively rare?  It’s optimistic sounding me, whole idea it’s going stay around forever it’s risk old. So… going lower retirement age 45 then? don’t think current generations going happy endemic covid-19 get older time. There'll probably noticeably less people living soon. Socialism? One state, entire country. People need start conforming. Physicians pharmacists need goimg door door vaccines Masking important never know *might* covid need safe. actively covid know it, it’s disgustingly irresponsible anything sit ass bedroom stay ten days. shouldn’t leaving unless it’s medical treatment. 

Depending are, could facing legal action knowingly going public place actively infectious. I’m really struggling decision send kids school not. 3/4 12 (and therefore vaxxed.) school finally reversed stance require masks thankfully. But, lunch won’t wear masks sit 3 feet apart lunchroom. safe? overreacting put cyber school? OMG...I'm sorry going through. Hang there. 🙏 Lots strawmen there, champ, including ""needs 100% compliance."" leave conservative piss everybody else, turn around say ""it's fault wearing vinyl poncho."" They're longer patients fires them. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ It’s axes (because English mess :p) good enough know vaccinated know breakthrough cases. Nope. know 100 people dont know 100 people level kudos anyone does. 33 percent big fail there. outreach needs done! Blame antivaxxers. reason vaccinated folks can't move around freely. guess is, deployed, either treat non covid patients ships disembark medical professionals render aid local hospitals. Field hospitals flyins likely efficient. guess shall see bad gets Dixie. didnt learn first time shipping stuff made Africa Europe sent back Africa? Tf? open-access plan time allowed see in-network specialist specified copay that

I'm grateful wife able put plan. open enrollment year, we're going plan next year argue covered how, worry deductibles. Little easier Island population 5 million. good comparison make.  3rd vaccine every 8 months. plan check doctor follow recommendation. circle family friends vaccinated, quite got Covid, symptoms fortunately mild. son got Covid Friday. wear masks, social distance wash hands.

Unvaccinated people get virus.

Virus vaccinated people difficult environment prosper spread. antibodies prepared immediately attack it, good success rate.

Virus unvaccinated people perfect environment prosper spread. antibodies prepared attack good success rate.

The time difference two scenarios gives virus time prosper evolve, becoming variant.

These reads like death cults. undercount India, China Brazil alone massive. really clue Africa.

No, New Zealand good Yes, that’s proof vaccinations work it’s wonderful people protected. patients restricted again.

Some rant would gotten into, encouraging students take everything face value may need now. Cue stopping count know xx% vaccinated, percentage people fragile already died, lots others exposed....does anyone know seems disproportionate number deaths now? deaths peak till 3 weeks cases, seeing many deaths right Whats point bullet proof vest still get shot? one. Outside select places retail restaurants dont require masks I'll lucky see 2 3 store. put handful months, blows away.

We know emergency authorization school aged children isn’t far off.

These people couldn’t admit wrong change messaging couple months. vaccine prevents vaccinated developing disease therefore prevents spreading it. 

I don’t know else explain outside simply looking numbers unvaccinated infected, hospitalized dying compared vaccinated. It’s like 90% unvaccinated 10% vaccinated. 71% countries worldwide helmet laws comprehensive scope i.e. require drivers passengers motorized two-wheelers wear helmets roads regardless engine type. [Most Africa, South Asia, USA doesn't.](http://gamapserver.who.int/gho/interactive_charts/road_safety/helmet_law/atlas.html)  Awesome :) I'm nurse got mine May. dramas. Get Vaccinated then. kids 12 finally got shot truly dont need care anymore this. wait til day. lot old people also want live forever say ""If COVID kills me, it"". point we, country, going moral/ethical reckoning respect COVID. going make hard choice, leaving things personal choice negatively affecting safety everyone, vaccinated not. 

In view, 4 logical options:

1. nothing. new variant continue cause ICU's get swarmed, negatively affecting medical care citizens sizable unvaccinated population gets sick.
2. Force vaccinations Americans. 
3. Deny covid related medical care insurance coverage unvaccinated.
4. Establish covid treatment centers keep hospitals available higher mortality illnesses. 

None easy, none pretty, one thing made abundantly clear delta personal choices unvaccinated directly affect life health every American. Brilliant!  Director Rochelle Walensky twice asked month reporters stood earlier statement 97 percent people hospitalized virus unvaccinated, times acknowledged data date. **Her agency yet produce new estimates.**

Surely could compile vaccinated percentage metric for, say, everyone hospitalized July 1 pretty easily.    look forward 1st September. already registered couple weeks ago, awaiting email text message. Probably first time I'm looking forward getting jab. get annual flu shots exactly looking forward them. Except public transport, *right*? *eyeballs you* jabbing 1% pop day moment. We'll get there. states don’t need wear helmet riding motorcycle.  That’s true. That’s said rate death unvaccinated won’t change. children get infected die without measures helped place. 

Children many states worse position last year don’t mask dates distancing place anymore. source back saying? seen Afghanistan that's American 'Intelligence' hope rest country have. here. Maybe say immunocompromised? looks like time requirement level authorization ""at least 28 days"" 2nd shot. track verify health issues maybe get reason. Even could bump couple years would help many people. Don’t want blanket approve 5? 10 right now? 9? Holy hell New cases going NY. ongoing balance countries face keeping country running live lives economy crumble people make living/survive

NZ's economy vastly better shape US UK past year, bounced back fine original lockdown period first started. low unemployment, wages rising, interest rates low, private national debt fraction comparable countries, major day day economic issues NZ systemic ones (like supermarket monopolies distorted housing market) would exist without Covid. lot businesses took temporary hit, made massive profit later everything bounced back pent demand surged (which made look bad came examining got subsidies basis making loss, plenty recorded examples media).

Also, proper wage subsidies, people may lose money, choose starving breaking lockdown. Ordering people stay home without supporting *would* crazy.

All data shows point lives v.s. economy ridiculous false equivalence. Lives required *have* economy, NZ's approach protected its' economy better letting people get sick die keep money flowing. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Posted August 17, 2021
The UMCG conducting research effect COVID-19 vaccines kidney patients, lung transplant patients patients cancer. Tuesday, August 17, first two studies presented results. Vaccinations work sufficiently several patient groups.
 
Family lockdown

During information session interested media, kidney transplant patient explained impact corona life. received kidney transplant 2007 takes medication ensure immune system reject new kidney. patients like her, corona virus especially dangerous: become seriously ill virus risk death considerably greater others.

She family lockdown since beginning pandemic. example, son going school. Although says used it, clear situation taking toll family. many like patient: estimated 500,000 people Netherlands weakened immune systems extra risk pandemic therefore severely restricted cannot do.

Importance effective vaccine

A vaccine works well safe especially important vulnerable people. However, currently available vaccines mainly studied relatively healthy adults. Specific risk groups included studies, limited extent. result, insufficient knowledge immune response vaccine patients known less well-functioning immune system, result congenital disorder, medication transplant chemotherapy immunotherapy cancer.

From ZonMw, eight studies started effect COVID-19 vaccines vulnerable groups. Three coordinated UMCG. studies effect COVID-19 vaccines kidney patients, lung transplant patients patients cancer. first two presented first results Tuesday, August 17.

Effectiveness lung transplant patients

Corona vaccines safe lung transplant patients, good proportion patients undergone lung transplantation, corona vaccination hardly effective, virtually antibodies produced. evident initial results study led lung transplant specialist Erik Verschuuren virologist Coretta van Leer UMCG.

Many patients still fear infection coronavirus daily basis, many live constant quarantine. may benefit third even fourth shot, mostly dependent vaccination coverage immediate environment society.

Patients lung transplants given medications keep bodies rejecting new lungs. drugs suppress immune system, also makes patients susceptible viral infections, coronavirus. coronavirus even dangerous virus infects transplanted organ, lungs. addition, infection lasts longer immune response suppressed.

A corona infection lot dangerous lung transplant patients healthy people. greater chance ending ICU dying corona.

Effect vaccine kidney patients

In Netherlands 12,000 kidney transplant patients use immunosuppressive drugs, 60,000 patients kidney failure 6,000 dialysis patients. research group led internist-nephrologist Jan-Stephan Sanders UMCG investigating immune system response COVID-19 vaccination three patient groups.

The good news: first results show vaccination corona vaccine safe kidney patients. Also good news: first results show immune response patients kidney failure dialysis patients good: two vaccinations produced sufficient antibodies. Whether remains needs investigation. However, apply kidney transplant patients: 43% group antibodies.

Amount antibodies

The researchers also looked amount antibodies people produce extent inhibit virus. too, kidney transplant patients score well: 67% insufficient antibodies produced. usually patients recently received transplant, patients lower kidney function, patients taking multiple immunosuppressive drugs, patients taking immunosuppressive drugs containing substance MMF.

Booster

A solution patients could booster: one extra vaccinations would enable produce sufficient antibodies. researchers going investigate effective applications this. Perhaps help - safe - (temporarily) stop taking certain immunosuppressive drugs vaccinate.

More information

More information study effects corona vaccine people cancer, third study UMCG leading, follow shortly. ZonMw website find information eight studies. also read news item knowledge session here.

Lack freedom underexposed

Because studies structured way, researchers ZonMw hope eventually able draw comparisons various patient groups. applies case stand benefit high vaccination rate among people immediate vicinity society whole. Lung transplant specialist Erik Verschuuren: ""Ultimately remain large group patients able protect corona. discussion freedom everyone Netherlands decide whether vaccinated, remains underexposed. patients often desperate, freedom giving www.DeepL.com/Translator (free version) constituents happy. Fundamentally goes back beginning corporations worried economic impacts turned political science. didnt realize sheer scale idiots exis

Blah blah blah. 

Forcing kids wear masks inhibit ability breath mistake. happy governor allows child freedom. one hand, definitely thing get clicks. risk kids really low. study putting IFR 1/50,000 under-18s original variant. Another study put Delta 2.3x deadly, could bring number some. 500 under-18s died far pandemic (US), number triples would comparable number died annually measles vaccination.

On hand, *we vaccine*. Every one deaths completely unnecessary. we'd vaccinate adults number child deaths could dropped zero.  young kids particular pediatric hospitals, every one worried running beds (presumably really lot spare flu season normally).  There's means enforce. saw happened nyc trying enforce it. action beyond asking disproportionate. Police tools month assume become one things hope people fear unknown/non-existent consequences enough people follow rules makes impact. 100% would ideal 80-90% better none. Berkeley, CA social pressure works well people still put masks outside uncrowded, least college part town. probably fine. might crush get vaccine 12-year-olds. Otherwise quite bit spread vaccination dates general population already getting booster exactly 8 months critical/urgent getting original doses was. Consider term “sex worker”, is, instead “whore”, outdated disgusting word. Oh. My. God. sounds insane. Everyone going get covid rate. sorta like people call ""Carbonated Beverages"": ""Soda"" ""Pop"" depending region. 
Likewise people call ""Vaccinations"": ""Jabs"" ""Shots"" depending region. 
It seems countries part British Empire 20th century tendency use term ""Jabs"" often. Forcing kids wear masks inhibit ability breath mistake. happy governor allows child freedom. problem news pieces people reddit interpreting single result causal generalizable... I'm ready declare difference them.

I'd argue right one 'people reddit' generalizing scientific data asserting believe difference even though scientific paper literally asserting exactly case. clear post 'news piece' talking paper, specifically posted scientific journal reason. random single result 'blurb' buried boarder paper covid, paper specifically testing **comparison two highly-effective mRNA vaccines COVID-19 periods Alpha Delta variant prevalence** title paper. could clearer they're trying test establish. 
""Never read much one data set, peer reviewed not."" ignore scientific data? go gut instinct? glean true true scientifically studies like this. 50,000 small data set. That's many multiples bigger want looking trends. could begin disagree I'll leave saying: trust Mayo Clinic 'people reddit'. Forcing kids wear masks inhibit ability breath mistake. happy governor allows child freedom.  kiwi here, really intrigued things. I'm saying health authorities strategies wrong right apparently fatalities numbers bad, vaccination going ? many hospital beds covid icu beds ? economy, guys working remotely time ? states peaking yet? peak supposed happen around time, right? Yet cases still rising everywhere. I'm really starting think gonna happen. It’s same. You’re comparing habit (or addiction) one-time choice. enough people caught vaccinated threat hospital collapse moment gone. I'm actually really good things aside people sick dying covid. I'm fan social distancing sick since 2019. guess everyone though.  Republican Party trashed public education.   Gov Douchebag - thought Jan Brewer bad but... rational crazy get vaccinated? literally met anyone opinion, think that's bad thing? fucking hero. Here's actual video yr interested actually think many done 2 say screw Yeah good analogy seatbelt, save every car crash? No, would also moron wear one. onion articles sure getting dark.  country delta cases start dropping due vaccinations herd immunity yet. So, know.

The US vaccinating many people, however - 1% per week. think 3rd dose must. anyone think supporters right finally decide big enough threat finally stop trying “stick libz” denying downplaying pandemic? going go ship?

What endgame? win getting really sick? anyone care costs nothing, future inflation due even higher-healthcare costs country already trillions debt aging, unhealthy population? country delta cases start dropping due vaccinations herd immunity yet. So, know.

The US vaccinating many people, however - 1% per week.  Wishful thinking. People refused contemplate delta another variant would render vaccines much less potent regarding transmission blocking. Thank God vaccines still prevent severe disease Get hospital care. think CDC thinks anymore one's gunna want live hermit kingdom. wouldn’t surprised delta started Florida department health either didn’t notice covered up. part even remotely true.  That's less power probably going get fired saying want get potentially life-threatening virus. right now. Oh, afraid monster governors getting press? Seems pretty obvious smart option is!

Thanks that. Anyone taking actions kill children put jail, regardless trying hide behind suit Covid spreads pre-symptomatically already low death rate, almost selective pressure become less deadly.  Texas similar test numbers 100 deaths per day Florida reporting 7? Oh doubt she'll instantly fired. parents dumbasses absolutely stand called dumbasses. Finally That’s mean well. NZ 5 deaths per million US at…1,921. No…. aren’t allowed to.  Teachers need show class they’re charge understand younger people maybe hesitant, riding natural immunity previous positive case, 33% 65+ fucking stupid. terribly risk, half certainly hypertension and/or obese. Ffs. Welp. wrong.   Apparently nothing makes sense. don’t know think happening children wear masks. way make sound it’s development stunted. know what’s worst kids masks? constant instability school right - going school quarantine back school. can’t go one 10 months. real risk you, others kids come contact with. Basically everyone getting virus fall. Masks thing, even leave lunch equation. 1 kid classroom comes covid, everyone classroom leaving covid, 8 hours later.

There science suggests masks would remotely successful stopping spread covid schools. Hope make decision based science. Announcing anything specific announced would stupid. January could new variant something completely different. We've told exactly government making decision, goals are, options considering, information using make decision.

It literally provide information. 

Your issues seem personal looking situation rational way. largely useless last several deployments. one New York quickly became infection hot spot itself.   We're honor system here; mask required vaccinated prove it. Unsurprisingly, areas lowest vaccination rate also lowest use masks public. Seems like there’s lots revisionist history news stories. anti-vaxxers made sound “vaccine hesitant” finally come around wanting shot, contracted virus scheduled appointment “weeks away”. narrative every time.


I’m sure there’s place country need appointment 24 hours get shot point. 1st September vaccines available adults, situation NZ rapidly improve. I'm Thailand rich people would fly California get shots. would advertise tours west coast bookend two shots Pfizer Moderna. J&amp;J’s clinical trial already variants wasn’t much difference one variant next, unlike Pfizer seemed take larger hit beta. J&amp;J also longer ramp (almost 2 months it’s best numbers) may yet need booster. Optimistic think. one case infected 6 tomorrow could potentially see 40 plus 240 etc. goes like locked month least. Friday give us fair idea rate spread. People need realize there's difference undermining confidence vaccine making sure people realize vaccine make fucking invincible. agree extent. Although don’t like it, I’d never argue care actually withheld. People often don’t make best decisions themselves, human.   big part common culture “doing part sake whole”. It’s hard look refusal/avoidance anything dereliction duty fellow citizens, carries stigma. guess schools closing down?  sort natural development technology, information, good bad, easily available people. way fucked, end fine. think nations crazies need get bit. don’t understand downvotes, it’s legit question. I’m curious too. data misleading, though. I'm wrong.

I believe I've repeated 7 times making point, yet respond.

Rebut point move along. getting anywhere repeating position without making substantive argument.  Hopefully NZ manages stop turns endless lockdown situation like parts Australia. Sadopopulists. SoCal Good question. Apparently, every vaccine undergo trials [before licensed presume year's flu vaccine cocktail includes vaccines strains previous years known still active. Plus one two recently developed, recently trialed vaccines. Short answer: appears trial year's flu vaccine. Additionally follow studies monitor effectiveness. Wow, idiot! re-elect even bugger idiots? HMMMM wonder large country's could hiding true death numbers  think schools closed kids perpetual state quarantine better wearing mask? that's what's already starting happen. booster effective. people want imagine.

I think said full agreement paper - I'm copying relevant sections below. clear post 'news piece' talking paper, specifically posted scientific journal reason.

Sorry, mean - lots redditors posting disappointed Pfizer ""not working"" read much one data set, peer reviewed not."" ignore scientific data? go gut instinct? glean true true scientifically studies like this.

Wait data independent replications results. bit cliche scientists always say data needed unfortunately also true. 50,000 small data set. That's many multiples bigger want looking trends. 

I tried pointing 50k people, 15 vs 38 breakthrough infections. data set big overall, direct comparison based fairly small numbers. could begin disagree I'll leave saying: trust Mayo Clinic 'people reddit'.

I'll reiterate points directly copy pasting actual paper. 

I said data needed, actual number cases fairly small. paper real world clinical studies larger diverse 
populations various health systems needed robustly compare effectiveness 
of mRNA-1273 BNT162b2.

I said matching might exact. paper possible vaccine 
effectiveness estimates impacted unknown exposure risk variables missed 
the matching procedure

I warned concluding much one study. paper puts like observational study suggests mRNA COVID-19 vaccines strongly 
protect infection severe disease, differences real-world effectiveness 
relative relative prior months pandemic. Larger studies 
diverse populations warranted guide critical pending public global health decisions, 
such optimal timing booster doses vaccines administered 
individuals yet received one dose. 

This study suggests something, larger studies needed. 

I 100% agree paper says. I'm saying paper actually say know certain percentages timelines are. believe Mayo, read ""the fine print"", limitations etc. I'm paraphrasing them, go whole paper want.

Really, blame antivaxxers. management. Cuz management. every dangerous covid variant come predominantly unvaccinated country. boosters.... Israel statement extremely preliminary, refers reducing hospitalizations 50%. They’re seeing something like 80% reduction hospitalizations vaccinated people, would make 90%.  best it’s purple, state politics still controlled conservatives. Dems eked senate presidential elections pretty thin margins. person US. Here's ranking states weekly deaths per higher vaccination rate, higher percentage breakthrough cases. 

It’s easy simple thought experiment. 2 groups people. 1,000 people each. Group 75% vaccinated Group B 25% vaccinated. 50% group exposed Covid. vaccinated person vaccine 85% efficacy disease. Non vaccinated 10% don’t get infected reason. 

Group A, highly vaccinated one, would 168 total infections 56 breakthrough infections. 33% infections breakthrough group. 

Group B, low vaccinated one, would 356 total infections 19 breakthrough infections. 5% infections breakthrough group 

So, important total number infections less half higher vaccinated group. looks like vaccine doesn’t work well group look percent breakthrough percentage breakthrough rise population vaccinated.

Heart disease cancer capable uncontrolled exponential growth. number people dying spread throughout year fairly evenly (there seasonality, much). number deaths population level predicted fairly accurately. health care system capable ready treat heart disease cancer without overwhelmed.

An infection like covid19 capable explosive growth left unchecked. Think much unprecedented mitigation implemented 2020 social distancing, business shutdowns, masking. Yet Covid19 still killed 345,000 people US, third prolific killer heart disease cancer. next deadliest infectious disease influenza killed 53,000 people. mitigation effort made Covid19, number deaths would orders magnitude worse many many people would infected shorter span time health care system gets overwhelmed. Number people dying non-covid19 related deaths would also skyrocket without working healthcare system. Lmao, serious? literally say exact thing people pro-vaccine, don’t give damn proof/facts/articles saying it’s unsafe. know 1000’s people died vaccine, safe? fucking disgrace. exactlu southern governors chosen play way.

Nobody care couple weeks, maybe month so.

I think thats also oligarchs chosen us go back to

Many needless deaths happen, children included.

I'm thinking Hopium best way govern. weaklings. Plus never.of covid. /s Would cheaper get vaccine. Many countries back normal. They’re still making homework day

Homework relic needs die anyway. mutates viruses do. mutate vaccinated unvaccinated infected people. far mutations epitopes vaccines still preventing serious illness / death. delta two substitutions domain binding receptor makes antibodies less able stop tracks. would less likely virus mutate fit form vaccinated person impossible. 


TLDR: ways virus mutate unvaccinated person become fitter “strain” compared vaccinated person. die preexisting conditions. /s flu called covid rsv called covid. /s Where's ""covid affect children"" crowd lol  Ridiculous hyperbole.   Mexico (data May 23, 2021):

They’re still making homework day. Wtf going on?! Russia (data Apr 30, 2021):

--- official Covid deaths: 110,000

--- total excess deaths: 500,000 someone living AZ I'd like say guy complete fucking moron. sad part living red part state many people around agree him, absolutely insane. think problem total comparison. seemed recall Portugal going quite spike pre-vaccine availability. spike back January higher %wise lasted longer vs Georgia. Fast forward 7 day avg new cases 3x higher Georgia vs. Portugal. Australia deaths said people risk death vaccine Covid.

They’ve revised advice now, destroyed trust vaccine. Paywall undercount US Brazil around 10%.   That’s it’s spreading among unvaccinated people. vast majority people hospitals covid right unvaccinated. also bad look somewhere like cdc data. example since data last days get filled time coming weeks, recent days always least deaths tallied. graph data always show downward trend deaths, totally get miscontrued. asked PCP spike protein antibody test make sure vaccines April took since really gnarly autoimmune issues. apparently regular antibody test, still came back antibodies. I've super cautious still wearing N95 even leave house. got sick once, basically allergies lasted two days. guess vaccine really job exposed even notice it. wouldn’t go school board meetings either. indoor meeting full maskless, shouting covid deniers sounds like good way get sick. I'm sure mean ""doesn’t mRNA"". One advantages mRNA vaccines _don't_ attenuated inactivated virus particles. Theoretically, mRNA vaccines safer traditional vaccines, already safe. completely agree this. think there’s option give parents option vaccinate now, parents given clear consent forms detail risks involved stating carefully side effects known time. know I’ve basically described EUA, know parents don’t even want wait that. want roll dice giving adult dose kid before/as go back school. 
Then FDA continue follow usual process, agree appearance rushing thing going drive anti-vax sentiment. really broadcast everywhere. Vaccines could provide relief healthcare systems worldwide. always show downward trend deaths.

see also georgia tennessee graphs case count that. remarkable made changes around time changes resulted constant appearance peak/decline starting ""a days ago"" What's big deal, like people dying anything. /s case numbers leading indicator. Waiting hospitalization deaths 2-4 weeks more. unvaccinated people hung month ICU died. 20,000 Mississippi alone 2 weeks. Half schools open 1 week.

My shitty state next door won’t start reporting K-12 numbers middle next month even though school week two already. Finally good use dress code

Honestly, every single school country school uniforms. takes much stress away kids. Poor/lower earning families kids worrying newest hippest clothes concentrate important things. easy relatively inexpensive kids wear khakis white blue polos. mean verifiably shitty schools based leaderships reading comprehension. framed time ""If everyone present vaccinated, masks necessary"" could've played differently  Normalizing kids ventilators.

Hence question. crazy expensive? another option, like sort face covering type preventive medical inoculation.  Ok actually makes perfect sense. Yeah guess use comment check back next weeks see numbers change.

Curious make numbers look bad. Humorous depending site look today makes look like deaths plummeting FL. data get backfilled theory always show downward trend deaths.

Wait official guidance. Anecdotally, havent heard jnj recipients winding hospital getting super sick. think we’re fine… now. 🤪  seems general sentiment. think self-treat anti-malaria horse anti-parasite medicine. Wow- coincidence it’s specific states. Wonder there’s sort correlation? Weirdness. changed way report week ago. report deaths paperwork order (i.e. death certificate) day person died. deaths reported recent day low grow coming weeks paperwork completed.

Problem sites scrape data call good. see low number previous day initially reported, never updated. I'm hearing period exposure symptoms 2-3 days Delta. Anyone reading likely superspreader events within elementary schools? hard assess risk transmission still likely family transmission.  Sometime February recorded highest death day barely hit 5,000 deaths single day.

Yesterday 1,017. No, would change anything. year ago, maybe. people committed ""camp"". One issues they're going bring home doubt quarantine rest family student mine tested positive, test me. 

That might aspect cluster busting. low *k* value Covid, forward testing useful (because 80% cases caused less 20% infected individuals, maybe less 20%, forward tracing negative), less fruitful trace students new contacts. Tracing backwards figure student infected likely hit cluster cases (which also result high case positivity), may better use limited contact tracing resources. 

Again, valid strategy older strains may work Delta, likely outstrip contact tracing efforts. press Japan ""free"" lot saving face shame get COVID

That's true. hand, excess death figures excessive. Same. guess typo author. Moderna, believe, one setting trials 6 cutoff Pfizer 5 cutoff.

It’s almost like responsible following science helping us… 🤷‍♂️ fine - feds enough Freedom Freezers. correct. 7 day average 150 deaths per day Florida.

That likely 200 day next week.

And, yes, intentionally fucking data cousin Cletus think ""but deaths"" I've seen morons post exact thing. Facebook rational. Great idea, let's both. Everyone's vaccinated negative test. work fairly large hospital system we've coming office twice week. add third day whatever reason Delta kept us two days.

I'm still slightly drunk night before, probably something it.

WFH tough, lol. anybody know time White House update today expected recommended boosters scheduled? virus load. took sustained exposure original strain catch - people.10-15 minutes exposure. need inhale enough it. 

Delta \*extremely\* transmissible. least 10x. I've seen numbers like 60x, means takes seconds become infected. wonder. Parents too, whether psycho parents assaulting teachers masks parents disappointed schools trying push person learning.  someone explain non US citizen country's state allowed kill people? laws place something president prevent that? Hospitalizations top past surge too??? I'm talking decline UK cases November lockdown, released prematurely everyone convinced drop cases November would lead drop deaths December, really happen   win people Louisiana sincerely held religious convictions reservations vaccines,

Playing religion card? Seriously? get COVID, course pass on. However, data showing vaccinated people fight virus shorter period time reducing time window infect others. asymptomatic cases fewer media likes push. optimistic hope people vaccinated would cautious feel cough sore throat coming on.

School starts couple weeks Philly, thankfully mask mandates. city also climbing vaccine front. dont agree smart vaxxed I'm done living solitude went family gathering almost 2 weeks ago now, 30 people vaxxed, guess covid cases Covid farming catch education though? catch years lost socialization? know long term impact this? Plus schooling get fully masked.- impact kids?

I’m tired told things important. risks low continue isolating kids like this. Remote learning effective frankly hell earth parents work home, especially young kids. shaming parents want kids person schooling needs stop. someone homeschooled idea homework ducking ridiculous. school 5 hours day rest day whatever hell wanted. Went college, go basically straight As, great job now. 

Acting like making children work longer hours 90% adults fucking absurd Admin basicly says attack school property gaf. Wait til get new new strain. Thanks info, really useful Yeah, Northeast needs crack now. Exponential growth still exponential. Damn... 1500 covid card. That's crazy still permanently lose smell long term sexual disfunction. booster help that. listening podcast two people health organization (it’s morning forgive can’t remember) pretty much said due society kids likely get approval vaccine required schools due anti-vaccine movement. One said would prefer older generation get kids since risk. 

I’ve got 10 year old, pissed off. Sadly imagine expect schools give quarantining proceed pandemic happening. true, they'd actually valid reasons doubt data. I'm probably overthinking it, really give shit scientific rigor anyway. Yeah, standing army, latest fighter planes, building aircraft carriers, missiles free lot money. colony foreign country depend protection. need say. make us better, right? 

Speaking which, rich nations still suffering COVID? supposed eradicate COVID wealth have. still like 35 k daily cases Two messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech Moderna) encoding spike protein SARS-CoV-2 induce production spike antibodies neutralize SARS-CoV-21 clinically effective COVID-19.2 vaccines elicit greater local systemic reactions persons prior SARS-CoV-2 infection.3 Whether symptoms following vaccination associated effectiveness unknown, and, therefore, anxiety arise persons develop reaction following vaccination.4 evaluated symptoms following vaccination serum spike antibody levels cohort hospital workers (HWs) received either mRNA vaccine known status prior SARS-CoV-2 infection identify differences symptoms serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies S1 spike protein. 
 
Methods 
In June 2020, HWs Johns Hopkins Health System provided oral informed consent participate longitudinal study S1 spike antibodies serum samples survey responses collected every 3 4 months. Ethical approval obtained Johns Hopkins University Institutional Review Board. HWs participated study visit March 10 April 8, 2021, included analysis serum sample collected 14 days receiving dose 2 either mRNA vaccine. Using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Euroimmun), IgG antibody measurements determined based optical density ratios upper threshold 11 based assay saturation.1 Prior SARS-CoV-2 infection defined (1) positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction test result prior 14 days dose 2 (2) S1 spike IgG measurement greater 1.23 prior vaccination.5 Participants self-reported symptoms following vaccination none, mild (injection site pain, mild fatigue, headache), clinically significant (fatigue, fever, chills). Logistic regression models used explore association prior SARS-CoV-2 infection vaccine type symptoms following dose, adjusting sex age. linear regression model used explore association magnitude antibody response (log-transformed) age, sex, prior infection, vaccine type, symptoms, time 2 doses vaccine. Analyses performed R, version 4.0.2 (R Foundation). 
 
Results 
A questionnaire serum sample collected 14 days following dose 2 954 HWs. Clinically significant symptoms reported 52 954 (5%) dose 1 407 (43%) dose 2. adjusting prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, age, sex, odds clinically significant symptoms following either dose higher among participants received Moderna vs Pfizer vaccine (dose 1: odds ratio \[OR\], 1.83; 95% CI, 0.96-3.50; dose 2: OR, 2.43; 95% CI, 1.73-3.40) (Table). Prior SARS-CoV-2 exposure associated increased odds clinically significant symptoms following dose 1 (OR, 4.38; 95% CI, 2.25-8.55) dose 2 (OR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.36-0.99), controlling vaccine type, age, sex. 
 
Regardless symptoms, vast majority participants (953 954, greater 99.9%) developed spike IgG antibodies 14 days following dose 2; 1 participant taking immunosuppressant medication develop IgG antibodies (Figure). Reporting clinically significant symptoms, age younger 60 years, female sex, receipt Moderna vaccine, prior SARS-CoV-2 exposure independently associated higher median IgG measurements, adjusting time dose 2. 
 
Discussion 
Nearly 100% HWs study mounted strong antibody response spike protein dose 2 SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine independent vaccine-induced reactions. Clinically significant symptoms following dose 1 associated prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, confirming prior reports.4 Clinically significant symptoms following vaccination frequent following dose 2 receipt Moderna vaccine.3 
 
This study included participants within longitudinal cohort study, leading 2 potential limitations. First, timing survey collection may led recall bias affected symptom reporting. Second, immune response measured enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay neutralizing antibody titers. 
 
Spike IgG antibody measurements higher HWs received Moderna vaccine, prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, reported clinically significant reactions. role higher antibody levels preventing COVID-19 providing lasting immunity remains unknown, however. Overall, findings suggest regardless vaccine reactions prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, either spike mRNA vaccine provide robust spike antibody response. 12 year olds coming. think arrested ""stealing cards"" *selling* 125 authentic CDC vaccination cards 11 different buyers approximately $10 per card

This doesn’t mean vaccines don’t work, much better vaccinations elderly US. 

For example, country vaccinated 100% elderly, 100% deaths elderly would vaccinated. overall total death much lower. UK came pretty close full vaccination elderly. 

In US, think max ~75% vaccination vulnerable populations. Many people die here, mostly unvaccinated. first article linked refers place 50% vaccinated. Ofc kind places majority hospitalisations unvaccinated. 

The next two using data June, pre delta.

The third I'm really sure point trying make it.

It's using data 3 months, may June July, overall covid deaths US low. many people died covid 3 months US? 

I talking UK, sorry specified that. UK see happens vast vast majority old people vaccinated. COVID antibodies virus nowhere near strong getting vaccine: give fuck, sense one. complete disregard sort science based fact situation. 

I dont get morons, get vaccine. Nothing push point. mind still political issue ""tyrannical government forming, put muzzles mean masks back on."" Lunatics.

For record I'm vaccinated (BioNtech), get THIRD dose exact vaccine within 10months seems leap faith vs, sound science. now, thanks you, didn’t wait long quality answer — thank you! Healthcare workers first wave groups way past 8 months September ""Christians"" follow Pope. Catholics do. Speculation. Tired people saying there's science back it. We've already seen delaying -2nd- dose vaccine 12weeks greatly increases immunity opposed giving usual 3/4weeks. There's reason assume booster 8months provide additional 8-12months immunity. T-Cells/B-Cells, mature time, involved - there's way this. 
 
Furthermore, many vaccines still trial. There's thought nasal vaccine may work produce immunity upper airway Delta (and replication speed) seem exploit. 
 
Anyway, run w/ ""oh forever"" disregard research progress we've made. We're less 2yrs w/ highly effective vaccines. need see boosting schedules continue research better methods prevent infection.

You say, get first vaccine offered you, instead ""shopping around"" better one, leave die. don’t understand this. hell going on? brought school spread around. two kids college online last year (GMU VCU) tell universities awful it. professors prepared proved opposite tech savvy. can't imagine K-12 teachers/schools better.

It's national shame. Good know, wife got J&amp;J vaccine wondered right move retrospect. Haven’t gotten sick attention seems Moderna vaccine   No, they’re willing *other* people die it. 8 month would late November/early December, got J&amp;J. contact trace? people tracing. scales size population? # people perform contact tracing. need willing greater # people working problem effort right size population size. large country excuse contact tracing effectively.

These arguments “larger population country can’t x” often ignores fact people, bigger population tap solve problem. need higher someone every 1k people solve problem easily that. Sure logistical overhead larger, overhead may amortized greater size effort may easier something larger. example though, one says things like “The US populous NZ going hardware store harder US.” Well that’s obviously bs number hardware stores staff stores larger US scales population.

Your point island definitely valid. It’s easier control points entry vast majority people come ports airports. soon say. heartening death rate 80% lower infection rates February.

One possible problem know death rate increase cases exceed hospital capacity US south. hope stays low. think stretch say people every company can't work fully home, firm work fully remote past year, either way, would someone working home affect can't? jealousy? come across gloating you? It’s weird month two ago India headlines record cases deaths suddenly got everything control real logical explanation. best guess still protected delta fully vaccinated may effective original strain. booster shop it'll get back original state highly protected.

Okay, still get job done fine can't keep this? *bud-a-dum TISH!* 🥁 record I'm vaccinated (BioNtech) anti-vaxx, however think jumping quick solutions accepting best case scenarios without question. hope consistently advocating mandatory vaccination, then.

Slightly nuanced that. right self-determination. Choosing vaccinate however, mind, comes giving access public places (schools, groceries, stores, government buildings). current US administration refusal support RealID style vaccine certification problem. also need professional enforcement. Police law enforcement allowed decide laws enforce - need way send law enforcement jobs home without pay, complicated election sheriffs example jurisdictions. appropriate point private business employees making $12/hour enforce public health requirements. 

To point, understand people medically appropriate vaccination. support exemptions religious philosophical grounds. Get jab stay public entirely.  Pfizer BioNTech submitted data Exactly. think that's often people say ""source?"" Instead checking something even insurance refuses pay still picked up? pay yearly flu shots? 
Even free shot pay service much anyways? Seriously get self pay flu shot around 20 labor shot. So.since shot free labor normal place.shoukdnt much? Antibodies wane. means level protection drops time.

That mean protection, course; still T-Cells. without active antibodies, means it'll take longer body mount effective defense.

You mean *leading cause death* US. people died COVID cancer, COVID second largest cause death US right now. need stop acting like sky falling numbers like this, kids clearly face much larger risks lives every day COVID surge

The issue small number sick children, numbers sick children *rising rapidly*. Additionally, cannot protected currently.

That's assuming antivaxxers evenly distributed population, much higher death rate risk factors. could correlation antivax risk factors (such age) Centers Disease Control Prevention released three studies Wednesday federal officials said provided evidence booster shots Pfizer-BioNTech Moderna coronavirus vaccines would needed Americans coming months.

But experts said new research support decision recommend booster shots Americans.

Taken together, studies show although vaccines remain highly effective hospitalizations, bulwark provide infection virus weakened past months.

It’s unclear whether decline protection infection result waning immunity, drop precautions like wearing masks, rise highly contagious Delta variant — combination three.

“We concerned pattern decline seeing continue months ahead, could lead reduced protection severe disease hospitalization death,” Dr. Vivek Murthy, surgeon general, said White House news briefing Wednesday.

Citing data, federal health officials outlined plan Americans received two vaccines get booster shots eight months receiving second doses, starting Sept. 20.

Some scientists deeply skeptical new plan.

“These data support giving additional doses vaccine highly immunocompromised persons nursing home residents, general public,” said Dr. Celine Gounder, infectious disease specialist Bellevue Hospital Center former adviser pandemic administration.

Boosters would warranted vaccines failing prevent people ending hospitalized Covid-19, said.

“Feeling sick like dog laid bed, hospital severe Covid, good enough reason,” Dr. Gounder said. “We’ll better protected vaccinating unvaccinated around world.”

It’s unclear whether third dose would help people produce robust response first two doses, said Bill Hanage, epidemiologist Harvard T.H. Chan School Public Health.

The recommendation boosters may also end undermining confidence vaccines, warned: “A third shot add skepticism among people yet receive one dose vaccines help them.”

Together, new studies indicate overall vaccines effectiveness roughly 55 percent infections, 80 percent symptomatic infection, 90 percent higher hospitalization, noted Ellie Murray, epidemiologist Boston University.

“Those numbers actually good,” Dr. Murray said. “The group data would suggest boosters for, me, immunocompromised.”

The drop protection infection could result increased exposure highly contagious variant period unfettered social interactions, added: “This seems like real possibility, since many early vaccinated motivated desire see friends family get back normal.”

Dr. Murray said boosters would undoubtedly boost immunity individual, benefit may minimal — obtained easily wearing mask, avoiding indoor dining crowded bars.

The administration’s emphasis vaccines undermined importance building precautions people’s lives ways comfortable sustainable, building capacity testing, experts said.

“This part think administration’s focus vaccines damaging morale,” added. “We probably won’t going back normal anytime soon.”

Before people begin receive boosters, Food Drug Administration must first authorize third dose mRNA vaccines made Pfizer-BioNTech Moderna, advisory committee C.D.C. must review evidence make recommendations.

One new C.D.C. studies analyzed effectiveness vaccines among residents nearly 4,000 nursing homes March 1 May 9, Delta variant’s emergence, nearly 15,000 nursing homes June 21 Aug. 1, variant dominated new infections country.

The vaccines’ effectiveness preventing infections dropped 75 percent 53 percent dates, study found. evaluate vaccines’ protection severe illness.

Nursing homes required report number immunized residents June 6, “makes comparisons time challenging,” Dr. Murray said. “It’s fully possible vaccine effectiveness reported hasn’t actually declined time.”

The decline effectiveness also could resulted spread Delta variant, Dr. Gounder said.

“It makes sense give extra dose vaccine vaccinated nursing home residents, even bigger impact protecting nursing home residents vaccinate caregivers,” said. Many heath aides long-term care facilities remain unvaccinated.

A second study evaluated data New York State May 3 July 25, Delta variant grew represent 80 percent new cases. effectiveness vaccines preventing cases adults declined 91.7 percent 79.8 percent time, study found. vaccines remained effective preventing hospitalizations.

During weeks, New York recorded 9,675 breakthrough infections — roughly 20 percent total cases state — 1,271 hospitalizations vaccinated people, accounted 15 percent Covid-19 hospitalizations.

Although fully immunized people ages got infected virus, vaccine effectiveness showed sharpest drop, 90.6 percent 74.6 percent, people aged 18 49 years — often least likely take precautions likely socialize.

Data Israel suggested immunity infection waned among vaccinated adults 65 older. New York data, effectiveness vaccines group barely budged.

Adults ages 65 older likely hospitalized age groups, regardless vaccination status. vaccines show decline effectiveness hospitalizations age groups.

The third study C.D.C. found vaccines showed 90 percent effectiveness hospitalizations country, “which excellent,” Dr. Gounder noted.

The vaccines less protective hospitalization immunocompromised people. “But immunocompromised persons respond additional dose vaccine,” Dr. Gounder noted.

To protect vulnerable individuals, everyone around vaccinated continue wear masks, added.

The vaccines may appear less effective clinical trials trials conducted emergence highly contagious Delta variant. vaccines also seem lose effectiveness unvaccinated people become infected virus gain natural immunity.

If preventing infection goal, would wiser offer booster nasal spray vaccine, better inducing immunity nose throat, virus enters, Dr. Gounder said.

[...] Yes, Pfizer distributed everywhere world. Nigeria got 4 million shipment Moderna applies sides comparison. every child dies bus accident, many dozens suffer long term injury - 10,000 injuries per year, fact.

And alarm you, common cold also cause severe long term injury, including death, rare cases. “Rare” means something like 1 2 people per 100,000. 

And course, that’s viruses happen notice cause respiratory symptoms. Scientists estimate 300,000 different viruses infect mammals like humans. imagine harmless, really knows?

Vaccines available kids 12. supposed send kid school vaccination possible? wife cannot work home virtual alternative.

Forgoing vaccination going public voluntary reasons eligible vaccination required attend school. - limit covid beds unvaxxinated. someone fully vaccinated (let's ignore partially) suffers breakthrough case, see reason limit them. shit, got pfizer five months ago got moderna booster two days ago. moderna made way sicker. hope don’t die Yup this. Delta replicates fast. think future nasal vaccine sprays B-Cells get stored near alert body start making antibodies faster.  don’t know you’re talking you’re getting people amped reason. don’t know vax passports work boosters. Stop. Oh sure, lord knows ship wasn’t really useful New York, point anyone decides send ship anywhere, hurricane really major concern. think best model maintain office non-permanent workstations plenty meeting spaces get best worlds.

I working home since pandemic recognize advantage personally meeting people work with. 

I sure would love job 100% remote without ever meeting anyone face face.  Cautiously optimistic worst spreading. Hospitalization peak might week two off. course kids started school, might change drastically soon.

Check waste water Covid surveillance Los Angeles also lot less virus water compared hospitalization previous waves. It’s love working them. They’re intelligent adults, haven’t “picked sides” tied identity person, group, etc.. much willing open-minded things logical point view. what's end game here? know efficacy wanes time/8 months, need annual semi-annual boosters going forward? buying time once? employer, even though many employees job remote public facing, higher ups want ""well so-and-so gets work remote can't I"" situation coming employees told need on-site whatever reason. I'm polishing ol' resume going look different job allows remote work. need work remote per se, actually like office, lack empathy turning blind eye everything learned past 18 months, that's kind place want work for. family got Covid 11 days ago. never got sick tested negative yesterday. They're getting allowed leave soon however I'm still required wait extra 10 days even though tested Negative? makes family less contagious me? unvaccinated getting hit contagious. Vaccines still cover Things seeming much better month ago, planned trip. things gotten bad again. covid-19; people seem drastically crazier. wear mask, want trapped plane acting loonies. So, alas, canceling trip road trip remote hiking destination instead. Still cool, just...depressing come back something else/further away hiking mind. Yes quite lot kids even take flu vaccine. kids least likely affected Covid compared older people unless underlying conditions.

No I'm terrified extremely unlikely. countries like UK even vaccinating 16s unless they're risk think recently opened 16s despite approved now. forgive, would mind joined evangelicals hell news outlet determining stating anything SCARY?!?!?! It’s rather silly look infections 50s older adults. Older younger adults live, work, interact can’t huge numbers infections young without spreading old.  sure downvoted, you, I’d still go get booster it’s authorized not.  Protection flu vaccines short lived. say little 2-3 months only. that’s hoping got formulation right predict strains target. It’s better wait possible. Heard interview doctor NPR last year saying wife actually got 2 flu shots. theories suggested might ‘prime’ innate immune system bit towards COVID, nothing conclusive.   Unless it’s new variant infected 7 people. USA also thrown away many doses already. shithole situation. volunteered vaccine site SD idiots drove yell staff. Lol saying might concerning due time takes?  quote Misery... bat-shit-crazy person quoted it, like Governor Florida. could pick date people would find something wrong it. Many companies, included STILL need office space house infrastructure. cant put hundreds thousands dollars secure commercial network hardware someones basement. video news report quotes Superintendent saying ""No charges filed... time."" apparently not. think that's ridiculous dangerous. actually really interesting question far complex ""yes"" answer got.

It really boils concept sterilizing immunity versus immunity illness. Sterilizing immunity immune response strong enough stop infection even taking hold. viral infection would mediated circulating serum mucosal antibody levels. remain high enough virus neutralized antibodies without ever taking hold. means could exposed virus without rest immune system activated again. virus would enter, bound antibodies already made, would nothing left stimulate additional response. antibodies maintained cells called long-lived plasma cells sit bone marrow act antibody producing machines whatever pathogen generated fight. name suggests long lived (on order decades lifetimes typically though vary) also efficient producing high antibody titers.

Now cells may always enough. Either due amount virus initial exposure, death plasma cells time, producing quite high enough titers stop infection. happens virus would get past initial response actually infect you. would trigger rest immune response, case since already vaccinated, mainly memory B cells would job restart antibody production clear infection. would act booster generate strong response again.

In case since testing negative likely means one two things. 1. child secreting enough virus truly exposed. 2. titers high enough sterilizing immunity getting infected all. likely means getting ""booster"" could mean vaccine worked well start.

-An Immunologist Exponentially sad see. simple changing date. point normalize data account fact total population vaxxed unvaxxed individuals changed throughout year. chart exact problem many charts antivaxers point make opposite claim you. &lt;12 get lower vaccine dosage. 10μg per dose vs 30μg per dose standard vaccine Use relative risk (RR) hazard ratio, ""immunity boost"" really well-defined term. ""What applies them, case, stand benefit high vaccination rate among people immediate vicinity society whole.""

There way except high vaccination rates, options government policies every single country need reflect fact. Yep, like viruses. assume maybe article kinda fear mongering stuff, fear anticipation, like pointed out. misunderstand. Yes, fired reporting accurately wanted play data anymore: “Coadministration COVID-19 vaccines vaccines” section:

*COVID-19 vaccines vaccines may administered without regard timing. includes simultaneous administration COVID-19 vaccine vaccines day, well coadministration within 14 days.* equally foreseeable vaccinated person could contracted Covid attend event, argument null void. False negatives significant problem.

So OK locking people *can't* vaccinated social events rest lives? yet able, example 18s, practically necessary reason? mention; world outside US many adults yet able vaccinate either. suck stay home another year, feel superior?

In summary, *you* need suck accept unvaccinated people also right participate society, long reasonably prove safe. need setup massive temporary vaccination centers again?   shitty situation, think job(s) happy go wind getting bunch people work sick.

Maybe call ask want, least, see work masked. may using even home computers rather company ones

Not company security protocols.

Going remote actually costs company office. provide tech budget employees, spend considerable amount money improve network security due allowing remote access, hire additional company manage in-home tech support, still maintain office hardware infrastructure is. recently tried conversation someone masks schools. (very heated) response others like don’t take kindly physical threats children. isn’t lot willingness hear reasonable conversation. sure won’t attempt again. dude unhinged. Almost certainly testing positive, far important metric since get close 100%. Efficacy hospitalization test positive already high-but-not-exceptional (70% UK data), it'll take much larger sample size determine rises drops time.

But also reduction versus 2-dose baseline, really actually getting pretty close 100% delta. Amazing news. PREACH! Boosting population vaccinating world isn’t binary choice. reality could donate every extra dose tomorrow due poor infrastructure/cold storage many places would still able vaccinate people - also anti-vaxx sentiment isn’t unique United States. much bigger problem donating doses/foregoing boosters. problem isn’t don’t understand, problem don’t care due selfishness. No, trying say vaccines effective. See history Ding ding ding

I've frustrated angry total write-off Southeast. lot vaccinated terrified parents here, too. 

From Feds ""blue"" states, I'm shocked sanctimonious ""what do"" attitude simultaneously assuming they'll somehow immune. link posted shows asking for, even look?

Then math link find much worse covid case per case putting risk exactly? *Dies*  larger dosages mRna candidtates. Gimme Also logic us don’t need get flu shot, us going get sick days flu. Yet, doctors recommend flu shots still. Personally take days get flu shot every year don’t want laid bed sick dog days, think flu kill get it, know odds someone age good health almost 0. 

If it’s matter supply country, get people hold 3rd they’re able provide initial dose that’s issue U.S. - demand problem supply problem. I'm Canadian I've planned trip various parts US late Nov/early Dec. Right now, one big question mark. Lol thanks... guess really thinking said ""this probably already asked 50,000 times today alone people going downvote question oblivion."" 😛 headlines interesting focus case number hysteria, rather rational look serious illness death. 
The article gives recent day's mortality that, occurred every single day year, would equivalent accident mortality rate UK, percentage no-one ever lost sleep over. I'd assume US probably comparable worse stats accidents, although that's guess.
If US cases pre-vaccination case levels, deaths (and serious illnesses stay roughly proportional mortality), good sign vaccination worked well elderly vulnerable. 
Once folk heads around idea virus stay ""zero covid"" ever fantasy then, perhaps, realistic comparisons causes mortality start drawn, undermining media's desire keep selling news. cost whom? Everything price. Parent suffers cognitive dissonance. uncommon phenomenon. I’d happy COVID treatment denied folks haven’t gotten vaccine. morons believe bullshit claim believe shouldn’t anyone problem this.  right ""8 month"" timeline booster shot based public policy concerns rather individual needs? articles floating sub say Pfizer drops protection infection Delta four months. Breakthrough infections going happen regardless. Antibodies certainly wane, memory cells savage. Eventually breakthrough infections become white noise virus become endemic.

They say vaccine’s effectiveness severe COVID still remains high, they’re afraid may wane, they’re playing safe expense helping vaccinate rest world. right choice? knows?

Many, many experts problem this. data cite doesn’t support need boosters general public, immune compromised extreme elderly.

Interesting debate! Maccabi Healthcare Services study, first kind world, surveyed 149,144 people received booster shot control group 675,630 people received second shot January February. former, 37 tested positive, compared 1,064 latter. first group surveyed week receiving third dose. 

To clear, 86% effective compared two doses, **not** compared unvaccinated. Hope doesn’t end supplies competing boosters &lt;12 group gets approved them. Fair enough, judgment anyone wears mask wherever are. time though, shade thrown people outdoors wearing mask, long vaccinated. know honor system working whole system messed up, that's whole discussion. vaccinated I'm passing someone outside, appreciate dirty looks I've gotten time time. long people following CDC guidelines, that's expect (and even that's proven much lots people, unfortunately). depends end point care about. preventing hospitalizations deaths goal, they're needed general population. want people vaccinated get sick, they're useful. don’t think that’s saying. read 99% 80s vaccinated. wrong, much (it’s like 95%) Absolute numbers necessary understand degree hospitalization pressure

I’ve seen weird arguments that, taking Israel figures, news shouldn’t report “519 hospitalized, 66% vaccinated” instead say something (magic numbers) like “13 per 100k unvaccinated, 4 per 100k vaccinated”. doesn’t make goddamn sense, imagine people asking children hospitalizations reported relative numbers “they don’t tell whole story” same. Went see family June; glad went did.  
About likely cancel family coming see next month (I went alone; parents understandably want see kids.) Superspreaders apparently less feature delta, already spreads easily. rather small proportion infected people lot spreading, pretty much anyone infect room. exclusively *their* freedom care about, freedom everyone. want freedom dictate others do. that's exactly moronic sounds. Hybrid essential many fields. level collaboration required many fields necessitates person, engaged team discussions. tried 100% remote work. one day office per week address issues simply cannot productive remotely. I’m pretty sure everyone agrees vaccinated undeniably better unvaccinated. When's first day? could get test feel better going sister survived Covid pre-vaccine, later got J J shot, fairly strong side effects. says even though side effects literally put sick bed, take day Covid.  going road, we've ever known at? headlines make top sub students quarantining locations require masks. 

I strongly suspect lots places mask mandates ample spread, stories make sub play nice confirmation bias masks work Delta variant. Yeah, shocked — absolutely ecstatic — numbers hold up. Maybe I’m negative, delta seems drifted enough pretty slippery infection.

If third booster gets us close alpha immunity was, things looking rosy while. last time hit 1k day? kids die nurse bruised egos. JFC. reading?

That report literally shown me.

the US excess mortality rate actually 900k+

the UK around 200k

other developed European countries also add extra 30 - 60k mortality rate.

Japan went 12k around 120k.

If take death divided respective population.... Japan comes top nearly every time. Yes I've reading exactly sent see problem 100 Tokyo hospitals reiected man seeking inpatient treatment Japan's hard-hit areas admit extremely ill people treatment Japanese medical professionals completely admit breakdown healthcare infrastructure.

When Japan admitted hospital ""breaking down"" meaning still wiggle room.

When US admitted hospital breaking down, truly breaking thats death rate skyrocketed. called reactive proactive management. Apparently decision hinges hospitalization rates vaccinated.

Checking CDC hospitalization data, see hospitalizations currently climbing steeply breakdown vax vs unvax.

But steepest subset group also vaccinated. take evidence elderly immunity may running steam. many group already nearly 8 months. I'm almost 7 among first vaccinated.

This issue resolved months. timeframe now.  Yeah figured.   They’re saying get booster 8 months second dose first groups ones got vaccinated dec/jan healthcare workers elderly mostly.  Delta contagious. reference, measles contagious disease existence, need 93-95% population immune measles reach herd immunity.

They pay parents’ mistakes.  I'm denying way shape form natural infection induces good immune response, clear.

What conveniently ignoring cells bone marrow produce antibodies, memory cells, also produce antibodies vaccination. seeing waning protection vaccines? Antibody numbers decrease time. Sure, memory cells present kick high gear getting infection faster, 100%. like natural immunity 100%.

 said re-infections occur, occur higher rates unvaccinated populations. give another added layer protection? ""natural booster"" every time exposed comes risk time, especially someone immunocompromised. ""forgotten"" basic science.

Right. think overall cost factored policy discussion effectiveness, means masks win per unit cost basis, although obviously edge vaccines medical benefits.

And come find much staffing related.
 
 So, honest approach would make story seems like bad situation many hospitals short staffed. Cases signs slowing one wants impose meaningful restrictions again. ICUs Pediatric cases highest level ever been. Pediatric ICUs Doctors come said hot spot kid gets sick injured wait another kid bed open up. Delta effecting kids severely data strongly showing that. covid that's issue pediatric hospitals full kid needs appendix need wait. covid snowball effect.

Now I'm saying need go full blown lockdown. can't keep lying covid over. know serious longterm effects covid. mortality rate quality life. would want subject kids life long illness simple mask mandates social distancing keep cases low vaccinated. wasn't. pushed FUD way often promoted vaccine. Let's even pretend ever even made full-throated endorsements.

He’s gonna get cured really quick still oppose type mask mandate  available everyone. it’s $1500/dose currently paid California three times many active cases Florida right yet double population. sounds like unfettered spread me. read typed?? agree insinuation , clarified mine. Antivax mostly American issue, spreading rampant America partially due antivax mentality. 

If Americans vaccinated, would spread wildly America. 

What getting?  100% agree saying. NYT article implied Israeli MoH slide deck report, somewhere Internet, available public, presumably detail. can't find it! want to...since detail may include data, methodology, confidence intervals, context... Nah. made tons mistakes dragged feet never helped. One bullshit outburst reporter cut enough.  tax dollars afford it. Doubt ever get arrested hard drives thing Hoping soon!!! Prey babies stay well till then.  Take care. Imagine refusing provided prevention measures ask help afterwards. source shows California deaths per million higher Florida's spite Florida older population complete lack restrictions. Florida higher case count per million also shows three times many active cases California right now. think stats damning seem think are. america, would've helped lot....yanno, antivax people are?

I’m really sorry loss! add, “clinically mild” != walk park either. I’ve mentioned elsewhere, point know 6 friends breakthrough Delta, p-town cluster. two sniffles/congestion, others really sick — like basically bed week almost month later still slowly regaining smell full energy. They’re mild none needed go doctor, describe worst flu gotten years. One even previously original COVID said breakthrough infection felt milder that. 

Just vaccination hugely protective hospitalization doesn’t mean battle over. still lot suffering shouldn’t sweep rug. 

As immunocompromised person really feel story. pandemic could keep condition nobody would know I’m different them. point COVID become increasingly necessary disclose condition. It’s reminder healthy folks there: immunocompromised people often look act like normal people. probably friend risk category never found necessary share that. person care anymore? stats favor I'm get second shot. shit going anywere. wrong getting life? Are...are suggesting bomb everyone covid? Hope not. Immunologist follow saying hopefully Sept oct. Hope sooner rather later get hold up. Right it’s single dose required. don’t think get boosters anytime soon. Booster shots started yesterday NYC immunocompromised. people get covid trials considered “breakthrough infections”?

Never mind Sweden ultimately showed us herd immunity much elusive previously thought, GOP pretty fixated taking approach Got it. sucks still needs approval. 1 month thing bit misnomer. third party studies info

Like published study itself? attractive talking heads? Dr. Firstname? Convincing reddit posts?

I've working people too, really hard figure convince them, times things really *should not* convince anyone make people willing get it. kind baffling frustrating time.  Donating Covax often happens paper first. country sees need much vaccines likely receive September, tells producer send X doses vaccine Covax instead. vaccines trickle throughout September, rerouted country need.

The ""on paper"" thing important, need rely producer actually able fulfil contract first place. Germany said future Astrazeneca deliveries sent directly Covax instead. relies Astrazeneca actually able deliver, know could end. one simple, evil thing Republicans. want move tax dollars private religious charter schools. thing happening Florida. certainly hope so. less. ""mild"" cases still basically lay person would called severe 2019. Im calling next deadly covid variant come Florida Yes It’s personal choice. also insurance company choice insured people since condition preventable. Unvaccinated people pay higher premium expose risk. put end madness. Felt like living third world country US. Yes exactly, data July six months eight never care severe outcome themselves. people poisoned thrown common sense window. political culture war longer care science says. Haha fair enough used live Afghanistan. Many Afghans poor since US brought much money many jobs. Even drawdown, Kabul booming millions residents. doubt masks mean worked hospital.  get it. motivation encourage people protect get sick? stupid/willfully ignorant? plain evil? 
You can't healthy economy everyone sick, can't constituency everyone sick. make sense. People vaccine definitely filling icu rooms. It’s mostly unvaccinated. post literally USA....... Since Abbott thread closed, someone tell exactly managed get 3rd booster dose recently getting monoclonal antibody treatment? Like regular person like got Covid, would give monoclonal antibodies even hospitalized? Walgreens giving people cards charge they're authentic. something that. described article. 

“The data strongly suggestive people got vaccinated early Israel — is, January — seeing infections vaccinated higher rate people got vaccinated April,” said Dr. Sankar Swaminathan, chief infectious diseases division University Utah Health.  numbers *very* preliminary, preference might even justified. Yeah, exactly…… Maybe Everywhere USA... countries still can't get proper supply...
Gday New Zealand vaccination rate worse many poor countries. half El Salvador done example.

Blaming rich countries (New Zealand included group) accurate.  ever said Delta came America? Moderna shown 75% effectiveness preventing infection Delta variant....it ""break problem"" delta came irrelevant, whether patient 0 US ends making patient 100,000. would've much harder majority US citizens vaccinated. Again, thus reason states higher vaccination rates experiencing less spread.

The proof pudding 🍮 understand CA population FL population? Total cases?? realize even everyone FL died Covid, CA lose exact amount people still people alive, right?

Even higher population, CA's 14 day new cases 164k less FL's 286k. take account total population, CA 416 cases/100k FL 1334 cases/100k. even look links?

If looking 14-day trend new cases, realize CA starts 1 cases, that's change +100%. Then, FL starts 100 cases, that's change +50%. say CA worse CA's percentage change bigger? Even though CA added 1 new case FL added 50 new cases? I’m curious well. also want know delta deadly not. Half stuff I’ve read said it’s deadly half says it’s contagious causes deaths. stupid thing say. Even like comment way even attempt summarize personality based one comment made Reddit profile. 

It opinion. Saying fact make fact. Pretty egotistical think yout method communication BEST. Far stupid: example cause potential harm person does, potentially let buyer event happens infected. No, it’s really not. You’re assuming one infected case. Statistically speaking unvaccinated people either failed test, faked test somehow, become sick enough taking test event would longer test negative. You’ll also percentage vaccinated population carriers despite vaccinated. reasonable way protect whole room ensure everyone vaccinated, thereby minimizing spread minimizing sick get catch it. End story. 7-day average new deaths stands 21.

Isn't newspaper broke story last week Florida's death reporting reports 357 deaths today, 136.6 seven day moving average. correct. accidently read line California's. see worldometers could reporting number one ""tracking"". one numbers ""made up"" confident others? Population 11 million yea still good, similar Georgia’s winter outbreak averaging middle 9,000. I've low key worried last 18 months, 14 days 2nd dose I'll definitely let loose treat caring much. 

I see reason get life, around vulnerable people might want careful couple days courtesy (give symptoms time show up, although testing would better that's lot work might easily available). I'm 6 months vaccination. Glad hear boosters. mother's got immune disorder got 3rd jab. last February. Russia, hand, made much noise vaccinating… they’ve done next nothing

Well, successfully screwed vaccination campaign number countries failing deliver second dose vaccine. know, could used money improve ventilation built outdoor covered play/eating areas actually protected kids.

Instead he’s this. Gold silver teeth I'm sure squeeze oil human... America highest obesity rates world.. Even hospitalizations think we're gonna miss lot states are....similarly struggling. 

We're going start see major collapse things change....and we'll honestly looking like will. bet fun parties. really need tactful people. It, broad scope, black white, get fucking vax. individual scope, grey easily scare people. Changing opinions requires work callous demonstrative others make want anymore before. opinion, fact. add response thread: analysis link posted u/GracchiBros pretty excellent. Though ideally would 100% identical control group unvax people, comparing rates per 100k stratifying age good quick dirty first pass. also think analysis well-presented, intuitive, instructive.

The tougher stuff think other, harder measure confounders: vaxxed 40somethings look unvaxxed 40somethings? missing confounders...maybe people pre existing conditions likely vaxx caution? Maybe unhealthy people actually less likely get vaxxed since less health conscious general? Maybe, Dvir Aran pointed Twitter, Delta vaxxed folks Israel faster live areas exposed international travel? Maybe vaxxed people less cautious since feel protected? cautious cautious types general?

This want see report 55% number :/  Depends. caches oil rare-earth minerals? Also longer term treatments way hopefully assist. let virus decide timeline, pandemic never end. Solves problem we’re likely face lot conflicting emotions grieve that, hopefully get professional therapy guide through.  come contact infected person

This risk already mitigated requiring negative test proof vaccination. infected people event would be: people false negative test vaccinated people carrying virus. circumstances rare. Run lives can't imagine roll-out problem Cuba. I'd assume production real bottle-neck. Oh, that’s *good*. Sarcasm comedy. large majority raider fans know cholos. others mouthbreathers. NYT cannot source data point reported. refrain publishing incomplete information time verify receive additional information. It’s literally job this. That's thought hippocratic oath geared towards emergency think would weren’t tests lot places hear whining  least talk eating onion sandwich, like gonna sense smell...  No. not. Try learn read table.

California deaths per 1m 1,638

Florida deaths per 1m 1,915

As far active cases, literally nothing tracking it’s made stat would completely inaccurate anyways Florida weeks 10k plus days California crossed 10k mark days past six weeks.

Your denial isn’t working great, I’m sure it’s bolstered inability read simple table. what? give entirely? update recommendations status situation. football team run play every down, adapt. end game people need get vaccinated people clearly aren't, full FDA approval happens children 12 get vaccinated, going battling mutations trying reduce hospitalizations.  miss museums!

Imagine many asymptomatic kids schools right now.....  know, friend! explaining anything ^_^ Got J&amp;J April well. Feel better soon! Clearly you’re one.

There lots people anti vaccine / covid deniers / lockdowns, people hunker week. Darwinism. people don’t practice self preservation aren’t good it. It’s new stress system, many failed.

Everyone fighting half population consuming media that's telling experts ignored/defied. people unified conditions? (in US) supposed come together common good hyper individualism heavily promoted decades? hard expect people something common good people repeatedly told every person themselves. understand *why* hospitals short-staffed?  first twelve months pandemic, average *ten* healthcare workers died **every day**. There's estimate every death, ten long-haulers may problems working full shift - all. Older nurses pre-existing conditions want covid either retired moved non-patient-facing positions.

The people left burnt out, they're put mill **again** people community vaccinate. stay *literally* early grave community clearly care them. leave community, become travel nurse, make ten thousand dollars every week, *and* get best shifts. surprise number nurses actually stayed there. Shit bro got mine around then. Wish we’d get news need boosters soon Nah, vaccine 90-ish% effective, we'd see 15 million people breakthrough infections. faces sentence 10 years prison 12 counts him

Wow. smart move.  r/byebyejob  get threads get locked due 'politics'. entire sub basically r politics 2.0 look front page it. That's simplistic wrong. New variants created always, matters one becomes dominant dangerous is. depends selective pressure. Vaccines put significant selective pressure virus mutate strain resistant especially significant percentage 40%) still unvaccinated. That's critical keep lockdowns restrictions place vaccination critical percentage.  There's bit CO2 air days, sayin'. manufacturers updated vaccines pipeline, even Curevac. current booster shots vaccine foreseeable future. guess, I'm sure matters. Obviously actually expect need vaccination every month something. hyperbolic, thought pretty obvious.   Florida terrible place live lots reasons: heat, humidity, crocodiles, hurricanes, guns everywhere, half drivers 80 many Floridians. Lol yeah pretty much sums I'm pretty sure barely better field tents. building ICU-level care across country quickly. Also, limitation going qualified staff space. need rooms beds. need staff equipment.

Hospitals everywhere, assume Texas included, figured creative ways surge ICU capacity. detailed conversation system work multiple things expand capacity. Yeah, learned last months friends antivaxers antimask... trying talk sense walked away, they're fanatical beliefs. mean there’s difference getting accidentally hurt work vs told vaccination required keep working knowingly comply. compliance pretty much clears supposed liability, Slutbuster. That’s thought, too, I’m doc, so….🤷🏻‍♀️ easy(er). spontaneous. problem can’t battle mutations mutations countries unless wanna restrict travel several countries gonna waiting years everyone get vaccinated. personally think 12 approved would good timeline. \*surprised Pikachu face\*

They distrust source, twist facts information fit narrative, often contradict bullshit spew. according mechanic watched YouTube video exactly “COVID brain fog?” Like trouble remembering things short term / long term? aren’t making active cases, it’s data receive, it’s definition varies state it’s something that’s actually based case resolved not.

Just look Florida vs CA data, FL going gangbusters cases past 7 weeks, ton cases without resolution, CA fairly quiet. Yet active cases don’t relate reality all.

Plus cross reference cases deaths state FL state CA see numbers match fine.

So yes, Florida inaction caused cases death per capita CA, whole lot, gap deaths sadly continue grow cases resolve Florida, especially since long since blown past hospitals cope using best practices staffing ratios care.

In CA aren’t vaccinating, masking up, distancing, taking care themselves, FL Texas said they’d do.

I wonder, would breakthrough cases Delta variant tantamount ""booster"" shot? received full vaccination, catch Covid, would stand reason solid ground, least Delta variant. see, that’s hospital’s problem, mine.

/s makes sense vaccine supplies would go places greater need right eli5 considerable number people get COVID-19 even realize it, there's almost guarantee life-threatening fatal case go hospital reported statistics, survival rate COVID-19 higher 99% (but exact rate unknown)? No, signed pre purchase agreements. 

We haven’t shipped others, neither approved use.

We priority either companies ($ $$) world get coming from, reality lot stuff people come preventable. Yeah, exercising/eating right/wearing sun screen getting vaccine, think really want start drawing lines. means around 75% protection hospitalization, means 4 unvaccinated people would hospitalized, instead 1 vaccinated person would be.

That's great reason get vaccinated, still feel super-protective, imo. wonder death. wish employer thought way then. They're making come since symptoms. Got near 100% buy last time hopefully Here's sobering truth live data Northside? 691 beds, ER ICU diversion (not accepting ambulances). Piedmont, 643 beds, diversion. Emory, 751 beds, ER ICU diversion. Every hospital Fulton county (pop 1 million) *not* accepting ambulance right except children's hospital. sure area, comfort older vaccinated want enjoy meal. classic [crash low chance kinda offset around thousands people. mask mainly help people may unknowingly spreading (among things). know infected stay away man.

That ratio needs decline declare pandemic over.  wait them. areas special bed delay crews relieve ambulances watch patients special bed delay gurneys. Oh no, can’t potentially bring deadly virus country little hospital capacity! I’m sad you.

The cooks strategy/border policy despite part Realm NZ, kiwis aren’t even allowed till recently  I'm starting lose hope. I've hearing ""we're gonna peak soon"" weeks cases still going up. really feel like there's light end tunnel. felt hopeless since last year. Vaccinations going seem like that's effect anymore. feels like nothing we're working.  I'm sure else post this, element reporting breakthrough cases COVID driving nuts misleading statement is.  
 
""Breakthrough infections vaccinated people accounted 20% newly diagnosed cases."" 
 
Most people read think: ""Holy shit, even I'm vaccinated, 20% chance getting COVID! 1 every 5 COVID cases someone vaccinated!"" 
 
No!  
 
Imagine two states, let's call Fullvaxifornia Halfvaxifornia. population 100 people.   
 
In Vaxifornia, everyone vaccinated. Unfortunately, past year, 5 infections. since everyone vaccinated, infections breakthrough infections.  
 
In Novaxifornia, 50 people vaccinated; 50 not. Unfortunately, past year, 30 infections. 3 among vaccinated people, 27 among unvaccinated. 
 
Now, data, obvious vaccine works very, well -- 5 people infected place everyone vaccinated, 30 infections place half vaccinated. 
 
But let's say reported places using wording NYTimes article: 
 
""In Vaxifornia, breakthrough infections vaccinated people accounted 100% newly diagnosed cases."" 
 
""In Novaxifornia, breakthrough infections accounted 10% newly diagnosed cases."" 
 
As see, % breakthrough infections newly diagnosed cases completely meaningless statistic know % population vaccinated first place! 
 
So reported instead? 
 
Instead, report raw ratios comparison e.g. ""During COVID alpha, 1 100 vaccinated people got COVID, 30 100 unvaccinated people got COVID. COVID Delta, 10 100 vaccinated people got COVID, 50 100 unvaccinated people got COVID."" Reporting way would simultaneously show vaccine less effective Delta ALSO showing still extremely protective relative getting vaccinated all.  
  breastfeeding mom, side effect relief knowing might pass antibodies baby! we're seeing Kansas well. Hospitalizations 10%. Low spreading isn’t spreading. smart. Israeli data efficacy hospitalizations goes time, people get second dose earlier UK, data conflict UK data. Anyone says me, say go get vaccine white neighborhood. Think anyone trying poison *them*? think that’s really harsh assessment – accounts – groundbreaking work. Also, who’s* already started August Fellow Knoxvillian here. work service industry downtown firsthand say it’s absolute fucking nightmare. I’d shocked 5% people wearing masks here. Nobody gave shit really really don’t give shit now. Would nice vaccines distributed fairly, aren’t . wealthier countries got first. Also NZ isn’t priority, haven’t COVID ages. 

We’re using best vaccine, supporting pacific neighbours get theirs.

It’s called team player. rest world similar attitude maybe we’d kicked thing ago I’m reading documentation correctly, model takes account positivity rates, least somewhat help unknowns testing capacity. \-someone whose done nothing benefit humanity flush shits toilet Ironically, I'm thinking moving New England living Florida 50+ years. it. Sounds like they'll fit right in. sounds like I'll fit right there. That’s probably everyone already Covid   also physical disability (injury requires wheelchair use permanently) higher risk Hundreds hundreds thousands attendees negligible. *really* need get idea place US zero COVID. Thank much this! get damn vaccine poor guy movie theater check got negative test also when. Also, stop adding additional stress already overburdened medical system get vaccine instead working lab techs nurses every 3 days. chance spreading low mask up? fast. --Texas Gov.

also important note vaccinated population skews lot older vulnerable. Around 80% 65 older fully vaccinated. lot lower younger groups. vaccines effect, one would expect population make vast majority cases. metric underestimate vaccine effectiveness, vaccination rate climbs. Yeah that’s another thing consider. Staffing is, cases, even bigger problem. I'm sympathetic...to health care workers working asses take care idiots. taking abuse many along way. brother one working ICU. next asshole says ""the hospitals empty"" going get earful. Get available, would welcome join team moderna. cool kids. 40% adults one? kinda thinking too. Third time around body might like ""oh thing again"" lol Uhhhh no, you’re sick. Stay home don’t spread people. Hopefully there’s room governor thanks! long experiencing symptoms for? scared children right now. Long covid thing. appear significantly affect children. 

How effective would double masking school? mean eat, maskless safe child individually safer? guide parents kids? moat part, we’ve known kids play part super spreading almost year. it’s interesting masks aren’t mandatory. went looking day. really, really hard find proper breakdown better subgroup 0-17. best could find CDC's data, Even write no, make sure least vote one democrats running case gets recalled. polio kill like 5-10% people though?

And I'd like think reporting polio, despite times, would quite accurate given symptoms. severity symptoms increase, likelihood person seek medical treatment grows.

Which means people freak fuck think they're slowly becoming paralyzed versus cold symptoms. Nobody could predicted this!! Please quit saying latter part lot ICU many died. sure would call 'problem'. fully vaccinated 1/1, person would get first dose 5-6 weeks (so, mid-November), nobody trial participants able get vaccines. Thank you. I’m still processing it. It’s bizarre.   confusing two things.  Yes, schedule test right walk get vaccinated immediately. point that's like car-free days avoid drink driving accidents. punish vaccinated? Shit get really, really bad South. Lollapalooza viewed vaccine success story is. Hundreds thousands attendees couple hundred linked Covid cases. That's good, math.  whole household goes check ups year, big deal. It’ll likely end yearly shot, like flu shot. Maybe even given time. People survive months slightly lower immunity, especially it’s timed summer. ""following science"" not?

That train left station long ago.  don’t. pointless since they’re pretty much radicalized. thing possibly chance changing minds personally affects loss even that’s long shot. It’s exhausting trying convince people mask up.  read TLDR thread: Ok makes sense disruption deliveries global situation NZ response.

What kinds disruptions. live we're back normal terms deliveries (been while). sure global thing? No, also would prefer lose best paying job I've  That's beginning. they're arguing masks, soon enough they'll saying need restrictions last waves, including curfews stay-at-home orders. 

Personnaly really mind masking public places. aside + distancing, want restrictions. end point, can't live society without social contacts forever. least, can't. *a lot* retail pharmacists, call bottom barrel implies lot barrel classified bottom. think industry pretty clearly tops PharmD’s Kay Ivey issued state emergency specifically said mask mandates lockdowns would happen. Alabama, wealthy get medical care, plebs die. They're saying covid leave expired June 31 though. call employer can't make anything. slave? cousin’s wife struggled weaned off. slowed weaning process eventually able come off.  going around lot people, close rides lines, high.  I'll honest, know stats, surely can't 40%? could look countries data. humans well, governments better Meanwhile ministers like refuse call vaccinations concerns turning away congregations. pharmacies throwing vaccines also completely take home tests. People going like covid thing meanwhile weekly meeting hospital staff keeps talking dire situation is.

As usual, source: Meanwhile, US, half populace willfully spreading around like wildfire ability contract trace whatsoever. Hats NZ. worry now. make new one. worries.  tested positive they’re trying make come in, CALL HEALTH DEPARTMENT. Polio thing nobody says Polio serious. fair, he’s always hated teachers. 8 months booster another one perhaps? one see issue this? take account, still ""ultra rare"". perfectly straight you. Covid traumatic people. Even people want admit it, severe impacts peoples' mental health. Like trauma face, really need take things slow one step time recover. small win still win nothing ashamed of, rather encouraged. Consider finding small group people doing/dealing same, communicate (even remote now).

Thankfully situation seem delaying dad's cancer treatment much think well…. lol obvious anyone reading UK data months, everyone be, fantastic data, unlike usa.

The bleating 99 percent utter bullshit propoganda. ""exceedingly rare"" even ""rare"" description.

The vaccines effective. fantastic there's need misrepresent effectiveness. also dangerous. old, better still quite careful, vaccinated person 50 second risk group, way behind dancing death, unvaccinated 50s. young give shit people, vaccinated wear mask indoors spread rife (like right now, everywhere USA). still marathon going on?  Nice going, Pineys. still lot unknowns here…but almost 0.2% US died covid far, would hard know true survival rate many don’t get diagnosed. Even survival rate higher think still ability fill ICUs effectively left unchecked. I’m sorry hear that. Get better soon! real efficacy immunity going &lt;50% 8 months in. Basically ~~lied to~~ lead believe inaccurate information Pharma govt. could easily gotten asymptomatic. chosen tell you. idea statement true not. Yes. Grand experiment, indeed. son turned four wonder he’s older read time history.

I keep journal write life time. post grand experiment truly resonates feel need make sure write happening , rewritten foretelling future.   FWIW drank heavily day got vaccine felt nothing besides standard hangover next day Lol

Yeah

I problems entire life turns I'm rare mutant. Lotta fun. worst part simultaneously look act pretty normal, don't.  Wtf Axices (is word?) neck-beard uncle gets information Fox News I’ve always believed number undetected cases vastly overestimated throughout thing number actual detected cases lot closer would want admit. Otherwise susceptible hosts point? 

The idea “we’ve already asymptomatic” common talking point anti-restrictions folks throughout first half pandemic. don’t clog ER let God miracles. OK getting quickly approved booster shots every 8 months manufacturers recommending (at least now)?  
Personally see reasonable solution. Oh sorry, ship US Flag it, Confederate Flag. you. Go ask Sons Confederate Veterans, Johnny Reb. Naw. Louisiana. definitely going hospital. I'm guessing going come thunderous end point.

If government honest upfront people, ample supply vaccines populace, certain point message needs ""delta contagious contain long term, going run course, please protect get vaccine, &lt;X anymore shutdowns"". 

The real issue story pandemic utterly failed communication coming countries. US specifically, antivax morons aside, CDC completely failed clearly communicating things public. CDC early decided going try control public narrative, repeatedly shot foot since. really needed upfront public, communicate facts, omit lie things try direct public discourse. 

Between Trump's admin failed communications CDC take decades rebuild reputation had.  absurd Black Americans damaging get vaccine rich white Americans gotten ASAP. deaths period 50+ people elderly comorbidities. I’m waiting data long covid, brain fog clotting vaccinated people. prevents reliably real world scenarios we’re good. Otherwise remains risk I’m going feel comfortable going back normal. far it’s looking really good still bit risky we’ll see happens boosters. vaccinated 🍁🏒, I’m indifferent. They’re legit startin’ get tits.   Yeah, still fatigue many days after. Luckily, extra sleepy weekend. (My work scheduled 2nd dose Friday) Lol thanks! nickname high school since bearded, man child looking one time read it. 

It is, really know getting downvoted either lol idk look anything America go, yeah money matter.  China, Russia, Mexico, Indonesia, Ecuador, Brazil, Peru, Iran, Turkey, etc etc etc China exist already, CCP hired 1.4 billion actors /s half schools open 2 weeks open full week. I'm going go social media enabled poor ideas spread far wide.

-as type social media platform.   wide barrel don’t think get full thoughts &amp; prayers combo you’re infected. pandemic people looking right now, 1918 don’t think skin color much it, there’s lot dumb people America.   keep hospitals overwhelmed short term. different now. 

please see texas, alabama, kentucky, tennessee, mississippi, florida..... say member Manila? 

Maybe missed run next election. jump closing would logical say mandate seat belts make safer, require certain level competency, restrict certain people driving (drunks, tired, underage, etc)?

oh yeah, never understood “I’ve got immune system/natural immunity” arguments.

The virus novel. 

And separately, many colds life time? dominant strain turning every often, sure, may see immune system recognition … also might not.

To many people confident immune system figure bizarre.  break leg. Unvaxxed not- going get punished, don’t room  would mutate able propagate unvaccinated person? imagine would like vaccine? i'm confused. states treating covid ""just flu"" right seeing 10-30x many deaths flu per day  moment, looks like Pfizer vaccine first shot available children 12. vaccine maker expects enough data end September support emergency use authorization vaccine children 6 years old ""We're hoping authorization — depending results and, course, decisions — long school year starts,"" Dr. Phil Dormitzer, Chief Scientific Officer Viral Vaccines Pfizer, told NPR data children 6 submitted shortly thereafter, Pfizer spokesperson told NPR.

Ugh, school year would much better. It’s costly delay terms infections. think poor countries lack resources, sure poorest turned away hospital die home, street.😔 hot career field go 20 years ago. see articles hottest career fields go invariably pharmacist near top list. course, letting tourists next year would disastrous. everyone vaccinated, countries like NZ benefit waiting.  pretty good motivator…

i doubt that's real motivation right since nurses walk medical clinic get job. means likely stuff said mattered.

i think daily testing required would see change, nasal test, full brain tickling test aka new normal Elderly people tend vaccinated lot cases young people children can't vaccinated yet.

So possible lot cases among unvaccinated people still see amount deaths before. masks losing battle. every flight Ive taken, everyone takes mask time eat peanuts get passed out. 

It's like mask mandate restaurants here. wear entered, left, got go bathroom, entire time seated table even eating masks could off. People lose faith policies make logical sense. can: Vaccines chose mutate; completely random. unvaccinated person much, much higher viral load, there's billions chances virus randomly mutate. They'll also virus much longer. vast majority mutations affective Delta naturally disappear, one might better.

Vaccinated people's immune systems immediately target virus, there's much less opportunity mutate. Oh pissed. told quite frankly, couldn’t legally sign chronic condition morbid obesity, she’d either need new condition pop become religious get letter signed church/mosque leader. Glad would’ve felt slimy sign that. know quit got COVID…still alive.

That’s really metric, though. care unvaccinated people getting disease. made choice. long vaccinated people fine, care spread among unvaccinated. children seem safe delta. seems idiot ""sovereign citizen"" persuasion responses court jurisdiction ""living man"" entered contract requiring wear mask.

I doubt he'll successful line defense. Please explain im wrong, can. go far... Yes, vaccinated people infected, *immediately* antibodies *immediately* recognise neutralize virus, cells maintain homeostasis immunoregulation repeat chronically encountered antigens, killer cells *immediately* seek destroy cells infected virus, helper cells *immediately* stimulate production antibodies killer cells. worry natural selection real covid decide. We’re unlikely get nearly high.

/s also won’t let schools send home/quarantine covid + kids either. literally hates kids. dumb ass yes. want dying covid matter cost %. think cases directly delivered covax. Peer review important I'm saying anything wrong analysis. problem news pieces people reddit interpreting single result causal generalizable. There's probably element random variability (it's large data set overall number breakthroughs big), cohorts may exactly matched (they match individual characteristics person's, different areas gave different vaccines, exposures different).. Pfizer constantly waning Moderna followup period, I'd confidence result. exactly three months, Pfizer bit better one month, Pfizer going bunch July, I'd cautious result. 

Never read much one data set, peer reviewed not.

Just clear, think efficacy vaccines waning, I'm ready declare difference them. Lets put dress code school. Let see get dress codes banned.   Plus millions upper middle class white folk rushed inject mRNA COVID vaccines ASAP. 100% understand distrust, think see rich white people climbing get it............ Cope Molecular biologist here. 

COVID19 antibodies ""attracted"" binding sites spike protein like magnets. antibody passing spike protein pulled trajectory attach it. antibody happens floating toward protein runs it, bind it. they're like sticky notes magnets. 

Wouldn't drug like DRACO effective within certain window infection, small number cells infected, cells undergo apoptosis (the technical term cell self-destructing) majority cells (uninfected) left alone. infection progresses large number infected cells? Would DRACO induce cell death massive scale destroys tissue?

The original paper even mentions this:

Perhaps caveat DRACOs never funded widely used.  level basically ""facebook friend"" someone really hates kids, REALLY hate kids. economic harm country covid will.

Hmm expect isnt case it? I’d rather gotten gotten booster vaccine dose. Quarantining sucks.  Looks like can, lockdown, ring fence, isolate close contacts, get back living virus free another 10 months. Lol. Dont talk things idea about. hope wave soon. think take much longer.... everyone else? Let suffer. We’re done.

I say unironically: live society. sympathy unvaccinated people either, reality vaccinated people also affected covid straining healthcare system. fully vaccinated people places like Florida Texas right procedures delayed wait 24+ hours get bed ER. There's also fact outbreak school force schools shift online even child fully vaccinated. care probably affect way, like not. kid, find many vaccines require 3 doses. know, get flu shot. Yeah idea talking about. pretty clear november elections LAST YEAR vote Labour would vote lockdowns.

And oh would look Labour got 50% vote 13% last election, greens got 8 % vote. almost 60% population okay lockdowns. Here's awful thought: God side? Like months bodies piled high books burned, rapture happens god comes like: ""I told demonrats liberals wuz gonna kick ass!""

What universe void even remotest justice? Well everyone kind *done* pandemic. Plus lot people seem believe surge last much longer. early days, yes. Now? Hell people dumb hell. dumb people manipulated doing. Quit demonizing morons. literally can’t help it. misinformation regurgitated people intentionally taking advantage them. yes, every person comes around victory benefits us I’ll celebrate it. Many people never never admit wrong. may dumb, least aren’t prideful eventually right thing. certainly aren’t awful human beings. Feels like World War Z sadly. makes sense. vaccines fucking work. low case numbers (20ish day) incredible, contact tracing team total 7 cases now. new 6 young people active social lives. scares bit might gone rampant young peoples nightlife, schools, jobs, curing “hangovers” one older man got sick got tested. already hospital high school full investigation, we’re 24 hours in. Even wanted uncompassionate, would terrible idea point. believe region peaked yet, every person needing ICU treatment need due COVID. would nice isolated hospital receive people hospitals become COVID wards. healthy student taken doses vaccines, limited risk regardless college does. really, I'm happy relative normalcy last 10 months, lockdown 3 weeks prevents 1000's people dieing ability go back living life normally it. Prolonging pandemic? lol what? pandemic bud, nip bud. basically suffer milder milder waves, basically like flu. kill you, get symptoms, go doctor, give something like tamaflu, get better.

This one last big waves, we've gotten mortality rate order magnitude. looking good. I’ve looking haven’t found anything useful. daughter (22) caught covid May 2020 got second dose last June past weekend fever wasn’t feeling well took home test positive covid today got results long test positive. first two days symptoms first time, fever, chills, night sweats general fatigue feeling achy feeling better today didn’t last long first bout. health conditions fit also fell little behind getting second dose don’t know could consequences. difficult say sure w/o knowing demographics. Older folks vaccinated first likely less immune response. 
 
I disagree w/ idea expediting boosters, think 24 239 hospital full vaccinated (necessarily) concerning (w/o age info). know mystery right word. pick virus key much anywhere.  Seems pretty soft. Thai Airways flight day didn’t fuck about. Basically said “If break rules prosecuted Thai law go jail”. Would love see antimaskers Bangkok Hilton fortunately everyone complied lol.  Even now, many vaccine mandates going around, vaccinating many people. guess anti-vaxxers truly deluded they're willing anything, even make lives hell get shot. No. Floridian financially stuck really really trying get out, please :(   Yeah swear majority Reddit bucket time too. got many pointless arguments. look now, people dead attitude. IMO blood hands spreading shit. perfect storm stupidity selfishness. Add American ranks Think it, boosters approved use 8 months second shots, they’ll spaced out. suspect they’ll also clarify healthcare workers seniors go first—which, they’ll reach 8 month mark general public anyway. 

We surplus shots now, think supply might get somewhat squeezed, I’m expecting quite bad time around.   Let’s hope teacher union stands behind her. feel teachers, they’re walked undervalued. Parents complain supply list teachers require class teachers end pay pocket things. schools got shutdown teachers figure teach virtually zero guidance parents throats. It’s sad little teachers respected. must kids let Bugs Bunny saw Florida.   sure. second concept though. State Lemp first, really excellent. Built success launch Kin. Great people. Sorry, matter see reddit popularity still high. Paradoxically latest outbreak may increase that, best crisis. One worrying factors states next other. one state’s ICU fills often times airlift people next state you’re Alabama need medical attention ICU full Georgia, Florida, Mississippi you’re pretty SOL. Perhaps Tennessee may extra room they’re going able accommodate overflow crowd Georgia, Alabama Mississippi long. 1800 dollars children's safety? hope schools laugh state exactly like that. Somehow asthmatic toddler zero problem breathing mask. can't breathe mask, wearing wrong. makes sense. hospital last August (non-covid related) actually separate buildings covid non-covid. Unfortunately, needed ICU room ended side makeshift ICU. huge room curtains separating us. Im probably repeating replies said we've trying inform half year? (likely people anti-mask that's easily year) 

Personally I've come accept far gone. death wish, whatever. hard care listen. Well, point wearing masks stopping unnecessary spread virus, particularly large portions society still unvaccinated.

The spread dangerous direct symptoms (which may still send vaccinated people hospitals) potential mutations may emerge process. virus circulates, changes potent may become evading vaccine protection severe infection.

Wearing mask inconvenience hardly end world, it?

I've never understood hysteria anti-maskers. exactly problem imaginary belief government oppression, lol? Typically COVID patients go ""COVID unit"" things like negative pressure rooms. day zero ICU COVID beds available, might still non-covid beds. some, difficult logistical puzzle. long want wear masks for? endemic. Get everyone vaccinated move lives. government incompetent  change goal then. people 12 get vaccine, winter come Lambda variant news “it evades vaccines! way protected get another dose vaccine evade!” don’t think makes difference. Singapore able procure vaccines quite early even significant covid outbreaks. 🇸🇬 track 80% population fully vaccinated.  worse could even guessed pessimist. guess good news Google tells 25,000 people live Winston County.

Still, that's pathetic.  Ok. misinformation? Quote Totally.

Luckily, presently luxury. last insurance plan, I'd come another $500 could seen new patient, seen issue, (there's $500) - labs again.

Until got better insurance, afford spend $1k duplication efforts.  isn’t right sub misinformation rude. bet others might fit better. :)  kids aren’t vaxxed

Edit: I’m idiot

Still, I’d wait see well vaccines hold delta. Initial results promising new data shows around 50% effective accurate ""covidestim"" website, cause seems like quite states/counties r0 transmission values go 1.0? live. even schedule COVID test.

Everyone booked due resurgence.  This. People getting really tired constant “wear mask” “don’t wear mask” told want see say covid control.

It didn’t help officials said don’t consider blm protests super spreaders say bike rally is. hold positions Pfizer, Moderna well others. Fear obviously drives profit 😉 ""Since proven airbags dramatically reduce chances death event car crash, let's end seatbelt oppression, shall we?""

Vaccinated people still carry significant virus load, even asymptomatic, children 12 cannot vaccinated. Good, I’m glad it’s finally talked about! thank sharing link, hadn’t seen it. don’t think even published made comments, (but paywalled article can’t see time lol), still stand comment MSM’s reporting. 1 article today saying “breakthroughs happening” get rid 5 million “breakthroughs DONT happen!” articles flooded recent weeks. 

And totally get states hold data yet, MSM going around past weeks saying breakthrough infections extremely rare gave people false sense confidence. reporting way were, IMO. acted 100% fact, reality wasn’t enough data say one way other. 

This whole pandemic biggest clusterfucked mishandling ever. vaccinated odds ventilator slim none. Mandate vaccine- mask. Get 100 opinions vaccines, they'll say thing

Thank - summed better did! likely take while, particularly classification constitutes PASC entirely arbitrary. Deaths quite binary nature ;) can't lip read everyone else around wearing mask. see know much hard hearing.

No, actually.

However hard sign, let alone read lips attached ventilator.  aren’t allowed this. Public universities answer state funds argument hospitals still crowded covid patients need restrictions, understand disagree keep people living lives. Unfortunately, though. That's infectious disease doc told me.

I went GP classic lyme symptoms - joint pain, severe swelling one leg, constantly tired, foggy recalled pulling deer ticks dog 10 weeks prior.

""Tell I'm idiot stay internet, think need lyme test. BTW - I've covid shots.""

Round antibiotics yay - swelling symptoms going fast! Yay!

Finished antibiotics - still feel crappy. huge swollen leg, drained. wiped heck out.

Also worth noting - dog developed symptoms within week me. Vet diagnosed lyme without even drawing blood based where/when hiking obvious symptoms brought in. Dog recovered round antibiotics, also seems easily exhausted weeks. He's much better now. 

""Well that's supposed happen"" - doc feeling worse again.

Queue next shit storm billing, testing, 'we idea, might cancer.  thnk lyme.'

So I'm trying get hotly contested ebate. 

My initial tick exposure 20 weeks ago. ID specialist's position thinks lyme least year ago, 'something else, idea what. Probably B, Maybe C D. could B. C (cancer).'

Thanks doc. That's really helpful.

My point doctors perfect geniuses.

I've learned symptoms point types cancer point symptoms become diagnostically useful. 

I'd like thank UK's NHS system determining things referred specialists wonderful troubleshooting guide. 

I recognize I'm barely educated moron. google terms diagnostic criteria reading advanced webMD fun. I'll going back doc another round 'I still feel like crap.' appreciate 'could cancer, nothing big enough look at.'

But believe tell I'm spending hundreds dollars pocket poked prodded psychosomatic problems.

I'd say we're long ways 'chronic lyme.' think we're still 'sucks 10 weeks treatment sucks taking full recovery.'

But dont' lot info that, either.  Trying avoid derailing thread quick peek /r/pharmacy give insight. loaded question let's say lowering wages, overabundance graduates, terrible job market, increasing expectations little increase pay, much more. Moronic. Shameful 20% vaccinated Wow, pretty close. conclusion drawn, sorry happened Daughter. :-( UK announced considering mixed shots fully vaxxed least entry purposes, might become problem given close ties Canada. 7 years call quits lol. work grocery chain much better still trying get foot door hospital even per diem  *sounds exponential increase intensify *

i don’t know everyone act like happened India can’t happen elsewhere can't lip read everyone else around wearing mask. see know much hard hearing. could theoretically buy rogue racist healthcare workers would something think would widespread foolish. curious, symptoms like? hope recover quickly! No, invade homes, destroy infrastructure, train children poor caretakers leave quickly disease move back quickly. Chicago back mask mandate. fucking outrageous. I'm goody two shoes covid compliant asshole there, fully vaccinated, I'm board. superior I'm sure bought stock Pfizer Moderna. Right?

If profits have.  tell turn tv?  deaf?

I see wearing mask applies deaf.... Plus actually good job tracking movements makes contact tracing far easier  Lol Booster Shots mean end mask mandates? got first two April sensory issues wearing mask. certain end care people like people asthma people struggle mask. “mass hospitalizations” I’m kinda tired getting subjective answers. It’s time put numbers things. Also hear “omg icu beds almost out!” icu beds usually capacity wise. mention hospitals usually overflow beds news “forgets” mention. February July Tuskegee study **DENYING** medical treatment people. fact people using deny medical treatment families absolutely mind blowing ugh. Bless heart dealing CVS. What's going death count Florida? dropped way cliff last week, there's way that's anywhere close accurate account. yesterday day before, 1900 children presently hospitalized Covid. sound like much, huge compared previous outbreaks. hard say right that's Delta worse children, many infected sliver require hospitalization make huge group. deaf?

Obviously anecdotal evidence Winston County, holy moly shockingly bad, ashamed. challenges popping up. hope it’s late kids. Polls showing Liberals leading, majority. personal prediction another Liberal minority. covid case explosions longer result mass hospitalizations. big thing 20% ""in agency able determine vaccine status."" 26,848 cases 14,262 status could determined. That's pretty huge gap.

No clue breakdown would be, **if** assume fully vaccinated people likely ""determined status,"" would cut percent rate vaccinated deaths way down.

Not saying unknowns vaccinated. idea. Maybe percentages exactly confirmed/not confirmed. think states main entry points US got hit early hard Covid-19 knew going might deaths early got head start death count speak.

Now compare number deaths states (NY, NJ, CA etc) per day *in present* versus FL, TX, TN etc get back us might noticed.  not, that's reality. think people still either naive denial hence massive freak outs breakthrough cases. Maybe 3 year old, 2 year old. None friends 2 year olds successful getting consistently wear mask. 75% 3 year olds know though.

It much, much easier getting wear diaper mask. order even attempt remove diaper, 2 year old would first need figure undo drawstring pants pull down. Removing mask simple grasp it. Jerry ""So what, genitals still lined up."" **Aug. 18, 00:00 (UTC+9)**

""Get yer fuckin jab, bud"" one case last night announced lockdown. found 6 cases morning experts estimate may actually 50 100 cases active community already. 

We lockdown one case, locked know came from, meaning could many cases. 

We zero natural immunity 18% vaccinated. lockdown would instant exponential growth. also 2nd lowest rate ICU beds OECD, ahead Mexico. hospitals would collapse quickly. 

Just look Sydney, took half measures couple weeks, tried lockdown. late, they're 8 weeks lockdown 633 new cases today numbers growing. That's avoided. 

And new cases found morning. One teacher largest school country. One nurse largest hospital. also spent weekend going church clubbing city centre. index case spent two evenings packed maskless pubs watching rugby. could many super-spreaders. lockdown stop it. That’s difference. difference getting test vs vaccine. lived last 18 months normally, safe go Hospital there. lack ICU beds, Hospital car parks filled temporary beds morgue trucks. hard fast lockdown sop even Delta strain, shown South Australia.  Telling anti vaxxers politely get bent. However keep least half states US population less 5 million states right limit travel within borders, seems matter motivation mindset.

Picture crazies ranting masks local city council meeting imagine they're charge running state. thinking prematurely lifted mask mandates months ago? see study confirm this.
In general, getting infected similar vaccinated. Additionally, severe infections lead better immunity. literally care die anymore. don’t care either.

Why everyone else? Let suffer. We’re done. parking lot you! (US question) think possibility boosters approved general pop, getting appointment becomes difficult again? supply kinks worked enough scale large amount American's try get booster?    indoctrination hell drug same.

life happens. People died contagious shit long we've existed. I've probably spread flu something someone died. oh well. life.

i genuinely care. still (it wont be) Delta wasn’t thing trials. always ton Florida people north east summer. Every Jew NY NJ moves Florida turn 60 comes back visit cold here. Lockdown couple days prevents mass outbreaks. Yeah, insanity.... means need use sick leave now, go in. Travel may way spread kick starts point driving compared rampant spread among local unvaccinated antimask anti measure population think worse states virtual/hybrid happen now. Otherwise it’ll result full shutdown maybe virtual classes. It’s pretty obvious result 100% capacity southern states. I’m #1 going day 3 worker. Everything setup virtual staff could keep working. allowing spread going make worse. I’m Louisiana, give 2 weeks most. Read article. Thalidomide experimentation PR? know that. never knew took place. Read article. asked data misleading. answered that. problem question answered. that? Good, let’s follow TSA FAA vaccine mandate US airports. may exposing lawsuits, owe duty care existing patients.

Read again. fires time pass ""abandonment"" threshold, owes care. Need tickets please guy kind weird trolly flak this? even better understand point, say typically never get super ill. need study childrens' vaccine finish. Latest timing heard December-ish. literally said ""thats great reason get vaccinated."" think said anything meaningful certainly answered question.

Quibbling dates hardly addresses point. Move goalposts 2/1 3/1 done go 1.3% 1.9% 2.3% cases. Maybe word ""uncommon"" different meaning from?  January spread rampant holidays. good move. Sounds like excuse call dumb antivaxxers tbh  Go pharmacy doesn’t file already. could go digging insurance, it’s pain ass do, say don’t it, won’t check. 

I don’t guarantee won’t come back bill later, it’ll work short term. does, play stupid pay $10 month it’s gone. wonder common? cruelty broken system places burden protecting communities individual (voluntary vaccination &amp; mask use, porous social safety net many people go back underpaid jobs put children risk daycare/school so, etc.) places innocents, like people’s kids, harm’s way. Thank information correction! 


Similarly, asking first foremost try well-informed, make sure logic sound. admit skeptical fear mongering media, much politics governing, overall handling reaction COVID19. first wanted know logic sound apolitical sense. easier drive fully function hospital coast assemble field hospital. bet field hospitals still list options things keep getting worse. No, what's issue? Uh, UK also used 12-week interval versus 3 Pfizer Israel US. Vaccine hesitancy understand degree, obsession letting schools mandate masks mindboggling. people choosing hill die on?  Except nowadays deliberate. *Dis*Information. Kentucky school boards don’t healthy relationship science. I'm semi watching sister law get point. Last heard get it. brother, oldest mom got vaccinated. son young forced 14 year old get yet. 

At point sympathy Something tells children. They've literally compliant zero issues wearing mask. Plenty people hi IQ (but low EQ, big ego, narcissistic, something else) anti. Boggles mind. Argentina mixing doses, Sputnik V recepients opt get second dose moderna astrazeneca. mainly getting moderna AZ still needed complete vaccinations recieved first dose Astrazeneca. Also, plant started producing Sputnik V country first batches approved Galameya, meaning could produce doses Sputnik V vaccine, dose 1 dose 2, independently Russia (they still need send vaccine components plant here). Comparing UKs decline US’s decline late Nov bit disingenuous. US witnessed slight decline UK saw cases plummet plateauing much lower level.

Cases slightly risen past weeks 25k 7 day average 29k seven day average today. That’s period 17 days. That’s exponential growth. It’s also important note cases dropped peak 7 day average 45k. Deaths reflect decline.

Of course, bang drums victory yet. virus shown diligent little batters, cold weather + kids going back school + UK open ever lead another stress test vaccines. 7 Florida (per Worldometer). Yeah, they're fudging data.   think would depressed looked newspaper pandemic saw ""funeral home hiring"" Good. Looks like someone thinking fuck guy always thought first young kids group 5-11, article says ""over 5"", 6-11.

Darn it. articles reading claiming 5-11, example, Pfizer running separate trials COVID-19 vaccine ages 5 11, ages 2 5, ages 6 months 2 years....  says anticipate sharing results seeking authorization vaccine ages 5 11 early September Hospitals still nowhere close run. peak November/December 2020, 2-3x many ICU 4x many people hospitalized without health care system run.

Minnesota 70% vaccinated among eligible population 55% vaccinated total population. vaccines work, deaths low high risk population mostly vaccinated something Minnesotans worried about. rest world betting countries can’t add drug companies profits. Also would assume side effects booster super minimal, people got asses kicked mrna vaxxed immune response. would assume boosters easy you.

Plus let's honest, mrna vaxx doses fucking tiny, compared flu vaxx barely noticed jab.  Despite surge new cases due Delta variant, hospitalizations deaths stayed relatively low, compared previous waves pandemic. always kind thought like decided start wearing clothes thousands years ago. know always guys dicks saying ""I need wear pants."" used wonder death toll Spanish flu usually reported ""50 100 million"". That's big margin error one hundred years ago. understand, even today's technology, looks like we'll never know total death toll pandemic confidence. That's basically proportion cases population Portugal, mask mandates everywhere, even street. there's that... Wonder else wrong regards vaccines. know - lived Japan get test.

Even student mine tested positive, test me. press Japan ""free"" lot saving face shame get COVID.

These things combined make think significant undercount.   Florida mess. Governor ignored health experts. first, take COVID pandemic seriously. foolishly interfered local governments businsses wanted impose mask mandates. encourage vaccination enough.  result: thousands people unnecessarily getting sick dieing. Whatever happened right life? incubation period 5 days, didn’t catch school. Though, that’s coming I’m sure.  Williamson warned state’s 23% positive test rate... ABC News. also ""opinion,"" reporting incident actually occurred. thought too! I’ve hoping 5 yo would part first group eligible 12 younger. Hopefully it’s typo? still testing much all. 

They (were?) pursuing cluster busting strategy backwards contact tracing find spreader events, testing looks underutilized, strategy may able keep Delta.

In case, everyone needs look excess deaths. case, undercount seem super high. tough year. 

Well god damned hard year. Jesus Christ. simple equation solve.  ..I think that's works. transmits vaccinated people too. getting stronger stronger flu strains even flu shot?  could happened?! Simple loophole: run office win. Apparently whatever want. Require masks school dress code, that's loophole work. Texas it. people insane. Schools supposed safe place place panic distress making people sick endangering them.  terrible headline. Deaths always highest Tuesday due lag weekend. highest number deaths we've single day wave 100.

Also, deaths people caught Covid daily cases around 45000. likely peak deaths wave. January wave bit higher cases peak 1000 daily deaths. vaccines pretty much reduced deaths factor 10. Sensible answers pertinent questions. well written article lays evidence support conclusions. waited see safe. happened entire time age group allowed to. time eligible science spoke itself. Millions vaccinated one major reactions worth concern (statistically speaking) got asap could. I'm really sure compare numbers (US verses India) since testing feasible US. Scott Gottleib said couple weeks ago likely daily case count around 1 million US, around 100,000 getting testing. first line article says need know plan. 

I mean get wife’s doctor still. $3.5 billion isn’t enough Pfizer?

My family got three J&amp;J. wife little four days real problems. previously perfectly healthy 30 year old adult son passed twice store immediately getting shot still, months later, struggling panic attacks. He’s learned stop start odds still scared struggling. 

There booster family. stay home. Well, \*some\* are. significant number privileged elite, like DeSantis, hopped crazy train train dark tunnel 90. bought ticket, past end station, can't hop off. Surgery

It's Trailer Park Boys thing. Ricky says. participate school board meetings?  perfectly fine reason, imo, agree. goes show demented someone be, low one go justify getting vaccine mah freedoms. Equally terrifying ""I've done little research own"" mean, reports videos 
until implemented hard lock downs. absolutely way 3,000 died initial phase. So, yeah. China definitely cooked books, least early months. Better thousands dying covid fucking economy. Yeah really weird definition tyranny turns out. Basically ""whenever get way, government overreach subjugation"". Fucking toddlers. Imagine someone told April 2020 August 2021, would still back normal anytime soon. Thanks asking! Yes everyone seems ok, nobody showing signs long covid far good God says good 👍   worse headline Republican created $163 million school grant program 
 using federal virus relief funds controls, schools  
mask mandates close COVID-19 outbreaks won’t  
eligible additional $1,800 per student. 

So block school accessing funds mask mandate, blocks school accessing funds shutdown due outbreak.

Essentially governor incentivizing schools help spread virus, also let continue spread like wildfire starts school.

This hyperbole; man allowed remain office. vote internet push label new variant Florida.... Desantis.  [This official statement Paris three ISDs county, second largest Lamar, daughter attends. Knowing tend follow other’s guidelines assist other, would surprised see three thing. 

On flip side, I’m already hearing pissing moaning parents. entertaining week two.  North East, lead semi-normal life. Dining bars enforce vaccinations (in NYC least), OK putting mask grocery store. another 5 years, anti-vaxxers, die off. America.  really interested learn governors perceived year now...I doubt good. information shows Louisiana worst seven-day COVID-19 death rate **six deaths per 100,000 residents**, followed Arkansas (5.5 deaths per capita); Nevada (4.3 deaths per capita); Missouri (3.3 deaths per capita).

Yes, it’s extremely bad writing, edit part answered question? It’s incredible board education wouldn’t consider science behind masks voicing opposition mask mandate.  hell? ok? governor announced Tuesday 3,276 new cases state, one-quarter children 18 under.  That's exactly what's happening, so.... chance ruled unconstitutional? wonder causes problems helps since people get arguments masks wearing masks. people wearing high quality masks flights (I think couple European airlines banned cloth masks). crazy fixing travel ban craziness. seems window dressing move actually help. 

People high risk traveling wearing high quality masks fitted properly. Please get vaccine soon. Worry first get it, parents get too. convince later on, that's great. However, parents responsible adults know responsible lives. Feeling much way south border.  stories need told, people need hear them. hear many, many stories, *may* reconsider.

In meantime, also need make sure people reasonable access (transportation, work schedules, etc. - excuses). Community leaders need perform outreach. need establish vaccine mandates workplaces funplaces.  ""Hey, chance punish liberal school districts! Sure, eventually get shot courts maybe get hurt liberal kids along way.""

November decline cases never made appreciable impact deaths started shooting soon Yep shoulder shoulder hallways. Fantastic job Foghorn Leghorn.

Where “it’s never even isolated” ridiculousness come from? Social media?

Misinformation incredibly damaging - it’s actually insane. use brain pretty obvious. Look demographics people dying. Look age group. look proportion vaccinated.

In UK, people dying 80. 99% vaccinated many third-world countries 160 nuclear missiles space programs? don’t know long IgM (the antibody mostly found mucous membranes) stays around compared IgG (the main one blood). Regardless I’d assume everywhere body kicked antibody production overdrive. I'm seeing 65% Washington state. Good luck fellow citizens! Delaying person classes couple months kids get vaccinated? majority people currently dying vaccinated. posts saying ""no sympathy dead"" pretty horrible.

can link source that? reports i've seeing 95% people ICU unvaxxinated many large population countries heavy undercounts. 20 largest excess death tolls, excess/covid death ratio:

There outright lying (*cough* Tajikistan 100x), like India without comprehensive death registries, otherwise testing catches demand end ratios far 1ish. Well majority UK dying 80, 99% vaccinated majority people currently dying vaccinated

Can link article statistic?

I heard credible news source. Yeah, still old KY home people vote act best interests. AUGUST 4, 2020

Kind old article. Agreed, luckily starts friday, Im sure -10 -20 ICU beds. majority people currently dying vaccinated.

Yeah gonna need source one. saw something said 300-400 doses per day. It’s like bailing boat teaspoon. India option nuclear Space program returned directly indirectly country spends.

Why *every* country need own? understanding they're both. Normally deaths given date they're announced something like guess florida backdate them. Florida actually hit new record daily deaths last monday theyll raise death count day day found out.

And releasing daily realtime worldometer others f-d. aggegators rely service meantime set back fill data. programmer sympathize voluntarily unvaxxed person hospital.

If thats going on... frankly DeSantis broken ""breaking news"", hes conniving brilliant psycho see he's called next leader party. Potentially country. news cycle cant exist late, one care. could thousand dead day would barely scratch politically.

I'm refuting struggle, personal risk, pointing STILL even 15% cases peds, % kids hospital quite low (as % total hospitalizations). UNFORTUNATELY surge cases, ton peds hospitals (because children rarely need hospitalization), we're running beds place. 

I personally okay risk - masked indoors, last year, going fine. alternative hell. We've tried it, we've there, like OP. half year kids home nothing do, refuse virtually learn. hell.  government services report adverse vaccine events, publicly available, reported doctors. interesting see eclipse 5k daily worst wave brought.

Because ""blind"" person yelling back calling government lizard piss fire give shit them? You’re going like answer. No, 623,000 Americans isn’t lot. It’s 0.189% entire US population. It’s roughly amount people die heart disease every year (actually bit less). Again, could many prevented? Sure, likely. you’re right, people losing people reason good thing. 

Why matter many dead hospitalized kids? making policy using numbers it’s important data supports policy. Around 400 children (0-18) died covid. 0.0016% population group. That’s less 20 times likely leading cause childhood death every year, unintentional injury (12,175 kids 0.0487%). data shows clearly children infected risk hospitalization extremely low (less 2%) rate death even lower (0.0-0.03%). need stop acting like sky falling numbers like this, kids clearly face much larger risks lives every day COVID surge. There's narrative moment unvaccinated people dying. know pushing narrative, true.

The majority people currently dying vaccinated. posts saying ""no sympathy dead"" pretty horrible. 

Vaccines reduce spread, problem require strong immune system work properly. Lots old people strong immune systems, age like every system body. 

Would expect 75 year old cardiovascular system 25 year old? 

It's immune system. 

Old people less effective cells, means delayed reduced antibody response infection. 

Taking vaccines protect vulnerable, make invulnerable infection/ death. 

So people saying ""I care, anyone vaxxed safe,"" fundamentally wrong Wow! losing learning. virtual instruction?? wanted normal. It’s anything normal kids  Yup. Stop people moving much legally possible y'all fine. various events need suck require vaccination. negative covid test sufficient. two nuclear states borders want take piece land it, India option nuclear weapons. 

Space program returned directly indirectly country spends.

Of wasteful things (that India does) point out, pick nuclear space programs?  likely immune system recognising foreign body. think it’s understatement amazingly body produce specific antibodies learns. damn use lot energy, main thing heard drowsiness. need continued strong border measures years come. vaccinated minimum requirement entering NZ, still pass multiple covid tests managed quarantine period. suggesting 7 day quarantine instead 14 vaccinated people medium risk countries. basically stay masked distant forever? Don’t partake activities enjoyed COVID gone? Vaccines light end tunnel still believe . you’re alluding future we’ll masks forever , rarely socialize, don’t agree it.  LOL super constructive, thanks.

Now saying people deserve suffer time due lack knowledge helping anyone. makes things worse. Mocking making people suffer - reinforces 'cabal blood drinker' stuff.

Framing benefit reason bosses think employees come back. employee benefit way living closer job employee benefit. vital part accessibility makes workplace flexible everyone. animal born viruses can't mutate vaccinated people that's saying?

Wrong. kids already infected.

And infected kids school, bring covid home families, go work/go infect others BOOM - cases explode. I'm refuting struggles - raising kids huge challenge, let alone 3

But consider long term repercussions children catching covid; brain damage, blood clots, even long covid. really understand long term consequences among ages.

You catch education, like anytime. can't necessarily get kids health back get really sick. India nuclear power since early 1970s current space projects sanctioned 2019. things mutually inclusive.

The pandemic merely exposed fault lines exist healthcare complex third-world economies, especially ones globally connected high population density. Still, relatively younger population less obese/diabetic patients per capita many western countries saved asian countries unimaginable bloodbath.

Not mention sleazy start vaccination program, recently picked pace (30% single doses, 9% fully vaccinated, 500MIL doses) already better many countries lack nukes/space programs/ kind scientific research. spend ~$40 two doses vaccine spend thousands antibody treatments. Oddly enough, virus could end resolving climate change problem. Insane prioritised Why? provide significant decrease death rate one two? jnj shot death rate chance low dangerous drive car is, im scared that. got third booster yesterday. doozie. starting feel better. First two pfizer march apirl. Got Moderna last night saw better delta variant. Symtpoms similar second pfizer shot pronoucned. Body ache, chills, fever, shivering, sore arm. shot 4, went bed 9:30, woke sweat 1 thats heat cold flashes started. Starting feel better now. Luckily likely yes. would outlier study. I'm vax enthusiast, student science, history, economics; yet, sympathetic know better. Education vaccines privilege, denied many. people deserve compassion, convert towards enlightenment values care, indifference.  following laughing wanted succinct.  gracious patient. Kudos. blood bath. entire critical care unit filled Monday unvaccinated patients, heartbroken doctor told seven cancer patients surgeries would wait.

This really illustrates selfish remain unvaccinated. What's alternative? Easy! Delta variant spreads faster deadlier larger percentage population! \[opens google\]

""how vaccines turn magnet"" - sitting around actually talking person obviously never going change easily. Ie keep saying 'just get help you' may actually convince - need show evidence - science, see real vaccine contain microchips / heres works.

And like saying people news constantly saying get vaccine, yet people know better get - issue - need talk people directly. Explain.

Not say people talking forever news means give talking people know better. 

Its like saying since know something therefore person know deserves suffer - actually took time figure talk people help person understand. Fill knowledge know help equal. People change, people snap delusion knowledge. inadvertently undermining confidence vaccine. anti vaxers social media saying ""those '98% hospitalized unvaccinated' stats fake they're going back beginning vaccine"". point - counting hospitalizations vaccine widely available useless information best deceptive worst.

Ah, *do* know would needed. realize, however, people dying would literally shooting ones trying help scenario. They've already discussed amongst themselves! answer English contained analogy, us may native speakers may harder understand intended, I’m sorry.

Example: statistically expect 100 cases infection specific situation. 
- activity “a“ gives 50% protection 50 cases.  
- adding activity “b” gives 100% protection *than activity “a” alone* _doubles_ protection activity “a”, 25 cases. 
- adding activity “c” gives additional 900% protection *than activity activity b* 2.5 cases. 

If 250% protection divide number expected cases (1+2.5) (3.5). 1 left representing cases (100%) expect without activity, number right improvement.

If activity gives additional protection (0%), number cases would stay same, would numberOfCases / (1+0). 

Personally prefer notation “improves protective effect factor 3.5” misunderstood, too. I'm immunizer, usually see 50+ patients day. Nowadays, patients see usually want to, dumbasses would come even though diagnosed covid days ago. terrified even days. spin what?

“This type behavior tolerated Eanes ISD,” Leonard wrote Tuesday. “Our staff front lines pandemic; let’s give space grace. Please, asking everyone kind … fight mask wars schools.”

The incidents reflect growing tensions around mask mandates schools students return new academic year coronavirus cases surge. Last week, parent California allegedly yelled school principal mask requirements struck teacher. parent banned school grounds.

Covid cases Texas continue rise, driven highly contagious delta variant. past week, cases rose 11 percent hospitalizations increased 21 percent, according Washington Post’s coronavirus tracker.

Despite dramatic increase evidence showing children likely contract virus contagious delta variant, executive orders Republican governors banning mask mandates restricted schools’ protective measures. Centers Disease Control Prevention recommends students, teachers staff K-12 schools wear masks indoors. 
 
Some counties Texas, including Travis County — home Eanes ISD — defied governor’s order. Earlier week, Dallas Independent School District superintendent said schools would require students staff wear face coverings despite Texas Supreme Court siding governor battle mask mandates. Similarly, Bexar County San Antonio also require masks public private schools judge granted temporary injunction Abbott’s executive order. 
 
Stephanie Elizalde, superintendent Austin Independent School District wrote essay Time mandating masks situation city “dire.”

1. Let go school person, masks. acceptable: summer school trial district showed district cannot relied upon ensure people wearing masks, eldest respiratory issues young vaccine. 
2. Remote learning district. Painful, kids Chromebooks day needing monitored. Especially youngest, needs work reading. we'd access school services, including speech therapy whatnot, curriculum grading would handled us. Painful, doable. 
3. Ditch district, home-school. Requires massive time investment. Ultimately reasonable right now.

PS: yeah politics definitely broken, that's topic another forum. live South think may over-generalization entire region. live, even though vaccination levels low mask mandate school, job ( one largest private employers area ) requires masking anyone on-site still enforces strict quarantining rules exposures, local government buildings mask only. went Dollar Tree morning mask-wearing 50%.

Take disease already carriers unsymptomatic... make unsymptomatic respect struggle. hard. tons parents similar positions. data shows transmission schools kept minimum *if* proper precautions taken. know applies Delta, plenty health officials saying schools absolute last thing close massive impact children parents. 

School's demonstrated given proper tools keep things safe, spread fairly low. That's disgusting people literally threatening public health officials mask mandates school, governors straight outlaw them. They're outright sabotaging proper response fucking everyone process. Several schools commission *weeks* south right due mass quarantines, virtual hybrid option boot, too. Everyone loses nothing, end shut things anyway. 

Schools open sake children's education mental wellbeing, goddamn people making awfully hard keep open. course got rejected wrong measure use situation.

What need supplies, specialists field hospitals, sending unmanaged crisis irresponsible; resources best deployed safely utilized, keeping reserve limits burnout.

That said, there's absolutely point they're going deal every issue upstream - aggressively stymie flow new patients. time vaccines, masks, social distancing, managed flow traffic stores, etc. could done job; they're still needed, letting get control they're stuck aggressive measures like enforced lockdown shelter place again, tends longer made obvious attempt anything correctly. graduate back vaccine passports. commitment needs come leadership made mess first place.

Edit: I'm condoning insurance fraud. throwing hypotheticals. Listen healthcare system go BOOM Explosion Right, even they're strict, I'm wondering right 8 months supposed get it...would safe get less 8 months? like count resets 8 months time get it? freedom!!!! think so. Shows effective vaccines mitigating severe disease USA 8,054 breakthrough hospitalizations *reported* August 9th 49 states territories. number obviously probably higher now, latest number available CDC's website. these, 74% aged 65 older. makes sense, group also average highest number severe comorbidities. Sadly, ~20% breakthrough hospitalizations, 1,587 people, died. Again, numbers higher 9 days ago. That's bad news. 

The good news tiny fraction people consider 166,000,000 people fully vaccinated. still people, still tragic, look numbers actual danger vaccinated people ending hospital worse, dead, still ridiculously low. coincidence seeing largest spikes areas lowest uptake. Yea really credit homeschooled interests. played multiple sports throughout school, play 4 instruments. also read lot friends didn’t view homework. fun.

I time wasn’t stuck bullshit 10+ hours day point. bar displayed represents 16,000 cases really 278,000+. It’s noted graph makes whole thing bit misleading. 

Another (more positive) way looking vaccinated hospitalizations vaccinated deaths actually severely inflated, scale-wise… takeaway question I’m calling covid flu? That’s unfortunate, live doesn’t necessarily reflect US whole. curiosity things like social distancing, capacity limits, masks outdoors required? that’s key difference 2020 2021. original comment implying less place compared April 2020 completely undermines progress we’ve made thanks vaccine.  get COVID, then



It's weird people say stuff like that. hope everyone else get covid. I'm vaccinated, I'm fine. Wait one categories open everyone whenever want? grey area? year. Jury year Delta. Plus much long term damage equals death?  post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Once mutations become uncommon, see booster shots needed little 8 months. mind yearly thing like flu shot. Hawaii island little less 1.5 million significant case #. There’s lot “island small population”. They’ll probably recommend two weeks immunizations like first second doses. Maybe next year we’ll get flu/covid combo shots.   run risk variants population getting fucked hospitals full like are. It’s always best help others.

Also way body feels right now, immune response probably greater second pfizer shot definitely something. put perspective San Diego County live 75% vaccination rate still seeing rise cases.

And San Diego still taking steps limit spread (which support), holy shit. Imagine 15% vaccinated taking steps. Reckless.   Well, maybe. Russians need provide bit 'tail wind' people (or Brexiteers, whatever). Russian disinformation ops decades fairly well documented.

Even 100% effective vaccine, we'd need vaccination rates stop spread. 50% 60% good enough slow little, especially contagious Delta variant less-than-100%-effective vaccines. 

Also, vaccination rates uneven among regions demographics. days Covid mostly spreads among unvaccinated.

The ratio cases deaths changed, rising cases still lead rising deaths.

Plus daily death toll one top posts subreddit also, nothing really shifted seeing number? CDC report number? 535 deaths yesterday based CDC dashboard.  Totally agree. plenty vaccines require 2 3 boosters complete inoculation. Needing second booster Covid doesn’t mean always need subsequent boosters.  common one I've seen vaccines tested cell lines (HEK-293) derived fetus either aborted miscarried 1970s. “I pooping.” one knows. hope able get vaccinated cannot soon able to. 

Personal discomfort going take backseat prevention healthcare system collapse. 

Until higher vaccination rates, masks stay. thought plan (which change) 8 months last shot took double shot?  Whoa!! That's wild link. trying get trial since March they’re spreading it, vaxed people still get it, everyone eligible vaccinations. That's works flu shot see reason that'd case Covid vaccines don’t get it. measles immunity last lifetime potentially this?

Is characteristic virus? biggest issue far decisions made data, data certain things. 

We good datasets happens kids go school. also good data remote schooling now. believe don’t reliable data “remote schooling extracurriculars” oddball combinations, since number people within reliable group families small.

And it’s socialization, even it’s topic comes most. school comes teachers staff look kids education. Friends peers interact with. safe place kids go may otherwise abused home. stable breakfast lunch, may think given absolutely isn’t lot kids. Enrichment activities like art crafts. way get physical activity. Someone talk outside family things aren’t going well, big feelings, whatever. There’s ton things rolled one that, believe not, parents would struggle provide full time job.

Although I'm sure difference someone vaxxed accepting risk catching rona someone unvaxxed is. means stay mostly full even Covid.

American manufacturing one literally powering spread vaccines across world. federal government forced companies prioritize vaccine supply chain contracts. dare get benefits actions. vaccine approved kids, keep KIDS HOME!

Parents sending unvaccinated kids school bad anti-vaxxers going out. give parents pass?  every school district offers type alternative schooling option (including distance learning &amp; hybrid schooling). 111 days since Florida's surgeon general, Dr.Rivkees updated masking guidelines. 5 different meet teacher events. 3 tomorrow night 2 next week.

I joint custody 6 children mother put charter school full un certified teachers.

Masks....nah Abbott said no....per CEO school.

I'm vaccinated, mask discipline leave home much work home.

I'm worried kids year bringing home. Allergic reaction exception CDC making right now. Like others said, point moot. Field hospitals much better solution, hospital ships used absolute last resort. educate don’t understand trying force hands galvanizes legitimizes side. basically already has… provided cost.   seem pretty terrible expert, understand, mRNA vaccines train body recognize spike protein outside Covid virus. infectious versions spikes, ""sticky"" *shape* spikes can't change much, otherwise fit human receptor cells. Kind like key lock. key fits primates, well cats ferrets bats. (That's snow leopards San Diego Zoo got infected, far, elephants heard of?) Covid-19 interesting seems ""fit"" lot animal species, obviously grows especially well humans.

The current vaccine works Delta, vaccine still recognizes outer spikes. Delta strain fought back releasing MASSIVE amounts virus front. vaccinated body holds antibodies shot (*or booster.) fade. vaccine gives body memory make more, needed. previous strains invaded gradually, allowing vaccine perform beautifully, things looking rosy back May.

Delta slams body fast hard, enough antibodies hand, ready use, even vaccinated people end sick. vaccinated even get admitted hospital, enough support usually buys enough time body fight back.

Delta makes sick people spew way, way virus particles lungs previous versions, means one day work school infected person likely cause spread before. Original Covid-19 infectious, probably floated around Italy US states undetected start pandemic. 

Sadly, unvaccinated antibodies hand,, also ""recipe"" given vaccine instructs body fight. Delta overwhelms even strong, healthy bodies, heavy viral load, right start, younger people struggling it.

This masks help, even vaccinated, get less Delta particles physically shoved nose/lungs front, may result mild cases. infectious probably still get it, exposed, even vaccinated. However, already know two vaccinated folks tested positive, zero symptoms. (They got tested around unvaccinated person got sick showing symptoms.) 

Delta going raging while, especially kids going back school. people get infected recover, get vaccinated, especially KIDS get vaccinated, gonna rough there. Get shot, wear mask, hang tight.  Everyone Best use positive effect. Might case coming winter. ""You know die car crash covid count covid death right?"" believe it’s shot. shots. still don’t think vaccines end pandemic. keeping kids home? don't, complain others staying home.  Needed this, thanks.  think something people consider wasn’t bad spot, Florida like 8 cases per 100k pre delta lowest. PA, NJ, NY like 2 cases per 100k time period. 

So reality is, despite similar vaccination numbers, northeast states simply done much containing virus compared Florida now. Cruelty feature bug. explains lot, seems intentionally convoluted.  Look chart. 16.4 5.3 terms severe cases per 100k. Right, course. also assumed jab nothing immune system already actively fighting covid, based knowledge vaccines work, could completely wrong I'm specialist. basically 86% effective compared 2 shots, that's quite impressive. Meaning, compared unvaccinated people, efficacy would even higher. Hopefully efficacy stays long time. Right? general, chance getting cold flu right pretty low, given prevalent covid is. people minor symptoms, covid might seem like cold.

It blows mind people won’t get tested warn people around needed.

The actual case load probably ridiculous. :/ Add fact many vaccinated people symptoms all. list conditions. last one ""other medicines may lower immune response"" sounds broader is. previously said anti-tnf biologics. anyone unclear whether they're medication qualifies, please ask doctor first. immunocompromised time shot based medications medical procedures, people clogging appointments get 3rd shot yet need cause problems people need shots. 

I'm basing need fact actual data show immunocompromised significantly lower antibody levels despite 3% population represent 40% hospitalized breakthrough cases. proposed US booster shot another covid vaccine shot specialized booster shot? follow UK India metric wouldn’t US states peak around mid-September? guess freedom they’ve screaming freedom rip people’s accessories bodies? too? “Take bracelet right now!” anyone actually explain happening deaths there? 

Deaths rising cases cases hospitalizations kept rising deaths plummeted. far aware, nothing else changed. 

It difficult conclude lying deaths never seen deaths, rising cases, plummet cases/hospitalizations plummet. anyone actually know changed reporting something last 2 weeks?   data Moderna booster getting 2 Pfizer? right, it’s impossible control fools, unfortunate side human idiocy, best one responsible loved ones community get shot, antivaxer dummies beyond help, take nonsense graves Lucky them. Texas planning 
 reporting, contact tracing letting parents know. may bit weird question, say [vaccination way mind, previous pandemics (like Spanish flu) able end without vaccination? said contact tracing easier island low population, correct? thread pretty clearly states 85-95% effectiveness severe COVID. Again, real world data incredibly nuanced, also interesting dive into. agree mostly, cannot required wear masks gyms another 5 years. also cripples live event industry, people don’t want go dancing concert pay experiences masked. even test 120k people daily. active infection, know vaccine effect. know want person quarantine around anyone. That's nice lie people tell absolve blame poor health. prove you?

But told aliens definitely landing New York tonight, would probably want source. illegal wear mask anywhere. US big time, 

actually US worse, refuse mask up, refuse get vaccinated refuse care number unvaccinated people clogging hospital systems, proudly, mention leaders promote sort behavior. I've heard extent ignorance anywhere else around world. conditions  got downvoted pointing back 2020 many places restrictions.Large events happened happening many areas.

Interesting article viruses we've 'defeated' them:  one like answer rational, based actual data. Unless throw reason, make decisions purely emotional reactions, enough. Yeah didn’t really mention like said would…I read another comment sub, think one threads though mentioned Pfizer saying antibodies wane 6-12 months. six month highest risk exposure (elderly healthcare workers) 12 months average healthy individuals sounds like settled 8 months that. haven’t already done that? They’re already stopped outsourcing cheap labor. That’s new option started exist post 2020 hybrid remote era. company could done time last decade half. 
Switching remote work existing staff doesn’t remove barrier making switch, unless you’re saying “the ritual office makes bosses fun feel good less inclined outsource labor.” that’s pretty stark indictment office you’re saying it’s pointless ritual entice bosses paying people fair wages. question ""if?"", question ""when?"". natural progression virus. already knew beginning mutate vaccinations last forever. people looking time people got vaccinated? effectiveness wearing people got vaccinated 7 months ago wearing everyone due Delta? could effective Delta people got vaccinated April, May, June example.

2. there's really tests run make sure get vaccine. (or patient) never adverse reaction vaccines medications underlying chronic illness, he/she almost exclusively get vaccine. Ask pediatrician still questions. I'm PICU/NICU RN. aw thoughts prayers think “mostly safe” characterization doesn’t take account prevalence long covid among vaxxed people. It’s “death nothing” dichotomy, there’s lot middle ground. Nothing says small government like removing locally elected officials.  See, that’s asking reputable source, appreciate that.

Hmm, interesting point. country surge test shit hits fan, hospitals overloaded they're fucked. Also know someone died covid test , I'm sure death count accurate think is. One thing's sure though, they've managed keep society functioning lesser restrictions that's commendable friend ventilated 3 weeks now. knowledge though relate questions know sounds cold, really want know many people either:

a) Vaccinated

b) Unable get vaccine (allergies/under 12)

Still, good thing. people still freaking mild breakthrough cases? cases kinda...well....proving vaccine works?  Another days fine. Delta really low serial interval

Source that?  Last saw still unclear whether serial interval shorter. non replicating adenovirus based like JJ AZ think lower death rates surge started ~1 month ago. We’ll see month two horrible result unvaxxed pockets. Russian trolls need fuck fuck right off. said, need stop thing countries. Never forget, made decision disregard health loved ones way back March 2020. still give shit anyone love gets sick dies, otherwise they'd get vaccinated practice safety measures. risk acceptable die, die. 

I remember saying instant downvote oblivion. Winters come go to, still wear clothes year-round public. Mask requirements large social gatherings seems pretty reasonable dress code permanently. Don’t disagree anything there. Alzheimer’s drug fiasco really really bad credibility.

Anecdotally, know people felt fine, got tested work travel tested positive. Would known better gotten tested. Another felt like bad allergies tested positive. There’s gonna positive cases. It’s time bring attention vaccine WORKING keeping people getting severely sick. feel lot anger states libs sufficiently owned, OK that. problem many variables playing this. know vaccines effective, proven studies made approved.

Absolutely not, around 70-80k realistically given absymal testing strategy even tad bit surprising me. That's cost pay keep society functioning almost pre covid fashion.

Dad (71) barely managed get one end February, given second dose end March. wait end November booster. think lot elderly, even 80+ may position limited supply early months year. really, really sucks. :( think vastly overestimating amount people get third shot. places expect less 1/3 fully vaccinated ever get third shot state that's dead last vaccinated 35% highly doubt break 10% get booster. It’s payoff country deserves sides gambled making virus political subsequently overplayed hands. don’t like em bc believe Masks extremely unbendficanry social skills high levels long COVID occurring among vaccinated people upcoming boosters make long COVID even less possibility. stable immunity vaccination help protect vaccinated long COVID, matter much wish otherwise. worry - take it. fine. cope far I'm concerned.

Some best data come Israel, high level vaccination. New data Israel’s health ministry, released Monday, shows significant drop protection hospitalization among people age 65 older vaccinated January February.
The Israeli data cited U.S. officials one reason Biden administration preparing recommend boosters people eight months fully vaccinated. Israel already started beginning giving booster shots people older 50. can't teacher. would've punched parent soon touched mask. sides gambled

Sometimes get new ones, like swine flu outbreak want say 2009? strains weren’t prepared for. flu particular variety cross-species transitions abilities provide new “combos” recombinant interactions. annual booster contains multiple types provide much potential immunity possible. 

The “normal” mutation process slower, hopefully gives us enough time keep resequencing mRNA providing boosters needed. It’s also huge reason get vaxxed first place - keeping viral load minimized reduces likelihood accidentally spawn next variant. dozens studies showing benefits masks limiting spread Covid.

This there's much focus masking staying home instead literally anything else could allow normalcy well good mitigation. We're specifically talking coronavirus here.....this coronavirus sub right? discussing coronavirus? 

He every vaccine eligible for. 

Also can't Republican. I'm Canadian. American would vote Democrat second. 

Perhaps would good idea understand discussion happening spouting mouth like idiot. you’re forgetting Delta transmissible far fewer measures like masks distancing used. feels uncomfortable, needs it. seen parents almost decade now. want make dramatic, that's them. They're inconsiderate . easy! listen whatever media government says! never met someone xenophobic you

You still taking personal insult perceive attack Brazilians. not. umpteenth time, city possibly achieve vaccination rates high. Zürich, Helsinki, Syney yes, even Sao Paulo. That's loophole, that's mouth. may transmit vaccinated people viral load smaller symptoms fewer. makes transition difficult less likely vaccine resistant variant develop spread. everyone vaccinated likelihood new variants developing would decreased would time tackle do. 

As unvaccinated population putting us risk achieve herd immunity. crux problem. 

We getting stronger stronger flu's thats really flu virus works. flu virus 8 genes. Two genes key determining disease. ""H"" component allows virus enter cell ""N"" component allows virus leave cell, e.g. H1N1, H3N2). year different H's N's combine form different types flu's. combinations work better together allow virus enter cell, replicate, cause disease others much. Sometimes get novel combination really seen population vulnerable. usually happens virus component virus makes species jump, birds people pigs people (hence terms Avian flu, Swine flu). Still offered protection. Even virus makes species jump must mutate within us able spread person-to-person. top flu vaccine whose effectiveness partially depends well predict dominant strain flu virus year. Sometimes get right, sometimes get wrong. Vaccines really drive selection type flu strain get. random combination, influence environment (e.g. exposure domestic animals like poultry swine), spread amongst population. Thats years flu virus relatively mild years flu virus deadly. different combinations H's N's, novelty combinations, origins. 

Coronaviruses different types viruses. work different ways. effective treatments vaccines (or least, really prior 2019). pretend know much Coronaviruses Influenza virus assure comparison really starts ends word 'virus'. US production capacity supplying US point, even third doses wastage etc etc. Countries free invest invest vaccine manufacturing course, manufacturing would certainly help negotiating better terms. Countries still free try increase production capacity, even may take time. trust surely every country complaining place line trying figure could domestic manufacturing capability June 2020, else complaints simply ring hollow. know feel bad asking I've found out. first think predated vaccines I'm guessing least wasn't. two last 2 months. That’s exactly it, since far sure fire way know reduce risk long covid get Covid.

It may well different, don’t data evidence suggests otherwise yet. vaccine available US, best? seen clinical studies show efficacy masks. 

Found . . . Odds first school shooting parent active shooter? Masked/Unmasked? Ugh I’m trying make decision don’t know do. I’m vaccinated town anti mask low vaccination rate. kids young vaccine. school board meeting tomorrow discuss mask protocol schools. Masks optional meeting. online version people person allowed comment. basically anti maskers fine going person closed room masks optional, stay online can’t comment. got first shot Moderna today:) can't vaccinated due medical conditions absolutely staying large gatherings risk level seriously impacted covid much higher.

Maybe suck up, stop acting like child, get vaccinated, stop putting community risk. Forgive ignorant question, possible maybe find local parents vaccinated children playdates, least socialize some? states ranked weekly per-capita states ranked total per-capita Mississippi better vax numbers Alabama even start publishing K-12 numbers middle next month knows better, likely worse. We’re clearly utilizing executive orders liberally could’ve done mask wearing vaccines think Americans going postpone conventions music festivals. worth it.

That's way better 0 I'm glad protection, also nearly good mRNA vaccines enough feel comfortable. result, back changing behavior try avoid exposure.

If different data shows J&amp;J offers better protection hospitalization mRNA vaccines actually bad, I'd love see it. Hoping J&amp;J info soon. time decided J&amp;J better nothing, hearing new booster info really scary. mix match sign Pfizer/ Moderna booster! nothing prevent it

Half country vaccinated. Even look death rates per capita unvaccinated, hit simply population density would half (leaving unvaccinated out). Also add s-ton unvaccinated already got infected 100% protection, also reduces significant amount. Also, someone mentioned vaccination rates really high older group inherently less death baked in. Finally, access monoclonals reduces deaths further. 2500 doses set expire end month. Pfizer going extend expiration. Realize doses way going make third world country. may well use them. can’t serious. data easy find I’m looking you. actually police/district attorney. Regular citizens press civil charges, criminal charges. police ask people want ""press charges"", really asking is, support us testify behalf DA decides press charges. TV shows movies served muddy waters understanding process. DA decides I'm pretty sure teacher's recourse civil lawsuit. Moderna Pfizer said third dose similar side effects second. may give smaller doses (Moderna trialing half dose) would potentially fewer side effects.

Oh, full disclosure since CXR already apparently thinks jealousy issue. **full** ability work home choosing dont want others company pick additional work home. community spread. Nobody office tested positive, could got restaurant, bar, train, anywhere really. October 3rd booster, baby! trying go anything, I'm going research papers I'm reading.

Not mention many teachers children go school daycare take days sick need isolate. 
If unpaid time risk losing insurance many us may going work sick perpetuates problem. 
It’s broken. feeling like annoying case flu congestion that? Here's one smartest people ever podcast completely ripping Joe new one sure starts right spot.  Watch waspes you’re home. COVID animal reservoirs. going test every animal too?

It’s going become endemic. learn manage it.

Also, “we”? Bezos funded money. nothing government. go get sun. mandating certain days week everyone come office

Might best idea full office infectious disease circulating. Apparently 15, 2 days ago:  subject article people favor masks. let’s America solve everyone’s problems? absolutely was. like 7 days ago played yesterday today hospitals HUGE spike. Idiots. Came Chris Gaines comment. Lol. remote options kids unless provide Dr note medical issue. 

So I'm guessing pretty much shit quality. obviously want offer it. 

One kids also get OT PT. can't done remotely. Totally screwed. Sooooo like India? Nebraska They're slow rise. school year also dropped nationwide NPIs. unlike countries 95% seroprevalence measured adults, vaccinated almost nobody 18 (only pre-existing conditions, started 16-17 2 weeks ago). Can’t blame lost $$ revenue they’ll facing guess. let get straight…

He’s paying lip service “encouraging” vaccines, requiring vaccines state employees anything. 

Meanwhile, he’s banning mask mandates schools, trying pull salaries school board members defy simply getting replaced. 

So basically nothing mitigate spread, one might even say, working measures mitigate spread.

All encouraging people go get Regeneron’s monoclonal antibodies get sick. 

And biggest campaign contributor raking dough they’re invested Regeneron…. 

I’m sure it’s illegal, be. depends age bracket. 60 probably better chance Delta surge over, especially hot spot zones. 40 chances hospitalization remote fully vaxxed up. gotten shots single dose, well basically running across busy covid highway hoping get hit. helps small fraction people eligible vaccine, said. 
It also probably palatable legal butt-covering perspective, technically option want vaccine. 
Most importantly, hits vaccine-hesitant hurts most: saddling minor inconvenience. We've tried sorts rewards lottery drawings such. Whoever left unvaccinated combination people never *ever* get vaccinated people go get life kinda sorta complicated little it. remember, don’t believe Covid, think it’s immigrants, Jewish space lasers, whatever fuck, won’t effect think will.  already locked whole country aggressively contact tracing. good reason NZ managed remain virus free long.

I'd okay odd WFH day, time. miserable went full WFH lockdowns. enjoy little time gained commuting, make basic human interaction need life. got bad I'd excited three sentence exchange cashier grocery store! people defying state. fighting save kids lives making masks required lol :) load crap. Don’t recommend booster healthy said people get much protection wearing mask indoors dining out? No. Fucking no. everything supposed do, I’m going live like hermit I’m old sick enough get booster. 

I’m going wear mask inside friend’s house? family doesn’t live me? OR. could get booster. 

What bunch idiots. dr also dont know. assuming reaction nth shot linear relationship, assumption would fear something I've knowingly exposed twice contracted once? already evidence body defended well research ha shown natural immunity good vaccine immunity, would take additional risk? I've already taken ultimate risk, got virus. Garth following proto, quite surprise! honestly idea Garth still touring even still popular. Moderna may bit better pfizer, they're close. J&amp;J simply worse single dose, takes longer effect, could give better long-term result get mRNA booster (this seen trials). 

It seems scientifically clear delay second dose long possible, probably moderna better (4 weeks) pfizer (3 weeks) UK (12 weeks) vastly better Israel (3 weeks). “normal” mutation process slower, hopefully gives us enough time keep resequencing mRNA providing boosters needed. It’s also huge reason get vaxxed first place - keeping viral load minimized reduces likelihood accidentally spawn next variant.

So, means next covid mutations may fast infection lethality and/or vaccine evading? booster shot match original 2 shots going Moderna Pfizer first two possible? kill even further. industries can’t afford business two years row. It’s “having fun” many places permanently close down. think vaccine requirement perfectly acceptable. able get collab need effective single workday - leaving rest work week nose screen work.  makes sense all. 

People vote LIVE, work. Nothing changes respect people working home. Yep. It’s easy. ask dumb question (and probably asked pointing welcome! 

I saw question: thought there'd probably knowledgeable answers here. 

Is end point? (Specifically US I'm definitely also curious worldwide.) scientific consensus around that? 

I'm optimist nature I'm hoping still answer yes. little search seems indicate herd immunity takes hold 70-90% population protected. 

Currently 51% US population vaccinated. 

It also appears approximately 10% US population disease. add two numbers together say 61% protected disease therefore we're little 9% away herd immunity? 

Similarly, seems like New Zealand ""beaten"" COVID. 1 case first months? Well done! countries well? 

Thanks advance wisdom, fellow redditors. :) They're going likely yearly. single Rt value entire US. highly location specific. 

Any organization person claiming otherwise wrong. People severe syncope paired heart condition. Appreciate response. got second Moderna shot mid-February. I'll getting booster. places rising hospitalizations beds, hospitalizations cannot rise further?

It's really hard know. Moderna dose 100 mcg x 2 doses 200 mcg total, Pfizer's 30 mcg x 2 60 mcg total. Moderna slight edge higher efficacy Pfizer. booster dose got before, variant specific. 3 days typical get covid test make sure. plenty cases ppl gotten infected getting shots, even right 2nd dose. especially true regions lots spread. percentage ? I’ll keep hearing 9x% hospitalizations unvaccinated lines initial studies  
You're good news then. According 8 month data, [the antibody response J&amp;J vaccine actually gets STRONGER time, addition, builds robust cellular response, contrast mRNA

I hope WFH zealots realize side equation irreparable harm economy.   First all, Iceland Covid deaths since May. 

Second, 93% adults vaccinated. means 10x vaccinated people unvaccinated people. Based data article, breakthrough cases 2 times higher non breakthrough cases. that's per capita, that's overall. Meaning 7% country making 33% cases. demonstrates CLEARLY individual far less likely get vaccinated. 

For example, taking data posted, let's look recent peak day infections. 95 cases vaccinated people occurred day. 95 infections (about) 95% country's vaccinated adults. That's 1 infection every 1% adult population. Now, day, 45 cases amongst unvaccinated people. 45 cases 7% population means 6.24 infections per every 1% population. 

If unvaccinated, per data suggest, 6.24x likely get COVID Iceland right now. course exact, graph doesnt show exact numbers rounded percentages assuming Iceland perfectly 50/50 male female, article breaks vaccination rates way. fine.

Also, WFH office got redone sit/stand desk first come first serve seating. can't stop virus without coercing people way get vaccinated. lot people care getting sick, care dying COVID, care variants overflowing hospitals anything like that. care enough wear mask, enough get vaccinated think they're healthy enough Xenu protect on.

If there's nothing stopping people going lives, get vaccinated? want stop virus, coerce people, regardless whether business regulations, vaccine mandates, restrictions. Plus, official messaging placing far much emphasis personal need vaccination enough vaccination means community. whole community gets vaccinated mean life go back normal: hospitals fine, people go fairs concerts backyard BBQs bars.

The trouble is, people time, vaccinated give them? Nothing care about. read snippet article young guy NYC said going get vaccinated restaurants starting enforce mandates wanted able go dates. people would call selfish, grand scale things, motives matter. matters he's going vaccinated that's one less person taking healthcare resources still helping community.

Will mandates make every single person get vaccinated? course not. lot people, like guy, change tune lives affected need vaccinated.  Same. First Moderna shot great horrible. Second shot wild, painful, felt-like-I-was-going-to-die, ride 36 hours. I'd gladly (and I'm sure will, soon-ish). want stick vaccine originally received.

Gov. Greg Abbott Texas tested positive coronavirus Tuesday, though symptoms, governor’s office announced.

An ardent opponent mask vaccine mandates, Mr. Abbott, Republican, taken opposition requirements way state Supreme Court. Mr. Abbott, fully vaccinated, isolated Governor’s Mansion receiving monoclonal antibody treatment, help Covid-19 patients risk getting sick.

“The governor testing daily, today first positive test result,” statement said. “Governor Abbott constant communication staff, agency heads, government.”

At least 10 sitting governors — four Democrats six Republicans — tested positive coronavirus since pandemic began, according reports compiled Ballotpedia; four lieutenant governors, Republicans.

Vaccinations Texas lag behind many states, coronavirus deaths rising, though far slowly prior waves, given majority state’s oldest vulnerable residents vaccinated. state averaged 14,700 new cases day Monday, increase 53 percent two weeks earlier, according New York Times database.

Mr. Abbott, 63, faced withering criticism coronavirus cases increased sharply Texas available intensive-care beds dwindled Austin cities. maintained ban mask mandates, prohibits local officials imposing restrictions communities.

Fear frustration course pandemic Texas, nation’s second populous state, come schools preparing reopen, raising worries spread virus.

Last month, responding Centers Disease Control Prevention issuing new guidance recommending fully vaccinated people need wear mask indoors high-risk areas, Mr. Abbott doubled opposite direction. issued executive order prohibited local governments state agencies mandating vaccines, reaffirmed previous decisions prohibit local officials mandating masks.


The governor also affirmed schools could impose mask mandates students; public health experts warned ban could lead another surge cases.

Late Friday, Mr. Abbott’s ban suffered least three legal setbacks, state attorney general, Ken Paxton, said taking issue State Supreme Court. setbacks areas Democratic leaders, rampant coronavirus cases rising hospitalizations.

The State Supreme Court sided state Sunday, granting request emergency stay appellate court ruling would allowed schools make face coverings mandatory.

As virus surged, Texas Department State Health Services requested five mortuary trailers federal government Aug. 4 “as precaution,” Douglas Loveday, spokesman state health department, said emailed statement. mortuary trailers kept San Antonio, though none requested cities counties Tuesday, said.

The five trailers scheduled arrive Texas beginning Friday, according spokeswoman Federal Emergency Management Agency. heart breaks children. 2nd wanes 3rd doses offered considered fully vaccinated? viral load vaccinated unvaccinated delta. people masking games?  person, thing. give recommendations reason know pharmacist falls category.

Futile means ""incapable producing useful result"". stops transmission COVID, produced useful result.

The way lockdown circumstances would futile would impede COVID spread. would mean COVID spread virus manifests fashion. Yes, Israel faster U.S, (and pretty much every country) widespread vaccine rollouts, meaning population experiencing waning protection vaccines sooner rest us. It’s reason FDA suggesting 3rd dose 8 month mark.  Thus far never community outbreak quarantine hotel system. two earlier outbreaks.

That's obvious country, plan yet action none states enough 2 doses vaccine rate happen.

Don’t respond fear mongerers  LOT old people close Az safe enough guys comeon. Yeah vax hesitant myself, got 2 weeks offered though.

Was ever time intelligent, thoughtful leadership, always over-the-top stupid??? what's going Hawaii? bad?  60% First dose 50% full.

Lol, wasted entire education 1250 dollars. idiot. odds death certainly close zero Delta vulnerable, mother passed away Florida Covid Delta days ago. fully vaccinated, diabetic previously liver transplant.

Her daughter works hospital brought home spread like wildfire. Covid brutal elderly. discussion due hospitalization fears, last wave first one UK mostly vaccinated. 

You're confusing caution wanting eliminate virus. reasonable concern Hawaii shown high vaccination rate always keep hospitals seeing surge.  Oh ok makes sense. guess denying service either, able seen vaccination knows yet love hearing touch Americans comment situations uneducated on. reduces viral replication. general progression less virus = less severe disease.

Once Covid, genetic environmental component severe case get. Scientists close marker test highest risk, we're yet. means anyone potentially could show severe response due risk factors ideally treated MA. course, availability cost factor many people, Abbott. People saying like flu shot, not. First, get flu shot every year. new shot target particular strain dominant season. This, way getting shot made original virus, delta variant. would like getting last year's flu shot, year. 
Second, even Pfizer told vaccine 42% effective preventing Delta, instead making booster targets delta, want take dose made last year.  Time buy stonks.  Australia transitioning towards living covid approach per Doherty Institute recommendations 70% + adults fully vaccinated. Sounds like shift strategy. coupled vaccine programme would take us around December year trends going are.

Stop It. stop.

Stop comparing flu.

The flu kill rate.

The flu cause icu beds dwindle, cases go negative.

There ton information vaccines, especially mrna ones read on. already internet, favor read. Severe covid protection wavering much. sterilizing protection taking nose dive asymptomatic/mild slightly dripping.

Those last two important spreading potential long covid perspectives. Same. literally easier job *while* COVID afterward. Wanting know well. 

What happens get &lt; 8 months &lt; 6 months?

I find CDC website 3rd doses immunocompromised people get 3rd dose 28 days second dose. Yeah it’s actually quite simple…

You think people education would figure out?

Kids 12 can’t get vaccinated… sending back crap shoot best…

And delta variant contagious combined children’s lack discipline (touching other, proper masking, fingers nose, mouth etc). doesn’t take genius see what’s happening. still offering remote learning option least… saying daily rate 0.065%. That's low.  Says who?

They’ve already paid just-announced mobile units? Gas trucks outfitting? They’ve paid *in advance* doctors nurses administer it?  It’s simple vaccine shot. indoors people likely place catch it…not necessarily AC lack fresh air flowing through. believe felony. surely hope he's prosecuted fullest extent law.  Calling banishment fire-resistant houses flicking matches place, turning water supply,  shouting freedom claiming invisible deities instructed above.

Sounds clinically crazy me. hey, maybe simple psychotic breakdown. worry, capitalism's back. love road trips still put plenty miles car...just commuting. Herd immunity was/is wishful thinking time being. 
We talked though children assured repeatedly moving target best case scenarios. 
At point need open honest. Like many us saying since early on, virus variants likely either remain years come simply mutate away accord, much regard.

Is common? Anyone else seeing this?


I’m generally curious, trying spew misinformation. I’m fully vax’d extremely pro-vax. well versed statistics easy get distorted impression. Relevant:  spits.  gladly gave lives economy. Yes. presumably watch TV surf Internet sometimes? little reality surely must leak occasionally? get tested, know ""good enough"" level is. account rest immune system important parts anyway.

Testing population happen anyway would cost ton. Much easier offer third dose. Delusional people danger others. need protective supervision. shouldn’t decision makers much less given platform manic street preaching. ?? Israel 57% hospitalized vaccinated they’re vaccinated nation. COVID already begun ignore vaccines since it’s everywhere Earth. There’s variants evade vaccine already. Actually, read morning misread, according this, data Isreal showing effectiveness severe illness falls 55% 8 months 65+ got two doses Pfizer. aren’t 0 still pop remote populations. 

They also less likely asymptomatic spread. 

They also go animal reservoirs easily

Smallpox stable double stranded DNA virus- won’t mutate like COVID.

 I’m saying give you’re hoping eradication you’re likely going disappointed. easy would’ve eradicated many diseases got first dose Monday completely kicked ass. covid December, assume that's sick first. Hoping second better, I'm nervous lol  lazy be? lol Opposite. require negative test everyone, even vaccinated still contract spread covid. I’m doctor anything, but

Then literally give advice covid rare cases yes course, like catching flu disease 30+ vaccines one ever thinks getting yearly. end point *probably* getting covid become less harmful, seasonal virus (like flu) vaccines safely cover vast majority population annually.

No, cannot add 10% 51%. fully vaccinated (51%) also \~10% reported cases. answer probably less 61%, though undoubtedly unconfirmed/unreported cases people never got tested.

With delta, fully vaccinated longer means get covid. I'm sure target ""herd immunity"" keeps changing. unfortunately still die. Vaccinated safer 99 percent. even close. taking stage….

Ben Ghazi Buttery Malesssssss Awesome thank fair largest contributor global donations world. completely agree it’s location specific! website also breaks state, states Rt 1 Rt &lt; 1. Overall us, cases going exponentially - Rt values vary across country. can't really compare vaccines viruses like that. vaccines last longer, don't. viruses worse other.

Without delta, likely really even talking third shots general populace. low vaccination rates, became problem. Cases plummeting April early June delta got foothold. mask mandates kept like month longer might stalled delta.

Being exposed would act like booster, hard know really wear. many people may still really good antibody levels. cost policy, get everyone blood draw antibody test, wait results, decide criteria gets boosters not, say get third shot.

And basically swinging hyperprotecting willing using partial herd immunity slow unwilling. best solution, that's at. mean, personally see anything wrong this. would prefer sick coworkers stay home. masks immodesty different.

Nope. aren’t.

You believe Bull Gates, 5g, microchips, etc. fair amount skepticism point. dad got quite sick, wasn’t nearly dying even hospitalized. He’s considered high risk though. “Beds” well known English speaking medical field linguistic shorthand “available patient care capacity.”

This true, also theory-based ivory tower kind thinking - would nice could this, basically fucking way going fix developing nations poor vaccine delivery infrastructure next year (or even 5 years). Like Israel's example, reach point practical thing best people, means booster shotting US want -- good throwing doses countries infrastructure administer doses widely degrade. guy given vaccines, need check he's giving saline. Moderna vaccine updated Beta, evasive, since March/April - called mRNA 1273.351. also noted Delta specific formula developed called mRNA 1273.651 last investor press release (a week two back). Finally they're testing half/half 50mcg total dosages variant specific original formula. Initial results w beta specific booster showed improved response Beta clear result better (prelim data). FDA already said need another full phase 3 trial - they'll need safety trials almost done beta ver. seems likely original formula prob best option least Delta specific (of half) available.

Also, first impression article bit light facts bit heavy best case scenario. Article June. Ignore. troubling, way think.

The majority UK deaths vaccinated delta. 94% vulnerable, elderly population fully vaccinated. higher now, I'm averaging time period. 6% vaccinated contributed third deaths. Mostly old people die disease, orders magnitude.

If larger amount vulnerable population unvaccinated, instead dominate deaths. 22 percent unvaccinated vs 6 percent uk, end 4 times deaths general, instead 6 percent giving disproportionate 33 percent deaths 22 percent yields 80 percent. definitely going well broken uks data, include partial immunity, rate, deaths mostly vaccinated, well vaccinated population. Better young vaccinated better too, want slow spread. Well going happen eventually. Well need quicker developing distributing boosters we're going knock out. contagious ""natural immunity"" strategy work. time gets partway infecting world going mutate start reinfecting people already infected before. might actually good thing.

As neutralizing virus, Delta simply overpowering them. numbers game. vaccine gives 100x antibodies needed neutralize earlier variant infect, delta comes along 1000x viral count... unvaccinated people feel genuine compassion cannot take vaccine due LEGITIMATE medical reasons - autoimmune disorders, cancer treatments, age, etc. piss rest fire. Worldometer says 35,000. think low 80's usually high end occupancy often low 50-60%. Something often overlooked tho 90%+ occupancy rates happening states rapidly adding icu beds temporary structures, parking structures, even hospital ships.

Downvotes coming, I’ll take booster shot road release 6th one road lol hope I’m wrong hope places don’t mandate boosters granted access places otherwise I’m grab popcorn see ensuing drawback (I already got 1st 2nd doses I’m anti-vax fan annual boosters) I'm Kansas get worse sure. ton people havent got vaccine people didnt even change lifestyle last year theres way they'll accept precautions year. We're lucky mostly spread small population we'd probably pace Florida Texas people living here. read London allowing than, changed minds.

We called Health PEI, allowing it. also parent tired lack nuance debate.

I know American Academy pediatrics said agree everyone in-person ideal *normal world* however reality lot school districts needs done make in-person learning safe kids, teachers, community large. Parents shouldn’t throw kids grinder alternatives. Teachers shouldn’t forced put lives and/or health risk either. 

Obviously, keeping kids home ideal social development living historic moment things going different we’re going survive nation, many, individuals.

However, also know way society set many parents cannot reasonably afford virtual schooling without appropriate supports work government (unemployment payments, stimulus checks, etc.) 

A remote option benefits parents want keep kids home cannot; less kids school right better. easier social distance kids in-school therefore help mitigation. 

(And doesn’t in-school teacher both. district digital Academy several years year.)

Maybe wishful thinking things would better don’t understand districts didn’t prioritize improving digital options case. way things looking looks like lot schools going digital year anyway. schools AZ session week already school closed due many exposures.

How likely catch Covid, someone else Covid, fully vaccinated fully vaccinated well?

Living household *this* wave. Vaccine policy necessarily, given time frames involved, planning next one. Scotland got brief reprieve delta wave things starting shoot back here. That's thing does. goes up, goes makes think safe, goes right back again. two pandemics happening... one viral, other's dumb. lot people nice replies, I'm going sugar coat it:

These science denying scum claim simply need educating *are actively MOCKING people fighting lives Facebook, posting misinformation!*

FUCK 'EM! Random video calls boss. India world's second-largest military force third-largest defence budget world. 40-year-old program, 160 nukes continually added 40 years. 

If want progress develop country, industry, commerce, education research, building massive defence industry. That's difference South North Korea.

Sure, couple dozen nukes aimed Islamabad Beijing - stop conventional wars - spending *six* times Pakistan ludicrous. third dose booster takes dose away someone vaccinated (who able chosen willful ignorance), I'm point better point. They've enough time, need prioritize health &amp; people I'm around Need state emergency authorize kind triage. would like add/expound: Waning antibodies completely normal body actively fighting something otherwise blood would thick oil antibodies many different things. 

When body sees virus immune memory B cells start making antibodies again. cells still destroy infected cells antibodies try go virus fuse cell. seeing this? Covidactnow showing steady climb Oh yeah feds great data, remember said masks work? Everyone agenda Hey I’m SAHM virtual school didn’t work us, either. think we’re getting used assuming people sticking heads hole ground simply express concern way certain scenarios playing out. work music, last thing want another lockdown - work booked end year lose work second time I’m screwed, considering unemployment pretty much ends everyone position September. would also screw massive festival like lollapalooza over-reaching adding available tickets even prior covid creating scenario causes localized lockdowns major touring markets. see couple shutdowns major cities guarantee see mass tour cancellations (more already seeing), would destroy many touring routes make lot tours financially unfeasible. 

The pictures lolla prove mask compliance virtually 0 - feel like statement “not needing check pics cuz policy right site” also method sticking head hole ground. need people festivals want adhere festivals safety protocols. want able work rest year man. Last fall remember articles mentioned flu vaccine shot might provide least minimal protection severe COVID-19. 

Does anyone know research done that? Wondering go ahead least seek under-12 kid can’t yet get COVID-19 vaccine. Usually don’t flu shot later year potential help I’d get early. It’s hard say it’s much higher what’s reported. know one elderly person US suspect died covid never confirmed case. site counts excess deaths gives clearer picture. rates *2030*

Is something know future telling us? see begin September 20th now. News came out. emphasize ""after 8 months"", going enforce this? example, able get shot March due two comorbidities. I'd feel better getting 6 months start next month, allowed? I'm obviously sarcastic. lot countries along. US reportedly going recommend people stick one got originally unless extenuating circumstances (and idea could possibly one). explained million times virus mutates situation changes based new information.

Seriously, stop trying make things black white; really going way pandemic. need learn adapt. Someone another thread suggested Florida lag reporting weekend. Still, ease Delta variant passes one person another caught public health experts surprise. June outbreak Australia, virus previously well controlled despite extremely low vaccination rate, New South Wales Health Minister Jeroen Weimar warned transmission occurred “fleeting contact” individuals. example, contact tracing genomic sequencing showed woman 70s infected sitting outside cafe visited “Patient Zero,” airport limo driver. another instance, virus seems transmitted time took two unmasked strangers pass shopping center, encounter captured mall security cameras. you’re vaccinated don’t serious health issues you’re fine. Go live life enjoy college. You’re likely get sick drinking Doesn’t fit definition child endangerment? Something really needed ask: ""vaccine evading"" really serious bad explanation virus acting immunity jabs may offer? Far reading kinda hard understand, even experts even tell kinda normal happen older people bodies answer like younger ones. Also properly proved variants indeed make vaccines weaker immunity. exact experience backed studies. fact adults push like person issue. Kids ultimately care like 2 weeks. kids die school bus accidents COVID. Let’s keep things perspective. left previous job moved full remote position facility Seattle living New Orleans.

Better pay, pretty much organize hours, full remote WFH, commute, work anywhere want... fuckin great. way See examples provided wrong. None things airborne disease part human-life forever.

Fantastic. 

Any future employer need offer WFH option, I'm taking offer. ""backup plan"" even right backup plan.

I'm abjectly impressed much undermine every protection book - vaccines, masks, systemic controls, call inappropriate assistance (an sea ship Mississippi) things, predictably mind you, go rails.

It seems like pissing match who's going pay fuck-up, governor's using constituents lives sort reverse-chicken game.

FYI, hits keep coming Congratulations, welcome back sanity. Unfortunately though, people unlimited reserves patience understanding. sure don't. 

Experts less trying tell public what's happening year half. nice imagine perfect world knowledgeable people willing repeat thing months years everyone gets it, they're human too. understand there's expectation free, unlimited empathy rational people. That's great way put it. seen this? “fleeting contact” I’ve seen reported mall. speculation outdoor transmission MCG, many experts still believe transmission took place concession stands restroom. also big stadium many people present rather someone passing another street. Unfortunately, lots folks best shape. left previous company July WFH option, team carried perfect scores entirety 2020 carried 2021, increasing production ratio. given option, long maintained ridiculously high metrics, work home full time. I, supervisor, team manage person, going required come office 5 days week. 

Got job another company, permanent Hybrid, company car get work home 3 days week, within couple years, full time home. Best decision I’ve ever made. Yeah, Brazil India. Economist tracking excess deaths worldwide incomplete data doubt 40M deaths. 15-20 maybe, data incomplete poorer countries data (especially Africa). I've struggled quite bit. really depressing realize large portion populace is:

A) Unintelligent, 
B) Easily manipulated/influenced or, 
C) Both

I'm sympathetic towards (A) (C). unfortunate truth folks simply below-average intelligence. pandemic complicated sympathy trying right thing know believe.

But I've got nothing B. They've brainwashed. They've willfully looked past irrefutable evidence order live fantasy-land. reality pierces bubble freak out, often turning violent. They're poster children cognitive dissonance. They're pathetic.

And groups gotten ultra rich brainwashing? IMO deserve place among evil groups history. think draw line directly lies deaths millions. Surely people going end summer vacations /s Lower population, lower density, *fewer ICU beds per capita* ([by factor never happening failed. zero sympathies them, like drunk driver, take risks themselves, innocent bystanders love them. anyone else misread think 40 million dead India?

I data India, China, Indonesia, Turkey  Today first day school am. really wish could excited it. still understand following safety guidelines CDC, AAP, every children's hospital, university, major pediatric practice state even debate. really frustrating. Vaccine approval 12 can't come soon enough. early trial data effective boosters vs delta? fully vaxxed no, healthy adult, don’t get flu shot every year. Covid isn’t flu flu shots aren’t boosters. It’s harsh, get anyway point Well fair people saying rare because, literally equates 0.0001 something percent chance happening entire vaccinated population, even happen, treatable well known vaccine specific.

If compare clinical trials drugs available public would probably surprised risks even simple shit like aspirin. 

I don’t want sound arrogant, research, might find people feel way.

At end day, enough people decide get vaccinated, course population hesitant, inherently take risk get infected. vaccine won’t save point. fair, husband early twenties. surge coronavirus cases. Whatever post pandemic future looks like, keep place. work life balance working home better anything I've experienced previous jobs would like keep way. Wait, exactly insinuating? agree you. think that. 

Experts lose track boundaries expertise. Politicians boundaries. Lifting mask guidance driven politicians pushing CDC engage social engineering (way outside epidemiology immunology) ""incentivize vaccination."" socialogist indeed person street could predicted would would happen: everyone stopped wearing masks engagement risky behavior ballooned. They're backdating deaths day death actually happened day death reported (that is, death certificate issued).

Since imagine they're massively swamped due massive increase deaths, probably takes decent issue it. deaths near term (previous couple days) always near 0.

To get real number deaths, repull older death numbers compare current number.

Yes, done way make seem far better basically fudging data (Even though, eventually, numbers pretty close correct) Yeah, go look India couple months ago. Hard fill basket empty seats house. 100% flu shot coverage. almost vaccinating virus requires people get vaccinations mutate further. \*exactly\* works. early data released boosters effective delta? got hit hard early. 3 top 4 states deaths/million NY, NJ, MA.  Yes. I'm wearing KF94 everywhere hoping protect 9 month old son. alarming number teachers wearing masks since required. mess worse numbers portray. Hard stop delta starts spreading. People saying “just wait, numbers going explode school starting.”

The kids already infected. cases don’t show two days. child infections already baked models. makes sense, subsidized fed according article though. wonder insurance companies willing pay it. 

I find kind funny people want vaccine willing sit infusions experimental cocktails. watching much futuristic science fiction moving pictures ya? Delta incubation 1-2 days 1000x viral load. That's spreads quickly bright side, 36% unvaccinated state like Wyoming really 36% place like Alabama. Way way lower population/density quit en masse. Yes realize that’s feasible, really don’t see alternative civil disobedience result unemployment too.   Here's Federal Government step in. We're literally playing games children's lives. simply true. current hospitalizations vaccinated higher that, every country keep better data higher breakthrough that. 80% elderly vaccinated, significant number deaths vaccinated. actually want percentage vaccinated deaths higher. number end 99% would reflective massively high deaths, unlikely happen. uk majority vaccinated deaths, far better coverage elderly, consequently higher percentage far lower number. Northeast similar. south many areas not. People misinterpreting data mean state intentionally trying mislead people. much think DeSantis made many glaring mistakes, minor one best. people make attempt understand seeing problem. general populace bears large part blame content ignorance. 54 % fully vaxxed. 70% least first dose. Kinda seems like vaccinations less optimal ? Unfortunately, need still care hospitals capacity. never know need medical attention, even Covid-related. hospitals full Covid patients, everyone else's healthcare suffer. downvote? said worth downvoting?  Ohio.  Moving next goalpost. ""Kids die sometimes ever think that"" typically asking proof age 12 year olds now, options. Really? heard this. 

I really think he's trying save face point. wrong pandemic choice double pander twitter followers, even risks getting bunch children sick. sad really. Part CDC saying vaccinated people don’t need masks indoors without strong data back up. yes, choices causing people like buddy's mom spend 3 days ER without ever getting real room DeSantis donor large investor this. America even anymore? None enforced subway New York, really fail see point. Right now, I'd recommend Moderna. seems little effective combating delta. side effects second shot little worse, though. took Pfizer probably try get Moderna booster. asking ""real"" president help? difference NZ going full lockdown immediately. brought school, that's bad believe delta spreads fast. 

LSU ( college school) said delta case causing 6.5 others Good that! remaining people going need time convince get vaccinated. would optimistic. Data (only April 30th 2021) shows Russia officially recorded 110,000 Covid deaths; total excess deaths time-frame 500,000. dumb ones loudest pushy. Unfortunately, I'm afraid right. Covid Zero gonna maintained long term NZ people vaccinated get Covid 19. 

Their goal keep things control people vaccinated. don’t know Delta focus suddenly shifted back case numbers vs hospitalization/death numbers. Zero Covid never happening. Dude, block move on. guy 5th grade education. writes 'vaccines mutating'. smh.   sign kid trials, heard anything. enough information point. Kids getting sick, hospitalized, dying. emergency situation FDA dragging feet. matter school board says. governor said schools enforce rules requiring masks. Yeah, guess mixing makes sense, circumstances. sure would convenient boss. Lol many dying something else hospitals full? time delta wave hit, lot people vaccinated. teachers' pockets quite likely. Teachers pay much measly salaries already, see buying classrooms especially high risk themselves.  I'm already vaxd. Including abortions? Damn, really going hold back Mississippi's education ratings one thing haven’t heard discussed is, metric ending time around?

What local health authority say? website. Regardless, good metric test positivity rates 5%. seems pretty expected me. CPR article indicates 20% cases Colorado breakthrough cases first 3 weeks July. Using simplifying assumption Colorado 50% people vaccinated (it actually 51-52%) time, relative risk .2/.8 = .25, vaccine efficacy would 1 - .25 = 75%, seems right. involved calculation would say 77% efficacy think.

* [CPR [Vaccine efficacy using relative curious, reacting sick? treating like Covid planning tested isolating? treating like cold flu? Roll Tide. doesn’t shorten testing timelines. Places started asking end may. Seemed work fine place excited open excited bring vaccinated people. People option go anywhere else since wasn’t mandated city wide. mean. It’s good info people high risk take precautions, aren’t already society shame non-maskers people clear severe symptoms didn’t stay home?

Do we? either thing. Comfort Mercy. One stationed Norfolk one San Diego/Pearl Glad places finally laying hammer down. somewhere like Dallas Miami. Imagine uprooting whole life kids don’t wear piece cloth mouths. Insane. like positive pressure airflow.  still potentially save states Australia NSW even regional NSW there. Might surrender Sydney, though. ""Other nations early successes virus, Australia, also shifting strategies brace COVID-19 deaths era disease stay. one world's vaccinated countries, Singapore ***may first*** show really means.""

Emphasis mine, phrasing implies Singapore preparing immediately endemic COVID Australia get eventually. added list people want vaccine getting sick. # GOTTEM That’s interesting. Everywhere different! Tuskegee thing always cited people get vaccinated. basically excuse. ignorant get vaccinated likely idea Tuskegee experiment. Maybe issue targeted Executive Order Emergency Declaration banning negative numbers? Surplus ICU patients also sounds better. Couldn’t dosages off? I’m guessing hope could case. well. breakthrough infections asymptotic mild. 0% chance conservative majority. I'm even willing bet $100 conservative minority chance happening. everyone vaccinated Covid risk death/hospitalization would similar flu. risk accustomed taking.  good news: now, you’re adult vaccinated double dose mRNA vaccine like Pfizer Moderna, experts talked believe Delta variant likely flu hospitalize kill you. Additional context, it’s huge 1,000 Los Angeles Unified students tested positive coronavirus two weeks leading Monday start academic year, according “baseline” testing results, rate infection crept since close summer school July L.A. Unified large — 450,000 students expected attend classes person, number student infections also large, totaling 3,255 students, overall infection rate .8%. infection rate among district’s staff smaller, .6%.

Glad they’re testing classes. switch requiring vaccines requiring masks again? Mandate vaccines ffs. endgame?? Abbott scared COVID, matter much tries downplay it. 

He's 63 year old male who's 2-3rd worst age category COVID. student tested positive student exposed wore masks students potentially exposed need quarantine they'll informed it/ told watch symptoms. either student didn't, quarantine.

If they're asymptomatic allowed come back days earlier get negative PCR test. got 100k hospitalizations dying winter peak. chart shows amount people hospitalized US site  Honestly figured post gonna get votes. visible probably would lost karma 🤣 New deaths:  We're still beds lol time difference infections? know, anecdotal sciencish.  hope health officials administrators learn experience inform public things age social media rampant misinformation. intervened long set realistic public expectations vaccines let companies oversell it. Internet echo chambers (like sub) amplified problem. even declared pandemic first results announced posting upvoting articles young people ready get back ""roaring twenties"". Division zero error.

And yes...  Yeah, shit. Negative beds? Sounds like positive freedom me. Thanks this. waited make Covid (day 8), get vaccine doc says can. anti vax, lazy, thought healthy need worry.  may point. considered that. all, they're viruses infect hosts. great.  work Trump?  


All seven people map room helping Trump prep debate got sick. Everyone testing negative went West Wing. plan almost killed Chris Christie. That's impressive feat ""owe"" hospital beds.

If people talked mask mandates, social distancing, vaccinations.

Seriously, 35% fully vaccinated. expect happen? still indicates good protection given Americans vaccinated. feel like U.S. world gonna see natural/vaccine immunity looks like couple years. Obviously unless covid literally mutates 3-5 times year never get it, honestly might happen.  think unexpected.

Problem people saying high percentage (99%) covid cases/hospitalizations un-vaccinated. always using cumulative data early 2021, vaccines widely available.

12-24% current covid-related hospitalizations vaccinated needs considered backdrop 50-70% vaccinated populations. covid vaccines nothing, would expect hospitalization rate roughly equal vaccinated rate.

As people get vaccinated, percentage vaccinated hospitalizations approach 100%. population hits 100% vaccinated, 100% hospitalizations COVID vaccinated.  Immunity is.... complicated. antibody test checks certain type antibody, multiple ways immune system ""remember"" antigen still test negative antibody test. pretty good article rundown different antibody types interested: also fun stuff like T-cell immunity, really use antibodies all.

So long story short, testing negative antibody test really tell much body's immunity. agree commenter talking doctor concerned, really be. vaccine freaking amazing preventing severe illness gotta trust immune systems thing keep us safe :)  don’t know. always warned pirating movies lead computer getting virus. /s  fascinating tweet Israeli data making vaccines look great showing simpsons paradox debunking theory. vaccines great job still

Basically high risk groups likely vaccinated, going make data unfavourably compare unvaccinated low risk groups.

Perhaps goes show need concentrating getting vaccine old vulnerable even avoiding severe cases order day. buddies vaxxed got it. Cousin vaxxed got it. I've heard vaccinated people close co-workers got well. Doesnt really seem rare.  Thank you!  live Ohio able get pretty early on. I’m guessing would’ve got second shot April May. masked kids quarantine well? see sounds nice muh freedoms get second vax curiosity? story amazes me. He’s local business owner

Partly horrible idea hospital simply cannot field surgical suite, icu bed, couple specialized surgeons dozen people needed week.

In Houston ginormous medical centers!

And partly somebody survive many gunshots shoulder/neck. shot sitting car grocery store - accidental domestic dispute nearby. turned relocation package Pasco county three years ago. Thank God. according people sub still want vaccinated wear masks. outpatient bully phleb order tests doctor order. phleb caved (which absolutely done) critical value. critical value ordering provider. pathologist ended calling patient sending ER tried reach GP. 

Long story short, critical due medication GP knew exactly up. showed hospital see patient told behavior abhorrent discharged needed find new GP. charted conversation patient education. really stay  anyone offer insight question: vaccinated Pfizer, would beneficial get booster Moderna? Gotta love title NYT Opinion piece: “Actually, wearing mask help child learn.”

Yea….I’m buying it. yes read article sounds like reach whole way. Yellowstone last weekend long planned trip camping. absolutely blown away amount people. know busy place summer matter what, god damn beyond packed everywhere. everyone unmasked course. would say due Delta. study completed prevalent strain covid-19 infected vaccinated unvaccinated people. study proved variant strains prevalent vaccinated people, thus speaking efficacy vaccine original sars2-covid-19 decreased protection variants. really, really want see evidence regarding waning effectiveness severe COVID they’re citing Israel data, that’s huge DOH! Moment…

Not I’m boosters. They’ll help controlling spread, especially vaxxed country like US, need see data claim effectiveness severe COVID Wow, much anger unless measure. go find mask mandate works thread learn reduce spread 2 whole percentage points. Victory last.

Go covid ward hospital guess doctors nurses wearing masks protect protected. 

Wear nappies leave rest world alone. Yes, mean employees side. bad there. help explain office workers making $30k may hard time, good Internet may hard come you’re making $30k year. Wtf? Oh. I'm sarcastic here- theory case rate also drop 1-2 weeks, everyone could catch already has? Last year first time able remote. company headquartered across country maintained small office us here. pandemic closed office manager time asking finding new one us. said I'd rather remote, approved, feel like overnight life became better. I'll never go back unless absurd offer. Cause job probably becomes redundant you’re monitoring adult bathroom breaks vaccinated protection dying hospital. unvaccinated not.
btw, lost family member today covid. GET VACCINATED. We're week 100 quarentined students. Maybe 5 teachers positive. mask mandate, distancing. I'm sure much. We're starting realize hope we'd person year dream need plan virtual. small chance. possible, two fully vaccinated people living together gives best chance spreading catching covid.

The vaccinated person covid high chance able kill virus, vaccinated person covid high chance catching it.

You can't really put number it. one point pandemic vaccines, lived household 5 people including 4 got covid once. able stay covid free throughout situation. 100% normal California county. 100% normal everyone America, except people living few.... special... cities. wish would delay in-person school start October save children’s lives. really stupid. either A) want give money B) incentivizing schools hide cases C) trying privatize education D) retail pharmacies offering them! 8 month would end September I'll traveling country then. wish would bump weeks extra protection traveling. everything I’ve read surge Delta (which imagine worse fall/winter) would prefer get booster 6 month mark (which would put end September). wonder strict going time since allow appointments starting September 20th. check cards ensure it’s 8 months? Otherwise it’s tempting claim immunocompromised status order get third shot 6 month mark also officially recorded CDC vaccine card (in case need proof 3rd shots point).  get third? I’ll getting one! incredibly misleading. 1 million double vaccinated people, 100 died within 28 days positive test. That’s 0.01% even (big if) due COVID. 

Obviously people vaccinated going die unvaccinated vaccinated people overall. teacher shortage around nation - schools need poach florida teachers It’s still sign vaccine new treatments effective. think that’s positive really. Plus Walgreens now. Walmart, sam's club, Costco, grocery stores pharmacies. initial rush may issue really forsee issue first month so. Plus booster already least somewhat safe. Maybe prioritize brand new people finally getting first vaccine kids eligible.
Maybe nursing home mass vaccinations can't travel select things. places mass vaccinations sites probably needed now. Irresponsible egoistic offer booster shots much world population received first shot yet. New variants keep developing unvaccinated part world. US focus large part unvaccinated population   Surely 8 months shortest time observed Pfizer efficacy drops healthy people 60, full range 8-12 months. 6 months, among healthy people, that's optimum time shot greatest impact immunity. different recommendations different risk classes. comment automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Gatherings banned, get see family another state year half.  allowed go work, big deal me, hated sitting home computer day.

My dog diagnosed cancer eventually died, allowed vet appointments.  stress able euthanized something wore long time, able find someone willing outside, December.  bought bunch portable heaters setup canopy medical tent.  spend ton energy last week trying arrange moment dog.

Technically could secretly met large groups private residences gotten trouble anything, but, followed rules friends followed rules.  social life trivia night zooms every often, one neighbor friend whose yard I'd beers in.

And kind disrupted everything found comfort in, gave boosts help work past life stress. Movies, dog parks, gatherings, traveling, volunteering, parties, breweries, group camping trips, park outings, restararunats, happy hours co-workers. gone long time, still fully returned. many things people used part life still really returned. One best friends moved away cancelled flight back visit, group camping trip really looking forward got cancelled, rise cases people's reluctance groups. happy hours co-workers returned.  I'm still lot isolated last March.

I mind masks things like shopping traveling, think hugely impact relate people can't see other's faces, smiles, conversation cues, etc.  Everything distant.

We restrictions cities did.  friends regular people took COVID seriously, many still do.  anymore. traveling everything.  Except almost always girlfriend, getting together groups still little dicey.  Would better? Noted. Obviously basic grasp physics without knowing valve actually works could take best guess. according New York Times tracker. checked. really seem think death negative outcome. MIS-C long COVID organ damage nothing burgers. It’s bizarre me. already pull in. 8 months near side range given Pfizer, already conservative approach. Older people immunocompromised pulling efficacy averages, average person, robust immunity shown last 12 months. DeSantis GOP pols send kids private schools?

there's rub. like playing stock market. Book numbers high, travel low...rinse repeat. There's pretty big middle ground ""zero covid"" ""exponential growth"" see right now. recall experts ever calling zero covid, seems like straw man. Remember cases nearing 10k plateau June feeling pretty good? get back work drive even lower. Covid endemic also affecting every single community nation/world time. fine.

Eventually, vaccines available entire population, they'll make decision open things world. point, virus going run amok NZ, even 80%+ vaccinated (just like seeing Israel now). Severe outcomes greatly reduced eliminated still enough tax health care system. Someone get blamed.   mention people (supposedly) devolving much possible control local level.

(That's actually lie, course; empty rhetoric used 'conservatives' things going way, tossed aside things are) idk rude. Vaccines fully engaged prior april would include data obviously skewed ?  Yeah read articles say thing. September ideal. Sucks really good options kids yet brainstorming.

Thanks reply. Hold on. School started. know probably consuming diet Newsmax Christian pastors preach you’re better everyone else you’re religious think don’t need follow rules care anyone yourself. 

BUT fact masks protect people. wearing mask would protect people covid. disease ridden, don’t care anyone else gets sick, body maskless, you’re much likely spread COVID others. Including vulnerable risk death. 

I know know this, come back BS claim, riddle this. doctors wear masks surgery? think it’s protect themself inhaling smells surgery keep mouths warm? 

Surgeons wear masks protect person operated infected. cover face mouth case sick, don’t create infection open wound. That’s also scrub hands extremely diligently. It’s protect patient. 

I realize living life asshole takes responsibility must fun you. However, risk child dies complacency also won’t care. thank lecture wear. 8 months puts earliest group basically around / couple weeks now. think it’s recommendation based current circumstances rather science dramatically different 6 vs 8 months  September perfect timing. 6 months comes October lol

I wonder we’ll able go moderna booster initially vaccinated Pfizer.  truly understand. Honestly. 

With 50% US population fully vaccinated, NY 70% - back place vaccines? everything open? 

It add me. Unless breakthrough cases rampant means vaccine effectiveness good limiting serious disease bad stopping spread?

Many agree COVID endemic. sound like we're going fully eradicate virus think objective needs change. 

I many questions... Trust me, wish could. things country easy right going take time change jobs can't afford quit without something lined already. I'm vaccinated office now, really hope enough. separate battery charge Texas. criminal charges like charges varying degrees assault.

Here appeals court case references teachers public  police, prosecutors judges never pressure cause part problem.  1) asthma mean child can't get vaccine?

2) tests child take make sure he's safe get vaccine? Schools shifted school calendar, gone remote vaccines authorized age groups.

It feels like pressure taken government approval overestimation protective effects masks long duration group setting mostly unvaccinated population. Political polarization lionized one visible NPI expense others. Retrospectively, contribution cumulative effect masks part comprehensive NPI strategy estimated 20%. Removing NPIs tested winter like hybrid learning, isolated student pods, quarantine rules give us result want, especially face much transmissible variant. Instead spending energies thinking effectively educate kids remotely, shift educational calendar, choosing fight single NPI strategy that, pretty much studies note, needs combined NPIs full effectiveness.

Sure, bring everyone back use masks reduce doubling time average transmission. effect original strain reduced doubling time cases average American school 2 14 hours. transmissible variant, level reduction probably means get month school everyone infected instead couple days, masks vs masks. result want students get infected, need think keeping home. Got mine yesterday! say effect? No. course did. point *shouldn’t added significant number tickets* blatant money grab untested system. Thank god 200ish reported cases (who knows many hundreds unreported cases though), “barrier” seemingly effective doesn’t mean people wearing masks event *good* thing. You’re reading way deeply words, considering I’m actually deeply ingrained “universe” question here. fair, really high efficacy even vaccine basically coded pre-Alpha virus, given absolute minimum spacing terms optimal immune response. inconceivable future re-coded vaccine, possibly multivalent, could provide broad enough deep enough coverage mostly snuff COVID. Needing yearly vaccines, like flu, exception rule. intranasal vaccines require live vaccine (similar nasal flu vaccine)? so, suspect it’s live viral vaccines considered safe immunocompromised groups take. wouldn’t widely administered vaccines available.

1) everything open. Even areas masking, full indoor shopping, dinning, work offices, social visits. chicago, took covid seriously, it’s basically like 2019. 

2) delta contagious wide margin. Back delta tiny portion cases. 99%.

3) vaccines losing effectiveness time, hence need boosters really really pissed phrase ""being sick like dog bed"". people understand vaccines currently fully prevent long covid? fuck deny responsible people protection long COVID? Thx Thx look back mRNA vaccine results came out, FDA set threshold 50% consider vaccine “effective”, first vaccines example 56% effective, would approved. efficacy seeing delta still original threshold.

We got lucky mRNA vaccines way surpassed 50%, 2 unfortunate things happened. vaccines effective wild type, federal government tried turning COVID personal responsibility issue instead public health issue. vaccines considered somewhat “forcefield” Covid whether risk getting sick considered determined whether “took responsibility” health (they used exact term) got vaccinated. CDC removed mask recommendation vaccinated people, people asked “what happens unvaccinated people don’t wear masks expose vaccinated person”. response time along lines “the vaccine efficacious you’ll fine”. longer holds people still expectation near sterilizing immunity. unfortunately changed pandemic response somewhat US viewing pandemic personal issue instead public one, need switch back viewing public one. second part lot people want cast doubt vaccine thrown idea vaccine useful provides sterilizing immunity, bit crazy. It’s moving goal posts type deal, personally believe lot people make argument don’t actually believe using straw man. consistent argument, wouldn’t wear seat belt example still get hurt car crash wear seat belt, seat belt won’t assure don’t get hurt minimizes chances.

I totally agree need reframe people’s expectations vaccine. Vaccinations always effective population level. matter much protection vaccine provides individual, always safer pathogen circulating circulating less best way stop circulation many people possible vaccinated. Youre bringing surges. Im talking preventing surges cases. said easier contact trace island small population. Source? whole period lately feels like playing defense full approval. time decade ago super rude suggested pedo.\[..\] hey kept asking prostitutes age children   time returned Canada Asia, 3 years, customs fucking crazy. Got thoroughly questioned gone long? know people go Asia sex children.   5 minutes (n.r. baggage pickup) \[...\] hate Canada? proud Canadian? fuck children?

If complete BS (which sure is), asked three separate occasions specific thing, sex tourism/pedophilia (which sure not, especially way presented ), start investigating going on, (and probably close family too) black list (but sure probably already know why, enjoy raising stink). Boosters necessary young &amp; healthy situation stands. R0 Delta strain really 8-9, need least 85% people perfect immunity prevent exponential growth via vaccination alone. 90% effective vaccines, anything short everyone getting vaccinated going enough. Given vaccines probably like 60% effective \~5 months (and lot people got doses January-March), two doses simply enough control Delta alone. many states taking actions prevent measures taken (ie: schools allowed require masks). 

The vaccines seem good preventing death. Serious disease though? sure that's true long-term. least Israel, something like 60% hospitalizations fully vaccinated individuals (which make 80% population). Unvaccinated people make \~20% population \~40% hospitalizations, they're over-represented factor two. means hospitalization rate reduced 60% vaccinated people, vaccine preventing 60% cases first place. Seems suggest pfizer vaccine original dosing schedule provide significant protection hospitalization 6 months except preventing cases. like you’ve given minimum wage increase.

No, doesn't. inventing problems distract complete failure argument.

Which pretty clearly MO. literally nothing value offer. I'm starting notice uptick FB page 'hey brother/sister/cousin/etc hospital vent need prayers' messages community. think starting hit home people. 

My wife counted last night recieving news younger brother mutual friend we'd grown passed away covid ( covid either ... long drawn affairs hospitals vents ). came least 3 people personally knew general age bracket ( mid 40s mid 50s ) passed away covid. kids. Eventually probably going 5-10 people ones. different 80+ year old great uncle passing away people remember going 5th grade with. choice, I'd get ""old-new-variant-plus-the-original"" Moderna "".211"" booster, that's going available ever think. Yeah... gotta FREEDUMS! I'm vaxxed currently it. Symptoms bad though. Happy vaxxed. Oxford started clinical trials intranasal vaccine October would now. Instead nothing whatever reason intranasal vaccines still priority there’s 80% fully vaccinated 99% deaths could still 20% aren’t.

That's what's happening UK page 18. Direct government surveillance report, 2/3 deaths vaccinated people, majority recent COVID deaths older vaccinated people. makes sense, that's expect see? I'm sure people railing OP? Kinda weird.

Despite case numbers peaking last couple days Florida, death numbers fallen cliff last week (according Worldometers). numbers accurate? hope sake people, thought lagging nature deaths (and horror stories hospitals Florida), we'd see deaths peak week well say like winter ain’t right around corner lol aren’t talking zero covid. talking easily avoidable illness, hospitalizations deaths. may care many unvaccinated people hospitalized dying it’s destroying health care system many states workers fleeing treat them. Many jurisdictions increased penalties assaulting school employee. I'm sure whether applies Texas not. 7 people Delta variant obviously changed things. supposed match time 12 vaccine? mean pain book kids shot since everyone rushing third dose?

I wonder science changed figure since babies kids gets tons jabs time extra caution till knew more.

Either way, flu shots coming thats good change know. booster mainly help protection infection. Current data suggests protection hospitalization death still high. body’s B cells retain memory long first shots, booster not, grants long-term protection. Getting exposed could act booster, you’d run (small) risk getting infected also possibly spreading it. spend 40 tax dollars two doses vaccine spend thousands antibody treatments. A. relative population. according UK data, [page 18 directly comparable US, vaccinated over-50s 13x less likely hospitalized. inexplicable US track federal level, might find state-level numbers somewhere.

I'll interested keep following Dave Blake's data whether prediction hospitalizations peaking right hold true. enough vaccines there. Meanwhile many people countries haven’t even got first dose yet. something similar. I'm young, health problems, getting exposed Delta constantly work. nearly six months along, would waited bit constant exposure. Side effects mild, hope right thing. feel could risk gap. I've spend hours side side people unvaxxed testing positive. South Wales hit a [record number new COVID cases — recording massive 633 infections ]()today.

Americans shrouded realities virus. said hospitals overwhelmed southern US. thought talking UK.  video news report site quotes Superintendent saying ""No charges filed... time."" apparently not. Yikes. nobody knows do, asking complicated questions expecting easy answer.

This lay land:

-Vaccines remain effective hospitalization death, effective infection mild/moderate symptoms.

-Masks continue prevent infection spread.

-Delta much infectious previous strains.

-A 3rd dose booster effective greatly decreasing chance infection symptoms compared 2 doses.

-The unvaccinated previously caught COVID filling hospitals protection hospitalization/death vaccinated previously infected have.

Those well agreed upon now. far do, real question ""What want happen?"" based above. want mitigate infections, means masks all, vaccines unvaccinated, boosters vaccinated. Always. “Free patient” isn’t “free”.

We end paying treatment. 

Wouldn’t rather end paying prevention pennies dollar? Um, Catholics Christians last time checked.

Protestant Christians follow Pope. :-)

The Holy See spot since beginning pandemic. Shutting Churches, getting people mask get vaccine. many?  Yes. We’re already peak according several models. See IHME well covidestim.org (a joint project Yale, Harvard Stanford) Yup

The system broken.... surprising. issue this.

I'll take much free healthcare get, honestly. statement HHS released also said protection death hospitalization going diminish well.

""Based latest assessment, current protection severe disease, hospitalization, death could diminish months ahead, especially among higher risk vaccinated earlier phases vaccination rollout."" HPV vaccine schedule adults exactly same- first shot, second shot 1-2 months later, third shot 6 months that. Makes 8 month schedule right line recommendation.

There’s also people get injections various illnesses hormonal issues weekly. 

While there’s always chance anything could cause issues, even severe side effects haven’t lasting 99.99% population vaccines. There’s already countries starting third shots serious side effects, studies started too. wouldn’t worried. agree this. Big cog like organizations see remote wrench cog. always explanation ""we always done way"". Truth told, think another trend hybrid one sticks around long term. can't see fully remote realistic certain industries. said,I always root companies claim go remote. However, need see long keep promise. kept reading vaccine makers would able turn dime modify vaccines new strains. time get approved fda, next strain. mess. \*rolls sleeve\* basically everyone right leaning spectrum, regardless issue. think asthma limiting condition adults, know kids finish testing. second question would best directed doctor.

If unaware group people huge risk getting shot look assuming. sure, grew country every school uniforms never issue. prek age kid goes school uniform, loves it, elementary age kid cried cuz uniform. People love it. companies start hiring overseas workers virtually quarter pay replacing them. that's what's going happen. Quality work damned, companies care. UK Covid Dashboard doesn’t track death vaccination status. vaccine status age, isn’t anywhere near 99% claimed. 

Not mention OPs argument faulty. majority vaccinated doesn’t mean majority dying well. there’s 80% fully vaccinated 99% deaths could still 20% aren’t. annoys disinformation taken anti-vaxxers cry “censorship” “they don’t want know truth.” 

Whoever is. Jfc, fucking dense? Parent normally terrified flu flu vaccine available. delta variant going around plenty kids hospitals now, anyone terrified. kids ICU young, ever want experience ever again. terrified idea kids potentially hospitalized tubes wires coming them, feel sorry kids. Next up, oldie goodie ""It's like .01%"", personal favorite ""They likely killed car crash"". Good times.  Tell R governs state end everyone gets shot.

Not mention OPs argument faulty. majority vaccinated doesn’t mean majority dying well. there’s 80% fully vaccinated 99% deaths could still 20% aren’t. 

Hence request source instead vague statements “look up”. Parent charged assault, restraining order filed, teacher and/or district file lawsuit, child expelled. That’s true. That’s said rate death unvaccinated won’t change.

Por que los dos?  blame without conflict Example: Legal person, working home. Needs original documents sent. Someone office.  Client (new existing) comes place business, wants consult. Someone going take care them.

Another WFH: laptop fritz. needs replace it. instead someone coming person's desk giving refresh laptop, WFH person wait day / day half express laptop sent home expensive shipping costs. person on-site setup laptop security standards company ship WFH persons didnt before. Someone else work person since laptop isnt working.

Another WFH internet went working another city even say 1 hour commute.  work doesnt get done internet service provider (which doesnt put residential service prioirty) fixes could hours come office might take 2-3 hours.

The mailroom, never scan company's mail comes office scan everything specific person. No, everything cant email.

Another person lives apartment want live house responsibilities locally family, cant work home due apartment situation.

Someone always going pickup issues person due WFH.

Jealousy, no. Fairness.  one's WFH situation island everything handled home. people support WFH situations. girlfriend planning attending this. vaccinated J&amp;J plans wear mask times since Georgia Hot Zone right worried.  Good transportation may also hard come making $30k year.

And people including ""hybrid"" options here. low wage office worker can't home office, still option working office. won’t understand perfectly using cover. may dumb question, ask it. anyone read know happens immunity vaccinated exposed Covid don’t catch it? boost immunity/antibodies like would caught it? spouse house kid COVID last 10 days. us testing negative every days. Pfizer 5 months ago Moderna 6 months ago. Looking silver lining mess. Annual boosters may thing, like flu vaccine Ahh well instance get fucking booster loophole Texas locates Abbott's ass originally got J&amp;J, I'm getting again, want better shot. let us get Pfizer shot 2nd go around?  exceptionally high level excess deaths Ecuador highlights enormous burden heterogeneous impact COVID-19 mortality, especially older age groups Indigenous populations Ecuador, fully revealed COVID-19 death counts. Together limited testing Ecuador, results suggest majority excess deaths likely undocumented COVID-19 deaths. comes social restrictions like said? Yes region. comes overwhelmed hospitals? Yes unfortunately correct. overwhelmed hospitals come “normal” things “normal” people behaving even shouldn’t. CDC recommends vaccine technically require it. absolutely wrong vaccinated can't get spread it. 

This strawman. Literally one saying ""vaccinated can't get it."" spoke someone went see play weekend. Fully vaccinated wore mask whole time - still got infected. It’s going tough months ahead, even vaccinated. Yea.

My mom currently hospital. Nurses pretty darn clear number COVID patients doubled past 2 weeks.

They changed visitor protocols, allowing 2 visitors per day. Next step visitors, like peak. Article makes sound though went back school week. case. Many school districts started weeks Maybe, maybe not. It’s pretty individual people react.

If you’re worried, ask doctor think. arguments valid. however point is, trajectory moving indicates vaccines useful long term.

Current data San Diego shows 73% vaccination rate 97.5% people hospital unvaccinated. means unvaccinated people 131x higher risk hospitalized. 

That pretty good proof effectiveness vaccines months later. Moderna February. Sign up! Yeah agree. vaccinated too. sardines sites, gift stores etc limited room move. wearing tons people around outside due amount people. think exactly types show up. look UK government covid dashboard. mean vaccines work. mRNA vaccines, no. update vaccine. Many checking box immunocompromised checking box booster/3rd dose pharmacies check.  Glad got 3rd last week. time wait percentages flu graph, they're deaths per 100,000 population. two links directly comparable.

On scale flu chart uses, COVID US 190 deaths per 100,000 population still going strong. flu kills around 30K-60K people per year, COVID killed 623K us. Yeah, I’m super tempted Per NYT:
Health care workers, nursing home residents older adults vaccinated early first line, starting Sept. 20. “We starting see evidence reduced protection mild moderate disease,” officials several federal agencies said prepared statement. PTSD poor health care workers endure guess waning immunity fairy tale. people sitting around without booster two years create “omega” variant well last paragraph big reason I’ve pretty depressed lately. 

The recent IPCC report shows need drastic, globally coordinated action stem emissions ASAP. Yet look world, especially US, take stock handling COVID society, can’t help think perhaps bit doomed. Huge portions society denying science point death due tribal cultural politics, rampant misinformation, resentment asked make sacrifices greater good bode well climate change. Yeah kids get flu vaccine terrified it. think Delta variant major age demographic shift OG. OG virus hit elderly people hardest - younger folks kids largely spared. Delta hits every age, there's larger pool people infect. People think short term benefit able work remotely there's something coming later blindside everyone. worker work remotely look local area. look workers city, state country. Workers competing much larger pool candidates drive salaries. That’s I’d like (got J&amp;J March) guidelines allow find place that’ll without much questioning.

It’s obvious point US government powers view J&amp;J vaccine red-headed stepchild (warranted not).  Yeah, think it'll take little longer kind problem appear then, right vaccines it. Jehovah's Witnesses Christian Science opposed vaccinations... think fundamentalist Muslims may too.

There's one other, something like Reformed Dutch Presbeterian? Kids smarter adults sometimes. get Moderna booster top Pfizer? actually beneficial? Get tested going anywhere. Lots kids getting cold like symptoms delta. think Florida general also much higher population density area lot less social distancing.. vaccination isn’t working delta disease contagious people get symptoms, spreading without realizing ill. death rate low enough scare people taking effective precautions, social distance enough keep spreading. almost selective pressure less deadly. 

If ten percent infected people dying people would stay home prevent spreading. people getting obviously severely ill contagious would become less deadly would able easily quarantine sick people (or would sick about). would cause selective pressure virus become less deadly. Efficacy what? Getting infected serious/hospitalized case? 1,861 ICU beds left state 40,000,000 people.

Stop spreading uninformed panic.

Kids without socialization playing kids repercussions.  vaccinate hell kids flu well. What's point? [This official release months full range boosters effective. Israeli data shows groups people fall short end spectrum (6, 7 months) elderly immunocompromised, getting boosters first. noted, testing boosting general public 8 9 months second dose. younger healthier one is, towards 12 months protection fall, totally line age best predictor susceptibility observed throughout whole pandemic. nice reply nice discussion overall. IMO, getting booster long high level spread. calms good, hurry get one. Worldmeters cases hospitalizations. There's need differentiate delta western Europe 100% cases. I'm vaccinated I'm outside day, I'm probably wearing mask. really like sardines packed can? Maybe I'd wear one. I'm able move around that's actually pretty low risk environment.

It’s taken decades lot diseases vaccinated small numbers. Well, that's case, Idk, seems like settled 6 months elderly, 8+ months everyone else? seems like elderly get thrown bus bit get potentially put risk 2 months so, CDC say date everyone, unless I'm misunderstanding missing something here.  like herd immunity gained flu. like mutates yearly requires yearly boosters anything. agree. wonder checking people's dates they'll allow us flexibility. would prefer booster couple weeks early, right Thanksgiving. think I'm going get year protection could potentially waning. Stop. don’t know you’re talking about. sorry, they're accurate, show actual study although would help read Hebrew. mention show decreased effectiveness symptomatic disease.

I tell down-votes people scared hear news really, read it.

The worst part I've wanting get booster shot guess what? 

Those scared share news naysay parroting ""leadership"" needed...but even U.S. finally starting move.

Regardless, people refuse recognize science rock gently repeating ""it works, works"" bad ""anti-vaxer"".

Science requires skepticism. accurate reporting. job provide information save lives, even told to. 

You like portapotty chili competition everyone got food poisoning. keep seeing stuff like can’t help wonder line people straight ignoring actual expert advice evidence back instead waiting say.  Non-Canadian here, unvaccinated consider might infect? Young children people can't get vaccinated due medical condition choice. inconsiderate get vaccinated able. think too. maybe even worse complete lack measures like masking distancing. hope dont quarintines traveling. inlaws met son yet. turns 1 next month.  really understand refusal vaccine refusal medical aid pandemic.

Oh, come on. fired person accurate reporting deaths repeatedly shown obfuscating number cases. best assume incompetence instead malice, evidence points malice.  Hmm, going excess mortality 120k deaths total country 127 millions. Thats still much better death rate European countries US. prediction still right. Japan since beginning pandemic never hospital breaking covid. Jehovah's Witnesses changed position 1952 understood vaccines contain blood kind. Underrated response. Probably due long covid quarter survivors. think reality determined endemic (which far looks way) - ideal situation get annual flu-shot. think states low vaccination rates hit really hard hospitalizations.

New York Times dashboard shows 7DA case count falling first time month. Looks like Aug 17 good day... Let's keep going 2nd seems rather anecdotal. many vaccinated people talking ?

FWIW, astrazeneca vaccine near identical J&amp;J vaccine they've tested either [third booster [second/third booster mRNA shown effective safe Local doctors boosters now, trials ones help fight variant/s better. (which personally probably hesitate booster, ultimately personal decision based individual circumstances)

Also lot breakthrough cases people around asymptomatic like people lead believe. Even vaccine sniffles. I've got several people 30s-40s aged social circles barely staying hospital even fully vaccinated spring. Delta different beast. need wear masks, keep precautions wary large crowded events. Also get flu shots. Thanks, Reuters usually quite reliable. guess discrepancy Reuters tallys data faster CDC, talking data 8/17, CDC dashboard Data 8/17, might mean 8/16 data. guess we'll find later today.  We're several months Delta boosters tailored planned available early next year. go first became noticeable disaster India, 8-10 month turn around. variant escapes vaccines could wreak lot havoc timeframe. Well risk people definitely get booster. Still doesnt affect me. know 1000’s people died vaccine, safe?

I'm trying find information. link data found?

What find 50,254,577 doses administered Canada, 109 serious adverse events reported. (Some, all, could deaths).

Now look actual deaths Covid itself. 1,460,000 million covid positive cases, 26,719 people died. 

The proof shows likely die Covid die vaccine. Honestly, know number county frustrating don't. know anecdotally 4 kids daycare tested positive one hospital, rumors idea true. idea actual numbers are.  like vaccine either effective die it. *just* 5 months though? physician recommend you? probably fine, wonder bit people get bit much stuff though death rate estimated 10x reported [per IHME](http://www.healthdata.org/special-analysis/estimation-excess-mortality-due-covid-19-and-scalars-reported-covid-19-deaths), yeah bad time. Yeah, 8 months would early December, would like chance get weeks earlier mid-november worry Thanksgiving. I’ve also heard 100M without sort immunity well. Meaning infected remain unvaccinated. media would believe that, yes. actual data shows vaccine still provides impressive protection Delta.  takes actual work changes policy, much easier suggest people wear masks get vaccines (without actually making sure people either things) since shifts responsibility citizen higherups. Ok, thats fine, body choice. definitely get theyre risk want to. yes, decisions goes shoops body fact shoop. Even anecdote really appreciate sharing perspective. realize around world people gotten chance get even first dose, right? They're irresponsible, country supply shortage. else mentally prepare kids need bring job home spending 8 hours it? 7 100's millions pretty damn good also mandate school board/superintendent decided enforce masks students decide wear one. confronted care, want teachers focus teaching, mask enforcing. Well, schools shut going teach? Open ‘er up! live life cases low alter behavior cases high? match CDC guidance unless I'm missing something. setting rules you? took trip myself—was quite lovely. I’m vaccinated, kids house, come may. ~25% cases result long covid far reaching societal effects. I'm masking boostering family help protect people like you, wish others would. lol...good god people...SCIENCE?

I'm thinking every downvote like bell rings ignorant get training wheels taken evidence NSAIDS impair immunity vaccination weak.  recommendation is, abundance caution, avoid unnecessary. sounds like use necessary.

One survey article Observational studies reporting antipyretic use around time immunization concluded use affect antibody responses. randomized clinical trials demonstrated blunted antibody response unknown clinical significance. effect noted following primary vaccination novel antigens disappears following booster immunization.

source: studies around whether giving children painkillers advance childhood immunization impact immunity.   studies even found increase.  Looks like there's effect, small, noisy, difficult measure. flex think is. patience I. even let waste time anymore; I've got elevator pitch ready: ""I get interesting, challenging work people genuinely like; make $*x* per year, *y* PTO, work full-time home. top pay PTO significant margin still providing two?""

So far, answer every single time. fine me, I'm looking make move. Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes  guess wasn’t specific enough, contact tracing capabilities small island nations states Hawaii Iceland pale comparison similar capabilities New Zealand. New Zealand widely lauded organizations extremely strong capabilities contact tracing case modeling. contact tracing includes genetic sequencing largely unrivaled, allowing understand exactly people got sick see clusters connected. also predict likely outbreaks specific suburb due modeling capabilities conjunction contact tracing. really stick pin it, New Zealand incredible work contact tracing success contact tracing goes well beyond fact small island nation. fact don’t surges large part brought up. clear, New Zealand’s success contact tracing attributable great management government really great usage technology special regard even compared islands small populations.

I’m pro vax, hunted appointments like wild man March, feel like I’m living twilight zone. 

I recently recall reading vaccines miracles effective ever developed…now need booster less year? 

What exposed Covid vaccinated (I assume won’t know since vaccinated) wouldn’t act booster?  say flu dangerous Covid kids 12? doubling occurred last three days. Surely explain translated deaths least. already two buy third safe.  remembered bbc covered american elections thoroughly british ones. think understand exponential growth means. think Rt right now?  Pretty sure skydaddy sent vaccine Half USA leaves ~165M people unvaccinated. 

That’s enough population virus run rampant. 

And we’re facing way contagious virus.

And social distancing measures gone.  We've mixing moderna/pfizer Canada first two doses approved govt. countries well. think recommended US, might change soon! Note folks concerned side effects 3rd dose, far (*anecdotally) looking like getting booster 6+ months (Dec/Jan) fewer side effects getting boosters 4-5 months (Mar/April) probably result fading antibody levels. wonder they're suggesting boosters 8 months? Personally, I'm thinking 6 months myself. high risk folks (vaccinated Jan Pfizer) got Moderna boosters. Zero side effects. third maybe 30th? probably not. you’re public facing healthcare, I’d say general (sane) population would want protected possible esp since exposure increasing delta varient. else fails maybe snag last dose that’s going expire otherwise twisted way right person. happened one wealthiest school districts TX. Teacher going sue easily win $$ hope. Waning antibodies completely normal body actively fighting something.

My kids cold first time since 2 years ago going back school. Pope already deeply mistrusted reactionary wing traditionalists American Catholic Church. argument doesn’t authority make religious duty get vaccinated. also emphasize portions Vatican teaching vaccination claims can’t force people get vaccine, despite majority teaching stating Catholics take vaccine.  send kid school mask. Schools aren’t banning use masks they’re leaving parents. interview job yesterday. person would reporting (should hired) said believes remote work opens available candidates, true reverse. Sure I'm competing wider pool people, also wider pool jobs apply to. Keep mind, Indiana 3 Judge Federal Court already ruled schools mandate COVID vaccines Supreme Court refused block mandate without even asking University One problem shortages facilities, staff, oxygen, ventilators, ECMO machines. think deaths per case could worse last year. That's parents. people children. Mandating vaccine would reduce problem. believe J&amp;J working second shot. Or, guidance may come stating mRNA shot fine. think J&amp;J known ramp time terms protection may quite ok right now. I’m sure diligent Redditors find links you, I’m adept that. I’m told masks actually awesome hate them. suck, they’re necessary suck.  soon retire? already got it, went grocery store told em first. well got mine back December. No, 3rd boosters OKed immunocompromised. Brought British news. love globalized world. never show insurance neither parents friends (that know about). got 2nd jab Feb 4th. Reckon I’ll getting booster sometime October. thrilled hear news declining effectiveness since fly Cali next month. let check calendar see he’ll freeze over. exact Moderna vaccine lower dose like they’ve talking about? boat me. frustrating. results 149,144 people aged 60 received third dose least week ago 675,630 received two doses, January 37 people tested positive coronavirus third jab, compared 1,064 positive cases among received two doses, Maccabi said statement.

Am correct reading saying 86% effective compared two doses, compared unvaccinated? Agreed. vaccine mandated federally reduce problem. FDA approves vaccine, done. That's pretty rough Yes, I've searching google youtube mandates end. even use quotes search exact phrase ""When mask mandates end"" find 3 pages results none answer question. 

I see temporary date mandates extended look forward to. see criteria that's put mandates end. 

It's easy everyone wear mask. extending without end basically telling entire group people, included, reduced quality life die.

I want someone confidently tell end why. got shots. know masks work. know vaccines work safe vaccine. 

But tradeoffs masking. affect childhood development see faces. makes difficult recognize people, especially neurodivergent people. creates mindset fear. reduces oxygen intake exercise, particularly intense cardio. bad skin, much even doctors recommended take breaks wearing mask dermatologists. bad dental hygeine.

As virus becomes less deadly people get vaccinated masks optional again? magic number(s) waiting for?

The issue waning protection mild disease infection, especially delta. booster hoping offer protection against. natural antibodies decrease months following exposure. vaccinated, number antibodies slowly declines months follow. normal delta around, personally doubt we'd needing boosters. delta reproduces much fast exposure (I believe produces 1000x viral load original strain), antibodies abundant, immune system gets overwhelmed infected.

Less breakthroughs = less infections = less hospitalizations death 


Care worker nursing home got vaccinated 8 months ago gets delta, thinks allergies, goes work, infects elderly person got vaccinated 9 months ago, person dies.  


This scenario greatly lessened boosters.  


Map situation thousand jobs millions people- teachers, nurses, people working homeless shelter. 


That's why. can't force vaccinations easily go, best harm reduction strategy national level. really sucks. do? Yeah, made quick bar graph correct scale. vaccinated deaths, see zoom 1000%… even then, looks like hairline.

The ""unvaccinated deaths"" also looks reassuringly tiny. Bar graph problems.  Dumb question... got Pfizer first two, get moderna #3? think it’s shows powerful identity politics politicians fueling culture wars continue galvanize base divide us. 

COVID common enemy. want get back normal. It’s mind boggling politicized COVID is. 

Unfortunately appears test run climate change. Big oil, meat industry, etc. definitely taking notes. That’s really interesting. suggest research papers concluded that? I’d love read more.  What? Kids 12 eligible vaccine required attend school.  No, think it'll take little longer kind problem appear then, right vaccines it.

This seems unlikely, given long far taken create roll boosters Delta. need know variant had. science pick actual date. 8 months probably chosen need new booster spring US population (about also know nothing). pessimistic side tells ""wealthiest school district"" means parents afford better lawyers district like kid's school district doing. He's elementary school, meaning year starts kids eligible vaccine yet. They're requiring masks, teachers also submit proof vaccination get tested week. 

I know testing perfect produce false negatives, helps. teachers JnJ vaccinated though, they're going need booster. want get winter kids get vaccinated safer. 


Also, question everyone--- think FDA taking extra time review vaccine 12 crew lead less hesitancy among vaccine-fearful parents? extra time review, people feel thoroughly researched likely allow kid get vaccinated? so, mind extra time takes, I'm skeptical.

Now, get strong impression people either never realized this, forgot start continuously (maybe politically ideologically motivated too) move around goals posts. media politicians, least them, make matters worse refusing take factors (not people tested positive) account evaluate pandemic situation correctly countries already high vaccination rates media stupidly continues report way past 1 1/2 years nothing changed. LOL. no, definitely not. buried middle post, addressed somewhere!

The efficacy numbers different time different studies measuring efficacy different outcomes. one study might say vaccine 99% effective death, another might 35% infection, including totally asymptomatic infection. See study says actually measuring.

Unvaccinated people make vast majority hospitalizations everywhere. somewhere 99 vaccinated people 1 unvaccinated person, unvaccinated person one vaccinated person hospitalized, well, would look like 50% hospitalizations vaccinated people. look vaccination rate areas too. company work exact opposite. went virtual course single weekend last March -- every office across globe. Even discuss plans re-opening, bending backwards make optional allow every employee determine when, even if, return on-site work.

Wake people! Also lot northern states start school later southern states, average. means we're getting stories southern states far. We're going data need holidays determine much masks actually slow Delta down, course late anything say ""I told so.""

The Atlanta Journal-Constitution formatted data [this really well. school district, tells many students faculty got it, total enrollment district, district's mask policy is. Since still early school year, can't draw conclusions yet, certainly cases districts mask mandates, seem far districts without mandates.

Hopefully release reports like that, since there's bunch districts different policies area, making good going get ""live"" experiment scale. I'm struck way experts misunderstand administration's strategy. admin seem care epidemiology based strategies reduce Covid spread deaths - mostly focused pre-Covid agenda. would able achieve much agenda hospitalization rates deaths among vaccinated supporters start increasing. 

Boosters give chance continue push responsibility/blame onto people get sick next surge - way ignored current surge blaming crazy southern governors. lot breakthrough cases people around asymptomatic like people lead believe.

And claim ""everyone knew vaccines prevent hospitalization death, transmission"" false, claiming everyone knew would need boosters false. may floating around ideas discussed, nothing proven, nothing definite. Many people went sincerely hoping, even believing, got vaccinated good. especially CDC mask guidance changed, many people's fears assuaged thought finally go back living life freely. Especially touting mRNA vaccines 92-95% effective. No, people think ""oh wait, apply transmission"", thought free, safe. I've heard several people, recently.

That proven case eye-opener dose harsh, harsh reality. fully expect many, many people forgo getting booster. also know immunocompromised person 40s terrible reaction second shot couple months ago still suffering side effects, already advised doctor get booster. Oh, definitely everyone. know lucky line work done anywhere.

Known pointed intellectually honest knowledgeable subject, is. mutation concern, can't relevant one here: boosters original vaccine. Israel data showing people recently vaccinated two doses better protection people vaccinated several months ago exact two doses.

While vaccines require doses longer gap, MMR vaccine given two doses four weeks apart good life. Clearly there's something different immune system learns remembers different vaccines (which may property virus, vaccine, both). maybe measles easier fight whatever reason, immune system need prepared it.  lot unpack, wrong.

Sorta - oversimplified bit. general it’s best interest virus easy spread without killing host *quickly*. luckily thus far ebola marburg drastically contained. nasty fuckers kill quickly, faster you’re catatonic less spreading you’ll do. 

Viruses tend contagious less deadly due natural selection - ones manage keep going. doesn’t mean deadly variants won’t show up, they’ll often “burn out” quickly. 

How well virus evade mRNA vaccines depend different are. won’t go super deep genetics here, different types mutations wildly different effects. standard insertion deletion would single nucleotide strand, could multiple, translocation whole chunk gets swapped around. changes may may allow virus keep replicating. could effect, minor one, completely change it. changes drastic they’ll actually kill virus line. principles apply DNA well - mutation could transparent, minor change, disability, render fetus unviable. 

Short answer - advantage rate change currently slower respect creation new variants. Genetic sequencing pretty standard technology updating mRNA vaccines match burden, complete overhaul time. rest unfortunately luck, increasing vaccination rates, social distancing, masks, etc. immunocompromised say mix necessary. 
From CDC:
Can mix match vaccines?

Florida (and assume states) switched method purposely undercounts daily deaths listing died recorded day. obfuscates data often takes several weeks report death. 

Florida, instance, reported 7 deaths yesterday, pandemic record breaking hospitalizations nearly every day last 3 weeks. total death count rose average 200 per day entire last week, backdated. 

Now, apply methodology several states, look bad reporting deaths day recorded time last year. Breakthrough infections still occur, yes, much lower levels they're occurring currently. Hopefully, boosters return immunity levels seen prior Delta, allow vaccinated live freer lives. Health care going become incredibly expensive dust settles this.

They'll say ""They going die anyways"" getting 2% Americans died COVID? That’s simply true. 623k cases population 325M much less 2%...its 0.19% want round 0.2%. 

Next, let put something perspective you:

In ww2 lost aprx 418k Americans. time 0.32% population. Korea 0.0026% population. Vietnam same. add together average population totals you’d get around 0.31% population died wars. reality Covid LESS that. 

And yes it’s important contrast leading cause death US. Why? leading cause likely going get better. lose number people annually don’t really think much it. Covid particular focus point, cases go people get vaccinated, people gain natural immunity, better treatments found. first two literally possible heart disease country. acting like second leading cause stick around forever useless again, evidence shows likely case. 

Sure, number cases kids continue rise nothing. things done. know delta spreading quickly amongst immunity children 12 can’t get vaccine particularly targeted. also know current data available even delta children low mortality rates numbers remain MUCH lower reasons children hospitalized die. 

The hyperbolic reaction covid supported data matter anyone thinks. mean nothing done? course not, prevention worthwhile. really stop acting like world never recover insurmountable. know others don’t?

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* eerily similar. keep thinking it. according recent article, quotes Uri Shalit, bioinformatician Israel Institute Technology: ""There many breakthrough infections dominate hospitalized patients actually vaccinated...”

... remember we're talking Israeli data, since they're forefront vaccine rollout. Epidemiologists looking data see trends may emerge US elsewhere. ~~old~~ people like Kesha? Many people left kids behind. 35. Way lower expected, too, since getting vaccine entered lottery front-row seats. Hesitancy, obstinancy, outweighing fandom. Officially 5 new local cases. Masks longer required outdoors, they're still mandated indoors. measles twice contagious Delta. difference vaccine. make tickets 20 bucks, come vaccination card get vaccination right there. you. dude would save thousands lives bet. Ran bought Amazon branded one online. YMMV depending live ordered 5pm evening paid $2 8am. worked well, got results day shipping back. provide next day air shipping label testing center. Give two weeks. Exactly. plenty instances people charged crimes victim's wishes without cooperation. Particularly cases domestic violence child abuse happens blatant enough evidence convict even without victim's testimony. getting vaccinated effect. Although stupidity works out, less them. Get vaccinated. stupid! nuts indeed. read people praying statehouse, backing vote. 

I know Oklahoma big invisible deities set public policy. new Jonestown level. Maybe Oklahoma give Florida Texas run money. lol immense hyperbole. Serious cases predominantly unvaccinated. genocidal acknowledge COVID endemic, I'm pol pot surprised see far india’s case numbers dropped cliff.. maybe virus mutated less virulent version So, much medical knowledge subject, quite long article, gist majority hospitalized Israel vaccinated, majority people vaccinated Israel, majority vaccinated elderly (who prone severe disease), skewing numbers bit make vaccines look less effective are? correct? I've heard really super reassuring person I'm worried right 71 multiple high risk conditions (Diabetes Parkinson's).  really matter effective vaccine me, I'm mainly worried Dad.

The graph posted hand look pretty solid terms protection age groups, pandemic referring? referring data right now, months ago?. waning immunity could big impact latter. former, discrepancy graph efficacy numbers article (55%)?  article posted concerning (perhaps concerning thing I've seen point regards vaccines) I'd happy incorrect. dystopian homebodies yearn 100% WFH kind people trouble me. Someone sociopath desire isolation. worry. Climate change wipe life earth including covid next 200 years. forever. sub misinformation.  Okay, August 9th 75,316 total hospitalized COVID. would mean around 10% patients vaccinated, pretty damn good considering 50% US population vaccinated (increasing 81% 65 age group, risk hospitalization). baseball stadium Tampa Bay opened treatment. used stadium mass testing, mass vaccination. it’s used expensive treatment. 

With need boosters millions soon (Tampa Bay alone around million people vaccinated), even able get boosters time? mean, don’t think grocery store Walmart handle many fast. can't count. Thirty Five. man absolute machine- I'm huge fan went show blown away. wife basically tour 50/52 weeks year, playing roughly 300 shows year.  12 ones get vaxxed. Elementary school kids can’t get vaccine. depend us.

100% agree. would send unvaccinated children harms way. Parents keep unvaccinated children home opt distance-learning. asking everyone make sacrifices betterment society, parents exempt? Yeah great question actually… either-way 78% vaccine rate good right?  Slightly related. true masks optional Dworld? got second dose Pfizer April tested positive today. I’ve mild symptoms past days already feel like I’m getting thankfully. expecting big Delta surge October. time Halloween, deaths lag thanksgiving. probably say Biden botched war brown refugees pay attention party left dead big freeze tried kill kids covid. really insensitive comment made. current medical stance long person recently contracted covid contagious for?

We non vaccinated family member coming town covid. right 10-14 day mark since first symptoms. think previously recommendation 14 days thought changed 10? idk sure. They're drawing conclusions get data 2-dose regimen. Let’s forget Cheyenne Frontier Days attendance 22,500 performance there. week long event drew 155,618 week. mask mandate, social distancing, vaccine required. mask mandate dropped independence virus declared LONG known 100% certainty everyone paying attention US would situation point summer. 

And iIt literally CDC's job paying attention.

So yes, lie, deliberate lie too. protect best abide another country states rules, contribute another state/countries covid cases want travel. wait unvaccinated people get vaccinated get back normal never able go anywhere again. cant wait forever selfish people change. add point: get enough exposure, matter vaccinated. vaccinated get small exposure relatively short time, likely fine (as long body responds vaccine way should). However, sitting room, length time, multiple infected people without mask, still overwhelm immune system. hopefully keep dying, still lot ""damage"" (literal figurative).  stomachache! Along unpleasant side effects like fever chills, surprised started feeling like I’d eaten much candy Halloween. least we’re protected (well, halfway me!) Nope. assertion basis reality. Last year, populations NYC Chicago GREW. Nice try, tho. Finally someone speaking makes sense. Guess die would hold off? you’re immune compromised, you’re authorized booster now.  $1500 dose Fully agree measles still around still infects unvaccinated people every year. We've even outbreaks US due west coast antivax yuppies. difference measles vaccine amazing. Two shots baby set life. Hospitalizations Hawaii new high, active mask mandate 486 days, extremely high compliance one highest vaccination rates world. Seriously, anyone figured what's wrong rabbid anti-maskers yet.

Is lizard brain fight flight response? What's going on? Texas: case study elect Old people like Kesha? Sorry, Sorry. Oof. Sorry hear that. I'm getting booster couple days. I'm almost 5 months. figure good time immunocompromised people people procrastinated like crazy people getting shots right now. assloads unfilled appointments every pharmacy here, extra doses get tossed trash anyway. I'm using different pharmacy saying 1st shot. years seeing terrible shit Texas, that's pretty scary. way get approved data determines benefits getting vaccinated outweigh risk infection. mean every 100k kids getting vaxxed 5 need hospitalized (I'm giving numbers random) rather 100k getting infected 2 hospitalized, would get vaccinated? ""Eventually come states North"". here. spreading. hospitalizations deaths skyrocketing us got vaccinated. increase winter outdoor events possible? Sure. ever like hellhole American South now? Highly highly unlikely. 

And again, data Gibraltar accurate, article actively misrepresented give false impression actually happening. Kids lives outside school. Cases likely spread even free time. Everyone debating whether masks easiest, lowest cost/risk, efficient. 
Lulz. Reddit bureaucrats technical experts.

I get saying. Good you. Wait 35? 35,000? that’s either way lower way higher would expected. felt kinda crappy second shot nothing I'm willing stay safe keep family safe. I'm believer vaccine. one vaccinated house got covid (7 person household ability social distance.) pushed brother stop anti vaxxer get it. saw worked bad virus could be. he's seen aunt lucky enough completely asymptomatic thought nothing worried about. Source cram it. seems like New Zealand ""beaten"" COVID.

They've accomplished making difficult enter country. means little tourism, mandatory lock downs infections occur, hotel quarantines arrivals. Vaccines reason NZ well.

It possible countries requires basically small island nation afford economic hit. Australia tried balance it, limited success lately.  Thank u 💜  400 million dollars none would even know exist!

I'd living like total hermit nice plot land somewhere. Kiddo asthma. Got vaccinated problem. 

Can’t get vaccine allergic certain ingredients another vaccine recently guess next question percentage hospitalizations vaxxed people vs unvaxxed people. compare proportionately? sure, others blame Abott ilk, Texas increasingly purple enough slight shift big impact one lied to, data pre-Delta era.

Incorrect, deliberate lie.

1. perpetuated many months well known happened India (where many symptomatic breakthroughs already April).

2. AZ actually PCR tested Phase III showed little protection infection. RNA vaccines really scored symptoms. reduce transmission inferred retrospective studies real life data never close 100%

3. antibodies wane fast already known March. Pfizer never open it, Moderna put multiple studies clearly showing it. 

4. multiple countries worst waves got high levels vaccination -- Chile, Bahrain, Seychelles, Maldives, Mongolia, etc. 

So summarize:

1. known vaccines sterilizing real-life data first principles (mucosal IgA vs. systemic IgG immunity, former induced IM injections)

2. April 2021 latest known main difference vaccine high initial nAb titers are, decline trajectory

3. early May 2021 latest, effects P681R context B.1.617.2 understood, situation India fully unfolded biblical disaster proportions, known point summer, US would situation right now.

Note CDC removed restriction LONG current administration declared independence virus. 

So yes, lied to, deliberately. addition others said unreasonable expectations vaccine efficacy-- people know *really* freaking parents send kids back school. I'm parent yeah, kid unvaccinated I'd probably worried single, childless person. federal government paying Regeneron cost state receive it. However, one biggest political donors apparently Citiadel, hedge fund company, holds $15.9 million Regeneron stock, CEO Citadel given $10 million I've read DeSantis' campaigns.  CEO also apparently building home near Mar-a-Lago (Trump's home), member club.  So, sounds like people take Regeneron, stock goes up, benefits Citadel, benefits DeSantis donations.  politics usual. parties it., wish transparency front instead investigators figure see going on.  looks like DeSantis fighting anyone wants reduce infections increase usage Regeneron. deal Tampa Bay. told us morning news aren’t enough ambulances carry people hospitals run people anyway. 

As people casually call ambulance... caught virus vaxxed (Pfizer, 2 shots) 2 months, may need sooner think required get flu shot every year anything society? No? yes 6 month booster (because that's often get rate) pretty enslaving. That's 110 boosters 25 plan live till 80 current technology alone assuming Covid ends Endemic vaccine resistant variants like Lambda variant. Pretty bleak something touted magic bullet 6 months ago. weren’t explicitly told would assume given vast majority cases right Yeah, true. people sorta need hospitalization decide stay home. they'll remember Biden administration failing them.

Make will. happen. That’s long winded statement boils you’re antivax. move Joking! joking serious... joking! Let’s honest tho: won’t anyone working McDonald’s everyone living entirety lives home anyway. effect wipe entire sector service economy. school district MN seems taking approach yell loudly enough COVID doesn’t exist COVID slink shame. districts mandating masks get watch real time masks work. seasonal!! Oh 30 deaths. Im sure must suffering badly US lol. found interesting, thank you.  building office space. offices use, space longer needed. leave building let everyone work home, local businesses benefit foot traffic driven employees suffer. whole thing domino impacts overall economy.

Furthermore, there's actually pretty serious legal concerns regarding WFH-related injuries employee's home office generally considered extension employer's office space. matter someone work home, make sure actually space equipment safely way open injury claims resulting months working couch kitchen table. Anything have, provide, means computers, chairs, monitors, desks, etc.. 

A lot stuff kind getting swept rug right covid higher priority, stuff absolutely going become part overall conversation. seriously think average person downvoting zero knowledge WFH actually mean employer's perspective. burning question too. see someone else said got Moderna yesterday 2 Pfizer. beneficial getting 3 Pfizer? can't imagine vaccines interchangeable, trying b cell memory 3rd shot, happen third different one? Middle income countries like Vietnam, Thailand etc would love doses. Heck even countries like Japan Australia could really use them. I'm sure follow numbers.

34,000 people died flu 2018 versus 375,000 people dead COVID 2020 country can't continue 60%-ish vaccinated, vaccination rate go up. can't continue booster shots one part population 40% unvaccinated keeps pandemic going, endless loop year ago states basically smuggle PPE healthcare workers. It’s insane also seems par course timeline. ^(these masks respirators. primary purpose prevent *you* spreading droplets cough sneeze. little prevent inhaling particles air tight slightest. whole point mask mandate ensure enough people wear mask prevent spread.) Yeah parents normally terrified flu, quite lot kids even take flu vaccine.  Delta variant ridiculously infectious, twice contagious original strain Wuhan. probably combination Delta's infectiousness, country opening up, waning immunity first people vaccinated. Still hoping able travel Portugal end October. Still hoping possible safe country least 80% fully vaccinated can't done safely we'll cancel even means getting back money. may using even home computers rather company ones...

I'd wary company can't pivot savings supply office space appropriate computer. least, reimburse purchase. heck, see remote work means addressing climate change, covid. it? numbers? care situation. we’re fucks give willfully unvaccinated. primary concern autoimmune disease's live US, life feel normal see family UK still idea be. Agreed. It’s funny watching argument go “oh kids fine. It’s couple months” “yeah, kids need socialization, it’s one lost year” “do kids really need socialization?”  Hospitals Alabama full. People without COVID dying COVID. TX, Fl, LA, MS aren’t far behind. try positive outlook, unfortunately think hill die on. Quite literally. “a-ha” moment them.  Cases going down? next 8 months think going better variants? Chances will, many past 8 months? Whatever name original vaccine approved EUA, although companies working variant specific formulas. Apparently somehow original formula effective variants concern inject  shouldn’t matter mRNA vaccine get since function way. Dude use work already got fired way lol Same. got J&amp;J back March, medically can’t get one going forward (I found weeks ago blood clotting disorder). Fair enough.

That said, this, would absolutely necessary everyone “STFH.”  Masking (in limited situations) would likely enough drive Rt&lt;1, *and* given efficacy severe disease, would threat hospital system. miracle low. thought would least thousands, tens thousands. 2,854,838 people died last year long spend morning one. Oh care 2,854,800 them? Moderna since early Feb - I'm ready day 1. wedding October *2022*, family (hopefully) flying US abroad. 

It sounds silly worry something far off, am. last two years I'll never take international travel granted again. Interesting- riding ‘covid forever’ train reading comment.  safe get 3 shots short period time? seems like lot, 2nd shot got pretty sick day. 

Certainly beats respirator. kind wonder implications getting many injections 6 months  Yeah exactly. far tell data measuring things 6 months 8 months feels little arbitrary. addition said, would also guess since bulk people US got shot mid spring, trying give kids chance get fall early winter large group people try get boosters. building one dependent employer current lease. started 7yr lease pandemic saving money there. Maybe future. would argue they'll save nominal amount electricity water bills.

I 100% believe working home jobs standard though. signed expensive 7yr lease first place!  Thousands kids getting still idea long term effects them. Kids suffer parents idiots shitty graph even ask insurance (health department another county), may apply everyone. know LAUSD requiring weekly testing students teachers regardless vac status, too. baseline testing couple weeks school started Monday. YSK right debacle approving dementia drug, FDA said wanted 4-6 months data COVID vaccine children rather 2 months gathered adults. prompted [the American Academy Pediatrics send letter telling needed speed things quotes article since know behind “What concerned us hasn’t seemed level urgency authorizing vaccine younger kids adults,” Dr. Lee Savio Beers, president group, told me. Everyone believes F.D.A. prudent evaluating vaccine safety. point, much institutional risk aversion risk “Our experts really actually feel comfortable current size trial two-month review period,” said Beers. makes sense; Dr. Ashish Jha, dean Brown University School Public Health, told he’s scoured literature hasn’t found example vaccine whose side effects take two months show problem F.D.A. won’t blamed avoidable Covid cases way would blamed unexpected vaccine side effects. institutional incentives therefore point toward excessive wariness. F.D.A. does, said Jha, “mitigate downside risk drugs vaccines. almost never asked consider downsides delay.” time, said, “that approach works, except you’re global pandemic.”

So make mistake, vaccine could approved time kids get least first shot time school started, bureaucrats got egg face. Un-paywalled: healthcare workers!  


This right call sure. Same. got trial Long time ago I’m you, hence preventing symptomatic infection right hospitalization death me. Hope get info long covid post breakthrough soon. That's thought. got positive test 6 days ago stay distanced house. wondering long keep especially since I've already tested negative focusing mandates.  People talk loud want act smart, right? Similar story. Attended outdoor, vaxxed-only birthday party week half ago. town stayed friends. gave someone (vaxxed) ride home party, 2 days later tested positive covid. 3 4 people car got covid one person, including myself.

We’re vaxxed symptoms mild. One us got little nose congestion. two slightly elevated temps (mid/high-99s), nose stuff, headaches, cough/chest congestion, overall still pretty mild.

I take immunosuppressants autoimmune disease super fucking thankful vaccine given body stronger defense this. year preceding vaccination terrifying. I’m hoping doc chimes in. I’m severely immune compromised medication. I’m sure hold booster.  Good Garth. jumped gun bringing concerts back, understand why, right move entire industry. Good!!  I'm fairly sure people access vaccine point honest. 78% vaccinated still hospitalization issues? 3rd grade classmate huge fan Garth Brooks. Said role model. Sweet girl. much country, 20 years later, checks out. Thanks Garth. district, support masks, small parent (or ""parent"", half folks even kids found out) group that's anti mask even optional masks (before anyone knew Delta, we'd full mandates etc even vaccinated) teachers kid ""deserves needs"" see teacher's face. 

When heard comment, like, ""fuck that"". Even pandemic, might sometimes toss mask flu season, (just like folks lived Asian countries years ago concept never weird Covid). one ""needs deserves"" access face. (We clear masks populations do, like deaf etc, that's talking about.)."
