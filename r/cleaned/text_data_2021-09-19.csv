0,2021-09-19,"  Lmao black comedian don’t feel stronger gonna help fight Covid point. Sure many people could better job taking care overall (myself included), think starting vaccine help strong-ness speak of. Yep! actually needed goat, Katniss, find anywhere. hoping replacement trying job. It’s pretty good. Revealed accidental racism dismissively smug. recorded happening. 

Source? 

I denying happening, even is, sounds like small, small concern. know plenty people unvaccinated, get sick go work, get tested, follow health guidelines. problem? I’m aware unity systems work helps, that’s regular flu cold, I’d actually ask say 650,000 plus Americans died millions around world, die government least. Last heard one really getting charged Regeneron. info may well date. much meltdown, little time keep up. That's playing live. antivaxxers conspiracy theory leanings come Covid treatment protocol. They're coaching take Ivermectin rush straight regional infusion center monoclonal antibody treatment, call mobile IV medi-spa service come house administer fluid vitamin ""Covid cocktail"" IV treatment. means say avoid hospital hospitals giving Covid patients toxic ineffective drugs killing ventilators. lot pull home reinforces opinions. time family member calls ambulance panic, they've deteriorated point there's lot hospital except put bipap hope miracle. almost end dying ventilator, also reinforces conspiracy hospitals killing people. absolutely nuts.   rest world kind counting guys continuing get right solid model follow. 

Thank Denmark, always, pragmatism pastries.  random trials big enough measure effectiveness hospitalization death high level confidence.

quote [NEJM (emphasis studies emerging fundamental sources information vaccine effectiveness outside controlled environment randomized trials, used generate **evidence effectiveness outcomes underpowered trials, hospitalization intensive care unit (ICU) admission**, narrow subgroups. No, missing point.


I'm saying this: simply unvaccinated makes murderer. willing vector. two necessarily same, conflated currently overwhelmingly overlapping terms population.
There's one solution problem vaccinate prevent backlog hospital systems.

The manslaughter comes unvaccinated wear badge honor willingly go infect people. recorded happening. symptomatic pretend want admit they're sick. inevitably get sick (not some), take hospital resources.

That I'm trying address. living vector willingly problem, case highly correlated unvaccinated. Sometimes things happen can't helped, like everything right (got vaccinated) still got sick. That's fine. difference willingly hurting people actions try reap rewards working hospital system.


It ballooned scale longer allow happen. triaged back. Covid19 already killed 670,000

I wonder, many people set poor lifestyle (obesity, lack exercise, etc).  said gonna end badly 2-3 weeks sure. 

Cases literally fell. possibly claim prediction borne reality? preschooler got “a student teacher child’s class tested positive” email today. 

I know isn’t huge deal people we’ve pretty locked really first brush COVID. Wife vaccinated, two kids young. 

Feeling bit scared / anxiousand positive words would welcome! bust Vengaboys. get saying. think mean direct impact decision. Meaning vaccinated person covid may better chance survival unvaxxed person covid (let's say patients 25) vaccinated person case received car. another scenario may unvaccinated 30 y/o covid 65 y/o vaccinated person heart attack. 30 y/o better chance survival, get bed. Wow need doctor note then? in, take time cold symptoms 'just case' unpaid. one point also one highest rates country. also one democratic states? CDC's report last week vaccine effectiveness demographic data hospitalizations ( ) , scroll table

The Vaxxed hospitalized average 15 years older unvaxxed , higher rates diabetes heart disease Glad managed reference *Pootie Tang* article, even quoting Rock personally know someone lottery. Dude really, really lucky (it huge windfall, set modestly life paid house, gave modest yearly ""salary"" able pay friend, kid's, student loans). still buy one lottery ticket year. Serious- go pharmacy end night. think it’s 5 vial. don’t see 5 arms day toss extras. say want 3rd. Anyone immune compromised already got 3rd. parts America there’s shortage sick pay? People tend switch total cases deaths weekly daily per capita cases deaths want state country look good.   dominant strain passed chances mutate. 
Once strain gone another arise. 

The unvaccinated...the bigger pool mutations someone got JJ vaccine…I wholeheartedly agree need info  \*laughs public school teacher* loser. Serious question horses. get worms? food eat? Like tapeworms? current health director position since June 2020, first COVID wave even peaked. making sense Sounds like utopia, don’t know people aren’t moving California. One biggest Chiro schools, world, located there. right know I'm sorry going this. want place hope best you. understand pfizer full random trial boosters , seems like kind tested antibodies instead tracking cases / hospitalizations / &amp; deaths like first trial 

It would make case lot stronger right? fda approves I’ll go it, I’m going ama, Moderna end don’t really care get Covid anymore. all’s going get eventually. received third Moderna vaccine end August, soon immunocompromised people eligible area (I take immunosuppressant medications). I'm pretty sure gave full dose. nurse asked I'd symptoms previous vaccines said expect third one. I'll take original, recommended age, can't figure something better Delta (or Mu, Rho Pi — whatever turns dangerous). 

But first attempt failed mean impossible make Delta vaccine. mean, I'm tech often takes multiple tries get things right. I'm still guessing updated versions, like get annual flu.  relate issue workers’ rights?  willingly unvaccinated vast majority people taking space hospital system. want address. hubris killing innocent people.

Wait, confused. saying willingly unvaccinated killing people? Would charged manslaughter even COVID-19? …what   Well, I’ll disagree seatbelt one.. there’s plenty idiots belief “if don’t wear seatbelt, it’s gets hurt! what’s problem?”

Maybe (hopefully) sensible party doesn’t need see someone else’s brain matter smearing windscreen, random bystander assaulted amputated limb travelling Mach 5 know number people even lied (with Pfizer), pharmacies happy it. Ah. Gotcha. Sorry that. Two three metastudies showed high likelihood postive effect epidemic. certain one pulled study part data metastudies longer, ever was. frightening part vaccines immunity seem last long time.

No, that's case, frightening ability annual boosters. long-term outlook pretty grim respiratory virus, positive return normal life

Countries vaccinated returned normal life. rest us enough unvaccinated caught COVID, enough vaccines warrant booster shots. Also sick pay mandated Ireland stay home get paid? cant afford miss work. Wide open, sure, CALOSHA rules, employees still wear masks along safety rules reducing transmission. find two-faced arguments disgusting, global vaccine equity valuable important issue straight trashing science make boosters sound bad dumb harmful. mention betrayal trust public. forgot vaccination card second shot gave new one. didn’t even fill personal information, vaccination record part, inclined could put anyone’s info (I didn’t course). scale. Like said, influenza nearly problematic. mean problem, nowhere near league COVID. Influenza endemic occurs yearly kill spread rate COVID does, especially Delta. flu's ratios across board less lethal less contagious COVID...

The situation literally evolved.
For asymptomatic, cannot tell sick charged. I'm sure ask fairly obvious charge asymptomatic person, sake clarity I'll answer it.
Those willingly endanger others knowing symptomatic charged. minimum significant fine scales amount earn. would therefore charging manslaughter, least punishing instead letting hurt others freely.

Like say, willingly unvaccinated vast majority people taking space hospital system. want address. hubris killing innocent people.
I talking vaccinated dying COVID. That's point. I'm talking sicknesses COVID dying otherwise preventable die longer resources. resources? wilful science deniers clogging system taxing max... simply unsustainable fault unvaccinated run amok, get deathly sick, suddenly change heart, take energy already limited healthcare system. simply killed alone without taxing system would gladly let them, means. unfortunately that's interconnected systems work.

Obviously vaccination would prevent cases death hospitalization indeed. That's good thing. mean victims here. true victims people mentioned: people health problems need access hospital non COVID reasons longer access morons.  would effective larger bulk got vaccinated. Anti-vax people literally ruining everything. waited zip code targeted hotspot, got line. Thanks summary. Complete morons then. go grave understanding many chosen hill die on. like 30 years ago SNL. surprising Sandler 55. Statements like worthless toxic humans. ivermectin everyone knows it. dosing correctly calculated people miscalculating. side effects would ivermectin pill form humans. horse ivermectin labelled ""Plus"" ""Gold"", additional active ingredients, think horse paste eaters know that. Yeah, really know family say made decision husbands behalf. I'm closer parents naturally one would tough discussion mother law. Thanks judgement wait father law die. Super helpful weeks hell family through. course I’m vaxxed lol natural immunity let’s fun exchange pretend forget human body works nobody (D) explicitly reminded healthy humans create antibodies response sickness. I'll look. Thanks advice! 14 days per contract signed childs school. Wait. Chappelle touring Rogan? think pharm companies giving away shots free? They're free government insurance companies paying them.  
 
If owned business gigantic entities bottomless pockets ready buy every product could make, saying want stop production? Approved Twitter blogs ??

What good source information already source contention    Many Canadians got mix, gave whatever government run facility day.

I got AZ recommended anyone got AZ get MRNA, got Pfizer next. opposed trying make I’m one spreading miss information, what’s point, haven’t told people try new drug, haven’t told people drink bleach, encouraged people get vaccinated based science support mandates many vaccines mandated. I’m fully vaccinated. you? believe coronavirus devastated 3rd world, one really talking it

this would surprise all. 

The true death toll hear years touring non-bozos difinitely different touring bozos Man, Floridian rookie numbers… me! First dose Pfizer, second dose Moderna 28 days later (I didn’t choice would wait unknown amount time match doses government messaging basically interchangeable). spouse first dose AstraZeneca second dose Moderna - case choice sticking AZ switching mRNA second dose sknce AZ hit hard messaging recommending people AZ first dose would better getting mRNA shot second dose, went route.  Great. Can't wait hear Biden keeping ""the cure"" away us. Man opinion humanity taken nose dive last 18 months. Technically incorrect. actually studies Ivermectin could potentially help covid.

Main problem studies definitive studies said opposite. it’s possible help. rather rational person taking shot waiting definitive evidence human drug works, people opting purchase version meant animals know anything concrete. Yes, Patriot Act also used target anti-vaxx extremists, white supremacist extremists, etc. sell short. short opportunity get system identify exclude extremists.    100% believe this. I'm ham radio operator remember height pandemic seeing messages missionary/ham Peruvian Ecuadorian (can't remember which) Amazon. lived village would send updates. ""Someone nearby village sick. buying supplies"". ""Several sick village. locking house"". ""Almost everyone village sick. Several dead. way get hospital"". ""It's chaos. Many dead. Everything broken down.""

Imagine simply hospitals medical care US. vents. People just...die. LOT die access even basic supportive medical care, much less antivirals, vents, blood thinners, etc.

I believe coronavirus devastated 3rd world, one really talking because...shit like happens constantly 3rd world one really cares. Osmosis Jones gonna pull one Canadians mixed vaccines like crazy. spouse first dose AstraZeneca second dose Moderna. first dose Pfizer second dose Moderna. 
About half people know mixes like these. Lmao comment doesn’t sound v covid-conscious  interesting. mom still citizen Germany born. sounds like comes lot caveats see. would like move one day though sick.  wonder lead reduction virus genetic diversity around world. Delta outpaces eliminates variants, possibly done something good. Easier manage one major variant dozens way. LAUSD great. Masks tests. Immune compromised, one asked prove anything. didn’t even ask immune suppressant I’m taking. Probably anyone could get it.  upvoted?! clear. studies say well, others worse Delta (at benefits)

More studies needed. meanwhile, looks like Delta eating wherever two compete  think delta result antigenic drift.

The evolution sars-cov-2 antigenic; vaccines still highly effective infection - likely 95%+ third shot. Evolution far purely increase contagiousness spread faster (presumably within human body, since believed every VOC evolved within single immunocompromised host). honestly don’t know it’s half dose full dose, I’ve third Moderna shot (I qualified immune suppressant meds). symptomatic second one, shorter time. Covid going endmic months (in countries). idea whether endemic years. look cdc database using birthday. anyway around that? vaccination rate University Georgia isn’t high compared non- southern schools. counties vax rate GA 30.2% 65 yrs old fucking low 49%. county 50 miles UGA. Ask speak virus's manager. Maybe show it. Go somewhere don’t know you. Tell haven’t vaccinated all, don’t insurance. They’ll give shot issue new vaccine card—as far know, it’s vaccine card. carry new card around you. Fair enough, end game? Surely agree covid going endemic. case, right time schools open fully? 

I fully vaccinated, curious perspective point I'm really sure else (assuming masks vaccinations part approach).

Edit: **just asking** looks like ends. implying public health measures. fact vehemently support them. vaccinated amazing 5G reception wherever go!

Few weeks later went camping trip friend became symptomatic there, sure contagious day way up… also drove 4 hours home tested positive next day.

Thought delta variant much close space time together way didn’t catch it.

So self quarantined couple days got tested nada. Got tested week later sure nothing.

Vaccines work. 6 us trip one person ended testing positive… also J&amp;J booster. mild case. anecdotal feel booster saved me, planning getting 2nd Moderna shot another booster another months figuring I’d spread immunity (this medical advice decisions). 

My friend got sick one vaccinated. people think they’re young healthy worries well he. 29 shredded. Yeah didn’t die got fucked up, missed burning man goes almost every year, missed work, lost stamina mentally took toll, depression still feels “slow”. surf together still can’t even paddle covid incredible shape. 

He paid price.  Typical Americans blaming black women Damn, great play. bad it? agree point. wanted offer (anecdotal treated fact) view that. working community mental health center feb 2020, got something viral. annoyingly sick nothing write home about. reasons think likely Covid fine, quite people lost taste smell, importantly older/comorbid coworkers ended hospital dropped O2 levels multiple times docs essentially said viral don’t know is, you’ll wait out. part type work population likely sick whole host reasons get sick often working left. There’s also HUGE comfort anxiety trick people used beginning saying oh already Covid don’t afraid that’s used vaccine. Youre right… except one thing…

You honestly research respect understand every death covid, despite age, underlining circumstances, basically factor moot take away virus. 

The lack vaccines masks understanding viruses work coupled politically religiously alining beliefs looking good. simplify saying said, undermines totality it. 

That equal joe rogan taking Monoclonal antibodies, ivermectin, transfusions, drips equating recovering them. fact one thing. 

Quoting deaths 80 fine cause true doesn’t detract *471,472 HUMAN LIVES LOST* AGE 80. doesn’t change redirect. It, fact doubles it. lives? dont count? 187k lives 80. 471k 80. [Which number question….what’s happened previous variants…what’s science behind aren’t still circulating?  people died Covid older already working world course comfortable with, makes feel better, booster shot worse second. symptoms different time
Instead symptoms starting next day like before, started almost immediately gone next day. fatigue weird, felt almost like mind-body disconnect vs bodily fatigue. Nothing severe scary. new feling. moment nausea woke next morning. Passed less 5 min. course sore arm.   Thanks. think concern leaving dresser fan something blow particles around. Maybe that’s crazy. don’t know stuff works, even 18 months it. went public school brilliant.  less time live host, less chance mutate. one asked specific questions got booster. I’m pretty sure anyone could get one. see argument, idea getting everyone vaccinated go back spreading virus others *still* wearing face masks properly social-distancing properly bad idea.

You want stop virus here? YES - get vaccinated! also START wearing face masks properly start actually social-distancing (ie: staying pluck away) others change.

THEN virus beaten hopefully die out.

I LOVE downvoters get offended everytime say this. They're ones pull face masks nose chin, wear completely loose around face. also people think perfectly okay safe go within 10 centimeters someone ""only second"" pass them.

They also believe virus linger air potentially hours infect others.

(Good you, downvoters! L E G E N .) Delta animal reservoirs

Even did, that's guarantee it'll antigenic drift time around. 

I considered this. think delta *as result* antigenic drift. Thank well thought response. response third party trying figure myself.  states northeast less guy say getting vaccinated sticking whatever have. want get this.  argued someone months ago person made great point.  never able vaccinate pandemic.  always count natural immunity.  could made shorter. changed mindset thought like that. Thanks. wife expressed concern don’t know enough confident. I’d rather ask freak everybody house. Happy safe shorts Yeah, that's choice I'm willing recognize, ability choice meaningful, appears nil.

The really fucked thing 2021 chaos species makes ethically responsible choices either impossible meaningless. time, ethical thing there's upside, ethical thing *because* ethical. one seeking martyrdom here, finding ""right"" view remains challenging. know people actually done that. Go it. I've skeptic Sputnik vaccine ever since Russian government pretty much bypassed initial testing. case, horse paste. get point

I certainly do. refreshing, guess. like many others, I'm worn out. hope family members see light. Pucket, im going...who's coming consumption productivity, something whiney ass businesses getting. got little unemployment much loss lives everywhere. mean 1:500 lost, that's Dr three decent size hospital. teachers school, students... fucked point worth listening anti-vaxxers say. point we're done carrots, moving sticks. wantonly ignorant pathogens seeing millions infections within matter months going mutate, science continuous process rather discrete start end. going depend comes conversation kid.

""was billy sniffling last time saw him? janey? Mrs Krabappel?""

and

""who missing class last time class? much time spend them?"" Etc.  sure hope right problem viral vector vaccines like J&amp;J immune system may respond vector build immunity may potentially neutralize booster? think people happy situation way. protests lock downs often come across anti vaccination. 

I sure anti vaxx people COVID skeptics mixed in. I’ve seriously wondering thing. thinning herd followers way beneficial them? Anyone logical explanation? It’s head in! 

Also, RIP every last person passed, regardless politics choices. one victim. might go pharmacy shopping decide take booster (I got Pfizer spring) seeing local pharmacy works primary care provider said provider given vaccination records clinic administered doses. Pour ‘tussin it! 

Srsly though, hope he’s ok! thing mixing vaccines Canada successful. allowed us vaccinate population extremely fast results fantastic. Take look city Winnipeg 80% eligible population fully vaccinated vaccine passports required many indoor businesses. We've fully opened keeping masks required test positivity rate around 1.4%. Hospitalization dropping ICU patients covid unvaccinated.

Quite frankly care optics anti vaxxers. always find something use argument vaccines opinion worthless. Almost everyone know recieved Pfizer shot first Moderna second working great us! 30 years ago SNL. surprising Keanu Reeves 57. He, started off, saying, ""Guess, what?!"" I'm glad here. Please safe stay healthy.  Much luck yours. Glad vaxxed. breakthrough case, Pfizer vaxxed. respiratory issues all. Kicked mfers butt 5 days. You’re gonna kill it, literally! 🤘 Wait till learn jack Nicholson 84!!! Could running issues immunity vector affecting booster efficacy? kind annoying. know someone worked treatment. might saved someone's mother know mother got covid said instantly request treatment. got fine now. vaccines coming took virus serious. glad knew treatment request everyone knew it. better bet ass mom dad gets covid tell get treatment too. fully vaccinated taking chances them. everything right still do. catch virus better get best treatment. variants mutations happen real time. Delta variant mutate time overtake delta, like delta overtook alpha way, alpha overtook original virus.

This virus used 100% original strain what's likely bat animal. Viruses evolve. I’m Pfizer vaxxed mother law Pfizer vaxxed got gave 10 minute convo kitchen, hand beverage, didn’t even hug all. Delta don’t care vaccine. vaccine save life doesn’t stop transmission  scientists say certain future variants dethrone Delta latter ceiling infection virus could turn. really hard vaccine immune variant surge, cells continue recognize virus. Thank you, appreciate hearing … intellectually know risk low. also know (unfortunately) get easier inevitably keeps happening. Glad guys ok one bad! qualified health professionals. health insurance companies even pay them, least US. Since said physiotherapy physical therapy, I'm going guess US. takes 4 year postgraduate degree become chiropractor.

""Prospective chiropractors required Doctor Chiropractic (D.C.) degree—a postgraduate professional degree typically takes 4 years complete. 2017, 15 Doctor Chiropractic programs 18 campuses accredited Council Chiropractic that's total 8 years university education.

My local physical therapy office refers people local chiropractor vice versa. Yep, way wording politics behind everything done figured vaccine roll would done similar manner. certainly left enough pathways ""explain"" choice happens.

It's cruel world :(

The reason take good care body addition health protocols. tell, people seem happy this. Feels like Australia gone crazy past months you’re saying feel unsafe someone class symptoms? Well yeah 650,000+ deaths completely preventable disease, want think preventative measure used combat actually good. pro-vax, pro common sense.

Well, guess both. get point  perhaps tried inject somehow /s live New Orleans. We're good, power good while. Problem virus filling ICU beds patients. 2% death easily go 10% doctors can't manage flow. learn live without hospital care?  nobody's ever going catch Delta twice highly effective vaccine Delta long world. easy say ""Delta endemic forever"" there's nothing science support opinion one way other. Delta animal reservoirs, immunity reinfection appears strong least medium term, Delta antigenic drift time around. thing got going really, really contagious. closer measles flu, since somewhere two really can't judge one way other.

But there's way many unknowns here. idea immunity either vaccination infection degrades years, much less decades. idea severity reinfections would compare initial infections (6% CFR UK) vaccinated infections (2% CFR UK). idea whether gives level immunity taking “awesome mankind love” approach shipping vaccines Worst things pandamic pandamic getting worst aka new strain immune vaccine emerges. yet happen, thanks delta strain. delta remains reigning champ, shall see endemic next year. not, fked area. There’s lot research happening conspiracy theories getting traction recent years, pretty interesting. make dilettantes’ guess, I’d bet we’re witnessing emergence American culture-bound syndrome. want, cookie? be. would want another 6-12 months start large double blind clinical study results peer reviewed take chance that.

Of course, millions people already Astrazeneca Pfizer mix, J&amp;J shot topped mRNA problems. Mr Peepers:)! May ask live Democratic area lousiana? sorry may happened family. Please safe hope rebuild. Sometimes best individual conflict best entire population. article vaccine availability vaccinating people monthly case anyone confused post title Variants spread become contagious. alpha delta took off, likely though guaranteed happen again. 

There likely worse variant around corner. new virus. mutate rapidly early stages infecting new species they're adapting shedding mutations beneficial prior species infected.  vaccines shelf life used time, might Paris 55 million people die year average. Assuming half 15 million died 2020 half 2021, would mean 14% deaths caused covid. Covid first cause death 2020 2021 worldwide, far. That's optimistic even me. 

It looks like hybrid immunity best, getting vaccinated first best. Reinfections rare concerning. put box! Made laugh hard. yah, man hoping shot 3 might it.  level response produces \*really\* high.  Finally good news crappy state walk gi doc seen day get colonoscopy day after. doc orders mri don’t wait 2 weeks spot.

As American, blows mind. mean, realize that's supposed work, even good health insurance takes couple weeks see specialist unless urgent. Want psych care? Months-long waiting list. total joke.    picked last year covid. Gunshot head would effectively ""cure"" Covid infection, but...the side effects bit rough. alma mater 98% lol. David Spade 57 want another shock.  Assuming 40% population age 14 would considered idiots .40 [assumed idiot distro] × .80 [US pop distro 15+] × 330M [US pop]= 105.6M idiots. 

105.6M idiots lot factor talking highly contagious covid strain.

I forget rest point. want Mr Bones Wild Ride quick youtube search people self medicating shows absolutely one using sort measurement, one person putting much spoon could fit, another squeezing tube mouth...  reported cases someone contracted covid booster shot? yea fewer people dying. need take Florida approach want real estate open back July, need lie. didn’t provide anything beyond asked, went CVS received J&amp;J asked shot (it said online Moderna there) asked first second Moderna dose. said “first”, shot arm, done.

I would note never saw claim come insurance, J&amp;J (which covered). idea that’ll end getting posted cost passed future date.  reason don’t put seat belts hospital beds people car accidents. collected 18 states March August suggest Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine reduces risk hospitalized COVID-19 91% first four months receiving second dose. Beyond 120 days, however, vaccine efficacy drops 77%. 
Meanwhile, Moderna's vaccine 93% effective reducing short-term risk COVID-19 hospitalization remained 92% effective 120 days. 
Overall, 54% fully vaccinated Americans immunized Pfizer shot.  know, weren’t even talking masks social distancing. focusing vaccine apparent use comment mine. which, person family gotten covid, vaccinated person’s symptoms less severe unvaccinated family. 

To say different way, yet similar comment mine. focusing apparent use seatbelt car crash. aren’t focusing safety, design, inspection car itself. focusing rules road drivers follow. focusing seatbelt it’s main use. yes, seatbelt uses besides making likely survive car crash weren’t wearing seatbelt; like making sure don’t fly head first windshield rag doll around crash. 

There time place talk things seatbelt car crash. isn’t time place really. different comment thread post, sure maybe, comment me, doesn’t warrant things put front centered. good point would fully agree. MU would like word you, we'll see grows popularity though.  hundreds thousands people point gotten reinfected. people get infected never develop antibodies according recent studies.  Yeah far variants lol they've getting worse worse. stop trying rush everybody meat grinder. anti vax anti mask groups pushing hard, Alex Jones Joe Rogan used claiming successful, millions people believe that. 

There's enough grey area online support anyone goes looking positive things too, whole lot negative stories could people self prescribing self dosing it. 

I'm honestly sure myself, seems neurotoxin, forms base drug ""Avermectin"" used pest control agents... tend think safe use unless perscribed.

*I bot, action performed automatically.

Darwin lot lifting work.  got vaccines, lower chance die, what? Many people wanted vaccines return normal life think happening soon.

Keep mind vaxxed ppl also 8x less likely contract COVID, feels unnecessarily “doomy.” Also, immunity doesn’t wane quickly variant-specific boosters still possible. mention, syringe size small microchip put begin with.  idiots thought ""we it"". Plenty people warned variants explained likely might become worse. happened publicly tracked around world. People seem think...sure, here!  replied reply regarding similarities differences people taking booster shot ""off script"" vs ivermectin. 

So replying yourself, guess. never brought up.

This narrative, supported facts. Vaccines extremely effective preventing infection - 95% wildtype mRNA, 90-95% alpha, 88% Delta per UK numbers, maybe bit lower months. reduction mortality breakthrough Delta cases much harder measure since takes vastly larger sample, still significant extremely so. CFR over-50s [in 6% unvaccinated, 2% vaccinated - good reduction, still far &lt;&lt;1% flu oldest 1/3 population.

Of course, two effects stack, protection hospitalization/death always going higher protection infection.

Picture it, January 2021

One Sunday night, felt like sinus infection brewing. problem, I'll take Benadryl get ready ride out. 

Monday afternoon, painting bedroom, smell paint. said ""hmm, ain't right"". Told ol' lady said "" that's strange smell it, hope positive"". Later evening, taste gone. could taste sweet salty. Sour, spicy bitter gone. 

Tuesday morning, took Covid test. Later night, results came back positive. That's ""oh sh*t!"". Reality kicked in.

Tuesday- Saturday, fever followed chills back fever. Sweating teeth chattering. Body aches headache, sore throat &amp; inflammation cough. tired.

By Sunday, thought faintly smelled Vicks rub sure. hours, happened again. said ""I think smell coming back""

Over next days, taste smell gradually started return normal. fever chills stopped But, beat, felt like mule kicked me. took another 2 weeks recover.

After that, took another covid test negative. 

So far, seems like long term damage 🤞🏿. Everything back normal. 

I think hardest part worrying ol' lady. got sick bc dumbazz. 

So, that's problem taking vaccine. Ain't nothing like peace mind. attitude right many vaccinated people still contracting COVID. They're believing message espousing, going back pre-pandemic behavior sufficiently low enough transmission environment so.  
 
No, vaccine reducing chance hospitalized disease. least much *reducing* transmission. Get vaccinated, **and wear mask socially distance** cases area low enough warrant taking off. Protect yourself. vaccine ""I'm done pandemic"" pass.

R0 something like 18 (i.e., average infected person spreads 18 others population prior immunity).

Measles emerged 10th 11th century, likely zoonotic infection (like COVID) mutated disease called rinderpest found cattle (like COVID similar certain viruses found bats). probably went rapid period mutation, producing different variants like COVID-19 has. Eventually, became optimally adapted spreading humans, certain common mutations occurring.

It changed much since mutations make less contagious otherwise spread less. Basically, already serious mutations. scientific research shown ways measles could mutate evade vaccines would require several mutations occur simultaneously unlikely happen especially spread suppressed widespread vaccination.  people trying shit last year half.

Israel large chunks population unvaccinated still uninfected. That's pandemic problem, endemic one - endemic situation begins enough people exposed first time.

Once enough vaccine doses (50-100 days reach reasonable level worldwide vaccination) here's need measures vaccination. countries prior infection need much higher level vaccination prevent spread.

The endgame going vary greatly country. China closed borders 70% population fully vaccinated simply suppress test tracing. Bhutan (pop 750k) 95% adult population heterologous vaccination porous borders, case nearly month. 

Denmark 74% full population fully vaccinated (plus amount immunity infection) falling cases fully reopening. believe Delta could remain endemic Denmark, point reproductive rate going rise there. would cause that? even reached point boosters yet, know makes vaccine far effective second dose. situation similar Spain Portugal - high vaccination rates quickly falling cases. true many (not all) states India, though course nearly infection - they're vaccinating people prior infection, know gives dramatically high level immunity.

Countries without prior infection immunity going much harder. need high level vaccination end fast positive exponential growth, need vaccinations fairly evenly spread (heterogeneous) clumps population virus freely spread. what's seen Israel (where clumps antivax religious groups) entirely differently UK (where they've vaccinated nearly nobody 18) - countries least prior infection groups.

But long unmitigated spread would cause hospital collapse country, pandemic/epidemic there. Many countries still far point - though again, we're months surplus vaccines available.    elderly risk, mean losing ton ""life years"". might want google ""lost life years covid"":

He stark protester Covid vaccine. wouldn’t surprise vaccinate put confidentiality place could keep anti-vax image.

12 year old = 30ug


Seems like option getting numbers (10ug dose) making available public. Fwiw, daughter started wearing masks months hit 2.

But ya frustration real. enough adults took vaccine it'd enough protect children. bad happen. see Harvard came May.

This known since least ~May *2020*.

That said, overall point *for immunocompetent people*, even major health conditions increase covid risk, vaccines still highly effective. can't even calculate efficacy death college age group deaths.

I think vaccinations required, though. Masks be, too, cases high (but forever). 18 years yeah fair enough thought kill switch supposed flipped 2021-09-18. According German conspiracy groups. Except Black Death killed 60% Europe’s population. There’s question deadly COVID. theory flawed many reasons that’s relevant one. 

Go /r/askhistorians ask Covid would deadlier. It’s completely insane question ask, answer still resounding “no.”  subtitle article: “The data must reviewed F.D.A. children inoculated.”

***Data reviewed***. also conflict interest perform clinical trials vaccines they’re creating?

Bottom line kids little risk getting sick covid. Vaccinations may help reduce spread far important adults get vaccinated.

But maybe that's mean? Instead objective headlines lie.

So, don’t want go potentially expose (more like definitely expose given state affairs here) don’t to.

I’d prefer keep family protection. trials announced 6 months ago, Moderna Pfizer said trials designed use immunobridging correlates protection infer efficacy, would *not* use comparison positive cases treatment placebo arms. well understood FDA come surprise anyone. 


I'm aware that, I'm sure Pfizer/Moderna eager get approved.

Sorry misinterpreted saying! shouldn’t reddit sleep deprived... Thank you! think reason people take issue slightly increase risk catching/spreading it. risk low there. masks help, 100%. think critically. tiny Covid Particle gets sneezed someone wearing mask, comes wearing type covering. chance hits cloth, doesnt enter body. also chance passes right cloth/surgical mask. vaccinated another level protection even infecting body come contact. really bother wear seemingly protect unvaccinated want risk entering someones body mutating next variant may vaccine resistant? Thats thinking understand it. worry, covid sure believe them.  rocks.

Great rebuttal.  Yes! Dr Poland makes point well talks. highly recommend them. guess better question is: rate vaxxed hospital going beyond would expect number demographics vaccinated? (because know higher risk people sought vax more, make greater percentage, still expect bit worse average vaxxed person). Also: excess breakthrough, due waning immunity due evasive variants? then, course, experts weigh risk benefits, even far risks vax small. small uptick excess vaxxed hospitalization may justify boosters everyone.   
‘Team vaccine’ follow accept science too. Even complicated, subtle, reassuring would like. going breakthrough infections need scientific handle understand that. want govt agencies stick science hand vaccines treatments willy nilly, weigh risk/benefit properly.    
I’m betting ‘extra’ breakthrough cases, any, people like immune compromised way. group included original studies, add us mix, bang, get ‘unexpected’ breakthroughs.  expect   
‘Ordinary’ people without severely immune compromising situations probably well protected don’t need clamor shots may help improve chances anyways.      might methods would achieve better hospitalization rates less risk, like getting everyone vaccinated (less spread, though zero, darnit), masking whenever feasible awhile, or…?    
But, speculation stranger internet, people talk doctors check info experts. I’d interested see stats mentioned I’d like see public education around expected normal help people calm advocate right next moves. need thoughtful this, knee-jerk.

Oh yeah, brief scare would get blood clots.

Agreed Pfizer/Moderna likely significant, small portion country third option JJ shot nobody wants talk about. really empathize family members set get JJ shot, telling same, inferior option almost everyone else know able get Moderna/Pfizer.

I'm vaccine mandate. thank Exactly! 40 hours per week masked next X years seriously big deal means won’t die. hard people understand? first thing think sounds like COVID, get tested, may really know sure. Secondly, (and congrats mild symptoms), get vaccinated likely robust protection pretty much forms SARS-COVID, including variants. Third, still get infection, symptomatic asymptomatic, spread others--particularly Delta variant. Fourth, natural immunity provides protection, may end getting infected rare, may go well next time. probably fine, see risk really nail protection others getting free vaccine. mild case mean get again. Yes, healthy young person probability serious disease huge, probability survival much higher 95% you, still much bigger probability meaningful side effects vaccine, that's health authorities analyzed data millions millions people recommend it.

For personally, choice pretty much 1 1000 chance serious outcome get corona, 1 500000 chance serious side effects vaccine. vaccine still helps transmission.

This process we’ve gone adults kids 12. process worked well far. 

After FDA verified safety efficacy vaccines, billions people age 12 vaccinated COVID worldwide. vaccines safe effective. 

Let’s see FDA says kids 12 under. common virus vaccine.

The issue analysis assuming everybody get covid think ""1% covid cases children require hospitalization"" counting total cases, confirmed cases.

Also clickbait af realise covid long term side effects thing? Also kids spread covid kids parents, etc too. cannot handle stress worry more. fucking worrying kid interactions kids. fucking sucks. what's reason someone shoes get shot

If catch virus reduces chance significant damage body/death lot. Even Alpha repeat cases record. Remember, mostly dealing Delta now. chances still zero. life risk guess. still consider fact reduces chances catching spreading lot well. two fold. Youll less likely even get it, even get symptoms lot easier deal with. reason people get mad since chances get unvaccinated higher, chances spreading also higher. become better nation tolerating assholes. COVID vaccines US need dual approval FDA CDC Advisory Committee?

I thought FDA enough power issue EUA. CDC also need approve it?  parents think virus risky less risky vaccine?

The difference is, getting vaccine choice getting virus possibility, certainty. even virus dangerous, would really suck get vaccine getting serious side effects. could avoided that. logic I've heard, entirely unreasonable. 

For record, reasoning getting vaccine overall (significantly) lower risk, we're never getting rid covid I'd rather protected. make feel better wearing masks, we’ve always required also wear face shield top masks. Govt even thinking putting air purifiers people’s necks. Every time go establishment sign form take ur temp. insane end inside almost 2 yrs vaccinate kids flu. one year old two school aged children, we’re you.

Hang there. mean could waited, sure. risk like said takes time vaccinate longer people remain unvaxxed bigger risk. thing is, lot people waited that's...bad. even still refuse get lifeboats. That's big part problem, reason say vaccinated even slowly. time saw people, ocean, lifeboats. expected people would get lifeboats available initial wave, expected might even shortages first wave boats came prioritized risk, elderly, bad swimmers wait insane. actually enough boats point.

But boats second stage general public crazy think might also limited supply boats available. know there'd fuck ton anti life boaters preferred sharks boats would fact plenty boats. yeah always going take months get everyone boat would exacerbate timeline cause even longer suggesting people wait?

Also, nobody forced take JJ - encouraged take whatever available nobody actually forced. recommendation time based science was: good preventing death, vaccines good it, take any. delta true. even still, people WANTED wait go get different one, that's choice could made. wanted wait fancier boat risk sharks, choice had. advice good advice get could know might available might waited months right one. like getting info moderna might better advice anyone unvaxxed still, get vaxxed. town Pfizer, get Pfizer, wait til god knows next moderna shipment danger now.

The thing is, might well plenty people get vaccine instead waiting angry bet also saved number people's lives might never realize it. like maybe right rickety boat row shore mad bunch people got nicer boats realize stayed water another day shark eat you. never know.

Like said think JJ people need included helped right now. awful they're neglecting 14 million people. imagine there's lacking information causing delay think there's enough evidence countries show could probably give everyone JJ booster Pfizer moderna it'd fine fact even discussing frustrating understand feel angry it. hell think giving kids vaccine shown cause adverse reactions number deaths safe?

There's probably cases really bad covid kids reach clinical definition, know often results long covid cases kids that's another concern.

The direct impact virus still lower, zero much concerning risk bit transient myocarditis.  understand need vaccinate 5-12 year olds when:
- case fatality rate age group really small , around 0.01%.
- transmission still happening around levels non vaccinated people.

Not juvenile deciding wear mask.

I addressed everything posited first comment. Assuming every kid 100% chance catch covid, 1/10th assumed would 0.01% 0.19% chance kid hospitalized covid. would somewhere 2.5x 50x risk hospitalization vs risk myocarditis (assuming 1/25,000 chance). Again, assuming every kid 100% chance catching covid. USA! USA! USA! 

Chant y'all Asking real question. Ok kid them.

Dining restaurant whilst midst pandemic essentially saying I'm ok exposed Covid. I'm fine that. 

However

If 4 month child immunocompromised ok exposed Covid complete ignoramus. fuck? question really seen answered. 


If fully vaccinated breakthrough infection - infectious be? know many Delta oriented studies this?  seem remember one, small made assumption fully vaccinated \*might\* deactivate virus quicker rate, thus short infectious period well likely less infectious overall. really. higher concentration places. pedantic, landlocked Laos export seafood.

But rate articles mention exact location Laos, according bats found Oudomxay Province, directly borders southwest China. Quite possible similar populations border. currently myocarditis Pfizer vaccine.  Oh, may take while, things typically come back. Crossing state lines necessarily protect crime committed another state, especially violent crimes. Selective Pressure - concept say three shapes wild - triangle, square, circle. vaccine developed mid 2020 effective preventing squares circles infecting host, yet nearly effective novel triangles emerged late 2020. Triangles thrive, spread among vaccinated well, quickly become dominant variant. call breakthrough cases. no, *random* taken across millions individuals millions infections unique circumstance many mutations across those.  Eventually selective pressure forces unsuccessful variants dominant variants selected for, largely due vaccination natural herd immunity. 

 ""Virulence"" matters define - virulent Pfizer/Moderna vaccines, AZ etc., natural antibodies, unvaxxed? three? permutation each? Variants different virulence these, need table define it. 100% know certainty Delta leads many breakthrough cases among vaccinated variants, makes virulent vaccinated, unvaccinated, may natural immunity due contracting Sars-CoV2 building antibodies. Variants emerge become dominant *because* resist herd immunity, way around. like animal populations exploding food source no/few natural predators, another predator (e.g. natural/vaccine immunity) killed food-competition yet interest/efficacy them.

Myocarditis also caused viral illness drug reactions. substantially higher incidence rate COVID positive population vaccinated population. cases vaccinated individuals (of 1000) tend mild resolve without treatment. religion get influence public health?

Well, sake question, think religions see religion supreme guideset overrides everything else. suppose would control public health well.

Not necessarily see good thing, many religions include various crappy old guidelines blindly following harmful.

If want something like religion, think philosophy better choice. allows us define values guidelines life, still flexible open criticism. would (maybe) take one kids.

Great test worked. environment. Death pretty serious. think this, you’re digging heels hard you’ve decided even though vaccine well researched thoroughly tested kids dying ok long pretend side right. It’s disgusting ashamed.  ""If every pathogen"" 


Not every pathogen creates pandemic. 


"" might little self-defeating people see evidence vaccines effective."" 


People don' want get vaccinated use excuse. consideration.  


It could well third dose many months exactly need complete vaccination course, considered ""booster."" know many months. question - wait, attempt get ahead virus?  FDA kind said ""why both?""  certainly interesting see happens data available coming months. Wrong! It’s masking distancing. need indefinite masking, distancing reduced capacity! Selective Pressure - concept say three shapes wild - triangle, square, circle. vaccine developed mid 2020 effective preventing squares circles infecting host, yet nearly effective novel triangles emerged late 2020. Triangles thrive, spread among vaccinated well, quickly become dominant variant. call breakthrough cases. no, *random* taken across millions individuals millions infections unique -- eventually selective pressure forces unsuccessful variants dominant variants selected for. 

 ""Virulence"" matters define - virulent Pfizer/Moderna vaccines, AZ etc., natural antibodies, unvaxxed? three? permutation each? Variants different virulence these, need table define it. 100% know certainty Delta leads many breakthrough cases variants, makes virulent vaccinated, unvaccinated, may natural immunity due contracting Sars-CoV2 building antibodies. Variants emerge survive *because* resist herd immunity, way around.

Here's Columbia immunologist Vincent Racaniello explaining lay terms: Ope, again, ~.16% healthy people catch COVID die it. So, yes effect result in, it’s definitely serious enough mandate adolescents take it. 

Also, one long term effect hope vaccine immunity COVID, there’s one. simply cannot say “probably none” regard vaccine long term effects. 

But clearly talking circles wasting other’s time. I’m gonna log off. would like say one final thing.

I hope family stay healthy. truly hope vaccines show years 100% safe. Odds aren’t, don’t know treatments perfect risk benefit ratio. 

Have wonderful day! ended cutting really good friend mine last year kept insisting covid flu. kept insisting 90 year olds dying matter. especially annoyed one dads coworkers also friends died covid August age 56. keep hearing covid kill people truly annoyed me.

It would send terrible message overrule outright, given massive swathe population approve (including people allegedly concerned long right job), Fauci probably Marks seem wanted everyone, we're probably looking *extremely* broad final recommendation.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*    Sure using drug non medical situation. Ivermectin prescribed doctor seem causing mass hospitalizations. approved treat COVID, drug approved use. still ongoing study see it’s efficacy treating disease. overarching bashing drug stop.. especially drug approved humans period time. hand waving approved drug advocating non approved booster suspect.  ""barely"" still far myocarditis does. 

In fact looking myocarditis alone, covid 6x likely cause young males. one issue alone vaccine better, nevermind potential harms covid.

You'd crazy look papers long covid damage they're finding think vaccines higher risk.  really annoying difference opinion particular group scientists seen ""not listening science"".

First, FDA science. research is. FDA wrong, people. Now, absolutely respected high authority science. absolutely default position. However, group scientists blindly followed. reason people try say average person understand science without merely listening scientists. people read research papers, ones often go strong biases searching one line confirms hypothesis instead several reject it. However, average person understand science mean average people can't legitimate complaints groups scientists say.

Second, FDA science particular individual, science best suit population. two differ distinction matters, particularly discussing EUA whether individual people allowed take action. read interesting comment talked war situation 80% troops killed air attacks 20% land. advice would hear government would minimizing losses air attacks, somewhere unreachable air, would stupid follow advice instead figuring protect land attack. similar situation FDA's advice focused majority population people situations considered FDA follow science actually follow advice tailored situation.

The last time saw much ""why people listening science"" complaints telling people bother wearing masks Delta approaching. people say wrong, way wasn't. time, Delta hit yet, brief window risk wearing mask pretty low. community, benefits wearing mask small, compared ""risks"" annoying. wore mask time. ""as bad antivaxxer""? No, simply recognized individual situation, mind wearing mask much mind infection COVID, meant communal science done fit individual risk profile. I'd rather extra protection, still recognized science done valid.

Third, different situation hydroxychloroquine ivermectin issues little evidence positive effects. Boosters, hand, massive amount evidence positive effects panel deny that. case, issue question positive effects, rather question negative effects potentially causing benefits smaller risks. case positive effects, positive situation, however, case positive effects also risks, someone already risky situation might different individual risk profile.

Fourth, committee publicly announced ignoring benefit boosters - spread. degree epidemiology, one math. something growing exponentially, cutting growth factor mere 4% easily cut result quarter. such, quite mathematically possible boosters openly encouraged 40% population took them, decreased spread 10%, could drastically cut cases, hospitalizations, deaths quarter. issue spread vaccinated people spreading people lives unable get vaccinated. However, FDA openly announced considering hospitalizations deaths. likely two reasons: spread hard quantify, supposed looking communal effects, rather whether boosters benefit individual taking them. such, someone living person immunocompromised might different individual risk profile beyond FDA considering. point complaining people ""aren't following science,"" aware potential limitations science discussed.

Fifth, FDA bunch humans, humans biased. Normally, issue, scientists try hard unbiased aware many biases found clever ways randomized placebo controlled trials. However, case, two scientists openly stated strong biases boosters bad due world wide communal view. FDA supposed solely investigate whether benefits would outweigh risks individual. that? I'm honestly sure. two scientists writing journal article Lancet done worst possible things could done, caused appearance bias. court law, would recuse themselves, yet not. Honestly, fine resigning Biden promising boosters, okay either politics science. However, article made clear two view ends justify means, position incongruent science seek truth even ends suit you. glad two resigning FDA, yet hand vote yesterday opened question many scientists panel also view ends justify means. Damn. Really messed up.   Man covid could far worse serious negative impact livestock.
The world prepare next pandemic. might  challenging.

You know bet someone said similar plague Spanish flu. said got Pfizer originally. getting Pfizer third shot well?  think getting close ceiling 18+ vaccines. Maybe little 80% first doses seem going again.   might something vaccinations actually effective. Like polio one everyone screams example.  possibility harmful side effects that. contrast, 3rd shot tested preliminary safety, presents additional risk 2nd.   think lot unvaccinated people take new antiviral drugs covid. lot start listening doctors actually get infected hospitalized. course all. well honest, UK cases still around 30K day.. better 60k cases day that's still great   largely concluded Ivermectin effective treatment covid.  also need take higher dosage approved FDA.  Ivermectin approved use humans, specific cases. approved treatment covid.  


Booster shots approved immunocompromised FDA panel voted unanimously approve pfizer booster nearly half population. They'll end anti vax anti condom. could seen coming?   want *medical data* want value judgements low effectiveness drop getting booster public policy perspective factoring various non-medical considerations? 

All 'yOuR FoLlOwInG ScIeNcE' people forgetting medical data much dropped, whether boosters improve that, whether they're safe science, judgement call low effectiveness drop authorizing not. Peter Marks doesn’t vote (since member) advisory committee. watched minutes whole thing see hear type voting (though obvious would voted yes could annoyed outcome). miss something vote interpreted vote? referring half dose moderna supposedly developing specifically booster. Different third shot advising immunocompromised. also question means

Well, first order need vaccines approved kids. main reason still lockdown mode, risk kids close highest since start pandemic due Delta.


I also know many people (even small social circle) breakthrough infections even lasting symptoms like loss smell taste, despite vaccinated Pfizer.


But, point, anyone wants vaccinated be, fully expect us fully drop precautions like distancing masking, going back normal. that's okay. Keep mind adamantly oppose vaccine coming from. opposition emanates basic survival instinct attitude savor life. Trust lacking deep seated aspect psyche difficult reason with. psychological term best describes ""comforting delusion."" aren’t. 70.2% eligible residents fully vaccinated 12th highest state. people stop making shit careful. handed vaccine card filled third forth line... pharmacist told eligible booster sent away without third shot.

My father law chose selfish die anti vax hill. husband reserve right selfish keep family safe. I’ve mom use “excuse” behalf octogenarian mom, another elderly family member visiting town wanted face face quarantine period. like “uhhh tell you’ve exposed isolate 2 weeks, duh” - gonna do, say “oh don’t care come infect me?” Highly unlikely. delay obtaining Pfizer PM personal connection ??

There stories federal gov ignored Pfizer approached make deal. 

I understand media regularly reminding Australians facts. mess poor leadership people died.  Biden admin tried FDA turned down. Lord works mysterious ways!   Remember how, beginning, Trump parody twitter account actually pretty funny? time tell satire reality?  Glad found right thing. vaguely relate experience. Double drop LSD 14 hour trip turned exactly mind melting panic majority it. Must've hell. Case rate irrelevant statistic.

Case rate relevant statistic. matters relevant. whole reason pandemic first place bad illness going around one thing matters, here. *just* death rate, hospitalization rate, rate spread, average length case. it. variables bad enough combined create situation in. know, virtual tours make shit load money. Im thoroughbred horse breeder stores tough time stocking ivermectin, however named dewormers exact percentage ivermectin. need search names. idiots dumb buy ones lol. folks protesting horse passports. think studied yet, people it. I’ve thought frankly don’t want get J&amp;J   So, I’ve seen story this, Center Immigration studies, aggressive anti-immigrant advocacy group. gaping hole stories news coverage based on, information crossing border services. make casual reference undocumented immigrants, 90% story people crossing legally controlled crossing, means immigration system largely decided welcome here. know coverage this, us citizens residences throughout country happen northern Mexico would likely want care US would cross way, legal permanent residences. border create differential, short changing immigration policy, don’t see federal approach would change that. actual evidence? fucking evidence there?

Just saying ""don't know could natural"" evidence jack shit.   sure mean “just flu/cold”. entered 2000 death/day threshold. par worst winter surge. 

The hope unvaccinated vulnerables change behavior 
 get vaccinated least decrease exposure. already infected resolve infection many going icu/hospital.  surely helping vaccination rates country thanks keep good work! Nah, simple them. They're looking complicated answer life turned upside last year half.

When solution arrives simple getting shot, easy. Convenient might say. easier brains invent complicated conspiracy look things face value.

The thing is, we're used lied look lies everywhere. would thousands medical researchers, vaccine producers, etc make rationales work. think they're motivated greed actively harm people vaccinations actually crazy. Legit opting reality type stuff. agree points, don’t think necessarily incompatible statement. think characteristics virus fundamentally determine wide drift range is, also absolute vaccine preventing infection (and also willing population getting said vaccine). viral strategies rely heavily mutability, others lesser degree.

Personally, think there’s substantial amount evidence suggests COVID always exist group variants, much like flu. It’s got features virus that’s gonna humanity while, argument could probably even made influenza. Mama Bear mode activated. I'm willing difficult discussion behalf husband. 

We also thought lying telling we've exposed need isolate, tough want dishonest also would love avoid said difficult conversation. FYI Vaccination skeptics/hesitant surprised. Sounds like engaged absolute Thank suggestion. Unfortunately, doubt laws would agree videographer. husbands family wearing masks social distancing want hire someone put harms way. 

I'm sorry family well. think really kind someone record service maybe get closure viewing it. Solve equilibrium.  guy you’re responding confusing Chris Rock Dave Chappelle. Mixing vaccines *could* problematic. What's described opposite, though still Altmann suspects boosting mRNA-based vaccines Pfizer Moderna – sneak mRNA containing instructions make Covid-19 spike protein cells, showing look – work well, mild concerns wisdom boosting another kind – viral vector. 
In contrast, vaccines like Oxford/AstraZeneca rely virus – case, chimpanzee adenovirus – smuggle code Covid-19 spike protein bodies. there's theoretical possibility reinfecting (inactivated) virus several times could bad idea. 
""We've never before… there's quite big chance going induce inhibitory antibodies vaccine itself, stop vaccine working,"" says Altmann, explains he's curious know whether UK's vaccine advisory committee – JCVI – taken vaccine “prevents illness” mimicking experience ingesting microorganism makes really sick developing immune memory. specifically aims preserve go whole “being really sick developing permanent injuries heart/lungs/brain” way developing immune memory. 

This set vaccines job. someone catches bug, much less likely develop severe illness. 
Also, even mutations disease now, incredible. so, fortunate vaccines come out. J&amp;J studying two shot version formula since last year. don’t think would started study didn’t think would work. mother US citizen born, probably cannot get German citizenship. would give citizenship upon gaining American citizenship.

If still German citizen born, possible. specific rules born whether parents married time. example, 1975 German fathers could pass citizenship children unless resulted stateless mother unmarried. That's bingo, can't many people left unless we're wrong many infections missing. really intelligence. stupid far epidemiology viral diseases concerned. That's listen experts fields say. I'm self centered asshole. turn 14 decide needed improvement growth person.

These people did, make excuses them. Apologize them. Positively reinforce bad behavior. pat back criticize level humanity.

You function people exact way function Covid. belief system wrapped around supporting something provides harm, feel better yourself.

Next time wane humanity, remember defended actual murderers.   I'm pretty sure that. call everyone cuckolds know love insult people exact behavior participating privately. pulled ass, huh?

Or really know difference Chris Rock Dave Chappelle?  mean easy refute? chance back ""in normal"" current vaccines vaccination rates. frightening part vaccines immunity seem last long time.

Okay got vaccines, lower chance die, what? Many people wanted vaccines return normal life think happening soon. wasn’t touring all. dude totally made touring Joe Rogan accepted fact lost respect Chris Rock haha. Reddit’s interesting sometimes.  Interesting, Source? dentist wanted floss nightly! course told could stick advice.

, health officer Sanders County, MT says forced resign local man blamed wife’s death. man accused Lawyer preventing wife receiving Ivermectin, hydroxchloroquine &amp; antibodies died due Covid (1/9).

on twitter. Occam's razor compelling Dunning-Kruger.   did. Told pharmacist doing, gave me. gotta fiiiiight right paaaaaaartyyyyy  fall even before. Roll Tide! ig reel / tiktok science math girl i'll try find it

edit official numbers .. much math remember calculated infection chance too

theres like 7600 / 211 million vaccinated deaths vs 670k / 119 million unvaccinated deaths total 

so like 1/27763 vs 1/177 maybe everyone exposed covid best case I’m spreading information it, say it’s funny people trust newer one read mentioned I’ve learned it, read don’t consider expert claim know read it, anyways I’m saying given vaccine given millions people people still don’t trust people like Trump, get like Trump sounds trying get for, 

Also Trump hasn’t pro vaccine, anti mask, even got Covid himself, started tell people get vaccine want it, led huge cult thinks delete dna many crazy conspiracies got vaccine leaving office brought one Rallies got booed tried back track. person goes ego, GOP public anti vaccine gotten well. It’s known Rand Paul gotten rumors has.

So don’t get pointing FDA approved vaccine trusted something new isn’t FDA approved is. It’s simple question I’m floating conspiracies saying anyone lying I’m asking question. fear winter surge finally break health care system. 

The healthcare system already broken. way could get worse people parking lots etc.   Vaccines system within 6 weeks max, likely way that. showing immune system pretend version COVID knows attack ASAP next time rather wait things get bad.

That's it. hard refute antivaxxers worry long term complications. work. got tired ambiguity got Pfizer top J&amp;J. Didn’t lie, either. Told pharmacist said contraindication I’d taking unknown risk. rolled sleeve. regrets. honest never considered option. used card since there's like 5 lines there. surprising. Lots people, Australia, become worst versions last two years. 
 
Thought experiment: 2019 went around asking people, ""what would happen somebody suddenly shut inside year communicated outside world social media?"", 10/10 people would say ""they'd turn nutjob!"".  
 
Then everybody went actually that, we're surprised we've got bunch nutjobs running around? Interesting. I'm reading right study delayed booster (6mo initial injection) rather initial two-shots closer together trial started late 2020.   someone dealing breakthrough case J&amp;J right sucks. symptoms noticeably less severe though unvaccinated family sick time. TIL chris rock 56?? wtf  fully approved J&amp;J, seem harmful based small scale trials.

The CDC said could mix Modena Pfizer without issue. (IIRC Canadians actually got combo default shipments went Canada). wait every elderly vulnerable person planet got 1st shot cut line? Would have, though? time period?

I feel like might covered ""excess deaths"" (or deaths beyond normal) part model. CDC FDA, us got J&amp;J still here. Apparently, data understand, much susceptible severe issues Delta variant much less protected new variant. supposed do? Please love fucking God give us fucking direction!

Q: need booster shot received Johnson Johnson vaccine?

A: likely received J&amp;J vaccine also recommended booster. expect data next weeks keep public informed.

\-Dr. trump alliance invested it, iirc trump also promoted bleach formula guy told , guy leader church course product dangerous fuck. question is: people take them? think ultimately answer is: depends message comes from.

The mAb treatment shown people get sick suddenly longer give shit “their principles”; want get better they’ll take anything offer. Hell lot ask vaccine they’re actually facing hospitalization death. Ireland proposing similar except without testing... children close contacts symptoms go daily lives. Vaccinated close contacts already follow rules. We've insanely lucky year 1 really bad air day far. Last year horrible scared year would too, far good (knock wood). definitely issue entire Bay Area concerned with. husband's school Oakland finally stocked air purifiers every classroom saying afford to, union step 🙄  Even smell taste loss occur viruses. reliable way determining COVID specifically positive test tracing contacts somebody positive test :( reason get stronger then. help immunity addition health protocols probably figured would cut profits supply second shot received shot J&amp;J, yet there’s guidance boosters J&amp;J recipients.

**Question**: need booster shot received Johnson Johnson vaccine?

**Answer**: **It likely received J&amp;J vaccine also recommended booster.** expect data next weeks keep public informed.

\-Dr. Hypocritical fuck.

As often case, nothing real problem they’re personally affected. want conscientious booster.

A text says, ""be x PM extra doses. Doses administered unvaccinated. potentially wasted, remaining doses given unvaccinated run thawed doses."" summary save click. 

It open letter signed scientists, research papers. criticized previously open letters signed another group scientists published Lancet.

In conclusion, anything, think scientists anything either. fair, since Lancet published scientist's letter, Lancet published set scientists' letter.

“Fully vaccinated people Delta variant breakthrough infections spread virus others. However, vaccinated people appear spread virus *shorter* time….

new data began emerge Delta variant infectious leading increased transmissibility compared variants, *even vaccinated individuals.*” There's quite bit shifting blame though, even though rollout looking Oct/Nov long remember - end day, get enough vaccines people want.

May well also blame Germany Canada's advice AZ - always going hard sell countries respect tell people prioritise vaccines, we're told can't afford despite (at time) virus.

Certainly anti-vax, can't conveniently blame Government failing get Pfizer vaccine Australians take Covid-19 seriously start, bother wearing face masks first long time (and even today, still bother know wear properly), bother social-distancing (and many still don't) properly.

THIS primarily people Australia let Covid-19 run rampant thousands getting infected daily areas.

Also, many Australians slow get vaccine - even available. Shouldn’t also blame ATAGI basing AstraZeneca recommendation incorrect assumption coronavirus rates wouldn’t go near future? Australia used [all available AZ rather encouraging vaccine hesitancy extremely low rates side effects associated AZ, they’d better place today. Hospitalization rate like 1/10th isn’t vaccinated? I’ll tell this, lot hospitals SD definitely feeling assumption virus mutate kill large numbers kids assumption. It’s impossible assume viruses, including coronaviruses, endemic hundreds years without mutating disease?

Also main reason kids aren’t vaccinated right mutation variant one emerged, vaccines we’re using 12 years age children could used smaller dosage kids, tested right now. thing holding approvals risk-benefit calculation harder moment COVID isn’t dangerous children. People don’t understand low risk anymore. patient actually funds insurance pay it, often working cancer kind really hard. Cancer survival rates US subpar problem. Originally wife wanted 3 4 kids. 2 won’t more. Even though could afford children don’t think it’s moral ethical bring many children world point. 

With way everything going; climate crisis, economy, politics, pandemic, etc don’t think could provide good life many children. We’ve talked adopting fostering later life right don’t want add global population.  dose makes poison alone.

I know sure many guys fine bedroom jab. Scott Gottlieb believes claim alpha. Basically almost one left completely naive covid 19 winter.

He also says expectation going way endemic. 0.2%* . négligeable. we'll teach 5x number that's 1% freed up! irony still true *because minority now*. country would accept cancer. Health issues drag immigration score down, age (most people cancer older). 

You're also position move different country sick even case.  happened Vancouver, WA 2 weeks ago. banned. everyone exposed gained natural immunity variants make merely bad flu instead 20x deadlier flu. pro move get vaccinated inevitably get breakthrough case next 3-4 years pick superior natural immunity without much risk. elite pro move get yearly flu/covid shot keep natural immunity strong.

It's going like flu everyone gets point. recall seeing study estimating time someone hits 30 years old they've got 98% chance flu. Maybe asymptomatic light realize everyone gets flu everyone going get covid point. would use ivermectin fungal skin condition? World US 50 % enough.  scientific debate unless China releases basic information -- appear intention do.

You debate what's gas mileage car, starting nothing get's nothing. Thx info bad idea. Trying ""live"" virus allow mutate potentially get much worse point starts killing huge numbers kids.

Way back March 2020 everybody listened Singapore Professor directly fought (successfully, way) last SARS outbreak. advised everyone wear masks (even showing properly applied), social-distance properly.

Did Western Media (and WHO) listen him?

Nope.  We've certainly made plenty mistakes here, perhaps we've ended good mix caution, investment risk-taking. strategy take stand, never change talking points come hell high water.  Actually it’s karma Chris Rock lying us years. used say black people Minnesota except Prince Kirby Puckett. learned anything last year, holy crap lot black people Minnesota! 

/s 

Get well Chris! doesn’t. 

Connecticut Maryland lower daily cases per 100k pop least last 60 days.  smallpox, measles, mumps, rubella, polio, diphtheria using link author. Failure part. Political shitshow... Sputnik far best adenovirus based vaccine market today (90% efficacy Delta) even though mRNA ones still beat.

Edit: lmao downvotes, Russia bad China bad amirite, USA govt #1 world covid transparency amirite. Sputnik rates confirmed Lancet chucklefucks even rabies vaccine, time you’re hospital you’re far past point vaccine anything. stop trusting doctors figured whole leeching thing working well?

Discovering piece information wrong advances science maybe right does.

Still, Pfizer better first months, Moderna AZ better long term. foreseen that.

I think mass vaccinations bought us time figure residual risk everyone Delta without high death toll. sad lady. Covid indiscriminately hurt many people, her. anti-vaxers people wearing masks carried responsibility decisions.  pandemic recognized public health concern, instead crazy political scheme… know. true infection rate according CDC 4 times higher official one. We're around 40 milliion official cases, probably 160 million total cases US alone. 

Then got vaccinated people, maybe close 200 million gotten vaccines far. Theres overlap hopefully end year people antibodies. 

But knows, maybe strain resistant antibodies come Delta gone. Dang that's socialized medicine...I thought opposed that. No, that’s vaccines work. idea help immune system recognize virus clear multiplies control. time you’re hospital, it’s already multiplied control, immune system already well aware virus looks like. idea searching every author checked significant publication history, much quite relevant.

Richard H. Ebright: Decroly: Achaz: Casane: Canard: on. Check omeros’s drug  Shutup Walken, 56. think Rupert Murdoch responsible persuading particular attackers. ONE thread watched video? Ivermectin also prescribed doctor know, like antibiotics.

Im anti Vax (had 2 shots Pfizer), looking avenues Covid-19. one care celebrities think. seems Latinos general willing get vaccine. Look South American vaccine uptakes example, it’s impressive given supply. Watch video closely, please. No, realize certain race color exclude ignorant. Youre one generalizing making assumptions picturing. black irrelevant, think antivaxxers ignorant. think almost anyone thread pointing 3 women look like ""typical Texas rednecks"" getting comment deleted. I’m gonna take horse old town racist I’m gonna take ivermectin Im different corticosteroid maintenance, guidelines released people qualified corticosteroid greater equal 20mg prednisone 14 days time. Im different one max 14 days time high enough go 2 mg day cause hypothalamic - pituitary - adrenal axis apparently? sounds scary, try go full 14 days time unless really need it. sure qualifies me, Id gladly sign consent form get booster knowing shitty immune system proven past. Hardly anyone thread seems watched video. heard ""Texans"" went usual stereotype. Doubt, means vaccine resistant strain would take hold subsequent article says 3 women proof vaccination, men either cards called question possible fakes. yeah, back got said Pfizer best AZ. basically trust shit say anymore.

""Get first available you""

\*gets AZ\*

""Don't get AstraZeneca""

""Get Pfizer, best antibody count""

\*Gets Pfizer\*

""oooooo, actually Moderna better""

Whatever, feel protected even care anymore lol families chiropractor wouldn’t even touch moms neck took X-rays palpation. Found bone Spurs 10 years got surgery needed. (It c3-c5). 

Just throwing aren’t quacks. neck adjustments unpleasant aren’t fully relaxing. Go good chiropractor first. realize called 3 Black women ignorant. Ten bucks says know Black women picturing typical ""rednecks."" case, think 3 Black women proof vaccination...it guys whose vaccine cards called question. altercation ensued there. I'm sure fact Kenyans ingesting horse paste helps one claimed vaccine 100% effective preventing COVID. Still, much much less likely require hospitalization get disease getting vaccinated.

I don’t understand people stop first point that’s it. “OH STILL GET COVID GET VACCINE? WELL NEVER MIND.”  watch video, heard word ""Texan"" went stereotype. nr 3 = number 3 = booster (3rd dose) help: Thank goodness chiropractor isn’t quack told pros outweigh cons. know isn’t medical doctor it’s nice hear someone tries best use natural medicines work medical doctors. Alabama btw. Getting second shot coming week 👍 Delta may killing younger people, versions covid seemed target elderly past productive years. 

However long covid could serious economic impacts long term. tens millions people working age earth long term health consequences covid going cause lot issues.  Missed it. Looked rest it’s same. Nobody who’s opinion carries enough weight garner attention evidence. excess death rate India alone 5 million  Fascinating work.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* I’m really sorry. :(  brand shot.  Stay safe. Best luck you. think didn’t ever bad, got bad desperate demagogue wanted whine politically victimize himself. Alongside Covid-19 pandemic began misinformation pandemic. 

What (very much could been) neutral shared human crisis collective efforts overcome it, became politically charged “matter personal opinion.” Politics never part it. meant experiencing COVID. Sorry! prescription horse paste! Well maybe. good idea effectiveness shot 2 declines, especially given 21 days shot 1. know declines shot 2 3 months after, certainly know trajectory shot 3 is. confusing population growth general extremely high birth rates resulting skyrocketing population growth overabundance children. They're thing. Welcome internet, comments become true they’re upvoted/retweeted true figure many reasons that. inlaws good people, prone drinking far right Christian koolaid. Yep  experience school district parents FB group many many parents complaining last year kids need masks sitting six feet apart. Saying six feet works, don’t need masks. Didn’t matter many times someone replied say works. I’m surprised can’t appreciate nuance vaccination. transfer Covid-19 back middle ages, would deadly black plague (claimed ~25M). 

Some considerations bringing covid middle ages:

-population density less rural areas existed. 

-most places open ventilation due lack a/c, crowded indoor gathering places, lack electricity. 

-how long would take method transmittance discovered people catch on

-with assumed ""less educated"" population time (though medical opinions I've heard fellow man seem middle ages understanding level), stubborn willing would people take recommended precautions. 

-no treatments available middle ages person gets covid.  

**Would black plague deadly 2021 Covid today??**

-Assumes vaccine yet exist (duh), ability use current mRNA methods available us (if used way tell bodies make black plague antibodies). 

-assumes equal amount disinformation available percentage people willing unsafe. (Though admittedly black plague physical evidence much convincing ""real"" non-believers. harmless flu previous years point. Thanks sharing. I’m happy recovered! didnt know TY!   virus still around causing deaths due vax rates.

Well, that's really true. Last week 800 people died covid UK. manageable, suppose, everyone starting accept (like flu deaths), virus harmless Europe. Forgot died first world icus full couldn’t geht treatment heart disease strokes. small numbers compared starve economy collapsed, dead vaccinations third world stopped, aids prevention network collapsed there, etc etc. ""impulse"" Israeli term booster context? People acting like vaccines super rare, super complicated, highly reactive drug can’t mixed matched. case we’d fucked.

Exactly. also work stimulating immune system pretending disease. happens immune system gets several different views disease? gets better fighting it. expect anyone modify behavior me, rest, care back me, although it'd best everyone. doubt vast majority vaccinated none issues experience unless group extremely bad luck, statistically unlikely. 6 people circle got virus (all breakthrough cases), young, healthy vaccinated, 1 got degree would say mild (just tiredness, sneezing that's it), others endured miserable week. people know got infected last year (pretty big sample 30-40 people) handful almost symptoms, rest (who office workers 20s-30s) got absolutely wrecked even got ICU, luckily none died (but vaccine).

As question, things stayed like I'd cut ny hangouts significantly getting others sick. admit recently thought differently, hanged much thought last, anyone else vaccinated got it, would big deal sneezes, pandemic us pretty much over, still super nasty, people house complete flip flop perspective (I'm anti vax, really, vaccine provide protection this, shocked breakthrough massive infection happen much milder). care random strangers get it, collective care myself. 

The reason happen practice I'm getting immunization last roughly year. hang normally can't carry virus get anyone sick. year better vaccines treatment methods, immunity runs may average experience indeed mild. case would keep hanging knowing risk low, even got again. virus keeps mutitating eluding treatments, symptoms still bad, I'd go back cut hangouts happens. can't otherwise experiencing this, chance catching worth extra fun me. They've approved 65 medically endangered folks. delay obtaining Pfizer PM personal connection ??

I'm highly skeptical this. Australia strong incentive go AZ similar large drug manufacturer CSL could produce locally bulk.

At end day, nobody (except NDAs) really knows went vaccine negotiations, whole lot speculation filled void. okay. least vaccinated makes symptoms lot easier deal with. use analogy? perfect! Contingent. continent. offensive claim doctors nurses hospitals deliberately withholding effective care deliberately administering harmful treatments Covid patients. trust Facebook ""medical experts"" internet virtual consult doctors give prescriptions ""human grade"" Ivermectin Z-paks, also trust sketchy IV spas send nurses homes administer ""Covid Cocktail"" IV infusions specific vitamins minerals. Wow. covid cases state Australia 😳 articulated well, thank Sure there’s point got live. suggesting never public events future ? 

The point lockdown slow spread vaccine. « Normal » life available vaccinated people. Otherwise « no new normal » crack pots right like CTE: long list common symptoms mean something else nothing entirely. Compound relentless news coverage surprise half self reported long covid sufferers blood shows 0 antibodies covid.

Brain fog perfect example. actually condition well defined thing, general sense sharp be, AKA purely subjective vague, hard describe impossible diagnose people online willed symptom. Probably immunosuppressed training. mention someone great shape incredible lungs.  vaxxed mother law stopped see us gave drink, chatted minutes. tells son Covid (not vaxxed) contact him. furious. 5 days later (which typical onset symptoms exposure) started feeling like hot garbage. weird killer headache pretty much knew straight away. Went got tested next morning. rapid antigen NEG. PCR positive. Almost everyone knew got delta variant tested negative rapid. Get PCR.
I nausea painful body aches. slept mostly several days, hour abs moving around good I’d go back down. fine less week symptom onset.

Regarding local elimination, point hold true something like respiratory illness? so, come countries world successfully able sustainably achieve it. Australia island completely halted international travel put place incredibly strict/draconian laws try prevent spread still found way. Countries like Israel well truly onto third shot case numbers high ever. Unless break discovery much better vaccine see become endemic worldwide like flu.

I support continued drive improve situation vaccinations (provided coercion involved) I'm sure much appetite community measures thus far used (moving universities online, lockdowns, etc) perhaps brings us back OP's original question - what's end game? look like measles/polio/flu pre-2020, look like we've last year. crackhead new Jack city. 91. must’ve around twenty something that. Makes sense. fucking amazing people know vaccines work. Even amazing point, we've through, people know vaccines work.  What? true either. vaccinated would't ""select"" dominant strain. completely random. Delta showed population zero vaccinated people India December 2020. virulent strain win matter whether vaccinated person not. happens vaccinated people less replication events. Lol people think time works? know people moving pictures don’t stay stuck there, right? vote rate Republicans though, determine who's coming fewer voters, multiply deaths percentage voters demographic.

Another thing misspoke 50% approval. isn’t vaccine effectiveness efficacy vaccine. distinction two words. measure vaccine efficacy clinical trials, needs atleast 50% approved.

Also, want combat misinformation, include sources reliable websites organization. Like this: CDC, 

“COVID-19 vaccines effective

COVID 19-vaccines effective. keep getting spreading virus causes COVID-19. Learn different COVID-19 vaccines.

COVID-19 vaccines also help keep getting seriously ill even get COVID-19.

Getting vaccinated may also protect people around you, particularly people increased risk severe illness COVID-19.”

Being seriously ill implies hospitalization. vaccine goal one single objective, multiple objectives root cause tackled once. 

It’s important people understand this. science vaccine complex average joe. Now, let’s bring seat belts. Seeing understanding seatbelts work super easy. black magic. Strap go ape, ape hit car, strap keep ape flying windshield guts meeting steering column.

Yet idiots refuse wear even today! Serious question, point would expect others modify behavior ease symptoms? Covid literally never going away matter much people want deny this. 

That's ultimately endgame describing. vast majority vaccinated people none issues. suggest rest society wear mask get sick? Stop hanging around other? Still hang around 50% capacity? I'm sorry know coming way rude I'm intending, get idea. 

At point would feel comfortable thing, year year, another person?

One reason might consider reason boosters entertained. covid back November 2020. I'm sure immune response would fade compared Pfizer (more fading) Moderna (less fading), faded could afford extra protection.

That could definitely effect, poll data saw end July predates Delta wave. perhaps absolute worst unscientific take data ever seen.

The vaccines (ALL them, effectively mRNA vaccines generate spike proteins) incontrovertibly reduces negative outcomes infection *any* strain variant SARS-CoV-2. Period. Additionally, also reduce ability sustained infections. 100% supported data across world across populations. 

It precisely decision-making anti-vaccine anti-mask individuals directly lead increased spread variant viability, providing rapid easy infection vector.

RNA virus' ALWAYS rapidly develop variants (see influenza).

You showing fundamental misunderstanding vaccines operate. vaccine, ever, virus pathogen prefects virus attempting infect. fact, every case, action learned anti-bodies via vaccines *requires* infection take place order actively fight said infection. 

The effect vaccines prime immune system fight targeted pathogen. best cases, immune system fact ready fight, pathogen attacked extremely rapidly - within hours infection.

But vaccine wholly prevent inital infection onset pathogen - ""biological force field"" prevents pathogen infecting cell - presence pathogen first required order trigger immune response destroy it.

From last month involved control—but full control—over long it’s going take. Pfizer spokesperson told company plans submit EUA application 5-to-11-year-old group “by end September,” six-month-to-5-year-old group “shortly thereafter.” “

July 2021 said results clinical trial 5-to-11-year-olds – expected September October – results 2-to-under-5 age group 6-months-to-under-2 age group could quickly follow. might begin process FDA emergency authorization ages.”

June Pfizer spokesperson said company expects data 5- 11-year-olds September would likely ask regulators emergency use authorization later month. Data children 2 5 years old could arrive soon that, said.” deleted single comment, idea talking there.

My problem 100% attacking someone pointing primary purpose vaccinations simply reducing severity illness. That's it. Sitting waiting 1 year old get vaccinated. initial date age group ""late summer"". We're far behind god damn I'm tired point.  person clearly arguing bad hesitancy put something bodies (we=the medical science community) fully understand react either short long term.

Not trying state opinion consensus (which factually isn't), said clearly wrong. huge amounts data vaccines. chance side effects absolutely miniscule that's fact too. room debates here. Furthermore implying vaccines dangerous actually are. incredibly unlikely negative side effects going appear years line.

Having said that: Yes, healthcare workers vaccinated. also true tiny minority. said beginning factually correct: vast majority doctors, experts, immunologists virologists vaccinated advocating vaccines. happening world wide. pretend people go consensus valid opinions basically 95% experts foolish unnecessary.

No go ahead downvote me, even though said id objectively correct. He's thinking terms 4-6 months boosted antibodies. play enough video games getting slaughtered son Mario Cart understand differences.   would great/sign mine up;

And point far early predict developmental consequences kinds damage covid cause. really want gamble that? (And no, there's comparable risk damage years later vaccines, that's antivaxxer myth relies magical thinking).  FDA set age limits Pfizer submitted data ages (initially 16+, 12+ later filing). 

Oddly Pfizer asked boosters 16+ submitted data 18+ boosters least one FDA committee member dinged that. Mine 2 5.

I've always suspicion used safety morphed form suppression. don’t show, they’ll warrant arrest follow around. Yeah, unlikely, know rate transmission like among animals. Great, there's going horse shortage. vaccines need prevent every infection. need *that* good.

Two things :

One, people vaccine natural immunity, we'll say ""hybrid immunity"" less likely get much less likely spread it. get exposed end getting another symptomatic infection, spread disease much, all. I'm pretty convinced due crazy good immunity Spike, least mediocre immunity N-protein. 

Two, people (with kind immunity, vaccinated/natural) continue get minor infections *and* spread virus, spread reduced rates (there evidence this), spread enough matter.  new kindergarten child. started preschool IEP social/emotional delays 3.5 February 2020. School closed covid 2 weeks later. made little progress IEP goals remote learning. went back hybrid spring still behind kindergarten going well. top added stress there's much sniffle pick school get covid test. apologize. wanted make point finding first study could showing agreement, went bed.

Many studies, like one, look one variables involved: efficacy infection, efficacy hospitalization/death HFR/CFR. generally agreement efficacy infection 80-90% (5-10x RR) efficacy hospitalization 90-95% (10-20x) RR, combined 5-10x RR (80-90% VE) pre-infection 2-4x (50-75% VE) post-infection. Looking risk reduction risk ratio, RR, intuitive multiply reductions sequence together. also important look Delta numbers, since vaccines far better Alpha every previously prevalent lineage, point efficacy hospitalization high scientific summary US data CDC: 5x RR infection, 10x (2x post-infection) hospitalization, 11x (2.2x post-infection) death. raw UK data, showing 70% reduction CFR (3.3x RR) vaccination over-50s. original UK study efficacy delta: 88% (8x RR) infection (testing positive) delta. Pick study set studies want almost certainly going range: 5-10x RR infection, 10-20x RR hospitalization/death. analysis original Pfizer trial 6 months; 86% lower bound efficacy infection (though separate Delta). numbers Israel show 90-95% efficacy severe disease.

There several caveats. antibodies continue wane people can't get boosters, efficacy pre-infection (driven antibodies) likely continue decline, post-infection efficacy remain unchanged.  really would want higher post-infection efficacy, see unchanged hospitalization risk infection risk climbs, implies post-infection efficacy actually rising time (which would *overwhelmingly* good news).

Of course, none numbers approach 95% efficacy seen pre-infection too-high-to-measure efficacy seen post-infection Alpha wildtype second doses, likely achieved (based phase 1 trials) third shot. opposite opinion here. rise vile antihuman positions politicians direct result people's ability share garbage opinions without shame choose.

Social media allows curate audience everything receives applause. People decided maybe XYZ opinion ok since easily find groups validate them.

An example someone's grandma saying racist shit dinner table. likely going get away old, family, really bothered start drama. Yet, probably going pop much public.

Social media essentially allowed people gaslight holding repugnant positions actually morally correct. I'm entirely sure put genie back bottle here. Yes effectiveness vaccines clear, it’s still frustrating high rates vaccinations aggressive outbreaks still happening. I’ll keep supporting mandates stop breakthrough cases stop mutations could make everyone’s problem again.

Masks indoor, dine restaurants absurd pandemic theater muh freedom  remember discussion partner news coming AUS, NZ, Taiwan Delta variant breaking strong quarantining. 

I sure Taiwan, AUS NZ really little natural immunity community high enough vaccination numbers cope Delta way earlier strains. spreads fast seems escape vaccines low-to-moderate symptoms.

All goodwill confidence built government sacrifices people made strictest lockdowns world could undone. Technically already that. vaccine fully FDA approved, label use kids 12 permitted. killing small percentage people. (1.6% COVID cases result death). Death part life, small percentage one live with. Roughly 90% deaths people pre-existing conditions. So, simple math, less one fifth percent healthy people catch COVID die COVID. simply serious enough vaccinate children. would argue it’s serious enough vaccinate children, ultimately parents decision. see Aren’t disease deaths considered natural causes?

It happens. I'm going second anecdotal evidence.

I've upwardly mobile life, moving middle-of-the-middle class decidedly upper-middle simply ""upper"" class lifestyle. still stressors life, know like worry basic monthly bills, like to. difference trivial.

Also, people affluent neighborhood simply healthier look better typical working/middle class person. personal trainers, good food, less stress. average 40 year old looks better average 30 year old neighborhood grew in. Sign up, shoot up.  approved 12+, lot 10 11 year olds miraculously turned 12 overnight. 

You're going bring birth certificate pharmacy. 

Personally, I'll wait approve child's age range, going weeks months. expect start see lot 3 4 year olds ""look young age"" getting shots CVS starts rolling 5 - 11. Damn Count Chocula! NEW:

--NYC Mayor says city increase COVID testing schools test students weekly

--But students quarantine less often: positive tests longer trigger full classroom quarantine. Masked, 3-feet distanced students stay class. That's CDC policy.

That's huge improvement schools area. far school year, NYC 771 partial full classroom closures due Speak yourself.

I ton parents DYING kids vaccinated fucking vacation see grandparents again. people worked beside years never feel again. ones refused damn thing protect others around them. No! reason take chance. ""Forced vaccination rape""
I'm pretty certain sexual abuse victims would find offensive protester carelessly places rape mandatory vaccination category. personally considered it! got pregnant lockdowns ended. planned pregnancy well timed one. maternity leave crunches numbers days trying figure way stay home her. grandparents didn’t provide childcare needed daycare? wouldn’t question, ass would home baby. don’t need pay daycare. genuinely enjoy job. That’s keeps workforce. complete picture though.

* Unvaxxed breeding grounds new variants

* Breakthrough cases happen, fatal, still really suck know much long covid yet (especially children)

* Immunocompromised people cannot vaxxed

* unvaxxed take hospital resources literally causing hospitals turn away patients needing treatment. People dying result

The willfully unvaxxed/antivax crowd awful, unfortunately scenario leaving Darwin also negatively impact everyone else. hubby fully vaccinated. 15 year old funny vaccinated. ""hesitant"" regarding 5 year old sure why.  We've got couple kids son's preschool 18-20 months wearing masks successfully entire half day program (other outdoor lunch). think worry two choking/strangulation hazard masks, they're adult supervision eliminates risk. university art class large classroom edge campus 9 people seem wear masks, feel perfectly safe. Meanwhile another class near center campus, building that's also connected residency hall 40 people shoved tiny classroom even teacher wears mask. university's sole pandemic response signs every campus encouraging vaccination. See there! I’ll bring deck cards really good... oh wait, that’s still illegal state. Rummy is. Fuck thank linking this. 4 year old assumed going start baby-4 trials 5-11 approved. (Why would think though, that's dumb!)

So excited get kid vaxxed.    honest question, completely trust studies? sounds like willing sacrifice public health children, totally understandable also ironical hopefully soon! black woman. :(  
I've posted story before, *this year* learned nephew's significant tubes tied during/after c-section without knowledge permission. ***22*** took reproductive rights her. (They live Alabama.)

&amp;#x200B;

Damn, I'm still furious this!! metric success shouldnt hospitalized gets recorded. people sick bed week lingering fatigue weeks months never get recorded. I'll going booster next weeks. Yes, would say trial data showed There's baby family too. rarely house short life. know hard be. Homegrown antivaxxers this, one else. 100% this!

Right every ounce wants say ""fuck em"" unfortunately kids ""unvaccinated"" category.

Once vaccinated happily say ""fuck em"".

I hope people (kids) vaccinated slows thing cannot get vaccinated least return semblance normalcy. hospital census still lower vast majority places winter. Combine fact vaccinated person, unlikely need covid.   cried reading too. grateful kid get vaccinated soon stop feeling like playing Russian roulette every time send school deep south. great news! Yeah fully vaccinated uncle currently getting 20 day stint vent long recovery. fortunately lived happen. It’s weird you’re disappointed data shows coronavirus doesn’t infect affect children severely you’d expected.    Thanks. I’m really bad reading statistics knowing actually mean. Even without vaccine, 23% even 8% entire country point hospitalized Covid seems possible.  OMG yes  think could mandatory vaccine order continue attending Public School (as many Vaccinations)? 

One part feels would ensure Parents get kids vaccinated, another part knows Parents qualms pulling child School simply avoid vaccine.   made day, even turn soon, I'll hang today. Thanks! Oh know, haha. finally screen time! wish table comparing vaccines. Delta still circulating.

So past Deltas peak? past summer peak there's winter peak come?

So shit.  NPR well Wall Street Journey others reporting Moderna holding better  Hey, cool news - one month, drop month monikers refer kiddo 2 years old ;) Exactly. time tell. Even viruses like flu regularly mutate avoid immunity, it’s total loss immunity. herd effect keeps stable level.  True, cease problem overnight. ones spread new variants. Wow, used photo 2002 article, that's little media gives shit American Samoa.   ~820 million doses till now, ~610 million first doses, ~210 million second doses. Live data [official dashboard](http://dashboard.cowin.gov.in) lot mistrust government due history medical abuses. PoC gal, call BS fellows. times concerned cautious, ain't one them. different versions vaccine different races, I'd say that's super sus that's works. there's specific facility distributing vaccines, local pharmacy it, brutalist government hospital. 

People letting fear take wheel, dying it. stupid pathetic way let racists win.   authorize instead waiting month reason letting thousands children get infected don’t  wrong link.  don’t know old news found one old Minecraft Youtubers, Bashurverse died covid past week. spent last tweets encouraging people get vaccine bad hospitalization was. relatively young guy sucks see he’s gone. Antibody levels always end point 12 studies. ""MOARE DEATHS!!!"", governor screams, ""THERE'S ENOUGH YET!!"".  born, died. moment you; took notice. would assume condition elevate risk vaccine-related myocarditis would also elevate risk Covid-related myocarditis, evidence right says virus several times dangerous vaccine. expect children would highly recommended vaccination exempted school vaccine mandates due liability issues. believe said “a weeks” 5-12 range. pediatrician ball parked end year 2 year old I’m cautiously optimistic. great news.

I never understand mindset insists *must* put hand hot stove able understand *why* put hand hot stove. speak.  


Do even understand many people harmed choice?  keep waiting day 3 kids family. Every day check news. Sounds like moved bit closer. 🎉😭🎉😭🎉😭🎉😭🎉😭🎉😭🎉 No, pointing there's political reason many ordinary folk exposed lot scary anti-vaccine information. 

I see discuss Covid without making political, made political. think matters all? choice usually two obscenely wealthy white dudes both, despite superficial differences, cater rich upper class consumes fair share. matter believe climate change hold power whatsoever. I'm sure CEOs major shareholders Chevron, ExxonMobil, Saudi Aeamco et al wealthy highly educated people believe climate change.

There's thing overpopulation, overconsumption. There's room many people live less. Dude, history world country like USA put profit human life, example Vietnam, Iraq, Afghanistan, Opiod crisis, War Drugs, profit prisons, etc??  Assuming vaccine safe effective kids, I'll board getting whatever available first. That's approached getting vaccinated adult. Assuming what's true adults holds true kids, Modern effective, even Johnson &amp; Johnson effective enough provide benefit. got Pfizer vaccine. would interesting studies outcomes families different vaccine coverage, there's difference family got one vaccine got mix. safe get. basically eliminated immediate danger. work office work there's around 6 us we're fully vaccinated. Since getting vaccinated we're normal like social distance anymore wear masks around pretty fine us. office work there's 7 people one vaccinated they're fully normal pretty much fine. office 3 cases covid recently thankfully they're mostly vaccinated everyone fine although unvaccinated coworker passed onto unvaccinated father. 

If vaccinated risk breakthrough case lower amongst unvaccinated group unlucky still catch vaccine fortunately significantly reduces chance hospitlisation/dying. I'd say meet enjoy yourself. relieved hear results good official source.

An official source, lol. mean company MAKING vaccine? fuck supposed say? ""Nah, recommend product. Let another company make billions, instead"" 

I think getting little trusty, now. I'm relieved hear that. can't wait positive research results plan roll out. girl born last year pretty strict pandemic baby. can't wait go her, feel relatively normal knowing protected. Link poll? realize recently 1918 flu less could infect KILL people within span 12 hours.  I’m pretty upset. One best friends, mother, hospital right ventilators. two collapsed lungs chest tubes kidneys failing. 35 years old unvaccinated. read please go get vaccinated right now. Think family kids happen one unlucky ones. get that. toddler go back daycare 5 days since august last year since go back classroom. us back higher exposure settings scary. We’ve exposure scares lucky. I’d love feel better sending daycare bout going places him. That's XKCD came first, world formed around it.  Preprint articles require higher degree scrutiny rigor accurately evaluate many types articles. kind discussion would appropriate strictly scientific subreddit /r/COVID19.

So like people infected wiping eye... touching face... etc..  

And others living full-blown covid patients taking huge amounts directly lungs..   There’s answer. Doctors. doesn’t one reason. hope true 😭 Vaccines don’t long term side effects finished days, sometimes weeks.

In early days either complained people using sites put black neighborhoods white people places, complained vaccines sitting unused people still outpacing supply restricted sites neighborhood residents only.

There's legitimate excuse here. poverty, access, inexcusable. They're better positioned poor whites access tend live urban areas. Poor whites also lack trusted regular doctors. unacceptable poor whites, unacceptable them.

These kind excuses send message ""It's ok, understand, can't expect people make good decisions."" soft bigotry low expectations. dont think really matters I'm honest.

They produce disperse vaccine quickly, *somewhere* going major outbreak matter time hits rest world. mostly trying slow hospitals get overwhelmed actually know people hospital covid know people actually covid hospital.

Giving kid still scary, everything parent.

Thank you! mean, live high vaxxed urban area admissions ICU (NOT cases) reported, low. know one vaxxed person got covid around mild symptoms… though friend south quite bit sicker.

The real harm we're trying prevent kids catching school, taking home killing grandparents. kid wants that. probably things go. Everyone get version COVID point. vaccinated mostly get mild illness largely immune going forward. vaccinated rougher time susceptible reinfection later. virus eventually fade background become another respiratory bug pops fall like many others. Oh yeah, wow idea.

United States ""overpopulated"", get this?

The US overpopulated decades. see fast overview nations exceed biocapacity much simple introduction concepts. Overpopulation absolutely critical issue threatens environment future.  

It question food production. impacts population area include things like excrement produce, water need survival, plants animals displaced, erosion soil depletion nutrients, loss trees forests, power needed provide electricity heating cooling, increase spread disease, vehicles people depend roads/fuel require, etc.  

It matter lived grass huts, ate nothing fruits vegetables, rode bikes. certain point, many people one space going take greater environmental toll land sustain many deer (who drive cars, clear cut forests, farm cattle) become overpopulated areas. know kids ventilator coin flip adults? thought whole point “anti-mask “protect freedom”. Shouldn’t freedom extend people choose wear masks? pure stupidity owners part matter try spin it. I'd argue detectability somewhat factor. Side effects generally noticeable develop minutes days. hidden effects developing months years later like skeptics worried about. We're confident point risks well characterized. I'm sure that's quite right. Poor people kids poor destroying climate. Birthrate decreases income.  don’t think data shows JJ “much susceptible” severe issues Delta vaccines— source that?

So yeah, you. think going lie go get Moderna shot. data UK, combined similar AZ vaccine mRNA shot, seems indicate safe effective. deal feeling shitty couple days alternative dying COVID-Delta.  depends person’s unique circumstances. unfortunate half strong enough immune system live someone yeah life sucks right you. he's literally telling get vaccinated. mean, hard core idiots probably change mind, still lot lazy people got around might motivated example. Ducking savage 🦆 Hasn’t ivermectin prescribed administered like 40 years? mean know it’s rage talk horse paste make fun people straight say data given humans disingenuous. Yeah shots proven relatively safe, FDA straight said data necessary vote nearly unanimous.  [Sounds somewhat like this. (Not Gates' part  need Google statistics many vaccinated people end hospitalized ventilators compared unvaccinated? vaccines effective reducing spread illness keeping symptoms less severe get ill. 

This isn’t binary thing. vaccine less 100% effective still beneficial. It’s principle seatbelt safer design car - won’t always work, outcomes people wrecks still much better safety devices factored in. microchip thing especially funny people also idea would even work. dog tracking chip size grain rice, absolutely nothing unless scanned vet's office. absolutely notice chip implanted skin, would sort scanning apparatus around entire country. Well South finally risen. heard another term used weeks ago describe kind thing ‘social murder’. used society makes basically impossible live racism, sexism, discrimination etc, case, failing protect us pandemic. inaction going kill effectively kill lot us.     Everyone something different, basically like super awful cold. Correct, 30mcg vs 100mcg measure active ingredient, measure active inactive ingredients. know amount (or number) mRNA each. Unfortunately that's probably reason exists. We’re getting lucky. town San Diego basically Deep South SD, one lowest vaxx rates, we’ve lucky bad time. matter time. yet? booster despite receiving shot? What's logic statement? I'm similar boat. far data AZ + mRNA Europe looking really good, internal data J&amp;J showing second dose boosts antibody levels 9-fold. I'm eagerly waiting data mix-and-match vaccine trial hoping US moves quickly allowing second dose based whichever combination effective. There’s evidence boosters work delta anyway there? I'm say fuck go get ones. lie it, check. glad got vaccinated protected possible. least happy that. like line Animal House: ""You f&amp;$ked up. trusted us."" Mild soreness got headache day two that’s easily attributable dehydration. issues JnJ shot one either though. respect Chris Rock plummeted.  “Generally, declare pandemic sustained community outbreaks different continents”

- still continents though Also: many parts US, high risk fellow citizens actively aiding virus spreading.

I wish FDA panel looked voted deny boosters millions people. I’m pretty sure that’s DOE rule school something else beyond me. kids paying price. Hope everyone recovers. understand vaccines magical virus shields? never been. Data breakthrough cases handled well, article ""School officials say 19 positive COVID cases reported - staff, linked orientation prior school starting.""

 


That happened. admin thought cool us gather grade level demanded zoom option. admins realize one super spreader close schools  experienced nothing, doctor talking to. prescribed antibody test me. full antibodies (5 months after) she. concerned, wait bit get antibody test, probably fine. went Walgreens weeks ago wouldn’t let get either mrna shots I’ve already shot J&amp;J.  messaging beyond abysmal. worst part Public Health agencies US anything complaining enough data make f------ decision anything. Nice. I’m vegan eat mostly whole foods, eat high polyphenols. :D 

Who’d thought, diet affects overall health body’s immune system. known *ages*. :\ really need better education around diet nutrition. found everyone chatted side effects one other, exhaustion second, nothing first, fair, wake 5 start work 6 may explain things unbelievably ignorant say. It’s estimated 10% unvaccinated people haven’t done yet phobias needles. That’s BIG number. It’s insane issue isn’t taken seriously someone debilitating fear shots. Virtually effective solutions provided us we’re told essentially “suck up.” phobia form mental illness, it’s fear. lack empathy matter unacceptable. get it’s difficult understand — believe me. didn’t condition, don’t think would take seriously either. herd immunity something want see, urge develop compassion people suffer trypanophobia. believe power vaccinations ability keep community healthy safe, I’m sure lots people phobia attest. something brains wired differently irrational reactions events others experience little reaction. 

That said, instead shaming people phobias, don’t work towards actual solution makes little bit easier. Bringing trained medical staff great deal patience &amp; compassion, similar ones video, great start.  Since eradication appears table, probably less ""end"" US UK's world vax + infection rates really high. really much room population immunity improve estimated 85+% folks countries antibodies. J&amp;J Garbo. Anyone got headed rite aid get mRNA shot instead. neither, I'm surprised.

The good news, though, took days — like one two — develop ""code"" mRNA vaccines genome sequence original COVID. rest time testing first mRNA vaccine, figuring mass produce first mRNA vaccine, distribute it, on.

But now, infrastructure place now, developing new mRNA vaccine targets delta ought fast easy. know develop new flu vaccines every year. People often say, ""We've never developed new vaccine quickly before. that's quite right. Every single year develop ""new"" vaccine year's new flu strains. leverage old delivery system manufacturing system. That's quickly. mRNA supposedly super fast easy plug new DNA formula create new improved vaccine. forgot Joe Rogan. watch below. tell like? set go route next week.... Oh know, we've given anyone else. I'm saying arguing excess doses given away overseas irrelevant that's happening, next best option boosters.   feel booster? took JnJ kicked butt. 104 degree fever super flu like 2 days. I’m considering booster I’m honestly scared. US health care say? Looool  considered bar herd immunity, back thought surviving virus getting vaccinated would give antibodies make ""immune."" we've lowered expectations realistic level: vaccine highly effective reducing risk hospitalization and/or death. say that? said wear seatbelt avoid serious injury death. Vaccines ~90% effective. means there’s still 10% chance get it. you’ll avoid hospitalized dying end getting it. wondering something like would helpful cause worked horses (of course). I'll read text vet tomorrow. Thanks advice! possible...... don’t understand share information something admit don’t know much cost nothing leave sentence. Like what’s goal right protect people covid repeat &lt;News said last night? 

And end comment misinformation talking Trump literally pro-vaxx since available lol there’s many GOP members anti vaxx pick one example isn’t. get upset people don’t listen say vaccines 😆 “I lied position complete ignorance people upset won’t trust me??” Nope, unfortunately happen without vaccine. get point, “smart” people spread infectious diseases kill people too. 

It’s sad “stupid”, clearly choice, means die? lacking bit humanity imo. select vector viruses initial doses common humans exact reason. Presumably booster would need use different adenovirus vector would require new manufacturing, testing, etc.  Yeah touring going skyrocket odds getting COVID. literally meeting thousands people week. I'm personally camp we're likely going riding current wave straight herd immunity, would bode well winter beyond. I'm far expert though, take appropriate grain salt Haha, stand corrected! That’s mad Why? never stop trying new things.

That's completely true. viruses commonly vaccinated except influenza actively mutating way escapes immunity. possible COVID reach sort optimal state like measles polio, also possible antigenic drift like influenza.  way could prevented....

Sigh. Mumbai, familiar Indian cities.  mix vaccines like that?  source stats? live rock want parents stop feeding misinformation What? hand first card, get second. Well, boosters currently 65+ age.  wouldn’t qualify regardless. Genuinely harrowing people chose horse version... human approved version. Incredible. Covid, notably, makes people weaker mind body. Often permanently  amount money Chris Rock has, would definitely choose retirement working anti-vaxers. 

If Chris Rock’s position, he’s essentially CEO brand/company, thus power decide company works with, would definitely choose partner adamant anti-vaxer. 

If you’re normal worker normal job, neither options realistically available you.   way, need learn live since lot diseases viruses there.

It never stopped us living going anywhere.

We need get stronger mind I'm body. nice thing current vaccines target exact part virus (the spike protein) uses attach human cells. vaccines rendered ineffective spike protein would need change significantly, change would also likely lose ability attach human cells therefore become harmless. 
 
Never say never course, reason optimism.  Well looking Canada might give perspective. Right crisis Alberta's ICUs. number ICU cases significantly higher height 3rd wave. 60% population fully vaccinated. Alberta province like southern states. premier Alberta paid much attention anti-mask, anti-lockdown base soon vaccine rollout began way eager open remove restrictions. warned. ignored warning. ICUs paying price. restrictions back on.

By contrast, health unit (Ottawa, Ontario), 81% vaccinated. Cases rising steadily since hit zero cases back August. 9 cases hospital 7 ICU. doubt would able come back quickly sold. assumption renters. Surprised notice vaccination card, guess sign actually received shot. late then. Russian ""Sputnik"" vaccine vector-based even uses different vector viruses two doses getting 3rd Pfizer moderna booster? Well considering heard week ago it’s new keep date what’s going on. That’s don’t claim know much aside read understanding it’s testing furthest it’s proven yet I’m saying vaccine FDA approved people still don’t want try something newer Rand Paul says it’s better.

There's zero safety efficacy data mixing J&amp;J mRNA shot, good data mixing AZ mRNA, AZ biotech J&amp;J. personally go get unstudied mixture single shot shown sufficient least 8 months, understand people so. Hard call. obvious answer. technology similar AZ every western government told AZ peeps pick shot Pfizer Moderna second shot. 

People acting like vaccines super rare, super complicated, highly reactive drug can’t mixed matched. case we’d fucked. 

Sometimes take look NHS, Health Canada, Germans get sanity check FDA. try getting mrna shot got jj. turn away even immunocmpromised. going pharmacys city get mrna booster (being immunocmpromised) still give mrna even second jj approved mrna shots. regret right thing getting JJ thing offered time. known bullshit would waited couple months get mrna instead. vaccine reduce spread, eliminate hospitalization death.

I know people got covid 4 x getting vacinated. 2 x family members even healthy.

But thing healthy, got better 2-3 days. co morbids healthy week. get we're obese.

So I'm pro vacine. enough.

Even little, one start. Walking good one, step count. Improve daily. 10 mins wake up, 10 mins lunch. 10 mins dinner. Good know since that’s I’m headed drive around NE. Kinda disappointing vacationed expectation things better California.

I would support anyone else different condition UNAVOIDABLE (which, are) needed resource. Edit: could even COVID, what's important took precautions vaccinated. That's someone truly unlucky get deathly ill vaccinated. deserve treatment someone intentionally not.

Of course immune evasion would survival characteristic evolution within single host. that, still barely acquired - 18 months uncounted available unvaccinated hosts. could easily coincidence, although every VOC immune evasion, they're also uniformly contagious lineages replaced.

No, that's works (most time). time run trial multiple mutations course taken would different. exception mostly small genomes limited space changes, ones advantageous changes 'obvious' specific. general virus like many possible courses evolution probability specific ones vs others disproportionate. means it'll hard predict path taken even know paths potentially take. Imagine ten million people rolling die. easy generally asses certain things end result (proportion dice rolled certain way proteins experience mutations) hard (practically impossible) predict specific routes taken iteration/trial/run (what dice land person subgroup 100). state Australia new local cases today total 28 active cases - either hospital quarantine risk community. 

Pretty much cases Australia 2 states. No, average Walken speed 3-4 miles per hour, hope helped :)  Wait. why? reject vaccine well want vaccine can't get it?  find really hard believe 2020's middle global pandemic people still live early 1800s ""do believe vaccines"".

The ""I want over"" crowd sure dragging things longer last Perhaps policy of.... go sick due positive test, can't come back negative test vaccine. Come on. vaccine isn’t 100 percent infection. Never was. Never going be. That’s point. 7-10x less likelihood hospitalization though you’re vaccinated versus not. seatbelt doesn’t stop crash hurting it’ll often save damn life. Funny thing is, covid cause kinds nasty issues, often vaccine shown serious side effects. can’t get board logic people start argument. can’t wait schools mandate really hope so. tired knife's edge, worried kids.

I said “You never gave choice 5 get vaccinated immunization shots”

They said “Well required go school”


I expect happen hope does. agree argument overly pessimistic protection infection, numbers you’ve cited effectiveness preventing infection look like numbers effectiveness preventing symptomatic illness.

The three primary vaccine effectiveness statistics see cited effectiveness against:

1. Infection
2. Symptomatic Illness
3. Severe Illness

For convenience I'll refer number ;)

In early stages vaccination campaigns, 2. far cited figure. arrival Delta, public health authorities switched focusing 3.

[This discusses vaccine effectiveness Delta, stats 2 3, along detailed discussion 1. little table based stats article Pfizer’s protection Delta:

|**Effectiveness Type**|**% (95% CI)**||
|:-|:-|:-|
|Symptomatic Illness|85 (80–90)||
|Severe Illness|95 (90–99)||


Excerpt regarding effectiveness Although preliminary data published Ministry Health Israel caused much concern suggesting significant decline effectiveness symptomatic Delta infection, preprint published report effectiveness figures symptomatic infection symptoms reporting reliable national database. Vaccine effectiveness infection much harder measure estimates affected various biases testing criteria, behavior, exposure risk, immunity status population, community prevalence. Studies showed estimated 55%–80% effectiveness infection Delta dominant, modest decline seen prevention infection Delta. Scotland, vaccine effectiveness preventing RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 Delta infection 79% BNT162b2 60% AstraZeneca two doses.


I'm definitely curious see good protection third doses, couple months passed. passage several months since *second* dose means plenty time additional affinity maturation. say admitted ""as precaution""?

This article definitely helps still worries bit. would nice cheap test could home see antibody levels.  It’s well accepted limitation adenovirus viral vector vaccines. doubt Johnson Johnson would love show even small impact boosters, it’s going difficult show. Plus many survivors left long-term disabilities?

Many people COVID bad enough hospitalized never regain prior health.  replied reply regarding similarities differences people taking booster shot ""off script"" vs ivermectin.   


 


The FDA, CDC, WHO, NIH, IDSA, AMA, APA stated Ivermectin currently recommended treatment, cases harmful.  yes, largely concluded time ivermectin effective treatment covid. Okay maybe sounds cool paper France higher GDP Africa, 5.5% population Africa. 

Africa's population 1.216 billion, giving 10 million vaccines 3 months amounts making difference all. 

We celebrate PR stunts. demand actual action. Especially France colonised much Africa took bunch wealth resources itself, comparatively wealthy. 

In crisis like this, surely nation influential wealthy France better providing full 2-dose vaccination 0.4% African people? 3 months less? quite bit make one side first place. Lots existing research adenovirus viral vector vaccines. It’s hard grasp bad pandemic part big numbers abstract become meaningless point. 

This makes real me: U.S. people died C-19 live Wyoming Vermont. Washington DC next. Vaccines like seat belts. crash still going bad time get banged bit, better guy one road paste. Awesome thanks! use corticosteroids gathered qualified greater equal 20mg prednisone daily 2 weeks. I’d rather get booster trying get pregnant worry possibly advise get one first trimester good immunity wane period. still get moxidectin products? They're go course fenbendazole. used ivermectin years. increase resistance significant increased infectiousness. Delta might able evade vaccines, 1000x infectious might issue 10 20% increase breakthrough cases. Someone tell Lancet quiet listen science   next news, Christopher Walken made new Covid-19 announcement. started saying ""Guess what?!"" global mortality, 15M/8B = .002 = 0.2% .002% stated comment. Can't say changes conclusions though. Still pretty small probably small percent total yearly mortality causes. friend Canada got two different ones. hated hearing that.  casting judgment. thinking that's doing, another thing anti vax people point at. really need tighten stop anti vax arguements. 

That said hope safe protected all. 

But messaging matters. think dohickeys doors grocery store are? /s Facts tolerated around here. voted. info Moderna booster?         ""The estimated risk infection touching contaminated surface low (less 5 10,000), suggesting fomites play minimal role SARS-CoV-2 community transmission.""

/r/COVID19/comments/jm18yh/longitudinal_monitoring_of_sarscov2_rna_on/ still highly effective reducing odds catching COVID. Good question solid answer you. little focus antibody studies here, perhaps infection rates generally relatively low except narrow spike around Christmas.

The recent official estimate could find [8.6% population infected May seen estimates total antibody counts. *78 Four legs good, two legs better!  even making comparison know going that. speaking ivermectin. 


The FDA recommend approval medication see study meets double blind standards. lack approval right means ivermectin rejected. means want see evidence approving it. 

Also, FDA's current position sufficient claim, ""It largely concluded Ivermectin effective treatment covid."" Ivermectin approved India, world second populous country. also approved Mexico, Portugal, Brazil, Argentina, many others.

Too many people US bubble can't see outside it. got fever… go work chiropractor. Cvs. Im immunosuppressants, well weaning them, u think I'm eligible get early.  Birthrate decreases income.

Isn't point? Wealthy highly educated people fewer children, poor folks little education pump kids like rabbits. addition fueling environmental problems due overpopulation kids tend grow poor less educated makes likely vote conservative vote all. They'll easily manipulated believing things like ""climate change real"" ""vaccines turn crocodile"".  

No matter look it, increase number poor uneducated people *never* good thing society. Yeah would nice could get lives people start using common sense, able to. Would nice offer boosters J&amp;J year. glad get J&amp;J, really got screwed people immunocompromised next variant.  Reading shit facebook consulting medical publications. 

Besides, taking vaccine driving drunk without seatbelt. Deciding get booster is, worst case, wearing bike helmet car seatbelt on.  treatments reduce severity disease, shorten time people ill reduce likelihood hospitalization. Vaccination also people greater risk even vaccinated makes sense would want extra insurance getting severely ill. incorrect narrative needs dropped. primary effect vaccine prevent infection (5-20x risk reduction). Reducing severity infected distant, though still significant right, second (3-5x risk reduction).

Source: every study breakthrough frequency, every piece data breakthrough CFR. Yeah wonder that's initial reluctance. I'll admit someone second priority group getting vaccine little nice knowing thousands old people gotten fine. point though wait give kid, cdc/fda/doctor says recommended I'm down.  Weird, pro-vaccine comment got removed. Per Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) used collect reports adverse events vaccination general public. primarily used identify potential topics investigate regards vaccine reactions.

A bit sarcasm, seriously, done shit, 12 getting vaccine, monitoring vaccines happen see side effects, finally 100% vaccinated family. really shitty year half, trying make sure loved ones killed shit.


THANK YOU, science! Advisory panel think countries needing first dose. Plus real first hand date mass use /s  Oh, sure. trust experts going nail right timeframe give boosters. It’s question start hit efficacy limits set. It’s starting little less dark end tunnel, though. Maybe light exactly, pitch black either. didn’t hear stories terrible staff shortages pre-Covid.

Probably boiling frog situation? Staffing gradually became worse save money? Maybe. majority parents know run kids first shot ASAP.    saying delayed census? 19 month old. Absolutely cannot wait. kid lived whole life pandemic got come bubble little bit numbers crashed earlier summer. can't wait able take everywhere worry people around him. many people thinking effect hoax. agree idea even vaxxed folks hesitant it’s less 49% number would otherwise indicate. One assume much 51% that’s hesitant made population already won’t get it, probably 25%+ parents (if more, since unvaxxed population probably disproportionately child rearing age). it’s something like 25-33% vaxxed parents hesitant. probably isn’t different original number adults open “wait see” opinion Olympic athlete peak physical condition,

doesn't always translate peak immunity, tradeoffs Hospitalization rates children already low, assume child vaccinated vaccine incredibly low chance admitted hospital. 

Child vaccination however play major role road towards herd immunity. suppose show there's vastly increased incidence. could much 10x higher numbers, lot that.

Given cases mild anyhow, I'm concerned.  dosage problem. Remember kids 3 can’t get flu shot either it’s weird kids last “tested”. aren’t much danger adults vaccinated too. sorry hardships dealt with. situation describing sounds lot like wife described NYC hospital March 2020. hope hospitals live clear patients within capacity soon. wish daughter best health safety.  I’m saying “ignore” anything.

The risk isn’t zero, isn’t “high” well line risks take. vaccinated people, similar risk influenza.

As said, take steps mitigate. important understand actual risk is. state (OH) opened 12 age group able get boys first available day. upset prospect able 7 y/o daughter. She’s excited get it, too. talks couple times week. People want kids get COVID. you’re sayin got chance pediatric dosage specifically designed balance myocarditis risk immunogenicity, seems succeeded. case, research data clear whether risk myocarditis 1/1000 1/100,000 - Canadian study outlier far, also could differ based screening criteria. seems like weird middle ground one shot estimated reduce chance contracting covid exposed 55%.

Almost myocarditis risk shot 2 though, kinda weird, that's tips balance risk benefit analysis. Cries Florida. We'll never see mandates here, long Must Named governor. (Good you, downvoters! L E G E N .)

You getting downvoted borderline toll level posting thread. I'm surprised people upset 700k citizens died. guess actual war less impactful. Big same. Maybe time tighten up, too.  usually happens drug vaccine trials upon completion trial, company releases short PR statement summarizing key findings, full peer reviewed paper regulatory analysis following later.

Since many drug companies publicly traded, trial outcomes market sensitive information. proper paper detailing trial fully analyzing outcome would require input many employees company, well contributions external parties. That's insider trading nightmare waiting happen. Consequently, company let skeleton crew view results create short PR statement. people monitored insider trading activities. statement out, pressure full team work thorough review without needing secrecy.

So that's often see companies making claims drug vaccine well detailed information supporting claims becomes available. allow mutate potentially get much worse point starts killing huge numbers kids.

Quit dramatic. advised everyone wear masks (even showing properly applied), social-distance properly.... Western Media (and WHO) listen him?

Er, talking Australia here. got outbreak back 0 cases months. 

We cant zero covid forever. havent thought slightest.  Yup

/u/okram2k /r/confidentlyincorrect  2 5 can't wait get approved, going take longer us. I'm done shit There's 3k deaths breakthrough cases far. That's number annual deaths food poisoning. ignore those, too?

Covid cause pneumonia asthma make one susceptible pneumonia. won’t feel 100% details boosters totally understood kid shot. 

Im thinking we’re going see reports soon show reduction efficacy time we’ll know booster work. vaccinated laws worried kids.

For instance aspirin rarely cause serious frequently fatal brain liver disease children teens take certain viral illnesses, adults, called Reye’s syndrome. cause isn’t well understood couldn’t predicted based adult data. 

I understand caution approving vaccine children, especially they’re least likely suffer serious health effects virus, think there’s huge difference giving vaccine whole population children giving trial group numbers thousands. think amount time took get data ridiculous teens younger children recruited trials soon vaccine approved adults. three age 12 currently wait get vaccinated, hopefully Moderna vaccine.

Personally don’t kids would get vaccinated. guess surge beginning turns trickle. adults wait 90 days known infection receiving vaccine? Can't even get 20 year olds vaccinate.

The data shows people 60 years old unvaxed 3 times likely get severe case vaxed (in age group). 60 5 times likely.

I mean 70 % ICU beds Israel begging august taken 6.3 % 90+ year olds unvaxed.

HOWEVER, since lot people vaxed, bound need ICU (you see graphs yourself), question still stands:

HOW POSSIBLE 0 VAXED PEOPLE ICU?

To statments like : ""I also work Covid unit. I’ve yet see one single vaxxed person admitted."" smell like BULLSHIT. like saying: "" research"", fits narrative.

Since seeing one single vaxed person admitted ICU statistically unlikely, still possible asked OP work, interests me, baffles mind got downvotes.

Also would love get (real) source confirms vaxed patients ICU possible?

RN pay went exponentially due shortage hospitals fighting RNs. RNs flocking travel agencies due incredible $100+/hr rates. 

And current state. original post, referring future holds. widely known aging population going issue soon large amount doctors nurses retiring next 10-15 years. producing healthcare workers fast enough fill need.  Pfantastic. give damn. I'm homeschooling 8 year old protect are. Louisiana. Going two years now. misses friends badly. Roll vaccine out, I'll first line get send back school. FUCK NOISE. I'm going pull kids school first morning available we're going camp shot. 

I'm ready done goddamn pandemic. want kids protected go stuff again. mindset couple months ago summer. everybody mother started getting break cases. Seriously know way got breakthrough infections original Covid. 

And world basically opened again, get breakthrough case you’re fucked isolate sets back far before. doubt 5 year olds much easier time comprehending need masks compared 2 year old. I’m impressed follow talking lunch rule! I’ve heard idea implemented states, I’m sure wouldn’t go well. Vaccinces cause autism 2.0! /s

I can't wait next Jenny Mccarthy step ruin people's lives /ss  Certainly they're tired winning now. course would- good parents would do!

I even ready vaccinate 16 year old, confessed suicidal ideation surrounding pandemic isolation. hearing that, bets off. mean, well yes?

Thank expert take.  much debate even pre-Covid? I’m still hoping 6 month+ time soon! I’d feel much better daycare kid got vaccinated.

He’ll first line available age group. parent that's sending unvaccinated child school 5 days week, one knows exactly meant

Then say mean, can't ""not care"" do.

I send four children school every day well, two cannot vaccinated approval goes through. definitely comforting, deep relief suddenly either. still issues looming heads cannot control. article last week said expecting data younger kids like month 5-11 group. I’ll find post link edit.

Edit:  That’s also good clarification. understood I’m still glad said something clarify! lost someone madness. still thinks fake.

It'd real shame caught Delta... Exactly. Let kill off. long last family others risk won’t pay price staggering selfishness. fucking reason hesitant? Seriously, kids get shots kinds shit age five, isn’t different. husband got referred specialist another specialist. literally told us going call specialist talk appointment. First thing new doctor says sits stack notes ""Now, here?"" 

I wanted say, ""We fucking know."" Children 3 can’t get FluMist live attenuated virus. Children 6 months age get regular flu shot, fact little ones get 2 doses. Ok, see, kids got covid vaccine (including 8 yr old Pfizer trial right now), low risk HPV right now, I'm waiting long possible them, dont feel safe HPV vaccine yet, SARS COV 2 vaccine.  Let's fucking gooooooooo! know it’s scientific, family friends various areas practicing Florida. seeing drops. Seems 1/3 3 weeks ago. 


They reaching form “turd” immunity running unvaccinated people still get sick.  I'm sorry dude. That's painful situation, can't imagine industry that's blow career well. “The data came little earlier expecting, depending long FDA takes review application, whether four week review six week review, could vaccine available children early probably end October, perhaps slips little bit November.""

Whole family fully vaxxed time holidays? Yes please! 🙏🏼 think end, would it, would wrung hands it.  hospitalisations? haunting wrong ppl. Haunt conservative leaders tv+radio hosts made political brainwashed idiots anti-vax. Can't escape, eh? cake-day..allegedly. Highly sus. 👀 Upvoting imposter.  2.

Meds administered within one hour administration time. 9 a.m. meds given 8-10 a.m. , everyone floor, assuming nothing interrupts like Code Brown needs clean-up btw, nurse techs could handle paid WAY little, risk injury work, usually fully staffed. don’t think answer. Cant wait get 11 year old vaxxed mom idea would actually kids still little, pandemic- parenting past 18 months, idea parents kids gone through. 

My 8 year old gladly participated Pfizer trial. hear getting vaccinated would make safer go back school person. 24- 48 hours mild fever/ flu- like symptoms, great several months since. 

Please, parents, please it. dose age tiny. safe. kid heart murmur, heart totally fine. kids deserve feel safer lost much opportunities growth development past 18 months. expected past Delta’s peak. We’ll wait see winter brings us though. Last year toll “only” 250k, one acquaintances time referred “collateral damage,” tried insist Trump wasn’t fucking pandemic response.

I longer acquainted person hearing say that. 9/11: 3k dead, heaps outrage (rightfully so)
COVID: 700k dead, 9/11 every days: it’s hoax people’s eyes. I'm sorry hear that, kid doing? bit afraid people would take post children risk, obviously are.

I’ve heard 6 month 4 year old group wasn’t going far behind 5-11 year old group well, think sites computing vaccination percentages may using different population figures.  numerator, different denominator, get different percentages.

My wife, 5th grade math specialist, told whole thing huge impacts kids. mental health, education levels. many drastically behind social skills even worse normal. new kindergartners 1st graders worst off. colleges say so. anti-vaxx movement seem spread significantly Spanish speaking world. No, measure overall risk reduction vs. unvaccinated person (i.e. risk infected, risk overall).

So imagine 3 groups 100K people (matched age, comorbidities, etc.); 100K unvaccinated, 100K received Pfizer 120+ days ago, 100K received Moderna 120+ days ago. 100 unvaccinated people hospitalized given period time, time period expect 23 Pfizer group (77% risk reduction) 8 Moderna group (92% risk reduction) would also hospitalized. buy horses make cost 3 times usual antivaxxers get proof higher cost? Pfizer stands make 5 billion 

And magically game town using technology, might concerned.

This always going way worked out. pharma companies got licensing rights developed vaccines ALWAYS going make lots money society. 

There way current society ever going see repeat free-as-in-freedom salk vaccine polio.

There already huge amounts independent non-pharma controlled data mRNA vaccines. Seems relatively easy thing start implementing, someone check passport ID go. part sucks employees deal “muh freedom” customers inevitable come cause scene.  Damn sucks. feel you. still worry kids school mask mandated kids sanitize entering leaving room. hope kid stays safe healthy! line get vaccine ASAP. already vaccinated 12 year old two need match! Swimmers aren’t actually rich famous. There’s barely money swimming, people can’t name swimmer Michael Phelps. exactly feel. two youngest vaccinated, everyone else jump cliff want. mother law still risk got third dose hopefully safer. know unvaccinated still cause issues variants, lets focus getting poorer countries vaccinated turn purple arguing folks great. I'm frustrated getting clear answer one way another. Check Concierge Medicine. future good one. live worst timeline.  longer interval doses might help, giving one dose head start that.

In data presented FDA last Friday, Israel reported exactly one myocarditis case 6 month booster (vs lots dose 2).  

see slide 41: additional work needed determine that's due 3rd dose (with got myo previous dose opting out) longer since previous dose both.  mean aren’t seeing old people dying now, it’s unvaccinated young people families etc evident point arguing bad faith. I'm done.

Stop Holy shit, people completely forget behave airplane lockdowns?  want data explanation that’s pharma companies American government.

Data explanation what, exactly?  feel right there. know seems little talk age group. Maybe I'm missing it, I'm tired keeping toddler cooped  SOOOO many questions antibodies. one, study started, delta barely present US. little research available levels antibodies protect COVID adults, certainly even challenging extrapolate children. delta, threshold antibodies prevents breakthrough infection? breakthrough infection, certain antibody levels prevent complications long COVID myocarditis? higher antibody levels lessen severity Illness breakthrough infection? know. data months behind. clutch faux pearls. kids getting vaccinated soon possible. Would make absolutely zero difference.  That's rough mama. Keep keeping on, take care internet stranger.   Yeah, allowed people offered JJ wait like 2-3 weeks, could gotten pick crop. grand scheme things, especially vaccines still give way breakthrough cases require boosters, think 2-3 weeks really mattered much all.

It rushed pressuring ""TaKe WhAtEvEr CaN"". get that. nuance well. able actually discuss differences three, instead bullying people asking questions.  Yes agree. worry mutations, hospital availability. really shame. vaccination 5 12 ease stress though. Public shaming probably people Japan wear masks. would way embarrassed even consider going indoor place mask free. I'm running non crowded place, wear one outside well. drinking walking, keep mask chinstrapped pull face coming within 3 4 meters someone. common decency.

I currently cannot reasonably go home (USA) see family quarantine rules risk getting trapped outside Japan, honest, seeing scary people makes never want go back. really sad since want see family, mental health cannot deal craziness anti vaxxers antimaskers. truly 0 cases 2268 participants, odds observing zero cases random chance approximately 1 10

I'm skeptical 1 1000 rate, seem realistic compared information overall population understand leadership board harming base. make sense me. kind hill die on? want protect votes? exactly accomplishing riling *literally* dying party? Agreed, biggest takeaway IMO deaths happened within 18 months, DESPITE crazy measures took contain thing.

If locked down, society actually could broken down. Food, energy, etc. depend bodies place. let's spotlight consequences people trying flat deny rules?

then happens next time, somebody scream bloody murder can't believe actually enforcing this, know fantastic news. father child younger this, really hope next phase soon.    someone explain many different vaccination rates US? Specifically state data, I've looked one (my state fairly high vaccination rate). I've also used USA facts, world data, data.democratandcronicle, etc. others too, including CDC site. course state tracker well.

The problem is, everyone slightly different. understand it, especially since feeds CDC. know data often backlogged data several days old, I'm sure much variation. Yes, small, think data (for US anyway) would same. Part glad guy die maybe story help others get vaccinated, also pisses idiot got shit ton medical care preventable situation. 

I really hope insurance companies start charging insane premiums people vaccinated. Seems crazy risky to. I'm guessing highly regional. south several states already passed laws prohibiting schools requiring COVID-19 vaccinations even fully approved.  Unfortunately it’s boomers cult People like literally punching kicking flight attendants. causing flight delays 3+ hours. go hell, precious egos bear song disgusted people flight sit wait tantrums resolve like dealing 3 year olds.

They're lucky got song acting like fools. wife fully vaccinated Pfizer. got breakthrough infections. laid 3 days. Fever 104F. felt like absolute garbage. sickness landed sinuses, head throat. wife's landed sinuses, throat chest.

Once onset symptoms received regeneron treatment. Still couple days misery symptoms went away, went away. ""decline"" symptoms. went bed feeling like shit one night woke feeling normal next morning.

My daughter brought Covid home school. 7. infected son, 11 us. symptoms? Headache, low grade fever one day. normal day 2. son headache, slight cough, low grade fever lost smell taste. symptoms gone day 3 (except taste smell, that's still kind thing).

We back normal except wife still fighting remnants pneumonia left lung. still cough.

The thing fucking bothers FAR safest came this. vaccinated soon could be, wear masks religiously, wear gloves grocery store, etc. 

Against better judgement, sent kids in-person school within 3 days school, Covid.

I feel like, without regeneron, may much tougher time.

Don't fuck around find out. shit's real it'll knock down. too. recently started working gotten lot worse, needed regain sense normalcy Wonder many kids died unnecessarily waited long test kids. Thank trying reason them, although careful. infuriates see people masking bc want protect 12 s. get angry can't kind, say nothing.

Hmmmm alone. I've basically stopped trusting people ever right thing, collectively anyway. I'm grateful group stayed sane, though. long sampling good (ie, kids kinds different environmental biological backgrounds) fine.

Sample sizes need astronomically huge, especially effect looking big. case, effect looking huge (does vaccine create adequate amount anti-bodies, adverse reactions vaccine). 2,500 lot bigger lot samples get.

It’s complicated hard articulate. don’t clinical medical research, I’m psychology graduate student, math checks accounts. Again, people experts. They’ve research like careers, building research established them. don’t randomly come numbers.  point at. Three us vaccinated shots ready younger kids get vaccinated well. I'm worrying someone else doing. That's attitude I've whole time I've living states. Ever since first vaccine ever created anti-vax people, hear interconnected social media. there, unvaccinated (christian scientists!), pawing everything sneezing people, know face it. someone want vaccine want roll dice lives, go it, really want genes get passed anyway, good luck you.

humans.”  That's FDA data going spend next 3 6 weeks see they'll approve not. Lmao yes, like ""walk away"" movement never happened, doctors nurses quitting en masse.

They aren't. already vaccine mandates. Wait honest question racist? mentioning race people involved racist? would guess next age group provide sources anecdotal? Frankly, constant stream anti-vax propaganda right past 8 months, people would much less concerned. science clear.

Thanks comment though. Maybe aren’t smart?  say *want* new normal, fuck going back old normal! Fuck hell back! Thanks! see broken age group according [this numbers 12-15 33% fully vaccinated 45% least first dose. Nay. That’s choice. kid get mine soon can.

Many women gotten pregnant post-vaccine. precisely zero impact fertility vaccine.   need to show proof full vaccination prior boarding U.S.-bound planes. A COVID-19 test will also continue required within three days departure proof negative results must also required**

So hypocritical. kid first line. incredibly stressful trying keep safe stupid science denying idiots everywhere. Oh farts Given extremely low rate COVID deaths among kids, see parents would think it’s necessary, getting kids vaxxed still help us lot slowing spread. 13 year old vaccined I’ve dying get 11 year old vaccined god gives much relief honestly knew safe- waited go! According CDC far almost 78% Covid deaths occurred people 65 older. look people 50 older, basically age group mostly isn’t working entry level jobs service industry, account 94% Covid deaths.

65+ deaths: 511,673

I’m eager get vaccinated earliest opportunity that, someone stated, finally stop feeling like beg every anti-vaxxer care people Yup, former best friend vaccinated moved goal posts hard became FDA approved. She’s super worried vaccine “affect kids development” aka uteruses.  Yessss... Bring school mandates :)  Except break cases happen ( probably one now. Test back yet) we’re likely see abs worse variants. flipping hate ppl. everyone got vaxed delta would much less problem now. regular flu though right? I'm sure I'm alone asking this. live London take public transport here, required still wear mask. There's enforcement though, lots people it. I'm one people. 
 
Simply put, always told masks really protect wearer, protect around wearer getting infected wearer. altruistic thing wear mask. 
 
But people still need protecting? UK every adult every chance world get vaccinated protect way. need wear mask. 
 
The people benefit wearing mask ones refused get vaccines. extra effort (cause let's honest, wearing mask hot tube bus annoying) protect antivaxxers? 
 
I realize groups could get vaccinated, e.g. allergic reactions components vaccine past. honesty point talking small group population think fair enforce everyone wear mask rest lives transport. might well start enforcing mask wearing flu season ones can't get flu jab then. 
 
I'm really open changing mind honest. feel opinion moment fair really sympatico. again, maybe want sympatico antivaxxers. said spreading misinformation clearly wasn't.. arguing this? true, one part larger purpose provide source literally already did. CDC link references disease prevention. 

You said words true source provided true, source said. include every single little detail vaccine needed adamant vaccines designed prevent infection? That's misinformation I'm trying push back on.

I never said that. assuming things. diehard saying vaccines number 1 priority reducing transmission. clearly multiple priorities vaccine.

From source: people fully vaccinated COVID-19 still get sick vaccine 100% effective. Experts continue monitor evaluate often occurs, severe illness is, likely vaccinated person spread COVID-19 others.

And bullet point: COVID-19 vaccines currently available United States effective preventing COVID-19 seen clinical trial settings.

Preventing covid getting sick. Getting sick usually implies hospitalization test done confirm/deny illness may experiencing. getting sick implies covid system enough get sick, implies reduces transmission. Alot things works hand hand vaccine. sick people pushing vaccines intended prevent infection also reduce disease severity breakthroughs occur. That's chose respond.

I advocating ever said that. YET, choose say misinforming others. CLEARLY, CDC, ""COVID-19 vaccines also help keep getting seriously ill even get COVID-19."". really trying argue one, ONE, part vaccine IGNORE PARTS? 

You must trolling point tendency wanting right time? defending position true. every single detail vaccine? No. still stand true? Yes. Especially comment sever symptoms. know deleted comment user us make sense all. it’s collective average IQ rising… sounds like win! can’t fucking wait give child vax. live Florida, surrounded dipshits think hoax/no big deal/etc. I’ll feel much better he’s last one house get it. can't wait none get it! ""Results youngest children — 6 months 2 years old — expected October thank god.

There's something injections psychologically weirds people about. could put SARS-CoV-2 vaccine processed chicken nugget, ice cream cone, mac ""cheeze"", parents kids age think twice. vaccine like polio vaccine offers near 100% protection. pandemic restrictions still continue even get vaccinated. I'm vaccinated still got Covid. Israel around 69% vaccinated currently surge.

Pfizer paid million settlements testing children . Yous walked gladly mass testing willingly offering children madness.
I understand protection vulnerable young healthy people need vaccine.   I'm still one waiting 6mo + approvals, I'm glad kindergartener free Christmas things without fear. work informed us someone tested positive COVID. said vaccinated person 'close contact' desks 6 feet apart, ridiculous one wears mask desk also indoor circulation poor. I'm vaccinated symptoms going get tested anyway. question -- would irresponsible go hike park maintain significant distance others wait results? Obviously I'd avoid indoor spaces double-mask go inside anywhere. hard families children :(. helps feel better, know couple families dragged unvaccinted children everywhere, kids got awfully sick Delta. downplay difficulties means, keeping little one safe. Kids 5 (but 6 months) vaccinated soon too, quite soon. Pfizer estimates able release data young kids released today older ones late October. Yep, think probably common think. know handful 2019 2020 babies delays. much think masks (Which necessary unfortunately) affect ability learn speak. bet huge. would really interesting see studies actually. According FDA, seems correct. would interesting school districts say vaccinate kids, yare automatically enrolled remote classes, area vaccinated. school boards guts should. parents want vaccinate kids overlap greatly need kids school. Cool. Thanks tip I’m going vaccine. Feel free not. Here's I'm at. vaccinated extremely unlikely exposed point.

So vaccination kicked in... boosted getting exposed.

Elders? Probably need artificial boost.

Normal otherwise healthy people going day day almost certain exposed routinely, mass boosting isnt... neccessary?

Is gist? angering me. 18 month old soon gonna newborn I’m stuck keep babies selfish idiots. audacity tell I’m bad mom I’m constantly bringing child “but socialization?!” I’m trying keep alive right thanks people like making harder!  Lol, no. 

Public health organisations actively lie. white lies, designed overall beneficial society, lies nonetheless.

Remember said masks effective beginning pandemic? shortage PPE equipment intended medical staff, lie prevent general public wiping stock

Another thing they're ignoring natural immunity despite providing better long lasting immune vaccines. Why? want people intentionally infect themselves. white lie, lie nonetheless.

Problem is, wackjobs misinterpret 'government conspiracy' fuels anti-vaxx hysteria. long FDA approval emergency use need, though? hope fast. parent, already made decision vaccinate kids. $64M question Yeah, realize long since infected. Places recognize post-infection immunity substitute vaccination limited time, like six months. data clear moment, mere possibility immunity fading year means get vaccinated.

Heart disease ""only"" kills \~1800 per day\*, we're back point covid competing top cause death. least we're point covid killed next top 5 causes death combined . Looks like 5-11 getting EUA soon… pattern - large uncontrolled outbreak across south moves mountain west Midwest. bad need worry. /s Let's gooooooo vaccination committee UK said advise vaccinating children benefit marginal. means take quite low think. people get COVID without wanting dying, that's price freedumzzz, guess.

It pretty awful married, successful couple wanted kids, talk even go Covid getting worse understand antivax people, couple assaulted waitress? need scream ""FREEDOM"".  friggin hilarious idiots ""fighting freedom"" keeps taking away everyone elses freedom? 

I wonder idiots problems signs bathrooms reminding people wash hands. Translation: People tithe pay luxury lifestyle, can’t dying off.  Requiring masks restaurant you’re dining still make little sense.

Anyways, even start pandemic people didn’t wear masks “health issues,” always wondered risked going crowded stores restaurants. many caught Trump cult. First ""just flu,"" whining masks, they're dead preventable. % unvaccinated going too.   can't wear hours duration flight? like making wear days. even let remove eat drink. man wants ban mandatory vaccinations every childhood illness ban treatment unconscious patients hospitals. population Wyoming, Vermont, almost many Washington DC.  Right, what's next? going require vaccine diseases even higher survival rates like chicken pox? Oh wait...  Yep. powerup, time hit button controller. Oh sorry beeing ""hung up"".
I thought could doubt people write forums debate. ask questions.
My bad, guess belive everything read online. 1000% agreed. vaxxed (and safely vaccinated) hospitals bounds you. 

Also, give vaccine moratorium. set date, vaccines cost 1000 dollars piece (excwpt kids stupid teenagers). But, goal decrease infections vaccinations. eventually reach point unlikely exposed method work anymore? think missed part he/she mentioned already covid….  Same, here's kid's arm, GOGOGO.

Wait, need attached body?  Yes. Pfizer going lie trial results right submitting data multiple regulatory agencies around world. vaccines way feel hard. Every day check trials see space opened up. know going happen makes feel like I'm something. feel like tools get children safe limited. according cdc guidelines though, think matters overall circulation regards six feet rule, could double check.

No. clear one way I’m explaining others feel feel - intend get child vaccinated. preparing wants toy :-)  Every single video YouTube says anything remotely positive vaccines littered 90%+ dislikes comments antivaxx people. I'm sure bots bad faith actors sad see many people spreading misinformation, sow even distrust among general public idiots. important part right here: 


""B-cells still generate new cAbs exposed virus, take several days delays time neutralize virus relative takes blood flowing abundant neutralizing antibodies. days enough time window virulant aggressive variant like Delta replicate sufficiently produce positive PCR test, sometimes produce symptomatic breakthrough infection, even cases produce severe critical disease.

I think boosters need long term strategy.  need control rate infection reduce hospitalizations right now.  Months line see booster shots offer longer lasting protection, discussion continued doses likely severe cases breakthroughs.  mean time, need everything get ahead virus.  understand coming from. Honestly, Gardasil new parents pediatrician want give 11-12. since virgin 23, doctors never made big deal me, feel like applied me. think might way old get now? beyond that, rare genetic issues still investigated kids I, doctors pushing Gardasil right now. We're current recommended shots, I'm sure I'm going keep getting downvoted anyway.

Not gonna lie, notwithstanding, various class action Gardasil lawsuits contributed hesitancy...Let downvoting begin...😒 Oof. Irish twins? ""bracing for""?

Too late, we're it. work pharmacy phones ringing wall morning, asking boosters

We tell we're waiting FDA CDC approve it, pisses said 12, would people believe it? there's ID check mostly kids age IDs parents Hint; population smaller back comparing apples oranges. Learn think critically. Honestly, Moderna seems one consistently good news, I've least seen, I'll wait kids.  See? like flu!

/s  COVID circulates among animals, it’ll never completely disappear like small pox. Hell fucking yes still lived functioning society rules put place. “But maybe that's mean? Instead objective headlines lie.”

Assume want intentions. Whatever floats boat. It’s always separated age groups I’m hoping get ones younger kids soon. three year old would nice able take places. wears mask like little champ though! proud well that.   Cdc act within scope fda authorizes. Fda didn’t set age limits, cdc could. since did, cdc can’t go outside that.

I’m simplifying significantly, that’s gist.  medical care actually preventing many deaths though? sense even today, it’s bad enough hospital, it’s sort roll dice survive. good news myocarditis incidence 1 2000 (around that), going find myocarditis cases study n 4500?

Pfizer press release, May 10 addition, pediatric study evaluating safety efficacy Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine children 6 months 11 years age ongoing. Pfizer BioNTech expect definitive readouts and, subject data generated, submit EUA variation Conditional Marketing Authorizations two cohorts, including children 2-5 years age 5-11 years age, September. readout submission cohort children 6 months 2 years age expected fourth clearly data want 2-5 yet since cohort slipped September. would right surface transmission (called formites) covid doesn't. However flu heading flu season. ""I could reduce chance child suffering dying...but could stick libs""

A+ parenting. eeh, let get it. sooner wipe better everyone wonder would happen gave someone 10mg... Hmmmm funny say …. seen list drugs approved get recalled? recalled surgical devices?  Goddammit. Woah - sealioning?!

A way rationalize providing evidence civil discussion? perfect you. data showed likely that? seen estimate high ""what if"" long shot looked linear extrapolation based couple data points. can’t wait see many people look back time realize fucking dumb oblivious were. Considering like 150M 14M people mRNA vs J&amp;J, people get J&amp;J. people J&amp;J either wanted single shot, easily tracked multiple doses, issues getting appointments, (wrongly) thought J&amp;J michbokdee vaccine tech, afraid needles.

And getting vaccine months ago best advice. Delta changed lot guidance. even back known Day 1 J&amp;J offer good protection. jabbed since Feb. wife since April. said, cannot good conscience give 6 year old vaccine. can't. Questionable parenting Moderna higher dose dosing shots 4 weeks vs 3. might contribute better immunity. Whether holds kids, known. Might know something next spring. odds spreading covid someone passing hike astronomically small. Get tested 4-5 days exposure would say ideally twice (harder catch positive testing vaccinated). avoid going better CDC doesn’t recommend quarantining cause they’re confident you’ll probably fine. exposed two times indoors group maybe 10 people nobody caught covid. Vaccines still highly effective Please blame white people solely this.

It's literally everybody.

Nobody immune ignorance. bring 4-month-old sample size trial incredibly small, Eric Topol said **""But strong assertions safety, low incidence side-effects like myocarditis, cannot made trial \~1500 children.""** Thank trying get study. joke 8 year old tell friends school, ""You're *WELCOME*!!"" really proud study, get even excited found he's getting paid it...😄

By time finally got scared enough pre-register trial, 3,000 kids candidate waiting list. I'm pretty sure dumb luck called us needed 8 year olds.One best friends still kicking daily second guessing preregistering son. honestly comfort anxiety feel every time get notified another case school...

Hang there. Soon! 🤞 Nah   Hey settle down, ok? hell? poor hostess! bills paid fucking assholes. I'm suggesting parents vaccinate kids can't make decision
 themselves, read response false equivalence adult's situation child's.  I’m leaning toward 4 times current number, sociology standpoint.

And COVID variants, contagions we’ll certainly see. Theres certain kind cruelty there, murder wasnt enough, no, taunt him, take mask right front him, provoking 20yo, probably worked get cash. comes big shock, firearm crimes rarity germany. idiotic reason, vaccines, almost feels like soon. Anti-vax parents give shit Yes, yes. mean. willfully ignorant...I mean unvaccinated. Wrong. Vaccinated people aren’t contagious unless they’ve exposed virus.

None approved vaccines North America live virus them. 

The way shed virus you’ve actually gotten virus. vaccinated covid contagious people viral load drops far faster unvaccinated. 

Scientists medical professionals aren’t censored claim. They’re making hypotheses get proven wrong. still continue pushing proven false experimentation analysis people make point quell misinformation facts need removing misleading statements. It’s one thing hypothesis it’s another thing disproven continue pushing said disproven claim. vaccine requirement testing opt out. 

Cities states paying bill testing people 'they feel like getting vaccine.' I'm concerned mutations breeding unvaccinated population chance break infection hitting someone know, main concern right even. main concern could car accident heart attack able admitted emergency room covid cases filling hospitals. getting worse get idiots vaccinated. school (elementary, middle/high school) required date vaccines measles, mumps, chicken pox, several others (these ones could think top head). longer thing? mean, really issue, I'm 38 date vaccines requirement thing entire life. principal concern occuring often. showing sample size, side effects profile worse, sufficient confidence incidence become high enough make covid better alternative.  Yes absolutely is. Patients anywhere moderate severe cases pretty much always present low oxygen saturation’s compatible life prolonged period hypoxia. cases people sent home form ER oxygen needed oxygen hospital days week would mostly mortalities without it.

COVID patients aren’t dying lung damage. dying secondary bacterial infections, blood clots, kidney failure. Antibiotics, steroids, blood thinners, dialysis making huge difference keeping patients alive.

The majority hospitalized Covid patients get go home. patients likely would died without medical intervention. Nah that's silver lining getting vaccinated. science tells us good kids know good go general widespread use It’s clear bring child. articles imply without him. last week Natalie Wester husband went Hang Time, bar restaurant Rowlett, say don’t often new you’ve ever new parents, couple hours like twice month important mental health,” Wester said.

This article appears incorrectly add bit son them, it’s original article on-air interview.   You’d think touching mask even touching everything anything airport/plane would dumb idiotic thing according science, fuck science right It’s clear bring child. articles imply without him. last week Natalie Wester husband went Hang Time, bar restaurant Rowlett, say don’t often new you’ve ever new parents, couple hours like twice month important mental health,” Wester said.

ETA: article appears incorrectly add bit son them, it’s original article on-air interview. Thank bravery, hers. think people partake trials heroes, you’re making possible vaccines save many lives. better wearing cape Halloween costume. mitigate chance catching something passing along baby?

Not defending actions. Pretty stupid imo, that's logical enough. Totally okay! reason know outside Mormon Yup! That’s whole like point Mormon church living prophet still. super similar Christian religions. There’s small differences that’s big one. Glad everyone mostly recovered.

They're eating restaurant obviously masks good chunk time they're close proximity immunocompromised child. Yep. 1.5 4 me. poor kids get tested every time sneeze feels like. think lot parents anxiety fatigue trying keep kids safe.  Totally invalid comparison:

They comparing evaluative number — historical sum — current running count.

The article seems think describe actions &amp; cost inaction NOW; years begin kind examination.

All say today “well, enough people didn’t learn destructive contagion is.”

(And know certain many states undercounted deaths, many deliberately reporting, plus early deaths good testing) offered different locations near two, availability always different. got appointments family members JJ al available people spamming BS “they’re it’s selfish preference get one”. do, still spread getting vaccine fucking stupid. course want protect kids best can, remember comparing safety sip water, comparing covid. Long covid MIS-C kids real concern. far early predict developmental consequences damage we're seeing lungs even nervous system, even mild asymptomatic cases.

To wait another 6 months past EUA think pharma companies would something self destructive fabricating safety data children (sorry that's paranoia, there's huge amounts profiteering corruption, faking trial results legitimate worry), really reevaluate whether that's smaller two risks. Person wearing BLM shirt: hurting anyone.
Person wearing ""fuck police"" shirt: hurting anyone.
Person wearing mask pandemic: hurting around them.

The last one asshole. like person plane punching people would asshole. think I’ll mentality. Problem is, youngest 5 still won’t able get vaccine even it’s approved 5-11. absolutely go hike. chances asymptomatically transmitting virus someone might fleeting interaction outside minuscule. could even go buy rapid test cvs extra extra peace mind. Exactly this. kids eaten since March 2020 need bring anywhere. wife also done lots curbside stuff, takes planning stores figured later evening pickups. 

Not mention curbside food restaurant pay extra $8 UberEats deliver. obviously money eat safely. 

I guess I'm tired people thinking anymore new normal clickbait articles selfish people damn day. son 3 he’s getting ASAP. Canadian deer carry covid! can't get plane  Tbh I'm flight longer two hours, use bathroom 3-5 mins want get mask little bit. Like there's many obvious loopholes want cause scene. agree. better judgment. day one applied go back home learning. Unfortunately, waitlisted. got accepted Monday following first day school (the previous Thursday). Monday daughter came home symptomatic. That’s true. US, family members mine eligible get far got JJ. Pfizer Moderna available, yes; didn’t get appointment them, got JJ. exactly I’m talking about. Pfizer Moderna available, shamed asked better wait get either two settle JJ. 

The hive mind would downvote insult anyone asking question. people got JJ.  Sssshhhh… you’re ruining narrative. Agreed ..hopefully stays way..you don’t need toxic hooligan like life.  people really see whole situation 'permission' behave worst self Lowkey, sip drink slowly 10 15 minutes savor sweet maskless time. also want much I'm dick. protection residents something power base American Samoa into.

unfortunately neither quite Americans. Refusal wear mask needs get banned life.   Well consequences removal flight, that's evidenced video. 

I find uncivilized. That’s pretty much exactly feel well.  \*nervously watching Florida get closer rearview mirror* Ready downvotes really problem restaurant owner choosing serve masked customers regardless reason they're masked. certainly agree feel like business right refuse money paying customers.  thankful that! “The flight plan filed agency doesn’t include antimaskers” *opens door*  Yeah, we’ve honestly contemplated it. wife daughter went Phillies game vaccine clinic. Unfortunately giving J&amp;J shot, 18+. would’ve hard lie. She’s months turning 12, really concerns getting 12. decide asshole is? person wearing ""fuck police"" tshirt? BLM shirt? collective responsibiity gang people whatever reason collective gang like?

I know; know act civil society.  Really? would 0.3% population dying single day!  article 2009 COVID 2021? isn’t even salient post. bring baby all! would control spread US?

The virus endemic, meaning cannot removed population. Even managed get point time 100% US population COVID soon let everyone houses transmission would begin again. virus would spread outside country back within month two we'd exactly before. That's effective strategy virus geographically constrained.. lock hard enough kill spread.

The R-value matters - rate spread within population. reduce R-value sorts ways - social distancing, masks, vaccines, outdoor activities vs indoor activities. That's flu comes back every winter - behavior changes increases R-value beyond 1.0 outbreaks begin occur. changes R-value end pandemic, temporary holing change equation. Dude/dudette, may well living house. 2 year old 2 month old. 2 year old increasing delays. We've bunch therapies coming along, we're hesitant send lot socialization activities due fear getting sick bringing anything home new baby. wife work hard balance find time work him. Everything I've seen recently 2-5 weeks 5-11.

Recently, however, started grouping 6mo-2 2-5. sure exactly means availability 2-5 year olds. get results? Nah would Robin Williams.  schools implementing test-to-stay policy regarding quarantine. possible exposure still come school normal quarantine period negative rapid antigen test every single day. 

They could something like vaccines. Get shot bear financial burden paying rapid test every school-day. 

It’s little harsh, gives people option aren’t going vaccinate helps reduce spread keep schools safe. Eh within one order magnitude (well first answer least)  child's risk long-term effects almost certainly higher get infected covid adverse reaction vaccine. thorough long-covid studies underway little know far, approx 2-4% kids symptomatic covid still deal symptoms 12 weeks infection. risk hospitalization low, still 1 100 kid gets infected, exactly anything brush off. comes kids, I'm crazy gambling health odds reasonably avoided masks vaccines. 

Critics covid restrictions often say much emotional trauma kids caused this, know what's *really traumatic*? trip hospital save kid's life. Try explaining 5 year old they're struggling breathe, bet go well.

So confident odds trip ER lower covid vaccine, might want wait see things play bit longer. us kept date fast delta spreading, low prevalence side effects vaccine, confident vaccine safer route, choosing get vaccinated era delta, basically choice get infected covid sooner later. sure correct. think ""stages"" ""phases"" refers age groups. think refers stage analysis. example, stage 1 might determining safe, stage 2 might determining dose, stage 3 might determining effective -- something like that.

Maybe somebody else chime correct I'm wrong

Edit: believe post correct kids divided 3 age groups. think ""stages"" clinical trial. didn’t know that. I’ve always told doctors 3 isn’t recommended. That’s started making sure got mine every year since niece nephew born. 100% agree understand saying. I'm also suffering empathy fatigue.. literally give shit anymore. mean, *is* significantly tragic lose 16 year old 86 year old. 

I would rather people ages die disease vaccine, correct lot people aren’t taking seriously that. I’ve read going come two waves. 2-4 shortly (fingers crossed) 6months-2 later year. agree risky (and risky preferences), since we've ended situation believe Denmark become interesting case study.

I really hope end like Texas also mysteriously low case load dropping restrictions suddenly flipped complete opposite. 

For I'm cautiously optimistic. Absolutely. Last year, MRNA vaccines new technology, manufacturing still spinning up, could widely released weeks earlier, might realistically saved 100,000 lives. was, get approved end cold flu holiday travel season, led directly massive death counts saw last winter.

The stakes nearly high kids, since are, average, less likely older people suffer major health effects, there's awkward necessary lesson learned regulatory system balances risk times true crisis. Caution cost much recklessness. Even flowwwwwww FWIW…. 4 1 year old recovered faster 31 29 year old. 

Little buggers better immune system apparently. moderna? Yep. too. world lost mind. Worrying side effects vaccine that’s developed tested whole boatload trained professionals versus effects catching, spreading, mutating virus that’s killed millions people. choose? confused disappointed humans. got three kids 1, 3, 5. yuuuge step right direction sanity. already know next year younger two though.  Wow quarantine change huge. everyone class basically one.  finally care anti vaxxers do.

It work like that. Probably major reason people care much. 80 year old dies? sad. 30 year old dies young family? It'd tragedy. Right wrong that's people's reaction. Great! 5-11 year old completes research, makes informed decision asks schedule appointment it, that. 
You know, it’s body choice. here. cannot wait get say ""YES!!!"" things again!  I'm lab (overnights), extra covid patients made workload suck too. commiserated phone last night one nurses (while calling yet another critical hemoglobin value), agreed unvaxxed covid cases making everything suck right now. least hospital turn anyone away, *yet*. many people wrong side history. still care know still going victims even younger kids able get vaccinated (like immunocompromised icu doctors, etc.), I’ve become lot passive lately whole pandemic, simply realize doesn’t matter say people anymore. 

There many people outside sphere influence, nothing left say convince them. Selfish assholes going selfish assholes. passive approach necessary mental health. wonder there'll different recommendation kids congenital heart defects reason happened. people, science, reason get past this.  God, parent 23 month old here. got take kid grocery store bunch 3 4 month old, then... nothing. FINALLY May June live felt safe again, then... fuck.

I'm ready take kid everywhere again. I’m assuming numbers catch covid, altogether right? 23% hospitalized would scary number. Even 8% Pfizer would be.   years Maine weather gonna like Virginia’s. kind breaking point anti-vaxxers. 

They filling hospitals, spreading disease - bringing us society. Ditto. I'm praying 2.5 year old least first shot Christmas 44000 / four hundred forty thousand. 
 
For future reference 
1Lakhs - one hundred thousand 
10 lakh - one million 
1 crore - 10 million 100 lakhs 
10 crore - 100 million anti maskers back too. Yh actually understand parents hesitant get child vaccinated covid since covid generally low risk them. mean obviously providing die hard anti vaxxer believes vaccines microchips lol. say rare risk heart inflammation reports we've seen understand. 

Might see massive rush parents vaccinate kids months go shown real world vaccines safe see parents(the ones vaccinated themselves) change mind get kids vaccinated. think alot parents want wait see rather dead set getting kids vaccinated. mean Phuket? /r/boneappleteeth vaccinate earth's animals since animal reservoirs likely means never goes away I’m parent several nieces age range. They’re excited get shot, want avoid getting sick want help protect sick grandpa can’t exposed covid.  It’s far basic. don’t give fuck anybody besides people know. doesn’t exist isn’t issue affects them. Right you!  couldn’t agree more!  underestimate many adults begrudgingly got vaccine could travel, go sporting events/concerts, it’s mandated work. Yep carousel awhile USA. Sometimes think it’s friends helping collect paychecks.  Hell would see doc he’d come back 2 weeks later forget even saw going on. Wouldn’t review notes anything. depressing  shit really frustrates contradictory annoying buzz phrase “they’re same, get whichever can” rage 6 months ago. 

People would get downvoted hell even asking difference, would able wait Pfizer/Moderna instead JJ. Appreciate   Isn’t clinical trials work? Pfizer pretty bias, said interested see FDA says review research. second gets emergency approval, 11 year old gonna first line. I’m exhausted worry non-masked school.  I'm sick hearing cases like this. information explicitly outlining steps take avoid getting Covid they, one loved ones get sick die, sudden change tune. top using resources another state could go one state's residents. I'm completely compassion. People like reason we're still neck deep pandemic. Nope. like ""holding extremely powerful standard all"" frustrating, like know booking flight they'd wear masks. think like Walmart wear it, really wear think one say anything?!?! dumbasses  


are fines interrupting delaying flight? it'd sure sweet justice lost ticket money pay extra.  Yup, conservative talking point now. They've used every batshit crazy explanation ""just wait 10 years, see!"". Wonderful news! saw stat heard 1 500 Americans died Covid, closer 1 380 Latinos. Community outreach especially family friends important want unvaxxed become vaxxed. people waiting hear official channels decided now, friends family influence left. registered kids trial weren’t selected. don’t know whether would gone it, would lots questions, interested. read article link said Halloween duct-taping incident, may favorite reaction type behavior. 3k people died 9/11 seem kind insignificant point. kept kid home kindergarten last year COVID homeschooling. went fine, struggled social person. made sure went 1st grade. kills little every day there, know it’s best mental health.

I told many times last 9 months vaccine ready kids, she’ll get it. worry that. I’ll keep one little quiet case something goes sideways, minute say ready, I’ll booking appointment her. still pass hospital may still miserable. 

I remain 'screw selfish assholes, please stay away' camp Damn, forgot We're eagerly waiting 2 year old newborn. We're hoping get booster soon provide protection breast milk.  Maybe Republicans finally come around universal healthcare.  one made wait sake unvacciainted COVID patient. hospital full show ER broken finger, rip vent COVID patient, let suffocate die free bed, give treatment broken finger. Exactly, buddy. Delta variant like apex speedster present future variants probably.  mean get we're getting well past point diminishing returns. Kids already almost risk. spread it, one shot vaccine helps little. protection 2 doses vaccine wane 6 months (still proven suspected), 1 shot going wane even faster. whole thing seems kind pointless guess parents screaming it. agree, ""Census Day"" April 1 2020, possibly worst time it. feel like ignoring stemmed from. Remember, vaccines much much better chance hospitalized someone unvaccinated.

This true, one part larger purpose provide source literally already did. CDC link references disease prevention. think need waste time finding source source taking herd immunity goal initially. adamant vaccines designed prevent infection? That's misinformation I'm trying push back on.

But since obstinate, here's another source. Note first bullet points emphasize disease prevention. Notably bullet points claiming vaccines sent indented prevent infection disease (yes know different). I'm sick people pushing vaccines intended prevent infection also reduce disease severity breakthroughs occur. That's chose respond. Thanks! cannot wait 10 month old get vaccinated (or she’s old enough). I’m tired trying weigh risks always questioning people vaccine status seeing her.  Exxxxxactly. extra steps making sure clean coming home outside stores FINALLY able relax bit 6 year old vaccinated.

I. Am. Excite. can't believe I'm going ask this, not? long time. I'm passed giving shit idiots think. let vaccinate kid already!  Current bedside nurses, please chime in!!!! I'm writing state reps, governor, members Congress president demand antivaxxers go back line hospital care ER's hospitals freed treating vaccinated people medical emergencies. could establish appropriate venues treating antivaxxers covid keep hospitals provide much care possible without depleting hospital resources.

My husband vaccinated get booster available. plan drive see relatives Christmas. Currently, hospitals state drive filled unvaccinated covid patients, transport excess patients places. There's way drive state hospitals filled up. get car accident? 

The unvaccinated chosen endanger us all. need last line emergency medical care get covid. NYC, Hispanic population ahead White population terms vaccination rates trailed year. Significantly too. 71% Hispanic adults gotten least 1st dose compared 60% White adults. Seriously, want able go work without worrying killing kid bringing something back. Enjoy no-fly list, assholes. think lot people know better do, listen them.

Have nice day. soon sort thing.

Rationed care toward unvaccinated. Nah. I'll stretch, exercise, pt works better surgeries anyway. covid advice, I'll see real physician.  Good question - says “at preventing COVID hospitalizations”, appears hospitalization (preventative) efficacy rate.

One thing remember - lot breakthrough case/hospitalizations older age brackets. Average age group 59+. Still quite rare

Also, data evolving Delta given time period study. FDA reviewing issue tons drugs. Guidance changed fairly recently asked drug manufacturers change production tolerances, recalls Meanwhile, think it’s fair say feel good stories never happened ECMO treatment uses external machine function body's heart lungs. **It used organ transplant patients, victims severe heart attacks** seriously ill Covid-19 patients -- including young adults. ""all beds taken Covid victims also getting ECMO treatment,"" Susan Walker said time.  48% fully vaccinated, according CDC data, brought case *very first day* flights Hawaii resumed. need step vaccination game turn Australia 2.0.

Yeah, soon mine vaccinated, things may skip indoor restaurants local case surges. Otherwise, we're going back normal. flipped meeting adults vaccinated HPV kids. seem fine. super excited kids never get Shingles, Chicken Pox vaxx. excited I've prevented getting least types cancer.

  Yea, turns country super high obesity rates also getting thrashed covid. wonder kids myocarditis result vaccine would far worse shape virus itself. myocarditis canary coal mine. tells kids likely would ended ICU worse COVID itself.  takes 3 weeks read data?  wonder percentage actually is. might close 49%, suspect it’s least points lower. Typically (not always) liberal families smaller families conservative families do. families know pretty liberal 1-2 due wanting work, environmental concerns, etc, many conservative families know 4-9 kids.

Thank kids, teachers deserve medal! (And raise) I’ve seen previous EUA decision generally 2.5 weeks data submission meeting another week meeting recommendation EUA. prepare documents give time public doctor review review meeting, CDC agree FDA.

So we’re looking late October submit last week September. Here's way think it, really hungry someone offers burger McDonalds (J&amp;J), wait healthy home cooked meal might dying hospital get it. Analysis paralysis people waiting specific vaccine much worse taking first available option.

6 months ago goal get people vaccinated vaccines significantly better nothing changed. goal started making vaccines 50% efficacy.

The CDC deals public health public health perspective primary goal still get first shots arms.  Man feel same. Try anti vaxxers family. aunt convinced us vaccinated drop dead. uncles wife refusing get vaccinated believes one big conspiracy theory depopulate world. can't even deal anymore. Way interconnected time, internationally locally. Traveling another state time rare unless commerce. Heck, traveling main street rare even kid. also society eat socialize home. 

Now cars, happy hour &amp; Target, society makes way easy virus spread.  understand that, unfortunate truth. meant you’re family getting vaccinated. :)  teacher teaching person since September 2020, also mother 6 year old 14 month old…I wait get kids vaccinated. worry every symptom since 6 year old schools day. Next up, Pfizer approves vaccine new borns virus 99% survival rate. Imagine thinking company set make millions selling vaccines anyone everyone care children. Oh My! true. Every time kids much sneeze, stomach flips. I've still got one five every vaccinated kid one less worry. Even though family telling us we're dangerously stupid know what, screw 'em.   pretty clear guidelines flu vaccines children.

AAP: ""The American Academy Pediatrics recommends healthy children 6 months older vaccinated influenza fall best protection flu,. . .""

CDC: ""Children younger 5 years old especially younger 2– higher risk developing serious flu-related complications.""

CDC: ""The best way prevent flu flu vaccine. CDC recommends everyone 6 months older get seasonal flu vaccine year, ideally end October."" I'm boat. thoughts different vaccines kids? moderna want kids get well also dont think wait months pfizer available first 235 pediatric patients across state Covid-- ""The numbers specify many total intensive care unit beds.""

Even number ICU specified them, even close to, 235 kids going fill childrens' ICU's across entire state Texas.

So say filling already full?  There's lot ... people... encouraging doubt fear helps aims. ""people"" apparently banned topic forum ""too political"" think know. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

I'm moderna gang recent news makes want kids moderna well. sure choice I'll make pfizer first feels like months kids get moderna. official number likely 2/3 actual dead well.

it likely end, either becoming mild endemic like spanish flu, eradication like smallpox, latter involve dragging less half billion troglodytes screaming kick across finish line. feel judgmental comment. pro vaccination COVID shots myself, absolutely feel comfortable giving vaccine children yet. long term affects don’t know yet, life half over, children. I’m sorry, much know yet. They'll eventually burn out

This, unfortunately reality, like OP said, daughter vaccine, breath sigh relief get life. give single fuck adult refuses get vaccine ends dead result, heart breaks children morons, folks like say, ""it is."" They'll burn eventually, rest us get life, we're old grey, tell stories grandchildren living unimaginably stupid time unimaginably stupid people. I'm sure question answered months possibly longer, received Pfizer JJ vaccine, permitted receive what's turning significantly better vaccine? 

Are currently trials ""doubling up"" vaccines happening? would part getting show road. Yh that's I've noticed amongst parents tbf kinda understand. Kids thankfully low risk covid. Guessing alot parents probably want wait see rare possible side effects pop myocarditis see rare is. parents change minds reckon parents even vaccinated lowest incidence serious complications amongst US vaccines higher efficacy Pfizer. researched vaccines trial results fact sheets chose vaccinated moderna felt like safest effective available vaccine. Speak lol, afraid vaccine *stay home*, remember? basically rest life. vaccinated indoors. safe, safe, whole point vaccines. Voting rights statehood popular among American Samoa exact reason

There that.  don’t want US constitutional protection apply either. Equal protection residents something power base American Samoa into.  One dozen different reasons.

If takes couple years burn out, much collateral damage do.

My immediate family lost sense taste, dad got PCR waiting results.

My folks stated thinking conspiracy make trumps vaccine bad, trump office flipped antivaxx.
He maskhole wash hands. grocery store couple days ago onset symptoms. I'm certain wear mask.

He fell asleep listening nutjob defending Ron Desantis.

My folks already vocally anti-booster somehow thinking absence information J&amp;J booster hanging dry.

They got J&amp;J got significant side effects. That's fallacious, right thing wrong reasons still win.

They've acting like dying last couple days.

Its like Olympic level cognitive dissonance. Well interesting mention measles, much transmissible covid. Measles actually reemerging people move anti vax direction.
 article ""Measles highly contagious—much COVID-19. contagious one person measles, 90 percent people close person immune also become infected.""

So respect herd immunity, seems imply consider transmissibility first foremost. measles vaccine, get lifelong immunity 97% protection life. reasonably high vaccination rates, measles rare. However, communities anti-vax movements taken place resurgence measles seen. places like Pacific Northwest lot antivax crazies, measles still make refuse get kids measles vaccine. measles outbreaks actually make news kids left brain damage deafness. last article look graph, look like measles making comeback, lot much larger time scale see covid.  reason believe antibodies 11 year old would effective antibodies say, 12 year old?

Seems that, given overwhelmingly safe, extrapolation effectiveness may warranted, given risk seems low... Yes, 25 50 consent papers. asked physician running last appointment dose (assuming vaccine) said went 50 dose finding portion trial. wonder many people fully vaccinated. case actually think better doses first doses. first 40-60% population gets vaccinated quickly, willing get one dose almost certainly going get second.

The real hurdle get rest population vaccinated. feel happy people separated partners loved ones least twenty months.

I personally Brits coming Vermont wedding 2022, whilst still long way off, lie: little nervous today. sorry suck. try reduce amount sucking replace better form sucking :)  would lost collective shit her.

Stanford/Yale recently well controlled study Bangladesh included nearly 350,000 people, conclusion that, yes, well fitted n95 best reducing chance getting Covid. 

But even ill-fitting cotton mask significantly reduces person's chance getting Covid.  Since 'Verified Specialist -PhD' suggest take look study.  ""The COVID-19 situation changing rapidly. Since disease caused new virus, vast majority people yet immunity it. Doctors scientists working estimate mortality rate COVID-19, present, thought substantially higher (possibly 10 times more) strains flu.""

What part makes think difference ""pretty minimal"" either kick threaten workers tenants, kick potentially harm others, there's win individuals, unless government make vaccine mandatory businesses tighten noose around unvaccinated people, happening  They're currently studies 0.5-4 year olds hoping available end year. want find caregiver kid stays home rest life?  Selective application religious principles tight! - guy Screen Rant's ""Pitch Meeting"" series, probably. Yeah worth noting CDC actually make rules. give ""guidelines"" different groups, people, etc. decide extent want follow them. Obviously CDC giving guideline vaccines something FDA takes consideration FDA approvals etc. Stop acting like aren’t high-risk kids. Plenty children danger suffering ill effects virus. 

My daughter getting monthly monoclonal antibody injections way whole world knew monoclonal antibodies - injections prevent RSV. respiratory virus, vaccine, incredibly dangerous congenital condition increases risk complications respiratory illness. 

I can’t wait get vaccinated, know it’s like afraid fall asleep, afraid won’t hear low-oxygen alarm, you’ll wake blue baby. constant stream anti-vax propaganda right past 8 months,

More kind 25ish years I’m hard time believing that, even unequal global vaccine distribution, elites haven’t vaccinated.

Glad NYS vaccine requirements entering restaurants spaces, someone immunocompromised get medical treatment far here, I’d happy online year. Traffic insane (even NYC) people taking cars public transport due coronavirus, bigger clusterf**k usual.

And Russia get f**ked opposition vaccine &amp; mask mandates. boat here. Soon friend.  Ironically idiots saying see, like flu! fair, blind spot enormous. know younger people hospitalized none died. 

People care hospitalizations, often severe covid leaves life long disabilities.

Kick outliers threaten safety people, worry whether home not?  Everyone's going get thing, need decide want protection vaccine not. think different ways could counter argument. 1% seems small, know pretty unlikely personally die covid, lot bad happen personally dying. take small number like 1% multiply large number, like population United States world, end big number, 3.3 million dead US, 70 million dead around world. Even though likely survive personally, really like idea single thing killing many people within years.

To make personal though, also think smaller scale people personally know. add number close family members family side wife's, including parents, siblings, nieces, nephews, grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins, easily get 100 people. Add friends, neighbors, coworkers, former classmates, former coworkers, acquaintances hobbies church, even familiar faces businesses frequent, bet people, really took time count many people know one way another, know well thousand people. 1% 1000 people know die, means 10 people know die, like idea either.

To look another way, 1% actually pretty high number comes risk aversion. day, average 30,000 commercial flights take place United States. 1% flights (300) crashed day, would feel safe flying? going sporting event stadium seats 20,000 people knew 200 going die, would still fell safe going?

Lastly, death worst outcome one get covid, hardly negative outcome. simply get mild cold, die. Many people end long-term effects range mild inconveniences like cough, way permanent damage vital organs severely impact quality life. Even people get admitted ICU make alive, part 99% survived. many walking away severely damaged hearts, lungs, kidneys. even make hospital relatively ok, doubt people would appreciate losing potentially weeks lives thousands dollars prolonged hospital visit. Bowser release Peach get vaccinated.  They're engaging performance art show libs they're going buckle horrible tyranny they're forced endure putting piece cloth faces protect fellow citizens. Permaban domestic carriers way go here. wonder much congregation upset saying this.

Depending church, many, all. church go to, probably well within mega-church size, proudly followed covid restrictions. seems norm area. normal churches make news, though, seems like churches crazy. Israel, country fully vaccinated rate 60s? 

Can't say I'm date Sweden, know went live strategy overall that's good argument vaccines. rate breakthrough infections around 0.1-0.5% 1-5 1000. So, yes, get it, rare.  US population 1918 103 million, compared 330+ million currently. means 1918 flu pandemic still deadly per capita, although undercounting ongoing infections, may prove pretty similar end.

bruh. perpetual victimhood mentality must apply black people. Nothing ever fault individual more. 

This mentality works something like cyclical poverty that's real phenomenon that's legitimately extremely complicated difficult get of, vaccines available everyone time. There's poverty vaccine access. Everyone go get vaccinated time, responsibility so. People need stop making excuses extremely bad choices result spread COVID. deadly virus.  result warrants going arrest? make federal system then? IANAL, obv, anyone familiar law chime this? California’s battle variants Epsilon taking early lead, Alpha kicking ass, Delta destroying Risk may small vaccine available happy it. community vaccine rate 40% risk small make much sense testing younger age groups it? May well try vaccinate many people possible. Bible that? really is. theyre proud awful group vulnerable. I'm sure they're working it, also group careful with.

Vaccinating older siblings, daycares, etc.. help. Holy shit that's blast past. want see real horror show, go read last ten tweets. 80 year old either, 36-year-old guy. Get vaccinated well might long, miserable, painful death.

One nurses flight posted month   People want lower risk kids becoming seriously ill dying. Also people would like kids able go school two weeks row without pull due another outbreak. Also everyone concerned 12+ hour waits ICU beds.  fear unreasonable. Try keep calm. vaccinations protect scenario, already unlikely infect you.  120 days 2nd dose, yes. didn’t see anything boosters. Despite impressive rising case numbers, 5-11 group always lowest per capita hospitalization rate. 

The 0-4 age group, hand, currently lowest per capita case numbers age group (outside highly vaccinated 65+ group) consistently lowest per capita cases age groups children. Sadly, 0-4 group also consistently highest per capita hospitalization rates age groups children. 1 50 cases require hospitalization 0-4 age group - it’s closer 1 450 5-11 group.

Many fellow Americans ashamed selfish behavior pandemic. Many state governments corporations also ashamed greed &amp; lack empathy crisis. believe evolved strain could cause very, over-reactive immune response younger people, esp. So, basically drowned mucus. would double check Wikipedia starters though. But, yes, stories sick evening, dead morning. small chance child gets sick covid. Seasonal flu shot something consider instead. easier understand multiplier. 77% effective means 4x less likely hospitalized compared unvaccinated people; 92% effective means 12x less likely. Unfortunately people never want get rid them, expect become big public policy fight near future. Yeah, pretty dumb part. gotta take mask eat one else walking wear one... risk avoided vaccine made available. understand risk death low, risk lessened would jump opportunity. sure people voting expressing concern child's safety. Super weird

(Also, try social-distancing sometime... actually also works - farther away, better.)  T-cells still too, one group kills infected cells, reducing virus' ability propagate.  
There's metabolic cost maintaining high circulating antibodies, plus every pathogen we've encountered blood would thick flow. point think jury still quickly much protection infection symptomatic disease wanes. conflicting data confounding variables, think whole booster thing (other immune-compromised, really booster enhanced primary vaccination regimen) little premature. isn’t EUA useful start giving vaccine 5-12 year olds risk groups (cancer patients, transplanted patients)?

Yeah, tough choice. Globally, trend pretty clear last 2-3 simply don’t know. vaccine new(ish) technology, mRNA vaccine used spike protein before, could wind dangerous long run. One long term side effect hope immunity COVID. you’re go route long term effects vaccine there’s one.

she hospital caution. stupid assume ended covid.   I'm glad got vaccinated; means chances survival far greater. Thank you, OP, including diacritics actually read Vietnamese words! man argument

Never heard it. mean ""straw man"" argument?  Denmark open possibility shutting winter cases go much. always balance restrictions hospitalizations, right make sense lot restrictions there. Tourists. looks like US getting rid country-based bans starting early Nov, instead requiring visitors fully vaccinated *and* take test least 3 days prior arrival.

Question!

Does anyone know required vaccines allow vaccines approved US? Sputnik, Sinovax, etc. family access Pfizer, Moderna, J&amp;J, I'm hoping policy allows full vaccination vaccines.

Thanks! that's good hear. Unbelievable amount lobbying* never said vaccinated spread faster aren’t. would appreciate didn’t lie put words mouth. 

Perhaps people followed rules platforms they’re participating wouldn’t banned would they? don’t think you’re fully aware toxic anti vaccine netizens are. 

Perhaps people shouldn’t keep posting things proven false. Perhaps people cognizant terms conditions social media platforms. dropped family members too. espouse hateful, willfully ignorant views public platforms, aren’t influence want children’s lives. here. Some? eyeballing it, seems like two oldest categories much smaller dip groups dropped lot.

It fully explain seeing increase deaths, could partly explain dropped. Nice strawman. take lot time make it? confusing population growth general extremely high birth rates resulting skyrocketing population growth overabundance children. They're thing.  received notification replying comment, checked reddit mobile, gone. comment made directly comment, included originally replied - person vaccinated family not.

I attack person replied me. person attacked like now. explained circumstance include every single detail vaccine comment mine warrant that. push things specifically talking one part. 

You set dying hill vaccines primary priority reduced transmission. went offence sources end called information CDC misinformation. 

The problem saying said misinformation. Even though sources backing agreeing sources. going call misinformation, provide sources ass it. 

This time waster me, talking pointless.  Can't school nurses start giving vaccines? parents sign permission slip. Ready 2 little ones get vaccinated. Sick worrying slip get comfortable Wow, really 'almost'. time writing, Worldometer gives deathcount 692,012, Google queried 'Washington DC' gives population count 692,683. Interesting article claims ""robust immune response"" however, FDA currently recommended testing antibodies following mRNA covid vaccine. exactly effectiveness/immunity measured? Would even soluble? Hint; yet. What’s long term effects vaccine? LOL  Seatbelts don’t long term effects, LOL. again, still catch spread COVID even you’re vaccinated. thing vaccine improve ability fight virus. I.E. decreases severity case.  Yes they've done models estimate total infections, still majority.

And act like boost get breakthrough, that's small portion carries substantial risk, even young. Vaccines cut risk long covid half, still there. Here’s comes to. Covid forever. intend mask isolate forever? so, avoid gathering. think ever point act normally, else think it’d group comprising solely fully vaccinated individuals. fair, though, really apples apples comparison. Spanish flu killed many people despite population world much smaller.

This undermine amount loss COVID-19, highlight truly *devastating* Spanish flu was. also take account things like age stratification, effects WWI, etc. Thank nice. regrets here!  People love act like 1% (or even smaller) many people, except context we're in, significant amounts people. can't remember many dozens times read statistic quoted percentage people die COVID, ""it's totally blown proportion"". Currently, worldwide, ""only"" 0.02% people died COVID, 4.7 million people. people act like that's nothing? ignorant incredibly disrespectful many levels. counter anti Vaxxers say death rate 1% covid? what's deal booster shots now? got 2 Pfizer doses back February. seems though FDA approving boosters 65 health conditions Pfizer, also seems like efficacy vaccine slips fairly significant margin 4 months. Originally talking boosters 8 months would October me, seems like might stuck have. option additional protection us going hope best?

I’m angry. people Georgia would get vaccinated, may gotten :( every child get car accident, still wear seatbelt. Covid keeps spreading they’ll prone long term effects too.  Makes sense, thanks. sure spout stuff would roll eyes at, certainly can't judge genes! hope regret answering.  logic, vaccinated people vaccinated protect COVID still get COVID spread faster unvaccinated. anyone says otherwise isn’t actually “censored” accounts shut down, suspended, banned participating activities, etc. What? coincidence?

It’s kid. I’m going what’s absolutely best them. End story. 

Take self righteous attitude elsewhere. Cases per 100.000 age group 80+ peaked 2 weeks ago. 65-79 one week that. 

 
Looking cases age group Denmark two waves summer:

Ages 16-39 peaked already week 28 steep rise UEFA championship. 

All age groups increased slowly peaked 5-7 weeks later:   far off. works well ELI5 version. every single child catch COVID. vaccines get mandated, every single child would prone long term effects vaccine. never made argument kids couldn’t spread it. know even vaccinated people still spread virus, sort invalidates point there. Notice Denmark 95%+ 50+ age group. That's far important 12+ age group terms hospitalizations deaths. news dog get covid 19 shot? Government going put mandate? feel like Anti Vax even Vax people allowed pets give shot.

You mean Distemper? Rabies? course first places target weakest least able fight back are.

They cowards plain simple. understand reasoning parents actions. matter article?
It literally say ""people kicked wearing masks"" Yeah don’t like part either, figured way schools would able pay it. don’t know much schools pay test, bought BinaxNOW rapid tests $14 two. That’s $7 day average school year 180 days; schools can’t afford paper copy machine, certainly can’t afford $1260 per year per student COVID tests. fair, 48% first known case, able quarantine entire flight, probably better countries.  way read comply employee specifically approached them, sign door. employee stop risk altercation enforce rule make. Well, half population take Leeeeeeroy Jenkins! approach pandemic management, things might look little better right now, nope. can't nice things. local story done said parents went restaurant friends. never explicitly says whether kid way couple talks needing break new parents makes think left kid home believe you. big country; things look weird.

Meanwhile, know least seven (probably nine) people who've COVID. None hospitalized; none treatment aside resting; one lingering issues. They've told one person who's died it, died China. I'm also feeling weird reading stories people who're somehow filling hospitals this. Bring back Pillory! Pandemic solidified one thing me. group states never visit miss want break float away sea. sound like someone might well placed answer this, US (or states) getting point two parallel economy's, groups wont interact?

If so, see worse case this? covid fade point, im sure press ""interested parties"" find new tool keep division alive.

Where see endgame being?   Probably symbolic 9/11 was: main targets symbols US economic (Twin Towers), military (The Pentagon) political (Capitol Hill, though one diverted PA) powers. Maybe alot people would take virus seriously would see kind infection face sorts. Vanity important US. condolences lost someone. Mask up, get vaccinated fuck sakes already!  Vaccines like lifting truck, going guarantee annoying traffic definitely help out!

They like Gadsden flag window decal, going let *everyone* know insufferable ignorant history, let *a lot* people know.

Also, think unfair article use total deaths measure deadliness instead basing population. undermines far we've come medicine.

Also, everyone works healthcare. Also, everyone job puts high. What's mean? knows! forget immunocompromised, need booster even Moderna!""

Good fucking luck. Honestly dumb hope FDA points meaningless distinction 90% population rest harmful confusion opens everyone 6 months 2nd shot.  78. masks related vaccinated numbers full hospitals filled unvaccinated people, mostly adults. Getting kids vaccinated help numbers immediately. ahh, others. Well, already knew idiot. applaud this.   know 5 people covid. That’s awfully low number. 3 went hospital. 

Let put way, birthday party Saturday 20-25 people. None covid also barely know anyone it. 

I’m saying it’s hoax anything, sharing experience. It’s rare circle, it’s nuts I’m seeing young people going hospital (and possibly succumb) this.

Can’t live fear something almost risk them. say vaccinated parent 2 kids  you? need wake up? pun intended apparently!

Nice catch! Pfizer's vaccine show drop antibody adults 6-8 months vaccination? seems like vaccine side effect helps little

If cuts transmission 50% mortality 90% group going cut mortality insignificant levels lot reduce overall rates spread. Ha, sorry, wasn’t trying cryptic. thought playing “unless afford fly” using money-related reference! kids? want kid 0.01%?

Parents don’t want kid die say “well little one died it’s ok part 0.01%”

I mean common sense? hospitalized, 3000 less start weekend.

One vaccine might slightly effective another, would suggest getting first one available vaccine still better none. Holding case effective vaccine time child spends unvaccinated. Today's phase 2+ data Pfizer 5-11 quite good. 1/3 dose (10 micrograms, 1/10 moderna's dose) gives high measurable immunity quite reasonably low side effects (no myocarditis issues thousands participants).   Whenever want. places really enforcing them.

Seriously, boggles mind people willing pay commit felony avoid free vaccine literally reduces chances dying disease killed millions around world.  However every person gets direct contact covid reaches viral load high enough considered infected, even without covid 19 antibodies. 

What quite certain everyone exposed covid, contracting another story.

Edited word. Lol. Right on. Remember went war 20 years less 10k? Yeah, too. Regional demographics incredibly different across US. includes political affiliation education level (which correlate strongly vaccination rates other), also age demographics. Google Cytokine storm. Happens COVID too, medicine prevent it. anti smoking drug Pfizer FDA told us perfectly safe turns giving people  There's currently BLM protest hostess outside restaurant, wonder coerced drop charges started taking two (almost three!) year old twins stores summer showed us able keep masks on. They’d stores restaurants pandemic young remember. used act wild place took new them, think they’re getting used it.  lot recent studies state peak viral loads Delta variant similar vaccinated unvaccinated relying PCR testing proxy viral load. PCR works first breaking viral cellular material soup free floating pieces. add molecule binds certain sequence RNA that's unique virus, molecule also contains marker fluoresces exposed certain type light. number test cycles required detect positive fluorescent signal tells us concentration viral RNA test (fewer cycles \[Ct-values\] means higher viral RNA concentration).  
 
The problem test know state viral RNA rendered soup. using proxy viral load they're assuming RNA came whole virus capable infecting another person.  vaccinated people (and previous infection) mount defense virus much earlier much vigorously unvaccinated people naive immune systems. line expect higher percentage PCR-detected viral RNA might come virons coated antibodies rendered inactive, debris virus deactivated destroyed active immune response. 
So would give us clear answer following PCR testing Culturing; taking part sample culturing see much virus grow certain amount time since truly infectious whole virus replicate. recent study that's pre-print right exactly that: 
 
They found that: ""As probability culture positivity depends viral load, corrected using probit regression model viral load vaccination status predictors. Figure 1C shows probability positive culture given viral load vaccinated unvaccinated HCWs. positive vaccination status significantly decreased probability culture positivity (p = 0.002, Wald test).""  
 
So looking deeper narrative vaccinated produce maximum infectious viral load unvaccinated may stand scrutiny. Yeah. ended going ahead getting second. second time around better first additional chest pain already had. low grade fever 101 felt achy, within 24 hours fever gone took ibuprofen couple hours getting 2nd shot. I'm 90% better now. still feel little chest tightness I'm able work lift fine now. I'm pretty sure got costochondritis vaccine take time go away completely. tests done. nothing wrong find. chalked immune systems response vaccine caused inflammation chest. Hope helps. harmful ANYONE vaccinated, everyone know now.

Your friends dumb getting vaccine.  least country, 2 weeks second shot meant could infected second shot develop symptoms later, status exempt testing, needed 2 weeks second dose incubation purposes actual immunity.  Good mormons support vaccination. agree.

Pfizer needs write study, legitimately takes time. (My dad works writing clinical trials; important work.) delay FDA's fault. real work too, looking initial EUA last year, going anywhere near quickly could've should've. Wow, means 2 half years live? Congress get shots. miss change. yep, is... (1) endemic, (2) preventable ""right"" idiot decline vaccine. do, others right avoid around you. Delta much infectious, spread much faster easier among unvaccinated. also issue waning efficacy time, may start play role stage pandemic. spread happening vaccinated people now, seems like majority cases still unvaccinated people. many ways, yes, (1) endemic, (2) preventable damnedifyoudo-damnedifyoudont situation agree, point focus people hospitals help people actively refused get vaccinated people everything right? chance right thing refused. Let lay bed made. Pfizer rep said they're hoping vaccines available 5 11 year olds Halloween, maybe early November...

That ASAP :(

Even advanced age, admire restraint permits people go along, get going, matter takes. right stuff situation. necessarily liberal, affluent initially spread newsgroups. exactly partisan issue. numbers still low, meaning difficult get good statistics it, actually fairly good idea cause. followed Danish media early Sept., quite bit talk increasing rates people nursing homes, also clearly visible SSI's data. example, week 32 (mid-Aug), 12 covid cases among nursing home residents, breakthroughs. Vaccines good perfect one expect breakthroughs, there's increase likely reduced protection. week 36 (early Sept), almost four times many week 32, breakthroughs. increase among old people, especially particularly vulnerable, seen hospitalization rates, too. oldest age category data provided 90+ years. entire August, 10 new hospitalizations group. We're slightly less three weeks September almost 20 new hospitalizations age group. similar trend seen 80-89 years. Nursing home residents first group vaccinated (almost finished February; ~8 months ago), they've keeping eye reduced effect vaccine. appears began happening month ago. That's began giving boosters nursing home residents (along particularly vulnerable people) earlier month. However, like ""main"" vaccine shots, likely takes couple weeks booster shot full effect. data still limited say certain, indications we're starting see effect. last full week (14-20 Sept), 16 deaths. week (7-13 Sept), 22 deaths. means last week first week two months clear decrease deaths, compared week directly it.

The authorities already said they're expecting boosters people suspect we'll see old people general (not nursing home residents particularly vulnerable people) 2021. younger people doubt it'll happen 2021 they're less vulnerable disease last vaccinated.  Almost certainly means measure 1 month second dose. super unlikely younger immune systems respond doses slowly. [The press say anything more.  Wtf?!

Also anaphylaxis also pretty rare easily treatable. stay ~15 minutes observation. Yes, vaccinated people still spread COVID, still evidence vaccine helps stop spread, even delta variant. Denmark 75% vaccinated rate case numbers looking good. open now. Right many ICUs US nearly full unvaccinated people. effect vaccinated people non-COVID emergencies.  take drug manufacturer FDA tell perfectly safe, gives cancer.

Then ask trust again. think overall numbers far apart, AIDS toll U.S. upward 700,000 Covid toll approaching. difference, course, AIDS epidemic 40 years old, first recorded Covid case U.S. ""only"" 20 months ago today.

Note also that, U.S. Covid epidemic far, number people infected SARS-CoV-2 *every day* several times average number people infected HIV *year*. Also, average, Covid killed many Americans two weeks AIDS kills year. Right, clarify pfizer vaccine seemed incredibly safe well. sure AZ available country (US)     propaganda scientific evidence year twice year lot differently daily. It’s world difference.

Furthermore, mRNA extremely fragile, breaks body long it’s introduced.

It’s honestly display ignorance you’re afraid injection 100s millions people taken safely. sure downvoted, appreciate response. think anecdotal experience lines “know” far

Here’s another question I’ve can’t seem get good answer to

In many areas, hearing hospitals overloaded time pandemic. seems counter-intuitive me, higher vaccination rate ever, therefore pool unvaccinated smaller, therefore pool potential hospitalizations smaller. seems must phenomenon play would explain hospitals overloaded ever despite plurality population vaccinated. 

In experience see reason this? sensible explanation seems surge coinciding major worker shortages hospitals, would think would part narrative case. Siblings friends. they’re also stereotype people won’t get vaccine. Think American flags flying back trucks. morons can't help moron hard can.  I'm sorry wife, hope sees recovery   month, Dr. Rashid Buttar posted Twitter COVID-19 “was planned operation” shared article alleging people got vaccinated coronavirus would dead 2025. 
His tweets recent addition steady stream spurious claims COVID-19 vaccines treatments. Another example Dr. Sherri Jane Tenpenny’s June testimony, Ohio state legislators, vaccine could cause people become magnetized. Clips hearing went viral internet. Earlier pandemic, April 9, 2020, Dr. Joseph Mercola posted video whether hydrogen peroxide could treat coronavirus; shared 4,600 times. video, Mercola said inhaling hydrogen peroxide nebulizer could prevent cure COVID-19.

Doctors spread vaccine misinformation violating Hippocratic Oath. lose license practice medicine.   lead paragraphs:

VATICAN CITY, Sept 20 (Reuters) - health certificate showing proof immunity COVID-19 required enter Vatican Oct. 1, city state said Monday.

Residents, workers visitors carry co-called ""Green Pass"" already widely used surrounding Italy, Holy See said statement.   people taught think critically understand context. know ""1"" super-duper low number can't bad.  Yeah, definitely basing decisions YouTube videos made non-medical people. time, even though ceiling low, questions asking walking something like this. 

The problem questioning vilified. absolutely unacceptable consider anything less hospitalization worth trying prevent. They're finding sorts damage cases asymptomatic need hospital, vaccines cut long covid risk 50% so.

People keep mind they're touting panel ostensibly ""following science""... They're ""following science"" hospitalizations, care risks ""mild"" covid might reach different conclusion.  Anti vaxxers anti maskers idea unpopular hated are. Especially small closed spaces. think freedom patriot heroes, majority sense hope get fired thrown planes. Ye olde newt blood letting next... would better let cards get Texas surveilled everyone buying could arrest too. No, combo masks, vaccines, people surviving infection developing natural resistance drops rate community spread safe levels, protective stuff anymore. Maybe occasional booster shot. covid's control really like flu, quite dangerous vulnerable populations society-wide threat. Heck yeah (kids 3 5) - give kids vaccine NOW. don’t want household’s problem anymore. Depends local state laws, well company policy. blanket federal protection aware of. 

This assuming United States. thought so. list: sure Canada, US totally far right. I’ve hearing “Obama’s family doesn’t get flu shots everyone else” years. part anti-establishment conspiracy longest.  separate trial data approval expected end year.   Reduce spread community schools. Continue increase percentage population fully vaccinated hopefully able go back normal restrictions, despite anti vaxxers best efforts. Also, assurance schools able stay open person learning.

It's community whole, individual. even that, would much rather son exposed covid vaccinated not. hope daughter ok now. I'm sorry hard time. common vaccines would interact differently children vs adults? human, cells work virtually right? understand concerned proper dose type chemical based medications I'm confused assumed default results children would differ adults literally cell instructions creating blank protein certain shape.

Or everything medicine default separated Adult, Child, Pregnant, etc groups one always tested separately matter what? Seems thorough sure redundant cases IMO. I'll right behind Bots/trolls.  measures seem strict (mandatory quarantine vaccinated arrivals) guess island never Covid better ensure never reaches general population. would contradict mask recommendations schools doubtful. would hard justify recommendation kids low risk enough vaccinated. fear-mongering pearl clutching already happening sites like Facebook. latest craziness life-saving products “brain poisons” effect developing brain. Makes kids angry depressed. Caffeine glucose also impact developing brains intelligent person calls “brain poisons”. agree hospitals ok area. Masks low cost mitigation aren’t zero cost child’s development.    way.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Thanks. Yes see point one people arguing precautions. guess I'm fairly lucky living area done pretty much done. 

Thus, I'm wondering legitimately end looks like, folks give really great answers above. think kids able vaccinated also low transmission rates. likely see masking (which think wise) mandates place spikes occur. saying France cannot buy vaccines favorite ""tell us something special yourself"" icebreaker last person tune, clean, jam Johnny Cash's guitar collection went auction. Although could avoided getting vaccine, I'm glad die. would like hear theses people needed tragedy health care officials pleading for. media, warped religious view, plain ignorance proven facts? seems like issues need addressed civilization death cycle forever, last virus threatening issue face. Oh yeah, fully expect happen. eager lining shots like new iPhone.  
The eager, REEEE loud possibly talking points vaccine FDA “Approved”.  
Lots VARES, Myocarditis, natural immunity, children don’t get sick, etc…. gets FDA approved, public schools able require Covid vaccine students? difference delta change modified vaccine though, benefit structural cleavage spike related bodies immune response upon infection. TLDR delta actually evade vaccine all, better infecting cells. Hmmm. don’t see “selective interpretation”. feel like two perfect agreement, working different ends towards middle ground.

OP’s questions flipped versions explanations Israel saw many vaccinated people hospitalised (more number unvaccinated people!).  OP trying figure person saw (zero!) fully vaccinated people.

Most places (at moment) would somewhere middle two extremes.

Geographic location could explain via low local take-up vaccines, low number cases general, comparative recency vaccine access.  Working vents might explain it. don’t see milder breakthrough cases serious breakthrough cases often going underlying factor (age comorbidity) explains severity means they’d directed towards hospice-style care rather extreme interventions.

It’s explanatory context, we’ve got Israel, person claiming zero fully vaccinated cases. Hell yes! bad vaccine didnt work (like many others). said got vaccinated months ago Jimmy falen. article paywalled Washington Post. 

It called (after name paper): /business/2021/09/18/covid-hospital-bills-insurance-deductible/ mistake!

It pretty clear [deaths slowly even still rather small numbers 0-5 per day. 

But looks like [follows case delay.   Shit like makes feel like I’m losing mind. see whit flags, somewhere back mind know 1 5 people country think pandemic hoax. It’s surreal. It’s like gaslit time. Wonderful news! 5 year old started kindergarten year want safe possible. Hopefully means expedient review FDA allows emergency use within month!   think many parents eager child first group. They'll let eager parents vaccinate kids first done significant side effects found.

Personally I'm getting kid vaccinated ASAP, I'm absolutely done Covid want able indoor playdates again. Yeah posting works. Thankyou.gif    Families signed site nearest us 100 slots allocated them. posting link That's probably accurate timeline.  That’s posted text article. wouldn’t let post proper URL used one pay wall Apple news, made delete post. trouble re-posting said link already used. Sorry fault long completely ignore breakthrough cases, pretty common point. 

You ignore breakthrough cases. overwhelmingly mild, leading hospitalization would think asthma major risk factor condition affects lungs.

""I would think"" substitute actual studies. Asthma major risk factor covid. 25 million people 5-12 US. 

At 1/25,000, that's 1,000 cases. 

It's usually mild resolves without treatment. 

It's common virus vaccine.

The vaccine makes much sense, feel way, it?

Do parents think virus risky less risky vaccine?

We've done bad job responding idea ""kids get severe cases"". got tons worse 1/25,000, right? would pretty surprised see mandates children anytime next 6 months. Maybe time next school year. Yes, Moderna dose staging phase kidCove Trail. 25 50 mcg doses. case: data hasn’t reviewed FDA yet — it’s yet *approved*. Yup. like teen age group, think loudest voices want kids vaccinated...but surge quickly trail off. Alternative title: cluster Floridians require one personally dramatically affected act other's best interests. Shocking! count herd immunity though? I've heard term prior covid reference diseases nearly extinct, like measles. state California (40 million) getting hundred measles cases day would longer claiming heard immunity. love optimistic dream. don’t believe it’s ever going happen country - they’ve sold idea anything common good “communism”. Well fell, burning ring fire. Like smeagol I'm relieved hear results good official source.

And hopefully good 2-5 year old results far behind... mandates deal rest.

We can't live like forever. 2500 expanded number. Original trial 1500 children 5 11. Sounds like well. Keep it.

While know masks prevent spread getting infected, point gotta can. Regardless lower age set whether 2 5.  pro-coviders there.

Can't wait get vaccinated protect least family. would love too. ex-wife way. already said discussion. 


I know right. parents separated, lawyer decide. Guess going court? 


It's discussion atm. EU get green light, I'm ASAP.   acted covid ""a little flu"" since beginning, adherent safety protocols obliged to, promoted took part large crowds unmasked. pretty much example behave pandemic. TLDR:

Pfizer efficacy starts wane tad quickly Moderna (starts show 4 months).

They’re evaluating dosage size (100 micrograms Moderna 30 micrograms Pfizer), timing doses Modernas higher production antibodies potential drivers - updated science come uncover more. Could tie recos boosters future.

“When focused specifically period 120 days beyond second dose, study authors found Moderna vaccine remained 92% effective preventing COVID-19 hospitalizations. equivalent figure Pfizer vaccine 77%.“ Maybe push universal healthcare? tried nothing ideas.  6 months

-the FDA, probably. recent poll saw said 49% parents plan give kid vaccine. means even vaccinated people reluctant. definitely interesting see plays guess unless schools mandate won’t see overwhelming rush give kids. 

Just like adults, probably surge vaccinations eager group parents quickly stall.  Supposedly sometime 4th quarter! fingers crossed. person actually clicked link? hell getting upvoted without proper url? infuriating people dying bc they're clogging hospital beds. local hospital near capacity. There's 50 unvaxxed people taking beds ten currently dying speak.  definitely interesting see plays guess unless schools mandate won’t see overwhelming rush give kids.

Schools mandate participation winter sports, parents want kids get good colleges capitulate. Another way exclude less privileged people entering country. let get straight. go get vaccine booster, still get sick still spread it.

In case sincere, here's sincere answer:

The vaccine reduced viral load vaccinated folks Delta. looks like Delta transmit freely either group, though studies still new, we're learning go.

There's actual debate though whether vaccine drastically reduces changes serious outcomes infection. That's settled science point, even Delta. 

So, stay unvac'd – transmit realistic possibility bad outcome Covid infection — vaccinate probably still transmit some, making infection mild almost cases. Breakthru cases vaccine injuries incredibly small numbers compared unvaccinated deaths. 

I hope get vaccinated, us should. 5 year old soon available. Cheers. Shame you! Fellow mom 2 2. hard. I'm excited seems hope horizon. I've trapped home trying entertain, educate, keep home going without breaks, adventures silly luxuries (I want go target, think would blow 18 month olds mind!).

I want worry less anti vaxxers finally take kids somewhere!  Looking Louisiana schools, favors sending anyway.  Don’t say 2500, spreads false info I'm sensing trend. ""Vaccines better infection"". ""Vaccines good infection"". noticed modeling University College London (UCL) based years immunity infection. evidence ivermectin provides benefit passed steroid use. Ivermectin acts anti inflammatory acts somewhat similarly steroids capacity - except effective, side effects serious toxicity. currently evidence works combined steroids. reason Ivermectin approved poorer countries countries may great access dexamethasone.

When claim ivermectin criticism due people “living bubble” shows bias data actually shows.  People understand low individual risk necessarily imply low societal risk. example: chuck cigarette butts highway there's low risk anything happening. everyone chucks cigarette butt wildfires guaranteed deal issue regardless individual odds contribution overall probability. I'd almost get popcorn ready watch shitshow except we're seeing happen often making sick stomach. :( 
Like watching slow motion train wreck *could* stopped (or slowed down?) many people trying best let continue happen bad way possible.. Libraries great. Never early show kids great books are. miss taking grandkids there. weird numbers presented. would seem like 210M people fully vaccinated, 400M received one dose. shouldn’t asking anyone “sacrifice themselves”. 

Trust studies? article Pfizer rep commenting data hasn’t even released scientists review yet. 

Pfizer stands make 5 billion single round vaccine. Yes. I’m skeptical tell me. learned nothing nature pharma companies? FWIW, 12 17 year old kids allowed get vaccinated time.  child front line. I’m sick terrified they’ll get covid. 

Sign vaccine sooner rather later please. RemindMe! 10 Years ""Am part class action suit Moderna"" kids getting first day. It’s absolutely batshit insane we’re debating this. GOOD. be, now, yet. Can't wait get 2 youngest kids vaccinated. nice hear. Congrats upcoming baby!!

I birthed 2 kids *during* pandemic. taken semblance normal motherhood away me. I've basically house arrest since March 2020 (when first). 

I'm ready vaccinate kids care less anti vaxxers. toddler never gone anywhere beyond doctors appointments, I'm excited show world beyond that.

Being pandemic mom hard. Hopefully see news 6monthers, experience less shitty trapped home baby vibes.  know. really messed people care about, job-wise also made plenty sick. One spent 2 weeks hospital. fault unvaccinated people county. around us.  Can’t come soon enough. almost 4. She’s special needs can’t wear mask, I’ll feel much better she’s got layer protection. elephant could fall today. children’s school already gives kids 12 45 days 12th birthday fully vaccinated excluded school activities. already said mandate vaccination pupils vaccine approved kids 5. test unvaccinated kids school weekly PCR test need clear attend. staff adults campus vaccinated. eat distanced school built new facilities allow that. Kids allowed remote don’t want person every classroom refitted air purifiers screens keep people apart.

I still desperate get kids shot.  Pharmacies area vaccinate 7rs. sucks. following science agrees position?  Kind juvenile part passengers.

I working inpatient wards December-February, pretty much peak hospitalization season state. classic story ""COVID hospitalization.""


Kid suicidal, comes ED. Social work tries place inpatient psych, need negative COVID test first. Whoops! They're COVID+. need sit hospital 10 days going inpatient psych. I'm kidding say 50% COVID admissions. ~10% MIS-C, 10% kids acute hypoxic respiratory failure, 30% kids reasons happened test positive. 



With said, experience hospitals nearly volume Texas now. really can't speak severe illness kids there. Could they're seeing lot kids respiratory failure, I'm sure obesity rates helping that. Okay, say 1/10th assumed, that's still 25x risk hospitalization vs myocarditis (at all, hospitalizing myocarditis, present all). I’m coming pretty close wearing masks even “mandated” unless someone specifically tells too, like employee something, especially since news broke won’t getting booster anytime soon.

- 96m Pfizer

SK purchased enough doses fell behind priority compared countries US, bought ahead vaccine-hopefuls-then.

Pfizer vaccines delivered SK punctually vaccines not. First, AZ meet schedule EU countries India began controll vaccine exports AZ vaccines manufactured SK go abroad instead. Then, Moderna brorke agreement SK supply vaccines 2Q, US exercised purchase option stock vaccines warehouse. quite recently, Moderna kept delaying vaccine deliveries frequently, kept holding SK's vaccination campaign back.

But vaccine supply improving, ratio full vaccination reach 70% late October. talking FDA approval? Look history FDA approved drugs pulled long term findings. Warmer ocean surface temperatures cause extreme snowstorms blizzards, less. read Pfizer (mine) efficacy 6 months reduces 77%, J&amp;J seems holding near original efficacy 6 months.  one, infuriated.

If point, contract covid, entirely fault covidiots. Let us hope cross border trade still permitted. Proof ownership: ""Sir, look wife."" analogy think someone saying can't cut gangrenous left hand 'then would still able work?' mind set.  No, ignore going travel arm rest body.... 

So. Foolish. :( feel like lot people knew said ""Well 'I' take vaccine right comes out. need wait studies done"" still fighting tooth nail secure one vaccine availabilities first announced.

On paper public people might want seem cautiously optimistic, push comes shove, lot people anything kids, seeing lots kids across country getting sick scare straight help realize sooner get kids vaccinated, better.

My daughter turns 5 weeks can't wait get vaccinated. hoping 2-5 year old vaccine far behind child. provided money, also bought supply.  True. people alive 1918 died wouldn’t count it. think things get better worse again, unfortunately differences tiny though, knowledge none studies head-to-head trials vaccines other. things seeing comparisons numbers found different trials single vaccines.

That's say Moderna marginally better, Pfizer available, still go that. best vaccine one get arm fastest, goes kids well. License registration please. son vaxed daughter not. may covid (she tested morning. Results aren’t back). first time exposed husband back April. Zero symptoms. time I’m pretty sure breakthrough case daughter odds it’s delta. even though I’m vaccinated variant worse. non vaxed ppl keep running around spreading breakthrough cases odds get worse variants still doesn’t quite work way. ppl suck. want go back normal. Would better proof vaccine. Extremely strange considering Brazil one highest levels uptake world.   “How’s Caesar salad dear?” “Kind tastes like covid” ton unfortunate messaging back got amplified people really know talking about. ""All vaccines same"", ""100% effective hospitalization death"", etc.

That said, would treat numbers bit caution. Real-world data sometimes pretty hard randomize properly places seeing big drop Pfizer. pretty clear Moderna least little effective slower wane (likely due higher initial antibody response), I'm sure difference significant numbers would imply.  year ***after*** census. owner literally already hire security guard time interview discussed it. would seem Florida, Texas, exist people cretins. count someone lived Indiana vaccinated Illinois first dose moved Kentucky getting second dose?

Not saying dont get dont want young healthy people need Tell random people internet need help gods sake Wow, original study behind really damns vaccines' effectiveness faint praise, closely read. Maybe somebody check work here, here's drew cited study.

First, let's clarify terminology. declared standard threshold, enunciated WHO, vaccine called ""effective,"" meant achieved prevention 50% ""outcome interest,"" usually ""disease."" would symptomatic infections, standard initial vaccine trials. 

This study looked Delta cases ""from 17 May 2021 1 August 2021 Alpha replaced Delta"" found ""There evidence reduced effectiveness Delta-dominant period BNT162b2 newPCR-positives, 57% (50-63%) post first dose 80% (77-83%) post second dose (heterogeneityp=0.60, p=0.23, respectively) (Table 1, Figure 1).""

So, 80% fresh Pfizer delta.

Also: 

""In 18 64 years, BNT162b2 new PCR-positives reduced 22% (95% CI 6% 41%) every 30 days second vaccination (p=0.007; Figure 2)."" ball-parking numbers, three months fully-vaccinated status (14 days post dose 2), protection dropped 80% 65% (about). follow longer that, numbers inconsistent Israeli study findings: widely reported July, cited study Britain, two doses Pfizer provided 41% prevention self-reported symptomatic delta infections.

Note British study efficacy diminution analysis 65. Why?

Based this, find utterly misleading say Pfizer vaccine ""still effective Delta variant"" without qualifying diminishing value effectiveness reaches ""technically ineffective"" first six months vaccination (and that's 65 group). You’re correct, speaking hyperbole, lol Lmao real, government *already* track us find everything us wanted to. need giant vaccine conspiracy it.

You’re right part, don’t data know risks vary across ages. people even put kids masks protect school Yeah mine goes week day gonna go kid test positive. 2.5 year old room... Really dodged bullet. Thankfully school took seriously increased precautions, closed classroom two weeks, etc are, however, many credible religious arguments slavery polygamy. FDA approve whether 5-11 year olds get vaccine not? Shouldn’t CDC ACIP recommendation? Hi! daughter part Moderna trial 5-11 age group, experience good far. She’s shots, two blood draws (which maybe hardest part). encouraged participate trial allowed final say. decided “I’m healthy maybe help kids can’t test vaccine would get sick from
Covid.” 
At last appointment told “hopefully end year” Moderna would submit documents approval. I’m hopeful happens soon worry little bit less.    Anyway moot point post removed everything see - side effects getting COVID (from fever, sore throat, cough, stomach trouble, rash, breathing problems - mild problems serious problems deaths) vastly outweigh side effects vaccine. Non-high risk kids hospitalized well - often, risk statistics healthy kid end hospital long-COVID well.

And - without kids vaccinated, get COVID check. Look hospital situation many states here. Full. need full population vaccinated. Adults even more, without vaccinating kids, get out.

I see also standpoint decision. Yes, difficult decide inject vaccine kid - decision something happens, may think fault. - vaccinating kids, decide kid get sick, kid gets COIVD - also fault. So, rather protect kid vaccinate it, decide make kid sick. ""lesser evils"". Although think vaccines evil, protecting us. mandated get sorts vaccines play sports growing up. get deal good thing school vaccine mandates thoroughly settled there's question imposed.

Also, sexually active age 23, recall doctors ever urging get it. Maybe I'm old? individual point view, risk hospitalisation due myocarditis might higher hospitalisation COVID. collective point view, kids wear masks time, parents grandparents risk death them, entire classes sent home one gets covid, constant testing hassles, think mental health benefits getting done pandemic much higher risk vaccine side effects could bring  soon I'm able sign daughter up, I'm it. getting whether likes (she hates shots) getting ASAP.

You look data. fact obviously going take MONTHS, entire year, get everyone lifeboats.

Not really. Even every single person gotten vaccine, would supply June/July. admittedly unlike lifeboat analogy, bunch people getting vaccine still makes people waiting safer. Yes, time usual flu RSV cases (which greatly decreased last year) back mix. kids back school month it’s pretty common 50% less kids class given day. that’s fun. Schools considering win saying “See, it’s covid.” stupid move negate other. good thing school vaccine mandates thoroughly settled there's question imposed. They're already required get bunch. possible? Maybe massive initial viral dose otherwise how?  read article?

Lawrence noted factors influence person’s access trusted health provider, child care reliable transportation, critical vaccine rollout pandemic — poverty played heavy role whether someone likely die virus.

Among Black youths, Lawrence also emphasized role misinformation social media played level trauma experienced community violence might make vaccination priority. reliable source that? site famous making anti-china stories,

I would recommend flagging HKFP source. highly biased news source report anti-Chinese narratives. understand people love hate China, vaccine-related news politicized.

His parents can't wait approved, live much safer pandemic. would add, CDC-ACIP also handles stuff relating vaccine administration recommendations look something wrong, treat it, etc.

Basically, FDA gives companies ability make ship vaccine. CDC-ACIP handles details around getting shots arms safe responsible way. vaccines severe side effects pop couple months shot. dining public want protect immunocompromised son? Take Spanish flu!  Agreed, possible. entire medical system would basically collapse long point. Fair question...for me, avoiding mass death via something easily transmissible. already many vaccines required K-12 schools military, could seemingly one them. Anyone link official communication international travel US? news sites they're reporting different things need know applies absolutely countries. trying evaluate risk, can't look severity alone. risk assessments LOT part job three parameters use evaluate risk (Severity, Likelihood, Detectability). latter really make sense scenario Severity Likelihood critical making informed decision. 

To give example: 

I presume drive car every day. risk get killed/paralyzed/etc. T-bone collision every time go intersection. Yet still drive multiple intersections every time get car. evaluating risk, Severity risk extremely high likelihood low. result, risk considered acceptable. 

When comes vaccine, media heavily played severe side effects likelihood severe side effects extremely low (myocarditis . severe side effects far common fun. kinda like pushing gym. sucks like hell moment worth done. 

All assumed zero cost null decision. reality, getting vaccinated increases risk contracting infection. Infection virus causes many issues dramatically increased likelihood. example, teenage males 6.7 times likely contract myocarditis virus (450 cases per million) vaccine (66.7 cases per million). potentially severe side effects, differential even worse! 

* Clotting issues occur rate around NINE TIMES higher rate contracting virus post-vaccination
* Strokes occur almost ELEVEN TIMES higher rate contracting virus post-vaccination
* Deaths, differential much absurd. THREE deaths linked vaccine, meanwhile half million deaths virus.

Mine's turning 9 month poking updates minimum vaccine age week since got ours. I'm irritated constant stream ""can go yet""s. made mistake commenting local news station due large influx anti-vax comments. 

My favorite takeaways:

*""my daughter laws mom nurse NC vaccinated....now vent fighting life... Mask vaccines work ...so nobody knows ....the icu Dr said 8 10 right (just one in) vent vaccinated""*

&amp;#x200B;

*""My doctor said good stuff going come months. saying trust science doctors?""*

&amp;#x200B;

These people literally understand doctors get knowledge information SCIENCE.

This normally engage Facebook said lets make today \*spicy\* ill reason. know myself. Yes!! hope get soon Keep mind back March-April still pre-Delta variant. Delta variant may well give impetus speed things round reviews. I'm really hesitant 2 4 year old maybe even 9 year old get covid vaccine.

Imagine, one hand, vial vaccine protects child worst COVID. hand vial COVID, orders magnitude dangerous child potential harm vaccine. 

In essence, telling kids want play ball pit heard someone left needle there, instead make play pit broken glass. I’m honestly surprised triple population since then! 😮 translates exactly many 5G bars?"
