There’s lot edge cases boosters really important would mRNA prevent that? It’s used create spike proteins, degrade.

There’s nothing permanently keep generating spike proteins body continually produce antibodies against.  Same. Got work every year. gotta actually read study. information vitamin supplementation use collected median 10 years COVID tests, saying continued take it. circulating vitamin levels also differ significantly btw control study cohort. mention discussion, needs brought whenever vitamin referred miracle drug (which happens every couple years), supplementation associated health-maintaining behaviors low levels vitamin correlated poor health lack activity, causative it. 

We gave COVID ICU even pandemic saw many patients die, benefit exists acute setting, pretty unclear. Yeah, totally makes sense agreed part reducing hospital burden. honest right. vaccines first rolled efficacy transmission expected stay 90-95%. hasn’t happened. It’s looking like vaccines help personal protection neat future.
However people getting vaccinated put end hospital burden. problem fixes I’m HoH able read lips rough  even legal framework ""forced allow treatment"" hospitals? What?  gotta least read first paragraph. horses almost one. horse-people  someone love needs hospital care, desperately, can't get overwhelmed unvaccinated? Well sucks you. Enjoy freedom die hallway hospital.   NSW population density close nothing (10/square km), mention Australia relatively isolated too. 

That *never* going work large parts Europe.  dumb question, answer clear. 

It political otherwise. People fully vaccinated, limited supply, encourage boosters one both? Additionally, bad optics considering many regions world wracked thing. 

What dumb headline lol. Well he's vaccinated. we'll see goes keep quoting Dr Eric Topol recent NPR interview this, sums clearly, ""if want avoid symptomatic infection long COVID 18 39, would get booster. 40 above, want avoid hospitalizations deaths addition symptomatic infection, get booster.""

Dr. Topol awesome issue. Twitter feed COVID related issues must read me. always links newest studies vaccines news new treatments works. good info there.

Here debate Dr. Sarah Long (one anti-booster scientists serves CDC ACIP group). Fast forward 1 hour 6 minutes in. Dr. Topol (arguing favor boosters) waiting waiting Dr. Long spiel tears whole ""all important protection hospitalization death"" case add hospitals robots taking care patients, going stop.

But Africa, are. health systems geared handling them. knew “not everyone needs booster” thing nonsense science kept talking it’s important get unvaccinated vaccinated.

Yes. Even 100 unvaccinated country, fault surge.  Obviously completely efficacy infection starts rise. giving boosters point cause new wave like Europe suddenly percentage people get infected rises. oblivious might risk speading it.

On hand delaying booster likely leads better immunity. easy decision. accurate. I’ve seen efficacy infection 6+ months out.  acting unvaccinated. mandatory vaccination place now.

They lockdown seems cases rising beyond contained.

From articles sounds like unvaccinated protesting.  can’t get access doctor  leader country live literally said, “we’re final stage terrible journey” summer. yes, feel like fucking lied to. Totally agree! Death could blessing - know much systemic damage virus susceptible bodies. avoid sample population, family done everything minimize exposure viral load we're unknowingly exposed (i.e. fully vaccinated, masked remaining friendly, socially distant). Long-term COVID symptoms certain hot-topic medical research years come. 1+2= reality

1+2= common sense  original vaccine numbers, year ago, showed they’d hit park.

The success criteria vaccine roughly original variant vaccines Delta; make less severe less transmissible. sense, “good enough.” boosters weren’t available nothing, we’d still successful vaccine.

If want take Ivermectin goes drugs. Maybe forgotten Rio southern hemisphere. late spring there.  Dont let truth understanding data manipulation stop idea figure numbers, spoil mass hysteria!  Covid endemic yet far. Endemic means reasonable infection death rate. called pandemic endemic phase. vaccines make endemic.

Here's couple things think about.

Many serious viruses like polio, mumps, measles eradicated basically eradicated.

Influenza variants really serious virus became pandemic become endemic United States (at least dice longtime). Sure serious viruses like West Nile present near numbers infection influenza. 

The interesting thing influenza gained population immunity survived. genetics passed us. really interesting found parts human genome used call junk, however junk DNA ancient viruses. still learning plays in. 

 look Spanish flu (influenza) vaccine. survive didn't, unless lucky, thus genes passed on. important? Well vaccine protecting us covid. However, protecting many people genetically susceptible covid. still puts much higher risk one knows people are. particularly true new studies finding genetic involvement severe covid. Unlike case Spanish flu pandemic working natural selection covid vaccine.

The r value Spanish flu 1.8 covid strains (like Delta) seen r value 6.5-8. means way way contagious, 4x. 

Many really serious viruses mentioned end endemic. Influenza vaccine Spanish flu natural selection acting, population genetically predisposed survive thanks ancestors genetics. That's comparison flu COVID drastically genetically I'm many areas weeding done. 

The goal virus kill host (unless spreads dead suppose). virus kills host passed on, people going die even new virus introduced. case particularly, coronavirus likely coevolved bats way better immune functioning humans due extremely fast metabolism factors keep check. many people exposed lineage B type coronaviruses (Sars, covid, ECT) genetic weaknesses present population. generally natural selection occurs.

Cool thing viruses mutate. eventually get around vaccines die out. found strains covid spike protein much less readily identifiable antibodies vaccination. However, infectious strains stopping spread right like Delta. true covid call proof reading machinery causes less mutations occur maybe good. Although, r high 8 fair? already seen mutations two years. Plus, finding infects wild resivors like deer. Spreading different species often introduce mutations well. way modern world works spread around world much easier many historic pandemic viruses. leads higher spread may never possible previous pandemics. modern world primed crazy viral spread like unfortunately. Bill gates telling people years needed prepare inevitable one listened. 

These things lead one major difference previous pandemics. first time able vaccinate large portion populate natural selection taken place realistically, giant science experiment. vaccine immunity wanes mutates arise may see endemic phase right away. Would awesome did? Hell yeah, nothing life simple. 

So many variables want happened previous pandemic viruses became endemic play.

And think it, know immunocompromised people? say fuck people exposed. Immunocompromised people immune around often. vaccine may help old people may enough end. different antivirals know mechanism disease action though.

So point using mechanisms prevention? try wait till COVID goes away, that's stupid. going away. giving science time catch flattening curve.

Again, endemic wish people would stop spreading this. cause going away make endemic yet. though. 

If reacted better beginning world could much better. However, would world.

I'm sure I'll get voted want different reality. fail mention underlying health conditions had, flu kills people world stop !  uncle immunocompromised (cancer patient remission) one earliest vaccinated.

His immunity probably still sucks.

Just remember could killing him, too, addition causing potential lifelong side effects kids young vaccinated (I likely lifelong otological issue caused COVID vaccines available).

Yeah, antivaxxers would die, would fine that. take others them, great health and/or old innocent ones.  You’re putting straw man argument flu shot. two unrelated diseases.

Your response reads like justification getting flu shot yearly anything covid. tells you’ve never actually gotten real flu! thing is, „no boosters required“ predicted protection rate, statements delta variant emerged. people tend forget fast. matter (or lack) knowledge.
As pandemic changes, goalposts changes (they to).   already COVID. would surprised grant exemption based that, especially show measurable immunity (T cells, antibodies, etc).  restaurant bar rule definitely enforced visited Skiathos summer. travelled large group people, vaccinated not, none us even heard rule, never asked.

I wonder enforced islands.. Like said, new rule. Vaccine mandates existed long time. Also specific Austria, 2015 international bio-ethicswcommittee ruled mandatory vaccinations appropriate. pull others them. Vaccinated, vulnerable family members colleagues, people, got stroke, heart attack accident need urgent intensive care, icus full covidiots. Cancer patient treatments scheduled full icus etc. problem unvaccinated people fill hospitals hence also affecting vaccinated population. Austria already bad time serious accident hospitals full. I, healthy 38yo male, got COVID 6 months first vaccine shot. Yeah that's also vaccinations 12 really approved EU yet, there's ethical risks potentially introducing risks children primarily protect protect age groups. Why? Generation great song.. Vaccines don’t kill COVID. It’s like clouds sterilizing mist hovering like aura around vaccinated people. 
 
Vaccines give vaccinated person’s immune system recipe identify make immune cells fight COVID infection already takes root host. Whether asymptomatic, feeling horrible, vaccinated people’s total “COVID journey”, 3-8 day affair. indeterminate period virus present body unaware of, getting acquainted disease, followed period time person experiences COVID’s effects fights off. Sometime whole experience goes unnoticed. That’s asymptomatic “carrier” *is*. 
 
Unvaccinated people generally longer duration experiences COVID, symptomatic, hospitalized, die. Since symptomatic longer-duration infections, get lion’s share blame transmission. 
 
I don’t see black white difference. 
 
Anyway, since virus multiply transmitted regardless host type, differing degrees, answer question obvious... disease like type chain reaction. spreads easily multiplies fast, ever dies permanently (in pragmatic sense) insufficient number people leapfrog to, lack active form immune cells actually “COVID killing” duty bodies. 
 
Our immune systems archive “recipe” making active immune cells duration episode understand defender complete. reinfection occurs, takes time system demobilize recipe, body doesn’t immediately know responding flu, COVID, paper cut introduced bacteria body.

Americans always want feel special, whether it’s positive negative way Pretty sure there's genetic factor immune system well like everything else. born inherit strong immune system gonna better odds diseases. Covid kills healthy people hidden immune system defects. people Africa subject natural selection probably better average immune system health weaker / defective ones removed population offspring. something civilized world away from. even choose breed defects. ""oh diabetes want kids, F noone, stop breeding giving child"". still magnitudes protection 0. still much enough people get infected thereby spread virus get infected spread less shorter period time. Plus boosters recommended counter exact effect. What's point? 6 months since 2nd shot 2 days... Ive wondering thing. 

I know two people got Covid vaccine - one 5 months vaccinated one 2 months vaccinated. would rather get covid again. every state authorizing boosters everyone - CDC YESTERDAY authorized everyone recommended everyone booster (everyone meaning adult). That’s right. According news report shots fired It’s article’s headline Pretty sure there's genetic factor. born inherit strong immune system gonna better odds diseases. Covid kills healthy people hidden immune system defects. people Africa subject natural selection probably better average immune system health. Sick surprise slightest. Source: living Bavaria. many stupid people like: ""Never problems kind flu. gonna get shot! *hurrdurr*"".

Even sister law like that. got it. tone changed sick 2 weeks. think bad wording. ""Possibly"" would work better ""presumably"" case. Stopping spread COVID Australian Open's mandate, though. That's government's job, different countries adopting range measures, including vaccine mandates. AO wants keep COVID out. Players' medical decisions purview. better ways achieve specific goal. mention, latflow + antibody checks probably superior since lot vaccinated people spread COVID die COVID well. No. decide themselves. decided get vaccinated happy did. 
That said, vaccinated people carry virus still infected. argumentation, ""stayed fuck home"" also. 

There less intrusive efficient measures taken obligatory vaccination kill eachother vaccinated not. 

I'm sure Novak assure tested anytime wants thus pose danger society people foot bill case needs hospital care. 

Stop dividing people basis vaccination, getting vaccinated perfect measure protect society. 

While agree vaccination best state viewpoint lowers chances serious symptoms death, thus enabling hospitals implode, choice individual gets vaccinated not. Especially case people take care treatment follow measures wearing masks, getting tested regularly such. don’t know “life destroying”, can’t understand damn thing people saying. 

Also, job talk front groups people, I’m breath minutes taking mask. 

My youngest needs speech therapy right now, it’s impossible mask clear masks aren’t good. 

Masks aren’t worst part Covid let’s pretend downsides. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Even areas least restrictions still illegal for: March June 2020; November 2020; January May 2021 - nine months total.

I'm aware country world (I'm saying none, would interesting know any) restrictions inhumane place long that.

The fact Guardian (and others self-identify progressive political spectrum) think UK somehow soft restrictions says *a lot* sources reality situation. Indeed, many countries praise role-models (e.g. Norway) never (again, feel free correct I'm wrong) banned private gathering two people time. covid vaccine reduces transmission too. point weird Fauci can't think vaccine one important factors keeping people hospital flu vaccine serves purpose, especially older vulnerable individuals. unvaccinated send anyone ER. unvaccinated also mean requirement medical resources treat ""selfish"". 

So pls stop labelling unvaccinated people dangerous, threatening, selfish... Stop dividing people. Yes. many cases school kids go to, daughter's good friend got month. came back, telling long term effects. Hopefully not. guess actually knowing someone pretty closely that's (my daughter) age get sick really affected her.

My kids ecstatic get vaccine get travel see people holiday season too. Define ""stop covid"" please. 

Killing humans would stop covid

Ending trade activities would stop covid.

Forcing everyone wear hazmat suits would stop covid.

Not much short ""stop covid"". infectious disease ever eradicated smallpox. Eradicating COVID remains highly unlikely. covid 15 months ago. Body odor smells like sautéed onions now. ""protesters""

They wanted say nice hello police officers. discount benefits exercise, study showed correlation causation, yet title implied causation. need accommodate though, isolating themselves. choice vaccine. hold leverage, vaccinated population wondering are. want play AO abide rules watch TV. guy also right freely decide everyone's bodies around him? din't think too, needs stay fuck home away people.  Yeah, live southern Ohio despite young healthy, fully vaccinated mid April. There's many people see Typhoid Mary inspiration rather warning  lower restrictions, cases start rise again, mental health takes nose dive again.

Let crazy cycle. Problem vaccination rates Europe quite low. Australia state government aiming 80% vaccination aiming 90%. lot European countries even 70% vaccination rates. Surprised me. thought Australia would anti-vaxxers. example better understand mean:

Let's say R0 Delta 1.3 R0 alpha 1.1. Since moment around 2 percent people infected Delta, average every 50th transmission Alpha would come contact Delta all. R0 reduction Alpha direct competition therefore also lowered 2 percent (98 percent transmission get contact delta). R0 1.078 instead 1.1 (and less people currently infected smaller effect becomes)

So unless R0 variant slightly 1.0 small effect can't outcompete whole strain circulating large population already.  There's different strands anti vax movement

Wakefield British brought ideology US France Germany anti vax movements pre date Wakefield pretty sure Novak vaxxed TLDR; don’t know lots speculation per usual.  mere protests though, full-blown riots. Although know enough details judge whether using gunfire justified won't. Speaking someone took vaccine... better ways accommodating vaccine skeptics. antibody tests negative lateral flow tests, better anyway since vaccinated people still asymptomatic carriers. Straight banning unvaccinated people AO counterproductive vaccine skeptics see blackmail, going strengthen viewpoint. eastern Europe vaccinated much west, wave spread west might never started. scientist quoted article one, he's keen many restrictions possible: circular argument:

* need restrictions cases high.

* way high numbers cases restrictions. could refuse, people shit that. feel angry. 

That said risk mention completely abstract less intrusive measures taken first minimise ""danger"" allegedly poses unvaccinated man.  symptom detected standard nasal swabs. appears COVID pretty much intestines. acceptable weekly cases deaths?

If going say zero affable, attainable acceptable? way ""back square one"".

If Delta first Covid version, would really fucked everything up. time arrived UK, USA, Europe, etc. (shame true India), annoyance caused fraction problems original Alpha variants. True. study shows might symptom. Due that, may intuitive consider COVID cause. Yup shopping cart send anyone ER require medical ressources treat selfish.  basic level, R0, level transmissibility - one variant better able transmit, infections variant generated time, become dominant source new infections. Remember, we’re dealing exponentials, effect compounds rapidly time

Can see visually happened time, multiple variants, it’s Delta everywhere  It’s universally available yet advice doesn’t cover everyone’s reality parents, aunt uncle, two cousins lived polio. say restrictions like ones imposed covid here. (And still imposed throughout world)Their schools close year cover half face public shops movies closed. remember community pool closed bit. great aunt also permanently paralyzed polio. course, infected individuals quarantined.  Restrictions could varied depending location. We're New England. alreday vaccine mandates many vaccines never questioned it, question mandate comes covid vaccines weird case British Exceptionalism, Guardian usually argues against, comes Covid (and climate change) believes UK UK alone power change world.

The truth virus mutate anyway, somewhere. Long-term restrictions stop mutations, deal mutation anyway, obviously irrational position take. (Unless literally everyone else to, they're not; would work, won't.)

The Guardian last hold-out Zero Covid, editorial line even turned New Zealand recently. One aspect habit cherry-picking scientists quote. Famously declaring releasing England's Covid restrictions ""threat world"" ""dangerous experiment"" - universally shared opinion, government's scientists agree (they're political appointments, they're appointed independently, Chief Scientific Adviser appointed long current Prime Minister became Prime Minister) ultra-cautious approach even sounding caution often do. Indeed specifically advocated higher spread summer avoid winter surge like we're seeing Germany, Austria, etc. Germany make additional deals manufacturers, though mostly BioNTech. deals highly critizized german pharmacists associations well parliamentary opposition, purchasing european partners accomplish labelling someone selfish?

Covid already house twice, means they're taking proper precautions. combination worrying long-term side effects vaccine (yes, know less dramatic potential long-term side effects virus, explain someone let know works out), religion, lack education.
I wish people would get get vaccinated. miss families miss getting see want get sick.   Yeah! able tell doctor prescribe Vicodin Oxy!

Gtfo Oh really? total lockdown military streets delivering basic groceries stuff people home? efficient sure, infinitely intrusive. thats tho point I'd like present lot. 

I'd ask stop insulting me. fully vaccinated. still belive vaccination choice obligation despise people divide people basis (un)vaccination. Fucking shit. imagine, he's antivax taking seriously all. excuses endless.  went chemo earlier year vaccine time oncologist’s approval encouragement. guess different doctors different opinions it. Boy sick, though! Flu like symptoms vaccine going chemo side effects fun combo. virus here, now. health care system would collapse everyone collectively lost weight. like telling people invest infrastructure cholera outbreak. Yes, obviously, *first* maybe let’s work preventing people dying.  Delta: meet Winter      must disappointment. agree feel sorry them. They're definitely hurting realize it. biggest problem behavior though they're pulling vulnerable collateral damage. can't sit back say ""oh poor souls."" remember vulnerable members society killed reckless. I'm country ICUs half full people wanning immunity they're allowed get boosters.

Yay Switzerland. strongly resistant vaccine, real 
risk counter effect, could unwelcome consequences 
you come round introducing new vaccine programmes Covid, flu illnesses.

Really? people irrationally resistant current set COVID vaccines somehow clear-headed open idea vaccines, going pushed edge resistance society's insistence show modicum concern fellow man?

I sincerely hope Simon Williams guy misquoted. No, you’re vaccinated masked. hopefully boosted too. There’s reason covid (for personally) seen different flu season. different set beliefs led vaccination status. stick beliefs too--listening medical team's advice.  Perhaps time free (at point delivery) NHS subcontracted care unvaccinated (excluding can't vaccinated) covid patients private sector? private sector bill either health insurance policy anti-vaxxer directly.

If law needs passed get passed.  ICUs clogged covid patients prevented working?   doesn’t need slippery slope. one suggested be. incredibly simple: get vaxxed enormously reduce chance hospitalization. Europe part US awful, feel guys. Anti-vaxxers protesting feels like voices loudest sometimes, rest society.

I'm sure happen UK, high Covid cases seem tolerated government anti kind restrictions like basic mask wearing. work health care (allied health). hospital hit hard delta. case numbers dropped, overflow ICU beds closed, finally felt starting room breathe again...if could catch non-Covid patients...then, wouldn’t know it, new unvaxxed patient requiring admission ICU intubation - well guess non-Covid patients wait. keeps happening beyond tired. Every single time feel like stop take breath, there’s new admission, new urgent consult someone Covid taken turn worse.

And every time think, wouldn’t working right you’d gotten vaccinated. could enjoying weekend, instead, try help survive wouldn’t get simple vaccine. new one France? B.1.640. many flu cases deaths acceptable?

How many colds?

How RSV?

The answer is, course, zero. never end disease.

I’ll honest, don’t know answer many acceptable. Clearly accept level risk lives. Driving car, example. myriad times dinner party unmasked pandemic ended cold flu. 

The answer virus become endemic. people continue die. get better treating it, less people die. 

We can’t put genie back bottle. wish could. world never same.   People eating natural portion sizes unnatural foods. American portion sizes seem small eat vegetables, whole grains, beans, greens, etc.  reports breakthrough infection occurring individual received booster? Can’t seem find anything possibility great. myocarditis concerns people like seem silly since COVID causes much higher rate.

It certainly tracked like has, data see cause concern. accomplish comments?  It’s sugar portion sizes way hand. even working medical field patience wearing thin, cann even imagine frustrating must healthcare workers.   patients unvaccinated people it’s also growing thin. coworker daughter tested positive doesn’t care goes mall. seem think get make stronger antibodies. don’t get it. it’s equally likely cause death. Death without preceding symptoms worse Something R0 2-4 doesn’t vanish without actions bring R-modified 1.   I'm gonna blame government Aunt Becky want put Twinkie.   I’m sure point.

Because society can’t function without essential services— healthcare, groceries, logistics, utilities— even strictest accepted restrictions won’t completely eliminate transmission. people always try break rules— it’s human nature interact. 

If we’re looking Dutch situation, closing stores restaurants 8pm basically nothing relates COVID, grave financial mental effect industry. It’s government control finest. look new case rates midwest northeast states worldometers website, every single one showing significant uptick last weeks.  Every one.  
Meanwhile, holidays coming, people travelling, football stadiums filled. friend United Kingdom USA   Even surgeries. Last year two three surgeries completely told rushed out, way early without properly trained recovery  is. Big food companies lobbied make ""healthy food"" system giant lie. Companies using food based propaganda lie people food healthy them, ""parameters"" built labeling requirements allow omit, intentionally convolute information without breaking laws. also multiple large fast food chains decades set standard meals. BIGGER, GREASER, FLAVOR. Sugar literally everything. Looking back even 20-30 years ago fast food meals smaller, cup sizes smaller, food ""fresher"". people grew fatter companies slowly increased size food. Suddenly burgers bigger, two patties instead one, sauce, extra cheese. standard large drink 32oz used 22oz. X-large drinks available 44oz. Unlimited refills. Multiple fast food restaurants next literally everywhere. Thanks big companies, food education horribly lacking. Kids taught healthy school, parent know either. thanks lobbying, government make laws restrict companies, improve national health. literally society set fat, obedient, misinformed. Fck got mine. way live conclusion seems reasonable (take precautions substantial transmission), wish qualified more.  vaccine I’ve ever issues first shot Shingles, 2-6 months I’ll getting second shot, I’ll suck realize day discomfort WAY better alternative. goes every principle healthcare systems.

Everyone afford pays in, everypne needs gets treatment. may put right words qualify PC, they're wrong numbers.

This research highlights burden heart metabolic diseases U.S. Almost 3 4 U.S. adults overweight obese. Nearly half people prediabetes fit narrative. idea case nurse wife tells true area (rehab).  forced go office work, even though 100% capable working home. put risk train, work mask requirement people vaccinated, one enforcing mask requirement. analogy, employer forcing smoke cigarettes. ..save want can't. One patient undergo several cycles chemo wait oncologist give OK took almost half year could get first shot. *sigh* 
And systemic diseases prevent that. truck ivermectin front, I'll even chip costs Maybe EU work weekend Initial estimates least 9-10 months. Hopefully Israelis right interesting scary. really go way bring circumstances.

Although important people know still vulnerable Delta even fully vaxxed, also important public health authorities report relevant facts. lost enormous amount credibility COVID open American people going on. future COVID people listen CDC on. loss credibility among anti-vaxxers COVID deniers --- general public people take COVID seriously. Thin? Mine gone months.

\-signed immunocompromised person. lmao fucking military anything it. want know, service country abiding rules paying taxes. 

Monopolising sentence ""serving country"" military f*ucking dumb. Military even exist ideal world. far 80 % protection pill that's yet - yay! understand sentiment, ... \*really\* want nurse check vaccination status unconscious? half-dying? 

The emergency room emergencies, want doctors treat ASAP. leads issues, I'd rather stays way.

Plus, get slippery slope ... fat people? smokers? vaccines? want perfectly healthy people go hospital? :) 25 year old male here. Got Pfizer booster two days ago. gonna lie, beat ass like 2nd dose lol. It’s interesting symptoms followed exact trajectory 2nd dose. getting shot afternoon, first symptoms besides sore arm arrive evening, short bout severe chills accompanied shakes. transitions fever, nausea, headaches 24 hours. that, usually feel fairly better 2 days shot (today.) Right I’m tired sore lymph node, appetite finally appears coming back bit. know made sound terrible (and definitely wasn’t fun), I’m glad got it! So, babies? I’d agree adults also people like babies etc etc group. Triple vaccinated robotic engineer. I've first job 3 doses family stand science within family. free much needed housing.  Yeah, title really say “despite US”  son, thought raised better. [Just resharing article February 2020 again. Especially regarding COVID becoming 
Lipsitch far alone belief virus continue spread widely. emerging consensus among epidemiologists likely outcome outbreak **a new seasonal disease—a fifth “endemic” coronavirus.** four, people known develop long-lasting immunity. **If one follows suit, disease continues severe now, “cold flu season” could become “cold flu COVID-19 season.”**

This seeing now. would good public health officials front this, instead implying directly saying behavioral actions could ***eradicate*** COVID-19. Cases going go down, high levels randomness happens different places different times. real sustainable way avoid high levels death hospitalization vaccines. rest noise. agree lot people work lose weight (myself included) causes many health issues, getting vaccinated 1000000x easier shedding weight. Sure need cut pound two significantly overweight, that's big deal. talking 10+ lbs, that's usually lifestyle change, diet.

Losing weight keeping eating less maybe exercise. usually economic psychological changes need made too. mean people work towards maintaining healthy weight, means easy. getting vaccine (especially covid) easy gets. Occupied G&amp;A beds COVID: 5289
Occupied G&amp;A beds non-COVID: 80065
Unoccupied G&amp;A beds: 4936

Percentage COVID patients occupied G&amp;A beds: 6.2%
Percentage COVID patients G&amp;A beds: 5.9%

Occupied ICU beds COVID: 897
Occupied ICU beds non-COVID: 2574
Unoccupied ICU beds: 855

Percentage COVID patients occupied ICU beds: 25.8%
Percentage COVID patients ICU beds: 20.7% Yes, keeps happening. 

I remember right big summer surge, state sub crowing: ""We're Baaaaack!"" everyone screaming get back normal getting angry anyone suggesting tiny bit caution. Boom. bad surge. seem remember that. Numbers go down, everyone says over. go again. HCA?  Well ask people vaccinated that. saying symptoms look, serious odds serious symptoms/death plays role decision making people get get vaccinated. Brazil like 210 million people. 8K cases day pretty low.  first dose last year relief! Could finally treat COVID+ patients without thinking they'd kill me. Cool! ... explain provide proof vaccination I'm unconscious?  guess different doctors different opinions it.

That may part it, differences patients also play role. Oncology extremely individualized. Unfortunately even many forced get 1 2 shot keep employment likely get booster. end day politics winning war.   done prevent health system overwhelmed. always goalpost. prevent changed. far, I've heard happening within couple days booster... words, got infected getting booster.

It's probably common occurrence healthy people, could definitely happen someone immunocompromised. Going chemo, example, really mess antibody levels.  documentary outlines fairly well, even kids star-belly sneetches bellies stars. plain-belly sneetches non upon thars hear man. tumor growing pancreas needed surgery take out.  wait, too.  Fortunately, bumped front wait line done 9/27....but year knowing something growing inside can't anything pure TORTURE.       Medical ethics know ethical. They're avoiding making decisions. refusing choose also choice. many people suffering care enough even get two shots taking hospital beds?  nightclubs bars open? conventions held? I'm definitely worried Comiket. slippery slope. unhealthy engaging dangerous sports endangering rest society one thing. ERs designed capacity accommodate regular stuff. something much irresponsible selfish, affects us all, ERs designed it.   mean example Germany vaccinated versus unvaccinated right fifty fifty hospitals. Old people boosters given late. Nevertheless fragile narrative. why? law forces process?  remembered past health scares like SARS etc seemed go away quickly without affecting USA much. assumed covid would same. “Part issue, claims, FDA office would need work ten employees, including two trainees, currently processing 400 FOIA requests. also says process time-consuming page must reviewed line-by-line information exempt FOIA would need redacted.

The FDA said standard would release 500 pages per month rolling basis — 6,000 pages per year. Divide 329,000 6,000 result 54.83 years.

At pace, request fully answered 2076.

Courts waiver standard 500 page per month processing rate even FOIA request would take years process, FDA said.”  Cancer nurse - every time cancer surgery delayed rage. I’m unbelievably mad antivaxxers taking care immunocompromised patients. Lost another one week covid vaccinated chemo knocked ability mount immune response. shouldn’t know unvaccinated nurses caring struggle contain outrage. Sorry, digress, wave wave unvaccinated covid patients taking priority cancer surgery deem ELECTIVE caused brain short circuit. cry admit. Insurance hospitals deciding elective really highlights broken system is. 
I’m sorry hip surgery. wish could shake health care admins across country’s heads asses.   what, argument since there's risk anything all, whatever want regardless risk others? fact anyone road could die aneurysm excuse drive drunk.

Your argument ignores concept risk profiles relative danger expose others well. Germany fifty fifty unvaccinated versus vaccinated hospitals. Considering vaccination rate still win vaccine though. seems wear rather fast without booster older people hospital. I’m curious country planning deal fake vaccine records. got downvotes Austria thread, nobody explanations. friend’s cleaning lady came back bus Croatia, said selling fake vaccine records €20 border crossing. border crossing checked anyone’s vaccine status. government make laws require digital pass phone? They’re United States people without smartphones, batteries run out, etc., still bring paper vaccine document get restaurants etc. purchased internet $200 so. don’t personally know anyone fake vaccine card know someone knows someone etc. planning prevent Europe? going allow every bartender access national vaccine registry verify?  Homeowners insurance required law rebuild old house was. allowed build move somewhere else. laws created protect neighborhoods rapid property value decline.  Basically. depictions zombie outbreaks movies bold enough. much easier people handle idea mindless gross looking creature spreading infection. difficult pill take one thinking (mostly) normal looking individuals spreading infection... inspect why: lack empathy, cults conspiracy, self absorbed cultures. would want watch second version silver screen anyway...  went Puerto Rico spring break… rented house. fantastic measures… everyone wore mask - everyone - temp checks hand washing stations entered public places. Top notch!   countries really infrastructure detect excess deaths etc. simple example Africa. can't tell covid death stats even remotely accurate. South Africa example registered 89,000 covid deaths according worldometers Africa yet neighbours like Kenya similar population 5,300 covid deaths Nigeria 2,900 covid deaths much bigger population. countries fairly young population think pretty clear stats see Africa doubt missing large number covid deaths. Hell even South Africa excess deaths South Africa since March 2020 271,000 like 3x higher. course excess deaths would covid still shows South Africa likely missing quite number deaths. 

A articles even showed pretty evident they're missing deaths due lack infrastructure etc. 

[link Getting rid never happen. always places world spreading. Got week ago Delta around long vaccine Half PICU unit unvaccinated rona too... Northeast boost winter, South summer, imo, given indoor habits. I’m Canada went from:
1. Let’s stay home let hospitals get ready
2. Two weeks flatten curve
3. Wait elderly vulnerable vaccinated
4. Wait everyone access vaccine want it
5. Wait 70% eligible vaccinated
6. Wait 90% eligible vaccinated
7. Wait vaccine approved kids
8. Restrictions 10 people hospital (in whole province) still continue spread it, it’s affecting already broken healthcare system. great article Atlantic people leaving healthcare droves due burnout. plenty people haven’t break since March/April 2020. Even surges, places bombarded people put going surge things got pushed back. can’t imagine working hospital right now.   situations hospitals overwhelmed covidiots, means let's allow unvaccinated get covid treated.

But fair deny vaccinated, cannot vaccinated, life-saving treatment Covid, injuries, heart attacks, strokes etc bunch people decided get vaccinated overwhelming hospitals? freedom choose take vaccine comes great responsibility allow decision negatively affect people. remember smokers claimed God given right smoke wherever hell wanted totally give shit harm others. finally pass laws stop behavior. antivaxxers exactly like that. Therefore, go back line get covid need hospitalized. similar allowing unvaccinated come workplace well within rights prevent behavior harming others. 1 week protect yourself, 2 weeks protect others test negative  are. vaccinated doesn’t guarantee won’t get sick, mean won’t get really sick. significantly decrease chances first, significantly decrease chances second. It’s important get boosted make sure protections stay reduce rate infections. Less infections, less spread. Less spread, less need boosters future (hopefully) true. mother got light case that's great, hospitals telling completely different story. Source: wife works one local hospitals, never gets day sees people getting destroyed Covid daily. think is. know 1/3 population contribute nothing preventing American deaths. 1/3 America eligible third doses willing get needs listen here.

Get third dose. remember ""2 weeks flatten curve"". Look turned out!  know patience might wear thin. still take care people need help. barbarians. Doesn’t matter it’s enemy, take care people sick, need help. 

Do forget that. evil. barbarians. Tell need help, too. don’t nobody start telling need reject sick, acted stupid. think it’s anti vax people focus comorbidity way say covid isn’t bad. reporting high number covid deaths reporting death covid directly covid. lot people died covid would’ve died something anyways. already one foot grave. Etc etc

Not saying person bet that’s it’s getting downvoted. asking hiltlmptv experience.  I'm sure - hoping genuine answer. curious know many people work healthcare. Unfortunately, both. caregivers directly involved patients many truly want help sick, regardless personal choices (exceptions every rule course). administration side things pushing high cost COVID treatments actually relying unvaccinated cash cows also altruism staff continue give caring them, even beyond burnout. 

It's bad couple years watching situation evolve lime terrible slow motion free way pile up. Well written echoes basic thoughts many.  don’t blame them. I’d tired treating people think pandemic hoax possibly called obligatory names threats others time. Public care pandemic ended. CDC issued travel last year 5 million ignored it. year even bother saying travel know would ignored regardless said. reality Covid stay far CDC unofficially acknowledge Covid endemic, officially long time happens. friends PR island dealt tragedy Hurricane Maria earthquakes they're stranger death destruction instilled need protect other. loved ones refuse get vaccinated, also loved one denied care hospitals full. see sides, obviously don’t. Nonsense, almost good coin flip.

Citations needed. e.g. made 40% patients recover quickly harm 60%, would exciting result. think unlikely. likely show benefits, fairly marginal. 

As said, reasonably clear journal articles linked, really much good quality evidence either way. Lots noise, lot signal.

Hopefully point get proper answer good quality trial. then, we'll tinfoil hat brigade claiming sort conspiracy, health regulators trying explain people DIY medicine generally bad idea... Yep, hear you. Ohio well right now, least rural parts. company work employs around 600 people 17 leave work last week due Covid. course kind enough stay working, unmasked, actually tested positive. would shocked employee population anywhere close 50% vaccinated. infuriating. literally hours starting mandate enforcement last week. hours meeting OSHA put mandate hold. ""Meeting canceled everyone, get asses back work"". I'm sure, I'm definately anti vax I'm getting lot assumptions am. Right limited total number beds hospital, full, patients go elsewhere. I’m saying cut certain percentage hospital . Well answer genuine question...    Yes, lot this. We’re sad place country facts logic window Facebook place get “the truth.” First need make vaccination obliged, like Austria did. takes several months implement, legally practically. start this, starting maybe 20% bill. Wait, think obese people smokers aren’t filling hospitals? came post deer. live state routinely see maybe 20+ deer side roads. saw unmasked hunting parties last night Walmart . next Covid variant likely going come deer. Covid year incubate evolve inside deer. There's telling much changed. Unfortunately almost certain another surge. seeing public listening anything says aka resisting getting vaccine wearing mask till point. Eve state like California, areas one wears mask. german tagesschau reported october 29th. Though vague leat part estimates still happen. vaccine 100% effective including booster shots.

And government certainly risk averse, anything try pretend nothing happening right now, measures taken weeks ago... remember earlier year said MASKS (if you’re vaccinated), remember happened that? Hundreds thousands people died.

He likes cover ass terms conditions also good news dispenser, it’s gotten lot people killed, it’s going continue so. Nowhere well encouraging people fly eat room elderly people, that’s completely idiotic.  live, really depends are. stark neighborhood neighborhood. one live in, people wear masks. drive 5 miles over, everyone wears masks. Even toddlers cute teeny tiny masks. surprised I'm bit younger second hip too. heard second harder I'm getting anterior method.

the arm thing though, wayyyy worse last time “You’re killing injecting zinc royal bee jelly! I’m going sue you!

There real world consequences peoples inactivity get simple shot billions already got. others feeling consequences instead selfish?

Right applies one two states, several others decide new measures next week. (Depending state may affect unvaccinated everyone regardless vaccination).  dangerous use bathroom stadium mall public place accommodation.

I doubt this.  every eligible adult done part gotten vaccine soon available them, could couple months. They've claiming doesnt matter people vax still catch wish lived hypothetical situation unfortunately don’t  Yes, do. **Yearly deaths US**

Chronic lower respiratory diseases: 156,979

Diabetes: 87,647 Sorry mom, hope speedy recovery! could make less contagious, though, reducing viral load reducing time they're infectious. That's really vaccine doing. Maybe enough own, another weapon war. Recently, continuous long list pending transfers higher level facility. recently received young unvaccinated severely ill Covid leapfrogged entire transfer list severity. passed included MIs needing evaluation, new brain tumor, gi bleeds. vaccinated, person probably never would needed hospital someone else needing urgent care would got care earlier. frustrating. two shots, week two weeks assume two weeks safe   No, hospital would also set number covid beds. Stay    US, deer crazy infected covid. 

I wonder animals spreading in. Many influenza viruses spread poultry hog farms jump humans. 

We know infecting zoo animals. 

There outbreaks mink farms Europe North America. British Columbia banning mink farms it. maybe new technology. think we're going start seeing various new things fight virus.   many people brain tumors lose sense smell/taste due olfactory nerve damage, report extremely high levels depression. don’t know mean people whose taste smell CHANGES opposed people completely lose latter something there’s aid for. There’s way give senses back. Losing two five sense suddenly pretty life altering. would also argue extremely individualistic topic likely cultural differences well factor in. example, Italian culture focused food drink gathering family share food way sharing love. suddenly able truly participate anymore would jarring. don’t know, losing anything definitely life altering me.  problem *my* hospital—in area high vaxxed good Covid precautions—is overrun unvaccinated Covid patients. get seriously ill injured, won’t room me. Everyone getting punished shitty behavior people. hindsight — applies many countries — obvious mistake vaccines thought holy grail, lead *all measures* dropped! instead kept restrictions practices vaccines, combined vaccines, world could reasonably good situation now. However, current situation worry winter might actually *worse* previous one, choices made.   still believe people rights choose whatever right body. right expect society pays choices. form colonies whatever, long affect rest us. understand moment made decision, forfeit right part society. 260,000 people dead per year US alone COVID?

Right. covid nearly bad people give fuck. bad fat walmart Americans, average joe good.  picturing people reading things like history books 100 years now, disgusted must it. I’m bitter angry sad scared you. Mostly first two. It’s time stop giving self-inflicted illness priority.  willfully unvaxed *really* need bottom triage priority. Yep. Anyone acting eradicate ""beat"" COVID cases nearly non-existent blowing hot air living fantasy. case count obsession dismantled panic laden headlines every bump wave need stop. real psychological damage done populace large folks exaggerate risk fully vaccinated folks try shrug reality pandemic raging unvaccinated population equivalent gas fire. think necessary completely eliminate fake vaccine documents, provided rare enough problem. tiny minority it, significant effect herd immunity healthcare. Almost laws circumvented all. rely fines punishments deter this, level also trust majority citizens right thing time. risk caught pay hefty fine even go jail probably enough deter most. I'm 8 months pregnant got booster shoot. feel better knowing baby increased odds COVID. Hopefully long infants toddlers get shots. would poor tax  really. people don’t vote mean swimming lessons necessary? non packed waiting area even better gives better ability fight particular strain. sure, survive COVID19 variant. little help vs delta variant.

It's get flu shots every year. think everyone frustrated too? That’s billions dollars spent public health campaigns smoking, obesity, drunk driving. 

I don’t think anyone expects completely non judgemental doctor. expect treat regardless opinions. think doctors absolutely instill shame people. Yeah they’re not. several lovely ones Europe. saying would hate live outside US (or UK guess) egregious lockdowns / cancellations. thing happened me. 12 year old cavalier stomach issues mass growing impossible get anything done help covid. eventually passed away mass got big causing breathing issues. forever hate people everything don’t think that’ll ever change. blame people happened him, right wrong don’t care. passed 3 months ago still eats every single day couldn’t get fixed treatable. hope dog able get something done late. comment automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  First thing think someone mentions Vitro studies. Deaths I've never seen Christmas market US anyway. kind culture really exist US, least raised. what's optimal booster two moderna shots? Another moderna Pfizer mixed doses? walk-in appointment county people sure get. gave fighting chance. hope rewarded it. hospital system work releasing daily Covid Stats. least 6 months, *every bed full we're diverting patients* *20 patients across 3 hospitals* unvaccinated % dropped 80 last week first time.  incredible much anxiety falsehood around [the COVID-19 vaccine] [vaccine mandates] could possibly necessary year witnessed. strong hold information people outweighs rational thought?

I agree fully. mindboggled grip disinformation people. Personally I’d want go nasty fine something denying care though. Asking HCPs kill people could saved also isn’t without emotional cost booster protect me? got last friday     Thought I'd interject: really need pay attention he's saying. 

Guage risk.
 3x vaccinated?

 state well, state travelling well too? 

Are members family vaccinated? 2x? 3x?

If conditions met: yes. Take mask smile. Eat turkey.

*If not:* remove mask. Things risky. Might want cut visit short. Whoever ruined real jerk. Go home. Eat turkey there, people trust.     You’re right. evidence overwhelmingly clear people bad assessing risk. especially MUCH higher risk severe illness contracts COVID would ever vaccine. It’s really sad. Everyone family vaccinated, small kids...honestly know.   secret die anyway. hospital staff look chart know person make they’ll overwhelmingly die still give beds. brother-in-law showed died ER exactly way. I’m grateful didn’t steal bed weeks someone deserved more. Triage shouldn’t take account immediate severity also likely survival point. One friends booster. group us exposed covid work function. (Abour 8 us training) one person symptoms tested day before. results yet tell anyone. Anyways...my friend ended testing positive days later. EDS autoimmune disease. vaccine provokes immune response. cause over-reaction body’s defenses, go overdrive. Piled top existing immune disorder, isn’t surprise. 

It’s calculated risk. You’re better would covid. Turns out, vaccines work unless people get vaccinated. Yes, front desk person gym able verify QR code national app. code linked registry, verified. 

I’m Netherlands, standard common EU countries + countries outside EU.    anyone likes reading booster experiences, mine...

I got Moderna booster Wednesday around 12:00 afternoon. 10 pm night, started experiencing following: chills, headache mild body aches. Thursday, lot fatigue chilly. 100% Friday 11:00 AM. never sore arm fever.

My time booster side effects way easier second shot shorter mild. second shot gave intense symptoms 10 days straight. like felt booster, still able function grateful worse. Agreed. isn’t food additive requesting data on. We’ve dealing covid almost two years can’t get can’t get enough people board vaccine. One would think could stop FOIAs limited time could get data move past shit. think right spread viruses covering mouth constitution. No, I'm sure anti vaxxers would still want NHS. Tories don't. Tories vaccinated. really care general population long lining cronies pockets. Get significant percentage population paying healthcare beginning - like perfect gift govt.  MS checking in. whenever people mention medical excuse able get vaccinated drives wall. disease modifying therapy I'm on, 4 week window spring could get vaccinated. time state category (1b+) yet drive seven hours get vaccine. totally worth it. I'm immuno compromised basically locked last two years.

these antivax shit bags refused service hospitals. I'm done murderous habits, care life care theirs? patient day wearing “facts feelings” t-shirt found bilateral pulmonary embolisms. unvaxed. crash cart outside room o2 low hard time breathing. told doc he’d rather intubated vaccinated. breaks heart  estimated U.S., 20% healthcare workers left field since start pandemic due death, early retirement, burnout. Ditto, I’m England friends thought hilarious stocking up. one day, went supermarket emptied thing left whelks. luckily supplies (and careful - buying extra bag pasta one week, another rice next. wasn’t selfish) us, got phone call brother-in-law taken ER Covid, went unconscious minutes died. It’s awful left behind. It’s also awful daughter 19 got call first drive 3 hours get him. he’d died home, refusing science like pandemic, wouldn’t stolen bed someone else needed hours. I’m devastated death still furious almost 2 months later refusing vaccine still taking hospital bed someone else entitlement.  Feb-march 2020, got told talking covid office (my friend buying thermometers, making sure food stocked, slowly week week) - within week email going round telling stop discussing it, Wfh. I’m still working home little pinch heart keep feeling got vaxxed . Ask self . Also remember movie got vaccine CDC guy disobeyed orders. went procedure, they'd closer us.  Makes consider assembling “COVID Patriot Pack” HCQ, Ivermectin, multivitamins, liquor, coupons home food delivery. Basically, everything need stay fuck home die swaddled stupidity. take home test, isolate two days either way, see doctor case. feel like healthcare system overall got wriggle room resources figure best function it'd help lot. mean, accurate tests done quick enough know someone return work weekend.   Thank you, much appreciated.    It’s weird it’s become meme. I'm fan US healthcare corporations case fault, hands tied completely. Federal law established medical ethics preclude hospitals turning people away based poor health choices, acceptable way prioritize care current need. Sadly means person low oxygen levels COVID gets bed kid cancer, COVID person die hours without oxygen vs cancer kid probably months. fucked honestly.  China allow proper investigation events surrounding outbreak. 

It's pretty surprising western governments, scientists, journalists others curious holding accountable allow investigation.    guessing patient disclose work sick. disclosed providers cancer center told get covid test. patient happens nurse working rural hospital (different cancer center receive medical treatment). line ~~Forsythia~~ Ivermectin starts back there. LFT tests already free pharmacies UK. Problem high false negative rate non-negligble false positive rate also. would need PCR good evidence Covid infection would imagine. Patient brain tumor delayed. pushing day discharge joint patient (usually need overnight) try talk doctor again.   Turns 'FDA approval' many 'holding for' real concern theirs.   That's like someone sleeping someone know aids, start get symptoms aids, knowingly sleep someone else process mention symptoms checked. reasonable expectation could carrier onus properly notify risk. bypassed consent. first two Pfizer booster Moderna. yesterday morning well. arm hurt less woke body aches still lingering. Nope. It’ll simmer eventually merely become endemic. 

Get vaccine. Get third jab. You’ll almost definitely fine. Life go on.   think showing people brutal cost state subsidised healthcare would make want NHS even less? Yep, hospitals run razor thin margins, unless owned large insurap It’s Missouri extent that’s messed up. backstory new DHSS director one follows science. one hand, we’re getting massive backlogged data things like deaths non-lab-confirmed Covid tests prior director suppressed. massive dump shared Thursday evening places recorded Friday it’s backdated. 

On hand, counties also shut holidays massive delays they’ll report week shows poorly data (Jackson reports frequently delay). Especially state climb now. Jackson also dropped masking that’s likely going give bump own. 

Missouri likely good data week next holiday data dumps won’t reliable data trend info first full week December, point it’s likely bad. positivity rate rose 5% last 10 days across state that’s holiday spread. It’s making hard know happening unfortunately don’t single cause explanation likely won’t real answer 2 weeks old data everything awful. could accomplished simply letting unvaccinated hospitals. Many unvaccinated tools Zero problem lying get ahead kid runny nose. 

By time anyone blood draw runs titers check antibodies fucker already burrowed system. 6 months since got saw recommendations shift adults get it. also got Friday didn’t affect work. respect belief, ask freedom respect mine.  Sweeping generalisation.  Getting vaccinated super easy do. Probably likely, jobs person, ability take time off, public transportation... can’t make city mask mandate; wear mine. else would do?  healthcare provider taking care COVID patients authorized get booster FDA approved late September. vaccinated 8 1/2 months previously.

2 days boosters became available me, got COVID sick.

It made angry, known months boosters would required, FDA dragged heels. recall, controversy US people get boosters many people around world yet vaccination? December 2020–July 2021, COVID-19 vaccine recipients lower rates non–COVID-19 mortality unvaccinated persons adjusting age, sex, race ethnicity, study risk days.  are, best, lethally incompetent. little bit either, like “bigger wars” lethal, “keep going anyway” incompetent. think people actually going pay six figure bills? Especially they're dead estate worthless?

Elective surgeries way profitable unpredictable sick people.    Yeah that's awful would knowingly threaten health, well being, future earned income decision negligent. knew ill, admitted respiratory issues. turns COVID get infected, that's really tragic. Yes, in-laws chosen host unvaccinated family members, recognizing high risk ones won’t joining holidays then. Normally I’d disappointed unvaccinated son died fall really emphasizes enabling are. They’ll accommodate granddaughter’s loser boyfriend living son. least they’re vaccinated boosted, even empathy son nurse daughter. claiming ventilator actually killing people so...  fine. ran one people thinks stop everything covid.  spreading take kid swimming lessons, spreads people die getting vaxxed going bars without masks etc.  Don’t forget us went got vaccinated right away waning protection. people won’t get booster don’t know should.

It make wife feel pretty crappy day time get people may want deal even it’s dangerous game play.    Yeah, he’s saying smells smoke, building completely engulfed flame. That’s compliment, I’m trying praise level headed anything like that. friend nurse, exhausted last year. months ago sobbing, said one patients ventilator begging vaccine said gotten around yet.  I’m sorry you’re going hope things work you. don’t deserve sound like stand dude, hopefully positive karma comes way. addict emergency get triaged everyone else. people understanding ER operates triage?    also late pill then. there's that.  never *insinuated* did. hyperbole make point, *does* happen places Africa. interested life like children African coutries civil war, suggest reading *A Long Way Gone* Ishmael Beah. requires also get tested shortly onset symptoms. know, rather blowing cold fair, patients walking physician offices number years WebMD printouts, trying dictate medical care. mentality stepped political theater.

There absolutely physician-patient relationship medical decisions made jointly, way means patient politician gets dictate physician job. Yeah, “mild” overly broad definition.

My mom “mild” case (I would call moderate). Couldn’t even turn times mitigate pain fatigued. serious prescription pain meds diseases still complained much hurt.

Scared shambled out, saying, “I’m weak. need food. I’m getting weaker.” appetite ever forced eat. smell either. Pulse/ox dipped “concerning” levels times would slowly climb back up, hospital. Says worst illness ever had. Took two months really recover still stamina issues.

My sister fared better still miserable. knows long term effects be? 

People look weird wearing actually good mask 3 shots already. work public high community transmission. Like, even without severe case, don’t want nasty life. today, Satan. today! simply require removed office. COVID contimmunity. quite see level pockets herd immunuty. need get used uncertainty. Thanks responding!  suggesting ""Vaccine equity"" anything recommendations coming FDA CDC advisory panels? something pushed WHO, FDA CDC.

When boosters initially approved, still open question whether risk/benefit ratio would prove remain favorable healthy individual 50. imagine screwed booster caused ten times cases myocarditis compared second dose already-vaccinated population already virtually zero risk dying COVID? would left public confidence vaccines shambles would much worse off. harassing health workers easily found youtube, glad jail   believe read somewhere like first five days symptoms onset. doctors,” ruling states. “We empowered decide whether particular medication administered, whether particular doctor granted ICU privileges. role interpret apply law written.""

Hopefully made loud clear judge trial court over-ruled. Maybe send doctor tell judge job message clear enough. No. think will. too! They're obese wear goatees reading apparently depends virologist ask. said seem Delta booster would game changer. 

It's also good preventing heartworms dogs cats.

How anybody ever thought worm medicine could fight virus eludes me, guess stupidity never rests. Flu RSV much bigger risks them.  many want pandemic go forever dabble public health too, firmly believe SOCO approach, Single overarching communication outcome, partially blame.

Each communication failures perfectly crafted messaging context SOCO. focused changing behavior rather informing public risk. nuance action driven messaging science behind novel Coronavirus changed, would huge betrayal trust. Don’t worry, always elect one. frightening place in: despite personal responsibility, could die something else care.

yep wish antivaxxers would realize they're playing dangerous game getting vaccinated, they're far gone. Low risk isn’t zero risk. Don’t get wrong - live lives. They’re daycare / preschool. sadly live area lot folks don’t take seriously. they’re vaccinated, thus isn’t me. must confess, first time heard Tilapia skins burn victims, SURE story Onion. Okay, memory correct, messaging changed! think flu shot ever option young person young adult. I've spent time Africa, small well large communities. places visited, one consistent thing large amount time spent outdoors. COVID progressed last almost 2 years, wondered might affect outcome African countries, given viruses like sunlight much, seem spread well outdoors indoors.  general public able get vaccine unless approved FDA. point messaging - FDA approves trump Fauci says dont get it, get it? Low testing might hide infections can't hide serious illness death scale needed account discrepancy. Deaths COVID SSA 100 times lower Europe Americas, despite vaccination rates single digits many countries. ICU's hospitals never strained large parts world. Morgues overflow, bodies streets funeral homes reported dramatic uptick business. 
 
Unfortunately long time scientific community large ignored mystery. pity studying might lead better understanding illness new ways treat it. rioters mainly nutheads. guy asked question feelings important preventing spread COVID.

I'm sorry, genuinely believe that, weighing one other, individual's feelings trivial compared greater need stop global pandemic. 

If feel makes asshole ""what's wrong world"" fair enough believe selfish take minimum precautions getting vaxxed wearing mask prevent spread COVID actually what's wrong currently. 

Compared life immune compromised daughter, feelings meaningless me.  It’s least three dose vaccine work properly try save ski season hope will. Making mandatory path follow countries. got downvoted yesterday complaining sick vaccination made suggesting might get fourth booster it. can't take three days work every 6 months. I'm sorry made sick long. got booster Thursday I'm starting feel human again, feel temperature spike every time try get something. seek professional help extreme reliance people. None rest us car symptoms week dunno everyone got tested.  Fascinating. Australia they’re available everhone six months second dose. wonder wasn’t case everywhere. Hoping avoid winter surge Early 20s too. would actual panic attack someone put me. Wearing clothes taking medicine unnatural.

By logic, fact we're shitting tree right abhorrent life ending. Got mine (Pfizer, since weren’t green lighting mix match yet) one month ago. whiny beforehand really force myself; didn’t want side effects (I problem first two, anxious one reason). 

I stronger reaction fun, mostly hit night kept up, meaning sleep deprived next day. (TBF, didn’t much alleviate side effects; mostly just...waited feel better.)

But next day off, done 24 hours shot (it 8 hours feeling yuck, book-ended hours feeling kinda meh). course, are. I'm illusion front. difference COVID transmissible likely kill millions people Vs. feeling little bit sad people telling wear bit fabric face. 

I'm sick anti-maskers thinking feelings trump lives millions people. fucking piece cloth.

They fairly normal. Look Eastern countries.


No, wearing time normal that's happens pandemic.

Pretty standard.  dreaded ""Chemie,"" even feared drafts. I'm depressed seeing people's faces.

Masks saved life. really needed? literal definition need - course need it. need vaccines. Sure millions die need vaccines. Poor choice words opinion.

That said agree worth waiting for. data Israel show non Delta boosters help lot. hand Delta booster number people getting Covid would reduced significantly since pretty much Covid Delta I'm excided getting another booster another six months. work scientific field (not medical). Absolutely one work interact work thinks like that. We're logical work, zero expectation people behave us.

Don't blame scientist-tropes CDC/FDA fucking up. fuckups entirely unrelated scientists.  mom (and dad also since lives her) anti-vax, tried tell pregnant woman vaccinated likely stillbirth. 

I looked said ‘that sounds like complete bullshit’

Him mom ‘very worried’ cousin due soon, she’s vaccinated. 

Insert eye roll. curiosity, old you? I'm late 30s message drilled teen years flu shots elderly immunocompromised. first time one offered pregnant. feel like last 10-15 years flu shots widely offered everyone.  many people apply live vulnerable areas though. ie, places allowed 18+ get vaccines May last year excess vaccines bc lot antivaxxers. Eg: Mississippi.   think argue first shots important third shots logistics place jab poorer countries. New York City vaccinate anyone comes still dumping expired vaccines takers. imperative vaccine gets Africa Third world countries never see end bullshit. I'm tired. I'm boosted gf boosted parents brother sister aren't. saw sister go bowling drinking Michigan. I'm tell parents love instead Thanksgiving vaccinated family, sister really want tell mom nevermind made different plans. sister can't act like shit still going on. Sorry ranting I'm exhausted worrying toddler. That's factually incorrect. Yes, encountered virus make immune system adept fighting said virus, immune system health also plays important role, regardless whether encountered virus before.    Yes people wear extra protection want to. need mandate everyone. see lot people saying everyone protesting current ""lockdown"" rules Netherlands that's it. government looking new restrictions basically means get QR code test negative. 

I understand restriction all. give someone who's basically guaranteed negative QR code? understand people upset. time know dutch police hit anyone purpose without good reason. sucks happened honestly government fault talking restrictions all. vaxxed Covid death 100 year old patient. low lot data rare new variants low chance could change. try get covid ever seems impossible people done precautions want move probably going get covid point. Whether means actually get long covid unknown point figure people get vs don't. seems combination high numbers people infected high vaccination rates. government failed miserably early on, many people infected died. vaccination rates good. two together seem pretty effective (for now) keeping COVID cases low.  vaccines limiting transmission much like, would actually change situation significantly? understand it, immune response standpoint Delta cell basically unchanged earlier variants. thing makes Delta crazy infectious evolved evade vaccines part, evolved substantially higher viral loads.

Basically Delta-specific booster anything understanding.  casually racist douchebag yacht club one thing. make guy president give license say whatever wants without consequence, brings ideological ""cleanse America white race types"" make Trump's base. Couldn’t get dose city while. tribes region giving anyone wanted one, nearly drove hour half boonies one. Cancelled appointment happened mass vaccination event close openings.  Man..I got Pfizer form initial series Dr suggested go J&amp;J boost heart issue. least I'll get close 91% So, qualify! know combination several things. One people never cared start never changed behavior changed long. Plus people right thing got vaccinated moved on.  low risk, vaccinated skipped everything last year tell people around family gather holidays everyone vaccinated? 

And everyone vaccinated probably smart anyway mitigation measures enjoy family. 

That said could rough months.  biggest bar night year Wednesday night. People holiday parties again. hope scary think could be. 2 years remove fully

Seasonally Court sanctioned malpractice think proper term. Unfortunately, history shown that's governments &amp; rulers work. find grab power, regardless good reason time, hold onto it. people rebel power grabs freedoms maintained. We're two years lockdown, initially intended two weeks, governments looking restricting people houses, least one country even selecting certain people restricted. many places, we're starting show credentials get basic services &amp; goods. vaccine panacea spread virus, appears likely endemic us. one knows quite do. estimation, better disseminate education know ultimately leave individuals &amp; families decide manage lives. pretend think we're going eradicate virus, given that, would much rather live world show credentials leave home go grocery store. And, way, unvaccinated tend poor &amp; minorities. condone violence, think people rebel small &amp; large non-violent ways saving bacon, principles behind BLM, despite mass violence committed name mostly jobless &amp; bored people, nonetheless important. Yeah agree. way Brazil handled pandemic far lend believing report like this.  mostly antibodies waning, makes sense, reason body primed getting sick encountered virus time, though B Cells exist.  five years total knowledgeable people saying. That's when....

Obviously vigilant now, better virus season monitors.  link go highly technical discussion. forum virologists epidemiologists discussing mutation sets sufficient designated lineages. I’ve teaching RNA SARS-CoV-2 enough year follow discussion. Kids catch COVID. Kids spread COVID. vaccinate kids, fewer adults get COVID. Fewer adults end hospital. Yeah agree that, real question ""what makes someone sick enough work?"". read whole article clue actually happened. shoot lead bullets? Baton rounds? Bean-bag rounds? Incendiary shotgun shells? RPGs? Terran Tactical Nukes? actually happened?  follow directions read (10-15 minutes?) since take time line fully develop, unfortunately I’ve experience seeing test lines show right away BinaxNow kits, liquid even gets control line. People choose choose live decisions. Even care, still someones daughter, son, parent, spouse etc. think that, could one relatives dying streets choose get vaccine.  hospitals overwhelmed, matter much them: suffer result   suggesting it’s never moved? percentage vaccinations required herd immunity initially said be? said now?.. told boosters weren’t going required?.. are. believed would need boosters annually anyway, personally issue end result messaging terrible. wonder people don’t trust governments. Yeah, totally wrong question. Japan country 200 new cases per day. prefecture actually 1 new case population 5 million Friday. still completely masked long time government mandate, concern empathy general population. Even reaching really high vaccination numbers low cases, safe go unmasked. politicization masking vaccinations US, maybe sometime 2023 masks? feel like point wanted designate specific number beds unvaccinated covid patients keeping others free accidents/heart attacks whatever, I'd fine that. Come hospital designated beds antivaxxers caught full? bad. autoimmune disease 🤷‍♀️ come hearing different reports? states countries saying 20-50% vaccinated.

If everyone vaccinated 100% ICU would vaccinated. would also lot less people ICU. spells magic wands? make hospitals use those? Texas cases also went without mask mandates. Illinois mask mandates cases rise here. haven’t read anything indicating caffeine would interfere vaccine could confounding factors, unvaccinated less likely take precautions like wearing masks avoiding high-risk situations. agree well-written comment general. utterly object spreading misconception, even good intentions. road hell paved good intentions, mask debacle country comes Fauci's good intentions, sourced, must said, context authoritarian's pathologically histrionic personality, made covering face source intolerable anxiety him. I’m actually trained economics statistics undergrad included lot biology.

The memory SARS-CoV2 makes sense given they’re much related viruses.

I would assume antibodies produced would both— body wants neutralize entrance cells binding keys (spike proteins) killing actual virus (N protein). Well triple vaxxed don’t think masks offer real protection. Also find hot uncomfortable. Don’t care want wear done them. actor Jason Sudeikis also anosmia wish people could understand science moves. gotta shrug move it. 

Immunology complex best, we’re going learning years. seeing good news third shots, suggestions lasting immunity 10+ months third shot (makes sense given know childhood vaccines.) yeah, should’ve less sure ourselves. Alas. It’s hard balance giving people hope cautious. 

The argument we’re taking away poor countries dumb face though. Tedros pound sand. issue supply CHAINS, supply. seen research decline antibody titers rise infection rates months third dose. Third doses opened under-50s mid August though.



By comparison second dose really nice graph. Though also worth noting immunity infection driven antibodies (they decline, immunity not) show [that third dose - or, hopefully, show longer case - antibody titers directly useful.   pathetic visited New Orleans. 

Enforcement haphazard tourist areas places went really check actually saw couple turned away it.

I can't really speak Bourbon Street; bars went bars. bars went to, bouncer/hostess checked vaccine card door, weird, check ID.

It seemed like places Bourbon Street kind bouncer, I'd imagine would same. Zika instead Nicest ""bedside manner"" I've ever heard Doctor, we've got two family, they're near nice Daniel.  part first world countries gave assurances third world countries left behind left dust. good optics another round country desperately needed elsewhere.

Edit: also entirely understandable. link article Well tough, live society collective good outweighs individual liberty. jail “picking quarrels provoking trouble” – 

Yeah, UN everybody else call out. Please continue mask, let rest world uncover faces live normal life Well, consider source information quote, we're comparing doctors researchers Donald Trump personally. worst messaging. Doctors researchers obviously reliable sources public health guidance.  subreddits better squashing COVID-19 misinformation state medical boards. fine lockdown long vacine mandate. 

A lockdown restricts rights beeing forced get vacine. truly cringe worthy many people act like totally reasonable suggest wearing mask completely normal continue years reach unicorn COVID zero state  mention antibodies, said ""Those memory cells, acquired response SARS-CoV-1, also recognized parts SARS-CoV-2"". degree recognized say. seem pretty educated matter, sure degree science. cells connect antigen signal B cells start producing antibodies. I'm assuming N protein. clarify strength response, whether enough prevent reinfection. least Austria gets vacine mandate. Without vacince mandate lockdown would brought criticism vacinated. Well 6 months yknow, get mine december 11th exactly 6 months. right. England government won’t even bring vaccine passports events 
They need hardcore brainwashing make easy get vaccinated. 

Presumably China vaccines obligatory. Though think Hong Kong many want since trust government. Interestingly also many Russians say won’t vaxed. least HK choice vaccine unlike Russia  Spoiler alert: people rest world worry bullshit exotic markets Wuhan. don’t get go movies asshole doesn’t want take vaccine ? I’m supposed care people die street? think mostly told 2 shots would it. promising going on. also guilt taking third doses large part world nothing.

As governments forceful... hard democracy 30% voters idiots. Austria set date mandatory vaccines. France Italy made life progressively difficult unvaccinated people. Italy working way full mandate see. might still get there.

I really worry [Eastern though.  know immunity levels post booster early takers Israel? 4 months no? ever end?

Vacine mandate. 

Keep mind (simplified): 

A 50 % vacinated population defeat virus R0 2. 

A 75 % vacinated population defeat virus R0 4. 

A 87,5 % vacinated population defeat virus R0 8.

A 93,75 % vacinated poplation defeat virus R0 16

So diffrence 87,5 % vacinated population 93,75 % vacinated population extreme even though difference look much .  Yeah sort don’t agree link rights available beds hospital. get severe stress anxiety people wearing masks? need therapy Hang there. ❤️ That's third dose data israel (purely professional athletes retire 28 32. probably coincidence. don’t know retain immunity. Many measurable antibodies. 

Antibodies aren’t necessarily immunity, correlates obviously. Yes, reports countries show 90 times, likely 3-4 times time people need boosters. “measures” specifically keep place Yeah, right? start ""wear mask protect others, yourself, we're together!""

Very easy.  article saying coming future?  stop, make scared already  Title confusing. 

Maybe state “ doses sized kids” 100% vaccinated, still requiring masks everywhere

Whicj colleges those? POTS, see cardiologist evaluation propranolol.

I've months years struggling undiagnosed health problems wow. works. people really think won’t play AO? Get vulnerable booster shots (and everyone, supplies allow). Try get higher percent people vaccinated. Get kids vaccinated. Change culture drive mask wearing indoors public places. soon, drugs reduce hospitalization rates deaths game changer even infection rates drop. Yes, matter feel truthfully. need get it. screw time CDC cannot afford it. gotten confusing. lot people get booster shot, told basically ""you really need booster anyway"".  Japan actually pretty high vaccine hesitancy. People grasped important government's extra stringent approval process, usually highly criticized, probably helped reassure people vaccines safe. Thanksgiving craze definitely year. Last year lot people traveled see family members pretty tame time. year, everyone wants make airports packed ever. 

I'm saying bad thing lead new wave. crazy see much different Thanksgiving 2021 going compared Thanksgiving 2020. lucky seems. Almost 12 hours moderna booster side effects mild injection site soreness. ...Is American medical system horror story? imagine people would seek doctor point unless faced bankruptcy otherwise.  denial care hospitals triage happens ER ICU, also Covid patients come masses like mass car wreck something. gonna do, unplug unvaccinated person place vaccinated person bed? swear people sound insane sometimes. pull Aaron Rodgers I'm immunized approach Antonio Brown fake vaccine card route, go full Joe Rogan get dewormer. far I'm concerned, article says vaccines stop pandemic spreading misinformation. I'm surprised people would object, surprised would go route trying attack police point shots start getting fired. needed turn small-scale civil war protestors start shooting back, imo level escalation limited business hours anywhere close appropriate proportionate level objection. submitted application booster expansion earlier week Pfizer earlier month feel you, dealing coronavirus induced dysautonomia. bothered telling doctor I've heard they're ignorant kinds conditions.  politically viable. People hate masks, want ""free"" without them, want assured get antibody treatments get sick.

This right thing, trying stay popular voters. Yes STOP COVID PEOPLE WOULD FUCKING TAKE THEM. 

I'm sorry media 10000% complicit propagating vaccine misinformation. Exactly. extremely predictable. went ahead got booster soon hit six months past second shot rather wait nearly two months inevitable ""Uh, actually, we're recommending adults get booster."" good idea, checked they're Amazon Smile list. I've Googled, can't find there's way suggest charity.

Thanks donating. US CDC FDA focused much following science (which correctly) convenience consistent messaging. science limits you’re going confuse people utterly don’t it.

Note: science shows boosters aren’t risky choice. might much benefit younger populations. forget:

* Banning private laboratories covid-19 tests, including use test kits already used internationally, many crucial weeks CDC-developed test working.

* Refusing authorize antigen rapid tests unless could proven effectiveness comparable PCR (totally missing point rapid testing). Three big number ""The best time plant tree 20 years ago; second best time right now.""
~A fortune cookie ate able force doctor hospital give medication though. Nope. absolutely needed aggressive booster campaign adults 65 start booster conversation. slightest. messaging suddenly changed, appointments (in area) short supply still seniors covered. It’s maddening poorly done. downvoted reason go home &amp; take whatever random drugs want. 

If you’re going hospital care doctor, they’re responsible care. would allow take something know doesn’t work? drug maker specifically stated ivermectin covid treatment. matter long gets arms end?

That end goal. Triage literally denial care based likely survive, enough care go around. run ICU beds, go people likely survive. opinion, two people equivalent chance survive one vaxxed (by choice), ICU bed go vaxxed person.  It’s also really difficult get booster areas areas Germany. science cases actually also favor boosters (and still isn’t) 30 risk factors. Granted, small group (obesity gets 2/3 them) almost cases Covid boosted control group age group Israel. cases couldn’t even make conclusion due lack data. Basically, vaccines working well group didn’t enough cases extrapolate bigger picture result. 

Now, messaging perspective, think should’ve approved everyone way now. People 50 high risk conditions “should” get booster people 50 low risk “may” get booster. doesn’t seem risk giving young healthy people booster- might see much benefit. supply it, might well let people make choice doctors. think got wrapped science forgot consistent clear messaging, critical. Ask hope bring protests wont clue.

They literally trouble makers morons.

Nothing more, nothing less. buy us time vaccinate many people would shed tears. Two things true: tragic people brainwashed dying thousands, **and** need stop killing others. man playing Galaga! anyone know affects certain people others? friend covid, lost sense smell &amp; taste week I’m going week 3. Parents covid well neither lost sense smell taste. 

Anyways, heard taking ALA (alpha lipoic acid) help! Covid.  We're moving back middle ages society.

Great. think *in principle* right. People made immoral choice (staying unvaccinated) massively burning health-care workers, causing covid spread, killing innocent people heart attack something get hospital bed time. immoral let happen.

In practice, know well would work. people find vaccine card? decided double immorality fake card?

I suspect right approach may increasingly strict vaccine mandates everyday life. way time solve problem *before* someone's critical condition.

Still wouldn’t call ibs per say.    feel definitely rules imposed helped rather hurt pandemic measures mention above. Largely due political economic driving factors. US, would say politics really pushing strategies along though instead science unfortunately aunt weeks ago friends never show proof anything...   Absolutely false I've billion blood tests, imagine they'd checked that...it also seems tied GI issues probably related that. think IBS Fribo symptoms occur together reason. sister ICU nurse large Midwestern US city. Covid hospitalizations since last winter/early spring. 3 past days they’re vaccinated. She’s ever seen unvaccinated transplant patients now. depressing. feels like never end. what?  can’t muster quite level anxiety understand it. know someone long COVID double-vaxxed infected she’s still terrified meeting people groups. (An otherwise healthy woman late 30s, brain fog can’t smell.) Delta nasty. think people shouldn’t denied medicine believe beneficial them. right give best chance survive given best judgement.

I’ve long time medical marijuana. I’m dumb enough think Ivermectin cures Covid able access well. curious thing is, insurance stops covering it, just, none pay able afford it, ramifications outcomes? doubt pretty much anyone outside first wealthy people would able pay costs. Keeping school would even damaging. Fair enough. I’m sure reasons feel way. 
I hope best Cautionary note: level control given ruling class, history tells us willing give back easily. read Instagram post claiming '250,000+' protesters Perth Saturday. *has* bullshit, right?

250,000 like 10% WA's entire population. y'all like 71% fully vaccinated climbing.  Market farm animal get people take it. mutual exclusive risk. think patient ultimately responsible care tho. want ivermectin physician responsibility give good medical advice… choose ignore ok? Wow, thought giving 1 booster. here, wore got vaccinated don't.   mystery. Vitamin deficiency greatest predictor COVID19 hospitalization death. shown numerous studies since May 2020. Sub-Saharan Africa receives significantly insolation. COVID19 scary people healthy *which includes sufficient vitamin D*, ""he underlying health issues"" media always like say someone negative outcome. small pockets unvaccinated people drive transmission

Some regions experience noticeably infectious diseases recent times previously even locally eliminated. e.g. US measles, one.   *Ron DeSantis entered chat* Absolutely. difference two positions selfish calling guy's feelings trivial compared lives people know likely prolong pandemic kill people. 

Whereas position want take basic precautions protect others seeing others wearing bit cloth face makes bit sad, selfish different way. 


Maybe i'm frustrated almost 2 years thing still people believe personal comfort important need get thing control.  People hate uncertainty. makes people feel powerless. I'd say modern day trojan horse - curses bad, bad, cost caster victim greatly. internet good aspects, horrific aspects, people learned use internet addictions sneak misinformation outright lies order intentionally harmful plans target groups people. like wooden statues innately bad, fact back gift Gods honor might retreat safely good side - social media internet inherently evil, companies decided care profits, means care use algorithms keep eyes on, drama keeps eyes on, regardless harm foundation truth lies, certain groups/systems use ends people intent target, easily used Trojan Horse. Australia pretty much that, NSW 95% first shot, R 1 No.  Uh, vaccine? think vaccine that’s booster?  talking triage here, denial care.  exactly issue boosters? CVS like 15 minutes. made driving fucking blindfolded Mario Kart adventure sometimes

that's absolutely shit, gave chuckle. delta variant's spread US shots 5-11 year olds authorized due myo/pericarditis. CDC/FDA risk/reward analysis approving vaccines order minimize harm. Boosters outside exceptions lacked necessary data justify approval. nothing politics dangerous buy weird conspiracy theories undermine US health agencies.

Remember Trump complaining CDC/FDA slow walking approval election? exact thing. often heard smallpox breakthrough cases last 70 years compared many breakthrough cases we've covid one year? Smallpox covid vaccines apples oranges. Enough CDC changed definition behind vaccine. unlikely new variant able outcompete Delta due transmissibility 

Is even mathematical model yet explaining ""outcompeting"" may take place ? Even current highest infection rates countries still 1-3 percent infected, thus competition variants would statistically happen every 30th 100th transmission, far less make huge difference.

Seems therefore realistic variants ""self-destruct"" reach generic bottleneck: Learn lesser developed countries. Vaccinate dont make announcements stop social distancing masks etc. don’t enforce don’t announce removal. way lot peoplewill continue follow protocols see latter half 2020, epidemiologists began observe signs concerning phenomenon known viral recombination, different versions Sars-CoV-2 exchanged mutations combined form totally new Gupta says recombination appear common, remains one feasible source new super variant, particularly parts world sizable proportions population remain unvaccinated viral strains circulate freely. “Now Delta overwhelmingly key virus, become less likely,” says. “But large swaths planet we’re sampling don’t know what’s going on. real possibility.”

Many experts told super variant stuff like sensationalism rather true possibility. say unstoppable monster make vaccines useless, medicines useless destroy everything everyone path. agree new variant may indeed come (most importantly even variantS) article problems telling that. Wasn’t also good deal private spread people sharing accommodations event?

Has supported large events large spread? really think that's going go? We've already seen governments drunk power bending rules... There's going lot worrying repercussions future keep pushing thought abdominal distress known symptom? Probably vaccinated Austria intelligent ones. aren’t going demonstrating something believe surrounded unvaccinated people infect them. Gotcha ✌️ Yes 

Delta’s emergence really changed endgame, greater transmissibility requiring higher level population immunity limit potential size outbreaks accompanying severe outcomes … we’re quite yet, especially places lower vaccine uptake 

By Spring, US (and high immunity areas) mostly past pandemic stage, smaller local outbreaks popping time time, COVID completes transition endemic illness rich country show improvment covid situation = Hope! great! Vaccines Works!

When poor country show improvment covid situation = doubt! must fake! believe this? Betteridge's law headlines adage states: ""Any headline ends question mark answered word no."" Thanks appreciate :). Honestly, even know awards 😂, that's Aokay lol Τhen follow law could informed police knew it. fines issued across country time businesses refuse cooperate. Yeah that’s it, sorry meant boosted, sorry  totally agree you, best correct people appropriate. often get met hostility people like think know they're talking ""no vaccines developed keep hospital! That's it!""

In general, meant net result behavior problematic, terms misconception used remind people continue protect COVID. Clearly not. need invest healthcare system. main issue. can't fixed short term expanded capacity need limit pressure put (the health care workers) prevent system breaking down. 

They preparing code black again. Imagine happen people needing urgent care allowed enter hospital full. disaster lot violence involved people attacking first responders trying force help. lmao hate somebody personal choice   feel like theme entire pandemic. clearly airborne far publicly admitted airborne. clear masks effective far masks publicly recommended… staying safe throughout pandemic frequently meant staying ahead curve public messaging. That's it. We're never getting this. We're going pandemic rest lives.  It’s unlikely new variant able outcompete Delta due transmissibility 

However, worst-case scenario going forward would probably variant Delta lineage show signs vaccine evasion, lowering efficacy say 20-30% increasing severe outcomes, possibly requiring reformulation vaccines another round boosters print “Insta-Prayers” package.  It’s definitely relief kids received first shots. Reducing anxiety improves one’s state mind, it’s difficult concept.    said need restrictions transmission rates low? Pure rubbish. western world authoritative stats Africa. Remind Africa country. Bullshit!! would argue opposite true. controlled spread first year, vaccines today would driven original strain extinction. Sadly, tried get back normal soon possible, delta deal with. We're back square one, restrictions.  hope doesn't, whole city Melbourne hates guy. swap labels whatever anti-vaxxers promoting they'll fly shelves.  Depends long dick around don’t get serious it

If continues percolate pockets unvaccinated morons they’ll soon present us nasty variants, it’s matter time one employees wear cartoon costume another employee wore it, breathing hours end, would quit now. Novax Djocovid. 72 000 people attended Dutch Grand Prix 5 September. majority wear masks social distancing. play stupid games, win stupid prizes. city reached herd immunity

I've seen before, hope true. I'd give months making statement. probably reserve spot living guideline trying prevent future mutations, probably also restrictions common illnesses like common cold flu. virus could harmful mutation time, surely. DEFINITELY careful antibiotics antibiotic resistant TB bubonic plague way fucking scary covid.

I agree England still using masks indoors (Scotland still fine), idea need try prevent new variants *forever* feels like intimidatingly impossible burden. Meanwhile England symptomatic COVID cases actually falling, recent ZOE daily testing studies believed.

It makes wonder social distancing keeping everything closed months end right choice. Yeah, it’s like even fair competition covid Post auto moderator doesn’t get context, don’t care vaccinated. literally don’t care stop pretending care think we're disagreeing. Yes, US would much better existing levels efficacy resulting immunity higher uptake, national focus theory. get mandates here.

However, look Europe - level uptake still hitting high rates threatening healthcare resulting arguably unnecessary deaths. shortsighted handwave boosters US public health thing, especially since persuade antivaxers, willing may well protect better. Especially elderly vulnerable. Might case every state yet though   second generation CureVac vaccine. I've glympes discusses changes they've made improved immune response study monkeys. Abstract

Asymptomatic patients Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) develop hypercoagulable conditions acute vascular events. objective study determine whether SARS-CoV-2 present resected specimens patients acute bowel ischemia, asymptomatic Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) persistently real-time polymerase chain reaction negative pharyngeal swab. 
 
Methods 
Three consecutive patients presented severe abdominal symptoms due extensive ischemia necrosis bowel, co-existent thrombosis abdominal blood vessels. None usual manifestations COVID-19, repeated pharyngeal swabs tested negative. underwent emergency surgery intestinal resection. Immunohistochemical testing SARS-CoV-2 resected tissue performed. 
 
Results 
All tested samples strongly positive SARS-CoV-2. 
 
Conclusions 
This first case report patients severe intestinal symptoms presented marked SARS-CoV-2 positivity resected tissues, without usual clinical manifestations COVID-19. results suggest patients might infected SARS-CoV-2 presenting acute abdominal distress without respiratory constitutional symptoms. I'm pretty positive huge swath people would PCR test came back negative unless hospital.  encourage people vaccinated incentive ? vaccine widely available since months, data shows works almost side effects.

There ultimately limits much virus refine terms transmittability. doubt Delta eventually displaced new big leap transmission seems unlikely. close tools (antivirals), manage infections. I’m saying healthcare system part society (yes, it’s important get it), lockdown protect healthcare system means basically close parts society like education lot economic activity. mean boosted? receive booster less anxious getting covid, maybe? Best image could find lmao. unwarranted.

The vaccines reduce risk catch Long Covid, unfortunately effectiveness reduction good effectiveness severe illness death.

Roughly, seems BT vaccine reduces number infections delta variant 75%. that, even symptomatic infection, seems another reduction 50% developing Long Covid. would total reduction 1 : 8 , 87.5% .

These rates might become lower effectiveness vaccines light infection seems wane somewhat time.The latter good reason use booster shots (the good reason better herd protection).

For Long Covid, little hard data, 10% patients seem symptoms several months infection, symptoms quite similar ME/CFS, indeed permanent. issue end game ending covid. won’t happen anytime soon. It’s virus r 8. endgame living thing sustainable way. Lockdowns restrictions sustainable. may mind place huge toll people income mental health. Also look protests Vaccines antiviral pills arrived. 

I'm tired caring people care     Haha yeah sorry, know. making lame joke/being ass   Thank you! idea Israel 5 months assumed 6 given I've hearing elsewhere.  yet different trajectories UK restrictions months. Whereas Europe still restrictions.

Really worked well seems One important factor climate - winter approaching, weather becomes much colder Europe. people change behaviour gather frequently indoors. 

Another aspect schools tried go back normal. However, far countries Germany, vaccinations children 12, among school children quite high infection rates. 

There seems currently relatively broad consensus acute Covid-19 infections dangerous children (and Long Covid, hard data simply missing). fact, rather high case numbers RSV infections among children, also delayed due hygiene measures.

However, high incidence numbers among children turn spread older age groups.

In Germany Austria, health officials lawmakers try protect unvaccinated people restricting many indoors leisure activities vaccinated recovered people (called ""2G""). epidemiologists say unlikely high impact.  eating peppermint altoids trying get taste smell back. Still working. think direct competition -- waves ending ""the virus burnt population"" like people suggest. think end people see rising case numbers exercise caution, brings case numbers down. example, would prevent Alpha competing. 
I think also COVID effectively got rid flu lot world winter 2020-2021 cannot smell, missing evolutionary method smelling smoke (danger), gas leak (danger), spoiled food appears fine eye (danger), etc… absolutely life threatening risks this. genetic diseases blunt senses like kiddos/adults high risk accidental death due unable detect warnings senses allow for. I'm glad body article seems better trash tier headline, still damaging discourse see headlines like propagate.

I conversation last night friends bears repeating: start talking acceptable amount COVID? look like?

Every sensible expert agrees COVID going ""go away"", see rabid reluctance accept that? global discourse still react convulsive fear continued existence? COVID going persist, going ebbs flows, lot life *every* time see rise we're going slammed panic laden headlines nugget truth buried inside ""the majority cases vast majority deaths unvaccinated""?

We. Are. Not. All. This. Together.

We two completely separate risk realities. US government already purchased 10 million doses, presumably cheap/free rollout unlike Warp Speed.   issued it, variants known uncertainty already knew ~35% population wouldnt take vaccine, herd immunity vaccine never expected happen. Didnt happen even VT, vax rate 80%. thought clicked link :/ unknowledgeable self, sounds like good thing. Spread faster less symptoms vaccines still work same? Maybe ticket out. less deadly version sweeping would effectively provide antibodies impacting people much. saw Delta wiping variants, contagious is, wins vs others. Although study find statistical significance less likely cause symptoms, larger study found equally likely cause hospitalization death. 

[Page  day half second Pfizer dose. Literally second approved boosters Sept specific people made appointment next day (I teach elementary kids, see entire School every week). knew going bad, even worse dose two (my fever climbed 101.3 nauseous eight hours take anything it) two days, still worth it. 

If going take yearly every six months though, I'm gonna need body chill reaction though. people carry virus still infected

So something isn’t 100% effective, shouldn’t it? think large majority us feels way. US yes, authorized moderna booster said could mix believe, may better so. Lately, US averaging 1100 Covid deaths per day. equivalent two one- half 747's crashing ground, every single day. would certainly stopped flying planes many months ago happening. numb loss point. vote want. truth hurts.  Even teachers! asked guidelines travel repeated ones international. Long Covid fucking sucks. got Covid December 2020 smell taste still fucked

People naively throw needed ""real"" lockdown without knowing real lockdown entails.  would already known one worked. Ha! OK, Lexus then. good one. even biologically possible? can’t better transmission severe disease? usually comes trade off. transmissible, less severity vice versa. really, lot poor countries poorer areas countries can’t reliably get tested find doctor chance getting another infected person 5%, delta strain.

I'm sure find middle ground part though. hospital system zero redundance already puts huge strain capacity, besides nurses exhausted willingness becoming nurse, besides potential supply nurses, low. combined leaders assuming society whole act 'responsible' excuse restrict things like access offices checking illegal parties homes, caused huge spikes last year, summer again, also causes prolonged lockdowns, one wants take responsibility there's much room people take responsibility. shops closed 4.5 months, restaurants 6.5 months (or actually 8 months interiors), **consecutively**, this. stupid. don’t blame pissed. forget numerous huns bossbabes convinced MLM cure! Translation: fine they're putting everyone else risk overwhelming health care system can't care responsible people they've brainwashed bright. Problem Sars-nCoV certain part population dies. every carrier would die would root itsel out. 

But risk groups currently protected vaccine. mutation circumvents immune response. ones protecting, ones still overburden healtcare systems 

It baffles me, two years COVID things still need explained. wonder lack foresight lack capacity understand what's happening right now. maybe lack compassion others. Yeah, 99% diets fail keep weight long term clearly something everyone choosing. 🙄🙄🙄 need shut 'respect them' attack us? fuck.

I'm forced pay taxes, let's decide make 'personal choice' well.

Your freedom ends somebody else's freedom begins. unvaccinated majorly overstepping boundary. Vaccination mandatory start  Everyone keeps fogetting deaths small part it. 

Many people getting pretty sick enough die hospitalized. 

Long COVID joke yet see full spectrum severity emerging issues people got sick didn’t die. end hospital? Germany UK vastly different vaccination rates way said similar. COVID flu. I'm completely heartless.

Give tank oxygen send home. Normally I'd agree you, people creating situation innocent people losing lives actions totally obnoxious it. limit people's patience. I’m overweight reality situation 78% people hospitalized COVID unvaccinated. people plenty time get vaccinated since pandemic began selfishly maintained unvaccinated status even grew conspirasionist. point it’s extremely selfish vaccinated millions people die year without vaccine. went 6 months knew nasty bit politics wouldn’t last. made appointment get “first” shot CVS. questions asked “which arm?” sure cases healthy COVID before?  Restrictions already considerably lower last year. can't keep restrictions forever, we?  chronic cough almost two months kinda wheezing bit. I'm young double vaccinated can't imagine I'd stand much chance bad bout covid can't get appointment.    Waiting phone dad mom needs go hospital.   guess felt way exposed serious viruses illnesses average American, I’ve always recovered well. I’ve also around many sick people without catching things. either I’m lucky immune system effective. see line thought seems speculative. InB4 someone tells 2 weeks booster useless Netherlands literally kept hostage unvaccinated people. semi-lockdown severe situation Dutch hospital’s IC units. 60% admitted patients vaccinated, risk group 90% fully vaccinated. point full lockdown longer possible avoid. 

I’m sure I’m pro mandatory vaccination, think it’s sick people still don’t think it’s moral duty get shot. (With exception people genuinely cannot get shot) say; lot US states size European countries, rural, unvaccinated populations. Delta wave similarly vaccinated locales Europe. 

Two years we've this. data there, presented mainstream publications, using beautiful charts child could understand, showing almost perfect inverse correlation vaccination rates mortality. 

Once again, Europe showing us future, Milan showed future New York almost two freaking years ago, many people still listen. Hey, well done. That’s amazing.   still letting unvaccinated hospital? … … go home look alternative cure: there’s crystals, homeopathic remedies, horse dewormer, astrology, strong light, exorcism, strong bleach… plethora fantastic ideas try. spend years rejecting science, show hospital begging science? makes sense. Send home best, let outsmart experts using internet. Ditto. Jackson County Missouri massive reported surge 11/18? reporting issue? can’t imagine one day randomly 8x cases.. it’s hard make heads tails data.  Brasil 8000 new cases day ago 13,000 new cases reported day before.  example outcompeted, would vanished speed Delta exist all. Ivermectin Plus Thanks. Luckily Williamson Co highest vaccination rate state it’s still way lower anyone would like. sucks us that's parents  Yep. much meat, dairy, oil, sugar government thinks worth subsidizing.  really answer question...  many dead vaccinated? many age 60?

See stupid context comparison is? 4 5 people nation overweight would seem deeper underlying problem think combo otherwise asymptomatic plus ischemic bowel (surgical emergency). people without much runny nose present life-threatening catastrophic surgical emergency clotting, turned local invasion covid intestinal tissues associated vasculature.

FDA authorized Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine children ages 5–11 years based determination benefits COVID-19 vaccination outweigh risks population. 

People receiving mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, especially males ages &lt;30 years, made aware possibility myocarditis pericarditis following receipt mRNA COVID-19 prior doses Pfizer booster Moderna also got general flu shot time booster.

That's questionable. Testing extremely poor 2020, since alpha delta seem virulent, lower deaths (another questionable statistic looking world whole) necessarily mean lower cases.

OTOH, delta produces higher viral load, perhaps number virions produced could higher even number infected people isn't?  got booster past Friday work.

Let idiots whatever want, live life. many Ottawa Senators hospitalized? doesn’t say Rio zero cases acceptable weekly deaths flu? alternative reduce Covid capacity healthcare systems normal care ring-fenced continue planned. 

Then triage Covid capacity vaccinated people getting priority. denying people care per-say, deciding overwhelm care needs. 

Don't force people vaccinated want to, continue provide healthcare expense healthcare needs rest society.  US, deer crazy infected covid. going find viable way live it, pretending simply do. Vaccine mandates returning office buildings, shopping / dinning public places, attending public events like concerts, sporting events, etc, using public transportation make sense. may radically alter way live order live covid. Because, currently working. hospital overrun, least live, medical community cusp breaking. can't go is. Europe? Pfizer see single case myocarditis trials. virus check age 18, kids also transmit Covid19.   Outside months year spring years away 3 cases day per 100,000 people sustained period.

If 3rd dose enough significant protection time span longer year maybe. Otherwise simply vacinate quick enough outrun covid. truth is: everybody waits last take action, that's insane. worldwide statistics US statistics? quote percentage Americans overweight. Percentage adults important.  Doesn’t matter much past. People mostly living normal lives anyway. agree. Vaccination compulsory. people long haul symptoms require hospitalization? Totally agree. vaxxed. boosted. wife same. kids vaxxed. IDGAF COVID precautions now.   took single week go unvaccinated general. vaccination rate far thing considered lockdowns.

The culture general behaviour also thing.

COVID patients fill 12% beds Germany right now. That's significant, would vaccinate everyone, would drop least ""0.6% hospital beds"" according numbers, even accounting reduced spread. significant more.

In contrast, preventing 70% vaccinated hospitalizations giving everyone booster would bring 12% number ""11.58%"". useful. partial immunity really significant right vaccination, study linked full vaccinations like 2-4 weeks second dose immunization.

Rioting wankers. saw far exponential growth go. Romania brutal wave. put place dumb restrictions(like shops closed 9PM, masks public space - yes, even open air-, unvaccinated curfew start 9PM, etc) 5-6 days daily new cases start massive declining. Guess what? acting like restrictions worked 18k cases day 2-3 weeks ago 2-3k. insane, I'm tired douchebags. proving point likely, know right?    Demonstrators gathered Milan Rome Saturday evening protest Italy’s coronavirus health pass 18th consecutive weekend rallies. Organizers considered strong showing necessary prove force reckoned with.

But paltry turnout Rome — thousand vaccine skeptics decrying “dictatorship” protest Circus Maximus — inability demonstrators Milan dominate, even reach, squares lacked permit, showed opponents health pass small minority, powerful movement. 

Nevertheless, police officers force protect shops prevent violence. Store owners lamented protests disrupt business, especially Christmas shopping ramping up.

After initial large rally Rome October hijacked violent neofascists burst activity Trieste, northeastern port city, demonstrations diminished. Italy suffered one world’s worst outbreaks early pandemic, now, Italian public embraced vaccination. country experiencing part Europe-wide surge cases, bump caseload relatively small.

Roberto Burioni, leading virologist San Raffaele University Milan, attributed Italy’s success keeping Covid numbers partly aggressive vaccination campaign — 73 percent population fully inoculated — partly early intervention health pass. Requiring certificate, known Green Pass, allowed Italy avoid draconian measures, said, nationwide lockdown imposed Austria starting next week.

Mr. Burioni also said strict measures Green Pass, required entry bars clubs, perhaps motivated Italy’s younger people get vaccinated.

“What surprising rate vaccination people 19 29,” said, putting rate nearly 84 percent. “It high.”

As Italian officials continued urge people get inoculated virus, government Friday reported success delivering third vaccine doses people, 160,000 doses administered 24 hours. roughly 6.7 million Italians age 12 remain unvaccinated, country 60 million people.
When Green Pass introduced last month, toughest measure Europe, requiring entire Italian work force vaccinated, recovered virus frequent negative tests earn paycheck.

The government said plans toughen pass. top ministers many politicians country’s northern regions, share border Austria countries cases soaring, urging swab option taken away, essentially mandating vaccinations.   good all. Agree completely. suggesting responsible vaccinated travelers traveling.

My point restrictions unvaxxed travelers domestically mandated testing domestic flights afaik. thing seems preventing unvaxxed and/or sick flying within US basically honor system.

Reverse sychology. Perfect! Yeah glad wasn’t covid! Dude start reading question properly get high horse. coming across absolute moron. flu vaccine isn’t keeping people hospitals, it’s also reducing transmission. Especially vaccinating people come contact vulnerable people - flu shot requirement nursing home staff isn’t keeping nursing home staff hospitalized.

It’s based older vaccine technology doesn’t high enough efficacy prevent cases, prevents some. since influenza doesn’t spread aggressively COVID-19, preventing cases (and transmission cases would caused) means flu shot make important contribution towards containment. mean animal transmissions? Great story. Good wife made home safely. country feel contrasts? Neither two developed covid treatment pills remotely similar Ivermectin would livid. Don’t punish everyone anti-vaxxers.

We actually know state is, news creeps little. 

Then deal societal stigma sick, deep routed, highly unfortunate.

The metric generally reliably work even South Africa could sharp increases Excess deaths, baseline.

For every person makes test least 100 don't.

Yeah. again, purely personal protection (and lessen hospital burden) right? little protecting health neighbours/community (and that’s masks for)? missing something? No, general lockdown entire country. everyone.    problem is? They're antivaxxers. contribute anything meaningful society. vaccinated = play game death. 

get vaccinated = laugh HCA recipients  Got moderna booster 2 days ago. Frist 2 shots Moderna. Yesterday side effects strong headache sleepy. Slept day yesterday. Today (2 days boost) feel OK. Side effects yesterday strong, felt stronger 2nd dose.

exactly 8 months 2nd dose, feel moderna set 12 months. hospitalizations &amp; deaths still way down. read link posted? 

Without vaccines Ireland would full lockdown. Instead hospitals stable. always liked physical education mind adult version either. stupid high school ... stops.   found, problem United States. 

Many cared extensively beginning pandemic efforts commendable. However, people got vaccinated focus seemed shift need help community I'm vaccinated freedoms, deserve xyz. 

Now, many change routine habits beginning pandemic ""freedoms"". Many people mad called greedy. However, many people chastised announcing since vaccinated deserve xyz. changed? Many vaccinated perogative changed. Why? safe matter them?

Continuing measures unvaccinated people... flattens curve health care workers overwhelmed. protected vaccinated immunocompromised. protects older population still vulnerable even vaccination. protects vaccinated go get long covid regardless. keeps hospital space open covid related problems like heart attack. reduces breakthrough infections. reduces formation new variants till know virus. gives time figure solutions science. 

Western countries acting entitled freedoms like deserve everything. Look Asian cultures like Taiwan. follow measurements greater good everyone. Sure, sucks know couple years lives gives away many families enjoy rest lives together.

My friends mother passed away covid. fully vaccinated. daughter said ridiculous live like vaccinated went back normal life. Well, infected mother mother died. Yes, 63. However, destroyed family. 

This gives rise bigger question. bigger systemic problem west, particularly United States? always feel entitled freedoms common wealth? politics become divided cannot think together either side? tragedy commons like metaphor United States way thinking nowadays. 

My grandmother quite old. lived bad round polio lived United States. asked handled complaining unfair missing college. said, community decided better good pull kids school try reduce spread towns. said sent farm. asked long there? said, even know many years, saw almost one. said sounds horrible probably missed much, said always get want need. said, helped many people take measures. went say I'm old enough die matter, brings great sadness pandemic going. said, see young people dying people laughing it. said, happened polio one laughed life matter is. add, grandparents conservative understand massive complaints freedom people want. thought really interesting. said, younger generations learned sacrifices life includes. grandma said feel like deserve anything. thought back childhood. grandparents saved every ice cream pale, glass jar, scrap wood cause grew necessity. 

I guess glad someone pass lessons understand many people haven't. like share. 

Am scrutinizing everyone? No. Everyone struggles, struggled this. thought many times matter effect me. definitely felt lost depths especially loneliness pandemic. weird example always think quite trivial living apartment complex shared dryers. one would clean lint throw ground garbage far away. remember thinking matter someone else clean it? Well, thought felt everytime clean thought part matter small. stupid yes, applies life overall broader manner. Beyond this, tried part dryers. Well many one day one caught fire. nearly burned building 500 people it. Luckily someone happened walk past 2am see fire cause someone stole batteries smoke detector laundry room. Even small decisions make rippling impacts. 

Imagine collectively worked toward better common goal. could accomplish much society many retrospects willing make sacrifices. 

Everyone pretends like sacrifice freedoms this, freedom come without sacrifices?

Yes, become endemic. However, yet act like it? science catches much better place. Also, yes recognize fair people foolish getting vaccinated... makes us spiteful. wish death upon though? crossed mind many times truly healthy way think? lead even toxic climate Yeah, idea tried much success many government agencies corporations. 
Also devote time children's schooling phys ed., pay teachers more. money corn subsidies money this, also.   received Moderna booster yearly flu shot today. desk job daily commute, time left sport weekend (and gets old quick too).

I think way gyms onsite companies encouraged use them. example, get double salary per hour using 4 hours per week. 

Society run way right now.   Honestly point think everybody top bureaus fired pandemic officially over. Every single one, including Fauci. Every single time health officials could get right choose get wrong, almost universally. Heads roll.  They've seen too. People thought opened sports back up, packing people thousands large Outdoor arenas, going get major outbreaks. However, case. seem uptick cases events. presumed outdoors. Yeah, wait mostly infect others vaccine clinic combine side effects symptoms illness. tested negative feeling better fine get shot. point view disabled person, ""restrictions"" every country entire pandemic mild.

I'm told 7 years dont ""right"" sorts things people take granted, going shops whenever feel like it, going party dance night whatever, etc. get help go ""essential"" good services ""need live"" like food medical appointments. ""need"" go see live music live, ""essential"" etc etc.

When abled populace told ""essential"" needs, go without things go without, riots...

Society can't ways, OK people go without social life, sex life cultural life disabled people access that. OK shut disabled people room drip feed basic necessities life, wider population OK contain pandemic. Completely wears off? doesnt seem accurate. Honestly booster you’re likely better masking immunity still optimal since exposures help keep immunity stronger. course you’ll need get flu shot whatnot since viruses still exist. Ex-bleedin-actly.

Everyone talking vaccines, that's sideshow. Unless R number maintained 1 continue spread infect throughout community, population spreading ""don't feel ill"" guarantee mutate form evades vaccine - back square one endemic, deadly, disease.

This opportunity maintain enhance measures spread virus R number well 1 virus dies community - unable spread unable mutate further. zero cases open internal region.

Saying alternative nothing use force false dilemma. Bingo. insurance pays let's keep building there. Crazy.






It's bad folks keep building historical wildfire areas. Makes sense people think. real nightmare dealing insurance companies American hospital system.  Also, understand booster uptake skewed towards older people, might cause underestimate overall effectiveness know. calculus comes personal choice. quite possible choice annual booster annual infection. choice prefer, doubt many camps. I’m sorry 💔 work healthcare encountered multiple patients postpone needed (but immediately life-saving) surgeries hospital would admitted overrun COVID patients. It’s fair.  thought locked would weeks...

Turns never got lockdown, turns never got vaccine.

We got partial lockdown, partial vaccination, partially stopped pandemic.

And partially stopped continued.

If many morons country we'd done now, idiots literally killing country. hospital work know this? denied eua path corruption. Yes bridging study happening delays ridiculous. first time hit 1000 seemed like huge terrifying thing. everyday. film also failed properly anticipate hideous behaviour individuals governments too.

How fuck blindly trust 1000+ examples science action even finish drive work morning one? Got source? plus financial incentives/implications. vaxxed equals lose job? Higher insurance premiums? free COVID care? 

People tend comply hits bottom line. Would nice, yeah. honestly think CDC needs look metrics maybe reshuffle less focused ""cases"" focused hospitalizations deaths get winter. Both...but getting vaccinated chuckle fucks, getting vaccinated people can't get vaccinated. agree points huge part problem - also econ-related - food lobby manipulating USDA recommending many servings carbs. People told need eat like 14 servings pasta enough exercise walk 15 minutes pasta store week. 
Furthermore, there's lot people spend several hours week watching sports less hour playing sports exercising. put enough time money physical education teach children exercise without going gym. cancelled gym membership covid hit want get germs sweaty machines stuffy air, feel much better jog outdoors get sun.

My point, medically, distinguishing factor severity condition. arguing political beliefs bearing degree medical care receive. think opposite, everyone receive equal treatment matter believe. That's equitable.

Do believe equitable system? so, convince idea. Let know tiered medical system politics decide care would work. negative karma, asking really good question? get 3rd booster already.

Also throw Vermont low infection earlier lot numbers people never saw first place + add think one US’s oldest populations hospital numbers amazing pass catch covid 'fully' vaxxed person.

The vaccine gives _significantly_ protection catching overcoming COVID without it. barely comparable.

Even already caught COVID, immunity significantly higher go get vaccinated, too. agree last paragraph, facts facts.

I disagree following logic. dont want people divided fact (un)vaccination. believing dangerous, accepting that, connection last paragraph agree on, unvaccinated greater chance spreading virus developing serious symptoms. mean force vaccinated, believe better, less intrusive measures taken first. 

I dont problem example demanding everyday testing unvaccinated charging full cost hospital visits. want say. divide us more. Sometimes, hard sympathy people died preventable deaths. Agreed, looking back completely understand naïve think that. We're polarized world never possible unite issue. identity opposition other. really matter vaccination completely trivial thing.   RrmindMe! 1y  say masks help stop spread...? feel like position long (read: entire) time. say without pointing finger political affiliation particular. wait untill insurance companies start trying recoup costs ..

This going far-reaching consequences never see end lifetimes. that's great point need criminalize it...just add tax unvaccinated, like uninsured people. Also, cover covid medical cost unvaccinated. People what's right hits pocketbook. I’m saying people know happen able lead normal lives. similar (for them) suddenly needing needing glasses hearing aid. found ways adapt.

However doom easily avoided, poor countries risk future waves, vulnerable population completely vaccinated despite waning immunity, I'm pretty sure worse average double jabbed young person in, say, UK US. governments set priorities straight. First enough doses donated COVAX program, use boosters want.  wish government would force them. Like vaccinated police breaking pinning giving shot force. We’ve seen over. example, places allowed indoor eating reopen like November 2020. Cases went up. blamed indoor eating. Meanwhile cases naturally going go winter, rules set fail.  happened exact vaccine first two doses, getting third time. Although case Moderna third shot half dose previous ones.   Shut measures slowed things absolute initial wave. it’s BS certainly shit. People cram till 7:59 gotta leave head directly home! agree except filling hospitals. toddler’s MRI cancer canceled due unvaccinated filling up. get take spots us who’s children need treatment. Makes mad. in-laws friend died cancer last year able get treatment. Hospitals need stop admitting unvaccinated people. full stop, vaccine no, treatment, care live die, actions consequences. Low enough hospitalizations anyone needs medical care kind get it. forget 5 year olds can't get shot yet legitimately medically unable to.

Instead turning monster - impose sensible societal restrictions curb impact covid? Vaccination mandates state international borders instance mere inconvenience (for most) would real impact US. Pfizer first 2, got Moderna booster Friday afternoon. Knocked ass yesterday feel good today. reaction Covid vaccination (J&amp;J-1, Pfizer-2) nothing compared reactions Shingrix (Shingles) shots. minor discomforts still nothing compared remembering mother's recovering Shingles....what sad experience seeing suffering old age disease prevented vaccination.  It’s completely region dependent. virus spreads social groups, cities feel multiple waves virus “meets’ new people within city.

Get vaccinated boosted wear mask indoors around outside social group. Try avoid large indoor social gatherings much feel unpleasant so. Try friends vaccinated people.

The unfortunate reality doomed, sense eventually every single one us likely get virus next decade two. body’s response virus depend overall health, whether immune system practice recently.

You essentially choose level risk life, isn’t beautiful!  let people die based intelligence susceptibility mind games Facebook? would mean fake vaccine cards? could teach empathy instead petty revenge prevalent society? that's borderline genocide? 300lb people, smokers, drunk drivers get treatment too? doctors take oath help even like opinions?

Or America government somehow 10 times shit show used allowed told believe ""we"" simply better ""they"" are. way stop divisive start empathize different. narrative? follow directions helped defiantly ignore them? We've listened whine every plan bring virus control. We've listened 2 years. 2 years, whined lockdowns, masks, social distancing, vaccines. two years, pushed back everything. Wanting nothing fellow person demanding entitled equal share limited resources. That’s fair point; enough people get symptoms within days vaccination, could look infections progress relative general public. would enough people make comparison worthwhile. 
I hope remain well, thanks advance getting boosted.  Yup. Exactly going say. virus mortality rate like Ebola? would antivax movement. would lottery system get people.  can’t even rush ER rooms doctors see patients in. triage bays full BH patients, I’m running portable oxygen tanks covid/chf pt lobby management wants us hand snack bags wait time 12h.  Meanwhile pt hall beds orders nurses enact orders. We’ve given docs access med cabinet line, lab, medicate. course refuse “that’s nursing’s job”. Unfortunately shit load dumbasses.

Just guess though.  want explain COVID? Last checked care suppose do. Illinois it’s 58% adults. Doesn’t include teenagers (last number read 30’s), numbers 5-11 yet. keeps spreading like crazy way we’re near bigger city.

Some friends live small town school nurse doesn’t believe covid. bad guess here. agree.

Unvaccinated people choosing take risk. accept responsibility. Freedom comes responsibility. would trust something simply it’s Facebook. absolutely doesn’t mean people really dying booster left right center. asking question future. inherently unknown unless we've invented time travel missed it. I'm sorry. feel you. bad 99.9999% world don’t care ignore scientists listen woke conspiracy theorists take ivermectin instead vaccines treat COVID. Spoken like anti-vaxxer. 

There MUCH PROOF works.  work they're hauled E.R can't answer.   Vermont entering delta wave. booster compliance helps most, point.  Covid has? sound ridiculous, I’m sorry.  We've taking climate change test ~30 years now. Thinking time act soon part problem: time act generation ago. Every day wasted day cost achieve desirable outcome becomes harder expensive.

I'm fairly certain making mistake internally, language use implies think that's part issue. Yes, read last night. found pretty hard believe Vermont hit hard, especially good vaccination rate.

“There 2,300 beds available Ontario's ICU wards typical day..” 

And “Ontario approximately 2,300 total ICU beds…”

And across Canada total, “We identified 286 hospitals 3170 ICU beds 4982 mechanical ventilators critically ill patients.” difference.

Unfortunately, number un-vaccinated nutjobs sits closer 40% 10. am, go ask around guy. mean tennis player, Novak Djokovic. It’s 90% vaccinated. 58% country. it’s almost low 40% states. Keep mind localized problems - areas overloaded hospitals awful vaccination rates others it’s mostly business usual vax rate high. 

In reality numbers likely even worse. almost year past first wave vaccinations many early ones wearing off. going reliant people getting boosters certain booster rates suck compared 58% we’ve achieved initial doses.

Lockdowns point feasible solution protested heavily. sure it’s actual ICUs (intensive care units) people hospitals? everything I’ve read even people waning immunity much better prognosis end hospiral  hate break you, lot 10% unvaccinated choice unfortunately. 

Keep mind long political system (in US) deliberately overrepresents minority, thanks Senate electoral college, minority catered to. I’m sorry you’re going though this. also live rural area infection rate low time pandemic. now. it’s higher ever, lots vaxxed people sick. work nursing home. send ill resident (not covid) hospital week - resident sent back waiting many hours ER, room person admitted. sad.

She one ""better"" cancers successfully operated nodules lungs needed removed via cutting edge treatment, consultant agreed suitable candidate - Radiofrequency ablation therapy anyone wants explore further, might find helpful.

Then due pandemic clinic closed several months. back up, nodules grown treatment longer suitable, died.

The fact several vaccines fact millions millions world without side effects yet people still refuse clog health systems already breaking point due backlog non Covid related cases put top list ICU makes blood boil.

Being vaccinated stop contracting Covid, small sample size 3 people keeps hospital even importantly ICU.

No, dumbasses either A: think they're superman act irresponsibly B: believe virus' existence.

I may unvaccinated idiots going parties, getting fights people masks, egregious shit making rest us look bad

Some us go work, go shopping go home. feel people turning (the situation vaccinated vs unvaccinated) another reason hate people. surprised lunatics try say 2nd class citizens point either. much division? there's shitheads make tougher us mean everyone gotten shot blame (this ain't aimed OP rather anyone blames unvaccinated problems troublemakers). Joe Rogan Yajirobi presumably. 🤣 They’re exactly fucking thing again. There’s excuse this.  views human condition alarm most.

Even someone who's pretty misanthropic already I'm surprised far opinion human beings plummeted. individuals, that's actually gone up, whole groups. rest... really think previously optimistic fellows. suppose that's case.

Honest sympathies hip. count inconceivably lucky able get cancer surgery shit hit fan. Even risk chemo vaccine - recognition many ""this real"" - pales compared could turned out. wish could sympathies sadly that's world have, sorry. :( make use QR codes mandatory though accept kind proof people vaccinated. least Germany case kind doubt happen. still numerous people smartphone one old software required QR passcodes run them. course many vaccinated. 90 per cent elderly people vaccinated vaccines reduce risk going ICU (not limiting it) lots people vaccinated ICU.

Look way: 

There's village 100 people. 90 vaccinated. 10 vaccinated. 10 people ICU, 5 vaccinated 5 vaccinated. News might report: 50/50 ICU, half vaccinated, half aren't.

But need look population. 5/10 unvaccinated example ICU, 5/90 vaccinated.

That's people fail interpret pandemic correctly. Math intuitive average people.  SIL loves TX still comparing Covid flu. I’ve tried everything think bad experience vaccine won’t get covid jab let niece get one. Thankfully brother work. get frustrated talking her. worry lot she’s cancer survivor higher risk. think mistaking reaction unvaccinated, took cue simply ignore mask rules. 

It's shame asked. 

Sure, CDC thought Americans neighbors. thought capacity lie.
They didn't. Fauci entire CDC. made many smart, scientific, medical professionals walks life. decision his. 

*If* elderly members may exposed - may die - it. Simple.   Right? many vacced Karens already partying potentially killing unvacced people wear masks day stay away them. tired risking life people think vaccine makes immune death.       500 pages per month… ten employees…

That’s 50 pages per employee per month…

So like 2 pages per employee per day?

So takes employee 4 hours prepare page public release? 🤔 friend who’s needed plates vertebrae fused…something involving spine long covid thing. lives antivax area apparently know he’s constant pain every day it’s taking toll. appointments keep getting moved canceled though covid it’s elective guess makes sense since he’s basically crippled it. I’d really like see getting needs little hope way everything structured nowadays. 
If nurses read thanks don’t let assholes drag down! see flu waves every year, it’s manageable (endemic) level harm, yearly pandemic Without even reading I’m going guess: youth, tons outdoors sunlight, humid air, high vax % ""As November 15, 2021, White people accounted largest share (60%) people unvaccinated.""

Keep mind, whites **majority**. even percentage, difference Overall, across 43 states, November 15, 2021, 56% percent White people received least one COVID-19 vaccine dose, close rate Hispanic people (54%) higher rate Black people  live Rochester people wear masks anymore even though considered ""med city."" disappointing me. like tax would based income. vaccine free.   US currently averaging close 1,000 COVID deaths day US. Keep average 3-4 months (higher peak lower back end) get 100K-150K COVID deaths 

Average flu season 35K-50K - that’s endemic level 

It probably take couple years get way true endemic level, adding immunity, optimizing vaccine dosing schedule, better therapeutics &amp; treatment. last winter deaths, new normal  FL low cases now? They’re sharing people died getting booster they’re sharing context assuming death occurred booster, 2 related. know anyone thinks physician without privileges hospital write orders hospital. hard enough getting existing prescriptions administered hospital   representative poll published today 52 % Germans making Covid vaccination mandatory everyone. 41 % it. 7 % unsure make statement.  movie, hospitals actual drills receiving vaccine shipments securely distributing (among many crisis drills run)   Honestly, think it’s time governments places vaccine readily available stop reporting making decisions based cases start making based hospital capacity. feel bad people medically can’t get vaccine, point need acknowledge virus endemic get back daily lives. find hard muster sympathy people choose get vaccinated really super important parts life lives vaccinated friends family still shambles protect them. Yeah want make medical decisions instead doctors, need go legislature Texas Tbf, case us Europe. get mine June. mine yesterday; tech said vaccine half dose.  tried masking syringe crayon?  given data CDC FDA have

That's key part quoted. Israeli data clearly showed waning thus need booster. Pfizer said data showed same. said, Fauci doubted dismissed data. CDC director admitted press conference. CDC used data that's weeks date base decisions on. use ""real time"" data. Israeli data was.

Which another point irony. Fauci summer doubted data coming Israel. touts it. often cites Israel justify position. cannot understand unvaccinated health personnel allowed anywhere near patients first place. believe science threat patients, get fuck out.  supposed show ID along proof vax/recovery QR code scanned shows name DOB. several EU countries enforced (more less, official system). showing friend's QR code longer flies. 

A much bigger problem people bribed corrupt medical personnel put national database vaxxed people receiving genuine vax certificate (to able travel, go restaurants events etc) despite actually vaccine. likely happening every EU country. like idiots got heart attack fat? like attitude ;) Honestly same. thought antivaxxer type thing like 8% population thing sadly found population way bigger thought ever heard people hospital procedures delayed dying get emergency care hospital overflowing sick smokers? haven't, happening covid. That's difference. Right. Small pox first vaccine, course people bit scared it. really, back things could go horribly wrong. don’t blame people yesteryear hesitant
I blame people today, though. patience would worn thin well treat them. It’s unvaccinated misinformed also tend rather mean arrogant it. attitudes make rather tough compassion them. hope kicked soon confessed plenty first world countries don’t really trust roll vaccines. It’s whole logistics mess. Tbh though, wasn’t able get booster shot country sending vaccines others elsewhere, yea would little upset. priority citizens first, providing aid countries ban everyone hospitals. way free icu beds. remember walking 1917 saying ""This going last time we're going movie theatre years"". Everyone thought nuts. Good fucking god.  hide tissue symptoms? Jesus. unvaccinated? sick need beds?

About 54% hospital admittances covid Ireland vaccinated people. see lot misinformation sort stuff. Even though roughly half patients hospital vacvinated media kept reporting unvacvinated filling beds.

End day vaxed sick people need medical treatment.   also left permanent scar spot administered (usually upper arm).  Thanks good wishes. I'm sure I'm downvoted asking sincere question.   Call stupid want. im fully vacinated now. thoght got worried end. Firstly hate chemicals injected body feels super fking odd unsafe.

So question is. studies sperm count male infertility comes vacine? mean late go back now...

But still worries me. sure call idiot skeptic on. allowed question things! truly worried this.  Buddy, get head - one likes him. Deal it. problem they’re taking others  Reagan, Murdoch, Gingrich, Cheney, Zuckerberg, Thiel, Trump bunch others happened. whole mess long time making. Yeah fair enough   Cases high state. Hospitals also capacity.

That's problem. I’ve experience issues(not Covid related) week tried get see doctor. can’t get see another 30+ days. tried go ER one approximately 5+ hour wait, something thah likely isn’t ER matter cost minimum $500 per visit. 

So pain ass won’t go away can’t get hospital/treatment due largely anti-vaccinated nimwits taking space.

Sure, could wait 5 hours ER way justify waiting 5 hours spending $500.  third shot 103 degree fever six days, connective tissue became super unstable (ehlers danlos), started shortness breath debilitating chest pains diarrhea. dimer elevated, ekg fairly normal ct scans clear. soon got labs tossed immediately. asked steroids stop autoimmune storm ignored me. Never saw doctor again. diagnosis.

Luckily last time got steroids (after face blew second shot) pharmacist paying attention doubled prescription, took course. fever broke couple hours after, woke drenched sweat, symptoms disappeared two days. Still weeks later taping joints coaxing body making better collagen.          Either one fine. General guidance stick got originally. There’s small amount evidence one might infer moderna ever slightly better Pfizer, personally I’m convinced there’s meaningful difference comes boosting. person chronic health condition weakens immune system, really excited gather holidays non vaxxed SIL.

Anyone else navigate holidays anti anti-vaxxers? case don’t bother read article, vax rate 94% Good point. seem like NE states west coast enjoyed tossing shame Texas SE. shaming unnecessary hard deal with. can’t imagine shaming Europe right now. Things sound rough hope get things back track. Nope. That's false equivalence.      concerns science sincere. There’s point trying address were.

It’s simply political. people oppose everything democrats say important even that’s plainly true best interest. can’t pro vaccine you’re vaccine. 

“When pathogen potentially dangerous” mean like pathogen killed 1 every 500 people US? 

And what’s issue dangerous? vaccine contains whole virus. isolated protein spike derived covid virus used vaccine makes impossible cause actual infection. dangerous exposing body tested, safe, effective dose harmful virus, stimulate body’s natural defense system? Yes, know cases sick enough require hospitalization. 

The ones know elderly significant health problems.  Damn! sucks     one too, barely noticeable, small discoloration. People parents' generation often something looks like moon crater though. start like countries. Adult? vaccinated? valid medical excuse? Sorry, COVID coverage you.  addicts given hearts? Alcoholics given livers? Smokers given lungs? They’re sicker need healthier people need transplant organs. condition severe, shouldn’t we’re prioritize them? 

Refusing vaccine action, choice refuse personal responsibility, affecting collective responsibility. It’s addict.  Judge away Reddit. 

I pulled daughter preschool March 2020 quit job stay home her. husband works home, got vaccinated ASAP got boosters. get groceries delivered, don’t eat restaurants, don’t travel, haven’t haircut 2 years.

Public health leaders politicians went war unbeatable army: virus. hubris imagined declared winner COVID turn, created fallacy us eliminate it. 

Historically, science eliminated one virus: smallpox. anyone think could eliminate COVID, coronavirus’ notoriously difficult manage?  tradition. *not counting 18's.

I'm grateful they're willing part hope feel welcome California.  know got downvoted. I'm pro vaccine anyone possibly be. Even bad optics.

Preliminary data expected December though Correct yes, EXACTLY. Former scientist here: papers peer reviewed prior publication. committee experts field, similar research author read paper ask questions validity giving pass fail.

The way decide parts Bible follow not. 

They're hypocrites. I'll interested see happens UK, particularly England decision taken 'get with' extent summer.

England much derided last months approach, right looking like right one Well wait less week Thanksgiving expand booster eligibility then….  people held covid parties could get natural immunity  ingest natural organic things .... *snorts substance stranger festival* Yep, biggest thing pandemic many countries governments willing literally kill people money. live Chicago traveled NYC week (my first plane trip since pre-lockdown). interesting see differences. New York, show vaccine card every single time go somewhere. Restaurants. Work meetings. Hotel lobby. Concert venue. Lunch. Bar. surprising. since everyone vaccinated, almost everyone took mask.

For me, Chicagoan, jarring see mask-free. sure personal experience, everyone see Chicago seems masked, except maybe 1-2 there. wonder terms coming wave, throughout city? Spotted among unvaccinated non-boosted? see... really. vaccine curb spread enough completely eliminate virus. That's fact missing waited vaccine. Even waited reopen, widespread put back bottle. think human race going last long?  use england guide, 150- 200 deaths day average (being deaths within 28 days positive test) 30,000 -50,000 cases day population c 60m seems acceptable.

They're explicitly making references certain dates, know recent! $$$  Strange. don’t recall ever hearing shortages before, even pandemic years.  could also dysautonomia, virus known damaging nerves charge automatic bodily functions difference longer caring risk over. conflating two. it’s over, longer care resumed normal activity bearing end, except maybe extend it.  anyone else catch it?  association probably still holds, many European countries struggle obesity. See: UK. curfews movement restrictions really scientific….

I think last year proved us artificially suppress spread. Holy shit, even look Australia: strictest restrictions past 6 months Sydney/Melbourne putting huge (for them) numbers daily.

Explain one. recognize can’t source size population 12, 2016 census, irelands (country quote reference to) population 14 20% total population, extrapolated ~5m total population 1,000,000. would mean 90% 4m unvaccinated claimed 10% people 12 not, equal 400,000. we’ll say 1.4m unvaccinated knowledge young age portion extremely unlikely catch hospitalized Covid. 

So clarify context article above. Using source Gallup, unvaccinated hospitalization risk &lt;1%. even use 1% epidemic (assuming hospital capacity Ireland referencing main subject burden) presumably caused &lt;14000 people, knowing figure 70% people age 14, that’s figure found available per 2016 census, amount already Covid hospitalized. find interesting broken Suck it, Novaxx Djokovic. much winning Grand Slam.   times past years shortages asked people wait elderly/immunocompromised people get flu shot first. remember years happened. 

The problem don’t good job differentiating every year don’t give timeline others get it, people don’t. remember next year.  True, read new Pfizer drug needs taken early. time can’t breathe, might late. hope I’m wrong. Lucky. I've 2 pharmacies, neither available. One even flu shots walk-ins, appointments booked solid two weeks. Absolutely wild completely made last part difference can't breathe covid, late get vaccine. Well, guess point. already plenty health reasons lose weight problem still big even added incentives..  actually right right thing avoid infecting people. Throw stones want advice I've given thread try positive. That's assuming pill works well, affordable, people want ""experimental treatment,"" people accept covid real, treament necessary, finally, people afford going dr seek treatment. Unvaccinated something like 12+ times likely end hospital. Boosters reduce risk even more. Vaccinations better solution, collective punishment people already taken effective measure possible protect others.  [this posted top comment pointed median age Africa 19.7.  Maybe, guess we'll know years.

We've also recently discovered gene seems double risk death. might genetic risk factors discovered future, could useful target at-risk population. approved Thanksgiving: done Halloween kids go out!

Bottom line, there's winning. I’m skeptical. format inward questioning given countless fits restlessness also awards naacp went Republican. pass legislation probably release nonviolent drug offenders President lifetime. passed first step act. Declared KKK others terrorist organizations.

But honestly, think he’s racist random country club douchebag. think he’d makes racial joke like overtly dick people based race. CERTAINLY racist Joe Biden (who CLEARLY said done soem racist shit…even recently.)

Trump wasn’t nearly anti-gay racist Biden lifetime. MEDIA try maximize much possible divide country? Yes. Yes, did. thoughts exactly Hand up: moderate leaning Republican. 

I can’t blame Biden. way didn’t blame Trump. stupid virus unlike anything we’ve ever seen. mismanaged? Absolutely! things stood out: 

1) many immunologists, doctors, non-immunologists doctors believed whose opinion respected, speaking making recommendations. everyone opinion mother’s friend’s cousin heard news x, someone else heard y. 

2) media trigger happy release news. world literally shut down, nothing else report on. Fauci doctors pestered making recommendations, sometimes prematurely, literally hint news spun out. 

3) virus happened election year. Don’t get started con$piracy theories, politicized beyond belief. Kamala wouldn’t take vaccine Trump recommended it; Cuomo wouldn’t accept vaccines Trump; Trump denying severity COVID, etc etc. genuinely believe happened mid term wouldn’t dealt half political divisiveness led vaccine hesitancy. say hesitancy you’re simply changing mind anti vaxxers. fiasco level ""masks work, need wear masks.""

It clear since summer 2 doses close together (or one) provide lasting immunity infection. Instead gaslighting us several months dragging feet could explained happening plain English told us options fixing problem. 

Instead, whole process add fuel anti-vax fire (breakthrough infections large scale undermined public confidence reliability COVID vaccines CDC) .

The fact people deceptive order get third doses Delta burned control absolutely tragic. much misery could avoided FDA/CDC scientists trying deny reality months?

Suck up. boosters! they're testing less they're missing tons cases.

They're dying less they're even testing dead people properly. countries excess death statistics, huge discrepancy.

But course Africa also much younger continent, lowers death rate.  simple. Every country looked first lot messes would lessened.  Uh, flu vaccine That's true  policy blunder. much expertise available areas, considering Matrix-level marketing relentlessly exposed to? exploited authorities common good, instead merely squeeze another buck us poor herd animals? math correct, EXCEPT assumes vaccine efficacy 100%. 

Example: virus R0 6, vaccine 80% effective, 100% vaccination mathematically enough bring R0 1. Probably, could end losing way much weight would unhealthy. COVID19 endemic, global disease.

You keep saying this. false. endemic disease constantly maintained stable equilibrium near baseline level. definition R0 * ~= 1

IF give allow disease take course, overload hospitals mass death. We're getting close overloading hospitals Netherlands we've trying half-assed fashion fight COVID. simply stopped, things would even worse.

What plan? Mostly psychological. Facial expressions significant part non verbal communication people respond dying covid not? allergies? mrna vaccines use polyethylene glycol, rather common chemical usually injected directly body, manufacture. PEG allergies usually know first dose.

No vaccine uses allergins, though people severe allergies tend lot them. That's starting play words now. 

Mild mild inconvenience. might feel good going stop things normally do.

My covid symptoms slight temp, headache, little weakness sore joints. covid still would went work every day symptoms had. health officials opportunity lead fell flat reasons never understand.

The thing tempers anger agencies politicians trying intentionally corrupt work. probably know happened behind scenes time, create internal policy procedure around that, put certain posture.

I still agree completely, though. try remind things going can't fully appreciate right now. I'm sure we'll get explanation *eventually.* However, really change anything now. sad. mention scary possibly dangerous. house could fire would never smell smoke. Hogan front start Maryland, superb management day one. yet local implementation boosters old folks laggard, due pointless bureaucracy, would think little urgency. finally insist 92-year-old mother break ranks go get booster local pharmacy flu season hit. 

It four weeks later finally set clinic people residence. management place frothing mouth frustration point; lot residents doctors, children also doctors, bet lot heat. Dang joker finally met match Even testing less, testing sick? data positivity rate? One would think would sky high.

By way, also dying less.  Well said thank responses. 

I hope mRNA technology, stop yearly boosters. virus lol. 

I gladly continue part. booster continue mask indoors around others. think frustration CDC WH made decisions FDA did, put pressure FDA rubber stamping disregard safety concerns. choice either things safe fast.

There concerns, example paper recently published mentions full spike protein could inhibit cells self repair mechanism. sure long matters test done vitro vivo. Stuff like could reason give booster. OP right, change story “guaranteeing” they’ll extend vaccinated people too?  say twitter report, report linked twitter. published, comes reputable source.

""NY governor tells companies bring workers office full time."" catch lose sense fully vaccinated then? (2 shots?) long after? Mhmm. Got Covid Aug 2020 almost quit job 10 years couldn’t get bed brain fog made driving fucking blindfolded Mario Kart adventure sometimes. Wouldn’t wish anyone. much agree sentiment, plenty cases coming vaxxed 6+ months ago. I'm sure want booster shot every 6 months rest life.

If sense normality (i.e. going restaurants baseball game) requires vaccinating, I'm willing take vaccine every six months needed. either live worse restrictions either vaxxed vaxxed long time ago. plenty cases coming vaxxed 6+ months ago.

Cases happen vaxxed people well, shown Delta came. thing hospitalizations risk death cut. Sure, hospitalizations may rise that, hands vaxxed take boosters well. Israel worked, since last wave settled quickly.

I understand people took vaccine ago, antivaxxers done part since beginning frustrates me. last straw would Merck/Pfizer pill came still trust it. 

So vaccines, treatment? beyond lost cause. know lady got vaccine Ethiopian Community Development Center, weeks anyone else, said like 80% people line whites woman lol. wanted give disadvantaged word got social media. drove 4 hours Appalachians get dose. swimming excess vaccines there, hard get resided.   high vaccine rate combined vaccine passports kept Canada open last 6 months

\- age grounds G1 Gn, state health authority provide treatment complications arising Covid-19 infection. 


Hell, even go far refusing treatment. could simply say triage required, may deprioritized. 


At end day, person decide want mitigate risk. Ideally, get vaccine. maybe never leave house. Maybe nothing end getting disease (and like people experience nothing day feeling kinda shitty).  


FYI: CFR Covid 2%; that's enough scare people compliance hope gets better soon.

Mercifully COVID presents low risk children, figures UK last checked 2 million COVID fatalities children put perspective road fatalities children around 20 million, however, none consolation child one two million. [About 95% effective symptomatic presumably delta time initial studies gave 90% wild type. massive improvement. directly tell us it'll allow herd immunity since test participants asymptomatic infection. seems like large part population gets boosted might finally ""rein in""

The place watch Iceland 81% double vaccinated [boosting I'd expect boosted population quickly get 70% vaccination rate 4 months ago.

Then we'll see. don’t enough vaccinated people right made vaccination mandatory Austria.

Also, it’s claimed protestors resorting said Friday three young Austrians Linz admitted planned ambush police officers planned protests, given dissatisfaction tighter restrictions. two teenagers 20-year-old said also intended set officers fire, DPA news agency reported. It’s hard tell because, said, someone vaccinated got Covid could worse symptoms weren’t vaccinated can’t rewind time test out. see 90% people hospitalized dying right unvaccinated, here’s study showing vaccinated breakthrough infections 20 times les likely hospitalized. study showing vaccinated breakthrough infections half likely result long Covid.   myocarditis mostly ruled kids. Also, even large scale studies among adults rates 2/100,000. know causes TONS inflammation 

You’re seriously equating twitter shit published studies? OK. Brain worms. indeed bit true suppose, complaints quite mild like cold. 

That said we're also still twenties healthy. 

I really surprised though see us getting despite vaccinated. Since usually vaccine means chance getting WAY smaller use Epic. admit, it’s intake. remains chart. also passed along handoff. correct. cdc lists people allergic ingredient vaccine outright exclusion criteria. top that, chance someone allergic ingredient three vaccines quite close zero. Now, could legitimate reason doctor may want patient take specific, extremely unique reason? Yes, it’s possible. vast vast vast majority people, condition prevents getting vaccine. It’s also morally wrong get vaccinated entire world hostage. 0 sentiment people would shed tears dies think vaccines terribly misunderstood. get infected virus, despite 3 shots, I’ll whatsoever surprised. matters hospitalizations deaths. disease (Covid 19) matters. truly believe right thing getting vaccines. It’s encouraged family they’ve done. I’m one person one experience, internet stranger boot, understanding fibromyalgia specific, one thing. means doctor acknowledges issue group something called “fibromyalgia”, opposed fibromyalgia specific thing. 

I mention part treated Lyme disease told clearly fibromyalgia immediately get Lyme disease test

Good luck Health! Health everything! don’t magical delayed side effects. usually see side effects immediately soon after.

But vaccines different class. use mRNA never tried before. know side effects occur, seem issues myocarditis nuerological problems reported.. main argument think partially effective vaccine might require long term boosters demands mandatory side effect would expect would ADE, we’ve seen ZERO that.

None proven. minor reports ADE might slight issue. might something N protein. report twitter (I can't find source) seemed suggest antibodies N protein important people want vaccine works. ADE, enough neutralizing antibodies completely incapacitate virus, might lead slightly enhanced effect. might also take place waning antibodies. research seem complete yet. ADE may worry, data seems convincing vaccine could less 50% efficacy within 2 many childhood vaccines became mandatory within years less released. 

The polio vaccine released 1955 fully eradicated US 1979. 24 year gap. I'm sure mandated initially, 5 year thing. Happy corrected. posting misinformation?

I mostly tired chorus “VACCINES DON’T WORK” clearly do. almost certainly need make 3 shot series monitor. don’t think would morally right.

We treat people self-inflicted injuries medical conditions. Take example life long smoker, known decades high risk lung cancer continue habit anyway, still offer treatment think rightly so. think misread said. said paying attention world news American trait (and yes I’m aware that’s exclusive USA). Smallpox case fatality rate (CFR) 30-60%. Compare 2% Covid. 


Not mention, smallpox inoculation enjoyed much longer clinical history mandated. Compare w/ Covid vaccines yet two years data.  


Germany (okay, Austria culturally similar) survey people vaccinated (Robert Koch Institute it). main reasoning (from 70% people) risks Covid appear outweigh possible (or yet proven impossible) risks getting vaccine. 


You reason people topic, need understand objections skirt around apples oranges argument ""bUt SmAllpoX!"" posting lot misinformation thread. What's agenda? share experience. think since vaccine immunity wanes (as natural immunity, course) boosters extremely important. know bothers lot people. kinda refuse emotions anymore. I’m tired. crap I’ve seen people go result virus can’t really done justice simple words. I’ve seen people die shouldn’t stretch, young fit healthy. Delta extra. many patients young men. It’s extremely upsetting. know people doubt vaccines certainly doubt say. I’m nobody. know I’ve seen. Wish everyone could come work shift. People die slowly much time. Many success stories live go home bunch absolutely debilitating new conditions. mandate workers yet, we’ve lost ton healthcare workers since started. sucks. Percussive anesthesiology still relevant specialty. One million people US semi-permanent possibly permanent loss smell...  Ivermectin also uses, third ain't it.  Maybe concern-trolled boosters necessary, new surge might avoided, least minimized... Seems like triggered zombies.  think whatever want.   happy live US god.  Figures UK show 90%+ population COVID antibodies (with around 70% vaccination rate), people UK either vaccine virus. sure US similarly tracks antibodies Look LSD well. Good. restrictions egregious. It’s two years. Vaccines available. Move on. semantics partner got covid despite double vaxxed. Later I've learned college likely gave also fully vaxxed. googled 'life expectancy Africa' first bullet ""The average life expectancy Canada peer countries—among richest world—is 81 years. **People Africa live, average, age 54**, people Southeast Asia live age 65""

According worldometer, 75% covid deaths occurred people age 65. 

So reason Africa lower death rate older people already died? Oh shoot. Thanks info! say rest world American, rather minorities lean right rest world greatly influenced via social media American antivaxxer movement. also kamala flat public health professionals, Dr. [Anthony] Fauci, doctors tell us take it, I’ll first line take it. Absolutely,” Harris said live debate Salt Lake City, asked Americans take vaccine, Trump administration approve one either election. **“But Donald Trump tells us take it. I’m taking it.”**

extremely terrible messaging, right disagrees anything biden says vaccines/boosters, left loses minds it.

can't cake eat Absolutely get vaccine gets approved children, also 3 1 year old course take whatever precautions think necessary children also keep mind low risk COVID children. UK COVID deaths children around 2 million, quite low considering it’s 20 million motor vehicle fatalities among children, ten times less dangerous vehicles.

Mercifully COVID fairly innocuous children. got Pfizer April, actually tested positive today breakthrough case. I've mild-to-moderate cold past 2 weeks, negative PCR test week ago.

I think I've seen guidance booster timeline. already planning get January, since next 3 weeks crazy busy work significant immune response second shot back April, want miss time work/Christmas/New Year's. still make sense? breakthrough case delay (or pull forward) booster shot timing? “tiny bit different” drug approval process. Even small label changes new indication require trials review. healthcare workers work hospital? hospital's policy notifying coworkers covid infections? course get notified patient tests positive, hospital telling us colleagues getting sick. I'm hearing things grapevine instead. also on-site testing available. stipulations hospital locality notifying coworkers felt exposures/contacts?  Alaska State Medical Board opened complaints nine medical providers licensed state involving concerns misinformation surrounding COVID-19 treatments.

The complaints involve seven physicians, one physician assistant, one advanced practice registered nurse, according Sara Chambers, director state Division Corporations, Business Professional Licensing, provides staffing medical board.

An opened complaint intake status based information received public imply finding guilt innocence, Chambers said. providers publicly identified. demand medical cocaine. Nationwide vaccination rate well 75% still, I'm sure get point VRBPAC meeting boosters 2 months ago. voted favor boosters adults, could vast majority adults boosted Thanksgiving holiday. Instead, bowed pressure ""vaccine equity"" nonsense scrambling reverse course. Thousands deaths hands. Don’t forget CDC screwed covid testing early due hubris. feel like complicated is, check things cause. Like mind, modify shape receptor something along lines (pardon virologist here) make sure doesn’t reason latch shit shouldn’t etc cause issues. seems even experts it’s complicated shit, tbh, still always learning complexities human body. way gain info trial it, give people, see happens course using theoretical knowledge designing best idea possible won’t anything negative. wild human body, things still happen; hence trials testing see actual results outcomes might be. never said them, said unexpected people would oppose them. Forcing holiday shoppers shop shorter time frame surely limit virus, right? 

Closing 6pm arbitrary non-scientific. COVID19 care time is.  literally asked purposes lockdowns was.

It would easy look instead badgering us. Rudely.

Here Netherlands, issue 200,000+ new COVID cases last two weeks, numbers continue increase, 54,000 hospital beds whole country.

Hospitals preparing go ""Code Black"" going leave die due lack treatment.

Now, us really want people die corridors overloaded hospitals, lockdowns.

I'm sort missing coming from. better solution fact new cases hospital system handle? care lot people die due lack medical treatment? 

Or (my theory) actually know situation like comment.  think “they,” presume mean world’s scientific community, don’t know anything?

We know lot virus accompanying disease, much beginning. time gone by, we’ve learned surface contamination far less concern shared air, sorts important things. 

Unfortunately, virus mutated Delta variant, means used protect us infection, mostly protects us hospitalization death. need boosters, bring protection infection back levels initially saw first variant. 

The nature scientific knowledge requires change new information comes light. fact understanding new virus changed time mean scientists “don’t know anything,” quite opposite. It’s evidence we’re learning improving understanding things gather evidence. Agreed understood! would tougher sell, mRNA vaccines would still approved, based excellent safety profile. risk/benefit calculation pretty clear, even waning immunity symptomatic infection, prevention progression hospitalization huge benefit. can't totally immune virus. yes need vaccination still need care still ways vaccinated person contract virus... thought ppl auto immune disease capable taking vaccine immune system (after reading comments) looks like ppl allergic reaction towards vaccine capable getting it. kind research theme? Would really interesting. Agreed points. Still lockdown Smokers diabetics overwhelming ICUs causing health care workers resign fatigue.

I'm sure agree deny care, think insurance cover covid care people choose unvaccinated.  Limiting ""non-essential shops"" certain hours odd mitigation strategy.

Instead 200 people shopping store across 12 hours open, 200 people shop store across 8 hours. Seems like forcing people shop shorter hours, especially holiday season like we're now, increase likelihood people close proximity.

It also makes seem COVID19 affect business 5:59pm 6:01pm virus go wild. Really, that's completely arbitrary cut scientific.

I think we're point politicians endorsing strategies political, scientific rationale countries.  Children 12 main way virus transmitting rising amount nations. 

To claim vaccines work without ever vaccinated young children unsubstantiated claim. got married Nola weeks ago. They’re enforcing shit. really needed, definitely worth waiting for. , non essential surgeries cancelled. Half people ICUs unvaccinated represent 7% population. 

But they'll still claim half vaccinated proves vaccine work.

A child died recently due cardiac arrest sport (hurling) blame vaccine even though we've similar deaths years vaccine. 95% *up to* 1.6 million people (highest bound) olfactory dysfunction likely recover sense smell, based natural history olfactory dysfunction. 

But still technically true one 1.6 million ""possibly permanent"" loss smell. sense 300,000,000 Americans possibly permanent mortality car crash year. 

I pointed response headline massively downvoted. Weird. care idiots victims final days? let keep taking friends families them? know vaccines wanning thought MRNA would prevent that. Hello Netherlands! hospitals planning go #CodeZwart, Code Black, beds. means they're going putting people hallways, eventually, they're going forced let people die without treatment.

I personally think mass carnage hospital system wildly overloaded bad thing. might care much mass death, though.

Oh, explain planned restrictions like? feel government nowhere near enough. Getting everyone first shot important getting third shot.  literally reason exist; worry people getting sick. Perhaps Trump shown consistent record bigotry, closing air travel would called racist. Plug president Trump accusations racism move would ring extremely hollow.

And right whinges point constantly, ever cared accusations racism left except double it?    vocal ones tiny subset relatively. There's another large group get vaccinated screaming easily swayed. try it. luck.  ego, Biden administration assumed would rubber stamp request.  Get angry responsible engel bidet FvD rest wappies. keep locked home rest us free.  That's I'm trying understand. point lawsuits? purely political statement something else going on? trying force doctors treat medicine could check take themselves. ah yes let's take advice dude quote ""saw anime thought cool""... Secondary immune responses give much higher level antibody, decay slower. linear, level higher amount. We'll see time. Peter Hotez, one top vaccinologists US, thinks 3rd dose may give several years protection. Others say we'll need yearly boosters. we're certainly going need one six months. People hear booster six months assume means EVERY six months. That's secondary immune responses work. European countries around 70% vaccinated. That’s lowest range herd immunity estimated Delta emerged. They’ve got get vaccinated numbers up, including younger kids now, you’ll see numbers decreasing. Still won’t stop virus - vaccines usually don’t eradicate virus - cut effected virus really cut number deaths hospitals. think less enforcement attitude. New Orleans ""anything goes"" feeling lot people (on Bourbon Street, primarily), especially game days. Weekenders surrounding areas south drive know totally cut loose, usual consequences; ""carnival"" year long Bourbon Street.

So, making policy says, effect, ""Don't expect get away attitude times. We've screwed hard covid, bullshit.""

And really screwed hard: first city get serious epidemic spread, largely thanks reassurances received national officials Mardi Gras 2020. still pissed that. course. easy see people feel like they've duped it. Get vaccine pandemic get vaccine get Covid! Get vaccine probably get super sick. Get vaccine keep mask still spread it! Oh need 3rd vaccine already waning! 

What done get go claim know anything! don't!  anti vaxers sign declaration trust medical profession threat herbs tierry bidet speeches. delta variant changed things, didn’t it? bung extremist far right politicians riling people attack system.  vaxxed Covid death elderly high-risk? Yes, see point, real data matches going show 3-4 times benefit vaccination. better nothing, think justifies vaccine mandate. see point vaccine mandates unless least conditions met: 80-90% efficacy long term boosters, safety, protection dangerous pathogen. covid vaccine meets partially. already looking like vaccine 50% less effective within two years use. flu also deadly mandate vaccine. schools dont close people overwhelm hospitals cause others die absorbing resources.  think need antivirals like new ones. 

But also think it’s likely 3-4 shot series first place. got cocky first two. Immunology knowledge. Also Israel measures booster efficacy starting 12 days-- 7 days immune response + 3-5 day incubation period symptoms. people threw heavy fireworks sorts objects towards police, went hand hand well, whilst ignoring clear warnings warning shots even. 

That safe protest, blatant violence. coming them. think 50/50, suspect we'll offered annual boosters along flu regardless. Sterilizing immunity respiratory diseases really hard, even small boost make tremendous difference seasonal surges, vaccines *really* cheap tend give positive health impacts even never exposed disease they're targeting. Flu vaccines even effective, still save tens thousands lives year.  could right, I'm skeptical side though. vaccine efficacy seems wane quick pointed countries already seeing 3-4x increased benefit vaccination. better nothing, sure try extra therapies like monoclonal antibodies. Supposedly even higher efficacy vaccine, even variants. sure would though vaccine produces similar antibodies. Possible body enough antibodies months. got 9th booster Racaniello certainly 'pro', TWiV regulars guests, mostly seem agree him. HOWEVER, sticks rigidly virology fails see wood trees - ago transmissibility Delta, failure recognise high case levels result reduced immunity \*infection\* (no matter great vaccines severe illness death) knock-on effect - small percentage severely ill dead gets proportionately larger, course. he's correct (the data boosters clear yet) wrong there's harm prophylactically rolling boosters see populations (especially vulnerable ones) wave infection, especially winter. worried; get booster. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Ridiculous. Sadly could go pages problems American medicine. countries. countries problems, terrible ones destroyed soul American health care. People trust doctors way trust Entergy Comcast, reasons. Dude talking about. fully vaccinated free person, need wear mask required keep distance, otherwise free unless vaccinated. background public health communication, specifically health communication, wholeheartedly agree. messaging AWFUL. tell people “don’t wear masks don’t work” try backtrack say “actually masks super important” bad idea. lifted mask mandates area, never stopped wearing mask. Many things opened area I’m still avoiding - crowded indoor spaces? thank you. Hell, crowded OUTDOOR spaces, thank you. 

I can’t say I’m surprised though. grad school studied CDC messaging influenza affects college students, one big reason people don’t get (besides believing give u flu - common belief) heard messaging flu vaccines need prioritized elderly felt selfish getting one. Public health messaging awful based enough research human psychology/message processing. Shorter version: work. thing might work, particular thing work. way, tennis player?   Good point! think it’s 50/50 booster magic bullet it’s pretty much given needing boosters forever. feelings mental health issues meaningless vs. lives people actually know care about.

You understand everyone would also say you? Pretty much. there’s real evidence thus far vaccine isn’t enough otherwise hampering immune responses. 

I agree pathways— it’s couple decades since studied detail— I’m skeptical vaccines aren’t sufficient.  Caffeine dehydrates bit. Make sure get plenty water electrolytes. vaccine presented us 94% effective PREVENTING Covid. switched preventing hospitalization due Covid.  Yep. flies really like lay eggs meat, particular meat located. antivaxxer movement started UK. Thinking uniquely American problem silly.  Oh yeah? tiny minority, majority would vaccinated we’d herd immunity already.   don't, US, national health system. civilized countries data.   Walgreens app would let schedule 3rd shot.

It’s important people understand this, I’ve seen frequently misused anti vaxxers say “look vaccinated people hospital, vaccine doesn’t work” bullshit. thing worries moving life long term symptoms Covid. I've yet see much data vaccine affects (or affect) outcome symptoms.

Europe CDC obesity problem. likely police shooting felt lives danger. Remember, Netherland talking about, police trigger happy. look footage riot, ton violence going on. Ah, makes sense. Thanks clarifying. told that?  Brazil People autoimmune disease immunocompromised first line vaccination. 

The highest risk people still high risk 2-dose vaccination though, low-risk people need get third dose. either, live avoid it. wanna get sick, dont give shit virus return favor. cells B cells produce neutralizing antibodies together. trying cleanly select one type cell/immunity need look whole. 

The article didn’t say N proteins don’t matter all. They’re terribly indicative immunity per se. expanding hospital capacity.

Sure. build factories produce healthcare workers? Seems like easy solution...

Reading stupid comments like 2 years crap reaaly explains failed response miserably. 1/50,000 risk under-30 men Israel data, dropped sharply 30. concerned get smaller Pfizer dose; there's need young people large doses anyway. Two countries attempted given up. I'm absolutely places requiring vaccines entry.

But I'm genuinely curious enforced Bourbon street?

The bars lining street sorta indoor/outdoor people sorta flow big group. There's dozens people going in/out one time. Anyone know manage? Unfortunately soon pandemic under-vaccinated. mechanism way describe rate.

We seeing vaccinated people still getting sick far less often, lower average vital load. know transmission vaccinated people need lower. know much lower. lied to. listened wanted hear. “Pros”  positie note: Flanders vacination rate 90%.   I’ve heard tastes like nothing… goal post ever moved? Perhaps 100 procent vaccination then
A short 14 days strickt lockdown might effective?
So spread stopped lockdown and
The low number left stopped wall vaccinated people. ELI5: repeated interactions maleria ebola anything it? Like strengthen immune system? Whar nation? Belgium 75%. Dude sarcasm sensor today lol. kinda agree this, feel ICU wards cap unvaccinated Covid patients 50% ICU capacity. It’s really fair max system choice. Funny watching Dope Sick I'm appalled sides opioid crisis, given clear position propaganda short terminally ill cancer patients, everyone else lay bed screaming. 

The CDC **knew**, drug policy experts pain medicine experts told them, proposed guidelines would result massive wave overdose deaths inappropriately targeted patients legitimate medical need intractable pain, made provision treat addiction users.

They deliberately enacted policy forced everyone much, much deadlier street drugs, overdoses soared. Pain related suicides people severe pain denied relief also become problem.

Of course, Dope Sick ignores nuance, well dramatically overstates often people become addicted.

That production reasonableness antivaxxers.  literally asked purposes lockdowns was. 

If said ""the health system overwhelmed country"" would agree comment chain would over.

However that's ""The always been"" many countries absolutely attempted eradicate COVID19 within borders pandemic, used logic restrictions. realise citizens EU countries get together decide refuse patent dont you? real people suffering, bunch politicians.   Right?? don’t agree protesters all, WTF. allowed protest safely, even views stupid.  “Every vaccine must thoroughly tested approved FDA made available public. reason production process particularly slow given strain, strain included World Health Organization’s “Outright denying”

Per comment, don’t that. simply declare triage policy. 

Keep mind, many public healthcare already “outright deny” certain services might otherwise covered private insurance. 

With standard, it’s difficult extend limitations treatment voluntarily unvaccinated and/or declare deprioritized triage.

“Not fair shove responsibility… healthcare workers”

By standard, it’s fair foist responsibility onto business owners either. already case wherever policies instituted. 

Healthcare workers already duty triage cases demand exceeds supply. natural continue duty face new triage policy. Katherine Wu phd immunologist would listen. 

I’m drastically opposed measures long spread really high, high enough vaccination nationally globally brought heel. 

If governments little less inclined toward letting dummies run rampant maybe would better. 

And again: triple vaccination big deal. don’t get people caught that. childhood vaccines 3-4. don’t even blink that. makes unusual?  inaccurate. yearly modifications flu vaccine use abridged process FDA said similar system applied modifications variants. *mechanism* vaccinated people. Asymptotic spread always part it. nose spread vector getting eliminated vaccine. overwhelmed health system? whole reason went lockdown?  want spread it, mask distance.

That can't last forever, across entire globe. vaccines end it, never ending. learn live it. Sterilizing immunity myth anyway: article shooting strawman version perfect ever lasting sterilising immunity. That's needed achieve population immunity. smallpox vaccine wasn’t sterilizing; still helped us eradicate pathogen.

Same measles diseases generally absent occasionally reintroduced cause small outbreaks among unvaccinated die out.

But covid seems require high levels triple vaccination achieve, possible. even everyone cooperates it'll take months people decidedly cooperating. 

Meanwhile covid still disease given free rein third population plus whatever probability breakthrough reinfection.

So measures... per article.  cousin minor car accident 24 lifetime lottery. 30 years later alcoholic/drug addict estranged kids &amp; family really win... point vaccinations widely available 1st world nations. wish get vaccinated want roll dice risk it.. it’s them. point can’t continue move goal post road. needs definitive end point/goal line. Shut downs might work every single person cooperated economies weren’t run debt. world economy built shutdowns mind know history growing portion population doesn’t want play along “asks”. shutdowns worth (at point pandemic) society fell apart potentially leads governments failing? say no. Thanks. I’m happy vasectomy too. Vaccines never designed end it, lessen severity. want spread it, mask distance. Yup, still. Everyone whine want virus doesnt give single fuck dont feel like it.   point COVID19 endemic world wide. 

You're going eradicate it. Vaccines widely available effective (but perfect course).

So restrictions point long term? going eradicate COVID19 soon loosen restrictions, cases creep back in. Things like closures, limits gatherings, etc. provide immunity COVID19 like vaccines do. tools used *delay* cases endemic virus, provide immunity future.

Adding restrictions hoping keep restrictions long enough COVID19 goes away globally seems incredibly far fetched. tunnel vision nonsense. path forward vaccines, infections therapeutics. new drugs mean serious disease infection largely thing past countries correctly deploy them. anything vaccination rate become less less relevant time. people who’ve never worked biological research lab: lots drugs show weak efficacy vitro (in cell culture dishes), rarely efficacy actual patients. ""Yes, doc gave prescription...""

Pharmacist wrinkles forehead hands knife. ""Three times weekly."" licensed doesn’t make real IMO. Real doctors don’t sell label online. would vaccinating children make significant difference? 

Restrictions long health system can't handle it. Literally whole reason started. isn’t good. That’s pretty shitty Outright denying people medical aid lot serious infringement medical ethics vaccination mandate. can't send people severely ill away. fair shove responsibility shooing unvaccinated people away healthcare workers, people enough already. Better prevent situation happening altogether protecting willfully unvaccinated (and that, protecting society unvaccinated) mandate. efforts effective reduced hospitalisations deaths? Unless would've really liked see far exponential growth go. us adults waited authorized. turned could waited weeks, time clue going get butts open wider population. entire argument FDA CDC playing social scientist without actual social science could see back position. would less confusing stuck question whether third dose safe effective left communication someone expertise area. Ditto questions rationing distribution limited supplies, US globally. excellent news. surge, caused Unvaccinated people, want lockdown? Low average life expectancy usually means infant mortality high. elderly still there.

I'd suggest look median age instead. Africans tend younger average compared developed nations. Given longer people likely ICU also likely vaccinated, 40% represents massive underrepresentation vaccinated people ICU. I'm area, would mean 2% population represent 60% ICU cases, representation factor 30x.

So fact vaccinated people tend end ICU translate information well transmission works vaccinated people? Maybe country? US, federal government legal authority simply mandate everyone get vaccine. best make required certain occupations activities. higher. covid (very, mild symptoms) back january. sense smell came back normal february. phizer vaccine late April everything smells tastes like gasoline. 

it’s depressing. Humans stupid. think smart connected information, yet dont know it.
We discover something get control let it. worries Vaccinate people let rain, vaccinate kids soon antivirals coming. It’s never going away might well get used it. suggest? Endless restrictions, masking lockdowns rest lives ? want live like ? T-cells produce antibody N proteins. same, linked. gather, N protein antibodies important, link posted says matter all. sure source trust. impression topic need research study. think main reason - enough vaccines. masks - first said - needed could get medicine workers.

Even now, cooking meat kind gross. followed guidelines/ lockdowns strictly weeks last year eligible gotten vaxxed maybe pandemic could stopped controllable level could tracked via contact tracing contained

No, true.

COVID19 endemic, global disease.

Everyone thread probably get (whether asymptomatic symptomatic) point lives.

What vaccinated brings death/complications levels low.

In lieu something like continuous tracking cell phones government, there's way contact tracing reliably done. 

I think many reddit would mandatory, continuous tracking population. Without that, there's major gaps sort contact tracing attempt. think people literally prefer dying suggestion. Ask doctor pharmacist would want gap infection shot, 30-90 days something problem early closing times. definitely think unvaxxed denied access. agree that. issue still mandating early closures venues allowing fully vaccinated. countries 40+% vaccinated people ICUs. need genius figure transmission vaccinated people still going fast. Protesting lockdowns dumb shooting protesters worse. Sincere question... flu shot? seems 6 month total  study take account mutated virus? study may applicable original alpha variant. 

How come linked study disagrees one ""They identified cells respond SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid"" ""Their studies showed individuals still lasting memory cells today, 17 years outbreak. memory cells, acquired response SARS-CoV-1, also recognized parts SARS-CoV-2."" Although clear response measured SARS cells.

Also, clear link ""neutralizing antibodies"" means prove this? agree. vaccinating people people need vaccinated. can’t open close society healthcare system strain, ok beginning, fixed problem. Hey man fault ignored decade epidemiologists saying matter time happened always been? Rate mutation seems markedly less non immune compromised persons They're forcing businesses allow fully vaccinated still close 8 pm. That's I'm getting at. means bar access unvaccinated much possible. forcing businesses shut early already accessible fully vaxxed completely counter productive.  mean apart literal years would take even everyone lived utopia started tomorrow? call “inverted snobbery.” boils trashing knowledgeable whilst believing superiority willfully ignorant. think depends lot personal living situation also. 69 live 94-year-old mother New Jersey, densely-populated state. wear N95 mask grocery story KN95 stores (because comfortable feel risk lower), see reason change point. hard chance getting Covid something want mitigate much reasonably possible. They're going ask date birth. lie age. No. court case gone way every one fools would've interaction doctor.

doc here. support this. found HCWs good commanders, leaders. Unable think themselves, human component vetted out. WHO: please keep ventilating masking vaccination

USA, EU: Herp-derp    don’t know vaccine worry keeping people hospitals

The flu vaccine. Literally annual vaccine since 40s. son issues taste smell. Mine came back months changed . longer like use fav foods  Spoken like childless American European. everyone opportunity you’ve had. natural immunity now? means highly unlikely get COVID near future. one time. Please get vaccinated can. reservations, read comments get vaccinated. sakes ours. Yes. truly sad. hope one day wake regained it. could call pharmacy double check. ACIP FDA stupidly trying play politics worried doses used boosters would taken rest world. reality job is, ""based clinical data vaccine XYZ beneficial outcome ABC age groups."" That's it. 

And remember Biden (the correct) half CDC wanted boosters everyone back September!! two top CDC directors quit month want boosters barred public service ever again. many people get sick played politics instead science?

Edit: btw US already purchased booster doses ship country moot point! You’re wrong, please consider context here. comment chain people wasting away inability eat due covid complications. Health risks associated overweight topic, don’t add anything conversation hand. person responding pointing people get carried away thinking overweight health factor - comment chain replying included people saying things like “this could better diet” “not drinking soda better anyway” people literally unable meet daily caloric needs - isn’t necessarily saying it’s factor general. 

You correct either overweight underweight affect someone’s overall health. However, conversation focusing one two issues, isn’t really need bring overweight also problem people talking suffering malnutrition. That’s they’re saying. called triage happens time hospitals. I've brought often. Pfizer's Merck's pill, believe last fall winter covid major issue. countries approve pills (hopefully emergency use) things start look much better. No, they're restating claim describing comments applicable it. seriously expect defend claim make? Well, fair, anything shuts host theoretically shut virus, barring unfortunate postmortem vectors. see whole lot ""believers"" chugging things like gasoline, though. someone secondary POTS thanks born it, can't help laugh this. Maybe POTS hot topic people actually look cures past beta blockers.

Probably though. poor souls doomed. know, live Netherlands.

Anyways that's good 3rd dose. Hopefully keep safe. lucky. Netherlands stick pay price now.

Again, makes sense. First, like Netherlands ""stick"" - cases went naturally wave burned susceptible population. Second, scientific reason ""stick it"" avoid winter surge. mean anything. Plenty countries summer surges winter surges (sometimes multiple ones).

Plus, Spain also massive surge went fast, situation quiet. sure implying arguing vaccines ineffective then? 

I'm arguing 16% population received booster yesterday (not even two weeks ago) nowhere near enough keep wave down, shown countries well UK. Plus cases flat even boosters that's anyway. case vaccine would compulsory, way better mask… yes don’t like also put much faith something people don’t know use. right, 95% recover chronic OD; that's number recover acute OD. I'll edit post correct that. explains downvotes.

As yet, nobody actually knows many people recover longer-term OD caused knowledge, study long-term COVID-19 olfactory dysfunction (OD) measured long-term recovery beyond 6 months.

So establishing numbers people risk, established level risk itself. could takes three months covid-19 OD heal. could almost nobody recovers.

One thing's sure: losing sense smell taste life-altering event. Nobody underestimate disability causes. human lives. could much ahead waning immunity wave.   Yes, I'm surprised about. would pretty frustrated stay home 3 shots, like taking measures country authorized boosters 30 years taken 5 months second dose. trust experts, I'm curious place short interval 5 months well, data seen said places.  epidemiologists also believe relying vaccines alone enough. Gupta says even attempt find way live Covid-19 UK, still restrictions place limit spread virus reduce number opportunities gets case numbers high moment it’s much better prevent new infections,” says Gupta. “In words, shouldn’t wandering around crowded places, buildings without masks on, even though it’s hard do. look variants we’ve had, emerged countries high, uncontrolled transmission – India, UK, Brazil. There’s reason haven’t heard Singaporean South Korean philosophy many colleagues agree with. “You want limit number opportunities virus gets roll dice,” says Hanage. “With natural selection, you’re basically talking creative force know comes solving problems. It’s amazing. you’d never bet it. expect virus keep evolving.”

This reason allow cases go high UK done since summer. back 40,000 plus cases day. give upvote   California big though several distinct areas. Iirc there's Republicans Wyoming. several anti mask areas adjacent larger cities stronger mask policies. places mix like South Coast Plaza OC ends 50% mask use. Thanks this. much easier cheer pain abstract watch person. People watching people suffering dying literally monsters want help them, whatever may done.

We're literally talking football stadiums. Try keep up. point article Supreme Court backed vaccine mandates. It’s Netherlands.

People right leary, especially hospitals filled fully vaccinated. Same. Im optimistic person read lot history taken psych soc classes, get people make bad choices. I’m realistic. guess optimism really got best start this. 

I said close friend “People going come together right thing. Trump going step right thing.” 

She pessimistic. said “Why think that’s going happen?”

I said, “Because to. alternative hundreds thousands Americans dying preventable illness. bad things US, don’t believe bad would let happen.” 

I’m med student never dreamed would see virus politicized. don’t think ever feel way society. Unvaxxed people get COVID take hospital beds go patients illnesses.

They're smart anyone, also misled, scheme authoritarianism--familial, religious, political--that prevents constructive application intelligence ways consistent liberal society (in classic sense). Instead, use defend invidious values indoctrinated, advantage vicious elites. removed vaccinated patients. limit beds unvaccinated. die waiting room. 80% total population fully vaccinated.

As doctor learned early job help need. judge cause. 

Be better. Ok, means people want it. mean possible. guys want thing stay heros want stay here. (even though heros likely vaccinated) 

That's thing think  Definitely report them. ACOG officially states OB patients Ireland adult vaccination rate 93%, though.  took daughter swimming lessons yesterday, one two exceptions, nearly every adult waiting area wearing mask packed. It’s completely voluntary, mask mandate place. What's insane money making whole time. salary eating executive bonuses profits, making hospital impossible run.

(For most, sure), don’t think force public measures something like long covid. hospitals aren’t getting full that’s end game.    mandate would certainly honest measures push unvaccinated get shot.
Having said number people could bothered get vaccinated. bit like visiting dentist hurts. thought caught virus. think it’s knee-jerk reaction downvote spending past 1.5 years hearing people downplay deaths “well, underlying condition”. can’t speak others, someone chronic health conditions, it’s felt pretty dehumanizing. Wow. I'm Sorry hear delay. reluctant get vaccinated stories like help confirm made right decision. realize cascading impact unvaccinated ppl had. Also talk germany Austria 2 less vaccinated western Europe countries. Also numbers getting higher last weeks novax assholes protesting everywhere. vaxxed, mask everywhere go, cases go (at least Italy). stupidity like 30 novax old people flew Sardinia Medjugorje come back positive, spreading virus north island. Also IFR 3X higher first wave compared second one idea treat it. vaccines IFR decreased lot more. people may look deaths compared infections first waves assume must lot infections based deaths that's case.  This. it.

When rights unvaccinated infringe upon rights others, consequences.

For example: choose unvaccinated, fine. end hospital, fine. pay full bill hospital stay. coverage. 

(Note: live Canada healthcare free) someone living 23% population double jabbed, every adult rich countries getting booster neccesity (and donating enough poor countries), doomed good? Yeah... provider cancer center. pandemic broken me. deaths, although course heartbreaking. people refuse bare minimum prevent pain, suffering, trauma, death. patient day nurse rural hospital. sick respiratory symptoms advised get covid test. refused inconvenient quarantine.

There sides  So, saying trust poor countries vaccinate population gonna give chance. get point tho, ideal world vaccination program little centralized getting control currently have. way world ""uniformly"" vaccinated Yes multiple variables anti-vaxxers far biggest issue currently. politicians cowards side 90% vaccinated precious 10% lunatics trend strongly right/far right fear losing votes. Austria Western democratic country declared mandatory vaccination face new lockdown. truth: 10%+ people incompetent morons need ordered right thing.  keep believing buddy hospital clinic allowing unvaccinated workers present huge liability. people vaccinated matter Covid cases raising, barely get symptoms. Portugal getting 2k cases day barely anyone ICU couple deaths.

Right makes sense say different flu, least here. Everything pits. wish put this.

You sound capable quite clever. got faith you, stranger. sending vaccines countries though. That’s first part issue. vaccine first came quite people getting doses weren’t groups knew someone said “we like 10 extra doses, come get shot”. That’s what’s happening now. It’s use lose it. sending vaccines countries doesn’t guarantee able effectively administer doses go bad   Meanwhile, holidays coming, people travelling, football stadiums filled.

Welp weird system needs change. We're rewarding people building dangerous areas. Think need run soon think insane people reddit little emotion. agree. Don’t want get vaccinated? Fine, sign piece paper says get medical priority get covid. February 2020 stocking advance telling coworkers prepare work home. got called Chicken Little. Guess what? sky falling whole department still works home. 9/11 gave us “enemy” fight , that’s beginning messaging could framed war enemy (the virus) patriotic join together war blah blah wasn’t theory behind notion “kids don’t get sick adults Covid” bandied last year. Logically makes sense, guess. clash ideologies insane, I'm telling you. actually need clash. Even worse, guy thinks he's one good ones.. 


I care whether anyone gets vaccinated not, lot respect someone stands ground get shots, whatever reason deem valid, someone spreads aversion towards unvaccinated inhuman manner. angry they're taking beds, they're still people. Might well go around blaming HIV patients worn condom. So, two doses still better vaccinated all. priority, would send vaccines countries low single dose rates healthcare workers older people gotten hands vaccine, instead giving boosters younger people rich countries. all, called booster dose program ""scandal"".  live US. testified state's legislative hearing mandate vaccines students public schools. why. plan get booster day turn 18 too. nurse friend wants Longitudinal studies taking vax...

I'm like.. leading physicians WORLD read current studies got vax.. Longitudinal studies people got first measle vaccine? think surely agree matter Longitudinal studies require years time. pandemic, still; novel virus extremely contagious, killed millions, &amp; rapidly mutates. less able transmit different host (human) less ability mutate, right? either guinea pig fighting virus without vaccine one already proven satisfaction world's leading scientists &amp; doctors. Either way we're guinea pigs. 460 million vaccine shots given US 3 trusted vaccines. time constraint have, testing would make feel comfortable? feel like pool data together, literally largest vaccine study ever. 

Here's current look numbers:
Current analysis puts unvaccinated around 12+x likely hospitalized &amp; Average around 20x likely (multiple sources).

""The protective effect vaccination noticeable among younger groups. September, risk COVID-19 death **23 times** higher unvaccinated people 30s 55 times higher unvaccinated people 40s.
...Then, looking longer time period -- Jan. 15 Oct. 1 -- researchers found **unvaccinated people 45 times likely contract COVID-19** fully vaccinated people.""

Here's advice: ask local doctor trust life. math says he's already vaccinated,ask him/her why.

Hardly first time done. It’s already terrible Michigan 25% positivity rates hospitals full.  great movie staring Denzel Washington called John Q. feel getting level now.  \*Some\* obese people spend time effort 'fix' it, \*some\* (I'm obese, agree, hard beat; smoked lot, thankfully trouble leaving it.). question is, draw line? deserves treatment?

I like ER, particular, triaged sick are, notion 'deserving' ... ton history screwing try define deserves treatment.

If like obesity example ... DUI driver? 

BTW, I'm vaccinated boosted, family. I'm arguing unvaccinated people dumb, I'm saying price dumb get hospital, regardless much angers you. need make crime unvaccinated. I've spent week Mexico, still everyone wearing masks ect. people seen wear masks white tourists.  Triage ignorant morons  No. That’s good visualization poor comparison. Smoking far better. kills 1300 day US estimates, similar age distribution covid. There’s good way avoid chances dying smoking like covid. willfully choose dangerous option, yes you’re going cause potential damage others mostly you’re stupidly risking yourself. Eh, say eradicate Covid? ""How (portion America) handled COVID19 better (America)""  vast majority America believes vaccines masks.

If triple vaxed, masks offer 5 10 % boost overall immunity most. Hang stay well. :( discouraging many Americans ignorant far along, it? get booster?  approximately 5% G&amp;A beds occupied covid patients. 26% ICU beds covid patients. I'd willing bet significant portion 5% 26% ""fit, healthy, younger people"". supposed doctor wants complain misinformation spreading got booster Friday work, along general flu shot. (Original doses Pfizer, booster Moderna) laid yesterday LOL Yay science. I'm mid 30's got original doses last spring work school district. I'm one one aide, always knew would get booster benefit kid(s) work with. 

And yes, miss information sucks!     I'm Nola working hurricane, 1 place (Walmart) enforced it. Oh airport  HIV neck woods Ohio. Percentage vaccinated surrounding counties, mid 30's low 40s. pathetic.  Fauci hoping 10k new cases across US per day. 3 daily cases per 100k population.

CDC threshold 50 weekly cases per 100k pop mask recommendation including vaccinated people. 7.14 daily cases per 100k. 

These numbers bigger pre vaccine goals 1 case per 100k population supposed help us low/no community transmission contact tracing help eliminate virus. 

Sadly Covid season cases flat/rising might get Feb March. see big waves every winter.

Not local outbreaks.
There sterile immunity respiratory viruses.


The main difference much strain hospital's due COVID new immune system anymore promising treatment options. main difference see Puerto Ricans care neighbors strangers much family. took care communities much different way areas mainland experiencing hurricane devastation, could lot culture.  “The freedom choose” = selfish individual doesn’t care infect / kill anyone else. 

It’s great countries like Australia, Canada, etc taking sensible stances. hopefully male governments / citizens take notice recognize isn’t politically motivated all. well. county never seems stop surges, co workers mostly get vaxxed. afford gap. Watching closely see find durability time third shot. far looks hopeful. Good article, thanks sharing. Again, cases matter anything headlines. Hospitals deaths do. Good  numbers Europe particularly concerning making stronger argument seasonality. 2.5 9/11s week agree, making joke. vaccines working. Yes 10 players/coaches tested positive they're experiencing mild symptoms overly sick. Compare last season Canucks outbreak 25 infections several quite sick.    Indeed. downside make thing completely bad. politics policy, end justifies means. kind nuanced assessment apply useful, much labor-intensive, binary judgments conditioned make, ""like dislike."" don’t see point vaccine mandates unless least conditions met: 80-90% efficacy long term boosters,

If isn’t arbitrary condition ever. Btw may indeed turn two doses longer interval offer 80-90% efficacy infection that’s durable. Plenty vaccines don’t get years long efficacy without boosters… that’s immune systems work. Otherwise you’d never get infected anything. probably already knew making shit because… feelings.  large population poorly educated frustrated young men number one key ingredient starting revolution, war…or soccer riot.    willing kill thousands people attempt power grab,  low stoop.  hate Djoker he’s dick. antivax par course him. That’s main reason people dislike him.  Real hero Patience Saints well people ,but they're human . love visualization used. really drives home impact this.  Less likely still spreading genius . look Gibraltar, Israel Singapore . Use logic instead believing mainstream media Wait till Thanksgiving.

Frankly - I’d describe extreme end experience. too. :)  Insurance needs deny coverage. pay treat unvaccinated? like socialism anyway pay themselves.   absolutely convinced point commenters don't. anyone heard recent updates vaccines 2-5 yr olds? Last heard (at ACIP meeting 5-11 yr olds) would likely first quarter 2022.

Edit: fixing dates point need refuse unvaccinated gates. chose abandon civilized society, denied benefits. paper vaccine passport, don’t think so. electronic one, there’s app called CovPassCheck Germany supposed used places business. I’ve ever seen used. Whenever used app-based certificate, no-one actually validated authenticity even checked identity. 90% Ireland vaccinated. course hospitalized population higher percentage vaccinated people. 

If US higher vaccination rate, percentages vaccinated unvaccinated people hospitalized would equal like Ireland’s. Aw bless optimistic heart.

We're already screwed. peer reviewed paper.  Vaccines: okay

Boob implants: perfectly fine

Statement: want put foreign things body.

This line logic brought Florida. literally said friends post full hospitals course anti-vaxer comes says sorry kid it’s actually flu ask hospital can’t handle flu. Ummmm honey it’s flu never happened hospitals canceled pediatric cancer appointments.  That's going happen. know that. numbers right extremely bad.  know additional boosters needed. Tons vaccines, including routine childhood stuff got babies, three- four-dose series *the way immune system works.* anything, it’s weird unexpected two doses close together expect lasting immunity come that. Primary vs secondary immune response.

Also - ask good faith - *what* price getting society back getting covid shot every fall along flu shots? see Ireland near 90% vaccination rate among eligible population. Meaning majority hospital COVID admissions vaccinated. That’s statistics work. However, fact almost half people admitted unvaccinated despite high vaccine rate tell something. Meaning unvaccinated absolutely eating hospital space. Drop him, worth it.  See discussion regarding many reasons crap: actually attached plastic poo emoji centre hub desk fan work Velcro returned office January 2020 traditional winter hibernation period. Honestly I’d scared anti-vax community scary times dangerous don’t need child brunt nasty jokes hatred. hospital really release statement saying babies cancer getting appointments canceled. think whole hospital code whoever worse gets priority treatment keep happening unvaccinated stop getting sick?!? Praise God doesn’t need chemo last year even canceling kids haven’t heard happening yet!!! happened back beginning without vaccine! even started moving adults children’s hospital. husbands siblings won’t even get vaccinated niece think anti-vax group far gone unless someone married lives dies covid.    ever since pandemic started conspiracy theories appeared vaccine would ask question: wait pandic create vaccine control people's lives, reproduction, freedom not. use something everyone uses without second thought like aspirin? Advil? million counter drungs buy take? realize people refusing vaccine also didn’t follow mask/social distancing guidelines went entire pandemic nothing wrong becomes easier see they’re refusing vaccine now. “back normal” nothing changed pandemic didn’t affect don’t see reason anything get either.

Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Someone ship posting daily updates unfolded. remember following beginning March 2020, shocking everyone ship tested positive despite extreme quarantine previous weeks. I'm confused. one side there's news mostly unvaccinated getting infected, news ""IMMUNITY WANNING, EVERYONE NEEDS BOOSTER, PANDEMIC NEVER OVER"". correct? That's dudes point.

I'm vaccinated boosted. wife. 6 year old first andy 14 month old far behind.

There waiting Covid Zero go back normalish life. debate what's acceptable.

Frankly, hate fucking case metric. Let's focus hospitalizations death. could give two fucks unvaccinated. decisions made based impacting fully vaccinated people, say, near pre vaccinations. I’m ER nurse Canada got booster yesterday. remember almost crying getting first shot January scientific achievement was. can’t even comprehend looking evidence getting it. that’s true, would seem pretty shocking. Unfortunately much tied commercial secrecy often hard know truth saw Covid back feb 2020, knew would become total sh\*tshow would stay, humanity sucks  guy article, apparently 9 months prepared hip replacement postponed indefinitely 3 days occur due hospital needing beds unvaccinated. ripple effects life humongous.

 I'm farmer. next months quite time, could take time off. Next spring I'll either recovering surgery still waiting, unable move around. Early spring early summer busiest time year. Effectively whole season shot. planned cortisone shots year could get things buttoned land. Knowing able carry firewood stove stacked enough inside make new year. mounted winter tires truck wife could use commute next weeks recovered. chains plow hooked tractor could clear way snowy part year able now.

The insurance deductable we'd strategized meet happening that's bills next year. wife's cancelled interviews new employer qualifying insurance take time.

I continue physical agony hip replacement. financial agony putting food dinner table (not figuratively, mean growing it) real. Hiring farm hand, someone plow, I'm even sure I'll able take dog outside day, real. 

As farmer whole ""social isolation"" thing done much lifestyle. I've left property slightly less often virus. I've worn mask decent thing do. I've done civic duty. got shots independent tell know interdependent world. area relatively low case numbers pandemic. test positives hospitalized highest ever been.

I know end post. I'm bitter angry sad scared. physical pain go away eventually, might farm, views human condition alarm most. Never underestimate well-endowed ignorance. gonna say tf patience left point?  Spot on. They're happy tell us come terms higher death rate (at least loved ones impacted) absolutely refuse come accept *their* behaviour might change too. 

Pure selfishness. Remember anti-mask rallies early people intentionally coughing spitting prove wasn’t pandemic going on? don’t remember Contagion either. wonder happened people… delta, mostly elderly comorbidities. delta, it’s coin toss.  Sorry, folks almost entire year triage Vaccine. others suffer selfishness? examples thread people getting sun standard case due covid others. needs many weigh needs selfish few.  Irish vaccination rate 18s 92%: vaccination rate anyone 12 89%: can't get 12s stats even 50% 12s took vaccine (low estimate) stats show Irish population HIGHLY HIGHLY vaccinated yet virus continues spread like wildfire since easing restrictions VACCINATED people: Irish population close 90% vaccination rate government mandates stop small unvaccinated population going cinemas, restaraunts, pubs etc use COVID certificates: even counting people natural immunity caught virus recovered!!

Any logical person must therefore conclude vaccinated people less risk death hospitalisation still SPREAD virus high rate unvaccinated cannot demonised sole spreaders virus anymore.

Any opinion clearly politicaly motivated based reality evidence.

Unfortunately population 100% vaccination rate virus would still spreading without measures/treatments. current vaccines silver bullet stop virus although help. medical work needs done. question mark headline dead giveaway answer “probably not”.   That's personal outcome. Like, makes happy see others suffer. Society, whole, better important philosophies underpin entire industry thrown out. personal retribution. Frankly, acceptable now. risk vaccinated boosted around death severe case extremely small. 

My hesitation 5, there's 1,000 deaths 12 whole pandemic. wish could throw away US citizenship move Spain. Ah guess nation people unable read titles articles. understand vaccines work? it’s always been. WTF. think eradicated horrible diseases past? always requirements. difference conspiracies misinformation proliferated net rubes eating up. nothing do

This exactly true. know fact high level antibodies 95% infection. we're seeing 50% speed bump Delta. question whether maintain high enough infection population. know anyone answer right now. really still eats. avoids foods used love. documentary gave nightmares. workers trapped ship countries try help them.  Pfizer booster knocked flat couple days, nothing compared even flu years ago. Sure body aches, fever, chills, nausea fun, would heartbeat. hesitation whatsoever need another booster next spring. Gonna fail both. coming “glass probably half full” type person LOL Colorado checking in. wish mask mandate! One way look basically vaccinated. go day maskless worry free. ignorant uneducated get vaccinated die covid zero sympathy. exactly! better eat case. every try talking loud enough heard crowd people? true case numerous viruses, SARS-CoV-2 vast majority person-to-person infections occur hospitalization carriers still interacting others. way infected individual succumbs Covid. 
Becoming deadly mutation would impact virus' ability stay circulation significant way, evolutionary perspective matter whether disease kills 1 10% hosts. charge insurance upfront cover higher risk unvaccinated. could like smoking cigarettes sense. required receive vaccination Covid test admitted hospital Covid. Assuming isn’t medically contraindicated. want Covid treatment you’ll get covid treatment. ethically can't really this, think looking strained resources, willfully unvaccinated need lowest priority. turn treat someone else coming treatment (heart attack, car accident, cancer, whatever).  increasing annually. overweight normal definition since vast majority overweight. We're less 7% away obesity majority people becoming norm. reversing this, trying convince antivaxx get vaccinated. vast majority people absolutely desire tackle something feel real problem (or **their** problem). True, rinderpest 2018’ish recall. Smallpox still remains human virome thus far. Viruses largest biological planet. It’s sort mind boggling really, 10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 estimated. family members bewildered thought problem vaccines came would people fighting get first.  Really? Two years pandemic still use idiotic argument completely beside point?    It’s better societal outcome one selfish person removed society Send different hospital (however far away), like gunshot victim can’t get bed cause covid patients Wait, dumb? less likely cause symptoms equally likely cause hospitalization/death?   needs lot discussion this, especially comes ending mandates transportation airports/flying. can’t endless, need way out. Looks like Austria strong influence,

and maybe death.   People still using horse dewormer argument?  Politics. absolutely right, Netherlands started boosters too, taking much time. people without vaccine pose much larger risk hospitalization. Well read single thing said. asked verification donkey brains, please provide that?  Oh agree that. felt like say things absolute certainty fact nobody knows Efficient shutting disease, sure. Thats China. 

Bro fully vaccinated, whole family vaxxed, 80% close friends. time understand someone get shot respect decision. body. 

Villainizing unvaccinated bad happening world regarding crisis counterproductive leads conflict divide. 

Stop aggressive stop justifying rudeness fact somebody disagrees you. unnecessary.  No. Death outcome much like Recovery is. Symptoms symptoms path outcome mean principle, yes matters, pointed injustice greed happening. reason donate, something I'd want know/look more. Yeah, thought would wait months vaccine demand would high. I'm sad old immunocompromised people. sucks rational people live states low vaxx rates. I'm sad latest big victim pool, [unvaccinated chance, doubled stupid. I'm fully vaxxed &amp; boosted, wife same, older son 2 shots, younger son first... life less back normal, although kids wearing masks school, wear mask grocery store, etc. would support mandatory vaccines Americans, doubt happen anytime soon, option left? Watch idiots kill themselves, get life. breakdowns see 10% vaccinated. Depending lot age, chances dying COVID case go couple percent like 1 1000 vaxed. I'm using less chemicals using old fashioned remedies, products MLM pushing ridiculous. Many caused damage people property(fridges, counters, furniture, etc) many MLM companies middle one lawsuit another. 

The bossbabes huns increased pandemic. MLMs predators are, taking advantage people work promise large income. reality, average annual income less 1,000/year. plan. province live largely following plan - things (still) great here. since July. Nothing like Europe (yet, crosses fingers).

Everything open. Well, open enough.

Except lifted final capacity restrictions certain types venues. ( They're limited like 50% capacity restaurants bars. )

Everyone still wears masks stores.

Desk jockeys work home.

I can't find indoor soccer game play - capacity limits kids first line (as appropriate, us men get desperate go play outdoors wold - like made Mexican national team Edmonton last weekend.

The problem ZERO restrictions - like Netherlands presume - somehow Netherlands managed see saw ""full lockdown"" ""wild west open"".

The problem full full opening zero restrictions kind - even 20% population unimmunized - overwhelm hospitals 3-6 months straight. Certain American states chosen path.

Anyone chooses path - 300% 500% deaths rest let's really really clear this. country choosing between:

* ""figure get orce citizens vaccinated act bit differently""
* 1700 additional deaths per million people (above right now).

So everything happening Netherlands right (population 17.5 million) - arguing letting 30,000 people die not. holy shit fuck Hold stick them, else let's get dying with. What's point hand wringing? scientists don’t run theory? Same. remember first year pandemic, collective hope ""we hold vaccine!""

At time, even considering we'd many people declining pandemic would continue spread. comparison getting potentially life threatening illness suck live life you’re feeling bummed seeing peoples faces? Traffic fatalities suicides roughly 100 people per day US. considered public health problems tragic numbers.  tenth COVID numbers, each.  deadly symptoms appear Good you. MIL wavering getting second Shingrix shot. saw experience shingles, scheduled second shot week, lol. pure misery. Feels long ago.. covid first hit news like couple weeks Oh asked another poster weight loss. hope maintain healthy weight. I'm fully vaccinated got breakthrough case covid unvaccinated child despite careful. long covid let tell you, loss smell/taste least worries. days lungs feel wet full mucus feels like I'm getting enough air. there's days I'm fatigued hard things. right remain vigilant sucks much there's end cure. healthy barely leave house work struggle. death symptom? Fewer symptoms mean less death. restrictions sustainable long-term? Yea. specifically put choice among us would want vax’d cannot due health issues. in-vax’d selfish a-holes. deaths already higher 2021. accurate even scenarios.

People seem think virus recovery works like zenkai boost Dragon Ball. doesn't. lost weight? feel like lot people would snack less taste good taste all. Happened recently. Went ER 3 times unrelenting stomach pain. First night went told constipated gave laxative morphine get out. Second time, basically thing. Third time finally CT scan pain unbearable. Turns tumor cancer last year. Still waiting bloodwork confirm, ER bunch COVIDidiots go 3 times got proper diagnosis. Dave Blake's take last days basically been, ""will COVID EVENTUALLY become endemic? Yes. important know data delta have, average country taken 4-5 months peak cases reach low transmission levels. Obviously, high number triple vaxed people also helps get low transmission. US endemic either February March."" old high school friend posted FB yesterday cure smallpox, that’s apparently next pandemic Govt. releasing? replies batshit crazy. There’s typical colloidal silver, also MMS (diluted bleach) something called TRS spray? bunch “natural” remedies like pine needle tea weird shit make pitcher plant. God, hope so. K. Sorry.  soon say.

The phase 3 trial 5-11 gave vaccine 3000 kids detect cases.  

However, rate post-vaccination myocarditis somewhere around one case 5,000 10,000 vaccinations teen boys (and much lower girls); conservatively assume risk 5-11 boys, trial's small confident seeing any.  reasons think risk likely lower (due 1/3 dose) that's hope optimism science.

In couple months (well May) much better data. Hoping healthcare professionals working field chime change perspective. 

I reading article doctor's patience wearing thin unvaccinated landing ICU many healthcare professionals complaining enough beds turning away need it. So...why turn away unvaccinated got sick make beds got vaccinated need medical attention? Let unvaccinated stay home use whatever homemade remedies researched online treat pain. know sounds heartless say this, healthcare professionals power choose gets ICU beds they're consciously choosing save unvaccinated simultaneously complaining insufficient ICU beds treat vulnerable patients. ""it's flu bro"" narrative always annoying many reasons, one flu actually pretty dangerous virus. I've seen plenty patients ICU due flu, even young healthy people. kill tens thousands people US average year. ""Just flu"" shitty argument flu fucking sucks, flu kills people, want flu spread 365 days year. Considering contagious deadlier flu, people shut up. person clue happened WSOP Sure, feel better 6 year old eligible waiting second dose, still concerned 2 year old.

Less issue 2 year old isnt school, also lessoning/vanishing restrictions, concern grown part. love anti-vaxxers immediately pivot *the obese*. ridiculous reaction. 10 months solid protection would fine covid ever settles season. I'll gladly get shot year, like flu. would hope eventually enough people either gotten immunized caught virus enough least smattering protection. 

I think that's ideal case point. Another annoying respiratory virus deadly certain populations, manage responsible. FWIW mayor-elect NYC said last week wants end school mask mandates spring, kids option getting vaccinated. governor Kathy Hochul made similar statement last week. NY Times published article yesterday top experts saying February March masks become fully optional. guessing unless massive winter surge new variant looking late winter/early spring masks go away.  makes life miserable come across smells about. smell slowly recovering (12 months post Covid). First issues apple juice dairy products chemical taste/smell, like someone cleaned containers cleanser. eventually corrected one stuck around long time coffee smelling like dead skunk (they literally smell) made grocery shopping miserable everytime went past coffee beans, seems correcting incorrect smell going go eat fun.  That's point triage. removes morals equation look survivability post-recovery quality life objective standpoint. Triage kind thing - last resort. survive, long-haulers, organ damage complications, could accurate. Hell gamble though.  mandatory. respect choice. called democracy. nothing pay taxes.    sorting allocation treatment patients especially battle disaster victims according system priorities designed maximize number survivors

Sounds like would give care certain people deny care others maximize survival, means would DENY CARE certain people. yes correct, triage normally happens ER, however pandemic far normal point. additional articles updates triage COVID. short Google search. Maybe calling someone insane. lmao 😂😂😂


Why downvotes though?
Unless son doctor/virologist see he'd lose sleep it. everybody like let specialists stuff best we'd shit long time ago. feel dumb. thought vaccine would couple months.   believed be?

This woman Master's degree Columbia, sister law (me) epidemiologist, works germ central, yet antivaxxer. frustrating. people probably know 3x likely become hospitalized COVID overweight obese, though. statistics publically available could use reminders, given seriously many take pandemic. Furthermore, childhood obesity risen past couple years, start another public campaign like one Michelle Obama did? needed ever! Right, but... 

Going 160 km/h highway send anyone ER. Going 160 km/h highway also mean requirement medical resources treat ""selfish"".

Following logic, say driver danger ""divide people"". Even believe likely harm others twists facts make appear behavior safe. 

It's matter probabilities. vaccinated, much, much bigger chance spreading virus sending others ER. opinion, well documented countless places world. Unless live alone wood never go society, refusal get vaccinated makes bigger statistical risk others. either unempahtic misinformed choice divided society, people pointing facts. It’s strain everywhere else. people (even old and/or immunocompromised people) hardly get sick think it’s allergies, others die.

It’s always way, part makes covid challenge. Everyone knows someone mild case, people write die health issues (even do!). rinderpest (in cattle)! We're also pretty close polio, fight guinea worm progressing.

But think right, covid probably going endemic.   vaccinated, covid much bigger risk common cold, par influenza.  still agree that, part, vaccinated people “live lives.”

That said, unvaccinated people “doing want” still problem. ICUs overcrowded throughout Midwest, leads *thousands* additional deaths people covid. 1100, many vaccinated? I’m boosted everything still going crowded places I’m weakling. Breakthrough cases scare have, years. It’s like people don’t know it’s less healthy overweight.  Getting back premise article, think timing terrible. Boosters first became available shortly useful duration roll-out mRNAs administered highest risk groups. Institutionalized elderly. one two month period allowing people get first boosters open others.

For part, people tools available maximize personal safety. far, biggest failing pandemic response failure promptly optimally use tools, whether incompetence institutions, commonly poor decision making millions individuals.

All really wait go like Russian flu used low transmission rates community spread reasons trending know what’s going happen holidays. We’ve seen 2-3 times now. postulate Lee’s outlawing masks day getting struck caused enough influential people complain masks finally gave up. Really frustrating. beginning plan would happen spread X case count Y. things happened threw play book mostly whatever people screamed while. really proud sticking mask mandate face national attention (or maybe national attention) least kids first shots e path much immunity possibly have. Probably high vaccinatio rate higher + previous infections (0.52% population died covid) city reached herd   studies kids extremely robust quite old. Vaccines don’t magical delayed side effects. usually see side effects immediately soon after. expecting side effects occur? year? 5 years? 100 years? asinine people treating this. side effect would expect would ADE, we’ve seen ZERO that. 

Yes, understand want measure protein. trying actually argue? 

FYI many childhood vaccines became mandatory within years less released. wasn’t nearly politicized 60s since GOP hadn’t infected brain worms. Maybe vaccines herd immunity almost reached, city 0.52% population died  big problem still even saying vaccine data preliminary. know pandemic changes things, saw bad idea draw conclusions preliminary data. 

I really get it, either; first year, message consistent masks would last thing go, best easiest precaution. made sense, plenty room authorities ""the free market"" make masking normal comfortable. everyone (on every side) kept talking masks big burden, looked excuse get rid them. Sure, would still anti-maskers, suspect certain percentage would come around comfortable masks people became used them.

It used walk mile, reason, people around would say ""oh man, sucks! That's long walk; must tired!"" got around new crowd people would say ""that's bad; that's nice walk,"" made think things differently, started getting lot exercise without even trying. Masks could same.  overwhelmed places 1% population currently corona. pressures system lot care that's postponed. basically admitted point useless well, essentially throwing stones whilst living glass house happened? I’m OOTL Hi American Rotterdam here. mild here. America we've never properly dealt pandemic government's role individual's part. could easily get thing control worked together vaccines, masking, social distancing, sadly never happen. There's many agendas much misinformation floating around get hands deck US gov't seem interested anything anymore. vaccines rolled attitude ""you're own"" that's enough. End rant.   Heres video refering day comment below. Interview ICU doctor Uwe Janssens, former president DIVI, interview german sure point trying make. They're welcome check hospital want, can't force doctors prescribe something want to.  risks shots virtually 0.

This proven yet. given enough doses. countries putting hold that, says enough reason cautious. vaccinate kids less severe illnesses

Because vaccines decent track record safety, rushed through. probably took 10-15 years made mandatory. words antibodies nucleocapsid proteins matter.

Because they've done immune tests reactivity, found N protein displayed high. COVID-19 patients presented specific immune response full length fragments N protein and, lesser extent, fragment containing amino acids 300-685 protein.""

Could something, mean anything. can't find source, someone twitter saying UK released report somewhat leading conclusion. wife 3rd dose. Kids 3 weeks fully vaxed. waning immunity thing good going get us right now.

Yet end sight restrictions.     Tbh , reading EU refused patent free vaccines African nations, deserve everything that's happening them.  think side intolerance whch something else allergie think. Allium intolerance seems even rare seems.  depends underlying vaccination rate. 100% population vaccinated 100% admissions. 50 % vaccination rate less 5% admissions vaccinated vaccination confers 90% protection serious disease. 
This simple maths adequately explained reporting. Proof vaccination great! worthwhile even ask proof negative test? Unless quarantine testing showing proof, good it?  partner vaccinated we're still taking precautions protect kids."" kids vaccinated, pandemic ""over"" US

What moronic way think it. pandemic always collective issue protecting health service. Nearly everyone, certainly children, low risk. Everyone suffer approach. Didn’t pass muster court Facebook adults living New York City officially eligible receive coronavirus booster shots, following decisions made Friday federal regulators expand eligibility shots across country beyond underlying conditions, live work high-risk settings 65.

The decisions Food Drug Administration Centers Disease Control Prevention brought federal guidance line New York City officials already started interpret it. City leaders advised health providers Monday turn away adults seeking booster shot, provided enough time passed since first vaccinated.

A spokesman Mayor Bill de Blasio said Friday 732,000 adults received booster shots far New York City.

“Let’s get number lot more, particularly we’re getting ready colder months,” Mr. de Blasio said week. “That’s fight back Covid colder months, that’s get ready something wonderful: holidays.” ""doctors"" prescribe medicine take home? whole purpose show control real valid reason sideshow? Wait, I’m getting medal Allium genus plants onions, garlic, chives, leeks etc. part Things look for, immediately several hours eating breath I’ve read, seems like pretty much medical reason get vaccinated severe allergy ingredients vaccine itself. seems like medical conditions, vaccine less risky covid pretty universally recommended.

I’m sure outliers, appears I’ve read last number months.    Trump cocksucker  got vaccinated early held accountable staying top booster timing. say that’s unvaccinated? Dense. 

The unvaccinated blame continued spread cases vaccinated. Period. choose get vaccinated, yes, choosing risk potentially fatal respiratory illness. husband stupid argument God knows what, removed living room playing phone mulling things over, 2/2020. 
I never ever forget look husband’s face came room said “ watching news scared. need go Costco now”.
Before get upset, bought 1,one,uno everything use-1. saw people walking heart stopping.  moment thought people worst could get- idea anti maskers anti vaxxers right behind them.  Yeah lots people get still vulnerable get again, especially Delta. Best bet get vaccines provide far higher protection. That's dark justified. imagine ""well well well consequences actions"" repeating head.  nothing like smoking, nobody chooses get covid. Strange way say 3%    Employers requiring vaccination step towards this. Private insurance (especially) definitely changing.     sister held getting vaccinated didn’t want deal side effects. reminded catching Covid would last hell lot longer day two. Then, wanted quickly “one done”she chose J&amp;J vaccine. caused far side effects anyone know had.

Thank making right thing sharing experience. helps people make decision it. Stay healthy, Happy (American) Thanksgiving! would perfectly ok hospital letting critically ill unvaccinated person die could get hip replacement.  Ok?    One thing pandemic shined light many people apparently completely incapable holding one idea head time. Virtually every argument trying anything solve problem hinges reducing one point ignoring point. 

The whole reason pandemic first place aggregate several qualities coronavirus; ease transmission, average length infection, average severity infection, rate asymptomatic spread, rate hospitalization death rate. intensified real treatment options initially unusual cases elevate risks long-term damage across variety internal organs. 

It's things make situation is. people arguing vaccines masks social distancing ever pick one point go ""well 100% perfect obviously can't anything!"" 

It's crazy, like said, two years we're still hearing crap people fundamentally even understand problem.  Sort bimodal distribution. Weird, guess it’s possible get - course even [a fitting xkcd However point whether live die (though much hope lives) - whether long term damage it. know mother (my coworker) does. (my coworker) got COVID-19 year ago still recovered smell, struggling brain fog several long covid issues. knowing daughter might terrible ride (with PIMS extra treat...) anything nice. salary eating executive bonuses profits

I hope case. worry hospitals lay staff try cut corners expenses instead. Totally this. either vaccinate EVERYONE it’s rolling restrictions covid deaths next 3 years least. middle ground all. feel like need categorized prioritized. 5 ventilators left? Give 2, 2 left? get none. let nurses decide. “I’m working unvaccinated people” get whatever left. doctor nurse wits end quit anyway, rise high stink, demand work vaccinated people only, can’t end worse anyway.   Fauci says time running short really means time run out. 

It’s abundantly clear public what’s needed stop spread accord.   Even easier solution - vaccine mandate.  Nope    yep, went upper Michigan weeks ago funeral (non-covid related), person wearing mask outside airport. one distancing, restaurants bars full like everyone pretending pandemic exist. winter started earnest, everyone's hanging indoors. *shrugs* feel badly already burnt medical personnel, winter gonna suck. give two shits anybody else dude. 2 weeks full protection  got booster!  fun. many severe cases are. 

Also easy sounds it’s obviously covid. presenting massive heart attacks, strokes, unresponsiveness, seizures, full blown cardiac arrest. Hard attribute covid get evaluated.   whole point National Guard public service? People enlist Army need job (no longer ""calling"" service), National Guard sorts things needed. imagine benefits fully enlisted soldier. red taking debt? Selling assets? know this? claims require scrutiny. Also, fair point loss procedure revenue, supports point. Even profit centers badly damaged wages/overtime 1.5x more, ship still sails.    would think something affects entire globe like wouldn’t fall “routine” category. Everyone deserves utmost transparency this. bit weird cant really blame downvoters anymore honest. Everyone tired people want over. Noone wants read bad news.

For reason mostly stopped discussing pandemic giving opinion news surrounding it. Except positive. people laughed asked Covid vaccine 5 minutes later I’m giving flu, tdap shingles shots  I'm sorry deal this. feel like news failed us country. Stories like need told, everyone needs understand wearing mask getting vaccinated important. I'm tired selfishness people can't bothered either two things.    Yes, I'm keeping track germany, QR code, will, scanned, tell scanner vaccination status, name day birth. 
So, first glance pretty safe dont give anyone access ""vaccine registry"". information QR code. 

Since nearly impossible fake codes, atleast 2 ways get valid qr code matching ID. 
\#1 fake little yellow vaccine record book, change cover whatever, visit pharmacy create QRcode. 
\#2 corrupt people working official place, create qr codes. likely telegram people, really hope lot scammers groups.   

You also dont need app. enough print QR code, maybe laminate it, good low battery. 

I think time stop accepting little yellow books stop allowing pharmacies create QR codes. everyone enough time get code. 

But regulations vaccine mandates bring people buy fakes. much easier get fake wait least 5 weeks fully vaccinated. 
With latest law, also got hefty fines jailtime.

Right problems, revoking QRcodes. since last year anyway ... lets see good/long booster shots do. antivax people keep paying 200€/year.   Normally people willingly endanger people's lives put jail. I'd imagine vaccine mandates acceptable freedom restriction even freedom loving country. You’re spreading lies would absolutely get people killed anyone dim enough listen you. thoughts that? exactly people underlying issues need protect. Oh yeah. boss straight mocked last February got nasty. one day suddenly office freaked tf pregnant wife getting sick still home. feel like Covid demonstrative showing, like oozing pustules bleeding every orifice people would losing shit vaccinations. That’s really difference.  I’m sorry, heartbreaking. Coming family farmers, imagine would feel.  Smart folks saying pointing emphatically India back mask burning party, called mentally ill ignored everyone could pretend 2019 weeks should, hope will.  Absent systemic infection, think one way Covid critters get upper bowel. people know anti vaccine also anti cancer treatment. still drive cars, go “natural doctors.”   Got boosted yesterday morning. side effects. fatigued first 2 shots spring. Moderna three. Good luck boosters. Anecdotal got shots April, got boosted September, take absolutely precautions gotten COVID. got shot around time, took precautions, didnt get boosted gotten breakthroughs.

TEXAS courtroom even! true severely ill Covid patients generally suffering Cytokine storm point actually Covid present bodies? 

If Covid present can't imagine argument using Ivermectin, even think great antiviral.

Are common life threatening Covid conditions Cytokine storm main cause? people able nervous skeptical vaccine truly know long term effects are? What? People talked potential vaccines since Feb 2020. Yes. goalpost always level hospitalisations. Literally majority article explains 80-90 percent vaccination rate good enough we'll need rates comprehensive measles polio vaccines unvaccinated stop spreading filling hospitals.  


It's pattern again. Epidemiological experts say ""hey guys, need even vaccinated get past pandemic"" reporters either dumb lying turn ""vaccines enough/don't work/aren't magic bullet"" story.  pills promising, especially combination vaccines, we'll wait see impact. entirely possible pill cause fewer people get vaccinated, take time make difference. think would two weeks, thought going turn nothing media fear-frenzy problem would dealt U.S. without much fuss, like Ebola, SARS, even Y2K mania. certainly learned lot diseases feel lot less naive human nature now.   Lol, okay sure. vaccines don’t prevent infection mask wearing almost nonexistent outside handful cities states, don’t know you’d think worst winter.

Probably get worse holidays Agreed boomers also eligible soon enough. CDC made people 65 eligible September 26, 2021. many seniors initially vaxed early winter space seven eight months more, considerably longer Israel began boosting five months. longer six-month interval CDC eventually recommended. Many people including seniors got around lying. do--that's posted, still see ""two weeks"" thing everywhere, nothing.  get it. let everything back normal.

People would take vaccine want die. Unless legitimate medical reason cannot get vaccine, hospitals obligated provide care unvaccinated individuals. exceptions religious beliefs. exceptions communities distrust medical professionals. Pray gods favorite talking heads salvation.  easy solution. Unvaccinated get Covid? back line - behind perfectly healthy kid runny nose brought overly concerned parent.

I'm sure makes medical triage decisions, choice obvious. Covid going away, large share population never get vaccinated. let's start planning world new normal. Well, live NJ nobody gives fuck.   fair, everyone coerced didnt support govt supported terrorists. fact links reputable journals meets wall silent downvotes illustrates silly become.

That’s false. see people taking precautions every day. live NYC rules. Chicago  probably move Florida become cop there. Much higher, far... exactly difference first two shots booster? booster first second shot? booster it’s unique shot? countries, get cold, self-swab using one get result 15-30 minutes

these nationally available counter, subsidized government (and be, IMO) don’t disagree course pandemic changes.. it’s dynamic. listened virologists said “we’re going need boosters annually” well delta variant. opinion analysis paralysis levels government. would willing bet folks top level knew boosters would required reason don’t want make call communicate people set expectations. failed. messaging could been, we’re eventually going need boosters.. don’t, surprise! It’s better underpromise deliver.     New Zealand would like word...   feel dumb. thought vaccine would couple months.

It would everyone got vaccine states started opening back up. soon vaccine rolled half country like ""yay back normal"" skipped critical step actually getting vaccinated. guess thought everyone else would to.  discharged Friday still vomiting almost passing (incidentally, reaction third shot day before). literally barely stable discharged me.  go media similar this? I’m genuinely thinking way hospitals going better media shames it. awful sounds, cute kid cancer denied treatment due cletus MRI machine might it. remember earlier year said MASKS (if you’re vaccinated), remember happened that? Hundreds thousands people died.

Very ones died we're vaccinated though. I've got vaccine jabs getting booster. personally believe vaccine harmless particularly affective, better nothing. Ireland 1 highest fully vaccinated, cases continue climb we'll need booster. roughly 50/50 vaccinated unvaccinated ICU. figure misleading morons pointing vaccines work all, case ratio closer 80/20 not.  doubt  Wow absolutely sucks   Yup. son two those. He's 10, first dose. chose outright lie get booster (mistake). brought home school passed on. 

I'm frustrated people can't easy thing protect others. urgent care worker understand frustration. seen family 2 years. However, family (small is) successfully ate Thanksgiving dinner last year NYC without infection. quarantined correctly, tested thoroughly, followed rules. there. (Florida).
Granted, family higher IQ thorough understanding scientific methods. 

I relish another year alone. do, will. next spike tragic. 

Get vaccinated. 2x, 3x. it. forget flu pneumonia shots, either. I, too, also dabble public health (ok binged episodes Podcast Kill You). explain SOCO? Well it’s hospitals planned smoking deaths natural load. hospital toll (right now), although obviously pre vax covid really potential overwhelm system Holy shit, I’m conservative bigoted Australia 76% fully vaccinated twelve years old, one four eight states/territories rate 92% first dose.

Unfortunately, change anytime soon unless culture society changes.

Good luck stay healthy. Nah. I'm part unvaccinated Western USA. I'd starve took position event business 2 minutes conclusion. We've barely hit 50% 1st shots. best tell fence friends &amp; colleagues get vaccinated take agree. telling everyone first second Pfizer trials subtly telling gotten sick yet zero health issues post vaccination.  think people actually make ""inside box"" decisions. Given ""ivory tower"" academics exist in, focused data ignorant what's going around them.    Seriously?! registered Republicans California total people Wyoming, Vermont, Alaska, North Dakota, South Dakota Delaware combined many registered party preference. read article? author specifically touches this. practically ran house get booster day authorized doctor's ""yeah sure want"" blessing (due high blood pressure absolutely brought extreme stress sending kids school mitigation measures).

3 weeks later, everyone house got COVID except me. vaccinated (not boosted) husband really started worry bit wound getting antibody treatment. I'd never seen 5 year old daughter sick keep waking check pulse ox. 

It sucked taking care everyone, would completely fucked one it.  last year, I'm convinced anymore. Probably, I'm sure there'd still idiots take it. lot done. seems country actually thought measures want spend money (I suspect latter). government programs promoting weight loss CDC's publically-available statistics say THREE times likely hospitalized COVID overweight obese!!

You seem answered question. vaccinated unaffected? anything, keeping unvaccinated away means tables restaurants seats movie theaters vaccinated.

You make sound like vaccinated angry new restrictions really means benefit it. Yes, mom different reasons said like eating greasy saw dust cement. lose fun stuff, eating becomes like taking gross medication orally large doses.

So depressing. ""different reports"" different ways looking numbers. People misunderstand interpret % reports, especially places high vaccination rates. Put simply:

* Say population 100,000 people 90% vaccinated.
* say population 1000 COVID cases hospital.
* 100 people vaccinated 900 unvaccinated, would equate clickbait headline **""10% hospitalisations vaccinated""**
* - importantly - also means that, **of vaccinated people, 0.1% end hospital** (100/90,000). Whereas 9% unvaccinated people end hospital (900/10,000). 
* example, unvaccinated 90 times likely end hospital vaccinated are.

Make sense? don’t want inflame anyone happens “follow science”, it’s cdc following data careful politically correct. 
Im scientist hate “follow science” statement, science it’s usually black white anyone academia knows arguments experts field completely normal… consensus.  country actually **plan** get rid it? also incredibly stupid *still* problem. 

Even vaccinate *everyone* get R 1. certain point may enough. Like Ireland 93% adults vaccinated, yet may facing increased restrictions whole.

What's goal restrictions? Best reporting system Got second shot may. Smell coming back already. Besides fatigue symptom. get booster :( Outdoors tribe proper testing tracking reporting even deaths Netherlands imposed partial lockdown impacts businesses already accessible fully vaccinated.  Partial lockdown means get go you’re vaccinated. can’t go you’re not.

I don’t see translates imposing lockdowns vaccinated.

You really confusing Austria’s new measures Netherlands doing. absolutely thing. solution what? Canceling society interactions? Again? Almost two years this, it’s becoming normal matter much face politicians want sabe restrictions. Also 85%. Firing live rounds protest pretty big fucking deal. suggest? one gets people (plural) saw Costco stopped pulled mask send text message. *A text message.* left mask around chin put phone away. data phase 3 trial. people able get boosters January. That’s know hold way 10 mo this. Israel started using boosters late summer believe. yet, virologist believe distancing masking measures might wiped Yamagata strain flu. 

Humans could anything want, cant organize. Contact tracing delta… that’s inconsistent statement there. can’t contact trace virus r 8.   baffles me, highly vaccinated country use restrictions? need ramp situation, it’s becoming maddening even us everything (vaccinations following guidelines). think lot backlash coming frustration  don’t see mention forcing fully vaccinated people back lockdowns article, restricting access unvaccinated. Yeah got mine 2 weeks ago. I'd heard boosters approved didnt realize specific people. called local health clinic asked scheduled appt spot.

Glad got spent 4 days group friends road trip turns one Covid whole time. week Covid me! Nope. antibodies primarily target protein coronaviruses, particular S1 subunit RBD contained within S1 subunit, preventing viral entry host cell. Authors recent study conducted University Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center concluded serological testing using S1 protein including RBD needed identify individuals neutralizing antibodies. Researchers warned serology tests confirmed presence antibodies N protein, may mislead people falsely believe potential immunity re-infection. SARS-CoV-2, heterogeneous IgG response S1-RBD N proteins responses always correlate other. study, patients antibodies N protein S1-RBD, failed exhibit neutralizing antibodies. Additionally, neutralizing capacity higher patients antibodies S1-RBD compared N protein (86% versus 74%). Furthermore, rate healthy individuals positive antibodies N protein higher compared S1-RBD (3% versus 1%). Overall, indicates antibodies N protein portrays prior exposure SARS-CoV-2 related viruses, necessarily indicator presence neutralizing antibodies.” weird different per person, never lost even  There's foolproof mechanism so. Pres. Biden's mandate employers 100+ employees held 5th US Circuit Court Yeah, Biden tried DJT-appointed hack judges tossed them. Mandates ain't gonna happen.

We rely people (and businesses) right thing. we've seen, even tiniest inconvenience enough send people raging lunatics... so, ain't gonna happen either.

The best protect ourselves.  Heh, that's something might actually access possibly means couple things, mean anything all. 1) vaccine effective natural immunity 2) could something happening vaccination disables bodies ability produce important antibody Nobody right mind wants lockdowns forever.

One group sees today’s lockdowns temporary pain get us pandemic.

The group bunch short-sighted toddlers couldn’t see past nose. Right, know. understand given circumstances things can't proceed quicker obviously know anything process.  OK, tell words think means.   govt going lockdown businesses pay bills. Financial hardship much propellant pandemic mutating virus. comment made another subreddit regarding issue:

The misconceptions vaccines stems fact originally conferred strong protective immunity original Alpha variant. Delta came along tremendously increased virulence combined passage time causing natural antibody attrition, vaccinated much likely test positive symptomatic vs things year ago.

From early studies boosters appear bring level protective immunity back considerably, though course simply isn’t 100%.

This nuance neither well communicated well understood general public it’s reason we’re seeing much confusion surprise people test positive.

Of course, thankfully, protection severe illness remained much higher level infection resistance. However even I’m reading fully vaxxed unboosted individuals (mainly higher age brackets) unfortunately suffering uptick progression severe COVID, they’re really pushing get people boosters.

There’s also misconception direction people acting like COVID vaccines never developed preventative immunity mind, isn’t accurate. it’s coming place helping remind people cautious continue practice COVID countermeasures regardless vaccination status (which right thing), it’s particularly problematic. hospital girlfriend works at, half nurses unvaccinated. similar situation are? know nation. one Reddit from. mean come people, still every time? Like get it, really do, know meant.

And yes, 75% nowhere near enough R value Delta, much obvious.  answer realistically ages approved months get vaccine serious illness becomes choice. Plus, March hopefully Pfizer drug readily available, combination treatment prevention miracle. It’s going away. We’re going back 2019. treatment vaccine needs boost every 6-9 months whatever good. someone comes unresponsive covid symptoms super low O2 saturation? designated covid beds full die? better societal outcome? get selfish assholes suck dragging pandemic on. can't upend medical philosophy triage. severe patients need seen right away. That's ER works.  Got second dose late April. got booster, got breakthrough case COVID. Wound hospital. I’ve never felt sick life. feel bitter. felt like everything right. Social distancing, masking, going except necessities, vaccinated. fiddle fucked around didn’t immediately get booster I’ll quarantining Thanksgiving. I’ve never sick life. hope vaccinated least gave small measure protection. person listened advisors Xi Jinping, told phone call would disappear spring. also die choking olive low transmission levels still driven almost entirely uninfected unvaccinated adults. epidemic anymore, that's sustainable endemic situation either. Mortality still high lower prevalence, eventually hosts run out. wondering unvaccinated patients admitted ICU comorbidities young healthy people?

Australians even allowed back country guy, fresh spreading covid Europe gall complain he's paid sit quarantine play matches.
You entire industries shut guy complaining take reasonable precautions inside country still getting paid massive amounts money.

Seriously, like rules stay home - want him. Say experimental jibby jabs Delta Variant different ideas.  It’s 3 weeks since Ocugen filed application FDA even start trial Covaxin US. This. honestly thought we'd pull together real crisis.

Seeing responded was... life changing. clarification: doc right. see, there's different reasons chemo, different chemos different reactions chemo (i.e. people). 

As know, white blood cell count low, might dangerous, vaccination might also pointless. 

I venting sometimes circumstances block golden paths hobble stoned treadways (did say right?) got, others (offered be) carried road prefer stand everyone's way. Check back month yet none lead health care system stretched extent others denied critical emergency care.

In theory, coronavirus, especially recently, experience fighting covid-19 - maybe that's part puzzle gets hit hard not. Sure.

I hate place. can’t indefinite restrictions though… end one way another, everyone wants vaccine time get one, might best do.  father icu atm... double vaccinated. Approx long booster antibody levels start rising? really seem like donkey brains, anything verifying not? Countries 90%+ still huge surges. anti vaxxers Gives whole new meaning calling someone “a waste oxygen”. 🤣🤣🤣🤣   Well, Spain started vaxxing people early January, wait June get first dose. vaxxed oldest first, together Healthcare personnel, gradually younger, got age group late June. definitely wait 6 months could get vaxxed.

The upside is, 95% people 60 vaxxed here. Also, 89% people 12 older vaxxed, pretty good. We're giving boosters 70, plans include people ages 60-69 next couple weeks.

I hope keep us getting ERs overwhelmed! Ivermectin may may work; 

Nonsense, almost good coin flip.  100%. Rolling boosters every 6 months viable long term strategy. slow mutations best way getting people vaccinated not. break cycle though? Cause otherwise we're trapped indefinitely planning lives around repeating covid waves.  paying attention seems. Take step back Djok asked January, get back talk.

Comparing things someone taking 5 minutes get vaccine routine Walmart visit absolute steaming pile bullshit. obesity could treated $100,000 vaccine, I'd borrow 100k tomorrow get shot. I'm even kidding, would fundraise, hustle, wait long lines, literally ANYTHING shot cured obesity. 

Smokers would gladly line get shot kill nicotine addiction. 

Basically, argument bullshit. Obese people spend millions every year tons time trying lose weight. Comparing someone bother get FREE vaccine Walmart ridiculous. Can't believe consider bad thing    ment way around, sorry. low R0 would die own, matter high R0 variant exists not. easy say ""there competition"", none explanations yet even try explain exactly competition supposed happen real world.

Don't get wrong, clear people infected variant also protected variants, increasing amount makes harder new variant take place, considering extremely low amount reinfections all, effect identical among variants (as long one escaping immune responses).

And vaccines (+recovered), e.g. alpha enough 50 percent population protected lower R0 1.0 Delta would need 80 percent, saying Alpha ""outcompeted"" feels wrong since vaccines killing Delta. Seriously. Imagine thinking like drunk drivers. ""They real victims, turn delicious cocktail? advertising! powerful. drive home, need truck work next day. They're human, can't mad plow family car kill everyone inside."" throwing people street someone comes splinter needs somewhere sit 15 mins. can't government both? US government pass infrastructure bill recently? government single person focus promoting vaccines telling people lose weight. mention always threat infectious diseases drug resistance. wish people would vaccinate much next person, right. obese smoking, choices. leading reasons hospitalization decades.  Living crayon eating stereotypeI see.  thanks. know deal much floor see time. Almost put confused patient restraints overnight kept removing monitors ethically force sitter live Covid room. lost another one overnight even husband visit Covid positive home, want die alone. Ripped fucking heart out. like dilemmas I've past months.

I'm tired grieving.   took father home hospital late, doctors already killed him. 


Please give money.   fairness, vaccination Smallpox still potential make someone ill. Smallpox vaccination really deliberatly infecting someone live Vaccinia virus, related pox virus, dangerous 21st century much safer cleaner Vaccinia samples. Vaccinia infections create cross immunity much dangerous Variola Major Variola Minor viruses cause Smallpox.

Smallpox vaccines often contaminated sometimes contamination due methods causing secondary infections like tetanus syphilis (and anti-vax people blamed illnesses vaccine itself).

But Smallpox nasty disease, people got vaccinated anyway. Well course, I'm saying misinformation potent 5 mins Facebook even somebody pro vax likely question things. also people dying boosters sooo many people sharing stories? ACA number minimum coverage requirements things like hospitalizations also bans charging aspect health status, one exception smoking. yeah totally... THEYRE OBESE think insurance companies eventually put stop that.  respiratory therapist know well.  tOoK hOrSe DeWoRmEr?! mYpIlLoW gUy SaId WoRkS  It’s weird. parents refusing medical treatments kids mad whatever vaccine… brought hospital sick because…??? don’t trust us come here? patients also wearing bit thin. That's totally accurate. hospital red travelers cost 3-5x staff nurses sustainable long term. cutting executive bonuses, cutting bottom line. complicating factor procedures operations big money makers hospital, always been. Covid ground halt multiple times due us locking elective procedures, due risk, primarily due bed shortages. literally can't room people many Covids floor. fucked up. beautiful hopeful thought was. miss days"
