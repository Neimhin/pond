0,2020-10-12," That's full study - they're going approval EUA basis 2020/21 data holds up. One thing noticed old enough friend groups went separate ways meet years later people influenced others ways even perceive.

I friend hated certain activities - hated them. Now, years later, they're social environment activities dominate. quick get-together reunion remember trying sell XYZ great was. mention remember years ago suggested complained much hated it.

People's subconscious tastes actually change based group preferences ""atmosphere"" community.

People really mental, fully convinced fake virus. mass delusion. looks like. We'll see winter brings. Cool we're saying people smart get mayor might festival cancelled year. ""The coronavirus infected 20 lawmakers 120 staffers pandemic. now, widespread testing plan thousands people work Capitol complex, despite bipartisan calls."" worst part people cite damage lockdowns realize widespread masks + social distance effective alternatives. What's wrong ridiculous clear average person? kind people believe governments would push COVID death numbers higher actually are. China, everyone knows government lies reduce numbers dead. government saying, 100 dead, everyone multiplied 10 masks went on. would government make look bad increasing death toll numbers purpose? ""To take mah freedom."" Fucking imbeciles. given propranolol. holtor monitor results showed nothing ordinary (he said often really fast didn‚Äôt think big deal) haven‚Äôt wanted anymore testing anything. fine can‚Äôt afford anyway. initial episode went ER, thinking sure going die. heart totally beat long getting confused dizzy couldn‚Äôt talk, gave oxygen took blood EKG tested found nothing cost almost $3000 unfortunately Try conceal family Vietnam knew Jan. failure you. made livestream. think? 
Took ton work, take more. ""Anything possible guess"" - current standard American journalism held to. 

""Can get Covid twice?"" one pressing questions world right now. deserve actual answers, research evidence. reporter instead chose publish unsubstantiated interview woman who's pimping GoFundMe. article garbage garbage sub upvoted without second thought. Can't see that? people used smart hell, engineer sun microsystems back day. It‚Äôs crazy see quickly lose sense reality reason. 

I know I‚Äôm guilty extreme struggle greatly humanity last 5 years. I‚Äôm getting comfortable sociopath, imagine convinced comfortable now. misinformation caused deaths. can‚Äôt separate two outside questionable mental gymnastics. Buy hey got rich essential workers risking health keep world functioning. like say ""the herd immunity folk"" like rest comment place directly camp. article said 75000 Americans died covid-19 article said may have.

Also, facts implicating died virus reality know actual cause. know deaths took place Covid. 

Pointing mean care people dying. That's weak form arguing.. Flu different case really different strain circulating every season. tons viruses remain time still reinfect Mild times, he‚Äôs early 20s. Wont matter long confirmation happens. that‚Äôs plan. wants destroy economy? Really. 

Politicians don't. Business people don't. Travellers don't. 

Nobody wants unless necessary. spreading facts people get delusional reason said ‚ÄúMayor X‚Äù, it‚Äôs recognized town putting Bonaroo title gets way clicks it‚Äôs something people actually heard random name random town. dad tried tell guy remodeling house said nephew told everyone covid like symptoms marked positive...

When told full shit, tried tell CDC requiring so, says website. Man idiot. MSM gradually waking reinfections, several months behind curve usual... Interesting. way, article shows authors actually understand log plot works. start 100th case avoid undue attention noisy essentially meaningless data 1-10 reported cases. old news. interpretation incorrect. I'm happy market instability caused misinformation lockdowns.

At point rejoicing death, simple reading comprehension determine that. wish fearmongering, corona. here! I‚Äôm Tennessean! Anecdotes good knowing possibility, probability. also record genetic data first test, think happens certain hospital settings. holter monitor too. arrhythmia inappropriately fast, especially going laying standing. need echo rule stuff next step ruling POTS, automatic nervous system disorder causes heart issues. POTS triggered viral infection. friend suuuuuper sick December-February thought lingering flu/cough. started shortly returning China. POTS issue one heart valves. beta blocker help symptoms. fevers sounds like COVID. Anything possible guess. Amazing, psychology disease. People around world specifically find reasons believe disease affects people different themselves, leave that. Weird think virus could affect could infect others. Yes..and Biden leads polls..üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ state legislature actually acted relatively quickly codifying Gov. Whitmer's orders unemployment. 

But Michigan's legislature controlled Republicans--so, naturally, they've taken opportunity tie continuation unemployment benefits wide-ranging liability exemptions in-state businesses corporations. words, they're forcing governor choose signing package unpopular provisions bear political heat burning nearly 1,000,000 Michiganders cannot afford wait months continued benefits.  Charles Darwin approves post.  keep seeing people saying they‚Äôre gonna return normal matter Spring/Summer/etc 2021, it‚Äôs like that‚Äôs gonna make go away, it‚Äôs gonna push thing mandates social distance guidelines extended late 2021 later act surprised experts predicting exact thing. might end majority GOP senate. January. Taiwan apparently know nothing about. I‚Äôve got plenty stake starlux shit bed back January Eva much better. Taiwanese airline survive stable way China air Can't assume lot re-infected getting tested they're displaying symptoms?

To meet absurd criteria reinfection test positive, test negative, test positive, also infections fully gene sequenced (rare) sequences different.

The extreme rarity two infections fully gene sequenced lead massive undercounting. know guy claims got covid 3 times lol public order prevent secobd wave? Government cant cure stupid. 100% going happen.  learned fuckall lack social distancing masks rose garden event caused outbreak.

It one thing GOP supporters ignoring public health measures top level members GOP.   fucking idiots hell bent causing constitutional crisis Ha! see there. :) Covid causes heart attacks strokes- attacks blood vessel system, patients end thousands clots bodies. It‚Äôs attacks kidneys, heart, etc, lungs. Got flu shot yesterday. wearing P100 respirator bright pink replaceable filter cartridges, nobody looked twice. yet still chose cropped version... No, think many states underreporting cases make case opening economy. kicking road. See, posts like interesting. Contracting COVID painted incredibly traumatic (I know be), especially older crowd. I'm going get kind ongoing ""long haul"" stuff. 80 year old get twice...that's confusing. times? wish America would listen one! thing properly reopened bars/restaurants. course possibilities.

That's said ""high chance"".

Now yountals UK... like week ago said UK underreporting cases. Then... UK admired 12k underreported day cases abruptly bet. goes really troublesome one: high chance France underreporting deaths. (Roughly 20 day last 2 weeks, would say something 200-300 up.to date).

Why? Long time Hopefully final season isn‚Äôt shitty. Yup, ""There way stop this"" comforting lie, COVID tough impossible control, far it.

You add Australia, Vietnam, South Korea list too. case? mean, virus going manageable part, sure much reinfection matters long run. Thanks Dr Bill Gates! Christmas December? Get joke explainer guy right now! impacting everyone directly *causing* deaths? would better news moratorium. Nobody would even known ""pandemic"" except gerontologists statisticians. numbers then? also running body bags hospital. CMS also pay bounty money recovered way happening large scale, would require many people keep mouths shut. ""reach"" Phase III.

Instead, shortcuts taken justify Phase III testing without Phase II results first obtained.

Were political bellyaching, would Phase III trials right now. could mad cute smile üòã Pontifex Maximus mask thyself look who's right now. Fuck no. wouldn‚Äôt know, maybe I‚Äôll find baptize posthumously. fucking weird. People Politics subreddit jaded view something like that. care science protocol, care letter comes name. There's one thing that's actually worse showing COVID denialism publicly, that's backhanded manner. Like know CDC protocol, politics like theirs, okay put pillory. *Happy*... hypoxia? dies??? Shhh! Sweden burned March. GOP death wish? need keep motorcycles nursing homes! Turns Americans fit. Mormons named angel Moroni anyway? CMS started paying 25 percent extra patients COVID related diagnosis starting March. 

Was coding, probably (there always is). 

But firmly ‚Äúdon‚Äôt fuck IRS level‚Äù bad ideas hospital admin. could even lose hospital could even lose ability bill Medicare additional fines jail.

CMS pay also whistleblowers part money recovered widespread conspiracy would hard get away with. also data algorithms watching suspicious billing. think that's herd immunity folk proposing though. They're saying allow young (under 45) live lives normal risk low (virtually zero) keep economy ticking along, alongside protect vulnerable, old sick isolation method.

Yes, that's keep ***saying***. easy say it. people charge keep saying simultaneously absolutely nothing key aspect plan, namely protect vulnerable, old sick isolation method.

Very little done attempt this, little has, like restrictions visitation nursing homes, rolled back plenty states.

Lots older Americans can't survive social security example, work part-time make ends meet. helped? unemployment benefits long gone, 70 year old worked Walmart greeter do?

What multi-generational homes? assistance those? allow younger occupants work, maybe instead grant elderly place stay apart them?

Same questions repeated risk groups.

Nothing done right now. keep saying they're protecting vulnerable, aren't. barely even tried to.

COVID basically allowed spread freely, widespread measure taken still place mandating masks, even implementation Surely better current system lives well-being almost everyone damaged destroyed?

Yeah, hypothetical system described, seriously attempted anywhere, indeed better alternatives. best system though, would system used differing success Germany, South Korea, New Zealand, Australia, Vietnam, etc... ""Get virus control"". probably late even try US that's tried. better even ""good paper"" idea, actually done successfully several countries. horrible situation, one clearly federal government stepped provided requisite funds treat, curtail spread horrible virus. Fuck giving inch politicians anything maximum possible save lives beat virus. means paying working people 3 months salary stay home, fucking it, cowards. course could this, people say can't bare see dime go pocket could've gone theirs. least raclette articles say vaccine ""automatically dangerous""?  done report potential risks vaccine people informed it.  almost media's function report news something. Yeah, mind-boggling.

I saw someone commenting Youtube China make Trump look bad.

So China cahoots make Trump look bad way let Trump keep insulting them? leaders fault

Do leaders? proof it, ie positive test, would've mentioned article. Actually seems like they're intentionally omitting information. really celebrating fact 80% 21 patients survived drug 17% 24 patients survived without?
This big enough sample say much anything worth looking further.
The press release comes across cry raise stock prices. well people asymptomatic therefore people's Innate immunity strong enough keep bay Hello citizen Earth! suggested Chyna strong amazing. trigger certain feelings people you-know-where.

So thought I'd poke head over. everyone today? tell friend‚Äôs experiences. I‚Äôm young, might early heart thing now. doctor 30 day holtor monitor didn‚Äôt find anything. But, know problem. heart beats extra hard fast situations it‚Äôs terrifying. I‚Äôve stopped drinking caffeine eating really sugary things that‚Äôs something triggers heart beat scarily fast. saddens think something might worry forevermore. source? find number officially released data.

I feeling got numbers clearly wrong puts last 3 days exactly number infected dead day.

While go official numbers Monday.

You see actually 2825 Monday‚Äôs results. data released Saturday Sunday yet.

This article trash, experiencing exponential growth right now? evidence suggest anywhere near exponential growth? Actually SD hospitals running space sending people state already tested months couple South-east Asian Latin American countries. hope see clinical trial results first. given reported, think probably safe enough take necessary. I've eaten vegetables year ever before. hope that's right move. idea getting awards here, zombie stuff sounds better 5g causes covid conspiracy entire fucking goddamn point pausing study determine vaccine caused not.

Most people would call ""science"". fans reason stopped Laker fan. realistically expect Moderna Pfizer vaccines approved around Thanksgiving? heard serious side effects yet. said isnt deadly seasonal flu. First provide survival rate percentages seasomal flu? tell many people actually get it? important many people die yearly? tell facts still completely miss point.

Bringing Ebola said enough. one decease deadly infectious decease less deadly way infectious latter one obviously way bigger treath know, ever feel unusually tiny warm spot heart reason whatsoever, I'm thinking quote this. aLaS nEeD StOp cOmPlAcEnT people dying can‚Äôt get health insurance pay treatments 
When people go bankrupt due medical bills pretty hard think everything great America. Quite possible intentionally jot test already knew positive. forget it. sub people decided Sweden herd immunity, facts important. Fucking hell love New Zealand Man covid real lethal fatality rate we'd fucked. Good thing precursor what's come next MERS.. RKI numbers cited far less JHU reports. JHU numbers proven correct end, updated quickly RKI numbers. Florida‚Äôs fuckin us  People calling people sheep sheep herd.

Most us. included read articles. headlines. Articles writen research. large chance reading personal bias reporter someone misinturpets information

And unless research. relying faith tbh. Faith told treuth.

So treuth likely somewhere middle.

Except flat earthers. guys hella dumb. Oh must new. Jesus fucking christ embarrassing. 

What point serving country decade? Wasted time sacrifice. mean fair hospitals paid treating covid related deaths. incentive lie, unlikely real impact death count accuracy.. since study even shows undercounting covid deaths significantly. say fake damn right harmful disrespectful covid patients, love ones, healthcare workers  25-year-old man known immune disorders underlying conditions infected Covid-19 two separate occasions, according study published Lancet Infectious Diseases ""It also strongly suggests individuals tested positive Sars-CoV-2 continue take serious precautions comes virus, including social distancing, wearing face masks, added research needed understand long immunity may last exposed virus, second infections, rare, present authors gave several explanations severity second infection, including patient encountering high dose virus reinfected. Tbf word hypoxia sometimes used describe hypoxemia.

For anyone know, hypoxia low oxygen tissue, hypoxemia low oxygen blood.  Slippery slope Perfect time beautiful new better health insurance promised! Oklahoma, ""hold virus""

  saying wear seven masks once?  Welcome sub new user.  Type 1 interferons no-show early immune response setting stage dysfunctional immune response. Indeed. Interpreting guidelines going immediate effect one thing, article also highlights medical ignorance actually implementing measures resulted implementing wrong measures too... really worried implication indeed - hundreds doctors medical professionals ""followed orders"". Obviously all, since IVO hundreds professionals also filing whistleblower complaints time, quite lot. registered nurses ignored management doctors attempts draw attention issue? assumption larger plan? temporary.

Just like new Zealand.. wish avg person understood this. I'm soo tired hearing ""Well wore mask distanced anyone still caught died. Therefore masks usueless."" üò£

The person wearing mask lowered risk yours!!! thanks killing enjoyed freedumbs!!! Man soo frustrating!! üò£ Good news! Testing, contact tracing, isolation, quarantine, border closure; iirc ‚Äúcircuit breaker‚Äù lockdown careful reopening. Probably limited US probably started Germany. Cheeseface Testing symptom onset 67% chance false negatives, infectiousness peak day symptom onset. super-spreader events happen infected person feeling perfectly fine time, time come symptoms late. decide go, distancing, holding activities outdoors, and/or masking would make safer, assume everyone virus-free due negative tests. Take care. asked others board they‚Äôre news source was, bet 99% people reply ‚ÄúThe Daily Show‚Äù. don‚Äôt like people thinking themselves, Joe huge threat agenda. feed far, reinfections rare. It‚Äôs even rare second time worse first. it‚Äôs still soon tell many eventually suceptible virus it‚Äôs common devolope severe symptoms first infection. hyperbole here.

A society murders old people make hospital stats better reciving pushback general population morally corrupt. Swedish politics isnt even virus anymore, gone back racist drivel evil immigrants are.

Cause Swedish society is. Deeply morally corrupt every level. Hiring political broiler high level manager, despite lacking required higher qualifications simply wrong. first time happens. Sinopharm one ones that's tested Brazil? pope wear masks.... good guy want Ratzinger back! Recombinations mutations frighten think. getting know beast changes something more.
On another note, agency record animal deaths towards final death counts situations like global pandemic? hyperbolic passed beeing hateful comedy. Belgium report probable deaths, confirmed cases. one countries seeing excess deaths year. truth this...but obviously made up. Hospitals receive 20% Medicare something classified covid 'presumptive positive"" rules require actual test. COVID symptoms mirror lot illnesses, reasonable say deaths misclassified financial incentive presumptively label patient covid w/o testing. sure fraud exists, likely docs labelling presumptive covid precaution tests limited slow Sinopharm one safer Oxford one? articles this? Well size holes important also layers. many large holes negate extra layers point so...  Nope. According article tested negative twice testing positive. thousands cases. 

Unless information different article choosing share? Yes, can. question answered, much way ""Can win lottery buy ticket?""

The pressing questions are:

1. base retirement winning lottery?
2. cases reinfection likely common enough defeat herd immunity?
3. get reinfected, likely mild inconsequential, same, worse? 
4. severity new infection depend severity previous one? Lol big families. used like too. I'm saving post use reply ""should wedding/what see come state vacation"" posts. country problem see tip iceberg moment. report last case Israel fact 25 million infected persons worldwide handful re-infected cases identified suggests rare phenomenon. Alternatively, critical rule new mutations introduced, covered existing expected immune response generated initial infection could prevent second case, least stave severe illness [7]. Unlike American Ecuadorian cases, occurred Hong Kong man, well Israeli repeatedly presumed people would become vulnerable Covid-19 time recovering initial disease, based immune system typically responds respiratory viruses, including coronaviruses [2]. possible early cases reinfection outliers features won‚Äôt apply millions people already recovered American Ecuadorian cases, researchers sequenced viral samples found different genetically, providing evidence re-infection stems viral mutations.... different report found cross immunity human alpha/beta type coronavirus, Considering see subtypes COVID-19 could end bad spot reinfections occur often. hardly testing March. symptoms test unless first responder, direct contact person known senior citizen. people cant take win. 80% patients marked death getting better despite approved covid treatments survived switching this. yeah, big deal. Mmmmm cheese really wonder surface risk actually someone touching face washing hands frequently. 

My job person wiping cart handles customers seems pointless (and, I‚Äôve done it, soul-sucking). Customers touch two carts separate ‚Äòsanitized‚Äô stack half can‚Äôt even wear mask properly anyway. 

Doesn‚Äôt feel worth I‚Äôm curious surface risk sensible people. Im gonna miss Winnie comedy gold alone. Arrogant fightmode Winnie, best Winnie. Replying auto mod deleted comment thinks threatening violence. WTF.

You fully understand risks.

The median age death 80s. means half people dying 80.

People 45 less 0.005% chance dying get infected, includes sick people 45.

Your particular case may higher risk, pretend everyone else risk category. people aren't. Remember time saw largest ball yarn?

Yeah.

Well time killed grandma grandpa inherited thier money.

Yeah.

#OrangePlague Depends source. Yes, would correct translation Yes. don‚Äôt seem understand trial phases work. It‚Äôs test vaccine volunteers make sure it‚Äôs safe. fact caught pausing evaluate see happened means aren‚Äôt rushing. person affected immune system, means could died virus.  Imagine thinking creepy kid sniffer reverse something that's happening last 20 years. Don‚Äôt say vaccines it‚Äôs two, especially one already back track. happens time. creepy kid sniffer president? That'd worse! I‚Äôve said make rethink position, ok hundreds thousands kids dying? depends bit size holes though - possible going wrongly fitted cloth mask N95 get leave small holes cheese.

So common sense guess. understand risks so.

The median age death 80s. means half people dying 80.

People 45 less 0.005% chance dying get infected, includes sick people 45. Nothing like murdering old make hospital stats look better.

How actual fuck getting away this. purposefully murdering citizens, thrown EU alone! long good read.

I'm wondering Stockholm region read national guidelines act case shortage hospitals something start immediately, regions same. guidelines ones saying keep oldest hospitals available beds.  Hard disagree. logic flipped head grossly overestimating risk virus implementing broad destructive lockdown measures going severe long term consequences. came said we've probably doubled child poverty lockdowns.

We pretty much know risks virus stage (young people die eventually fully recover) really make sense continue destroying people's lives lockdowns.

I understand lot folks posting live parents somewhat insulted effects this, parent lost job longer afford rent food - disaster - much worse virus probably shake days. early data releases China knew cytokines secreted response virus make sense likely immune response body naturally forming likewise nonsense.

Can link (an) article(s) that? know antibody tests, course know antibodies actually interact virus properly. I'm going start making masks Swiss cheese.

I read post fully.

Thanks advance saving Anti-vax family vegan cyclists.

/s feel like people even tried right thing getting tested. However, test results incorrect, are. lead people trusting results? Who's gonna apologize doctors saying months. case, 2 negative tests positive... months enough evidence considered anecdotal .... changed? ten days assuming symptoms last three cdc says ok. either except timeframe sent not, ten days within cdc guidance ...and would even accomplish? Probably unpopular opinion, come fake information. let everyone voice say whatever want, end like America, flat earthers, anti-vaxxers, covid deniers growing rapidly number... let it, fake news spread actual virus. First detected. many places able compare RNA current virus RNA previous infection? Sadly stereotypes true.

But antibodies anyway. covid deaths pneumonia. Blood clots leading cardiac arrest organ shut common. get chicken pox, virus life. never clear it. hides nerves come back form shingles throughout life. 

This virtually everybody. 

It's like saying HIV, get again. No, always it. totally agree u. dumb people everywhere.

Congrats singapore 7 slices Swiss cheese might actually trick Orthodox Jews really located New Jersey New York. rest anti-lockdown anti-mask sentiment hear coming America largely coming South, evangelical Christians ones mainly resisting public health measure. Anti maskers: ""it's fine wear mask that's one Swiss cheese layer removed like 10"" gives green light lie American people? health issue claiming masks save lives. many lives lost due lie? justify this. also best medical surveillance...other countries missed cases too. ""Active r/NoNewNormal""  many deaths attributed lockdown, disease? agree OP point (but date vaccines): sharing whole truth Americans masks huge tactical mistake, one people still paying lives. agree. virus spread much further.  used concept aviation classes. manufacturer misses bolt plane construction airline mechanic see pilot pre flight check misses too, leads crash missing bolt passed many cheese slices. 

You need put many cheese slices place possible prevent errors slipping through. Explains still bri-the mask on. 

I camambert another year though. silver lining, kernel hope looking doesn‚Äôt exist. Yes, ill, yesterday flurry news people getting second time worse. feeble doesn‚Äôt mean safer. get twice, also far likely die second time, assuming survive first.

This mass extinction event humanity. think it‚Äôs incredibly telling catastrophic things happening world year disproportionately affect humans. Mother Nature furious children becoming Medean mother. Frankly, species, deserve wrath. Millions upon millions going die - virus famine, climate disasters, violence. We‚Äôve good run masses become stupid use technology harnessed.

I intend one survivors. take hope quickly world started recover shut March. water Venice became crystal clear, birds filled cities, air cleared rapidly anyone ever suspected could, sky blue seen decades. Earth recover, population massively reduced.

Either choose start respect planet time chosen us. Earth fed up. Everyone counted herd immunity going die reinfected second, third time. Don‚Äôt forget 92% vaccines produced never make market. one currently production 8% chance making clinical trials, even it‚Äôs statistically unlikely silver bullet protects us.

Get N95 mask can. take 6 months produce. run out. Ok, tell massive uptick deaths happen highly connected symptoms Covid-19? far much faith America, White House didn‚Äôt even conduct contact tracing Rose Garden nomination ceremony senator caught virus. Oh dear, hope get that.

Physical distancing better term, since that's actually better description trying do. still social people long physically separated (e.g., video chats, online, outdoors, etc). would've died infectious disease condition everyone needs extra vit D,

/s makes sense-- one uses bullet cut cheese, make tiny cuts.  500-1000 US citizens dying per day real trend since July. world call ""under control""? NZ still pretty chillin hell would want live 25 years past 89. I'll welcome covid death 100 Misinformation flies truth comes limping after. Lies spread faster truth, it‚Äôs basic human behavior. Fortunately, massive percentage people won‚Äôt make 2022. Frankly, may make 2021 bad dying winter.

I‚Äôve stopped trying educate people mask safety. Ive sending N95 masks loved ones everything power keep safe quarantine.

You're supposed read write, comment that, write random assertions different stuff. put like that, guess right. hope waste money overinflated market though! describes coronavirus, looking differences two significant .

Thank post. Almost like every country covid problem survey highly misleading. That's $1000 dollars *savings accounts*. take account stock normal accounts. Ok going calculate many times someone goes work goes bar contract virus dies? You‚Äôre one originally made car accident comparison. Total numbers comes pandemic. may end needing Tesla ventilators all... God, America cesspit. Notwithstanding errors made stating requirements participate: trials gradually expanded likely suffer side effects they're proven safe populations less risk, rational person would design.

2 4 vaccine trials underway US SAE's. all. Plus sheer number people involved, expect random occurrences. may truly related vaccine, review boards involved almost certainly able discern those. ‚ÄúIf anything, it‚Äôs doomsday crowd revels death...‚Äù Lol, it‚Äôs telling project ideas onto another group order normalize gaslighting. 

And say empirical data supports you, yet don‚Äôt cite anything? strange, it‚Äôs almost don‚Äôt know you‚Äôre talking resort projection name-calling ‚Äúcoronabros‚Äù (that seriously dumb name, go back focus group one). 

Do anything scientific say, going pretend you‚Äôre going back forth aunt Facebook comments? Swine flu spread lot more. deaths. also claimed younger people. also said deaths probably underestimated. 
But point it, lots fear around yet nothing closed. Boomer flu comes around everyone panics closes everything, sending millions poverty. Great news. I‚Äôm sure similar coronavirus‚Äô we‚Äôll year (if longer) protection Yes many years ago? I'll give hint, quote. understand you‚Äôre joking, he‚Äôll TV studio.

Lotta personal audience thinking going on. 60 people tend think they've survived long beat anything might well live run clock. survivor bias takes over. there's nervous middle. driving highway among groups nerve racking enough. Came say this. First off, get sub stop reading news virus. Maybe stop watching taking news, period. nothing news offer point. sense wallowing misery something can't control.

Now things control. Wear mask go out, wash hands frequently. Stay away crowds best can, generally smart. that, go live life.

This over, numbers go winter people going indoors more, flu season, states opening back plan shutting again. 

I read sub get sense people feeling, honestly many still gloom doom stage. unhealthy going bring depression.

Vaccines way, learning every day treat virus cope it. careful smart, keep blasting brain negative information. going help way cause harm.  Uhhhhh think you‚Äôve got cabin fever, guy. don‚Äôt blame people fearful engaging economy especially knew death rate among working age people low.  Hell, still wear N95 plain masks go out. Anything less China style lock-your-grams-in house 2x4‚Äôs vaccine won‚Äôt stop though. might well let people whatever let smart people invest/use N95‚Äôs unless ICU‚Äôs med staff truly get overwhelmed la March *Nobody attends due curfew* thought well China better attitude. saw pool party picture this. Nope people stupid anywhere else world. come got rid it? Without vaccine virus infect proportion population eventually (some years) without measures, end won‚Äôt issue 10x people getting - would gotten point time anyway. It‚Äôs issue timeframe, load healthcare system many people get see vaccine first. Agreed...this huge accurate. believe taken pill form well need hospital receive IV like would Regeneron Eli Lilly therapeutics. 11% nationally? good.  What, 5 people millions? Yes, plus obvious super-spreader-type restrictions (indoor concerts, etc.) limp vaccine finish line.  lift corpse poverty? Lol morons mortality rate Coronavirus extremely small, rate people long-term lifetime complications insanely high. ""recovered"" stats give people false sense security. fucking flu, really bad flu damages organs. longer infectious mean ""healthy"" ""cured."" I'm 20's risk death low, desire live organ damage rest life. Unfortunately actually think stuff like indoor concerts tens thousands people reopen? Yeet rich. money hoarded unforgivable. Back beat virus like seems now. Ontario holding steady better average great. Lots places Canada dealing Covid better. phased reduction restrictions coupled schools opening weather are. major concern still schools lack foresight testing volume available went down. we're back peddling trying reduce cases. recent study saw 4 months protection, ‚Äú5-7 months‚Äù.

Great news. sure, lots times ""surge"" means 30 cases. say confirmed it, can't find? virus widespread, crazy. many celebs powerful people tested positive. CNA making $16 hour untrained aide makes $15, would raise pay would people seek credentials? know what? Fuck em. laugh way ventilator. ""Death rate"" pretty vague. definitely metrics judge by, like ""continuous trend likelihood Covid death time"" US probably come last.

Much Spain's rate high high point spike high, example. median ""How many people died Covid today per citizen"" days together, US may take home champion belt exception Brazil India. you‚Äôre ‚Äúthis zombie apocalypse‚Äù bandwagon get downvoted üòÇ  time dodge coronabullet. You‚Äôve got couple different misconceptions here. First, viral PCR test use useful first test. People already infected continue shed virus long longer contagious. treat people negative even though shed viral particles often appear positive test. Further, PCR usually used specific strain. result tell viral particles shed new infection original.

On top that, almost certainly level resistance virus lasts period time. That‚Äôs vaccine works, isn‚Äôt case Covid really big trouble. flu vaccine protects somewhere three six months. Nobody knows long resistance would last Covid. Please note flu vaccine contains multiple strains every year, person second strain Covid.

The last thing aren‚Äôt taking consideration post Covid symptoms. People Covid experience ongoing symptoms extended periods time. entirely possible existing symptoms call post Covid syndrome.

Taking consideration, it‚Äôs difficult say don‚Äôt thousands reinfections. don‚Äôt know. Healthy people also drop dead strokes etc.

Doesnt mean happens lot really struggled moving gym basement gym. sort stopped working couple months. got back working less exercises like. half set pullups, stop half. Done, success, another half set next time. struggle lot people, good luck, find way think US job recovery despite higher infection numbers? 

What cause recovery? I'd like links. estimated 151,700-575,400 people worldwide died (H1N1)pdm09 virus infection first year virus circulated. 

(estimated, tested positive)

So Covid killed 2X 8X times many people, less time, despite far fewer people getting COVID due drastic precautions we've taken. 

They simply comparable. Let's put cheese faces No, think not. I'll tell waste time learn.
That's what's going happen. Good luck ever collecting bill. There‚Äôs always loans hear you. many gym getting default space joining team like-minded comrades compete with. hard build solo dedicated environment. video class youtube even comes close. Ahahahhahahahhahahhahahahhahahhaaaa.  funny. magic bullet save us. mass extinction event species. Black Death took 8 years kill many did. Instead hoping miracle cure preventative (92% vaccines fail clinical trials, 8% make market) living forever. Ah see - thought European Union Authorization lmao don‚Äôt agree it, freedom expression important. that‚Äôs price I‚Äôm willing take don‚Äôt care anti vaxxer covid denier, know true don‚Äôt. site generated lists adults tested within study period laboratory result; adults laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 selected random sampling case-patients. case-patient, two adults negative SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test results randomly selected control-participants matched age, sex, study think Roxchic nailed upthread; conflicting info others nearby skipped. question larger studies mask use say, one study 154 people change that. good luck convincing local anti-mask facebook groups.

EDIT think misunderstood original point. He's legit riot. Dont go then. difference make you?  sure getting senile it‚Äôs political statement, would disagree. Sars-Cov-2 appears higher mortality flu spread easily, degree justifies shutting economy restrict constitutional rights like this. Haha! That‚Äôs hilarious. I‚Äôm half-Jewish raised secular. went Birthright last year, awesome! right?! sell baja blast cans now! almost affected entire world USA plenty time see going happen observing tear Europe Asia.

There's little actually ""proven"" definitively point, vast weight evidence conferred immunity generally robust, least within time period observed. I'm setting policy, bro. think spoons begin with. Education free. don‚Äôt pay top taxes. Unless course go way get kind special education, normal ones; business, law, medicine, languages, poli.sci., etc, etc. tax-funded. Europe worse US regarding covid.

They became complacent paying heavy price. Ay carambolas de Cancun mis tacos chihuahua burrito fajita senior Martinez Hernandez looked several state graphs - South Dakota Wisconsin starting look like SpaceX launch Well, aviation still safe, despite couple accidents happen every year. It‚Äôs big picture counts. fuck entire economy lokdowns 4-5 months ok? solution? Maybe short term, long term no, 4-5 months lower new cases destroy economy years. hate images like don‚Äôt least touch immune system. 

Good rest vitamins/nutrition important these! proven cases reinfection person asymptomatic times. 

One problem, though - virus spread asymptomatic people. fact remains though virus Netherlands severe flu. let thing run. good health system there, better locking everything you. Uhhh...are wrong sub? Sportsball nonessential could considered murder I'm trouble accepting testing defensive. Maybe mean process identifying isolating infected people. would make sense, testing stopping transmission. stay. Covid19 marks end world knew it, yes, ""generation event"", consequences far, far future.
Look vaccine trials getting stopped everywhere phase 3. direct information pharma boys yes, fucked.
The time could prevented thing spreading downfall December early February. Nothing happened, politicians, air travel big business want think happens next.
We fucked now. Corona ever go away again. We'll live it. funny people tow ideological line sub people crying ""paranoia"" ""racist"" shut borders cancel international flights January February. every time mention this, one denies it.

Us young healthy people extremely low risk complications virus. We're done sacrificing best years lives people telling everyone paranoid government said be. Bunch NPC's. 


I'll wear mask, put back in-person classes stop locking economy causing lose internships, I'm going start thinking bad thoughts. Right, used met American abroad might tease little bit likely cool open people Well it‚Äôs physical distancing public could still get surface sometimes linger air. home deliver driver. Stuff like that. Still MS case ? proven vaccine ? trust information hearing COVID-19 non-US sources. CFR goes sustained community spread commensurate testing. Mortality per capita comparable. Nobody would argue testing likelihood exposure goal national response. make *excellent* points. bad sad lil troll u/nythro won‚Äôt reply... friend who‚Äôs residency ER said Covid relaxing time she‚Äôs ever doctor. basically patients. course fewer people fewer accidents forth probably also lot people going treatable conditions later worsened. Also undertesting Ok, maybe make guy green like already got rona? I‚Äôm sorry point still don‚Äôt know virus airborne you‚Äôre helpless. wasn‚Äôt lie, ended accurate

If say inaccurate things intent manipulate, saying ""isn't lie"" lie itself. still trying manipulate, saying something that's inaccurate.

You're lying, words. Buy real bike. road free. Spin class weakest sounding thing I've ever heard. Yes, think live whole vaccine. also think based past failures vaccines developed animals along failure whole inactivated virus vaccine SARS animal testing, must high alert ADE. mechanism described fact involve live virus.


That said, look HPV vaccine, vaccines made create strong response virus immune system struggles natural infection. look forward inevitable creation vaccine. like HIV herpesvirus, vaccine completely possible. believe is, covid simply much better survival strategy SARS had. better stay low hide asymptomatic hosts trash hosts like SARS did. Careful opening = leaving stuff closed. make workers man stores send kids school. response abysmal Yes. broad-stroke generalization creates issues opens possibility anti-semitic really specific group Jewish community even non-Orthodox Jews issues with.

By logic, Trump's ""drink bleach"" good advice. mean good *for you* probably good opinion, best interests heart,

Your opinion worthless though, emotional appeal. Even draw little pictures crayon you, say stuff like ""they're manipulating sake good"". bizarre.  right million things could've done back March hands kind tied. CDC's tracker says 46,000 new cases today. can't contact trace 46,000 cases day. can't real isolation short telling people self-quarantine. we're left depending people right thing we've proved won't. plenty cheeses made BIPOC. healthcare profit organization, want people unhealthy. news still? model also used hospital settings :) Like cucumber dildo üòäüòâ I've situation officers refused release footage somewhere 3-5 months. attorney filed discovery &amp; took long respond request thought going *stall court case out.*

 Without details, pretty worthless conclusion. what‚Äôs solution? Social distancing forever? That‚Äôs absurd. it‚Äôs gets reasonably low levels spread nearly everyone else resume normal behavior. world difference handled United States. Im US, cases rising. president says virus harmless going go away, going disappear soon. tells people wear masks socially distance. staff holding huge rallies, indoor outdoor, thousands people, shaking hands, giving high fives. leading Covid-19 expert hit World Health Organisation handling pandemic - suggests New Zealand instead look East direction.  agencies like WHO, US Centres Disease Control Prevention (CDC) European Centre Disease Prevention Control, New Zealand traditionally looked to, ""let us badly"" Covid-19.  elimination approach's use tight border management ""short, sharp"" lockdowns differed drawn-out lockdowns used Europe North America, could suppress virus.

It's secret there's significant political interference COVID-19 measures CDC ECDP political interference spilled WHO.

Canada lockdown again. Schools open, borders still letting international travellers in. New Zealand fact poster child soft pandemic measures quarantine sick isolation points entry.

Really need step point start supporting scientific-based research long-standing medical practices implemented pandemic.

Start acting accordance what's best everyone stop worrying twitter says it. 

Getting really, really hard day argue lockdown deniers. think words cause effect, purposeful inaction many politicians make feel starting scratch everyday progress. Bro. That's literally quote source also put. even doing? embarrassing. well no. measure taken control spread, also spread itself.

Uncontrolled pandemics bad economic activity. studies anything gives insight long immunity lasts covid?, since know reinfections possible make harder vaccine made? could covid vaccine become like flu vaccine need one every year?, Lol there‚Äôs going stimulus package restrictions won‚Äôt get stricter.

You see I'm going this. Probably difficult find straight comparisons (e.g. similar population, similar viral spread, amount goverment money intervene), please do.  CT done well all. see mask usage flagging, people becoming complacent. 
I think people stay vigilant social distancing, mask wearing common sense manage coming months. 
It‚Äôs want , it‚Äôs science points us.  study going fuel never mask people. fails account significantly riskier behavior eating higher density areas general scale contact tracing. allowed early active information policing control spread, able warn people visited certain place get tested.

This huge part we're making pandemic relatively low numbers opinion.

Here NSW, contact tracing thorough begun release exact times, dates specific bus/train routes infected person travelled on.

Here Sydney, feel mask-wearing decent considering us Westerners adverse wearing - reckon bushfires really primed us it, obv Melbourne mandatory outside home.

I think fact conservative pollies (aside goofball leading country dragged kicking screaming pro-active decisions) would normally act like people making fuss nothing taking pandemic seriously trusting government's handling situation, especially we've sitting relatively low numbers (&lt;10 - 0) NSW/a reasonably populous metropolitan city like Sydney fair length time. people mean conservatives never give shit detected antibodies identical ones provided short term immunity feel comfortable saying provide immunity watching case numbers closely. want mom able visit Christmas, fly. self-quarantine 7 days get tested visit flight presents main risk.

The *projections* holiday season good, common sense would suggest millions people traveling time presents real risk airports. 

But I've learned public policy country is, best, unpredictable. result peaks valleys come gone, often different times different places. know, early November could see huge spike reinstitute restrictions crap ton places actually flattens curve little. 

So I've asked parents hold breaths anything. pencil calendar, might happen. hate covid. takes days virus replicate enough picked swab. According test best accuracy 8 days post infection (20% risk false negatives.)

""Over 4 days infection typical time symptom onset (day 5), probability false-negative result infected person decreases 100% (95% CI, 100% 100%) day 1 67% (CI, 27% 94%) day 4. day symptom onset, median false-negative rate 38% (CI, 18% 65%). decreased 20% (CI, 12% 30%) day 8 (3 days symptom onset) began increase again, 21% (CI, 13% 31%) day 9 66% (CI, 54% 77%) day 21."" turns everyone

""China communist totalitarian Nazi country course numbers low"" posters? even amazing burqas forbidden certain spaces law, can't enforced. Come now... point cannot know sure whether infected pre-symptomatic without waiting 14 days (the quarantine shortened 10 something like 99% develop symptoms, within 10 days).
Granted, asymptomatic would never know positive without testing, even waited full quarantine period. testing negative close recent contact positive person means LIKELY (given possibility false negative) asymptomatic carrier. mean pre-symptomatic.

An effective testing policy would everyone quarantine (without symptoms) tested 10 days, weed asymptomatics leave house again. random testing find many asymptomatic carriers possible, walking around unnoticed. regardless testing, quarantined 10 days. Interesting. haven‚Äôt read even article tbh. general that‚Äôs trials I‚Äôve experience work mean get fed money

""Young middle-aged COVID-19 patients mild symptoms dying strokes,¬†The Washington Post¬†reports. Researchers Philadelphia-based Thomas Jefferson University Hospitals, New York City-based NYU Langone, New York City-based Mount Sinai Beth Israel Hospital intending publish data regarding COVID-19 patients 30s 40s suffering strokes. Though dozen cases per location, data suggests COVID-19 patients mostly experiencing large vessel occlusions ‚Äî deadliest kind stroke ‚Äî destroy parts brain responsible movement, speech decision-making.¬†
Many researchers believe strokes may direct consequence COVID-19 related blood clots, others wonder whether seeing young patients resistant respiratory problems caused COVID-19.
The virus appears result mild illness majority young adults. However, COVID-19 stroke patients New York City-based Mount Sinai average 15 years younger stroke patients without COVID-19, according J. Mocco, MD, neurosurgeon researcher.""  ‚ÄúI sorry loss... money. tank must expensive.‚Äù Unfortunately shingles vaccine really available anyone 50. 60. shingles 35. really sucked.

Edit: know early enough, they‚Äôll give antiviral might able avoid getting blisters. able avoid fate I‚Äôm tough able rationalize symptoms: mosquito bites, spider bites, heat rash. couldn‚Äôt rationalize anymore. still prescribed antiviral wreaked havoc scalp worst dandruff possible. It‚Äôs like scalp flaked tiny pieces week. Thanks beta tester us! I'm totally fine messaging public right now. people really hard time length severity pandemic, beginning kind weeks time. 

Can imagine beginning like, ""ok historically 18 months question,"" half people would set neighborhood fire.

If vaccine 75% effective whopping 75% Americans get vaccinated, leave 50% us protected, plus anybody disease recently. 

Not would call ""back normal"" know right away. ""Yes, sure, concerts masks end summer. Uh huh, yep! Almost there!""

Whatever need tell help muster enough stamina give *right now.* I've heard many people going last longer think should, give up. really though I‚Äôm reading article, say need scapegoat scapegoat bats. look fuckers eyes. Fuck bats Justin you? That's document says. pausing enrollment. convening safety study well stopping follow care. kind story causes wild claims, like ""Only 6% deaths actually COVID"" story misinterpreted misquoted. 

I hope everyone ready ""Lockdowns killed least 75,000 people US, calling end them.""  else willing 1000$?  interested heist all? People absolutely believe crap like this. governments, hospitals, doctors, giant conspiracy benefit billionaires. That‚Äôs shitty thing many right wing conspiracies: they‚Äôre almost always rooted tiny truth capitalism. check often anti vaxxers talk ‚Äúbig pharma‚Äù without idea big pharma operates - basically, like shitty business - doesn‚Äôt connect ‚Äúvaccines conspiracy put microchips kids.‚Äù anti flu shot. Never felt like needed one. elderly bad health though? small singular island somewhere according reddit... US LIKES SAY COUNTRIES LYING ORDER HIDE LYING. THAT'S NEW BAD LEVEL. government lockdowns then? gotta pick stance stay  10x number Vietnam deaths die every year US. realized buffets never coming back, I'm really sad get people claiming masks anything. using 400 fucking years prevent disease. Masks effective used effectively even knew bacteria was.

How would one disease different every disease ever history world? Justin you? think it‚Äôs axiomatic, ever hear Andy Dick‚Äôs voice guest spots Pierce‚Äôs drug hallucination Community. Yes, US think tanks horrifyingly effective global age internet. they‚Äôre less ‚Äúcentralized‚Äù ‚Äúshadowy sinister‚Äù vast majority infected young people. Less likely hospitalized appreciate though. inspired research discover 8.5% deaths get autopsy.. far cry everyday fully investigated medical examiner hypothesis.

Learned something new arguing hysteric. gratitude internet dude. it‚Äôll restart days. Agree. first expanded older, younger. Things must going well. Fingers crossed. It‚Äôs actually 11 confirmed September. Yes it‚Äôs low number, many going undetected? Well religions around thousands years, don‚Äôt think change happen quickly . least still burning witches stake Average age population seems big factor. 2020 over...

COVID resurgence, election, new supreme court justice, top policing still menu. poor cousin chicken pox 3 times. mild cases, still sucks. Plus, probably fewer people dying things like accidents too, excess deaths probably compared lower baseline. Romania. Sure Y‚Äôall read right? appear damn secondary deaths everyone warned about. Scaring people death never went ER treatable illnesses. 

A family one town me‚Äôs son serious mental healthy issues couldn‚Äôt get normal treatment March/apr lockdowns. doom gloom snapped. Killed parents himself. that‚Äôs death covid. That‚Äôs death covid. Much like article pointing out. think look needless cancer , stroke, overdose heart attack deaths 10 year‚Äôs going look like barbarians encouraging! Hopefully placebo group get things started within days.  Hospitals paid per Covid case. Facebook fact. ‚Å∞ Popcorn lung probability give get 0 vaccines? Implying another global lockdown series lockdown next years. Yup. One reasons country cross roads fact religious fanatics hijacked country, need science front center, crazy beliefs [Thats Yeah, Democrats. make trump look bad they're rigging election, lol. worldwide plan led Democrats? Common sense evaporated large portions country. Pfizer lead. saw POS let's magnify contempt disrespect lives wearing mask infected possibly still contagious covid.

This mind blowingly selfish. clear virus, demonstrated multiple negative tests.

The hypothesis re-infection possible disproven. cases reinfection.

Very, positive tests sent sequencing. fact people infected twice, infections sequenced extremely rare event. number incidents growing, must conclude reinfection actually quite likely. make horrible arguments ignorant. according actual scientific studies. Let's stick using scientific evidence, bro-science like candle example. 

RCTs gold standard determining something works not, single RCT found masks work. Every single one found masks stop transmission influenza-like viruses.

Prove wrong, please. Post RCT showing masks stop transmission infleunza-like viruses.

Viruses simply small, masks porous, meaningful effect. candle example, extinguished breath also many larger particles condensation droplets exhaling, large pass mask stopped masks. Again, viruses small cannot stopped masks. % positive tests steadily climbing state, yet hospitalizations staying pretty steady. hoping seeing less severe mutation. certainly seeing lot testing young healthy people like children, college students professional athletes. Nope makes sense, yes. Mask wearing hand washing, social distance, works proven slow spread trust science. grandpa died June July. old fading years thanks dementia, thanks Covid Dad rest immediate family cross border Canada. Even could would quarantine 2 weeks matter what. watch funeral zoom. significance/usefulness double-blind testing? I'm little confused worry dad. essentially bound room 7 months whereas would leave everyday. really. more, Republicans allowed whatever want protests mentioned make fine.

nobody ever said Republicans excelled logic That's literally way herd immunity without vaccine achieved. They‚Äôve gone plaid! mean stop now? Smart people scare stupid people. Lol dude accurate, thank you. warns pursuing herd immunity stop coronavirus


Then must missed title article discussed here.  imagine many vaccines go issue. Sucks everything microscope nowadays. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs fine. degrees heart attacks. chest pain think ribs lungs, lingers far longer twinging nerve should. think yourself, heart attack, pretty mild. pain gets worse. longer goes, frightened feel. go hospital, adding COVID risks top everything else, start thinking, might kill stay calm ride out. crew, religion beats science everyday  pause study whole. Pauses proceed holds last weeks, months, years invalidate results since patients aren‚Äôt studied critical time. saying that‚Äôs going happen (very doubtful) certainly giving shots. Since we‚Äôre half-assing assume published statistics 50% what‚Äôs actually happening? 92% vaccine programs produce vaccine goes market.

And typically take years, months, develop. 

None pauses problems surprise. can't believe many apparently sane intelligent people know swallow conspiracy theories whole think they're clever. relevant mention heart issues come territory, entirely possible death nothing virus. also possible made otherwise survivable minor health issues unsurvivable. mystery never know answer to, unfortunately. held outside. video looks indistinguishable hundreds protests taken place cities every week since May.

If gonna criticize one criticize mass gatherings. No, always ""person dies reinfection"" first comment always ""well, fat?""?

People suck. seek minimize value life attacking people died.

How this: agree people dying important,? 

And this: take drastic actioms save them? ‚ÄòWe‚Äôre winning , fantastic job, let tell people saying it‚Äôs amazing job I‚Äôm doing. cures coming beat China virus we‚Äôre winning. Fantastic.‚Äô hear one time. Like time. yesterday client idaho works cardiac sonogram specialist (not sure phrasing something like that) lecturing this. truly try engage clients things, stated think numbers dramatically reported. 

She smugly chuffed like moron bitchy rest time together. fucking ass hats. disagree doctor would never call people aged 31-49, young adults. one comments take actual national average age stroke victims reduce average 15 years young per article. match range all. 

I believe faux paux numbers don‚Äôt even match use 15 years younger average. Nothing matches use numbers I‚Äôm advised commenter. leads use numbers range article establish, 30-40. sudden, article makes sense except word ‚Äúwithout‚Äù used describe range 15 years applies too. 

I don‚Äôt believe 15 year young average applies older age ranges, instead age range article provided us with. makes sense, also falls line doctors telling newspapers journals medicine. another perfect example conspiracy covid related deaths treatments overlapping covid symptoms would instantly paid without audit""

What kind moron actually believes stupid bullshit that? na√Øve one gullible? Guy got 148 page, million dollar bill. Uncle San picked tab... making show passing stimulus package there‚Äôs quadrillions going hospitals. people forced work, spending much higher since hospitals charge arm leg treatment. It‚Äôs common sense... don‚Äôt. Simple short reason pandemic become political football. 

Every speaker, writer, pundit, politician agenda. 

Every medical organization political agenda. Pro guy, anti guy.

My theory proven correct 22 days. exactly. flu season year. soon anyone slightest symptom they're going stay home people want around. worry, sociopaths assured million deaths okay vast majority people survive. /S Keep mind can't un vaccinate someone pause new shots effect however many thousand already got it. gonna keep going meess fucking admin. Yes, know actual covid deaths 20-40% higher confirmed counts. Source? Like legit... what's source BS? co-worker tell thing must put someone reach. Hannity? Alex Jones? little weird dude...what's name... Ben Shapiro? 2020 year death person forced work slavery, matter get return labor. find crazy people say hospitals pharma make covid numbers believe others say hospitals pharma greedily profiting private health insurance close friend died avalanche, joke, 2011. coworker recovering it, mom died August. August start real shitty months everyone work; knew mom well. statement absolute bullshit ! far many claimed deaths due covid, ignoring conditions. think missed point. It‚Äôs intertwined. people die due COVID-related concerns explicitly COVID, avoiding going doctor, eating well, depression alone esp elderly, increased stress nearly everyone country, worse domestic abuse victims get escape abuser now, people live alone (esp elderly) less likely around others medical emergency. 

I don‚Äôt think anyone (any reasonable person) would argue would fewer deaths without lockdowns, definitely going increased number deaths tangentially related big shift world. sucks even harder get good data events, cause won‚Äôt tracked well explicitly COVID related deaths (and that‚Äôs saying something considering poorly COVID deaths tracked). You‚Äôre forgetting American cheese respiratory virus defense noticed last upgrade iPhone option Exposure Notifications. sure that‚Äôs option you, thought nice addition. [Even alternative starvation. [Unfortunately Honestly, it‚Äôd attract customers He's irrelevant hate see medical bill I'm pretty annoyed previously thought balanced mature media coverage (NBC New York).

They're subtle worded pause way implies ""this bad news, Johnson &amp; Johnson *saying* normal"".

I know surprised media exists sell thrives controversy come on. simply commit joining international effort cooperate rest world? Imagine Putin said exact thing, declined join global initiative. would conclude Putin? conclude Biden. good analogy üòÇ Denmark one swine flu widespread? Sumer people invent Sumerian, making possible transcend space time writing system. One first uses identify cheeses belonged creating Mesopotamia‚Äôs first demand market dairy second rice.

P.S. dry sense humor. comes grieving families understanding doctors‚Äô questions. Say you‚Äôre dinner parents dad heart attack. call 911 ambulance rushes hospital. dies within hour arriving ER. hospital fill death certificate. know died heart attack isn‚Äôt one regular patients don‚Äôt know else may suffering from. ask family things like ‚Äúhad recently tested positive Covid?‚Äù 

People don‚Äôt understand death certificates list multiple causes death. hospital doesn‚Äôt records don‚Äôt want waste Covid test someone passed it‚Äôs easier ask family. deny reality world want, makes look feel sane.  really annoys ‚Äòsurface cleaning‚Äô isn‚Äôt ‚Äòhand hygiene‚Äô. one they. lot suspected reinfections turned false alarms lingering infections. doctors going apologize world instilling fear unnecessarily? course either. Maybe we're wandering around dark thing us acting good faith trying best. like industries involve risk. 

No single prevention model ever perfect, introducing several layers reduces overall risk. 

I shocked find people general get this. basis do, rules regulations around us. Maybe use swiss cheese aviation, solid cheese instead? Like parmesan gouda? would solve hole-alignment problem. husband's family rented huge houses huge bedrooms kids/families, 5 bedrooms might plenty 14 people, 2 bathrooms? Nope. way.  It‚Äôs rough 40 years so. didn‚Äôt get overnight. Except physical distancing done properly account aerosols. see holes plan Additionally, model still expanded upon, adding layers organizational level. Government policy certainly act several different layers model, individual level even less risk. 

Systems thinking key solving disease, everyone thinking individual level. mental health problems due lockdowns. Covid would say locking things allowing virus spread places pretty much exactly like peeing section public pool. Knowing half battle. Youre boutta eat words causes strokes 2 years later But, particles moving air follow flow? pressure movements? straight line like bullet. Ok trumpet Security called ""defense depth"". Common sense common. mean I‚Äôm probably gonna get downvoted hell back, know anecdotal cases, (see below) occur. Whether it‚Äôs money don‚Äôt know. think it‚Äôs probably related cautiousness towards virus causing misdiagnosed patients that‚Äôs ‚Äúit‚Äôs money‚Äù thing gets thrown in, despite majority nurses know claim thing seen hospital financial reports.

 two confirmed cases people said corona virus either died got sick despite virus. uncle New Jersey died stroke, taken hospital aunt wasn‚Äôt allowed see him, told passed day stroke cause death corona virus cremated without asking March-April time frame. Probably story aunt telling us, grieving widow it‚Äôs appropriate even imagine ill intentions.

My cousin meningitis, told Corona, didn‚Äôt go back hospital three days extremely sick went back second opinion correctly diagnosed. 

So it‚Äôs widespread Facebook media proclaims it‚Äôs definitely reasons, happen, aware mindful engaged discussion people claim true rampant among hospitals. boyfriend same. cheaper drive OC Tijuana dental care. Title correct. study finds 67% excess deaths contributed covid, relation simulation. state remaining 33% might caused covid, unclear. governor acts satisfy Dear Leader Orange House. see pretty adamantly pro choice here's one you:

Theres one abortion clinic state they're booked perform abortion. Maybe thought consequences pregnancy unprotected sex. personal choice so. Fuuuuuck used world renown scientists. Glad I‚Äôve become professional artist quarantine, 8 years education beyond high school worth less every passing day. Sweden right, admit already. think wanted us put Swiss cheese face used well rail safety Australia well. remain introverted eat cheese instead? like people best times, pandemic makes easier justify life style. people still trouble understanding death sentence thought was. better treatment, harvesting effect. mean take seriously. fucking course needs taken seriously. Medium long term effects still issue. Overwhelming hc system also huge concern happens, mortality rates go up. means solace actual ifr. (Found vids really reads like covid pandemic, hoax videos YouTube plentiful)

News reports warning people: lapse project:. bridge higher normal, extra careful drop section destroy road Mondays commute. remember right, step one cover road shit ton gravel protect (and remove shit ton 5 am). 

And Carmagedon ""hoax"" vids: actually shocked many hoax videos were. using swiss cheese then? Yes, instead making fun Anti-Mask americans, talk language understand: cheese. great Wait, GIJoe *not* reliable source history dairy?? /s want go gargantuan errand Irresponsible people holes cheese. point multiple layers redundancy make those. Putting green guy next infected person would fine green guy following safety protocols (like standing close next someone). Feinstein responsible? far that... tracing apps failed one downloaded them. He's right.

What's point herd immunity immunity relatively short-lasted?

Many people die year year, many get long-term health problems.

The civilised way fight pandemic ensure gradual rearrival normalcy vaccine. alot ethically questionable bad conclusions draw fact life cheap impoverished countries. Bottom line cheap first world, thats practical comparison end day. First world inhabitants measure wealth counts hundreds thousands dead african children. individuals need take responsibility. team effort. I'm concerned reinfection time. always possible, something like bound happen. feel bad woman passed, medical condition normal comparative population large. People chemo totally modified basically defeated immune system. likely stopped body producing protective antibodies. Haha, going bring show - know still on? Season 20 aired beginning year. I've watched nearly them, maybe two instances one thing cause accident. getting jollies watching sick people die. governor act according constitution laws. governor act according constitution laws tyrant. Since people read headlines, soon see News, creating even fear people. point yes, going see cases reinfection, still good sign we've seen thus far. Okay....first all, Coach Mullen many fans allowed stadium. university officials...but y'all already know üôÑ

Second, comments come Gators played Texas A&amp;M, socially distancing appeared lax say least. There's speculation made comments frustrated A&amp;M abide rules (&amp; deflect blaming coaches/players loss vs A&amp;M). press conference yesterday double :90,000 fans game' comments. 

This yet another example people reading headline &amp; thinking they're expert situation... Masks interesting example use, remove labels diagram could masks. That‚Äôs lot people wearing masks two layers fabric well pocket inside install filter... much like metaphorical slices cheese, actual physical layers mask compensate imperfections layers mask.

This kind quite work way think. Multiple layers help some, additional layers really stop particles certain size getting (as carried air flow *around* mechanical barrier). [Here's video N95 masks use layers different electrostatic properties basic mechanical barriers. One richest technologically advanced countries way. seems shortage money F35 program though. Man even New Zealand‚Äôs populist nationalist leader witty. I'm talking beginning. Everyone started couple years, even year would kill work economy many lives. ‚ÄúI great deal faith American people ability realize we‚Äôre facing significant problem,‚Äù Fauci said.

Not rude paying attention? Wrong cult. thinking Jehovah's Witnesses. Nothing said specifically. mentioned nursing homes test staff ""generously"" avoid spread infection further. Well, cold basically spreading exactly way coronavirus. unlikely minor mistakes 62 fines one charge inciting riot. rather guess targeted certain places suspected mass gatherings nutjobs.

The fines go 15k. far live mom? within 12-hour drive, whole family isolate two weeks mom same? 

Then could hop car drive without stopping (pull pee side road necessary). 

I guess stopping get gas slight risk. outside mask sanitize hands after. Yep, cheese far predates Mongolian empire. One earliest written documents poem cheese. They're discussing taken seriously epidemic, making value judgement. Stop looking ways get upset offended. Eye covering given thought. stats show helps lot. He‚Äôs warning months, he‚Äôs wrong R.I.P. durch lady. whole life ahead her. OP bad defense? Yes, though would actually argue idea Covid deaths (those directly related infection) counted. testing margin error unlikely someone could infected die without counted. 

But importantly, yes, collateral damage response going far far far outweigh direct cost virus. fewer 150 deaths kids aged 0-17 US, yet every single one millions kids upended school, sports, social activities, etc. can‚Äôt even begin estimate impact long term education, social development, overall well being, etc. Millions affected, many kids spared death due Covid?

College students sort numbers. Again, many could actually saved?

What financial impact people 20-30s laid difficult start earning years, long continue impact life. 

How many elderly family members completely (or nearly) cut family, reducing quality life near zero. 

And mentioned, overall dread filling millions millions people would statistically minimally impacted actual infection. 

My hope point point get honest accounting NEVER make mistake again. 

Someone I‚Äôve following made great point, we‚Äôre (our response measures) it‚Äôs good thing do, we‚Äôre (technologically) it. 

Remote school absurd idea briefest emergencies, ‚Äúcan‚Äù it, are. examples exist, based ability something, regardless effectiveness. difference, point changed wording still socialize virtually without physically close others. think pandemic bad wait lose ice caps. People stupid. say stupid mean really, really, really fucking stupid. 
Buy electric mention testing capacity, considering increasing it? Thanks answer, nine months I‚Äôm losing mind. Seems like end sight virus dumbass judge cheese smell making gag. cheeses smell awful, like vomit (the chemical) taste heavenly. correct. One journalist asked got clear answer. still individual follow recommendations. Dont try show Anti Maskers. They'll start war this. Vote Blue


GOP lied. Americans died.

#Vote Blue That‚Äôs said possibly. work high risk job. individual hour began feeling sick. test yet wanted safe try protect wife. reality there's way realistically contact tracing get thousands cases day. comparing covid infections hospital beds relevant vast majority cases need hospitalization? much invent cheese cheese making... Stating obvious dude know cases obesity person's control 

&amp;#x200B;

Holy shit wrong even funny. us little vote, unfortunately. live state Republican/Conservative controlled. vote something believe in, 99% everyone else vote whatever party tells good time regardless crap stick screw us. goes politicians, (R) next name (D) opposition R already won.

My state also couple electors entire states population, whereas California nearly 50x states electors. electoral college sucks, redisticting voting year essentially redraw voting lines sure Republicans stay power. I've mostly projects home. think I'll bring bunch wood woodstove garage tonight. instead decided pizza vegetable. Um, seen graph south dakotas cases? fine pretty much year began exponential spike weeks ago yet slow down. 38 percent insane 60k people trial. lived town 60k heard *one* neurological illness happened town, would first reaction be:

1. Sucks person, shit happens; 
2. proves living near gas station/pylon/river causes neurological disease. I'm New Zealand originally, grew mostly Australia, currently living Midwest US. I've never worked hard get information!

I'm used public health campaigns, aimed reducing illness amongst population. guess financial investment public health system. dangerous misinformation campaign think Free Milk scheme 1950s school aged children basically forced drink milk free thought boost calcium. I've never reason mistrust government media health matters. Sure, lot crap touted tabloid type news made nothing shock value, obvious easily avoidable. 

Here US, reason educate public health matters. contrary, every ad break filled ads prescription medication med...such advertising prescription meds illegal Australia NZ still quite foreign me. public health messages I've seen anti-smoking ads last month, beginning tv ad social distancing mask wearing. October!

I read political leanings every news source. question information too. Finally I've relied people dealing virus, nothing gain lying it, sharing they're dealing with. Preferably global collaboration. difficult find. 

I'm always looking ways listen online conversations healthcare workers actively dealing virus. Co-worker came work today extremely excited football game attended weekend 20,000 people. felt completely safe. Pissed off. state allow things neighboring state. state requires quarantine go another state go gathering 500 people. said going quarantine either want to. Pissed even more. People like cases trending upwards. can't complain regulations things going make regulations necessary. I'm Joe Rogan fan all, I've maybe heard one interview life.

But overweight? Trump said wants kiss supporters right now. Kiss death. üòò BTW Swiss cheese model example bad preventative strategy, good one. continue isolate. say lost job relationship virus like flu age group. It‚Äôs Party. It‚Äôs media, agenda, way reported. clear patients receive care hospitals offer.""

So fuck gets make decision worthy care?? Honestly true. insanely irresponsible give either platform equal weight unproven ideas compared majority expert consensus. think people satsify ego thinking ""know more"" others, matter potentially harmful incorrect information is. individuals control much, lot people forced go somewhere layers lacking control, work, public transportation, doctors office, essential shopping, indoor activity.

Upgrading cloth surgical mask KF94 N95 mask higher risk situations something everyone consider. filtration differences huge upgrading mask seen adding layer protection control. Cloth/surgical masks good layer protecting others, KF94/N95 masks good layer protecting yourself. like washing hands water vs water soap. Water gets 50% everything off, water soap gets 95-99% off. Lets fix large gaps. KF94 easy find online $2-3ea mask easily last week. USA made N95 masks available industrial stores $3-4ea. (shout /r/Masks4All information this)

But agree 100% adding layers helps lot, everyone put pressure local governments increase rapid testing, contact tracing, mask mandates, capacity limits, enforcement, etc.  definitely issue beginning. People continued day invincible mask. said masks ineffective precisely worthless effective alongside precautions like distancing hand washing. Cool, get sick stay away hospital. doctors nurses sign get COVID. want live like animal, ok dying like sick cat. said shortage. admitted later on. terrible counter argument. Especially considering two completely different topics. nowhere near level expertise. French toast, popcorn training harder last time it. I‚Äôm sure Singapore it, probably limiting persons pre-register only. lifted bans large events (we limited 100 indoors 500 outdoors masks times), large events require online booking seat reservation ensure social distancing. Events aren‚Äôt booked online would least require registration name cellphone number entrance. know surface cleaning actually something? It‚Äôs common action businesses haven‚Äôt figured it‚Äôs it‚Äôs simple action take. amazing thing survived first time. Thank much kind words. really means lot me. I've sleeping poorly last three nights since confronted him. hard people understand. Try explain like talking brick wall  You, everyone come contact with. 

I notice people reject pretty much always frame personal decision ignore greater impact family, friends, community. everyone odds do.  Chicken pox reinfection ""incredibly rare"". Many people know someone got twice. Second Varicella Infections: Common Previously Thought?  Among varicella cases reported surveillance project, 4.5% cases 1995 13.3% cases 1999 reported previous varicella. 95% first infections physician diagnosed, epidemiologically linked another case, rash description consistent varicella; true reported second infections. People reported reinfections generally healthy. family history repeat infections 45% people reported reinfections. many stories like this. People still telling ""You can't live fear!""  H1B's propelling america forward Fauci also said masks made things worse beginning. means make mistakes Well also layer Secret Service bodies get past. leave serve think least recognizable country get back. Save us Corona. You‚Äôre hope. guess depends have. PhD statistics work governance level risk analysis normal part job. Karen‚Äôs think best defense offensive. you‚Äôre saying masks don‚Äôt work? /s may true people, apparently figured countries‚Äô decisions mandate masks.

Personally, wearing mask helps remind step away people encounter, keep vigilance. really think without I‚Äôd done backsliding now. American cheese sure ain‚Äôt workin matter us president, greater 0 deaths would occurred. China got virus control spread, 0 US deaths would occurred. Trump incompetent, traced back china. Oooo like way put this. true right? Great idea. Hopefully need best prepared. Libs different conservatives comes unjust laws. love authoritarianism long right people.  don‚Äôt think thought risks either, it‚Äôs clear we‚Äôre going agree topic need argue further! Still pushing disinformation huh? Anyone got pneumonia respiratory failure COVID would part 6%. Neither would 40% population hypertension diabetes. Grandma lived many years unable recognize children  know trust more. gaslighting killing me. Likely not. IRB protocols pretty strict almost certainly double blind study. Meaning would bit complicated ""just checking"" practice. Wait minute!

The guy pic wearing appears fabric mask, yet illustration shows effective masks made swiss cheese. 

Additionally, hands, what's hand hygiene for?

Your move, science. Would nasal spray something we'd take daily? Fuck off.

Enjoy permanent lung, heart, brain kidney damage.

Asshole horrible way explain masks filter particles, either. trouble is, go failure modes masks thick. Thank serving. time wasted. somewhat relate feel. Gone soon. One first questions reinfection came patients neutropenic. immunity sars still present 17 years feel like infection likely never big issue. Obviously horrible patients family however feel like significant factor terms herd immunity. 

Some cases without test first ""case"" reduces reliability according page linked 23 cases 38 million confirmed cases disease first documented 11 months ago. 

I'm hopeful affect vaccine combined strategy mitigation Alas, companies caused horrific pharma scandals ruined people's lives like Gr√ºnenthal (creators Thalidomide caused people born without arms legs) still around , decades later :/. worried reinfectjon, even incredibly low numbers. It‚Äôs honestly biggest fear right now, especially bad.  Nice work Singapore - hopefully get limited Asia-Pacific travel bubble going. Singapore, Taiwan, Vietnam, New Zealand various small Pacific islands. wanna hear crowd complain next time working class black man gets 9 years ounce reefer. Boo hoo, followed rules worry! hard time understanding value curfews, unless used strategically.

When cut hours day people things, compressing people together limited hours, opposite done.

 hate local grocery stores limited hours since COVID hit. used shop late night customers sparse. I'm forced go crowds. (I understand stores cut hours logistical reasons, certainly conducive social distancing.) Right? like 80 yesterday MN. probably need N95 though. Sure primary caregiver COVID-19 positive/suspected patient, absolutely wear one, cases overkill. one highest death rates world (14th think) curve declined sharply summer one Europe's lowest. Right increasing expect second wave take soon.

I think difference Sweden countries low population density we're pretty good following general social distancing recommendations. listen lot authorities safety nets mean people afraid stay home sick (anyone stay home 14 days 80% pay even need prove anything, employer can't challenge can't fire you). idea instead lockdowns restrictions people able live long time. said, feels like people take serious anymore know viable actually is.

I mind approach realistic long-term restrictions instead lockdowns really hoping mask mandate now. Medical professionals cautioned Trump shutting PREDICT initiative. shutdown White House group dealing pandemics. like people sitting around hell. guy looks solar eclipse. sure, checked news says there's another firm called Sinovac Biotech who's conducting Phase III trial Brazil. unclear whether there're one companies testing Brazil. saw bunch week, bunch kids without masks.

One little anchors running get take-out coffee (and sometimes pastry breakfast sandwich)from little coffee shop town. I‚Äôm anymore. People stupid. goes hate needs spelled look like it. God wish see instead campaign ads! Well, data people work data. feel agenda. Well, Trump GOP clearly one. 

My point though data. went masks useful mighty USA ending making video Surgeon General making mask t-shirts. r/coolguides That's true. let's say layer gives +10 protection stat, total +70 max possible. 

Imagine first layer one big hole provides +0 stat. air outside, still get +60 stat, zero effect layers. middle stack, first three provide +30 stat, big hole ineffective layer provides +0 stat, followed 3 layers, another +30 stat, totalling +60 stat. point bad layer effect good ones.

Each layer discreet unit quality control, I'm using extreme values simplicity (0 0% effective 10 100%). long underperforming layers something, net gain. 

Having poor ventilation negate work mask do, get worn faster filter worse air, capacity remains same. immunity first infection vaccine hitches, ever return normal life. pandemic fatigue killing need regular interactions Lab conditions isn‚Äôt real life conditions, helpful anyway? Ooh track trace app, would nice Texas. oh boy


I HOPE NOT, good thing got mental shithole got back healthy life style...


but idk enough mom


dad surprisingly ZERO symptoms despite obese (sry dad, ik u dont use reddit still)


or maybe got much earlier, cause got sick near beginning year. mid way tho, 3 us (and sure covid 19 flu ""common cold"")


dang, shitty people ones dont know better yet


I'll keep interested updated get sick like first time around, time tool me! cannabis American, analysis always based what's best society. Thank much!!! good model security. got downvoted saying man good something great at. thread ridiculous. want swiss cheese Funfact: holes cheese created bacteria living tiny hay particles cheese. years back Switzerland funded study fewer holes cheese past decade. conclusion study: due better milk treatment filtering, fewer hay particles milk. Nowadays add dirty milk filtered milk get holes cheese.

Is important know even relevant?
Not really, maybe nice story tell people stressed pandemic :) People argue layer introduces holes ... Thousands young people long recovery period vs. doubling child poverty rate.

I think thought risks here. live NB Canada single Covid death here, know top head 5 seniors died pandemic, 3 family. 

It's super odd, especially considering old people usually die summer, always happens winter they're fuckin bored can't leave house 6 months; exactly pandemic was.

It's secret end life mental state basically allows somewhat ""choose"" die. grandfather law died day two wife grief, sick way. mass vaccination. latest reports say \~12K people vaccinated far, that's drop ocean. Holy Moly! response. love it. I‚Äôve used similar idea engineering creating error free documents. multiple stages (checking, interdisciplinary review, approver‚Äôs review) errors caught, one perfect, it‚Äôs unlikely error missed. approach called 'defense depth'. approach risk mitigation new.

But also perfect. helpful visual!! Yes, 60,000 people sample, seems there'd always one two people coming mysterious illness based sheer numbers chance. We're never gonna get virus control, we? Yes not... 


For example, mask may generate subsconcious sensation security makes less alert comes hygiene social security. mask shitty, ending result may worse. shit. MIL didnt even get ventilator ICU.

We didn‚Äôt suck, facing impossible task. Convincing 300 million people it‚Äôs 100% safe go work, isn‚Äôt safe things make life worth living, won‚Äôt *years*. fucked badly March option something that‚Äôs beyond scope human ability can‚Äôt rush science. do, wind film, ‚ÄòI Legend‚Äô. Flesh eating zombie vampires. brother got angry calling pope dumb pandemic lmao No, he's saying people can't handle take baby steps. look president base, literally deny reality spite eyes. correct saying experts expect early mid 2021 cut pandemic status virus? guess anything good news long period negligence. Sunday effect. going several days now, take efforts check records. tragedy epic proportions. Truly unprecedented given know medical epidemiological perspective. Wearing masks, practicing social distancing, self-isolating symptomatic avoiding large crowds effective means controlling spread. strategies working, world.

Once rates went unfortunately people either got complacent, grew weary didn‚Äôt care. warm weather didn‚Äôt help respect maintaining behaviour changes.

Seroconversion rates started rise likely due social gatherings, especially summer. children went back school began cluster outbreaks similar happened LTC facilities earlier year. Yet school closures far (at least Canada I‚Äôm following local trends closely). I‚Äôm concerned schools going become new LTC epicentres. Also R0 really starting increase believe faster rate (would double check sure).

All preventable. sad.

‚Äú*Some thought moderate living avoidance superfluity would preserve epidemic. formed small communities, living entirely separate everybody else. shut houses sick, eating finest food drinking best wine temperately, avoiding excess, allowing news discussion death sickness, passing time music suchlike pleasures. Others thought opposite. thought sure cure plague drink merry, go singing amusing themselves, satisfying every appetite could, laughing jesting happened*‚Äù

People going whatever want.ü§í single news source consumers.

Actually, laugh ones defensively say, ""I get news one source!"" said sources are: Limbaugh, Fox News, Breitbart NewsMax, don‚Äôt believe anything anyone says anymore. completely packed week there. 

The place New England felt ‚Äòsafe‚Äô vermont. Commit crimes We've merely delayed inevitable. ""saved"" lives lost anyway within next 6 months. show CDC gives survival rate said, throwing random numbers don‚Äôt know means panic move. Got it. fairness also example SARS MERS, similar fizzled became global pandemics. 

So blame people taking seriously back then. Free healthcare, good doctors ofcourse luck. There‚Äôs ton information circulating society...some great lot crap! It‚Äôs person consider source try get multiple reliable sources confirming information.

I think family best get accurate information health local government officials. complied mandated shelter-in-place orders always wear masks practice social distancing public.

I say following recommended CDC guidelines, one among family friends become infected far.

So yes, trust information provided reliable sources! mean, exposure? Many people get wrong.

Exposure defined close someone (not socially distant) 15 minutes tests positive. Sorrento Therapeutics San Diego starting phase trials antibody solution. still can. I'm Minnesota I'm complete lockdown. get absolutely everything delivered work home. drive around 30 minutes every month keep car battery charged go people fucking EVERYWHERE. read news, I'd idea Coronavirus even existed.

One good thing nobody locking though business gone 10% pre-pandemic levels. friends business states they're 60-90%. guess good live state full dumbasses. go get infected keep economy running 1% population actually brain stays home.

The worst part it? I'm even smart. average american probably 2.6 comorbitities. point? *Sighs*, lost lot respect period. still overall positive perception, trying time. come say wear mask public knows actually started. took Bill Burr episode start thinking ""he must trolling, wants Bill go glorious rant"" confirmed trolling Bill later episode.

And justify period lot misleading ""science"" there. Poorly conducted studies, anecdotal evidence touted fact, hypotheses touted fact, etc. appreciate picked thought made sense told everyone way go. vetted waited see could actually proven.  think Mark lot people die covid covid keep numbers up. family members Friends people lives die get Marked covid despite symptoms death. even fighting hospital this.

I'd like point Singapore great example. huge transmissions numbers, hundreds everyday months outbreak foreign workers dormitory, government stepped handled it, making sure every foreign worker tested quarantined properly. now, weeks since mass testing ended foreign workers, single digits everyday local transmission cases, fact 1 2 per day average past week.

One thing government right mask mandate, note country way packed compared US even NZ. Hundreds thousands people take public transport everyday, packed like sardines peak hours, yet well placed social distancing measures effort everyone wearing masks, able overcome it.

Those wear mask public severe punishments, 1st time $300 fine, 2nd time $1000 fine 3rd time, get charged go straight court. foreigner, student working adult, deported never allowed back here. think president rallys. Now, look. left-wing get, actually understand ""open everything up"" argument. Coronavirus started 1 person China now, infected 100 million people. mean, inevitable everyone planet going catch eventually? argument whether okay letting people die sooner tiny bit later. reality?

Link number people seem think pandemic simply talk think terrifying. family went cautious May, thinking level precaution crazy. even know treat ""pandemic fatigue "" anymore.

SARS1 terrible comparison never became truly endemic population. Additionally, one reasons SARS1 vaccine development stalled due antibody dependant immune enhancement (ACE) wherein immune response viral challenge receiving vaccine caused severe side effects - different initial trials various SARS-COV2 vaccines seeing.

The point I'm trying make virus firmly rooted global population. Neither vaccine herd immunity going make go away. Either things reduce transmission disease severity, eradication pretty much table. especially true US sizeable portions population unlikely willingly receive successful vaccine. Couple immunosenesence viral genetic drift people certainly reinfected. point question pressing rate immunity lost - months, years, decades? virus new simply early make absolute statements top thread. Infinity. People choosing believe anything ‚Äúofficial‚Äù happens support beliefs.

Those us truly trying stay informed behave safe responsible manner little trouble separating accurate information reliable sources nonsense spouted everyone social media White House.

New Zealand China: joke you? doterra essential oil rep totally told thing. ah bees bad wasps though fuck things. similar experience. followed this:

If deaths made either real people died cause fake people. fake people, Social Security administration Social Security Number counted U.S. statistics. SSA must providing fake SSN. SSA Trump appointed head SSA. Trump lying American people?

Otherwise real people died something else. 290,000 deaths far year last year sources (not covid) either 290,000 people died reason died covid. 


Nobody ever replied argument keep using situation. robbing others foot people's bills acceptable charity isn't? angry tortoise even catch coronavirus That's Galidesivir might come in... ever finish trials Brazil. island nothing it. travel countries done planes. countries land-borders .. travel takes place roads thru border control checkpoints.

as 5 million - agree that's important - let's also remember average US state size 6 million, state large degree autonomy manages pox. Another interesting calculation many lives save distancing best case. assume save every single 400,000 covid death US since everyone distances perfectly, means individual 330M individuals US saves approximately 400,000 / 330,000,000 * (7.26 actuarial life years left median 82 yr old covid death) = 2.5 life days saved average. alternatively save 2.5 life days donating less $1 malaria foundation, save entire life donating $3500.  state worried pushing 4% weekend.. feel like stopped coming sub lot comments grim.

When someone dies test them, positive died COVID?

Actually, we're going partial lockdown,' said concerned Rutte. get virus control again, drastically reduce number social contacts travel movements. That's hard message, measures also hurt. way. facts lie. strict stricter behavior.

The cabinet therefore taking series measures combat rapid rise number infections. measures take effect Wednesday evening 10 p.m. According Rutte, 'we mainly looked measures reduce social traffic, without compromising crucial social sectors'.

First all, cafes restaurants close again. tough one, can't get around it,' says Rutte. number clusters infections hospitality industry relatively limited, 'but immediately involves large groups lots contact moments. still pick food. Hotels stay open serve food drinks guests'.

For stores outlets ban sale alcohol eight o'clock evening, 'to prevent pub moving street'. also ban drinking alcohol public places alcohol eight o'clock evening.

The group size goes maximum thirty people per room indoor spaces people sit. Wednesday onwards longer exemptions specific concert halls theaters. Exceptions churches, demonstrations democratic bodies Lower House. Exceptions also made work situations.

For groups maximum size four people inside outside belong one household. Children age 13 excluded. 'will maintain extra', said Rutte. Four four, discussion.

Behind front door already urgent advice maximum three guests per household. cabinet adding rule maximum one group per day. celebrate birthday new guests every hour. block birthdays'.

Group sports four people banned, like contact sports. Individual sports remain possible, even gym. Children young people age 18 may continue play sports team, competitions shut order limit travel movements reduce number contacts. public also remain prohibited amateur professional sports. Professional soccer thus 'continue current footing'.

Events banned. broad. outdoor concerts neighborhood barbecues theater festivals fairs'. stores line buying evenings. Also, stores must close eight o'clock evening, rule apply supermarkets. also strict maximum number customers per store. see spot things going well all, getting crowded, example, store closed immediately.

Then facemasks. order 'settle protracted discussion all', non-medical mouthpieces become compulsory 'anyone age thirteen moving around public indoor space', stores, museums theaters. obligation also apply education secondary school onwards, moving classes lectures. mouthpiece obligation legally laid down, urgent advice apply.

It's us,' concluded Rutte. stubborn person looks edges rules. realistic Dutchman stands takes responsibility comes it. that's now.

Would call New Zealand dumbasses well?  people paid this? Yeah, places lots people refused follow guidelines keep country reopened safely. Go mad them.

Also, 'second lockdown' areas facing less strict measures first, doubt rules stating one stay home 18 hours day. Winter Covid, yikes...

Perhaps mean people science based facts? I.E. ""Science says X, believe Not-X""? way harassing me, making shit up, carrying on, thought language love.

Why hypocritical harassment trolling? opening school tracks bikes. It'd boring plenty outside relatively safe. too, yikes... think people would consider relapse several weeks symptoms ‚Äúreinfection‚Äù even it‚Äôs strain. 

Well that's actually hallmark COVID-19, think counting reinfection really misguided. point get even you‚Äôve recovered. nobody‚Äôs keeping track that‚Äôs major hole epidemiology.

I know tracked, per se, stories pretty common. 14% cases past three weeks, 1/10 figure cover it.

If immunity tends wear time (and within range, day everybody, like bell curve), people would higher chance reinfection longer ago original infection was. 3 weeks lis likely waaay soon. cold-causing coronaviruses like 6 months+ people lose immunity. 

So talking initial wave march might lot reinfections now, that's covid. also much testing back many identified. 

Add together, expect many cases someone tested positive twice long time between. 

We simply know common/rare is, good idea changes time. Governor DeathSentence indeed: craven toadie. 

BTW: checked ‚Äî tours Governor‚Äôs Mansion still unavailable. Cases go back un-open risky businesses. best, suppression get open/close cycle steady half-open balance, immunity thing allow permanent opening. Yikes, sounds terrible... never said 2030. prediction late 2021 makes sense given take several months vaccine distributions occur nationwide. making argument perfect worth doing.

If post-vaccine IFR 1/10th pre-vaccine IFR getting vaccine least amount infections deaths saves hundreds thousands lives, even though perfect. Yes look image shows person 100% safe wrong. measurements hurt help surprised  health executive told council members additional pressure exerted patient transfers rural areas people wearing masks ""are laughed at,"" according Oklahoman.  end almost everyone dies flu. maybe side effect way better think right now. familiar method, looking something ever formally trained on. reading it. different levels lockdown mode, lockdown lot businesses closed. Yea, it‚Äôs crazy. New numbers released hour don‚Äôt see slowing time soon. We‚Äôll see Macron say tomorrow evening...

One good thing easy get tested, least me. got plane yesterday, waited 30 seconds, gave information needed, got tested got email 8 hours later, 1 morning, saying tested negative. Last couple days prominent European sportsmen tested positive; Ronaldo, Adam Yates Steven Kruijswijk stated felt discomfort ""regular symptoms"" covid-19.

First, probably say ""bubbles"" airtight. real issue here, symptoms, people contagious? researched? Yes. confusion. people can‚Äôt read graphs though. sudden quarter million deaths extra, compared last year? death toll monstrous trying sweep away. Trump pull USA WHO? No. people ounce damned sense would eradicated STIs now.  too. also vocal possible long-term effects, downvoted oblivion. evidence said, rare cases said. Next line reinfections short term immunity, any. Yeah whole summer memes Americans plague let in. hated American thinking stupid get nation cause every time logged Reddit, HUGE circlejerk. realized Trump what‚Äôs excuse I‚Äôve trying, damn hard, truth I‚Äôm much piece shit. equipment, knowledge, space solid body weight workout. matter much preworkout eat don‚Äôt energy make happen, suck.

I used work literally 10-15hrs week. worked like job. Weights, cardio, core, yoga bunch prehab/rehab back shoulders. consider win manage make 2 yoga sessions timeframe. top everything feels awful stuck heavy exhausting. I‚Äôll get half set pull-ups brain saying ‚Äúyou suck st lazy shit‚Äù body weight doubles fall ground. winter damn near plate added weight 4x6.

I either lie bed eyes closed 2hrs fall asleep, fall asleep dinner time I‚Äôm tired even hold head up. eat much forget eat 8pm.

And amount therapy antidepressants self abuse trying avoid self abuse seems fix it.

This year broken resolve literally every aspect life. don‚Äôt even excuse I‚Äôm still healthy employed (somehow). meant ""a tenth"" 0.27% initial 2.7%. check math yourself.

I'm sure mean genetic sequencing. ordinary tests work confirm reinfection? Someone gets it, get better, several weeks last symptoms disappear get again. understand it, primary test used looks active COVID presence, antibodies. Here's ""roadmap"" measures change four different levels severity lockdown, right dutch : [http://content10c3a.omroep.nl/urishieldv2/l27m498770be584d0bec005f85ea1f000000.38b97aaa01fffdecda71847b2274d5e5/nos/docs/routekaart.pdf](http://content10c3a.omroep.nl/urishieldv2/l27m498770be584d0bec005f85ea1f000000.38b97aaa01fffdecda71847b2274d5e5/nos/docs/routekaart.pdf)

I sure bit update english versions government websites well - This. fact matter is, businesses hit fiscal end-of-year. time bean counter accountants run numbers figure worked year didn't, costs cut next year.

Every single company run number cost office space, electricity, water potential decline productivity since instating WFH. cost buildings decline productivity cost, we're see ton empty buildings perma-WFH next summer, guaranteed. hole cheese Christ's sake! Merde hein!   forget porcine avian resivors math correct current IFR COVID, would get anywhere close 50milion deaths even 100% people infected. exactly mean. amazing people sub read synthesize information completely differently intended. call everyone else idiots. teacher definitely worried weeks Thanksgiving Christmas everyone ignores CDC gets together anyway  work O&amp;G LOPA shit everything

LOL, here. many crazy scenarios. Might way confirmation gets blocked, tbh Indoors trapping spewed germs people heavily breathing in. Comparing island nation population less 5 million people United States laughable. New Zealand model eradication would simply work countries around world. 

The virus may ‚Äúgone‚Äù now, happens cases pop up? Right back lockdown. think rest world afford lockdown off? entire system would collapse. Imagine vaccine wasn‚Äôt possible.. many people would support new normal permanently? Conversely, I'm sure, far the... metrics bacteria go, plants also grown soil, combination millions years natures' rot excrement. say kale left-upon bird dropping, mole die surface?

Cheese bad, thing matters safe eat. wash, cure, cook make :)

And, saying anything negative, pointing out, eastern world, mentioned cheese far less common west, may less familiar odd. think good contrast probably fermented foods present eastern world compared best. Cheese, yogurt, kefir, etc, spoiled milk, fermented food like beans, eggs, cabbage, rotten way, like cheese is. can't even get folks try tofu.

It's probably exposed to. Honestly, government mostly fault. Inconsistent advice, contradictory statements effectiveness masks, etc. led large gathering rather mentally challenged people jump ""it's hoax/not worse flu"" bandwagon.

Government holding press conference vehemently claiming nothing wrong. say late, inconsistent, implement measures soft. would say you. 
All world's leaders praying miracle. touting like foregone conclusion. 
Human nature is, lockdown- fatigue set majorly across board well compassion-fatigue.

Trump consistently vocal beliefs throughout whole thing assure you, less influence world-politics believe. 

It seems symptom American exceptionalism. country greater influence culture on, product near monopoly English speaking media politics it.

I'll say again, nobody western world wants Trump charge think we're taking lead problems enforcing guidelines result him, wrong. People people unfortunate people wont wait forever get back ""normal"". every world leader hoping thing Trump economy quell social unrest brewing over. 

I think we're gonna go around circles I'll say this, mean nicest way possible. 
Americans need realise they're special. view, dont many things first world countries take granted despite means it. idea America Americans different others. harmful, regressive recent events laughable. 

I realise must coming rude because, said, favourite people Americans get little heated. reason think good analogue? reason apparently researchers overlooked? source tells enough virus dies minutes infectious? far know information exists.  work care home Norrbotten nurse told us none eight patients receive hospital care covid-19 confirmed. Fortunately managed keep virus outside walls. idea chain command looked like. pretty bad! upset nursing home let grandma day go reunion. I'm definitely keeping distance. We'll merry Christmas cats :)  It‚Äôs even lockdowns, can‚Äôt play together safely live indoors anyway. Young people making biggest sacrifice (as generally social) smallest risk. 

Obviously would care least. sufficient supply warm, dry, affordable housing.

Competition two companies run 99.6% supermarkets.

A good sense correctly pronounce vowels. sub: 'Lockdowns cause harm used virus control.'

Expert: 'Lockdowns cause harm used virus control.'

Smug redditor: 'Lockdowns cause harm ~~and used virus control.~~' sub listen experts. NY Phil actually performed Spanish Flu!! guys badasses back day. Actually said. said late resort, been.  putting mask doesn‚Äôt equal lockdown. Love loathe him, one match Winston Peters' quick wit. Based packed Atlanta pride clubs past weekend, it‚Äôs sadly EVERYONE right wing. 50 million / 1.8 billion population 2.8% population. 

Covid killed 1 million population 7.8 billion, 0.1%.

Not trying downplay covid 1 million significant amount deaths, comparing Spanish Flu laughable. 5 people died: ""fake virus, liberal Hoax""  use Swiss cheese mask? People run outside right now. Even rain. use garage.  Find outlet anger, isn‚Äôt dark. Everyone‚Äôs life upended. sorry, truly. isn‚Äôt fair deserve formative years. However, aside billionaires, we‚Äôre giving things right now. sure follow.

Current policy isolate 10/14 days ID'd close contact. False negatives would cause infectious people world would otherwise isolated. first sentence mix r/circlejerk r/iamverysmart. True r/redditmoment NO!!!! think people 99.9% chance dying Covid-19? Same. Bowel lockdown. can‚Äôt even poop girlfriend (for 6 years) anywhere near. control pandemics good economy, either. 

You setting false dichotomy. Ah yes, everything ""AmErIcA PrOpAgAnDa"". Let's follow global times lmao. COVID deniers like ‚Äúbut move around make holes tho‚Äù store lets employees wear masks wear face shield ü§™ still poor soul wiping cart handles though. plexiglass registers isn‚Äôt even customer cashier. feeling mandating ‚Äòlet go‚Äô employee gets covid too. certainly haven‚Äôt told us mandatory unpaid leave ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Door door? expect? Even conservative scientists B***n camp say May completely behind us.

With long period getting better vaccine EUAs happen. gravity situation proved impact january 1st, 2022, pandemic over, i'll look deaths per capita make judgement. anything guesswork based seems working.

but serious question... obviously... know even pretend neutral party here. state think sweden handled well call everyone else unthinking toads. there's need smoke mirrors. ""He really listens people brings afraid bring differing views!""

No, gives shitty people platform, nods along whatever last thing heard giving half-ass non-responses, trying harder sound informed actually challenging views. see edited comment? changed original made sense... hence suggestion longer does. Yeah forgot quotes 

""Lockdowns one consequence must never ever belittle, making poor people awful lot poorer""


""Just look what's happened tourism industry Caribbean, example, Pacific people taking holidays,"" said.

""Look what's happened smallholder farmers world ... Look what's happening poverty levels. seems may well doubling world poverty next year. may well least doubling child malnutrition.""

The article headline tame compared headlines tbh. I'll help look meds. know %s work? Huh say disagree, sounds like agree money, spin class?

Also running/hiking always free require space.

I bought foldable bike 40 facebook, riding home hour day. That's 2 spinco classes. feel minor sacrifice help reduce spread make life easier people

As pandemic made clear, many people like personal inconvenience matter small unless benefits directly. could never comprehend personal inconvenience help others. I'm sorry junior high science class colossal failure you. anyone even pay attention guys point? know stopped. bingo fun beginning virus spread feels like every country went whatever wanted however wanted. already said lockdown important economy

No, consistent they've said before. Read Dr. Nabarro clearly saying here. Lockdowns necessary tool to: "" buy time reorganize, regroup, rebalance resources, protect health workers exhausted, large, we‚Äôd rather it.""

A lockdown ""the primary means control virus."" saying thing beginning. primary means control virus must national public health IPC controls involving high levels testing contact tracing, along adequate surge medical capability respond large outbreaks. Region country-wide lockdowns (aka shelter place) primary means control outbreaks. used signal primary means control effectively place. originally told people wearing masks ineffective

During global PPE shortage beginning pandemic, extent asymptomatic transmission understood, recommend everyone wear mask times. WHO, point, said masks ineffective. easily disproven myth. go look mask guidance early on. advised general public wearing masks reserve PPE healthcare workers caring sick outside medical contexts. course masks effective. That's recommended symptoms taking care people symptoms. clear later effectiveness cloth masks. surprisingly little evidence effectiveness relatively recently. gone back forth several times COVID-19 transmitted

Such nature novel virus. known buckle economic pressure US China give bad advice

For pressure US China, member states, tries put evidence giving bad advice pandemic wishes state. lockdowns incredibly effective far suspect work exceptionally well. Nothing particularly surprising would awesome byproduct COVID/the awful year 2020 us seasonal flu bread existence speak. Literally everyone? That's possible happen NZ China. using exact type fallacy article arguing against. Finally, sensible comment I‚Äôve looking time üëè exactly says tell excess deaths coming from? 1.) Check time line comparison. Spinish Flu 2+ year deal.

2.) take drastic lock measures slow transmission SF CV. Australia well, trust quarantine would suspect completely vaccinate population, call done, open borders, accepting yes, coronavirus pop occasionally. zombie apocalypse memes make sense. mean sound pretty alarmist now. think it‚Äôs time break whatever strange crusade you‚Äôre on? 

I‚Äôm signing strange crusade day, best luck there. Send us resume want impress us way.

In meantime I'll judge write here, pretty darn stupid. last flu pandemic prior 2009's Swine Flu killed 100,000 Americans? 

Where sourcing this? seeing [estimate 8,868 18,306 estimate *still* ways get exercise CDC (RIVM) keeps saying good scientific evidence effectiveness masks.. keep saying need several 100k people wear masks save life 1 person.

Now decision taken political level. political pressure clear made government decide they're mandatory. CDC still says lack evidence effictiveness. know 200k plus died far less 8 months, totally never knew amirite /s Nefarious plot? Misdiagnosis conspiracy now?

Be honest bud. belief want believe defending comical degree. lockdowns? We're locked down... Masks, social distancing, hand-washing. Easy. completely get rid it, drastically reduce spread simple things still allow activities go on. wearing mask risk following science. Right? except bars restaurants everything open still calling lockdown? ""partial"" part guess, interesting. rarely went restaurants almost never bars before, guess lockdown entire life. Well, technically pedantic, scale used Earth, single country. think time period would longer 10 days personally, everyone world quarantined month technically would go away, realistic. Mate, I'm Canadian I'm familiar socialized healthcare. definitely think reopen... US, would favour massive reopenings, though that's really prerogative non-citizen. BBC AJ manufacturing consent US. It‚Äôs journalism made US go war Spain German early 20th century. fully understand Occams razor. hypothesis response pandemic changing mortality patterns far palatable nefarious plot under-report COVID deaths factor almost double. People dying population increasing, aging getting less healthy. Add stress, despair lack access preventative healthcare seems entirely reasonable that's excess mortality coming from.

I'm happy listen studies post-mortems people died COVID-like symptoms without COVID listed cause death turns it. Link? idea talking about.

It's difficult tell difference evidenced fact can't cite single post mine untrue alarmist. intentionally choosing ignore difference order downplay deadly infectious disease.  Yeah bad plan, nutrition bad definitely tell social skills deteriorated greatly. Afraid safe go outside I'll start talking people like talk cats, lol.

Cheers, thanks suggestion. makes rare? opposite, happen all?  locking cases also ruins economy though, people want spend money see number cases rising. 

But say, I'm Thailand, lockdown might way go Western worlds. Taiwan export dependent? people talked probably joe Rogan fans two months ago got fed liberals cult psychotic fucks said one thing turned lol. What‚Äôs new? Besides cancel culture. aren‚Äôt throwing molotovs buildings aren‚Äôt ‚Äúwoke‚Äù enough. Hopefully outliers. think long term immunity well-established original (sars-cov) disease, encouraging. place, name lease? There's one way make leave. Pretty tame. Feels like stuff you‚Äôd 4000 cases week, 4000 cases day lol looks like restrictions MI stand anyway, issued differently already corrected that. screws people unemployment tried help people extending legislative decision Michigan. They've also less 5 deaths day since end July. deaths came able get everything control, difference. America never got anything control. They've less 40 people die past month. We've 30,000. similar article California. 
It mentions rate 23 mutations per year. so, someone explain worried effectiveness vaccines?
I‚Äôm health professional, I‚Äôve always understood vaccine uses mechanism protects body naturally reinfections. naturally get reinfected, would vaccine protect Fuck. hope stay away rest year. That's pure criminal negligence, least. Visiting cancer patient? Jesus Christ. Got pretty close close borders short-term visitors foreign labourers

Only residents allowed travel Singapore. Annnnnd don‚Äôt care Close enough.

Let's count alive mental health problems... agree doubters: could somebody old, fat, kind co-morbidity (remember secret trip hospital supposedly something physical) get covid suddenly within less week discovery perfectly well. SS guys riding joyride get infected? magical. Maybe test vaccine delivered via nose spray never got Covid all. Trump vector-another patsy is. Everyone close nondisclosure agreement...just sayin' trouble.‚Äô

Sounds like waving red-cloak front bull. 22 US troops tested positive, bringing total infected troops stationed SK 225. Source? gov.'s official numbers. says 62.324 last 7 days cases oct. 12th, 14.969 Madrid.

Esp√©rate despu√©s de Navidad, cuando todo el mundo haya pasado por el forro lo de las reuniones familiares. Los pol√≠ticos son penosos, pero hay mucha agente irresponsable tambi√©n. That‚Äôs actually entirely true (I think, can‚Äôt read mind).

1) Yes, PPE supplies strained. goal net benefit safer, via protected caregivers. Spanish Flu case study greater loss life due loss caregivers.

2) PPE actually harmful (here come votes). Let‚Äôs use condoms example: worn properly, drastically diminish risk STIs unwanted pregnancy. Used improperly, actually could raise risks. Plenty research there, holds true masks gloves.

3) False sense security. early days pandemic (perhaps even now), underestimated virulent virus was. Masks represented (and still do) false sense security. assumed primary vectors close contact maybe fomites, similar influenza. parameters, aerosols chief concern, masks seen false shield might inverse effect increase close contact. people seem think company like J&amp;J Pfizer's interest release unsafe vaccine win race, whereas imagine actual stock price impact actually hundreds people presenting severe adverse effects two months out? would ruin management's reputation overnight too, reasoning makes sense unless pharma execs desperately want get fired months stock options turn worthless. say 14 30% different areas (automatic translation horrible, actually originally English Iranians abroad translate guy Twitter whole thread note general Iranian government suppressing stats systematically beginning. opposition abroad claims real death tolls 120,000, official 28,000, actually makes lot sense -- 120,000 scaled population would still bad got New York, New York bad stretch three months things quiet there, Iran three waves now, never got cases substantially those. 

So Iranian government sources would expected hiding reinfections too, looks like extent, also talking lot. Iranians abroad also talking about. sources agree, ideological reason to, taken seriously. 

Again, Iran unique -- place much spread long. Brazil, Peru, Mexico, etc. 4-5 months behind. Iran first place expect see strong evidence reinfections, couple months everyone else. Unfortunately, also tough get reliable information there, again, given stake, one take reports extremely seriously. (ANSA) - ROME, OCT 13 - Premier Giuseppe Conte's government passed decree overnight imposing new restrictions aimed combatting spread COVID-19.

Truly great move!

But even .03% 3 hundredths percentage point higher. That‚Äôs bad. 

Remember worst case scenario March/April 2.2 Million deaths. basically 1/10th that. Well done!

Let's trace chain emails!   It‚Äôs different. Antigen way prone pop false negative Wtf? antigen testing PCR. Antigen negatives almost accurate coin flip! wrong 50% time. fact didn‚Äôt announce he‚Äôs tested negative PCR (still accurate terms negatives better...) means probably  Yeah, don‚Äôt know yet. hopeful we‚Äôd know serious issues worse second infections though. However, ~70% asymptomatic cases, leaves open chance reinfections missed.

To original point though, medicine doesn‚Äôt work present ‚Äúscientific evidence‚Äù much established scientific evidence. reason clinician would diagnose negative covid test individual, presumed positive. It‚Äôs whole picture medicine, presentation, exposure, etc. one data point like diagnostic. realized alot people commenting actually read whole article reacted reading headline. headline click baity keep seeing people talk us ""wave 3"" I'm like... fuck? lol Wave 1 never even ended due rampant stupidity. aware rapid antigen negatives approximately equivalent coin flip, right? false negative rate 50%, antigen tests anyone depend negative. fact didn‚Äôt advertise far wide tested negative PCR test (‚Äúgold standard‚Äù still 70% accurate regards negative, depending test) means probably test negative PCR. It‚Äôs white house it‚Äôs like cost issue. Grim. blame lack testing infrastructure, complete lack clear messaging top government.

It's 6 months. actually expect people lost immunity within period, expect happen year so. 

That picking outliers distribution actually significant.

Then Iran, government reporting lot hospitalized reinfections third wave (in one recent public statement Iranian official claimed 20-30% current cases reinfections), also extremely significant Iran got hit hard two months earlier Europe US (they hid completely month, already ton cases January). 

We see right within next 6 months. 

But afraid go another example abominable failure basic risk management situation strongly asymmetric possible outcomes. Exactly may indirect - probably are, fair chunk due reporting.  Basically half America dont think apparantly know age structure population, mortality rates things kill people (for example car crashes) pretty good idea many people expect see die given period time.

By 250-300K excess deaths we're saying 250-300K people died far year would otherwise expected - called excess deaths. 

Since official death count covid-19 ~210K additional 40-90K unaccounted - may either under-reported direct deaths deaths caused secondary condition (e.g. afraid go hospital want catch virus really needed to) 

As another example remember years back Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico reported 64 deaths. Months later looked death data found ~1400 excess deaths. likely counted others secondary - example lack power access hospitals. deaths caused hurricane - kind of. They'd alive otherwise storm surge high winds kill them. Republicans claim pandemic nonsense 260,000+ American Deaths never happened. Give never mentioned returned negative PCR test still using rapid test kits they've using along......I'd say always chance still could infectious People per square mile means nothing population lives towns cities. matter much empty area add state, epidemic dynamics determined places people actually live.

It's like saying Denmark handle coronavirus better area includes Greenland. obviously work like that. Basically using rapid tests using White House along...and know well worked rose garden. Interesting return negative PCR test..they totally would said so. PCR gold standard tests. 5 people died: ""reee Demo bad! could Hillary done this""

220000 people died: ""fake virus, liberal Hoax"" enough transmit humans? Well, yeah. There's work actors willing fake childrens' deaths countries, too. Dems perfectly willing spend $billions fake crisis actors even got Deep State every country world.

We hope - got remember far fewer people get flu shots. 

Most people get flu shots work (which they're going into), others understandably reluctant go doctors office pharmacy flu shot. Triple digit 33 imported cases.

You may interested learn something called [Dunbar's essence cranial capacity limits number active social connections 150 following 'tiers'

* 5 inner circle - family live with, close friends ect..

* 10 secondary level - Best friends &amp; people see often

* 40 third tier - friends acquaintances 

* 100 people whose names know faces recognize 


So take 225,000 deaths X 150 = 33,750,000 million know someone whose dies (about 10% population)

Reduce whole bunch deaths cluster (as virus transmitted across social networks) thus duplication (e.g know 1 person whose died likely know multiple people died.) Australia even limiting amount citizens returning country (a hundred day). imagine immigration open Americans sadly.

Try stay safe buddy, we'll welcome open arms over. also skeptic makes sense

Skeptics always believe cryotherapy. That's know skeptic. Fear Factor pretty legit.  US seem better France testing.

\*Uh Oh\*

Ya got one reply actually make point mindlessly parrot conspiracy tropes. Cool. Means 1.5% public health professionals, law enforcement, clinicians, etc. too. Thanks explaining factors. pay prison cell food work would pay it? I'm sure virus reason weaken significantly time. 

Not yet. quite likely happen that:

1. Vaccination becomes widespread; 
2. People develop immune memory, fades variable rate.

If aggressive Covid breaks area people's immunity first vaccination fades, we'll launch booster programmes. eventually, variant evolve causes common cold, one gets tested one gets pneumonia, becomes dominant variant globally. 

Of course, there's guarantee happen, vaccine could create kind evolutionary pressure longer period ‚Äî we're unlikely talking months, here. get perspective sure(and part felt betrayed well), also understand decision since virus fairly new time. knew health workers fall(or mass walk quit), damage civilians. honest population, would panicked. 

 Overall mentioned good idea probably would helped curb spread(for good civilians WOULD make masks), think end would run competition issues PPE. 

 see encouraging people make home made masks, people see contradiction(don't buy masks make = people need masks Fauci underplaying = I'm going buy masks anyway fast runs others figure make masks, sell $$ etc). think end result would same.

It's tough situation in, goes back civilians react situations(not civilians course). 

 believe Fauci's decision made save lives profit political gain. saying Scientists saints, feel healthcare workers Scientists overall working hard moment help us species(While governments absolute opposite) . sure? says 'Discontinued' marketing status, searching tritec fda site gives documents older one asking for/ordering retraction ranitidine variants. I've seen happen medicare physical therapy. nursing homes give new admit (or readmission hospital) absolute cadillac treatment. Get walking feeling good, lots attention 90 days. reach 'max potential' - day 90, medicare benefits end. happened over.

So much stretch, especially people listen bottom feeders like Jones, believe unscrupulous doctors might padding numbers. 

Almost us dealt confusing bills, medical professionals listen. children ex husband come close dying medical neglect. son disabled life doctor test strep. Later got Lyme, almost bedridden found doctor would listen. told anxiety implied crazy. 

I understand people trust medical profession. still do, point. We're anti vax, kids see allopathic doctors. experiences past 20 years, time working healthcare, made little skeptical. I've seen many doctors give shit. comparison very, flawed.

You're really comparing amount benefit people received near feudal country's economic growth industrial country amount benefit highly developed industrialized country received?

You must joking.

Yeah China massively grew bottom acceptable livable level people.

In time, things went downhill people western countries. I'm talking fucking Trump rhetoric. I'm talking wealth GDP increase going 1%, like Trump. I'm talking houses becoming unaffordable, I'm talking student loans ruining life. use like that. growth steady, went 1% entirely. suprised? see cops, little percent wearing masks... Meanwhile, Vietnam, New Zealand etc ... think one thing might stop you. Life What‚Äôs truly wild Wisconsin basically sued reason.  Wisconsin‚Äôs Supreme Court upheld restrictions. 

This whole response cluster. guys didn‚Äôt set facilities hybrid video/in-person proceedings? 4 imported cases though. Good they‚Äôre detected can‚Äôt let guard rest world control too. one happy elections (and government lost big time, directlt affect right now, senate) started acting. current situation almost measures needed. stupid ones though, importantly pushing students dormitories - anywhere else go, others pushed go infect parents ... overall first good move months. we're supposed see families anymore? grandparents 80's. they're good health knows many good years left. think want spend time isolated? seeing loved ones? think choice them. Seems like rather EVIL thing do. someone living Sweden, think lockdown anything it.
Generations cultures trusting government, following rules, social stigma don't, robust, egalitarian, Healthcare system, heavy focus high quality housing everyone, excellent internet infrastructure big sturdy social safety nets reason Sweden go without forced lockdown. It‚Äôs pretty rare, otherwise we‚Äôd seeing constantly places hitting second wave. happen it‚Äôs extremely unlikely proven otherwise. tell one two people 7 million. Vaccine testing takes time, whether Dear Leader want acknowledge it.

I realize social distancing bums out, get it.  lot unhealthy Americans Yeah he's afraid call people bullshit. agree lot policies either god can't fault man adding bit character NZ politics elections however many years he's MP. places cited still heavy restrictions things like bars, restaurants, crowd sizes, etc. lot people, especially sub every post r/COVID19_support teenagers early-20‚Äôs talk COVID ruining lives can‚Äôt go frat parties like older siblings whatever, ‚Äúliving it‚Äù means giving accepting mass outbreaks.

And frankly I‚Äôm sick irresponsibility. I‚Äôm sick governor going TV telling people go eat don‚Äôt restricting indoor dining despite us worst day pandemic day. I‚Äôm ‚Äúthis sub‚Äù dumb cretin... You‚Äôre right, trials working intended seems like tough week trends going wrong way taking words literally.

When setting policy that's going effect millions people, literal. second-guessing wiggle room policies US UK can't contain COVID. Anyway, I've run spoons discussion, good day. anti values sides political spectrum. 

Stupidity rely political affiliation Could be.

What virus mutates comes around big wave reinfecting 4 million lots folks. Uhh who's moving goal posts? literally can't calculate odds dying car accident without knowing much people drive. literally math.  Except gone.

And moment relax restrictions, comes right back. not? AstraZeneca trial halted precisely neurological issues. J&amp;J know about, release details.

But could ""safety concern"" monoclonal antibody autoimmunity? 

Of course, one would think would proteomic work exclude possibility, are.  hate tell this.

But that‚Äôs half America. lot people miles behind countries reason idea wealth education they‚Äôre eating scraps truly wealthy Americans titans industry.

The best Americans really keeping many things America afloat it‚Äôs getting crowded boat. idiots going sink arrogance stupidity.  one state? Yes yet proven COVId got early phase 2 results pretty quick- take years determine whether someone produced antibodies generated adaptive immune response. phase 2 continues long time continue monitor response well better develop safety profile. information necessarily needed justify trial measuring actual efficacy.

Political bellyaching? know noticed, million people already passed away, people genuinely suffering even dying NPIs we've instituted. things slowly apparently want happen, pandemic would likely ended time vaccine approved, killing hundreds thousands invalidating much need vaccine first place. hope see fruitlessness propose, we're designing medicine dead. always use fresh mask rosacea completely control. :( Lol knowing mom, id say probably correct New Zealand good Australia, Japan, vietanam too, Sud Corea. Search Google. Sources: Dude Trust me. Czechia, Romania, Bosnia surpassed US daily deaths per capita well.

EDIT: Also Moldova North Macedonia accidentally swallowed mask wanted take deep breath, gave indigestion. Five months ""lasting immunity""

Emergency Use Authorization. basically allows get fast tracked approval use without full testing completed. I'll bet mom taught bad santa thing two üòà China ban time?

It‚Äôs classic whataboutism strategy also plays racism/persecution complex. 
1) need hyperfocus China Bad take heat Trump/the Trump administration‚Äôs handling pandemic. 
2) fuels persecution complex like imagine everyone ignored ‚Äúgood thing‚Äù Trump ‚Äúracist,‚Äù ignoring ban a) basically ban INO b) banning travel China covid already verified multiple countries *was racist*. Humans inability analyze risk also assign morality pathogens really fucked us up. convo dude basically like, don‚Äôt get tested STDs wouldn‚Äôt sleep anyone gross enough one, like, yiiikes. You‚Äôre reason chlamydia skyrocketing dude. There's Orthodox, there's folks like Hasidic communities.

You find Orthodox groups worship pretty much nationwide US, really, really deeply communal folks around New York. (I married Conservative family NJ, around NYC, get familiar pretty much everybody Jewish)

Orthodox outside NYC area seem lot better keeping secular health protections, least ones I've seen traveling transit around Washington DC. Terrible reading comprehension. anything, doomsday crowd revels death finding ways spin good news. case, hospital/ deaths cratered upset coronabros.

Most situation cases people told surges OMG people dared go gatherings. surges almost never happen. GOOD thing.

Coronabros entitled opinion. I'm entitled facts empirical data.

Aviation safety works (again) something like can‚Äôt pass review ever again. stereotype based truth unfortunately. I‚Äôve lived around world different countries come across uneducated people America way often places. Historical facts numbers handled sloppily intellectual pursuits deemed snobby. curiosity rest world even pride rebel learning. example English language. least experience, Americans unapologetic incorrect grammar spelling (I talking correct American spelling, British) become defensive angry instead grateful learn something new improve on. People countries quick admit bad English even better Americans‚Äô. It‚Äôs like Americans take pride making mistakes ignorant. Pride skipping school tradition. don‚Äôt see countries. about... 7 months time now? 

Stupid excuses. Oof got me. Sweden really amazing job. Thank opening eyes. spring interesting time, scared shitless news coming China. 

So much new data considered threat already knew needed do, hunker stay down. Never mind lockdown based initial, flawed data.

We knew needed done, going let science get way. positive rate 1% anymore sadly. We've climbing well 1,6x% week two ago. might getting close 2% now.  55-year-old father diabetes, ICD, severe heart disease likely COVID-19. symptomatic past couple days, missed work get tested hours ago. gotten results quite yet, coworker tested positive. chances survival? Give straight. advice welcomed course.   All...how many them?

Immunity hit-or-miss individual level robust general. Trials paused safety reasons time. Less mean none, point. severe lactose intolerance even small amount lactose send spiraling pain diarrhea. can't even eat butter even trace amounts tear up. amount lactase helps. Finally completely eliminate dairy diet. Well, think us *wanted* end now. less want, realistically expect.

If expectations align somewhere along ballpark reality, pissy, least. taking words literally. Hypothetically true ten days, would gone. Obviously can't control four hundred million people like that. thing is, US never anywhere close that. whole post Swiss Cheese theory. holes it. would still massively cut new cases. three times two months, better results. 50 tests per second? 

Hahaha I've saying months......PELT CANDY WINDOW I'm sure he'll kick time! first metaphor isn‚Äôt complete dogshit! Nice.  reading wayyy hard said. meant choice political party something somehow alters outcome/choice make. I'm still hearing answers Mmmm, tasty.  establishments supposed keep recommendations distance, table service limiting crowds

Doesn't matter indoors there's constant exchange air. seen every single country restrictions now. Restaurants bars make 1/3rd cases, depending good contact tracing is. even need add clubs ontop notice terrible is.

The infections are, likely someone club X likely he'll infect tons people club.

So yes, everything social interactions growing problem virus numbers growing.

I'm happy Christian Drosten provides much better insight this. Dumb headline. article:

""The results study showed signs coronavirus directly attacks nervous system,"" says study lead investigator Jennifer Frontera, MD. ""The neurological complications seen COVID-19 predominately secondary effects severely ill suffering [low oxygen body prolonged periods time,"" says Frontera, professor Department Neurology NYU Langone Health.  sure trying conversation one native tongue struggling conversation incivility. feel like quite opposite. It‚Äôs test highly unreliable you‚Äôre asymptomatic: you‚Äôve contact someone, isolate. don‚Äôt *you* one people following rules need followed. got away major outbreak able shut borders countries something American states can't do.

I'm interested hear would work WalMart. We're talking US, right, tiny island middle Pacific? Tradition. something community serious life death, come say faces know so. rabbi literally making sure every person hears danger lips sees eyes understand.

That's Jewish thing, mind you. Christian priests deacons used small communities too, minister specifically sick still keep similar tradition people care. say Spring Summer. right US, 1 4million people experience reinfection. could underreported infections mild, know now, it‚Äôs rare. I'm saying need consider both. considering science transmission, making decisions solely feelings mental health wrong/reckless approach. Seems like one making hysterical alarmist statements here. never said anything like panicking.

So, sum, unable cite anything Ive said alarmist untrue. Got it. So, we're going reach immune failure order try explain happens vast majority people? That's reach. 

The vast majority second cases chickenpox caused reinfection due immune failure reactivation virus. Even paper cited (which evidence actually presented) show actual reinfection 33% cases known exposure event second symptoms. distinguish reactivation true reinfection paper just, like said previously, clinical presentation pox rashes. Immunologically, make sense call ""reinfection"" person immune failure (in case, generating lower avidity abs IgG3 rather IgG1 subclass), far likely person would reactivate already exists within them. Again, virus leave person reactivate. sequencing done samples whatsoever, impossible know true reinfections, unlike case SARS-CoV-2, reinfections determined clinical symptoms, actually sequencing virus show two dissimilar viruses. provides hope covid regarding reinfections cases we're seeing may also part something anomaly norm.

None remotely related coronavirus (re)infections. each. shown coronaviruses immunity short lived homologous reinfections possible.  currently way proving homologous reinfection SARS-CoV-2, but, clinically, plenty cases ""relapse"" patients tested negative test positive later date. virus sequence sufficiently similar, there's way proving true reinfection relapse false negative test. Took two seconds find factually wrong statement whatever garbage post was. Throw bacon them. That‚Äôll show them. 

Or better yet, middle night, fill whole synagogue every pork product possible. 

That‚Äôs probably way stop it. next summer? please don‚Äôt say ‚Äúbecause Fauci said so.‚Äù know said this. said lot things. real hope give people next summer end date? Funnily enough, that's N95 masks work. People complain gaps fibers larger virus, forgetting tons layers.

That west keep lying China censoring everything disappearing anyone voice out?

That western media reposting positive news China always throw ""but one knows true chinese state media can't report negative news"".

But reporting negative news China they're quoting chinese state media can't report negative news directly? Wow, 25 9/11s dead Americans completely *forgotten* about. Incredible. feel like degree statistical fuckery worse anything China cooked up. I'm doused sanitizer purge toxins 85% vaccines reach phase 3 do. enroll 30000 people trial something weird bound happen. right surprising, mean going take years produce this.

You guys want changed fit narrative IIRC CanSino. None true. I‚Äôm Bay Area ate INDOORS restaurant, got hair cut INSIDE worked gym INDOORS. 

Newsom didn‚Äôt kill businesses, virus (and irresponsible behavior beginning wearing masks listening common sense guidelines) did. Untrue. Many thousands lives *already* saved buying time spring summer develop better treatments, thus reducing mortality rate among recently infected.

Assuming viable vaccine delayed years, delaying spread end completely preventing many infections, deaths, permanent disabilities.

I‚Äôm upset title considering one narrative, many reasons excess deaths. fact is, people look death certificates death numbers. Many death causes aren‚Äôt even respiratory. Yes small fraction respiratory ones may COVID, early days testing. That‚Äôs extremely unlikely summer went testing everywhere. Woolf says deaths indirectly caused pandemic camefrom illnesses Alzheimer's disease, diabetes heart disease, sharply increased five states recorded COVID-19 deaths. Delayed care, fear seeking care emotional crises stemming pandemic could also contributed deaths, says, well inaccurate death certificates may misidentified COVID-19 death.

They endangering lives. Thats accurate either. think portion excess likely covid deaths reported covid, others likely indirectly caused things mentioned. think that's herd immunity folk proposing though. They're saying allow young (under 45) live lives normal risk low (virtually zero) keep economy ticking along, alongside protect vulnerable, old sick isolation method.

I still haven't. exactly approach computer information security. works nothing perfect even adequate own, many halfway decent approaches together make big impact. [It‚Äôs going away: need real, non-political debate best way live COVID countries article ridiculous. even debate public policy without using politics? Nobody says 'political' dentist says brush teeth regularly avoid tooth decay, drive drunk might harm others, obey traffic lights reason.

It sounds like article assuming 'best way live COVID' continue uncontrolled spread pretending exist, unless indefinitely confine vulnerable people house arrest foreseeable future. Pretty terrible idea, especially since already countries demonstrated possible live COVID also keeping illness contained.

In news, go away weather warms up. disappear, like miracle. stick around denial want... virus give shit. Sorry. true theory. honestly I'd rather someone pull fingernails put life hold three months study another bar exam, wait another three months results. No... fucking... thank you. genuinely appreciate sort thing. someone wipes cart minimizes contamination touching random things don‚Äôt need (like carts) seeing places sanitize carts puts ease. course understand still need touch refrigerator handles products likely shelved employees handling surfaces. feel like every bit helps. Yeah think too, mom pretty selfish. She‚Äôs opportunities come see baby chosen shopping first acted shocked can‚Äôt see afterward he‚Äôs gone bed said would. It‚Äôs bad thing guess bit disappointing. 

Yeah it‚Äôs crazy. remember reading covid hospital baby born thinking, ‚Äúit‚Äôs gonna long it‚Äôs here.‚Äù Took two months lockdown. time baby! gonna come babies gonna many people get know! n=1 sample size. Can't really draw conclusion way. Probably given latest/greatest cutting edge cocktail meds whatever else. Whatever wasnt cheap Mmmm cheese well non-science POV first diagnosis June . immediately went hospital quarantine 2weeks, rehab. became weaker even physical therapy hospital stay. released immediately problems strength, back rehab. moved full-time assisted living sept 8. caught covid went quarantine again. 

The thing could see cognitive capability diminished. could progression disease. ate swiss cheese saw pop got worried second maybe link something. I'm idiot damn anti-vaxxers rail against.

Ugh. 

A vaccine immeasurable help, there's always going chance still catch it, like flu. think showed COVID least three major different strains already, unless get vaccine three, there's still chance catch it, like inoculating wrong flu. 

And nothing fuck around with. get many people still think ""it's bad flu"". disease aftereffects nothing like it. I've both, I'd much prefer flu count maybe week two, COVID still affecting 6 months later. Oh no, one healthiest wealthiest athletes world got covid, ever get this. Currently reinfection rare

You can't even say certainty. simply know. might rare. virus hasn‚Äôt humans long takes time someone catch it, get tested, catch again, get tested again. Also, fact many places aren‚Äôt testing much makes spotting reinfections harder. Also everyone rightfully brings failure produce PPE health care workers visa restrictions creating doctor shortage. Russian bots busy today 'The people disagree perception reality confident become it', said sane person. Could care less family. probably ended infecting families (which actually take effort keep people safe) didnt believe exists, family suffering changes mind?? F that. bunch words for: number wrong I‚Äôm incorrectly citing CDC number haven‚Äôt officially come I‚Äôm everything make shit prove point, meanwhile I‚Äôm downplaying 300,000+ additional Americans died. Unfortunately going help anti-maskers understand situation better due Swiss Cheese Brain phenomenon. anyone know ‚Äú15 minutes‚Äù came from? People clinging words CDC ‚Äúguidelines‚Äù like ‚Äú6feet‚Äù like letter law. know 10 minutes safe 15 minutes crosses line? truth truth, aashole Let‚Äôs forget school aged children second highest group positivity precedes increases older population increases article. Stupid people everywhere. Even Canada. Go figure. U.S. Australia reasonably close obesity rates.

Yes bogan confers degree immunity. It‚Äôd story decade! century. sure helps you, testing 7-8 days recommendation small city (US). amount time allows virus build enough detectable. Close contacts positive cases (in case, parent positive children) would asked quarantine, wait 7-8 days, test. negative, would think person would still quarantine lives positive cases. 

No one else would tested close contact‚Äôs workplace asked quarantine, area. imagine vary based live company policies are. 

I hope remain virus-free.  Thanks clarification. basically quoting line play Angels America, mention Angel Moroni one gave tests Joseph, Mormons called Morons. governor hits head accident becomes mathematical genius?

I personally would like vaccinated. seeing china different countries. got skeptical vaccine quality Well, never thought that. yeah, make sense, least me. play vs France players test game youngster jersey swap Cristiano Ronaldo said would never neve wash it. might want wash now.

 write article messi fan sure think big problem years leased new cars, blew money. Saved zero retirement. sit apartment, bitter, hobbies. They're looking something angry at. say open everything up, asked couple days ago ""what herd immunity?""  minutes later asked, ""why would contact trace?""  they'll say wedding east responsible 8 deaths happened. Makes sense Gyms? Really? Right now? boost immune?

1) exercise 2) eating nutritional foods 3) vitamins supplements...

Whats messaging?

1) stay inside 2) order fucking delivery take fault mom pop stores close 3) Zinc kill you.


We Americans fat, unhealthy, unhygienic people.. bad compared others prevention efforts. Keep us fat, load us medication issues. Yep. confirmed. impossible reason people. tout whole ""only 6% covid deaths caused covid alone"" cuz understand comorbodity even is...and j explain leftist puppet haha hurt. read ago doctor happened recreational runner wearing several masks long jog prove discernible effect blood oxygen levels. year better position. know virus better treatments, also probably vaccine available. ""I'm staying six feet away, need mask"" come trump didnt use it?  Stop sending  think 2 fold. 

1. never liked texture meat. Growing up, mom felt meat essential healthy diet (understandable lived fucked times China witness community members starve death eating literal tree bark desperation.) made finish meat every meal. leave table did. hated meat growing up. made every mealtime home stressful negative thing. quickly associated eating negative emotions. Got point college medical school, stressed academics, I'd stop eating handle stress ""having"" force feed top study. Thankfully later life realized could go plant based still get micro macronutrients need. eating became enjoyable miserable chore. childhood + innate dislike certain textures set stage mindset eating/food = ugh. 


2. think repulsion dairy specifically came reading books food. forget book was, discovered mastitis (udder infections cows) pretty common, causes pus get milk. Since milk thousands cows combined giant tanks, pus contaminates milk even cows mastitis. eat it.


Of course food bacteria. practical kill remove bodies dead bacteria food still remotely affordable. would healthy. food feces it, too, improperly handled fertilizer, runoff problems, employees touching bathroom door handle someone else (who may washed hands) may used. eating pus felt draw line... because, come on. pus, dude. 


That got thinking often meat eat might pus it. Who's say every farm animal cyst time death? Ergo, might eaten pus. 


I've since made peace pus-eating make yogurt eat cheese occasionally. first half sentence sounds awful taken context. Don‚Äôt forget step BULLDOZE RIGHT FREEDOM Nice, we'll reach herd immunity vaccine available. Ya, get wanting completely isolate year long, 14 days hunkering seems like totally fair trade exchange getting properly meet grandchild. 

We're similar situation. daughter born December last year. Luckily extended family got meet lockdowns started, otherwise ton people she'd never see 2+. ""So, living?""

""Oh, I'm swiss cheese analyst. you?"" Ah, sucks. Still might able force came that, hopefully resolved way impacts least. awful he's making feel scared trapped home. right that, lease not. already full ND, MN taking overflow already.  think sensible vitamin supplement would hurt anyone, people dumb. take whole bottle think makes immune COVID. work medicine. see dumb shit. Also - go doc please let know supplements take! Even multivitamin day. things matter! Ah yes something Americans hopefully understand taking care yourself, working out, taking supplements, eating fast food everyday like fat fuck? slice cheese graph? pretty good am. People shut fuck listened advice. back normal months. Deaths follow. also bull *public* health *individual* choice. 

We're dealing something like obesity personal choices generally personal consequences.

A contagious disease means personal choices also direct public consequences. 

It's reason traffic laws mandates. imagine shit show would ensue told people needed take personal responsibility fight drunk driving team without clear mandates punishments... Come it. ""Infection Fatality Ratio (IFR): number individuals die disease among infected individuals (symptomatic asymptomatic).""

I sorry, science bend ignorance. CDC uses scientific data verified mathematic equations ever changing virus, ever changing data, therapeutics getting better. math literally changing understand virus better understanding going on. ""The number individuals die disease among infected individuals"" keeps going lower lower. 

So scientific perspective, using IFR lot valid scientific ignorant ""mortality rate"". virus going.

Let break barney style. Tom Brady starts game. 1st drive goes 1 2. 50% pass completion. 2nd drive goes 3 4. time 75% completion rate. 3rd drive goes 4 5 80% completion rate. game still going.

So right official game completion rate game going. would wrong say Tom's completion rate 50% accounts 1st drive. cannot give full game answer. completion % increasing last drive around 73% completion percentage. data is. IFR virus. updating time.

So asking exist virus still going. shows lack understand basic math, true lack Science gathered.

You keep crying Breitbart. like shown you, one ignorant science. one needs realize data collected presented. problem Breitbart issues. point, hospitals Minnesota filling people North Dakota speak. Ronaldo unbelievably healthy doubt realised test. probably set record fastest recovery time knowing him. think going door door pandemic good idea all. proven presence ""antibodies"".

You ‚Äúprove‚Äù anything want right dismiss science. Perhaps, give ideas...   Or, governor/mayor breaks his/her bones implements another lockdown full recovery? I'm fun, lol. War always enjoyed broad bipartisan support US. public health virus experts, economists, psychologists, etc discuss things way based party politics. situation US people reject masks based wanting show political identity. also people recognize threat COVID-19, don‚Äôt engage costs 7 year olds remote learning, possibly far incompetent US leadership possible.

The problem pretty clear US Trump sycophants directly contradict try intimidate public health officials.

As far US goes, reality wait January.

It might unfair lay feet politics. reality Trump‚Äôs response COVID killing beyond base. running government like businesses, makes bad decisions feed ego bankrupt business. ""We crappiest response world, would ten times worse respond way did!""

So every country better? brilliant tactics employ didn't? already bottom barrel, much credit think deserve burrowing barrel Ch.....

China. Ah. makes sense now.  joke? I'm predicting news article.  Physical distancing standing away people. Social distancing going see people Glad going hikes trying best keep active! That's going great heart.

People killing money perspective lockdown environment idiots louder ever, empowered current administration. *Per capita cases line places shut week.* Big deal type like one tho. That's lack self awareness holds back. Seriously, go away - waste time, troll. (You blocked) 1918 influenza became seasonal influenza persisted 1957. Eventually everyone caught it. anyone know long exposed virus take test positive it? North Rhine Westphalia Berlin explode daily cases. Uhhh it‚Äôs one two people.

Poverty also high Argentina, many former middle class people poor. *Amy Coney Barrett entered chat* Okay like, lives unthinkably altered months end end sight, this, like, news anyone?

Indeed, bit bland Fauci keeps touting quite obvious facts. Maybe glimpse hope repeating these, people start take pandemic seriously US. happening. Groundhog Day US end.

Let guess Fauci soon say ""if keep going like this, Christmas season difficult"". narrator's voice says ""and Christmas season became difficult"".

Don't get wrong, still think Fauci cool guy. true want improve things. know situation garbage US long time, long time. Fauci presenting facts much change it. Memory B cells reside lymph nodes undetectable blood plasma 6 years later demonstrate lacking. Yes antibodies produced short lived B plasma cells last thus may loose sterilizing immunity, Memory Cells confer disease protection, likely reduce infectivity. current observed reinfection rate 1 million, clearly insufficient sustain infection. since corona virus mutates incredibly slowly, vaccination easily reduce RO 1 eliminate disease. Cold corona virus annual event, sufficient number non immune children need build population outbreak occur. immunity wanes adults would get similar number infections children. fact clearly demonstrates long lasting immunity disease, although possible get asymptomatic infections. influenza 90% infection asymptomatic. Last Halloween gave candy, one last people get candy mom little girl, girl sneezed me.

Mom goes, oh gosh! I'm sorry, sniffles..

4 days later I'm sniffling, shooting green yucks nose throat.

As precaution others, let everyone else give candy house stays dark.

Not afraid, risk it? dont type like asshole doesnt mean imma child guy. bet put averageredditor bc acting like one cannot travel country many federal states declared hotels must ban people risk cities districts. 5.6 million tests 48 hours? *They act time relative case arrival date.* Name five. Five people happened people realise eyes ears exposed people touch face face mask rendering useless unless proper precaution used. acted way time data. difference non-controllable factors. 

I get want feel like solvable worked harder smarter, everyone thing different results points different reality. Sorry little complicated ""you're stupid wrong."" Jesus, fuck kind dystopian madhouse people running there? terms actual deaths, yes would remain constant. tested, whilst died daily count. 

I dont think excess deaths wave bad first, become apparent coming months. 

The gap reported deaths excess deaths much smaller though fascinating me. material particular would recommend learn software development? thoughts prayers important, people!! listens RKI scientists suggest. seriously trolling right? mean like actual full lockdown policy would eradicate virus? stock market needs holes keep going, duh.  [I seen timeline, late mid September saying end 2021 possibly 2022. even he's clear means it'll ""completely behind get paid ‚Äúdonation‚Äù Covid antibodies. lot more...

UK international. forget, kept saying masks gave false sense security based gut feeling. Fucking AMAZING right shut someone‚Äôs business livelihood cannot force people wear mask public places

Where earth make sense ? sealed tank top line air filtration system - hepa. RKI Karl Lauterbach. NZ clearly learned. acted accordingly.

The results in. actions taken clear. obviously want give credit due. Sure call get NFL tickets :) /S

I personally think drastic think would help LOT. say two months? I‚Äôm surprised. perfect Germany, called ""concept"" schools open vents regularly completely 15 minutes students bring warm clothes blankets feel cold. months plan ahead even suggested prolong winter holidays 4 weeks shorten summer 2021 holidays.  use Gouda cheese instead? holes. Check Mate! failures learn yet - things Italy starting get bad, said earlier, dozens places shut week (likely result seeing Italy). like NZ saw earlier, saw time happened less community spread. muh lockdowns accidentally caught covid college recovered donate blood something? saying Accusing politicians hypocrisy like accusing mammals breathing. theory could work. CNA job requires certification worth $16 hour business, pays unless/until trouble filling position pay rate. CNA currently working going quit it? Maybe enough could force change, people need pay cheque. still warm surprisingly, Italy cold already. ‚ÄúWait two months‚Äù next ‚Äúwait two weeks‚Äù üòÇ Cases mean nothing. Hospitalizations deaths mean everything. many people actually sit around waiting media politicians tell live live?

Edit: statistical significant difference wearing wearing mask. Eurocrats really pleased go fully mask authoritarian subjects, pretext fighting disease.

I‚Äôve never glad US. True, though I'd still expect deaths figure less skewed increased testing cases though.

I suppose time excess deaths figure become apparent, like March. death rate, hospitalization rate, covid generally comparable novel influenza, virus contagious longer, people hospitalized tend stay hospital longer. People usually develop long lasting immunity particular strain flu. rate asymptomatic carriers probably lower novel influenza. think worst case flu actually pretty manageable. would suck, even influenza equal 1918 would far fewer fatalities oxygen therapy antibiotics manage bacterial pneumonia colonizing damaged lungs.

The 2003 SARS coronavirus goddamn nightmare, case fatality rate almost 10%, extremely contagious. difficult costly contain, consequences spread widely catastrophic. *That* worst case scenario, motherfucker presumably still bat population. Useful informative all, made go fridge get slice cheese nibble. called ""concept"" schools open vents regularly completely 15 minutes students bring warm clothes blankets feel cold. months plan ahead even suggested prolong winter holidays 4 weeks shorten summer 2021 holidays. Wouldn‚Äôt effectively end pandemic? It‚Äôs take home pill. mean, disease causes neuroimmune inflammation, means cannot activity raises heart rate without spending weeks bed unable much feed myself. Still figured out. I'm saying people make work really want without spending time blaming public health policy makers jobs. Everyone know except one person Corona App. 22% Germans installed (total population count). still hope reasoning. Oh, mean study 6 macaques? call extensive testing injecting humans, right I'm wrong. Thanks proving point. go away. might saying sleeps people consistently properly use fluid protection, 'gross'. strong method used properly. doubt that's case.

As morality, really stems idea STDs unfaithful. If, logic goes, relations spouse, impossible get STD. Leaving aside accidents like transfusions, dirty needles, poor hygiene medical equipment. Thus STDs cheaters thus gross.

If ever 1 sexual partner, ought tested. current society lot moral freedom sexuality. responsible it. made point NZ learned failures abroad.

Good NZ. Trump opportunity certain parts US, yet completely blew it.

And keep pointing out, want community spread hit hard moving prevent it. Delays make worse. always heard like came tartare rare steaks? took flight Stockholm instead. Sweden nice country travel around in. better Germany, called ""concept"" schools open vents regularly completely 15 minutes students bring warm clothes blankets feel cold. months plan ahead even suggested prolong winter holidays 4 weeks shorten summer 2021 holidays. Yup least now, probably higher. area certainly needs it... lot cases/hospitalizations/deaths here.

Public transit basically 100% mask wearing luckily. longer 2 weeks see massive spike. Person infected, probably somewhere around 3-5 days contagious another 3-5 get tested result shows numbers. Person B let's say gets infected day 4, get sick mean somewhere around 5 days. another 3-5 days get tested test shows numbers. Also might locked down, people wearing masks, staying home, distancing? county lockdowns months cases remained pretty steady people wearing masks distancing themselves. seem key. UK many done everything allowed, whether sensible not. Sweden seems done sensible, whether mandated not. probably mentioned Swine Flu all, talking 1968 pandemic, one one remembers. that's said prior.

500,000 still lot people, matter want slice it. Yes, COVID killed more, death death. vaccine available specific groups, healthy frontline medics, low production capacity. Also, vaccine technically approved (approval based study 76 participants), still currently going phase 3 trials volunteers take months vaccine available general population. People following rules almost half year. don‚Äôt think follow rules new measures. Corona shown lot stupid, oblivious people Netherlands. read comments online. hope they‚Äôre fake trolls it‚Äôs real Netherlands secretly developed ‚ÄòIdiocracy‚Äô like country Knowing know now, even short lockdown like China's seems fairly unnecessary. could continued living lives normal addition masks. could today, it. But, course, don't. Yeah mean addressed fact significant additional data testing available point weeks earlier establish much fact. 

Here's another one - day NZ announced actual lockdown, March 25th, total 205 confirmed cases. day IL did, 583 - IL's population nearly 3x larger. made decision based extremely similar data. Difference one location much community spread, *no one could know yet enough tests*. 140 million Americans happy job he's doing.

It's okay, say ""Alex Jones"", safe space here.   tested Friday Though apparently almost beliefs, still ended something different you.

I'm dad child. pandemic hit, obeyed governor's orders isolate. since still allowed exercise outside ride bikes (with masks), learned first hand even lockdown people taking seriously. young son saw kids neighborhood play other, without masks.

At time April made working assumption pandemic would go long time; thought maybe till fall. Little know.

But even estimate, justify locking son in. followed orders state, county City. beyond that, judgement calls. let son play kids neighborhood, even without masks. play outside. cold, put warm jackets play garage.

I eaten restaurant since March, think many months. wear masks stores drive throughs. go gyms, bars, movies, sports games stuff. reduced health risk factors much could, like weight, nutrition, sleep, vitamin d.

We go two vacations though. Drove car, stayed vacation rentals house ourselves.

I can't say enjoy risks, trade off. son likely risk, I'm going ruin mental health well locking year. multi millionaires billionaires dont work all. Anyone 10 million assets make 500k year interest conservative 5%. 

I really get billionaires work all. much money
why retire enjoy made. know would spend years traveling, boating anything world wanted. many people excited Oxford vaccine rushing it?

People rushing vaccine politics, saves lives. Stop assuming politicians control people run trials, don't. see vaccine hit market safe, unless live country like Russia China.  imagine calling someone sheep heard someone friday night circle jerk say literally reading table right. gave article understand article science lingo know hard people like understand.

It tells valuing ""Parameter values disease severity, viral transmissibility, pre-symptomatic asymptomatic disease transmission represent best estimate, based latest surveillance data scientific knowledge.¬† Parameter values based data received CDC August 8, 2020""

Then tables axis ""Infection Fatality Ratio"" 

Where line literally 

""0-19 years: 0.00003
20-49 years: 0.0002
50-69 years: 0.005

Why fear that? fear science saying? CDC says fine. need stop fear mongering. also kinda need read science comprehension. ignorance likely keep pushing fear others. baijiu (hard liquor) would kill virus, stupid people believing eating spicy hotpot would burn germs, ad nauseam.

October, first cases backtracked November 2019, heard anyone near Wuhan Hubei region getting reinfected. think year pretty fair, especially considering vaccine likely effective causing immunity recovering infection.

Pretty much reinfections people compromised immune systems, possible false-negatives. Huh, always thought suicides. Nope, wrong (not really misinformed, never saw source said one another).

Still bleak AF matter look it. daily deaths increasing.  Editors nationwide strike misleading headline stat sites. One death increase. It‚Äôs rate increase noteworthy. California really truly peaked yet. doubt will, Governor great job people buying mask wearing. People still telling ""You can't live fear!""

If stopped living denial, need fear.

Their knee-jerked fake reassurances exactly root problem.  Yet death rate countinurs dive, bc control. Stop fear mongering.

Well yes, know started?

1. OC43, 229E, NL63, HKU1? Reinfections time

2. SARS? Never tested direct rechallenge, antibodies go quickly, even still somewhat detectable years later. Also, potential ADE issue based initial vaccine tests monkey.

3. MERS? Never tested direct rechallenge either, evidence camels (there reservoir species) get reinfected

4. Feline coronaviruses? Evidence regular reinfections

Nah, that's probably untrue. clusters absolutely thing, statistically speaking somebody knows bare minimum alive/dead status 328 people know somebody died. Since 8 million 328 million covid, they'd know 8 people average. Given death rate around 2.75% deaths/cases, there's like 20% chance (1 - .9725\^8) know somebody died it. Using ""know"" relatively, course, since really know 327th Facebook friend added extra candy crush reward?

If we're going article says there's 75k deaths, 20% becomes 26%. Still great odds, certainly impossible. worries! subject focus many months people brilliant me.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Silver bullet fallacies made often. Coronaviruses dies death thousand cuts. science background all. I‚Äôm wondering similar happened Spanish flu? historians say many caught flu type infection Spanish Flu took hold that‚Äôs older population seemed able fight may built immunity before. 
Have heard happening I‚Äôm going History documentaries. I‚Äôm genuinely interested I‚Äôm March wondered whether Covid 19 would behave way pandemic 1918/19 use ‚ÄúSwiss cheese‚Äù model time aviation relating accident prevention. Usually accidents occur, holes Swiss cheese model line up. 

You accept flaws everything, human error, technical faults, factors day etc, it‚Äôs preventative measures stop lining up! LOCK Well, know I'm making next mask of! classist, funny see. Thank you, USA really weird place eyes lol. Ha ha, agree Winnie many things, he's never suffered fools, sure! I‚Äôm extremely skeptical reports. first test could false positive initial infection never resolved intermediate test skewed. hypothetical situation, course going simplified.

Not everyone would get infected virus spreading uncontrolled overshoot spread. say, herd immunity levels infected due momentum.

About 480k people die smoking 300k die obesity related causes US year. would less number people dying covid-19 spread uncontrolled.

And due exponential growth uncontrolled spread virus would raged year.

A million old people would died US. Maybe one could argue many years live. 

But many people 50s 60s existing conditions (like obesity smoking damage) well many young people unfortunate enough immunocompromised would die.

And many would survive long term damage lungs heart brain.

Then secondary effects: hospitals would totally swamped, small fraction would get actual treatment causing many people covid-19 compared situation getting treatment.

Then tertiary effects: people conditions like heart attacks longer treated beds available. Panic hoarding would also cause lot death destruction. Make one-shot DnD Halloween special kids. Done. Maybe ADE like SARS Dengue. would pose serious threat already numerous variants virus world wide.

There also already variants evade least neutralizing antibodies. Thats even alternative, thats bullshit. vaccines covid point made people severely ill? Keep rushing though.. need make back $ somehow. good thing tax payers paying sell back people x20 price. Hey, sorry, non-American here: what's wrong Joe Rogan? watched podcasts fitness personalities passionate topic first podcast stumbled upon really liked those. generally bad followed? clarify, could lobby members congregation face-to-face. im pretty sure said months now. it?

Secondly, need compare amount deaths Sweden countries around (Norway, Finland, Denmark) realize enormous failure. save economy suffered similarly countries lockdown. yeah, sacrificed shit ton people gain whatsoever.

Third, FAR Covid free. Yesterday, reported 919 cases rookie numbers compared US Swedish cases climbing day day.  Yeah think protective necessarily sterilizing. hope immunity covid19 turns sterilizing Send em packing! I‚Äôm 50 autoimmune disease want avoid becoming spreader. That‚Äôs enough reason take it. I'm Belgian, stereotype. 

Compared Netherlands, rules laws ignored often Belgium, entire country chaotic. (except schools, Dutch schools chaotic)

It's quite obvious soon cross border gets worse, south go. advantages sometimes virus compromise. Lol...I know link ‚ÄúNature‚Äù report easily doubles answer! Yeah literally fake corruption charges Lula win okay first death world due reinfection coronavirus. This. point, else new? way awhile friend. Start reversing fixing polls. say doesn‚Äôt give fuck kids, ok dying? fuck never said Italy get numbers lower. reporting something subreddit isn't, Italy second wave. read enough place, think US place virus anymore.  data massively flawed, vaccines even reach human trials, animal testing first. animal testing Covid vaccines trials went straight 1-3, without analyzing data phase 1&amp;2 trials.

The potential dangers long term effects even involved, possible test within months.  Slow? First death globally caused reinfection. Yikes. Nope ""Americans"", mostly ""white people"" refer Yeah, correct said ""there evidence"" absence evidence evidence absence...

Notable I‚Äôve dentist four times get multiple fillings redone. Ah yes another herd immunity post ......people died problems therefore deaths mean much.. Infection lasts 2 weeks, post-recovery complications last varying lengths. debunked deliberate misinterpretation CDC data still repeated? gb didnt close borders like nz bingo excess mortality spike massively, following exact trend COVID deaths, rising falling again?

You see excess mortality lowered, even lockdowns continued. Therefore proves lockdowns causing vast majority excess deaths. idk. sarcastic making fun people say absurd things like that. August misleading title. Approximately 10,000 death certificates filled improperly. apply literally crime disproportionately punishes marginalized people. mean like America? 280,000 suicides caused lockdowns. /s excess mortality spike massively, following exact trend COVID deaths, rising falling again?

You see excess mortality lowered, even lockdowns continued. Therefore proves lockdowns causing excess deaths. I‚Äôm claiming covid fake anything like that, extreme lockdowns madness needs stop. CDC:

The CDC last month issued new estimates showed people 50 years infected COVID-19 nearly 100% survival rate. broke 99.997% survival rate 0-19; 99.98% ages 20-49; 99.5% 50-69; 94.6% 70.

Those died coronavirus, according CDC, average 2.6 comorbidities, meaning two chronic diseases along COVID-19. Overall, CDC says, 6% people counted COVID-19 deaths died COVID-19 alone. one drugs Trump got. Check list. poor parts Boston NYC people described links. access medical care one reason another. Sometimes distance, sometimes money, sometimes refusal seek medical care, usually due costs. people ones getting number 1 education best hospitals.

Those poorer areas believe told wrong information start masks distancing. couple articles clearly illustrate this. Black people told immune. large gatherings parties lockdowns poor neighborhood's. largely due lack education, disbelief told getting wrong information. links provided. father law believes stuff too. He's part Republican Boomer culture Facebook spends days glued iPhone, swapping memes reading conspiracy theory posts. Yes, mainstream news US politicians. comparing risk seeing someone (social isolation) catching covid perfectly valid assessment You‚Äôre re-catching reinfected virus never clears system. We‚Äôre ‚Äúreinfections‚Äù confirmed via genomic sequencing? Regardless handful reinfections roughly 37+million cases (WHO estimates 10% global population Covid19). made LAB China! also HOAX! time! Nothing said context. people focus airborne transmission predominant threat. CDC admitted surface transmission rare. studies affirming same. 

The focus always surface transmission. China told us airborne transmission early Feb yet denied ignored. denial primary reason containment failed, all, need wash hands, needs masks right? 

So no, comment reminding people importance airborne transmission distraction keep condescending. I'm gonna engage since waste time. legit saying ""About 75,000 Americans died COVID-19 pandemic reported spring summer, study finds"" sound like 75k people catching covid 19? Says right wing pushing false information based conspiracy theories source(s), plz Bad bot think new study recently published analyzing 4 reinfections cases. interesting read. theorize early infections never got past nasal cavity therefore mild resulted lackluster immune response.

Here link paper anyone wants read it. .28% NYC's ENTIRE population died virus. 

Even highest estimates (which problems sample bias, whatever) something like 20% NYC's population virus. 

But even 100% it, IFR TWICE high suggesting. 

You wrong. demonstrably wrong. listing propaganda. spewing propaganda. 

Fucking stop it, please. ‚ÄúIt is‚Äù UK report: workplaces, schools, nursing homes, food/dining top four. Page study: /r/COVID19/comments/ienxz9/comment/g2i3q90?context=1

Swiss study: /r/COVID19/comments/i2k25g/correction_the_places_of_contamination_are_family/

These studies quite helpful would hope. starters, large portion people reported idea whether got infected, granted probably engaged high risk activities want admit contact tracers, really know. Also, studies heavily dependent social settings open time. example, Chinese study found 80% transmission happened home, kind helpful many venues closed China time. Everything Facebook fact.... Including world flat.  linked fake news  bunch idiots, I've heard truth multiple people going back hospitals wrongful death certificates proud Dane say luckily he's part 0.2% Danish population believe stupid stuff like described (Corona hoax, made-up, masks, we're fine open etc).

Most Danes care educated enough right thing :)

Be proud! I've long covid almost 7 months

Wait, saying new, long lasting form Covid 7 months?

This groundbreaking. international news last 7 months ~2 weeks. Though, also highly doubt anyone long. It‚Äôs covered up, conspiracy theories there‚Äôs grain truth. fact check article explains. It‚Äôs federal government pays treatment COVID patients 

[politifact article Anecdotal evidence much compelling fee fees empirical evidence. 

It's everything. climate change (but cold *here moment*) gun control (but *this one time* someone shot mass shooter). I'm concerned people whose physical health severely affected incompetent choices selfish attitudes.

But, sure, someone's ""feelings"" excuse throw sick minority bus, fine. Thanks censorship.  Expressing opinion necessarily incivility. Jesus everyone sensitive days? people saw comment know read article. don‚Äôt think so. 

‚ÄúWoolf says deaths indirectly caused pandemic camefrom illnesses Alzheimer's disease, diabetes heart disease, sharply increased five states recorded COVID-19 deaths. 

Delayed care, fear seeking care emotional crises stemming pandemic could also contributed deaths, says, well inaccurate death certificates may misidentified COVID-19 death. ‚Äú appreciate apology read piece 5 times, now. misunderstanding saying, man.

It saying evidence trend children strokes Covid. saying middle aged people average younger. please, tell ok people die long health issues. sturgis, mean surges, ever happen? obesity extremely contagious? Know facts! Hey, tell matter health issues evil, evil person. One lies women told heart attack pain noticeably painful types pain.

Nope..... women experienced really bad menstrual cramps, pain heck lot worse, apparently. (I described worst cramps someone stabbing pelvis knife, twisting around times good measure. Every 30 seconds. days time. Thank you, BC pills, ending tormetnt.) still calling casedemic, rise hospitalizations shifted things ""Deaths last spike!"" mode? lockdowns overwhelmed hospitals caused people able receive care? COVID-infested emergency rooms available beds? pesky Bill Gates fella tell ya! don‚Äôt think so, poor response self inflicted.

Back February/March GOP chance fight based Trump‚Äôs comments Woodward knew bad could be, instead lied American people told would gone like magic. last week Trump similar message, go away soon.

Poor leadership anything else responsible America‚Äôs current situation. ""Herd immunity"" aka culling herd, economy's expense despite people base ""science"" politics think.   think one dollar towards Covid might save lives one dollar towards Obesity (why both? Idk, I'm American). Mods rarely go trawling thru every post/comment instead, we're focusing reported posts/comments. likely miss comments. Please help us Mods create better Reddit experience everyone reporting posts/comments break sub-rules. already estimated cdc 10% american likely already infected. mean 80% coronavirus cases asymptomatic reality death rate far far lower actually record? want hear dumb sounds asian cities dense population recorded low infection rates. Typical examples like Macau Taiwan (nearly zero infection). Every country, regardless lockdown, saw increase unemployment. shown countries lockdown worse unemployment spike without given similar COVID trajectories. Q2 unemployment increase Sweden, Finland New Zealand 2.1%, 1.2% -0.2%.

No idea point trying make, especially consider countries flatten curves reopen quicker via lockdowns better recoveries too. fucking didn't! stfu Hey, !!! stuff we‚Äôve known two months since it‚Äôs case. click bait.  ""Do research, have.""

Never drops links 'research'. family works organization hospital reporting (i cant reveal legality reasons). numbers inflated!!! know social determinates health. work MassHealth, state's medicaid program.

I said education health care part statement apply here. robust medicaid program best hospitals country see medicaid recipients matter course. US News World Reports ranks Mass number one education. yet hit hard. NYC similar story. 

I understand sources cite anything masks social distancing practices. thinks person threatened turning mods. 

He understand important distinction ""older people strokes earlier"" vs. ""kids strokes"". 

The distinction massive. 


Since essential worker kids, evidence children Covid strokes, could seriously change behaivor within home. 

The guy insecure something. Active coronavirus cases Sturgis 6,000 South Dakota. Lol they‚Äôre running psyops Russia. pay bunch people full time salaries see gets liked / shared / retweeted push users bots. past two weeks even used Russian stock footage several trump ads. allowed mention government? thought rules people still think HCQ cure even give main guy calling use? He‚Äôs troll. Add you‚Äôre block list. Salty convince morons think even 210,000 number inflated??

I'm sick arguing people think news fake news, numbers inflated researchers scientist want money, time one questions stupidity, become even emboldened believe nonsense even further. reading comments, clear trolling point. called interpretation place tailgate waiting bonnaroo line You‚Äôre evil attacking us. Stop evil creating argument nothing. You‚Äôre evil despicable, truly horrible person. Andrew Lloyd Webber‚Äôs new musical: Jesus Christ, Superspreader!  Lmao bro cousin shit man. Idk change mind. Hes sophomore high school. Point anything establishes ""right"" public health hazard global pandemic. question regarding ‚Äúessential employees‚Äù covid testing protocol. 

I work small business, 9-11 people building daily, 11 us important functionality. 

Someone place work quarantining positive children. doctor saw today told tested week. work us continue usual, plans move clients necessary appointments only. said go back call 200 clients saw week positive. normal? Worth noting employer enforce mask policy. Glad hear countries still want seniors alive. .28% NYC's ENTIRE population this. 

You trying saying low .13%. 

You wrong. wrong, incredibly obviously so. quote estimate real-world evidence shows wrong. 

Change mind. change mind question propaganda outlets feeding false information? Ok and? Watching YouTube video doesn‚Äôt mean shit one hear mark every death covid even motorcycle accident. increased volume coronavirus cases, bed availability elective procedures likely decline, states limited beds elective procedures.

That literally contradicts narrative hospitals empty. idea keep parroting lie, especially since non-elective procedures still allowed. It‚Äôs kids according science. Science also says kids spread virus. So, go continue show us don‚Äôt love people need way make feel ok. No. one cell. surface risk someone touching face practically zero. touching shopping carts, people take mask washing hands would guess people touch face properly cleaning hands too. would say you‚Äôre still providing valuable service wiping carts.

The things touch store clean (like carts) much less likely transmit virus hands aren‚Äôt prolonged contact. call defense depth matter policy rely one technology security lots cheese tend slow things down, makes sense. Yes slice cheddar know holes Swiss doesn‚Äôt work well stopping covid. Yeah connects town Bonnaroo, COVID music festival.  already even planning challenge trials uk something?  I'm sure this, seems cheesy. dont know, anxiety feel completely justified here. Australia 25 cases 13th 6 came Hotel Quarantine. Need fines. daughter (and I) got cold twice since going back daycare month half ago. They‚Äôve taken lot safety measures unless kids showing fevers apparent symptoms they‚Äôre still bound let sick kids. imagine we‚Äôll get COVID time now. people brainwashed cable news channel political affiliation. 1% chance dying anything else, absolutely it. told tribal leader. No.  numbers come straight Dr Fauci himself.

Where wrong number come from? it......... ass? ROFL idiot Yeah classical causal analysis tool used industries, conjunction cause analysis tools, drive apparent root cause(s) behind something went wrong. It‚Äôs brilliant! 1 slice cheddar would probably better. No, learn strategy. admit mistakes nursing homes, account deaths. 

Here dataset CDC cases deaths broken age: infection count anywhere 6-24x case count, [according pick 15x since middle there, take deaths/(cases*15), get following IFR age:



Age | IFR
---|---
0-4 | 0.0022%
5-17 | 0.0011%
18-29 | 0.0042%
30-39 | 0.0148%
40-49 | 0.0390%
50-64 | 0.1401%
65-74 | 0.5155%
75-84 | 1.1404%
85+ | 1.8592%

Flu IFR reference 0.1-0.2%.

So everyone 65 so, yes less deadly flu.

So learn good bad Sweden. Use targeted masks/distancing measures elderly, let everyone else live life. food shops now? collects prescriptions now?

Curbside pick drive windows exist. Thanks whoever made this.

Too many people focusing masks alone either enough, nothing. key part whole picture. That's political. facts. Agreed. Nothing stop Ronaldo.  guy infected second time isnt dead yet he? necessary uninteresting tired joke think true. One friends travelled Qingdao end Sep got test even left several days ago. kind finding-cluters-and-testing-all strategy implemented several times since Beijing outbreak. People convinced impossible eliminate new cases accept new normalcy . Learned play music lack creativity necessary get attention? Try Christian contemporary. tried paint numbers. We've brought great fun music composition. image automatically article. It‚Äôs pretty common type image cell death virus. Yeah, headline isn‚Äôt great, given people occupy hospital bed weeks, single days worth cases weeks starts add up. North Dakota big trouble based current trajectory. I'm hungry. 

Thank OP, cool! Check RCT Hell fuck no. We've told 1000 different things. Masks dont work. Masks work. Cloth useless. Cloth required. Stays surfaces 8 hours, oh 8 days, oh wait 80 days. Dont go outside. Jk go outside stay 6 feet apart. Jk 12 feet. Jk 12 meters.

Fuck shit. Bring nukes I'm thru.  load bullshit. virus doesn‚Äôt care rich poor. EVERYONE needs wear face covering public right now. don‚Äôt see someone‚Äôs economic status ability wear face covering avoid gathering crowds. calling joke, said joke. sub using image described joke. figure? moving jobs overseas skills thing, ""seeing employees"" thing - webcams make easy hold face-to-face anyway Lol. Cretinous fool I've seen presentated ""bowtie"" strategy. common work? "" clearly didn‚Äôt understand science behind virus ""

The science behind virus says child likely die harmed 20 things, none probably kept home prior pandemic.  people happy throw around need listen science experts tell us something seems reckless, there's tendency brush aside claim anti-science people twisting words.

Here's science: Socialization good kid

Here's also science: COVID really, really, really harmful kid. Newsom destroying people's lives give damn fair, doesn‚Äôt helicopter goes McDonald‚Äôs runs? friend mine family constantly bugging hang out, like expecting holidays. Incomprehensible think metricis widely documented CDC, WHO, accepted infectious disease experts. begging needed vaccine!!!
/s excuses instituting mask mandate made sense whatsoever... -The new generation like DT may appeared again
-Future people threat history like BS hoax antivax antimask still survived
-I bet vaccine based CRISPR maybe become new defense future
-Diehard religion become variety based strong organism consequences everything. deny people ability cross border long time destroy families, ruin careers, damage foundational supply chain produces goods society depends on. can't completely shut everything forever stop virus. commenting image joke? see image? Akshually, assuming part work force lives less valuable. #capitalism go spend way, way much money overpriced food. Problem solved. Testing hard come around right now. woke stuffy nose, likely keep work week longer rapid tests available end week. Better safe potential super spreader guess, improve. Second wave
Third wave

Will never go awy

Permanent lockdowns trace people ‚Äúprevent spreads‚Äù know rest lot people stuck inside getting sick going insane Wow good you. must smart. ate INDOORS restaurant, got hair cut INSIDE worked gym INDOORS

Why? We're middle pandemic. None activities safe enough right now. terms risk management, one half what's called bowtie strategy... shape bowtie comes knot middle fans two directions...

If consider ""catching covid"" knot ways prevent likelihood (various entry points one side) ways reduce cost catch (various exit paths side).

Google images diagrams. basically taking ""swiss cheese"" strat vector defined. swiss cheese side too... smoke, get rest, seek medical support early .. many things avoid &amp; fall seriously ill. CNN considered ""reliable"" here? he's still voting Trump, Green wants people sides political spectrum understand severity pandemic.

The whole sentence much better.

He wants ""both sides"" ""understand severity""?

Like, dude, we're ones lacking understanding. conscious decision made man loved ones could snuffed reelection still voting him. god damn creepy, people. Nobody ever licked GWB's boots hard.  kind point I've trying make. main idea behind paper complication due pandemic causing people die lot different causes. 

You seem want make point complications mostly lockdown. see logic there, know there's direct evidence that. Certainly lockdown causing people seek medical attention less frequently, many people delaying lockdown many fear contacting virus? Furthermore many direct deaths Covid would without lockdowns? complex questions require lot investigation presented answer. hidden AZN? One person reaction paused study resumed. Another person reaction pauses study resumed countries except US. Nothing really hidden. information first person known second person issue. learn read graphs. would better lying would saying something like ""We evidence masks work""

That's still deception. still designed manipulate people.

The trouble manipulating people good things become manipulatable. someone manipulate bad ways later... conditioned defenses manipulation.

It's propaganda that. important things leader time like listen scientists 

Trump's fuckt[censored automoderator bot!]ard. There's disputing this. Trump though, issue speak of.

The motivation downplaying masks early one worried shortages medical providers.

This has, long term, backfired. used deniers everywhere. easy shut up, they've certainly got point say honest mistake. positive result public?
Is negative result public?

Then yes two sides though. Singapore manage community spread well, migrant workers essentially kept lockdown since April without many proactive measures taken look mental health. Gonna Bless-ed cheesemakers Meanwhile, Asia... Think saw Tennessee 3k, wowzers many Coronavirus vaccines approved humans?
I think efforts develop Coronavirus vaccine almost 20 years without success. addition, single mRNA vaccine approved humans, entirely new technology.
Multiple animal trials (for mRNA vaccines SARS) failed, due severe complications.
The current Oxford vaccine trials would likely over, normal circumstances. higher chance getting killed someone know catching dying Coronavirus.

Look percentages. It‚Äôs true. Harsh fair - say someone looking vote Tory candidate. need gene sequenced simply get infected twice.

One actually tested get infected twice.

However, research standpoint, methodology eliminates options absurdly restrictive, passes peer review critical reviewers. really sucks, Orthodox community NYC hit incredibly hard yet sunk many morons part it. Rest Peace. anything? bad news, normal. 

But likely short delay so, bad news, big deal. No.   15-20% identified cases require hospitalization. Please, tell isolate vulnerable people without ever coming contact non-vulnerable people. food shop them? collect prescriptions? demand chips. 
/s fact actually shown..... hope took summer get shape.

The answer massive outbreak 100k + dead US. Free volunteer students studying abroad. Chinese need get vaccine next months. Haggis. That‚Äôs weirder. No, it‚Äôs not. true, also keep mind one day reported cases. People occupy hospital bed weeks. 15-20% identified cases admitted hospital, math eventually leads beds occupied. talking point Cult-45 Twitter ""it would 2,000,000 China ban.""

Minds like steel traps - nothing ever gets in. trial designs - consecutive non-randomized patients, different physicians deciding gets - huge limitation. Treatment decisions influenced patient doing. 

This big problem retrospective study purporting show HCQ worked Detroit. patients getting drug ""shorter"" stays high death rate - indicating advanced cased treatment likely judged futile. better information great analogy risk assessment. Theres plenty people say, ""If social distancing works need masks?"" bad question, though exactly answer.

The reverse also true, people believe need social distance, masks, cancelling every event known man bother. truth ought using many layers protection reasonable. Would advise Swiss cheese air filters. course they‚Äôre important yes we‚Äôre trying save need find dying Yeah tourists flying like crazy speak. Lol. 
Random testing would useful instead testing blues gov forced go. gov truly shameful many got stage two trials, counting covid? No, person posting misinformation. agree?

jesus, freaking troll. Maybe, NY lot tests non-symptomatic people. think they'd root rare. America China now?

/s Trump beat drum expediting vaccine.

So everyone jump board sham since one position power wants nervous Nellie naysayer.

Politically speaking, easiest course try develop vaccine, shrug shoulders months happen.  

If takes another 18 months develop vaccine, probably matter, anyway. point, therapies improved virus likely started burn out.  going last forever. G variant relevance reinfection. 

It creating new antigenic properties enabling evasion immune system thus reinfection

Meanwhile looking G variant confirm reinfection -- sequencing whole genome looking nucleotide difference it, plenty, confirm could evolution within individual resulted second presentation  I‚Äôll happy take vaccine passes rigorous scientific review there‚Äôs scientific consensus amongst experts subject influence current administration say it‚Äôs safe effective. That's snowbirds make sure spend enough time Canada maintain universal healthcare understand hesitation, especially given new virus, random claim. based research infected patients best science data have.

Every public health dept doctor US follows guidelines right now. least everywhere seen, I've done lot research. got covid every single medical professional talked said thing. went see doctors prestigious hospital networks. thousands thousands patients guidelines given everyone. public health dept also cleared using 10 day rule (from onset symptoms), even though still symptoms (but improving).

So thing feel relaxed, definitely isolate longer yourself. everyone going tell doctors even tell careful. literally told ""you cleared"" ""not contagious"" 10 days onset symptoms. precautions given anything. people go back normal life right away. 

You check CDC Ok, let put way: viruses people typically clear (herpes , HIV) ones people normally clear (cold, flu, coronaviruses).

The ones people typically clear tend ones people get reinfected. 

Certain really rare, freak cases clear type. change point. Japans excess deaths first half year 5k recently watched first couple seasons Tudors, sweating sickness blazing England, bet Henry VIII covering mouth nose cloth. Considering much attention detail director put show... really. People understand happening *always knew* would 18 months. basically goalpost. like tell child bad news once, would try take one day time. 

They take us weeks time, humans. mean initial estimates *incorrect* we're changing things. Initial estimates something public could handle. I'm seeing feeling everywhere, hysterical people freaking maybe wear mask grocery store 2022 that's apocalypse. 

That's government talk happening little time, people emotionally cannot handle reality. hard emotionally.  Uhh... poster posting misinformation?

Yes. Mostly places worship stop large gatherings. individuals. evidence except fear mongering hopes wishes. Yet say read article title misleading. reading comprehension skills lacking. title would matched bias commentary article would shrugged shoulders moved on. Nope title wanted capitalize fear get people bite. Congratulations. got look believe look come realization got bamboozled yellow journalism. Well mods removed reply links evidence. Soooo :) likely false.

The CDC guideline 10 days least 24 hours fever *without using fever reducers*. letter used careful wording say he's ""been keeping temperature control"" ""I longer fever.""  also shows danger relying upon self-reported symptoms person vested interest getting back work soon possible. virus works clusters. one friends party bunch friends someone introduced virus, well you‚Äôd know lot people party, actually

certainly country seeing quality people America offer, really wish way joking, seem like best candidate eventually lead change way things. 

The half jokingly initial plan always got sick road, I‚Äôd go evangelical churches healed instead risking getting doctor sick myself. know universal testing‚Äôs use isn‚Äôt limited right? proves world citizens Hong Kong safe again, safe lift restrictions business tourists again, revitalising current economy Moderna vaccine gave agree? doesn‚Äôt work way reality harm shared unevenly, gives sense magnitude.

In actuality, like poor people work extra five years live, wealthy people work six months *less* Vaccines one LEAST profitable products Pharma company, single dose. Or, dose every 1-5yrs most. 


They make WAY money products people use every day - blood pressure medication, insulin, pain killers etc - doses = $$$. incredibly self evident. Denmark too? thought Netherlands. I‚Äôm socal too. Nice smoke. Still recovering Thomas fire.  fair, they‚Äôve around 10 years pretty much working exclusively mRNA vaccines, none ever approved Chicago here. coworker suffer heart attack February vacay Vegas. fine now. (Aged around 70)

Then another coworker passed away heart attack May. (Aged around 60)

Then, learned ex coworker company 10 years died sleep last month (suspected heart attack aged around 50)

Ive company 4 years year 4 know people died.. omg. even looks like sucks. Already do, ya selfish fuck. Yeah I'm arguing common is, happen. Considering know coronaviruses hypothesis unlikely.

That two previous novel coronavirus' gave long term protection survivors. cherry pick coronavirus', come totally different conclusions lasting immunity.

We don‚Äôt enough SARS Cov 2 talk lasting immunity. know coronavirus' general give lasting immunity don‚Äôt. That's also particularly conclusive. Yeah, market since January, numbers posted. useless recently 2 years ago. Collapse currency (this time) pretty recent. like double whammy economy torture. awful ""If report could exonerate President, would state so"" - Bob Mueller Hate Canada‚Äôs healthcare system want. It‚Äôs still way better America‚Äôs. Herd immunity. yes, INCREDIBLY rare cases. applies virus. 

But talking about. cite instances Covid-19 reinfection existed less year, herpes zoster human history. Wash hands wear mask , you‚Äôll aiight one health condition observe! I'll go ahead assume that's joke rooting virus :) one deserves contract thing much less serious complications it, including friends trumper parents. Cheers.  Thanks letting know - I'm glad hear least they're okay They‚Äôll back eventually, already are, though don‚Äôt trust enough go right now. estimates right get mass vaccine distribution 2nd quarter next year people immune end next year. Enjoy waiting years see physician. would know, live Canada.

Also worthy note: many top graduates aspire work US rather stay here. Universal healthcare leads brain drain subpar medical professionals. I'll believe Chinese reports start respecting human rights. Except people family friends, neighbors, classmates, co-workers, getting exposed means get exposed. Kids getting give parents, aunts uncles grandparents get it. Friends neighbors get it.


20% deaths U.S. 65.


More people 55 died Covid-19 months year's worth murders ages.


Also U.S. lockdown. been. asked stay home could weeks. Armed protesters marching streets back April. businesses open. Schools reopened. Colleges open. Restaurants open. Disney World open. Anti-maskers punched staff member Sesame Street theme park months ago.


""Lockdown"" needs quotes talking U.S. I'm saying wrong politicians calling virus hoax, wearing masks, detrimental public health...

But politics impacted vaccine timeline? *vaccine* article about, OP talking, talking about... Definitely find great chorizos everywhere Argentina. (Chorizo sausage, pan brad).
In patagonia specialty lamb, put like Cruz fire amazing. Asado like argentinian BBQ, amazing everywhere good mix everything :) Buy Idaho 1.8 million population. know Battleship still theaters there? Nothing see here, move along fuck value life someone young? Also, 99% surviving age 50 mean people died, even 10 years old. people families longer get people loved. Stop thinking life statistic remember every single death family friends behind it. Yeah don‚Äôt know reported, coronavirus class predominately *winter* type. it‚Äôs going get worse peeps NDAs can't used enforce illegal activities, would insurance fraud part hospital. Walz isn‚Äôt planning locking facing criticism locking first time. wonder this‚Äôll bite us rear later? Nah really though. got Covid, never tested (our terrible testing system), died, never tested improperly labeled something else. making false narrative people pushed based zero evidence. know 26 year old athlete died heart attack April active guy early 50‚Äôs weird stroke heart attack died months covid. don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre coincidences. study said common cold corona viruses produces immunity lasts 6 24 months? might months wrong something like that. would make sense starting see reinfections behaves same. mom always told wouldn‚Äôt accomplish anything lying bed day. look now, ma! I‚Äôm saving world! know of, due faulty tracing. Roughly 1 40 people US have, it. theory, know least 8 people going 328 facebook friends. see 1000-1500 people week them, handful it. Weird.

Edit: I'm saying ""weird"" sarcastically, believe widespread. I'm saying legitimately odd know many people it. people don‚Äôt really get. Testing good, it‚Äôs true metric success. mean testing gold standard measure COVID19 responses, US would among best.

Japan‚Äôs positive test rate remains low, fatality rate remains low, hospitalization rate remains low. reallly support point though. makes argument social safety nets correlated mitigating excess death pandemic poverty-stricken countries extremely susceptible economic disruption. anything, shows first world countries good shot enduring lockdowns without much pain impoverished countries endure. Indeed, see born data. Nearly countries avoided early unmitigated spread Europe well impoverished country, point risk/benefit valid, results support opposite rich countries avoided early unmitigated spread. Literally everyone cares selfish fucks. California still shut down. Newsom gone mad. needs removed office immediately quarantined recommended time laid CDC. He's fit go back work. I‚Äôm pasting happened clipboard got comment (see posting history), Lock now. Dont even risk 3rd wave. Lock down! Due political interference, probably never know many people really died Covid-19. literally called lockdowns ""ghastly global catastrophe"".

That written article linked. read article? fact medical bills needs create fucking GoFundMe account pay bills tells everything need know US healthcare system. Complete fucking failure. Four, six.

There approved emergency use China, full scale deployment. That's still waiting phase 3 result.

Oh wow, phase 3 trial countries count say so? counties allowed legitimate phase 3 trials? allies US?

It matters not, countries including China joined COVAX. one 4 become successful, vaccine vast majority planet go for. fair, many retired military leaders him. (The currently employed ones presumably want remain employed.) Lockdowns serve delay inevitable, countries never come close hospitals overwhelmed useless. Different cultures I'd wager. French lot physical one another big gatherings around food extremely common. Ok. Antibodies produced B cells, subset become memory cells persist life. cells kill virus infected cells same. obsession antibodies silly. sure ain't South Pole. live state believes science, health care funding government sufficiently resident tested free questions asked time simply rocking testing site. kids one every week two.

Apparently word blue banned sub. [There clinically diagnosed cases also Sad unnecessary True. That's gotta one hell unexplained illness. mean nitpick here, homes actually time highs much US. ""corporations"" buying houses, families looking first home too. Head /r/realestate see many complaining current environment.

Maybe things settle bit foreclosures session, December 31st. I'm sure. incredibly important people understand clinical trials work. absolutely important necessary. Even best clinical trial conditions takes months/years establish whether medications safe public consumption. would guess missing many deaths? Also young population..... something add up. many headlines involving words ‚Äúpriest‚Äù ‚Äúdominatrices‚Äù, hey, kudos proper Latin plural. Yes, trend (albeit shallower) still hold cases hospitalizations

I mean, [this clearly know talking saying there's trend.  weekly basis, results last week (total number tests performed) usually updated either later today tomorrow. Last week changed bit reporting report unique people tested within week alongside total tests performed update Thursday 2.9% week 40, increase 2.4 1.6 previous weeks. airborne disease lol Funny Swiss cheese actually fits guidelines face covering outbreak linked hospital

^ I'm sorry unwilling admit said that, wrong

Read article Los Angeles thing.... situation called carmagedon one important freeway passes area going shut 72 hours weekend (it actually engineering feat upon itself). 

The pass two major population centers divided mountain little alternative routes. ability paralyze emergency services (and essential workers) people went normal weekend activities ie beaches one side mountain. 

So government went three month advertising spree convince people stay home. instilled fear 8 hour traffic jams such. 

Essential workers rented hotel rooms stayed friends side needed on. People go beach weekend. Etc. end, said carmagedon one lightest traffic weekends years. 

Then came ""why government exaggerate?"" cries. 

It's basically perfect analogy governing pandemic. damned do, damned don't. Cheese Eyes Holes  ""You trust Johnson &amp; Johnson?!"" Couple dozen verified reinfections one death reinfection worldwide 37 million + verified cases good thing... means people probably developing antibodies least temporarily provide immunity, rate would way higher. would like subscribe Aviation-related cheese analogies. didnt want live guilt gave selfishness live America people would still buy them. Masks efficient beards

A lot times, I've seen articles saying ""we cannot return old normal"", stuff like that, think that's lot people's panic might stem - whether genuinely believe articles trolling. 

I understand underlying motive message discourage people trying ""return old normal"" *right now* vaccine yet. matter fact, type messaging probably counterproductive, seriously consider finding better way word it. 

I agree articles one bit. you? Careful, that's easy way get downvoted sub, posting facts get COVID twice really thought something headline. Yikes. Maybe reading comprehension gone look like needed put another way, seems like \*point\* likely thing commenting pretty clear. chickenpox can, fact, eliminated, reinfection occur. said ""**That's true all**. get herpes zoraster, life can't ""get again"" "".

Again, part confusing you? explain you.

You use acid heat well. holes swiss cheese go pieces, maintaining open path time. it‚Äôs example scientific paper... Tell 225,000 already dead.

Or 1 6 people go develop complications.

You people absolutely fucking clueless. Yea best thing step minimum effort. Spend tiny time getting good comfortable masks. they're nice masks mind wearing nearly much. unexpected? get cold multiple times, that's coronavirus too.

What's worrisome fact seems like people gotten second time - worse first go around, counterintuitive.

Why say ""there shortages""? Ah sorry got confused. you‚Äôre actually saying herd immunity *not* likely, then. saying immune system flawed respect common cold definitely made pause. Cold viruses circulated much likely evolve pace outruns immune systems. flaw immune system, that's evolutionary advantage nature rapidly reproducing species.

Also, claim scientist understand proteins virus - fucking LOL. genetic sequence mean know DNA encodes. Give break.

Anyhow, personal reasons, hypocrite. know answer discouraging times. know folks highly educated, engineers masters degrees etc., deny science vaccines wearing mask, losing hope humanity.  Really way egotistical? everyone work home. Get high horse see many us choice. free isolate rest life, care. whole comment full irony. where's freedom live normally huh? Another thing registered nurses site, ignore orders call ambulance? registered nurse enough guts give sound scolding unqualified manager complaining medical deciscions. ask links:

""LOL I'm going research you! üòÇüòÇ"" top ""scientists""? really? Fauci sign it? Birx? Zhong? bet bought supplements america still struggeling good damn virus? guys still believe lie *it hoax*? ever checked media what's going countries? america it's/your freedom counts you?  QALY lost US nothing = (400,000 covid deaths) * (7.26 actuarial life years left median 82 yr old covid death)
= 2.9 million life years lost due covid

QALY lost US lockdown = (50,000 covid deaths [very generous/low assumption]) * (7.26 actuarial life years left median 82 yr old covid death) + (45,000 lockdown deaths) * (40 actuarial life years left median 40 year old) + (0.25% quality life lost average everyone lockdown [also generous assumption]) * 330 million US lives
= 3 million life years lost due covid + lockdown

I think also important lockdown deaths continue high rate next years economic/well impacts ripple throughout world, covid deaths recently slowed significantly. numbers close now, that's good sign. again, I‚Äôm disputing that. I‚Äôm 100 percent. point, person said ‚Äúunexplained‚Äù person lot others see ‚Äúpause trial‚Äù use push narrative vaccine isn‚Äôt safe, fact, putting hold trial unexplained illness exactly why, said vaccine released, deemed safe. mean don‚Äôt know enough long term health issues too? read true news, unlike people read propaganda lies.  happened Texas Arizona Florida too. one talks well California right? Truth matter matter bad state governors handled situation worked fine. truly disappeared never strike like NYC it‚Äôs gone good. fine country. Yet see people making fun waiting Fall wave lol. 100%. One people country aren‚Äôt incredibly selfish don‚Äôt immediately start protesting basic pandemic safety measures. One people take responsibility wear masks essential activities.

And it, one people don‚Äôt spread mass information directly leading people pretending covid isn‚Äôt serious now. One president doesn‚Äôt lie American people avoid causing panic. One president supports science. One president doesn‚Äôt say wear mask aren‚Äôt side. Far less amount excess deaths get properly attributed Covid CDC already said 99.9% survival rate number bullshit. isn‚Äôt CDC says.

Again get don‚Äôt give shit dead Americans compassion sympathy aren‚Äôt willing single damn thing save lives. real chip shoulder.

I'm panicking. presuming therapies improved fatality rate declines recovery improves, since odds favor that. assumption realistic one.

The odds favor vaccine within rapid timeframe pulled Trump's backside. Florida Gators coach absolute moron. Guess expected state governor opens everything Covid deaths rise. # LATE DUMB FUCKS win

The bar winning days low definition seems shifted mean something like ""not totally losing"". comes death, yes. equal (if causes death combined equal zero), more. sounds like bit overly paranoid this. agree careful public, guess wondering everyone focused Mike Lee coworker mailman delivery driver could boat would never even know.

Most people honest symptoms covid. scary illness, especially dealing home. may think someone would want lie go back work feel good last thing want do, especially end needing medical help want correct symptoms medications file. 

So truly, think vast majority people lie taking fever reducing medications. difficult pretend feel good, hours end, front cameras, Mike Lee do. someone truly felt ill, would put position. 

And I'm sure Mike Lee smart enough know became worse anyone found lying would potentially charged criminal offense. there's too. actually undiagnosed Covid died result, counted. either way still result Covid-19 pandemic.

Lockdowns fear didn‚Äôt kill people, give break. Deaths attributed covid 20% higher previous years. Makes sense healthcare system overwhelmed people conditions fall cracks. mention, Kane's daughter Nurse best friends mom died cancer, desperate help her. Would tried anything. people prey desperate people moments leeches, human parasites. It‚Äôs awful. hope things work friend, she‚Äôs probably boat right now. Yes, based upon Phase II trial already completed.

Which happened case. Infrastructure week! literally reason lockdown bullshit. It‚Äôs skewed misleading headline attributes deaths covid instead RESPONSE Covid. Unreal. I'm glad they're still job properly despite current leadership (or lack therof). Google studies Comrade.

That's called putting cart wow, phase 3 trial countries count say so? counties allowed legitimate phase 3 trials? allies US?

Let's define ""legitimate"" here. Agreeing COVAX necessarily translate transparent accountable. one 4 become successful, vaccine vast majority planet go for.

That's big IF. Stop arguing troll. Honestly 40+ days wildfire smoke bad go outside probably helped. plus everything still shut weeks ago. fair locking old people inside 8x8 rooms away stimulus tends kill them. lot them. Best hunker focus whatever positive things can.

This whole ""Herd immunity"" foolishness going cause long term economic damage, long lasting effects people get virus prove permanent. effects kind negatively impact productivity produce sustained strain already weak healthcare infrastructure.

Why people think ""wear mask"" = ""lock everything down""? first action keeps spread low enough levels second never look like great option able reach high enough compliance (current compliance US especially dakotas even close high enough) Tell countries like NZ Vietnam actually strict lockdowns life back normal.

Unknowingly spreading flu/covid/hiv one thing, intentionally spreading another.

How get ""suspected outbreak"" without already point already know everyone quarantine/isolate? video still youtube channel

[Can masks protect new coronavirus cough, fever difficulty breathing, wear mask seek medical care. symptoms, wear mask, evidence protect people sick

No mention ""save health workers"", mention homemade mask, mention alternative mask healthcare grade provide protection (like construction mask), etc.

Their presentation say thing, dumbassery CDC early recommendation. I'm crazy cannot read?

Yes, leaders combat clear strategy intended goals. achieve minimizing community many Western countries yet grasped that. lockdowns West physical, they're also mental.

Do genuinely think lockdowns Western countries strict ones China, Vietnam Singapore? People countries cooped homes though.

Also, Western countries like New Zealand, Finland Norway seem running issue. think is? like atlantis, blub blub probably high preexisting levels fitness protecting kind side effects (though absolutely lose Russian Roulette COVID anyway). seriously important question ask given razor thin margins ""best world sport"" ""never was""

You note nations thus far claim vaccine: Russia China, autocracies.

and weaponized. Silver lining Phase III Russian vaccine getting plenty data kinds infection numbers. troop, confirm. So, generally part contract tracing protocol. one person tests positive somewhere, contact tracers gather information places they've get touch everyone administer tests. bars/restaurants/etc meant collecting information part responsible re-opening strategy.

In places protocols strict, might follow approach even *suspected* transmission cases. would work logistically places disease mostly control. broom closets aren‚Äôt full yet, we‚Äôre good. Amplification far slowest part measured time person phones doctor test result gets texted them.

While interesting; novel technique/material would need months (if years) large scale validation (to include running parallel PCR gold standard like viral culture).

You‚Äôre right timing that‚Äôs said one tenth initial rate, account factors would make harder reinfected initially infected. Since 14% cases past three weeks, 1/10 figure cover it. scientists government (EU country) exact thing we're wearing masks like should. 
But, leaders also wearing masks keeping distance, mandatory public buildings, public transit places outside (markets, shopping streets,...) People get fined wearing masks forced leave building. 5 people died: ""fake virus, liberal Hoax"" Im sorry. first paragraph talking France, right?

If so: yeah mostly agree.

France deaths rising abruptly last 2 days, delay might real delay reason. Also France first wave used report past deaths given date... might see high increase day another. canada example follow months ago? happened? mean, stupidest thing need say: let's plan attack here.

[Bangladesh lowest Covid-19 sample collection 24-hour span nearly two date, least 1,101,480 tests conducted country whopping 20.08% infection rate far. 

That indicated testing. Likely lot people died never tested. really don‚Äôt think news cycles aren‚Äôt engineered? That‚Äôs rich naviatae right there. confirm. COVID dead. Adenovirus vector. Oxford one also ran troubles. Yeah jumping joy... fuck owners right? guess surprised shitty people's compliance masks spent roughly 80 hours trying convince wife stop touching face start pandemic. I'm still kind gobsmacked though...we breathtakingly stupid, nothing simple accident we've managed evolve far. ""*See? Zero death! locked country this!?*""

It's sad attitude amongst people refuse wear mask.  study however criticized Common Cold Centre, Cardiff University‚Äôs former director Prof Ron Eccles. said revelation virus remaining active 28 days bound cause ‚Äúunnecessary fear public.‚Äù said, ‚ÄúViruses spread surfaces mucus coughs sneezes dirty fingers study use fresh human mucus vehicle spread virus.‚Äù

‚ÄúFresh mucus hostile environment viruses contains lots white cells produce enzymes destroy viruses also contain antibodies chemicals neutralize viruses. opinion infectious viruses persist hours mucus surfaces rather days.‚Äù

I think opposite actually,testing numbers increased.But problem much numbers actually true.Especially recent sampling scandals like one hard believe anything. 50% americans voted, voted system like that. mean government allowed matter.  Uh pee, get dressed, put shoes, like insult argument something could get today Much like humans way universe know itself, COVID-19 way nature kill itself. actually one times would recommend something like soylent huel. porridge works well Yeah we're certainly going see data least lol Yes. shared five-bedroom, two-bathroom home eight 25 days, report said. relatives wear face masks practice physical distancing, according report.

This pandemic opening eyes everyone's weird ass social habits. WTF? fun for? 25 days sharing 2 bathrooms 14 people? reason believe numbers China America cannot hide massive outbreak China. many people. see upheaval America continual blatant manipulation anything related coronavirus government, numbers suspect. buying body bag story. country erect hospital 8 days deploy shelter hundreds thousands two weeks. credible. happen, likely delivered next day. kids live that! fun way social distance Halloween. wish everyone creative you. agree. Interestingly, however, seem like even low rate new infections, even enough people work, contact tracing real challenge. Finland, looking back last months, one earliest worrying signs second wave approaching reports saying contact tracing successful 60% cases capital, population density highest. words, people infected often clearly tell anymore infection likely happened. Keep mind time infection numbers *very* low, shortage people contact tracing. People's behavior changed back towards normal, however, gave virus chances spread situations harder people pinpoint afterwards.

What I'm trying say contact tracing everyone scared trying avoid infection like spring different contact tracing we're living normal life restrictions. Even infection numbers similar two scenarios, people's behavior patterns make contact tracing either easy difficult.  incubation time? Covid take two weeks infection showing symptoms. 8 phase 3 Studies say Bill Gates knew Covid October 2019

Before even existed?

Let's see source. Checking posting history, expect come one, worth try. said that, definition lie take lot longer.  I‚Äôve trouble understanding positivity rates relationship regular population.

It seems people taking COVID tests either people feel ill, high risk, sort event category (surgery, childbirth, etc). first two categories seem like would higher percentage people testing positive general population.

Pretty much, doesn‚Äôt appear based random sample, rather biased sample, anecdotal thoughts. know people ever tested.

Does seem right, missing something? They‚Äôre effective cloth boot. think density (pop/km¬≤) important per se, proxy underlying social network (real online). Big cities exist reason, good new ideas, fashions etc also good virus. Social circles intertwined far reaching bigger cities. rich bullshit right Mitigates possibility bias could confound study Aligning holes distance, ventilation masks illustration seems imply useless know true. climate misinformation used illustrate true sadly. Correct, World Health Organisation advocate lockdowns primary means control virus,‚Äù Dr Nabarro told Spectator. ‚ÄúThe time believe lockdown justified buy time reorganise, regroup, rebalance resources, protect health workers exhausted, large, we‚Äôd rather it.‚Äù

To say longer supporting lockdowns disingenuous best misinterpretation worst. Died pneumonia secondary COVID? 94%

Died respiratory failure secondary COVID? 94%

Died blood clot secondary COVID? 94%

Died COVID, increased risk Diabetes? 94% http://www.asahi.com/sp/ajw/articles/13336912
The study also found virus initially detected Wuhan stopped spreading Japan March spread strain.

But researchers said coronavirus detected Japan since March genetic characteristics closer virus sweeping European nations rather Wuhan virus. Damn Tuesday, New York Philharmonic announced canceled scheduled concerts June 13, 2021. first time orchestra's 178-year history canceled entire season. high rate fever suggests there's fairly robust immune reaction it. 

Heck, numbers saw then, higher rate fever COVID itself. young, healthy people compared COVID's numbers entire population. 

I'm ruling out, found worrying, that's all. interesting see much larger, phase 3 data, sure. Can? obviously already October masks still mandatory enclosed public spaces? waiting for? Oh waiting case numbers spin control, okay. point knows effective be.

Still can't really blame massive resistance masks people wearing nose/around neck. americans comment literally every article even them? know ego still, getting sad. Hypothetically, lets say doctor save 100 people per day already COVID, save 0 per day get COVID, get COVID mask. one mask left, would say give mask doctor rando street. 

You might say emotional appeal, not. real world instantiation trolley problem. Give mask doctor, saves 100 lives. Give mask guy saves 1 life. Arguing masks given everyone great, simply enough manufacturing lagged behind demand.

When one mask, prioritize gets them. 

In reality, masks. announced spread china constituted epidemic international concern, US government gone 3m told make masks. Make many want pay them. refuse, Defense Production Act asses. happened January Feburary, mid March. allows weeks ramp production time big spike March. Instead, DPA invoked mid march, suitable mask supply early mid April. compensate delay, CDC people Trolley-Problem-ed recommendations allow doctors save lives. good everyone, me. might hard recognize part everyone. mention confirmed cases re-infection 2nd round virus appears worse 1st round.

Kinda hard form immunity exposure exposure give immunity. yet, fully aware we're middle global pandemic.

""Load car kids, we're manufacturing super spreader event!""  karmic comeuppance well deserved, needs held account helping spread disease. infected, assuredly passed family members. Contact tracing must done determine may killed. relevant? intentionally exposed people deadly virus. work matter? data efficacy different types masks. guess data hoping we'd something like someone infected i'm car x minutes, what's chance get infected. would chance one window open, two windows, we're wearing mask, restaurant, movie theater, etc. Michael Osterholm, back July said types experiments said he'd data released August...gonna go look ever released it. Yeah, Surgeon General political fool. mean I‚Äôm think dudes posted consensus looking other‚Äôs post next spring latest next summer behind us. We‚Äôre close think. Pandemics usually last around year too. mom dad would think funny. Yeah, government help support small businesses choose going business fully open covid control measures. Yet somehow seems perfectly adapted letting thousands old people die issuing instructions provide appropriate medical care categorize numbers, seen prior recent investigative reporting. Weird, easily kill people difficult get people stop packing public transport night clubs middle global pandemic. nobody suggesting autocracy here. particularly. trust impartial public health officials like Fauci, think media overplaying underplaying depending political ideology align with. disgusts me. Oof imagine leaving first lockdown, usa usa usa  :( Nationwide Lockdowns, yes bad.

Local Lockdowns slow/prevent spread regions, yes good. live isn‚Äôt much surprise. We‚Äôre new sort lockdown again. announced it. People wouldn‚Äôt listen. annoying. Rapid antigen tests useful testing groups people part contact tracing, good individual results. Actually do. 

Everyone gets mandatory 15-day quarantine within entrance country. Everyone. fake news? say ? Seriously. I‚Äôm you. going happen people reach place hopelessness future, lacking belief purpose make meaningful difference? won‚Äôt pretty. Things get extremely ugly lot country‚Äôs population feels nothing lose. Fever really seem big issue. mostly fatigue, chills, pain injection site, muscle pain: interested see data full phase 3 interim analysis ready. incredibly surprised hasn‚Äôt popped social media contacts, glad saw analyze flaws makes rounds circle haha. 154 subjects asked basically yes questions control sounds good #science work way condoms? Wow. think confusion cdc compiled statistics. 94% deaths INVOLVING COVID-19 6% COVID-19 ONLY. Die cancer also tested positive Covid ‚Äúinvolved‚Äù 94%. Died stroke, heart attack cystic fibrosis...ya 94% Federal Elections total 538 Electors, **2 state** **I attempt influence one those**

Uhhh... Neither true. 4 electors. live Nebraska Maine. electoral votes winner take all.

So, guess, take advice ""feel free explore US Elections Electoral College."" Listen people Reddit find plenty people seen friends family months think that's they're supposed do. Countries taking COVID seriously recognize folly imposing mentality makes people think safe outside homes, many Western countries yet grasped that. lockdowns West physical, they're also mental. Hmm. believe yesterday jumped thread shame guy ‚Äúgetting away with‚Äù small get together...I‚Äôd call alarmist perspective. 

Anyway, seem upset he‚Äôs exaggerating perspective parody...but it‚Äôs difficult many sub tell difference say? genuinely can‚Äôt believe think that. debt going future, many countries longer afford repayments default make adjustments economy (like unemployment inflation) sustain it. It‚Äôs ‚Äúrepressed‚Äù understand money debt rely productive capacity sustained repaid. don‚Äôt want tear world economy thank much, would insanity cause suffering billions. don‚Äôt care fantasy head, would reality.

Please don‚Äôt fucking second suggest WANT kill vulnerable. fucking dare you. global health tragedy. Grow up. mentally retarded. anti mask idiots are. I'm keeping faith man. do, really going away, fully reopen.

If Sweden fully reopened, countries like US definitely fully reopen. Plus, 10 years ago, bitching socialized healthcare. want like Sweden, want actually *be* like Sweden. anyone here, whose someone died due coronavirus. Nope, eyes catch aerosols, too, rinse nose. days accelerate aerosols valves. Omg guys look who‚Äôs back!

Did alt accounts get suspended something? actually decide use whataboutism ? needed, damn shame needed. wearing mask required protect others. small thing could go long way preventing spread COVID-19.

Anyone refuses wear one public places truly selfish. March/April dude keep hope add positive note, puts us beginning 12-18 month timeline stated around beginning this.

Vaccine development moved **fast**. shitshow year, least there's that. true, places aiming eradication right (that think of) New Zealand, likely succeed reopen borders, Australia, place bet fail. need government intervention, restaurants urban areas need almost 100% utilization survive. Stripping half seating eliminating standing room bars solution end sight slower death put owners even debt. way live COVID' continue uncontrolled spread pretending exist,

You: So, want let disease spread murder everybody's grandma, huh? Covid-denying psychopath!

One points article can't productive conversation kind mindset. already set mind alternative lockdowns rampant spread virus, true that? needed lockdowns, Vietnam would outbreak Da Neng NZ would outbreak either. countries probably use mitigation protocols future, that's means live COVID. Americans think living COVID, not, living mass outbreaks.

Meanwhile Asia, developed highly efficient contact tracing system; fast accurate testing protocol utilized still is; built COVID wards stop household outbreaks; realize lockdowns short term solutions made systems deal COVID longterm understand science magic. Civilized countries healthcare systems citizens, would never issue. Every recommendation ""designed manipulate people"".

The general message towards experts ""Admit already masks least something open allow everybody streets soon possible!"" must 1.5yo participate allergy study all? seems like pointless torture. (s)he allergies, keep foods house wait resume study better times. think area people wearing masks try prevent worse outcome.  Looks we're headed bad times. seen 20,000 confirmed cases reinfection.

Well no. confirm genetic sequencing (not PCR tests), unlikely 20,000 Americans virus genetically sequenced even once, much less multiple reinfection rate even tenth original infection rate

Why would tenth? that's lot higher initial confirmed infection rates. would reinfection rates lot higher initial infection rates? 2.7% 2.7%? that's even taking account timing (which would make even lower since part 2.7% literally still first infection NOW). Hate break ya, get lot important compounds cultivating various fungi bacteria. That's nothing new, alarming. create ventilation opening windows doors, using air purifiers, adjusting HVAC systems bring fresh air, use HEPA filters, etc. Even fan help prevent pockets stagnant air, fresh air.

It‚Äôs 2020, technology move air around. first country so? almost everywhere else, even countries political Trump.  comparison very, flawed.  really comparing amount benefit people received near feudal country's economic growth industrial country amount benefit highly developed industrialized country received?

Most world live underdeveloped world. must joking.  China massively grew bottom acceptable livable level people.

Even last decade, quality life still improved substantially big cities China, hardly different cities west. time, things went downhill people western countries. I'm talking fucking Trump rhetoric. I'm talking wealth GDP increase going 1%, like Trump. I'm talking houses becoming unaffordable, I'm talking student loans ruining life. use like that. growth steady, went 1% entirely.

By west, meant US right? gonna say economic growth ""means nothing poverty"", alternative, economic decline (e.g. 08 financial crisis), caused many people lose jobs homes. Media talk Airborne advertisers want people think completely managed.

An Airborne virus cannot reasonably managed indoors, period.

This fact would disrupt every economy planet single country focusing it. much, basically sausage. negative PCR test, they'd tell negative PCR test. means he's still PCR positive. Cool, going anyway thanks

What's end game, here? highly contagious super virus probably going us forever? permanently masked creatures, now?

I'll take humanity let maskers N95s. Well there's difference prolonged ""lockdowns"" calibrated restrictions. course prolonged ""lockdowns"" going cause problems especially third world countries people literally access food medicine isolated. 

I see western world really overdoing lockdowns although Australians pretty mad right now. Basically correlate increase X deaths every % people poverty.

If can't really figure poverty, unemployment despair causes deaths, congratulations, life good. agree non-carers growing numbers increasingly liberal side well sadly No, definitely true. case 'respect' mean thing civilian, IMO. course required like even follow beliefs every person chain command you, absolutely hammered respect (as listen to, follow orders of) commanding officers, otherwise whole fucking command system collapses. military structure based completely hierarchy order, better worse.

You respect titles, experience, positions. necessarily people personally. living virus means able deal outbreaks like Vietnam did. Americans think way deal COVID make magically disappear, expects good sense Americans days? Something like 70% COVID-positive patients reported wearing mask recent CDC survey. get hit car causes spinal cord trauma, causes heart stop, die heart attack getting hit car?

Obviously car. 

If get Covid, causes pneumonia, causes lungs stop, die lung failure Covid?

Obviously Covid. 

Those cases people argue clearly direct result Covid counted such. 

What talking increase rates death linked Covid direct result Covid. cousin doctors appointment scheduled April check skin cancer. hospital canceled procedure Covid. able get procedure, benign tumor actually cancerous extremely aggressive. cancer significantly worse untreated time indirectly Covid. Vote Republicans!! vote back later need be, go right now!! putting money people's lives. Less people = less money, duh!  need now.

Too bad Trump defunded PREDICT two months outbreak. According article scientists isolated new virus every 4 Ah yes, weird ass social habit seeing spending time family. weirdos. claim XYZ millions reinfected therefore rare annoys me. reasons lay out.

This similar ""absence evidence"" vs ""evidence absence"" thing. Currently reinfection rare, knows may found common future? happens, people poo-pooing rare crying scientists organisations ""lied"" reinfections. I'll take good news ever is. idea, necessarily agree with, stop behavior deemed dangerous.
First closing midnight avoid late night drinking (pubs opened till 2am) encourages risky behavior. seen mask rules 1am easily become opinion.
The second problem many cities locals gather specific areas filled bars. gives way circumvent mask requirements since go bar, get drink enjoy outside. would create huge assemblies people wear masks since actually consuming alcohol according law.


A note one. pre-covid times allowed get pub glass beer. new rules gave extra outdoor seats restaurants pubs free starting June. People could enjoy drinks food seated (at proper distance). side effect, spaces extra/emegency solution, rules also made legal drinks outside general.

I using advantage last 5 months, meaning soon group close would move away couple meters stay safe. Others took way form huge groups without need wear masks.

The new rules state behavior forbidden either sit (inside outside) distance enforced table layout served beer already illegal drink inside seated, illegal also outside. tables available, drinks. always liken gun safety. Keep safety on. Make sure gun unloaded. point anything want shoot. Keep locked safe using it. 

I know retired cop taught gun safety lessons followed rules letter, still shot hole wall cleaning gun one day. Give many redundancies possible, realize failures *still* slip given big enough sample size. solid minute thought safety Swiss cheese factories dumb people everywhere world. fair share Australia too.

Let‚Äôs try avoiding stereotypes group population 370 million people minority angry idiots. Yup, came say thing. There's way know many people may actually infected so... Unless vaccines tank last minute. 2020 weird twists turns far. exactly  That's concerning... see counter argument. sub screaming ""Two weeks!"" since April cherry picking cases support sweeping ones rug. üòå entirely. video interview asked point blank protesting dodged question sound bit like sort I'm talking about.

And course ""PPE Zealots, Social Distancing Karens"" 

We plenty stories people freaking someone else wear masks, places like Wisconsin's DNR mandating people alone home, attending meetings via Zoom, still wear masks. 

These stories abound. 

I stand statement. got twice. No, idea long term risks. plenty evidence thousands young people still haven‚Äôt made full recovery months later. plenty viruses crop full recovery years later cause issues. Chicken pox one. don‚Äôt say know full risks virus. estimated 750 million people already virus issues 1, 10 20 years line even larger economic problem then. Someone show Swiss this, second peak ~4000 cases 3 days. He's never said that. said large crowds bad idea. Consistently term never see people using I'm always trying stress folks *Mitigation*.

Nothing fool proof. instance, wear seatbelt drive, still die car accident. I‚Äôve thinking lot. I‚Äôve calling grandmother, regularly entire time watching sinking deeper deeper depression, it‚Äôs making sad. 

If age, 5% chance seeing grandchildren would kill me, would absolutely see grandchildren. Extending lifespan miserable doesn‚Äôt seem worth it. think thin cotton bandanna isn‚Äôt even considered mask wearing one doesn‚Äôt count mask, I‚Äôm example ‚Äúadding ‚Äú
A mask means putting one on, bandanna nothing. sad simple concept requires illustration make even simpler yet still misunderstood many. Solid response Social isolation blunt tool 89 year old woman bone marrow cancer non-existent immune system. Yeah shit aint ending.

Stay fuck inside stop fucking whining dumb fucks. Ah see you‚Äôre assuming immunity life long one catches it. One hope.....
Oh, jab covid 19 pin voodoo doll. think end completely, definitely start calm down, clear whole thing become political USA. election also around time vaccines supposed drop endgame people. Could wrong though. .....whats analogy? Highly contagious diseases widely dispersed currently part global pandemic?

Doubtful.

We get exposed eventually, eventually achieve sort HI. Millions may die, not, depending vaccine. Could large person events contact tracing? would rather poop said 7/11 spend time many relatives many days 1 house together. explain differences like asymptomatic transmission, 14 days testing positive exposure, etc. Big boom So....if kids stroking out...and provided source wrong (you, course, fixed gymnastics us)...think maybe could find another one?

The average stroke age somewhere late 60s. average now, thanks Covid, people 50s strokes. even 30s. way read that. 


You bending article fit claim. stopped still chronic cough I'm saying holding large crowds masks totally fine right? long wear masks geld outside good according Fauci. vitriol comes fact people stupid think masks kind hoax mind control literally killing family members. deserve get punched mouth. 

I don‚Äôt want parents die anti mask idiot believes Trump, obvious moron, people decades education experience medical field. Trump germaphobe. Imagine wasn't. thanksgiving Canada. nightly walks Sunday Monday houses stacked. 

Sure say ‚Äúyou need step up‚Äù, call idiots government nothing it. Classrooms allowed 25 people it, you‚Äôre allowed go sit inside full restaurant. party venue holds 50 people. really stops someone who‚Äôs tired hearing warnings covid. 

We 75 new cases August. expected reach 1000 new cases early week. knows number two weeks time. Need image people nothing. *fully trust* German government regarding Covid-19 raw information, get leading virological experts country Robert Koch Institute (RKI) 'bend truth' suit political aims. Regarding best possible measures taken ongoing discussion Germany, controversial USA.

Speaking which: *not trust* anything American SARS CoV-2, sources mostly biased one political direction days Americans polarized unlearned ability debate compromise.

In end known virus behaves like others (e.g. H1N5) - scientific facts apply them. Contact tracing fast testing? that? Texas. sounds like poor people know fun unfortunately inconsiderate time Dutch tactic! He's 94. think smoking what's gonna get you‚Äôre new user sub then. See, thing democracy ignorance bliss worth much knowledge research, many cases (thanks electoral college) worth more. match data. Sometimes first infection mild, sometimes cases know. strain exactly reinfection would never confirmed since would impossible discern resurgence old infection, confirmed cases different strain. Keep mind differences strains covid big. Rushing make money Hopelessness hell thing. large portion Americans think covid isn‚Äôt really ‚Äúa thing‚Äù, ever growing number additional Americans realizing long first group exists; literally never going end, way life now.

And either say fuck stop caring, pull trigger/tie rope end it.

This just... isn‚Äôt sustainable long term. anyway. Maybe I‚Äôm weak even somehow manage *not* hang next 1-2 lonely Claustrophobic years, constant anxiety, panic attacks, crappy diet, massive decrease exercise, self medication (because doctor says ‚Äúit‚Äôs normal feel like this‚Äù) taken years life. still podcasts featuring experts various fields never common. watched good ones already. Stop trying make contact tracing thing. love little guy still wearing mask. believe actually beat COVID? Trump known lie surround yes men lie him. 

The thing actually know sure get sick. struggling breathe first got White House. could bad case flu one knows certain. get number? want get back normal spring we‚Äôre going need vaccine. They‚Äôre best job humanly possible create safe vaccine. C UK going herd immunity even vaccine. RIP Redundancy built systems layer safety/protection.
On occasion everything lines fails. Whitehorse managed go 8 months one slice cheese (#5). course failed catastrophically. happens lot vaccine development. could well completely unrelated treatment itself. need freak goggles!


preferably swimming goggles, fog like *shitty comparison* That‚Äôs nuts man. guess Swedish govt doesn‚Äôt care citizens? cases like now? 7/11 public washrooms? going bring up. sure general aviation thing, Naval Aviation thing.

I made sure teach guys (maintainers) mistakes happen, long honest mistakes, fix it. fact know mistakes going happen need overlapping measures make sure least one stops mistake becoming mishap. happens rush vaccines.  implying countries forget outbreaks domestic consequences american election?

Lets use (random) numbers good good cloth mask? best homemade cloth masks actually achieved better filtration (79 percent) surgical masks (62 percent 65 percent) peer-reviewed study the¬†Wake Forest Institute Regenerative Medicine published April 

Lets take 79% - leaves 21% remaining.

A 2nd layer defense would need remove 16/21 slightly 76% particles achieve 95% rating.

# 2nd layer: Distancing example:

Lets say virus delivering full load 2 feet... keep 6 feet distance... virus spreads around sphere, means sphere 2 feet contain viruses... 

The sphere volume **\~33** cubic feet

Now social distance increase bubble 6 feet... 6 feet result volume \~904 cubic feet. means virus 27 times space spread out.

So virus load 6 feet **\~3.6%** thats face hugging.

&amp;#x200B;

Now combine calculate result improving Mask N95: 

100% \* 79% (Cloth mask) 21% \* 3.6% (Social Distance factor) **0.7665% Particles remaining** thing is, crazy deniers assembled shut without debate (for obvious logic reasons, mean, flat ear there‚Äôs...). stygmatised without knowing reconsider opinions, took ¬´¬†being shutdown without debate¬†¬ª pride, proof right something going on.

So it‚Äôs matter shutting down, would entrench idiocy even more. It‚Äôs matter education, teaching kids think checking sources information important Look crowd trump rally tell many masks see. That's ... bad.

The key NZ's success delay procrastinate.

Within weeks virus' arrival, lockdown measures implemented rigorous.

If NZ delayed several weeks, case Italy, France, California, etc., NZ would experiencing surges declines seen elsewhere lockdowns would merely slowed things down. timing matters. Literally CDC good comment think Europeans waited gloating.

In addition, keeping *everyone* isolated possible symptoms settle, big variable helps greatly. ten days so, keep sick quarantined. ten days, formula keeps bay. 


The virus doesn‚Äôt go away hardest quarantines. Italy rest Europe eased way quickly too. gives fuck? It;s choice.

Jesus Christ hahahahaha think goes that. know dozens people tested positive including several extremely high risk. know single person point minor systems. know absolutely one hospitalized died it. talking friend situation similar except knew single individual died it. individual 94 years old nursing home. 

This mean take seriously...I like sick still want get covid. see people coming though disease basically shutdown entire lives 7 months even though see extremely minor cases. there‚Äôs disturbance force, forum allowing non lockdown posts! New Zealand defends lockdowns 17 deaths though, cares?
Stop panicking mere case numbers, count seriously sick people post this! Love see someone else thought process! think anyone thread things saying. physically locked inside homes like China food delivery places open.

*Wuhan. Never heard reports happening food delivery places open.

I would say remained countries even health appointments switched onsite virtual.

I heard many countries finding anything people restricted able go outside immediate restrictions still kept place phase hair cuts allowed back CB officially ended.

They allowed majority circuit breaker.

Still seeing anything would make one consider Singapore's lockdown anything strict, especially factor fact migrant workers restrictions essentially still lockdown. Highest deaths since June 10th too.

Actually exactly today (one day latest restrictions) March 24th (one day lockdown 1 announced). What‚Äôs EUA I'm super surprised went ahead international games, knew people going get infected. Ok, country want compare Virus-Death Rate World‚Äôs Worst Among Developed Nations wonder whether vaccine trial halts anything Exactly. probably antigen testing til got 2 negatives disregarded positives.

Why hypocritical harassment trolling? Europe experiencing second wave Italy Europe basically yes. Prime example taking things context.

That could also mean we're looking something similar influenza terms vaccinations- regularly update versions shot protects against, depending long immunity-after-reaction lasts. always nice find China bots running PR. see anything said absurd, really care opinion give single fuck block, mate. saying piece. Treatment May Improve Prognosis Patients COVID-19

Summary:

This retrospective study ivermectin use Bangladesh authors Bangladesh Japan collected data patients previously treated two arms:

- 115 received ivermectin plus standard care

- 133 received standard care

Disease progression better across board metrics - ivermectin vs non-ivermectin:

- Developed moderate respiratory distress - 3 (2.6%)	 vs 21 (15.8%) - p&lt;0.001

- Developed pneumonia - 0 (0%) vs 13 (9.8%)

- Ischemic stroke - 0 (0%) vs 2 (1.5%)

- Required intensive care management -	1 (0.9%) vs 11 (8.3%)	 - p&lt;0.001

----

Clinical outcomes better across board metrics - ivermectin vs non-ivermectin:

- Duration viral clearance, median (IQR) ‚Äì day -	4 (4‚Äì6) vs 15 (12‚Äì17) - difference: 9.78 (8.97‚Äì10.59) - p	&lt;0.001

Pretty impressive! results mean? limitations? go here? Check video details more!  agree, second case I've seen published. would surprised *wasn't* sort variance given many people infected worldwide. ""The sensitivity rapid antigen tests generally lower RT-PCR. first antigen tests received FDA EUAs demonstrate sensitivity ranging 84.0%-97.6% compared RT-PCR. 

Antigen levels specimens collected beyond 5-7 days onset symptoms may drop limit detection test. may result negative test result, sensitive test, RT-PCR, may return positive result."" good message, repost. Yay!

The reason government issued mask recommendations think leads false sense security turn leads less physical distancing staying home ill. also worried improper removal handling might lead increased risk.

I agree think masks net positive based studies I've seen opinion minority among country peers. level I'm afraid wear masks public uncommon. Im curious, hospital full patients sick Covid, let's say way thru ER, hospital turn patients down? someone comes with, say, bursting appendix, happens person? Exactly. It‚Äôs 11 months since start outbreak outside China infections essentially negligible first couple months.

So realistically infected 6-8 months since recovery. far end bell curve resistance drops significant margins say year-and-half two years? vaccination efforts complicated likely extend longer time.

Alternatively unlucky exceptions? Lesson: poor. specify viable therapies, specifically readily applied scale would needed spread uncontrolled measures? use therapies infrastructure treat patients, hence lockdowns vaccine. ok. too. hate fact best use time come with... say that, OP presenting argument harshest terms possible, believe exact thing OP, differing degree.

*Everyone* believes level deaths acceptable preserve economy lives. now, *everyone* perfectly happy let 30,000 people die influenza year. could lockdown social distance reduce preventable deaths, too. don't.

So really input disagreement magnitude deaths willing accept. OP willing accept hundred deaths save family business. willing accept ten. willing accept number deaths. /thread

Why create diseases nature already better job us getting even worse said UK Island(s). US shares borders 2 countries... Trumped Chinese educators really good job instilling nationalism lot don‚Äôt they?
I don‚Äôt believe numbers reported China believe numbers reported America- creative accounting happens.
As reports lack body bags direct report Chinese medical person family home. would rather believe direct report CCP tends varnish truth. another lie? pulling number ass? Agree.

‚ÄúFake news‚Äù. 


Every damn time... seems original sentiment comes Clarence Darrow 1922.

Source: CA fully peaked yet? Every metric dropped heavily since July new interventions. Washington State followed Doctors science. better shape here. people suckered. Fuck dude, doubt even Google. Probably Facebook YouTube amazing far scientists around world come figuring techniques lessen impact virus without vaccine. mean perfect, going rapid pace get even better late next year.

The trick mix vaccinations proper medicine figured get hospitals overloaded(especially ICU's). cross fingers hope get long term complications older. Two yutes Yikes look child eye tell daddy wait line food bank bunch people verge death needed given months live. 1. That's false equivalency.
2. farther get virus, *harder* ought tell came from.
3. We're digital age, tons stuff would paper trails past tracked massive databases automatically correlated.
4. markers whether variant virus man-made evolved.
5. data thus far consistent belief patient zero. idea natural infection could cause long term immunity always wishful thinking

I call wishful thinking. Vaccines prevent infection long time count fact immune response leaves lasting imprint immune system.

I mean, immunity mean virus can't infect cells, right course. one claiming infected make cells immune infection, immune system adapt fighting virus 2nd time around stop infections grow problem.  matter people. ""That obese 74 year old dude made it, I'll make too! YOLO!"" I'm hot Fauci declaring initially masks needed. get reasoning -- civilians compete health workers PPE, stuff like undermines public trust science. initial message masks encouraging home made ones example. Yes Dr Conley, Google says Navy officer. paper logic sound, medical research sometimes things don‚Äôt turn way. 

What zinc replacement bolsters immune system, preferentially induce cytokine cascade may responsible severe forms COVID-19. 

Then might right, however research convincingly answer question. response downvote move it? posting it? another shameless liar /r/conspiracy relies fake skepticism feel smart produce chart all?

The second one, course. He‚Äôs lied so, can‚Äôt even believe doctor, that‚Äôs sad. Unsurprising. sounds like influenza, similarto went 2014 Well it. Much people die treatable diseases cancer virus end. Let's ethical thing.    hell talking about. tremendous blame placed anti mask people. Psychopaths I‚Äôve seen loads posts last days saying ‚Äútest positive‚Äù 30 / 60 / 90 days infectious. 

And this. believe ?

It‚Äôs almost like literally anything lose next election. 

That scares I‚Äôm even US !-( Yeah read scientific studies, unlike :) **You‚Äôre right wrong heart disease link.** looked saw kinds peer reviewed articles. 

As article, may ‚Äúagree disagree‚Äù one. summarize issue it, read screams ‚ÄúStudy finds 75,000 people died COVID official numbers‚Äù
What it‚Äôs really saying is: ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs 75,000 extra deaths, theory caused humanities response virus, others may caused virus directly false negative non existent testing‚Äù Say, starting around 20th? Maybe... exactly noon? use use becoming President example, that's ruined objective pretty much forever. Yeah, podcaster shrooms Post Malone air Edward Snowden month later? don‚Äôt listen podcast him, it‚Äôs guests. Considering cases / likely 15 times officially recorded, possibly. Haha Americans! Brutal. lots exercise programs designed this. It‚Äôs easy find free body weight exercise videos YouTube don‚Äôt require much room little equipment. Exactly Limits inside group size thought talking 4-5 month lockdown. Perhaps pay taxes, offset medical bills. Yet cases gyms, pubs restaurants make less 1% cases. Something seems working right. Opposite me. Take-offs fun 10,000 feet up, able see maybe 100 miles time, thoroughly enjoyable.

But seat conditions leave much desired. political, trump covid miraculously cured election ploy. I‚Äôm sure post going removed like past I‚Äôve said TBH Nothing rapid current testing situation mean question could asked way. would accept hush money rather fight case? really care seeing justice, would accept money talk happened? I'd like little I'd expect. think comment originally replied they'd like expected. mention he's negative Also doesn‚Äôt assume anyone anything right that‚Äôs timeline Q3 2021 isn‚Äôt bad people understand it‚Äôs worst case scenario. Seriously, lurk dude. Yeah. think dived blinds on, know mean: asking ""how minimize COVID cases"", instead ""how balance COVID second-order effects""? 2000 positive, put enforced quarantine- would ok guys?

Ideally, would put quarantine monitored regularly. need medical attention, they'll get one. really understand question here. quarantine ok? getting downvoted? Maybe dont like news? took pretty far today. direct attack ever

Fauci evades attack, counters logic

It‚Äôs ineffective thing happened HIV. Bug parties, etc. think that's called free enterprise... DDT, asbestos, tobacco, glyphosate, etc., etc., etc., might good reasons. thought good cynical people. twitch.tv may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Yeah, ok, blocking now. *measures effective 4 weeks face masks become mandatory fixed legislation, probably within week. mean they're trying postpone many infections possible

[It's Ten years want married home two children. deepest fear virus robbed completely future, potential children life. don‚Äôt work Disney World, I‚Äôm OP. stumbled across thread. still think use term fair game. WDW context thread Disney World isn‚Äôt hard figure means Walt Disney World, it‚Äôs common knowledge Disney World employees called Cast Members. Maybe CM part may little harder figure people unfamiliar it, read original post, really hard infer CM means Disney Worker? Reading again, can‚Äôt even guess else anybody interpret it. posted link source facts, high quality information? don‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm seeing eyes. definitely happening, bus loads, every single incoming base related person - military personnel. testing leave Us implemented recently, within incubation period. military still mission extreme caution protected mission, still allowing necessary personnel come it. 

It‚Äôs piece paper, it‚Äôs followed, like armistice agreements ‚Äújust piece paper‚Äù 1950‚Äôs, yet preventing active war Koreas. 

The US may handling poorly stateside, US military leadership Korea specifically dealt much sooner acted much swiftly anywhere else. One largest outbreaks happened outside one US base gates, cases got base, without community spread. It‚Äôs pretty incredible makes thankful I‚Äôm time. get downvoted wanting something? sub sucks truly GGD Amsterdam advising, need report somewhere direct violation national guidelines stated Lmao bad, downvoted upvote joke. interesting findings look FOXP4. finding anything African Americans, betting would useful look cortisol (stress hormone good immunity/healing), job sector, general healthcare access instead. know people measures can't facts logic, right? understand frustrations, i'm still fighting opportunity well. Could perhaps take online education? keep busy long enough hope pandemic ends graduate. 1. mask protect others. 

2. death long term damages need worry about.

2b. bring home vulnerable family would die it.

3. Shut fuck rest life. Even Trump loses goes quietly, become identity issue Republicans automatically oppose whatever Biden does.

Darwin getting awards ready. Well, wear masks transfer back... 2021 Yes it‚Äôs rough week. Every time vaccine trial gets delayed, every time news reinfection comes out, it‚Äôs really daunting. Makes feel like may never end. Like maybe 3-5 years now, we‚Äôre still reading headlines beat record cases 6 months ago. life on. I‚Äôve lived whole life Which, think, great idea also immediately self-isolate two weeks able safely get tested confirm infected acquired antibodies. JNJ is. serious adverse event halts vaccine review. 

The Lily one concerning working hospitalized patients, hospitalized COVID patients lot serious adverse events. surprising numbers.

Germany gets serious ""50 new infections"" number 7 day span, district, we've got something like 490 districts Germany.

Reporting numbers completely apolitical, reporting national agency founded Nobel Prize winner early last century. Robert Koch.

We're already looking internal border controls, despite we're actually fairly well compared European countries. Yes fells unreal. view map infections germany gets redder redder every day. Everday 10 cities get risk zones here. issue that, places get hard hit start taking seriously, slowing spread, means remote places take even *longer* start seeing major rise cases, people living buy whole ""it's hoax/overblown"" line thinking. blue ones taste like mint. Ah yes, acknowledging people starving killing lockdowns makes ""conspiracy theorist."" Thanks man. I'm trying stay strong. def easy said. Forever? CristianO RONAldo.

It even infected name! ""Infection Fatality Ratio (IFR): number individuals die disease among infected individuals (symptomatic asymptomatic).""-CDC

We get it, basic understanding science. sorry make clear. chemicals spraying everything cause instant intense trigger within minutes take weeks heal.... Gloves protect worn much long cause flare bad. Gloves manageable. also try large shopping's cut time using carts carry stuff rest time. basically win situation one option less bad.  


Not wearing virus. article written early pandemic wish could find again. converted estimated death rate (by age) number skydiving jumps someone would reach percentage day. maybe someone's chance dying covid one skydive per 10 years equivalent 10 skydives per day ten years whatever. gave visual picture something people think of, namely what's chance dying today? US deaths per million 664, UK 631, maybe UK caught recently. USA *way* confirmed infection cases per population UK, UK actually test more, function testing. Listening experts great interests heart. 

They always interests heart. use expertise mislead manipulate, fuck gets hurt.

It's difficult follow line reasoning. spelled out. conclude willfully ignorant. Way cheaper problem continue surviving hosts bats instance come back time, putting back square 1. separate note shocked people sub downvoting lockdown initiative. everyone expert nightclubs... least courage admit it! Sadly, agree... Currently gatherings less 50, masks public transportation (bus, train, metro), possible work home, social distancing (1-2 meters), hand hygiene important rule. Hand sanitizer available almost stores public buildings. 

Some places restrictions certain public spaces people gathered. 

I've tested symptoms. result came within 48 hours. believe around 72 hours moment. Small correction experience b12 cause acne far what's predicted people abide restrictions, really. Both... Swiss cheese model proven ineffective reality it‚Äôs assuming deficiencies aren‚Äôt known random chance stop incidents all. reality there‚Äôs thing chance comes investigating incident always root cause method trace back origin possibly two points failure. Swiss cheese model intended used analogy two items lining create hole still blocked items. Oh go sounds like article assuming 'best way live COVID' continue uncontrolled spread pretending exist, unless indefinitely confine vulnerable people house arrest foreseeable future. Pretty terrible idea, especially since already countries demonstrated possible live COVID also keeping illness contained.

And way non-political discussion keep politics out. Nobody says 'political' dentist says brush teeth regularly avoid tooth decay, drive drunk might harm others, obey traffic lights reason. Wearing masks, social distancing, basic hygeine, avoiding social gatherings, even lockdowns no-brainer situation. Well juncture largely benefitted people's doggies kitties haha  That‚Äôs definitely risk, jobs. 

1) Security - Prohibitions non-citizens working it. probably increase time goes different governments cracking copyrights/patents concern. 

2) Convenience - Easier everyone call together you‚Äôre nearby time zones. 

Permanent WFH probably won‚Äôt thing COVID control. it‚Äôd wise organizations maintain flexibility WFH next pandemic crisis. even employee benefit. U.S. Australia reasonably close obesity rates. difference mortality disproportionately higher many times over. knowing half battle!! Alternatively, would already idiots would've caught died rest us stayed inside like two weeks let pass. heard go away weather warms up. disappear, like miracle.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* likes words fake news.

I'm confused. apply ""group people"" ""someone else""? ready twist. 10/10 100% agree still sure well masks work.

The exact numbers irrelevant. Whether 30% protection, 96%. long higher zero (can't even say ""much higher zero"", cost/effort wearing masks low). 

There's reason hedge here, except shame initial message incorrect.

And incorrect due honest mistake. intended manipulate public.

""Listening experts"" great interests heart. clearly always interests heart.  purpose lockdowns flatten curve overwhelm hospitals. virus going away.

What want people do, stay masked lockdown forever? ‚Äé11 57 States Territories Participating

But us mean lot uses already significantly benefitted humankind, miracle cure COVID. he‚Äôs learned nothing he‚Äôs still voting Trump. may feeling like pos giving two family members died, can‚Äôt real remorse he‚Äôs still backing man responsible lies, misinformation, politicalization virus inaction administration. article say think says deaths indirectly caused pandemic camefrom illnesses¬†such Alzheimer's disease, diabetes heart disease Sacrifice nursing homes kill vulnerable early look better time goes on? talking Taiwan, Korea, Singpapore, New Zealand, country sacrifice elderly name misguided ignorance? always lesson? 5000 good compared 20000 50000 even 200000 bull shit. Even measures taken disease still spread. Shit like hurting helping people. actually big fan Khan going election thought he'd great city. feel he's totally let voters down.

There really interesting article Times ago, talked realisation politics hitting man start totally evaporated. 

He's completely useless - multiple failed vanity projects, lost promises totally cut decision making city, moans complains, dug ditch (or far na√Øve). put perspective, 1 30 people Iowa tested positive. 

About 1 2150 total Iowans died it. 

They sitting 1.4% death rate positive tests.

Many still take serious. Iowa republican. lol that's get international games middle pandemic Someone must ""non-concerning"" reaction again... worries though, next super-human qualify trials anyway. Synagogue demagogue? answer, conclude point. Americans struggling even handle #1 ""freedom"" culture cancerous leadership Republican party. verify true. sent us back. mention, know, originally praising Xi, banning China, us likely getting COVID Europe use cheddar, holes almost it. idea flattening curve almost part problem though. Washing/desinfecting hands shit corona. Tho good general hygene. again, you‚Äôre failing understand end result vaccine here: needs better outcomes compared standard care, standard care COVID *sucks*. swine flu vaccine debacle ridiculed virus contained spread, spread vaccines would seen life saving. Jesus Christ absolutely makes difference. Switzerland comparable population NZ visited 21 million people 2019. Yup initial issue correct. Ventilation systems key spreading virus, rather specific air intake vent air output vent, bringing air ceiling less likely contaminated key diluting existing virus. We're also going employ huge whole house fan sucks air room 4 minutes. viral load. want reduce chance concentrated areas around infected people much possible. animal testing Covid vaccines

*gets immediately proven I'm saying animal tests What's point exactly?

It's difficult follow, it. know dumb though. Maybe they'll come coloring book explains it. I'll keep posted. want want global shutdown 2 mos never going happen unless want armies shooting people sight violating it. They'd shoot whole bunch people too. Relevant XKCD: (You even got 200 right...) thought ok win FREEDOM!! wisconsin supreme court ruled mandates unconstitutional!!?!!1jii9089 got argument someone Trump sub-reddit asked question multiple times ""What Trump done minimize spread virus entered country"" go think travel ban China big step (which know bullshit). said pointed dishonest question hahaha. can't even answer done minimize spread cuz he's done jack shit People less likely coronavirus social distancing measures generally low rates infection population. 

Think it: let run riot non-vulnerable population vastly increases chance person hands food prescriptions COVID, collect food someone COVID they're much likely get COVID themselves.

Until self-sterilising drone deliveries, trying isolate vulnerable simultaneously create herd immunity non-vulnerable population mutually exclusive. virus live surfaces touch.

Or airborne particles land hands.

This isn‚Äôt difficult comprehend... germaphobe, poor-phobe Fearmonger much? 3k week 3k-per-day? WI, 3k-per-day last week days high 2900s per day. small town grew three thousand people yet state clocking three thousand new cases **per day**. Shakin damn head... CDC gone way releasing official mortality rate, know right? That‚Äôs keep saying table isn‚Äôt think is, crackpot sites like Breitbart getting comically wrong.

So please keep reciting numbers don‚Äôt understand don‚Äôt even confirm original first claim anyway.

And get it, roughly 300,000 Americans died can‚Äôt possibly care less. debate public policy ...that doesn‚Äôt involve politics. Completely nonsensical. Man sure moved goalposts quickly. People always use non-scientific arguments politics. illegal live park car street 48 hrs. matter vehicle current tags parked front residence tagged to. guarantee scientific data back idea 48 hrs long car street. arbitrary number people agreed on. There's probably really scientific data says parking cars street bad either. People use non-scientific arguments politics time necessarily bad thing. physical distance part worst hardest part, won‚Äôt achieved enforable. sneeze release 200,000,000 particles. 0.7665% that's 1,533,000 remaining particles deal with.

Coronavirus faces 100% inactivation around 132¬∞f.

1,533,000 * 0.0% (132¬∞f heat inactivation) **0 particles remaining**

Therefore putting mask distancing, go light fire. you‚Äôre saying wash hands? social distancing /s

This genuinely boomers view science astounding me. Wow bunch ads. self-promotion. way. used judge friends eating it. Like, guys, it‚Äôs rotten titty milk animal. It‚Äôs got nonzero amount pus sometimes (virtually time, since milk gets combined.) Yes. It‚Äôs gross. race isn‚Äôt even well suited digest (Chinese - didn‚Äôt grow eating it.) tried approach open mind early 20s enjoy it. 

Thing is, make sense people eat it. used think fucking random ate spoiled excretions cow mammaries. But, no, it‚Äôs random. 

Grass plentiful certain biomes wasn‚Äôt otherwise food rich humans. What‚Äôs good way survive situation like that? Try convert non-useable/inedible yet abundant resource one that‚Äôs directly useable/edible. Enter: herbivorous grazers convert grass something edible: meat dairy. Instead killing golden goose meat, people kept around ate milk. What‚Äôs great way store milk pre-fridge days? Let go bad controlled way. That‚Äôs cheese. Still high calories nutrients. Better dying. Better expanding species otherwise not-food-abundant areas. 

I realized hate cheese ‚Äúgross,‚Äù hypocrite, I‚Äôd also hate fermented food - bread, sauerkraut, kimchi, kombucha, beer, miso, yogurt, list goes on. 

I‚Äôd also technically hate nutrients I‚Äôm able absorb gut thanks gut flora breaking food eat me. I‚Äôm fan malnutrition digestive disorders, I‚Äôm happy appreciate lot diet essentially foods allowed ‚Äúspoil‚Äù - gut, food manufacturer‚Äôs controlled conditions. Swiss here. Switzerland don‚Äôt call Swiss cheese, instead Emmenthaler ... that‚Äôs originated, Emmenthal valley Canton Bern. brakes, headlights, air bags seat belts seat belts save get car accident? What's point exactly?

That wear mask? 

That anything lied several months ago? exactly trying say. SARS pretty serious business. Aggressive contact tracing early prevented blowing up. Anyone looking sweeden good thing funny, like purposefully stupid what? live life normally since we‚Äôve bombarded protect 80 year olds living borrowed time anyway Yes yes. Oh Full disclosure, watched doc ""Out Time.""  newsflash..he doesnt give shit   refuse call anything miracle drug. understanding mechanisms works, can't possibly predict negative side effects. Look way cheese sort of-‚Äú also known defense depth. It‚Äôs common principle makes lot sense many applications security epidemiology. It‚Äôs strict measures haven‚Äôt seen larger outbreaks. sucks everything works well seem extremely unnecessary top  use designing sterile packaging (for med device). Using tyvek creates ‚Äútorturous path‚Äù, it‚Äôs similar this. many spun layers HDPE fiber microbes get stuck die penetrate fully. Really cool stuff. what's lied 'a virus let Chinese'?
Based.on evidence exactly world came conclusion virus spontaneously decided hold world hostage?

[Scientists still know sure Spanish Flu world thinks know covid-19 invented someone?
People continue call want wear mask whatever reason stupid.......or call say virus thrown world human(s) conspiracy theorists.

Even 100 years Spanish Flu killed millions people still know started.....but world 2020 seems think know Covid send world months discovered?

Only fools led fools buy this. report 12th 888 968 total cases (the ""Casos totales"" column), compared 9th 861 112. difference 27 856, number comes - ""almost 28k"" - however total includes test results backlogged previous days added last 24 hours; could 2 days, 5 days, week ago. 2825 quote number cases diagnosed previous 24 hours. words, one fairly meaningless number vs another, one right? Neither! garbage. Madrid particular ""creative accounting"" shall say get cases 500 per 100k people political Yeah faith leadership able things properly.

Even Hong Kong death toll 105 there's little virus community, keep fucking letting infected people go old folks homes infect everyone there. unbelievable. heard mom Utah. Someone called local radio show claimed one stories, old guy knows told one, except nursing home asking family permission put covid death certificate. (Wait death certificates filled nursing homes now? since family tell doctor put?) get it, thought least help society long run targeted super spreader. 

It‚Äôs like healthcare it‚Äôs worth going bankrupt going doctor. Atm maybe also brigading effort anti lockdown sub. Maybe recognized posted something like downvote everything (i think maybe someone Python knowledege uses Script API). idea me. bother. heavily targeted like comment - time mostly handle it. also admit post ""china"" matter Info get very, fast downvotes (some need 1sec). Idk happens like said bother. Virtual Points (karma) 

Stay safe friend take upvote honestly see something similar happening family. annual reunion August: something like 40 people four states one wearing masks. One cousin went days posting pictures partying Florida without mask. Another cousin decided take kids across country visit dad cancet keeps posting pics together without masks. big Christmas thing planned see reason skip it. Many made fun boyfriend skipping reunion one got sick. bad thing actually lost TWO relatives COVID early on. also lost someone boyfriend's side still think big deal. Stop dick, know believe. Everything Russia, usa china Seems like Corona really dislikes word ""lakhs"".It stopped increasing right hit 100k.

IMO,This ""Flattening"" curve seems artificial anything else.

On hand,if turns anything ruse,we finally shush naysayers sub. care someone know.

idk

significant other's family TN, uncle actually, caught like horrible movie. all, wanting catch disease that's killed million people 6 months wearing piece cloth face minutes day *so* inconvenient brain-dead stupid. 

Besides, COVID-19 virus mutate. coronaviruses common, infect many people every single year via different strain. matter time people start getting infected new COVID-19 strain (if current re-infections way already). take unnecessary chances middle pandemic? necessarily. got tested received treatment soon found without treatment cdc recommends 2 weeks 100% sure infected anymore. symptoms even show least 2-3 days. Trump tested positive around midnight 1st 11 days now. 11 days + 2-3 days waiting symptoms = 2 weeks means found earliest possible chance without tested everyday past months. assure you, you, president, anyone else would want do. Actually think China great job stopping spread COVID western governments taking issue seriously.
Hell places don‚Äôt even mandate face masks. nothing race would even bring up?
China lot dead bodies start Spain Europe nations.
Areas place ran body bags issues that.
My country lied this, country lied point? Seems like Corona really dislikes word ""lakhs"".It stopped increasing right hit 100k.

IMO,This ""Flattening"" curve seems artificial anything else. Lol ok don‚Äôt understand people think wearing mask makes ‚Äúsheep.‚Äù someone explain rational mentality this? old people die it, okay, #1 don‚Äôt want get sick #2 don‚Äôt want grandmother dying ‚Äúeconomy saved.‚Äù god, folks would get taken first. \^ checked, WB seem bad here. slowly rising tho reporting around 4k cases day.
Active cases around 20k. Dr. John Campbell YouTube story almost 10 months. Still getting much traction there's money made global pharmaceuticals. burr seems like he's shit line, make Yeah, popcorn always run out. We're still pretty well.

There's nightmare ""deal with"" contract COVID twice year - hope end one bad cases! - thing next 10 years.

But, I'm guessing winter bad. existing human coronaviruses slam hard winter, like 40x increase severity read once. So, anything order magnitude, get virus afraid January.

If bad winter, know, think everyone move medicine keep roll barrell russian roulette. running stages parallel. cases, unlikely hospitalized:

 looking caseloads West Bengal worst comparitively. _unpossible_ test, contact trace, quarantine, reduce infections time. works.

The problem many Western countries many infected impossible trace many people contacts. simply practical.

You can't rule another shut down. still need shut reduce overall number something traced. means shutting overall infection drops point team contact tracers track quarantine community infections.

I mean, need really shut down. Everyone, business, venue, shut stay home 4 6 weeks. Enforce it. open back phases, maintaining masks, social distancing, limiting crowd sizes, limiting on-site work. follow shut key. Come greenville worse. moved avoid paying lot money rent. bad. People give fuck whereas near Dallas saw everyone masks Maharashtra's peak 25k+ cases/day.
It's around 10k/day. Yesterday state reported 7k cases.

Tamil Nadu's cases also falling, although much slower rate. However low numbers touted prove reinfection ""rare"" low cases confirmed sequencing. amount un-sequenced likely reinfections quantified way useable scientific evidence, anecdotes flooding in. people ""think"" before, People tested positive testing positive recovering. suggested Chyna strong amazing.

Well, said [ninth wonder Well, yes, New Zealand low infection rates. Europe would vastly harder time making Korean model work. Wtf? people suppose wear mask rest lives? Lol math.... ten days new cases lay street. Add Maharashtra Tamil Nadu list too. One reasons vaccines faster new type. read somewhere trying find back source link. I'm pretty sure british website. rushing sure also new type apparently. something people do, wrong lockdown, [but without mask gonna get Kerala, Karnataka West Bengal. guy fired cause. I‚Äôm worried thanksgiving. *My family went cautious May, thinking level precaution crazy*

Statistically speaking they're right, presuming younger 70. literally almost people know work speak (in democratic state mind you). real mentality huge portion regular ass people. Honestly dumber rocks willing admit it, something trump revs engines. know lot people said ""I want get stop worrying much, stop wearing stupid mask"". *seriously* irritates me. Thank reuters headline wording! everyone thinks ""antibodies"" always good. ""antibodies"" also cause auto-immune disease. antibodies good. think forget sequencing done study build evidence reinfection.

Nothing science, especially medicine, static. sequencing provided evidence, it‚Äôs much reasonable clinician decide probable reinfection.

In words, sequencing important continue learn immunity/reinfection. However, it‚Äôs really close relevant ‚Äúconfirming‚Äù anything anymore. We‚Äôve ‚Äúproved‚Äù it‚Äôs highly probable happen. !RemindMe 35 days Seems like Corona really hates word ""lakhs"".It stopped increasing right hit 100k. Yeah samples discarded people tested. someone tests positive later would assumed residual fragments first infection.  Even person became symptomatic there's clinical point proving reinfection since treatment infection reinfection identical. Sorry loss, friend. Mind telling 3 states talking about. favorite events Doomsday crowd try name shame social gatherings social media (i.e. Sturgis) prepping ""I told so"" spike hospital overflow. 

Except never happens LOL.  Culturally Taiwan South Korea quite different country colonised UK. Yes well Fortnite friend said death count overblown CDC reporting Coronavirus type deaths COVID deaths well known reported even described CDC website. asked show where... lotta nothing.

/sad true story complete denial understand eventually need accept fact everyone get virus. 

a virus like never ""perfected vaccine"". Lol ü§£ America know days old agree you. FDA absolutely politicizing this. I‚Äôm fan potus means I‚Äôm sure FDA isn‚Äôt either, probably won‚Äôt approve one election. don‚Äôt want give benefit doubt. It‚Äôs fucked BYU Idaho, 100 percent LDS (no one non LDS would live Rexburg). tuition 2,000 semester.... Perfect response. Please, lets start calling like is, people murders. willfully spreading disease eventually find host kills. 

What's worse, continue push Barrett nomination, avoid helping American population survive pandemic another 50k, 75k, die spend time rejecting people this. Rather exercising power serve needs people. Traitors, one all. Numbers going literally everything opens up.I believe it. they're special something terrible ever happen must fake (enter long conspiracy theory) kinda felt like timing planned. reports started coming reinfection, initial shock pandemic still heavy. Now, we‚Äôre pandemic fatigue cycle. stay fight flight long. think they‚Äôre hoping pushing now, motivate people compliant heading Winter. Yep, years ago hospitalized pnuemonia caused cold strain, human metapneumovirus. paralyzed vocal cord makes easy things get trapped hard cough out, leading things like pnuemonia. üò≠ take professional purposes? photos personal, somber reminders something! show meme? Everything society founded science. look science made much possible. find surprising. One bat virus strain give humans, ok. Virus get human different species back humans new threatening. news? check excess deaths see massively reporting. SHIT Ugh means longer I‚Äôd see paper, including stats specific initial test. guy sore throat diarrhea could well false positive initial test got actual COVID instead they‚Äôre calling severe reinfection. 

I‚Äôm still cautiously optimistic reinfections run rampant certainly we‚Äôll see number infected climb things reopen more. friend's sister posted meme learning anything science class... classes learned lot. chose learn, guess. basic biology chemistry... fuck country.  Business insider credible media, mate, full click bait, false misleading information/headlines, trust/use/quote/reference/touch it. proves point media Australia messed up.

Same event documented ABC, published see difference actually read them, one full manipulation lies impartial true. bet want see want believe, really pointless talking you. Actually, inferred something similar initially. However, saw theory complete opposite. scientist felt worse disease progression could actually sign body producing neutralizing antibodies potential resulting cytokine storm represents immune system‚Äôs last-ditch effort, even fault.

Short answer: don‚Äôt know yet. However, worse disease doesn‚Äôt necessarily equate immunity. feel like point Fauci say opposite feels Trump take advice. think way, likely make happen. Chances avoiding slim, means impossible. careful next years, might survive without infection vaccine perfected. serious ‚Äî call Shirley. least prayers save Probably gonna go winning finals even call science deniers. Reality deniers Feel free add ""intelligent"" list. take serious first time? confirm, trust us. China pandemic. Two unrelated issues. Kinda like ask immigrant children cages turned them. Oh, way, practice began Obama, Trump. course, Trump takes credit everything likes. lmfao there's many interests play globally locally. already cure obesity. People willing take it. That's u.s back summer spring beats isolated apartment alone rest life.

Recently gran started flaunting restrictions honestly? Can't say blame her. Demanding spend last years life isolation 'save' hard ask. speak highly! deserve happy guy, amazing!

I'm sorry died, Im sorry loss. America, we're taught anything want put minds it. possible way, population density much higher, Copenhagen basically connected Sweden Denmark crucial transport connection central northern Europe. refuse get healthcare. live San Diego go Tijuana regularly meds. let greedy assholes take money. lockdown. Take pick. can't believe Trump actually beat Covid. It‚Äôs overwhelming hospitals. talking point debunked repeatedly. Remember Navy ship hospitals? used.

And yes, understand everyone young healthy, doesn‚Äôt matter. doesn‚Äôt justify shutting society justify forcing masks. There's evidence covid started spread Zimbabwean bats. doubt collecting guano requires contact bats. Well first, established structure deal upcoming 4th wave, means less possible deaths wave would go quicker.

Waste money? Considering established structure deal 4th wave found cases would‚Äôve lead infection resulted stats safer reopening. imo isn‚Äôt ‚Äúa waste money‚Äù, though agree it‚Äôs overspent level I‚Äôll classify ‚Äúwaste money‚Äù

Oh also, say blues would voluntarily go test. really confuses yellow didn‚Äôt want get tested since that‚Äôs basically worsening ‚Äúwaste money‚Äù situation (overspending situation) saying gov shouldn‚Äôt waste money. another pandemic comes along nobody learned anything go back shit doubt catching COVID deaths.

Someone happy hypoxia dies, heart attack stroke corona virus. test corpses COVID-19. still hot AZ. Phoenix still triple digit weather. replied, thank kind words. supportive family &amp; good friends. carry weight &amp; miss her, well. Thank &amp; take care &amp; loved ones. Awww nuts Could worse. years, people probably embarrassed even say cervical cancer, let alone let know last ditch efforts. cover cost care loss business resulting shift focus treat COVID-19 cases.

my point was: would moronic ""all Covid deaths made hospitals got paid extra it"". many hospitals cancelled elective procedures months Covid first broke US, chance they'd netting profit scheme, major source profit already completely cut off. Speak yourself. You‚Äôre one compelled create new Reddit account order plaster sh*t opinion everywhere. snowflake, f*cking cockroach? stopped watching/listening JRE first couple Covid talks guests. Normally care difference opinion large public base, incredibly reckless downplay global pandemic like did.

Really soured view liked always pretty neutral/open minded divisive topics. smash mouth concert Bunch scholars there. Even without COVID fuck wants spend 8-25 days 14 family members house 5 beds two baths?

Sounds like hell fun. Bingo. dropped /s Yeah, one. thats thing, dont know cause deaths were. possible many people misidentified covid deaths dont know. would actually inaccurate title call indirect, pretty safe say regardless whether covid indirectly, probably result pandemic general.

You literally upset accurately worded title doesnt fit narrative Fines reduce number people break rules, obviously, potential rule-breakers know caught. original plan defeat ISIS claimed tell anyone unless elected later interview announced murder families?

He got criticism that, think stopped announcing plans, implemented killed lot ""civilians"" aka family members. created circumstances virus flourish municipal, provincial (state) federal levels, particularly respect three pillars society: healthcare, housing education. Add way environment abused, capitalism run amok unchecked along overall deterioration morals, values concept community.

I think we‚Äôve ‚Äúsitting ducks‚Äù years. 

I worked non-profit sector HIV/AIDS (and thought game then!), SARS conducting research 2003 Toronto General Hospital epicentre lockdown. also worked University Toronto 2009 H1N1. 

I‚Äôm loss words point. anyone supposed news like this? don‚Äôt even bother reading stories headlines like anymore. get pieces shit. Let‚Äôs focus cure redeem ourselves. Thank chuckles! suspicion people get reinfected 1st whose initial infections mild, hence limiting extent body‚Äôs immune response. Therefore, it‚Äôs likely second infection severe relative 1st. speculation right now, we‚Äôll data reinfections future, unfortunately. surprising, though: rules generally need enforced. Asian countries like South Korea fining violators COVID safety rules since beginning pandemic. Government 101 stuff. Yeah, probably 100% right. It‚Äôs cold right tho..? Yeah, native californian immediately occur winter would preclude outdoor dining gathering much country. think might end ideally poised weather storm think handled much better us. mom liked Bad Santa apparently feel like said due public pressure time he's saying Texas right way went put way comedy show come back brag maskless. Bill Burr thing too, think Bill roast said ploy get Bill riled sure playing long-con.

I'm positive general still way he's handling pandemic pretty put character thought thats disappointing little bit.

And forsure time lot unknowns like said cautious, like always says listen though. think fact NY hit early turn *major* factor high death rate. Doctors March April know much treat virus, *lot* improvements since then, terms drugs (like dexamethasone) general treatment protocols (such using less invasive methods giving people oxygen, opposed using ventilators).

Then there's policy forcing care homes accept people virus (contributing 40% deaths), overwhelmed hospitals high levels vitamin deficiency expect northern city majority non-white population end winter.

I suspect number people infected NY course summer rather February, March April, would half many deaths. fewer. Yes perfectly fine that. fear several hundred thousands die? Let‚Äôs stop taking precautions allow million die. love Ireland. year ago week, seeing pictures year ago today make sad want go back! Everyone Ireland damn nice (an American traveling solo), countryside breathtaking. That‚Äôs wrong. supposed inject it. Duh. power next Summer, even Dr. Fauci said we'll vaccine get back regular life Q3 next year.  drive side Sioux Falls it‚Äôs far man  kids I've seen kids die go trick treating. FIL treating wife like trash since decided distance take seriously. I'm expecting epic blowout tell coming Thanksgiving Christmas. That's point. point people getting positive results twice. almost cases, never sequenced first positive result. So, test positive again, told youre shedding virus inactive.  
These cases rare actually saved samples months ago sequenced new samples yielding two separate strains mutations. rarely get sick last November sick took months felt better. Felt like truck chest everyday would force breathe finished marathon . believe virus around lot longer reported mislabeled influenza deaths. thoughts people lied thru pandemic. Correct. 4th wave shortly. ‚Äòuniversal testing‚Äô baloney waste money. It‚Äôs meaningless now. gov soon find another way mess like exemptions quarantine. talking about? üòÇ done pretty much standard help tracers. Tell 0.16% new york state already dead Oh hahahahah thought Major\_till's change insanely low IFR. 

Meant something like: even though CDC includes ""overweight"" risk factor, overweight person's IFR compared remains healthy weighted person's IFR. 

They saying IFR overweight people still considered ""insanely low,"" despite fact technically higher number. Indeed, overweight people large fraction population, IFR cannot far insanely low ones provided, sampled whole population.

From article billionaires saw fortunes soar $434 billion nation‚Äôs lockdown **mid-March** mid-May, according new report.


Like, know say mate. read post? said exactly number (from poster) cherry picked come back whole bunch numbers cherry picked exactly way. article says 5 reinfection cases worldwide, BNO tracking reinfections lists So, symptoms last initial viral infection? So... Complications? Calling ""long Covid"" seems bit like hyperbole case, especially since article says lingering fatigue &amp; even new/unique Covid. guy u arguing moron ""Counts deaths recent weeks compared historical trends (from 2013 present)""

That's searching finding article. So, they're comparing year average previous 7.

It buried ""Methods"" Oh Damn. sorry hear that. Wishing well government doing. Oxford back online, US, week iirc  I‚Äôve DVT flights. got another clot lockdown. :/ I‚Äôm sorry Yeah seriously. buddie thought might accidentally infected whole family got test. one week later make sure. Smart move think. Literally none top commenters read fucking article looked misleading headline.

The article states 75,000 Americans died **indirect** causes pandemic undiagnosed cancer, economic hardship, lack care, more.

But sure, go ahead skip straight ""muh excess deaths"" conclusion without even reading source. fucking hope everyone attending get infected point. saying cancer ranitidine, someone leukemia taken ranitidine almost daily +15 years, I‚Äôd much prefer odds COVID given choice.  sums up. defense mechanism. given understand it- broader demographics start allow, better vaccine doing. People worship Harleys tho really think that, maybe reconsider many died credited covid death died something else? Cool dude. 

I manager one nation's largest treatment facilities whatever. Incidental.

No way 40 million people unable support families would spike short term substance related deaths.. create long term mh crisis convince father ""low"" numbers denmark (400 cases day) increased lockdown restricitions actually good economy society whole?

How overwhelming consensus among panel Ivy League Like Kawasaki, compared too. oldest person Kawasaki like twenties. won‚Äôt know get much older. 2/4 benched.

Pfizer moderna still on. death cults insanely vile immoral Amazon day tomorrow, Black Friday, Christmas...can blame 2021?!? sounds really stressful hard. wonder many people living much pain think normal. Yes released China hurt US economy also simultaneously hoax invented Democrats hurt Trump's chances winning reelection. literally uncle believes. 

He believes families paid 30k per death place death ""Related COVID-19"" death certificates. 

the logic thinks 11k people died COVID, 204k people fake news... makes budget 6.15 Billion USD (Billion - B) ""Fake"" deaths.

That much money, idc, cannot move without someone noticing government noticing - remember: GOP runs branches government atm. Yes. Deception also virtue them. enemies truth enemies American lives, stop nothing force suffering upon people. Fuck, another one... ...okay? say does. According article analyzing case.

Just like Aztesca, trial may pause US.

That means 2/4 major trial hold. good odds.  People refer Aids epidemic vaccines discovered, though science lot better now. Decision maybe strong word it. ineptitude, indifference, denial route left herd immunity. see downvoted either.

There's strong scientific consensus climate change rampant human population growth, pandemics expected become increasingly frequent severe. surprise go social distancing masking inconvenience someday future.

This reality world we're heading now. fair though, pandemics probably would lesser worry (unless something akin smallpox arises) compared everything else warming planet bring.

Not related covid. that's something know, shingles awful worth knowing. Meanwhile, south... many vaccines game right now? bench? source surge known? Sturgis rally mid August I'm thinking probably it. 


If increase amount testing percentage people test positive increases, trouble. South Dakota gathered people know, unaware masks protect others. still ‚ÄúThey said masks won‚Äôt protect us,‚Äù ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt temperature, I‚Äôm sick‚Äù mindset. frustrated along you! Lmao that's interesting stance take. saying /s meant *knew* article nothing deaths due virus? turn around blame Whitmer taking away unemployment. question many deaths prevented vs prevention efforts caused. 

There's little evidence suggest spike deaths caused lockdowns every reason think spikes deaths due spikes COVID. See examples parts long thread Botttttttt least I'm anti-science, unlike you. speaks approach educational system takes - teaching test rather teaching individual critical thinking skills. son's math classes joke really teach mathematical concepts=, rather shortcuts enable higher standardized test scores. need drastically reform educational institutions. 80% people past days live. 

It's ramping steadily past week. Dutch people went restrictions even announced it. point knows work. let come point. carefree summer, everybody Europe basically watched infections slowly surely increased time. point got serious exponential increase does. hope late. June 2021 minimum date set months back. people, even given option, would pretty happy least 50% WFM, especially people commutes, least according internal survey. companies actively funding home office setups long term, becoming productivity neutral.

I still miss seeing coworkers, I'd pretty happy 3 days WFM, 2 days office moving forward long got keep home office equipment. need see every day, something in-person meeting actually serves purpose to. ‚ÄúMonmouth University located West Long Branch, Jersey Shore.‚Äù Enough said.  puzzling. close social contacts people culture (on average), easily virus spread around.

So people greet hugging/kissing even relatively minor acquaintances 10 minute conversation close together greater chance passing along virus people likely nod wave distance exchange couple sentences.  People get together large family groups vs groups 2-4 similarly increase chances spreading it. live alone one two others vs large/extended family household. 

When comes exponential growth, even relatively small cultural differences (whether natural culture imposed due current pandemic) make significant difference time. Looking deaths alone tell story consider common car America. Wow man arrogantly ignorant, worst kind. don‚Äôt know, you‚Äôll learn. Again, point COVID worse pandemics is, point novel influenzas also dangerous minimize that. minimize COVID comparing tuberculous AIDS, every life precious, right? see said lot regards COVID, think people really mean it, nice thing say.

What I'm saying pandemics equally terrible. terrible ruin cause minimized. reason NZ's success could similarly achieved entire US entered lockdown simultaneously. 

What achieving Taiwan's success (borders closed), Germany's success (hospital infrastructure), China's success (mass testing) South Korea's (test, trace, isolate)? US need like NZ specifically?

Again, country locked simultaneously followed guidelines afterwards, plans set motion future SPH orders. Let's even go whole PPE, testing contact tracing blame science pretty much regardless whether NZ US.

Having poor leadership make science useless reality science human deserving blame. Plenty people able follow guidelines despite Trump.

People capable surviving without food shelter months end? that's happens people get money need survive. Again, NZ counter COVID threatening people possibility mass homelessness. US government even pass second stimulus check. due respect, brother likely wrong. Don‚Äôt despair. 800 calories hour. get put in, generally kick butt try keep instructor.

Every recommendation ""designed manipulate people"".

No. every decision designed manipulate. Some, even within realm medical treatment, inform person believe best course action is, believe that. attempt deception. attempt change people's minds religion belief system, personal desires contradict course action.

It's called ""informed consent"". Go read it.

""You need mask"" (translation: probably need get one, people want masks get theirs) manipulation. Pretending bullshit. need asshole. lmfao. yah riiighttt School work restricted. People advised keep social circles tight prohibited contact households. also allowed go buy groceries/food exercise outdoors. no, unless those, asked stay home 18 hours day. far seen, measures seem serious, enforce people adhere rules. doubts that, really hope slows spread otherwise know else left done. Reddit decided would 7 layers ""MASKS"". Sadly feeling that's good track piece paper saying US military forces follow requirements. reason believe followed. words, US military simply follow agreement, would Koreans know? 

You cannot simply believe agreement, military honor it. also piece paper saying US military personnel tested negative shipped Korea. 22 US troops catch covid? I'm fan

So like rapists? evidence transmitted hands/surface? Turkey fudges numbers. could self correcting problem. -_- classic *gun back head*

Always been.  china lying...sorry guys. see Great Wall photos? seriously comparing new Zealand China? Jeez.. Killing boomers best way get housing, care protecting group people wish deny us affordable housing education. home grown ""big brainers"" too. tend loud idiots. Nono. world watching US, cartoon goes name ""Trump"". test positive Tuesday symptoms Monday bar, everyone quarantining/isolating said bar close contact with. 

I see need song dance testing 50 people know could spread there. Particularly since Day 2 infection I'm betting rapid tests even 85% accurate. think gyms open necessarily, people act surprised people upset years this? sports gym activities really sucks huge mental physical health boost. Hypothetically, lets say doctor save 100 people per day already COVID, save 0 per day get COVID, get COVID mask. one mask left, would say give mask doctor rando street. 

Yes. say philosophy class problem answer wrong, get C- class.

When actually line (or children), keep mask yourself, doctor that's 3 states away dies. him, he's far away impact personally, math simple.

Even willing let people charge play games like this, willing figure one people saved doctor, one people sacrificed live save others. named specifically sacrifice, duty society let might say emotional appeal, not.

No, quite possible one uncommon individuals completely bought ""termite people"" theory humanity we're one big hive mindless things valuable individually.

I'm one one mask, prioritize gets them. 

And justifies lying people? least came right said it, could admire honesty. lying me, broken trust us consider everything say might lie. Even innocuous things... could information future threats, things innocuous all.

By lying me, treating I'm even person. I'm machine that, pull correct lever push right button, wish.

And like treatment all. makes us enemies. means justified destroying systems, reducing influence nothing, treating would true, genuine enemy.

And understand get this. Maybe do.

Maybe get think don't. Ladies gentlemen, recently appointed king America. It‚Äôs true wrote it. Oh really, live listening see reddit? China cases, south korea caught 8 passengers china tested positive COVID-19 airport. Damn that‚Äôs f***d RoK, RoC, Vietnam, Thailand, Mongolia. think Birx still there, hanging Uncle Joe gets elected. honest also big questions effectiveness cloth masks, hurt, wear it? Maybe works better think. little downside wearing mask. hand, properly worn surgical masks quite effective limiting outward spread. shorten time left.

Why send card instead? much covid19-denialism Czechia totally pure, versus influenced friends, things read, things friends read, things friends think genuine feelings versus swayed paid influencers (bots people)? Wait hear ceasefire deal Taliban US got nearly forty combined years war. Well, science needed able tell consequences possible decision might be. Scientists might say ""if X1, Y1 happen. X2, Y2 happen. X3, Y3 happen. Well, least that's assume likely thing happen case.""

However, many cases, 3 possible outcomes Y1-Y3 things undesirable. Maybe Y1 kills lots elderly people pre-existing conditions, Y2 crashes economy, Y3 possibly leads long months years fun parties people might suffer mental issues lack social bonding.

Scientists able tell 3 options X1-X3 best. Something sacrificed case can't put objective price tag / cost different kinds human suffering calculate option leads less suffering. Everyone judge things differently depending experience etc.

So end, political decision made. applies many things, Covid. US, decision generally favors party currently holds power ignores ""other party"". countries like Germany, coalition parties need find common ground maybe decisions bit balanced thanks that. Yes. They're gross imagine Canada, told us 2-3 years. That‚Äôs vaccine. gather mean everything people home (which frowned upon am) going concerts conventions etc.

My brother doctor said isn‚Äôt vaccine coming, doesn‚Äôt matter media says. way everyone comply masks distancing definitely happening. Honestly sorry trying stay positive last 7 months it‚Äôs waning things don‚Äôt seem getting better. said nobody asking stay home 18 hours day. That's incorrect, currently case Canada. one documented case re-infection us that‚Äôs 7 million confirmed infections last 8 months. Everyone freaking needs chill fuck out. trials passed, that‚Äôs super normal expected. means process working intended solid 60 seconds convinced explaining Swiss cheese mask would work gotta keep mind around 80-85% cases asymptomatic

Considering CDC's best case estimate 40% asymptomatic cases, would love see getting 85% from. go u/Dankyouverymuch7 oh sure, insurance ""voluntary"" country surprise medical bills make homeless insurance. freedom choice. get it. anecdote valid doctor's data. I'm sure people losing family COVID dealing doctors totes fixated reddit right now. confirmed genetic sequencing infections, extremely rare begin with. personally know someone got sick covid twice months apart, doctor wasn‚Äôt particularly surprised either, course first infection wasn‚Äôt sequenced saved it‚Äôll never make publication.

Edit: need know confirm reinfection rare many individual cases globally gotten virus genome sequenced. haven‚Äôt seen number anywhere imagine it‚Äôs small relative number infections. keep sand ears? Ive never understood. asking tracked show reinfection

See, seems begging question me. *is* important, epidemiological perspective, know common reinfected completely separate source original infection. I'd say even *more* important know common *overall* someone relapse long time initial infection, whether that's due reinfection return original infection. people dying relapses, small consolation they're technically reinfections. that's tracked someone's job. countries never, coutries wait Netflix serie. help there's new CDC report study going viral says number people wearing masks contracted COVID wearing masks. Guess kicker is? P value 0.86. Stupid high. people believe like gospel! even people going take masks now. can't believe live vile idiotic people! say religious people can't let politicians it? Cult leaders gunna cult. Yeah, criminal negligent gang chief Rutte, kept testing capacity 30k. last 2 weeks increased 40k per day. great read. Thanks! Wow, can‚Äôt wait see RCT results.

It's sensationalist, makes news non news. extremely political rather science-backed info (shout r/covid19)

Eh r/BoomersAreTumors anyway Without Ronaldo... last time checked, virus needs hosts stay alive, makes host symptomatic ten days. guess science fallacy though. 1) talking long-term issues:

2) DOES, however talk range issues, right longer-term ones like strokes seizures. Lol thank you, wanted say this. Peeps really stretch ""science"" Oh see, concern-trolling. actually seem invested undermining safety measures is.

Your bizarre misinformation reasonable. see past comments know exactly diagram showing, I'm sure pretending don't. company work still trying demand let phones. could set system people food *in* home.

What country know policies &amp; infrastructure place able massive test detection cluster cases/relatively cases per population? anything right...their government knows people breaking point - let people enjoyed well deserved outings (since actually followed rules lock right), keeping (government's) hand quarantine button.... think EU moving second, maybe less deep lockdown country country.

Sweden also one reliable reporting. times overreporting countries lot excess deaths counted. 


This seen as; know data countries accurate. know data Sweden accurate. 

Of course gonna look worse accurate. calling someone R word frowned upon since possibility increasing number would actually form mental retardation? urban cycling heavy environment

Exactly. everyone lives Boston Manhattan. Shit I‚Äôve DC area 5 years I‚Äôve heard (and seen another time dude drunk idk counts).

All done year shut wait vaccine that, us realize now, might never arrive.
Option b turn China, nobody wants either.
What options left otherwise, honestly? Discrediting responded way worse covid crisis every single one neighbouring countries? Cool guess Vietnam entered chat. Who‚Äôd thought 21 people energetically exercising room would potential risk? like, literally. I'm mistaken, affecting poor educated people much because

1. lack scientific education makes prone listen public health advice like masking washing/sanitizing hands frequently

2. probably malnourished deficient things like vitamin d, correlated worse outcomes contract Covid. Aaah. I‚Äôm Texas, near Houston specifically. used ahead WV testing, seems nobody wants talk rankings thing anymore I‚Äôm sure stand. combined yo-yoing openings counties see mask mandate friendly suggestion, kiiiinda sucks here.

Holy shit, country lost. *If* willing assume populism appropriate way make decisions govern plenty people tell wrong. Governing purely science practical humans behave predictable ways. shut NY months? live NY? many people think would actually obey restrictions march them?

The biggest fucking irony considering New Zealanders freedoms since May. bad people suck 2 months follow simple guidelines like wearing mask follow social distancing.

One guy told governement faked cases making map cases/100k inhabitants. 


For example 20 cases 10k village would show 200/100K. convinced governement uses 180 fake cases make numbers. course idiots post facebook, know big exactly group is. knew feature would problem? think worth noting belgium test lot - im pretty sure percentage positive tests also higher. numbers even higher results show.  Wasn‚Äôt July first person? think Americans ones whose economies ruined this? course world leaders want this. wrong. Grow up. going away, fully reopen. way ""live"" COVID. assume ""living"" means resuming normal life hiding house kids N95. contact tracing measures literally excuse invade privacy.

Look Google, Apple many different retailers. Theyre trying trace relation everyone else phone. one's asking stay home 18 hours day. They're asking follow guidelines hosting large parties congregate overcrowded bars. They're asking wear mask whenever possible indoors crowded place. minor sacrifices anyone *truly* cares country staying open. ""cheese""! view deaths like communist countries critique? I‚Äôm surprised. many died COVID thinking it‚Äôs big deal, it‚Äôs hoax worse flu. 
 really feel everything right infected someone thought scam. Ag nee man Jaapie.  China, talk virus government-controlled social media, messages get deleted, account gets shut forever, may invited local police station talk nice officers.  science. Pretty close together days. Look president is.... Look what's emphasized. ALWAYS NEVER. implying non-mask wearers somehow less susceptible catching virus. think lied number covid infections US? flu infections?  insane country manages mess many different ways.

How even possible?

Swedens future looks grim. belgium mandatory mask use lot places we're even worse. feeling ignorant people country spreads. 


The winter though time countries. 


Belgium today much hospitalisations day went lockdown. decided sports indoor 12+, lockerroom showers. University homeschooling caf√©s close 23H. 


I fear 2nd peak longer worse first peak amount people getting sick. (i think deaths lower beter knowledge). Nope. cycled years urban cycling heavy environment primary transportation I've never seen heard person. Preferably fish batter! replaced 7 masks work(ed) event industry mainly DJ, stage tech decade. Every single side hustle came last 10 years almost every bit income made derived mass gatherings. 

I count number gigs I‚Äôve since pandemic started one hand half zoom parties. don‚Äôt think industry coming back least summer next year - likely 2022. colleagues friends artists, photogs, stage techs, promoters, stage performers, etc taking massive hit none us know even industry go back keeps up. They're stage 3 stages skipped merged together. know everyone reminding us stay calm, normal, especially accelerated timeline on. please sensitive fact people reasonably freaked out. path powers America put us on, vaccine last- possibly only- chance *contain* plague, let alone end it. even entirely different leadership going next January, that's still months. situation even control. People watching trials feeling like next decade life line. Uh, sample size 154 patients...unless I'm reading wrong. Also, people lie contact tracers masks 100% effective, that's 6 feet distance \*also\* important. Look places virus basically gone, like New Zealand. shut shit down, stop people moving goddamn place, reopen.

Let's use US example. Trump (or even Biden) says total lockdown 2-3 weeks. reason allowed leave house get food grocery store, delivered outside building arrive. Borders completely shut. Police every corner enforce lockdown.

How many people think would actually obey restrictions march them? No, we‚Äôd isolating young people respiratory conditions (severe asthma, cystic fibrosis, COPD, etc) heart disease. slightly overweight isn‚Äôt going get government provided housing services plan  site accurate. Put postcode correctly says tier 2, Area Info says Pubs bars must close.

No 10pm mentioned, whish correct am. meme originated. right wing publication Federalist put spin article Educational twitter thread statistics, vaccine trials, know trial complete: Might numbers mixed up, world population approx 1.6 billion time, 'suspected cases' spanish flu 500 million. scientists testing vaccines, work? instance assuming wanted test 1000 people. simply give 1000 random people vaccine watch happens? once, give different people differently days? I'm assuming people get placebo? many 1000 get that? vaccine trial ""pause"" mean? companies searching vaccine way? competing other, share information? meme? seems data science-based assertion. Discounting data actually anti-science ironically. know accurate knows, could be. one, per CDC. Probably still better safe sorry wear mask crowded areas guess may masks tend give people false sense security perhaps? America #1 words, worlds largest pharmaceutical manufacturer. whats difference one vaccine others? equally good safe? You‚Äôre making absolutely fucking sense. Dr. Fauci testified Congress stated large gatherings. includes BLM protests political rallies.

People attend political rallies taking risk attend BLM protests. choosing spite known risks. Fauci consistent stance large gatherings whole time.

To make argument one type gathering perfectly safe another gathering complete recklessness total utter hypocrisy. Noooo Sheesh Ok what‚Äôs theoretical risk 45 year old who‚Äôs slightly overweight? (Hint, you‚Äôre going need decimal multiple zeros) Even ignoring post-2016 monomania CNN always failed present kind technical scientific information accurate complete way. care selling ads turns spewing nonsense perfectly good way that. I'm sure difficult can't imagine saying words, ""I'll see ya later guys. got spin class noon"". nuclear industry uses model well. defense-in-depth. dumbest thing anyone‚Äôs responded far I‚Äôve following since January. need education hope get soon. air-tight, respiratory droplets coronaviruses much larger oxygen molecules Ironic best schools America far away better anything NZ. Assuming someone went ""lowly community college"" differing viewpoint... tolerant. ever heard sound human body makes gets T-Boned car going 40mph?

In order. accept virus taking years life even don‚Äôt get sick, stay home getting continuously weak pathetic add that, many workers probably live Tokyo, since common people commute numerous cities close (of prefectures). Companies almost always pay transport costs full timers, living sound economical choice. also get hundreds millions people something look forward dark times.  Lmao ultimate cherry picked comment! Make sure vote Britain: Hold beer. ""0-19 years: 0.00003

I‚Äôd like read myself. True... commenter pointed out, 0.28% entire population (of New York) died already, IFR can't 0.28%... right?

If total number infections New York less 100% population, 0.28% population died, IFR *must* greater 0.28%. I've able get test within couple hours without symptoms. six far since beginning June. negative, thankfully. lot tests gotten due contact tracing/being around someone tested positive. (I live Copenhagen) lol get Fair enough, can't claim know anything time scales respect mutations leading observable changes, particularly species. I'm virologist (my specialty bacteria) evolutionary biologist, all!

I think bring another interesting point considered, actually, that's opportunity cost maintaining immunity pathogens (via energy requirements, etc). That's...interesting! Would interesting see investigation general, related covid, idea would even go determining something like that. probably particularly pressing knowledge, could get poor schmucks PhDs I'm sure. Lol. basic scientific thing could make poll ask people whether trash curbside annoys whether noise pollution night disturbs them.

Florida hits 2 weeks since Ron Desantis declared end covid restriction mask rules

florida today +1870 new cases. \~90 deaths (7 day moving average).

florida two weeks ago 1882 cases. \~103 deaths (7day moving average). Sooo no, make big difference. Cases deaths continued trend slightly downward.

lockdown/mask loving People's republic Califorina 3114 cases 66 deaths yesterday. no, lockdowns make difference

Source one stopping practicing religion like christians muslims sikhs others need abide social distancing guidelines put place. religions switched online services outdoors limiting number people allowed inside one time. religions across globe, can't they?

Then try touch face half hour.

Thanks job BTW. Yes easy country 300+ million people. Smart guy. mean?  Belgium, squadron virologists warning government past 2 months. government absolutely nothing cases started exploding, then..........


..........relaxed measures. Yeah.

It help one said virologists outspoken communist, Facebook reason call whole thing left wing hoax. really wanna compare global agency like Reuters niusdiario owned mainly Berlusconi/mediaset companies makes it, per se, right wing biased source since still also top tier Italian politician.

I know need journalist read data you, need data make mind. time read journalists aside daily events opinion making usually specific dossiers investigative journalism. think killing anyone okay. Everyone working elder care/ hospitals obviously vigilant. still think lockdowns absolutely useless since many 60% asymptomatic carriers. impossible eradicate unless naturally burns out. goes on, do? ban travel shut business? choice instituting crippling lockdowns extend life largely unhealthy, old people year condemning children die, saving 6000 children per day 5 preventable death (and protecting vulnerable people extent) lifting lockdowns, morals guide former?

That‚Äôs selfish non-compassionate thing I‚Äôve heard. Common sense tell go spin class pandemic.. ya know! weights boxing bags outside. rude. I‚Äôm US. I‚Äôm curious, would Parisians even follow curfew? climate like there, far adherence guidelines?

Eventually, going peer drapes rest world going business wonder safe. close drapes mutter ""better risk it"" think meant say is, ‚ÄúREEEEE‚Äù I've already explained it. else do?

COVID like ebola kills everyone comes contact clearly everyone's good. Let adults talk without input. clinical background bleating ignorance world. Antisemitic. How? Cause I'm Jewish. following social distance guidelines, selfish. thought pass one really really wanna leave, pass next one Uh-oh. good.

100k+ additional deaths. people would get vaccinated regularly. wouldn‚Äôt bother. death count would higher usual next couple years you‚Äôd probably see masks everyone would go pre-COVID, large gatherings all, nobody care anymore. I‚Äôve seen covid-deniers avid sports fans, post WSB, think getting back simple lives consuming served restaurants important thing they‚Äôll ever do. 

Oh yea, (but all) LOVE current president. mean, sure, never got low case numbers, pretty obvious US approaching third peak. 

What cause peak come back down? sure. Maybe post-election get stimulus package allows stricter social distancing requirements limp us across beginning vaccine implementation. (Which invariably cause another spike people think that's blank check whatever thry want do) Except isn‚Äôt happened. March, available evidence suggested masks generally available public little good coronavirus. wasn‚Äôt lie, ended accurate data US places like Italy added.

Also said, shouldn‚Äôt wear mask, didn‚Äôt low risk, going to, wear right. went explain part advice masks know work short lie, evidence base decisions compared March. Remember doesn‚Äôt work first doesn‚Äôt mean scientists lieing something called research Fyi, learned ago ""rat"" historical insult Jews. Fievel Mousekewitz coincidence. I've stop thinking annoying Jewish woman know, never remembers anything acts smug like idiot, ""ratface."" published data literally claims supports average age 30-40 covid stories. 50 young? hell going here? I‚Äôm word without, I‚Äôm bending bias? one word changes application -15 years. 

Meanwhile, bent young adult 50 year old person. claim 30-40 isn‚Äôt average literally average whole article linked about. It‚Äôs average established based upon sample size. 

So bending words mean something else, definitely way flagrant here. rest article aligns interpretation. numbers align interpretation. 

Nothing aligns interpretation. Mocco would re-iterate data confirmed beginning article. 

For me, seems pointing another trend noticing hospital. would re-iterate data already establish table data? re-iterate it, re-iterate data incorrectly math shown. would that? Contradict range 30-40 years age? based interpretation. trying ration already limited resources. easier tell people buy masks ration hospital staff ration across whole country. 

Telling people ""fuck you"" government sources manipulated situation productive. entire purpose subject matter experts manipulate situations good. 

Electric motors designed someone saying ""How manipulate magnetic field changing electric current good?"". Vaccines invented someone saying ""How manipulate body's immune system good?"".

In opinion, best interests heart, rationed masks all. Instead, would said masks perfect preventative measures. would caused run PPE leaving hospitals scalpers enriched. reminds Chewbacca defense lmao Oh yeah definitely. UK definitely relationship-driven work work offshored.

## Abstract

### Background

Ivermectin shown inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in-vitro, led off-label use, clinical efficacy previously described.

### Research Question

Does ivermectin benefit hospitalized COVID-19 patients?

### Study Design

and Methods: Charts consecutive patients hospitalized four Broward Health hospitals Florida confirmed COVID-19 March 15 May 11, 2020 treated without ivermectin reviewed. Hospital ivermectin dosing guidelines provided treatment decisions per treating physician‚Äôs discretion. primary outcome all-cause in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included mortality patients severe pulmonary involvement, extubation rates mechanically ventilated patients, length stay. Severe pulmonary involvement defined need FiO2 ‚â•50%, noninvasive ventilation, invasive ventilation study entry. Logistic regression propensity score matching used adjust confounders.

### Results

280 patients, 173 treated ivermectin 107 without ivermectin, reviewed. patients groups also received hydroxychloroquine and/or azithromycin. Univariate analysis showed lower mortality ivermectin group (15.0% versus 25.2%, 0.52, CI 0.29-0.96, P=0.03). Mortality also lower among ivermectin-treated patients severe pulmonary involvement (38.8% vs 80.7%, 0.15, CI 0.05-0.47, p=0.001). significant differences extubation rates (36.1% vs 15.4%, 3.11 (0.88-11.00), p=0.07) length stay. multivariate adjustment confounders mortality risks, mortality difference remained significant (OR 0.27, CI 0.09-0.80, p=0.03). 196 patients included propensity-matched cohort. Mortality significantly lower ivermectin group (13.3% vs 24.5%, 0.47, CI 0.22-0.99, p&lt;0.05); 11.2% (CI 0.38%-22.1%) absolute risk reduction, number needed treat 8.9 (CI 4.5-263).

### Interpretation

Ivermectin treatment associated lower mortality treatment COVID-19, especially patients severe pulmonary involvement. Randomized controlled trials needed confirm findings. President Trump least [alluded

The title article says deaths 'from the... pandemic'. That's misleading. That's excess mortality is; total number deaths due crisis You‚Äôre comparing two years less one year ***so far***. stereotype loud, uneducated American far predates 2016 I'm afraid Spanish Flu lasted approximately two years... we‚Äôre done yet. trust still early stages know 3% virus actually is. Better catch possible..  Schools: one these. everyone sees obvious. Armenian protests 

Hypocrisy like not?

Because needed results people destroying property shits giggles? They're trying get social justice save lives, want break shit. last flu season also unusually low Denmark included early 2020. similar pattern seen elsewhere Europe, least northern. However, Denmark hit corona, i.e. restrictions introduced. country's flu season late Sept late April, vast majority deaths usually Dec early March (winter 2017-18 exception relatively bad season, partially year's vaccine poor match flu strain ended hitting country). first COVID-death 11 March, i.e. around time normal flu-season's high-death period stops. One argue ""cheating"" using statistics period first COVID-death already minus due unusually low flu-deaths earlier (Jan-early March). However, even removing earlier period 2020, Denmark still fewer deaths normal. beginning winter's flu season Denmark hopefully south hemisphere no-flu winter repeated north.

Another factor suggested Denmark's low deaths fewer accident+car deaths, Aug (Sept numbers yet published) they've quite normal: higher 2018, lower 2019.

It appear fairly limited restrictions introduced recently stopped corona-rise happened Sept, cases hospitalizations appearing stable slowly going down. Even ""harder"" restrictions used spring-outbreak (March-April) relatively mild compared many countries; lockdown people worked home schools shops closed, stay-at-home order. fast reaction people following rules evidently help.

There additional factors. example, Denmark testing much earlier authorities estimated initial spring-outbreak (when seriously ill healthcare workers tested) actually 4x many daily infections current. So, infection curve appears worse spring, number hospitalizations much lower. Additionally, higher percentage getting infected last couple months younger, average age hospitalized lower. Fewer hospital + treatments available + fewer hospital old = fewer deaths. deaths old people, low numbers middle aged, extremely low young (indeed, single person &lt;50 years age died, 36-year-old man April). bandwidth humanity? ""Here 500 hours YouTube videos *prove* brainwashed media!"" Touch√©. knew Trump actually deathnote! Go comments, several links study cooperatively worked on. I‚Äôm really sure else put this.

Big /s here. reach peak sometime November back 2-3 deaths per day Christmas. They'll fine. China want ruin economy. difficult understand lol. Indeed Yes thank you! Like read cdc website people real numbers! 6% deaths COVID-19 *ONLY* Stop evil then. Jesus, what's wrong you? Seniors in, trial site metro area Germany recruiting right now. high school friend Facebook watched YouTube video said Covid deaths made hospitals got paid extra it.

All obviously exaggeration fact hospitals classifying deaths covid deaths been, article isnt actually talking people dying directly covid saying number higher what's examining death certificates, study found than¬†150,000¬†deaths officially attributed COVID-19 during¬†that period. researchers¬†determined nearly 75,000 additional¬†deaths **indirectly caused pandemic**,¬†bringing total number deaths four months than¬†225,000.

I guess boils opinion classified covid death. Meaning person avoided going hospital get something checked (not actually covid) died going in, ""covod death""? covid didnt directly kill person, indirectly lead decision ended death. $1T?

That sound right given much economy would shuttered order handle correctly.

Also, whats death toll handled correctly? alone may $1T analysis. name Lonnie Norman. say ""like""? Thanks. think. Maybe. Sigh.... struck emergency order allowed extension unemployment benefits. health orders (masks such) still effect. happy restaurants closed employees can't get unemployment? map absurd. NY state largest number tests per capita US. super easy get tested there.  read comment! I'm sure see reason inflammatory. Obviously number going different geography geography due demographics, prevalence pre-existing conditions, factors yet understand (potentially climate?). Anyways, claim ""the IFR 0.13%"", claimed recent estimates I've seen put general range, one low end 0.13% (the study). number seems unlikely outlier low end.

I quoted 3 quite reputable sources. Unfortunately, order understand IFR is, need understand denominator equation. by:

- Estimating total infected worldwide sampling set population, by

- Performing experiment, insanely unethical proud country bad thing. baijiu (hard liquor) would kill virus, stupid people believing eating spicy hotpot would burn germs

would nice true stop fucking evil changing say? Seriously, that‚Äôs fucking evil contributes misinformation spread. referring fact says similar health department order change.

What's point cutting unemployment without fundamental change restrictions? like think ruling well anyone flown recently US? experience? show symptoms get sick after? Feel free show example Chinese citizens allowed protest government without repercussions. I‚Äôll wait here.  norway, fewer deaths far year previous years.

Whoever scared virus free go personal lockdown. theoretizising much immune differences men women, look hygiene measures viral dose may order. misinformation. I'm saying told us back March wear mask. That's thing he, past tense, did. Obviously, he's telling us wear mask since time that.

Literally never argued that. realize whole comment chain started someone claiming Fauci said masks ineffective, right? That's lied us back he's playing sort political role.

What lie exactly? Asking symptoms wear masks based fact taskforce warned PPE shortage fact **no one** knew high degree asymptomatic spread then. I'm seeing established fact lied wearing masks.

No, established fact advocate everyone wear masks based knowledge COVID point. What's lie again?

You keep bringing lie would one **if Fauci ever said wear mask work**. source showing instead told us wear masks back then, lot people would lived.

You realize Singapore gave citizens advice Fauci? masks recommended high asymptomatic spread proven?

The difference Singaporean government quickly established mask mandate gave masks citizens. Mask uptake close 100% within day mandate officials never downplayed disease led example.

The fact accomplished US due Trump. recommend masks moment CDC changed guidelines? refuse wear masks public? scrap plan distribute masks every American April? 

Those Fauci, success Singapore proves bulk blame lies administration anti-mask day one. CDC isolation protocols best have. that, every doctor public health dept United States uses. standard everyone covid positive told. people world right including coworkers, customers stores, grocery store clerks, delivery drivers, etc. given requirements leave isolation. guidance based research updated time reflect latest data. 

So much people going hate politicians going back work soon, following protocols cleared doctors, perfectly fine. still wear masks, however, right thing do. I'm board wearing masks. Unfortunately, federal mask mandate, would hard enforce. ""Oh, died covid? well health issues""

a consistent negative relationship found relative humidity cases. Overall, decrease relative humidity 1% associated increase cases 7‚Äì8%. Overall, found relationship cases temperature, rainfall wind speed. Information generated study confirms humidity driver SARS‚ÄêCoV‚Äê2 transmission.

\[referring study 2010\] Temperature relative humidity affect coronavirus transmission, virus survival (at lower temperatures coronaviruses survive longer) length time infectious respiratory matter stays suspended air (at lower humidity material stay suspended longer).

\[[Journal Virology Flu seasonality\] Relative humidity change size composition virus-carrying respiratory droplets. lower relative humidity, salts respiratory droplet may crystallize leading lower salt concentrations better virus survival. Less water vapor air also result evaporation water respiratory droplets, leading smaller respiratory droplet size. Smaller droplets may travel hang air longer. droplets may higher concentrations live virus well.

[As Short Communication *International Journal Infectious Diseases* virus first gets respiratory tract, worse infection may end being. Therefore, respiratory droplets tend higher amounts active virus temperature humidity drop, resulting infections could dangerous.

Again, issue public health advice theoretical v real world application. many others understand personal views virtually consequences. recommend someone know something respect public health likely widespread effects. global, regional, national, municipal public health authority makes recommendation effects serious. may advise one individual speak explain nuance thoroughly necessarily advice give whole populations. asymptomatic spread bs, backtracked one LATER, heck even aerosol spread recent.

Long Covid thing, Covid does. not. last. that. long. say Covid long ""long covid"" also plain false, covid long, weakened damaged body caused Covid19 infection.

What seen past places like Florida Arizona little concern things get bad testing hospitals getting overwhelmed. northern plains states could New York unusually vigilant. conducted Australia, yes. **autumn** season especially relevant northern hemisphere now. Almost like bad idea bring people entire country state. Yeah. likely Spring early Summer. Viral pandemics take year slow down. Plus, vaccines really stamp control spread good. There's new Federalist spin article making rounds social media stating caught COVID mask wearers.

The article links CDC pdf July I've trying find discussed avail. sad thing indication next US president, matter is, willing join global initiative. definitely sub competing viewpoints days, good thing IMO. couple months back, anything pure doom-and-gloom got instantly downvoted shit, lot BS articles made top uncontested. That's much less case now, many comment sections actual discussion instead circlejerk. Apparently understand better can't correlate countries completely shutting longer USA, problems businesses shutting down, less deaths, almost Covid free point. good signs, see India's curve, gonna keep going considerably. states finally getting things control, apart 3 states cases rising exponentially

Death rate also seems dropping. 
There's still long way go, looks like India's much better couple months ago. masks ready use, kept car. difference.

Believe not, care; first question doubt me. real. Doctors know real, that's name it. I've read, 10-20% people contract COVID still debilitating symptoms months later. Given many millions people contracted virus already, huge problem get larger pandemic goes on. don‚Äôt. say March never say confirmed. large majority getting funding/approval it, setting actual trial up, getting people sign etc. 

That stuff 'rushed' sense health organizations putting backlist approval like trials, nearly unlimited funding means set trials practically instantly 20 times many people looking data happens normal trial, allowing things 1-2 days would take trials months. terms 'rushing' actual vaccine?

Another recent study (that go find requested) showed - surprise sad see data - women color least believed medical professionals expression symptoms, especially pain I'm happy government held accountable following law. Maybe next time they'll right way. actually correct think whole country denial. going second wave it‚Äôs going ugly. Isn‚Äôt also possible false positive test first time around?

Wrong, Spanish flu killed 50 million, doubt billions dead time over. Mostly fine person like written rules lowly americans permitted speak. guy replying threw hissy fit, pm'd threatened Doxx me. 

And he's shocked anti-mask, knuckle-dragging idiots world get looked anyone IQ higher dog's. know getting downvoted. Anybody watches football would agree ssme message still? talking point. talking article posted. Yes exactly. realize Lockdown measures love much caused ton death right?

I hope day look back reaction realize disastrously dumb was. then, copy paste 'mUh ApPleBeEs' bullshit call grandma killer. Fucking idiots. Frustrating people really focus ‚Äúfear‚Äù. afraid wanting safeguard health? also try eat right exercise snort cocaine cross street without looking. life/health literally world truly mine afraid wanting keep it? virus us forever, that's sad reality. It'll become fifth endemic human coronavirus. We'll learn live it, learn live flu.

With said, life likely return normal next summer. politicians obviously, American people put so... Cognitive dissonance helluva drug told there‚Äôs reason afraid Covid you‚Äôre 65 generally healthy.

Is wrong? Considering really strong musician's union, conscious choice made musicians board. city saying can't play June 2021, amount planning setup goes putting professional orchestral production tenable assume wing situation improves.

Plus, like 50% NY Phil attendees easily age 60 (and data shows big spenders donors even bigger proportion), so...  Nobody looks forward meaningless internationals, look forward club football getting underway again. pointless (and dangerous) nuisance Good argument, well formulated.

To address points made edit: archives headlines many news organization show backpedal mask. Never mention shortage primary cause public. matters, people use N95 grade part.

The change mask guidance result 3 primary factors. first evidence much asymptomatic spreading taking place. known early part reason recommend widespread mask wearing. Second, making public health recommendations would foolish say yes, wearing surgical masks obviously good need reserve healthcare workers taking care sick. many people adhere advice they're useful, greater good use them? better say less cases, e.g., advising general public procure use PPE unless exhibiting symptoms caring symptoms. Public health advice must consider theoretical situation also people respond advice. third reason, along previous two, cloth masks (not surgical better) woefully studied. may believe - surprising well - truth. Guatemala lockdown april first week octubre.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* first one whining toilet breaks power goes out. read somewhere Denmark fewer deaths year normal can't remember read it. 

Maybe someone give link? day two since read it. Trump got huge dose monocloncal antibodies day 3. Ronaldo probably asymptomatic. well virus actually. Oh god id happiest person planet earth go yankee game next year. miss fat tony Bronx yelling Stanton ""During global PPE shortage beginning pandemic, extent asymptomatic transmission understood, recommend everyone wear mask times. WHO, point, said masks ineffective. easily disproven myth. go look mask guidance early on. advised general public wearing masks reserve PPE healthcare workers caring sick outside medical contexts. course masks effective. That's recommended symptoms taking care people symptoms. clear later effectiveness cloth masks. surprisingly little evidence effectiveness relatively recently.""

This completely false. archives headlines many news organization show backpedal mask. Never mention shortage primary cause public. matters, people use N95 grade part. 

Oh mask research, nah solid evidence decades. google doc floating around TON papers respiratory virus. last flu pandemic prior Swine Flu, 1968 pandemic one seems remember novel flu viruses Spanish Flu can't possibly kill many people, COVID passed death count recently, practically one realized COVID right tails 1968 pandemic. there's 1957-1958 pandemic killed slightly even people US. Yes, COVID surpassed death counts recently, that's point say kind influenza dangerous SARS COV II. fact novel influenza viruses deadly dangerous taken lightly (""It's flu!"" ""The flu barely kills anyone!"") novel coronavirus also dangerous. Otherwise, Spanish Flu comparisons stop holding water. Better yet, stop comparing SARS COV II influenza altogether. Covid tests aren‚Äôt really big deal. 1.5 year old moderately uncomfortable couple seconds, upset less minute got fine. It‚Äôs ridiculous babies politicians are.

Not food allergy throughout life eliminate lot trouble stress. need constantly carry epi-pen. stress accidentally eating wrong thing. need skip meals particular restaurants carry food around. don‚Äôt really keep news even reading consistently experts think worst going behind us summer 2021. Hang there! Yup. Something like 40,000 people flew directly China supposed travel ban. like green card U.S. passport made unable catch virus, yet that's ""ban"" worked. course, turned virus strains spent generations Europe first caused early U.S. deaths. change travel policy designed effective public health measure, consistent anti-immigrant policies.

There's 100s foreign reporters workers country. think they're successfully hiding 10,000s cases reasoning you. believe want despite evidence contrary. common phrase south growing up. Maybe Bad Santa learned mom. know articles use word ‚Äúslam‚Äù headline, kind produces collective groan? That‚Äôs it‚Äôs loaded word. two instances headline well: ‚ÄúWinners‚Äù implies finance contest; not. ‚ÄúExcess‚Äù implies standard excess; standard, opinion. 

Also, pertinent r/coronavirus? clashes ‚ÄúAvoid politics‚Äù rule subreddit. I'm UK, someone explain Florida intent infecting everyone? wear cheese instead masks. Lol. got WW2 costs WW1 handled :D insects

I gotta know. Insects? incoming passengers tested quarantined straight airport, aren‚Äôt released 14 days 2 negative tests (a recent change), positive test 21 days quarantine (apparently longer contagious point). 

How enforced? US military base itself, facility controlled Korean government? US military enforcing this, way Koreans verify quarantine enforced correctly. 

We know news coming Japan US military bases hotbeds Japanese public expressed concerned well. reason believe Korea different. Besides, given US government's rather dishonest attitude covid, pretty foolish ""believe"" Americans say something. Lmao making number. says.

And pretty hilarious typo might add! completed questionnaire. This. Many possible confounding variables. example, reinfection might common larger viral inoculum tending cause severe illness. true world become much shittier place since stepped up. Supply chain challenging Indonesia. wonder covid related manufacturing. wonderful country regulation imports exports. Hey test cases go down. know true stable genius told me.  get infect Korean people appear amazingly ignorant realities economics development. think happens workers developing countries relies strong global economy US stops non-essential consumption? lose jobs, lose income, go miserable poverty. don‚Äôt live island. yes, course developing world schools, can‚Äôt believe didn‚Äôt think that. 

I think ‚Äúcivilised world‚Äù outside America keeping everything closed figment imagination, that‚Äôs case anywhere Europe, keeping anything closed becoming difficult reality hits home. becoming harder harder justify gargantuan sums public money spent keeping people home. unsustainable, money often many times spent national health year, could absolutely positive impact wasn‚Äôt wasted vain trying stop virus. 

Your hypothesis economy would come grinding halt everyone sick also completely baseless. Even serious flu pandemics without restrictions almost impact economy. Plus fatality rates COVID amongst bulk working age people (20-49) low, around 0.02% according WHO. paranoia dead bodies factory floor delusion. Everywhere reopened seen much greater improvements economy.

If don‚Äôt see damaging remote learning is, suggest tiny bit research. Vaccination programs also halted world I‚Äôm going spoon-feed everything don‚Äôt know.

Your ignorance destroying lives society, please educate reality arrogance demand closure economic activity. would watch video someone else‚Äôs bike ride? tax evasion considered virtue here, common citizen is. ‚ÄúBut since perfect solution - try all?‚Äù - anti masker

I liken situation going war (which never done, inly imagine)...

If going war, would helmet, armor, ammo, rifle cleaned ready, sight cleaned zeroed, bags packed properly reduce fatigue, etc. one thing could carry would save 100% time. combined, would give much higher chance someone didn‚Äôt put effort. 

Thats liken this. guaranteed way stay 100% safe still around people. stay hell lot safer gear properly. Never happen, regardless promises made happen one way another it. Right lockdown lovers seem still remnants common sense arguments. months go still learn virus finally get vaccine even people (I bet majority population) feel confident enough finally lift restrictions. 

This hard time stay-at-home-for-life mongs power ‚Äûargument‚Äù completely taken away finally need realise can‚Äôt force people sit 95% lifetime home they‚Äôre scared catch Covid. joy watching others put lockdown taken away blink eye.

The truth can‚Äôt put responsibility people protect catching Covid, safety measures improving vaccine around corner would say 100% f*cking best interest take matters hands grown adult protect health concers putting risk/or unresolved anxiety. going say this. Every Nuclear training model showing examples. say ""I also teach area""? 
That make sense.

I english teacher. also confirm.
Enjoy day. Well
Sadly dont use tho
We 1'400 positive tested like.. yesterday day yesterday DoD mandated quarantine upon arrival new installation, international not. Positive not, they‚Äôre sitting barracks twiddling thumbs 2 weeks. I'm reacting red blooded AMERICAN. I've lived lot places I've never city paved surfaces bike on. Like parks, downtown areas, suburbs. cities those. D.C. weird place indeed. people closed island nations.

Or Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam China.

African nations also pretty well approach. team play for? :D Kombucha kinda gross old people dying apartments getting reported running trains windows open. need start framing articles properly. probability reinfection 0%. probability lifetime immunity post infection 100% either. Spanish Flu killed 50 mil people.   
I think we‚Äôll fine die fall sudden stop end. say anything doctors. I‚Äôm saying cloth mask, neck gaiter, face-shield. CDC doesn‚Äôt want people wearing N-95 masks restricts air flow. said face coverings mandated help contain droplets talk, cough, sneeze. don‚Äôt protect you. wait winter time everyone starts getting sick upper respiratory viruses. Rebreathing germs day harmful. flu? Don‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm doctor. Go check cdc says. hung American thing, blinds problem.

Trump influencing aspects world's response this, whether like it. (And clearly, like it.) 100% agree society works social contracts social contracts make good (and bad) laws they're bad basis govern of. Governing pure science practical. they‚Äôre 45s. You‚Äôve never driven lol. 10-15 pretty much flow traffic.

And no, outside city proper, downtowns larger cities like Alexandria, there‚Äôs thing bike lanes.

It‚Äôs sprawling 50 mile wide bullseye suburban hell. whole layout cities around DC basically serve pump commuters outer ring inner ring back daily basis. Traffic second worst country (behind LA), roads large fast (When it‚Äôs bumper bumper).

Sorry bro, life experiences aren‚Äôt universal. boggles mind people make adulthood without figuring out. Glad agree. 66% Americans 99.9% chance dying Covid. lets stop fear mongering. Lets wash hands, wear masks, love God take care people nursing retirement homes. Well that‚Äôs true, lol. Disney World well (but don‚Äôt tell Gavin Newsom) can't say though. 
Because people testing positive told shedding virus, testing NEGATIVE virus twice three times initial infection getting better, getting adverse symptoms positive result, told ""tests"" sensitive false positives. would symptoms return severe tests picked dead virus particles? Plus, tested one sample positive results. follow patients. 
Then, long haulers. symptoms 2 weeks get onset symptoms again. leads believe mild infection got it. Went daily lives protection catch again. One factor people never talk regards East Asian countries got hit early less contagious, original strain virus.

The newer, contagious D614G strain evolved Europe around February, Asian countries closed borders early enough (due already experienced outbreak) seem spared.

I can't help think Japan would look like dealing D614G strain along. Cases might spiralled control knew going on. Conversely, D614G strain never evolved, Western countries might slower growth cases spring much easier time suppressing virus.

Edit:

Just people forget: viruses spread exponentially, even small increase R massive effect time (just look happened Europe R went slightly 1 slightly 1; full-blown second wave).

If assume, purely sake argument, original virus R0 2 D614G strain R0 2.5, one person original strain would infect 2, they'd infect 4, five cycles, end 32. One person D614G strain would infect nearly 100 five cycles. ten cycles, person original strain infects 1,024, whereas person D614G infects nearly 10,000.

And big outbreak comes nowhere, makes things like contact tracing impossible.   make sound like idea even considered..... scary. Finally good progress, hopefully trend continues, atleast till get vaccine I‚Äôm losing faith Reddit moderation process. get touch mods? I‚Äôm fed breaking-the-rules-user. likely, athletic performance permanently altered? career hinges could huge problem. got coworker commutes Saitama Kanagawa everyday, lol. Yokohama, even south that. literally entire world subject whims. not, article says south got too, whole country getting infected it'll worsen day like country Europe self-reported bias.... like asking someone who's accident late night they've drinking without administering BAC test. one going admit forgoing masks confronted healthcare worker. Also spin class dont worry shitty drivers tires going day either stayed 7 bedroom, 3 bathroom Airbnb 17 people Mount Snow Vermont. bathroom situation wasn‚Äôt bad surprisingly, it‚Äôs probably boys peed outside half time. fucking insane use pictures cheese explain multiple measures effective one.

Oddly enough use meetings alot structure security jobs! Great model alot things seems silly works Yes please. 

Capitalism designed benefit capital; socialism designed help society. Bonus points ""social distancing socialists"". would nice see evidence herd immunity achieved anywhere earth considering us since december still nowhere near magical herd immunity threshold idiot anti maskers seem think save everyone dad's danish friends joked really different every day lifestyle, since chances bumping someone covid woods hike very, small. (I wish could healthy hike-loving danes üò≠) new president change minds anti-maskers? anything, I'd think they'd dig even harder opposition new narrative oppressive fascist Biden administration forcing PPE people.

This correct. politicized already. Even Trump loses goes quietly, become identity issue Republicans automatically oppose whatever Biden does. mean, sure, talking bathrooms, kept talking them. Kids die, 20 year olds die, 30 year olds die.

We gotta put lot crap right we're measuring generations live (even 40-50 years ago, i.e. constant terror nuclear holocaust), we're still OK think. 

Knock wood main crisis generation course.

Interestingly enough, model N95 masks work. That's exactly way look it. Grilled Saturday sunday. great odd reinfection detected two infections different strains.

This could mean lot reinfections considered false negatives. Question - I'm confused testing. virus take 14 days show someone gets negative test day 5 6, conclusive that? I'm mostly thinking potential exposure asymptomatic. sports leagues handling covid better gov'ts ever disclosed investigation finished.

I work aviation Swiss Cheese model used decades help mitigate aviation accidents. Essentially accident happens chain events (holes cheese). line good day, however time holes line therefore problem/mistake caught, chain broken accident averted. 
I wonder industries using Swiss Cheese model well? Well, FINALLY seems like Sweden allow hard lockdown happend, regional goverments decide.

Thank. Fucking. God. needs mass replacement FHM. Probably. Would nice personally affected wake call. facing mistakes difficult. started biological weapons lab Wuhan, China Since week 35 deaths per week 10-13, falling. Week 40 13. Week 41 considered entirely complete yet.  probably influential nursing home Covid policy Sweden lowest hospital bed rate EU. strong indicators immunity Covid19, any, short lived. average, course significant outliers. 

There confirmed reinfections, someone catch twice, positive test results, samples available high quality sequencing, must interest ability carry analysis. all, low probability real number reinfections thousands times higher.

On side argument, weak indications long-term immunity. hate analogy. Thats sad, could another 25 years least. Damn kids living lives caring anyone else. banned. Winston Peters leader populist party well, aka NZ conservatives... outbreak linked hospital

^ straight you, misinformation Yea fining people wearing mask literally dont kill people make mask cloth house serious fining people drinking beer public. failure. wiser smart. get gold star. ‚òÆÔ∏è without wearing masks testing. Yes, Vitamin fat soluble. That's good, retain stores exposure/ingestion long time. bad take tons supplements body store point toxicity. People take vit C want pee out, D. sure quote, article:

Scientists said patient caught coronavirus two separate occasions, rather original infection bouncing back becoming dormant. comparison genetic codes showed ""significant differences"" variant associated instance infection.
""These findings suggest patient infected SARS-CoV-2 two separate occasions genetically distinct virus. Thus, previous exposure SARS-CoV-2 might guarantee total immunity cases,"" authors study glad heard many cases yet, sounds like happening least bit. America much worse every country poor response, probably Hah, back joke practicing you, missed completely!

But seriously, I'm bit worried people misunderstand news also start giving medical recommendations. 

Stsy safe! wouldn‚Äôt take year. Yes, stupid headline. North Dakota definitely problem right surely running risk overwhelming local hospitals don‚Äôt something response, isn‚Äôt way point out. don‚Äôt understand people can‚Äôt speak factually situations. North Dakota trouble, make headline something expresses reality instead panicky nonsense. could whole thing death. none require hospitalization would apologize calling previous poster ‚Äúloser‚Äù? Locking things others like peeing section pool. common cold mutates correct ways enough immune systems able keep completely. Basic evolutionary theory.

By correct ways, mean must impact way immune system recognizes infectious agent know specifics want overreach. example, could proteins outside capsid something, proteins recognize virus, proteins mutate changes looks like immune system cause problems.

This dude definitely thinks knows does, that's obvious read comments. Oklahoma. actual crimes handled sheriffs department. Highway patrol handles highways.

 Local police enforce city ordinances minor things speeding local roads. basically revenue generator city. Careful now, there's downvote brigades sub come time post fact get COVID twice.

Denial. predictable. Question Tegnell gets questions pictures spread weekend packed nightclubs.  municipalities must review whether existing advice followed. see anything needs sharpened, says.  also asked nightclubs growing problem.  idea it, says.

from briefing Br√•stad, General Counsel Swedish Public Health Agency, says decision made temporary local tightening general advice. take effect 19 October.  opportunity Swedish Public Health Agency decide consultation infection control physicians certain measures taken.  will, example, able decide whether refrain using public transport, refrain visiting special accommodation, refrain visiting shopping centers necessary, refrain indoor environment many people gather. refrain restaurant visits physical contact live with.  apply example two weeks extended.

and number cases nursing homes doubled last week.  worrying signs nursing homes begun affected again. short time, number cases doubled, although indication link opened (for visits), increase began then. important test generously among staff, says Anders Tegnell. Cases equal hospitalization. small amount infected people need admitted bed person spreading virus wearing mask wouldn‚Äôt even get social distance reach masked person work guy whos wife got corona ""even though wearing mask"" concluded masks ""don't even work""
 
Which annoyed crap nobody EVER said wearing mask would make bulletproof.
 
Nobody believes wearing seatbelt makes 100% safe every car crash, (not all) people still understand good wear them. denies that? writing me? think answered wrong post.

We know long immunity lasts general. 8 months 25 years, know. 

So reinfection cases important, one points direction immunity lasting long, type patient.

It consistent data immunity lasts 10 months gone. 

I think people assume ""we know immunity lasts 4 months, know lasts forever. anything lasts 4 months, know lasts forever! Despacito nr 1 hits forever!"" Swiss method, swiss hole method. apply cyber security, taking care one's health... Endless possibilities. knows people selfish. said ""Yeah, masks probably work, buy there's shortage"", many think listen, many would say ""masks work there's shortage? buy many can"" I'm going eat mask. think am? animal?

/s I‚Äôm afraid Trump virus probably never going go away Wisconsin already cheap place live, there's going even cheaper land houses market come 2021 posting facts outbreaks? seem quite opposed that. Why? maybe time install country's track trace app.

*Cries American* rest stink though! call 'defense depth', security. Lights, doors, locks, fences, cameras, personnel.  one, since one defeated one way another, whole stack layers vulnerability much harder get past. Imagine much better things would people actually read entire article native language instead misunderstanding English. crazy consider every day maybe 9 things go wrong, tenth ‚Äúhole‚Äù didn‚Äôt line up, accident prevented, never heard it...? 1975 yes, transgender people undergoing gender reassignment surgery 2012. questionable indeed (downright horrible even), certainly unique Sweden (Denmark similar programme, example). would trust information coming PBS. practically contained spread. vaccine developed need monitor imported cases way easier certainly ethical herd immunity without vaccine. Barrington Declaration merely restatement rightwing position, money priority human life. certainly suppressed, deliberate attempt undermine work governments control virus.

The Barrington document deliberate attempt confuse public mind scientific consensus regarding Covid19. People die mischief. Yeah, like breaks car, seatbelt airbags Even worse, brigade people lying articles say cannot even read English properly. get rid masks contact tracing still ok virus gets max 4 slices? Instructions unclear, glued cheese face. effort serve delay inevitable. Thank you! I'll keep mind future.  Dr John Campbell good video topic reccomned look yt seems reasonable, it‚Äôs case, it‚Äôs really going much issue anyway. 1-2 years immunity approximately good enough reach vaccine finish line. Cheese vegan. /s It‚Äôs wild explain things like unfortunately many covid positives asymptomatic, hospitalization rate KEY data set really wanted stop virus, could nuke hotspots. would really prevent spreading, sound good?

There consequences actions often worse disease. Cart washing, disinfecting seats etc mostly theater. helps people feel safer inclined go support businesses. It‚Äôs important understand, respect adhere safety measures also trying maintain semblance normalcy. Oh no...

Anyway.... Careful, there's downvote brigading sub post facts get COVID twice.

An inconvenient truth. Straight Chinese hospital treating imported Covid-19 cases closes 3 local asymptomatic infections confirmed

What language want switch since speak English well enough read writing? [58% Americans Less $1,000 Savings, Survey they're not. That's math works.. oh, gotta buy cheese?! I'm surprised mention reddit owned CCP Maybe read post again. seem think contains ""Postulations immunity general population"". 

It doesn't. course changes nothing healthy 20 year old. totally obvious think needed write down, Ok necessary write it.

If affects say chemo patients general, big problem well. would mean lower chance surviving cancer everybody.

It like woman person world, ever, affected this. football. already kill them, slowly. live post-factual world.  Yep cheap, effective, cause burden. understand issue. People fighting like violation rights, meanwhile government subpena Google dragnet operations violate 4th amendment rights, yes, masks biggest threat freedom.

There war truth sanity country. Downward spiral. rare reinfected common cold - ya know, family coronavirus endemic humans? far early make blanket statements like yours.  Soooo homeless people.... they're gonna follow rules curfews masks?? get fined??? Oh virus deadly homeless population wiped out? Oh right strain fucking flu time move lives. Wake up. claimed yesterday lockdowns work. homework big boy. Wait, timeout... get I405 saying unpopular things, they‚Äôre right. understanding Stage II &amp; III running partially parallel.

I get might coming across doom gloom, they‚Äôre factually accurate. Yeah feel that. reality CT likely quite different lot states. Masks completely mandatory everywhere, I'd say everyone respects that. Lamont fucking around shit here. Although able jiu jitsu without masks, kinda odd. welcome open arms, get way. Single, kids, live alone, ambivalent comes existing, let's get it. Well, that's kinda hard argue with.
I weep country. Yeah, that‚Äôs daily number, people occupy beds longer day. Intensive care us equal intubation. noun, noun example death despair, yes. Good work, Trump. /s Unless people coming back dead number deaths always increasing. 250,000+ deaths, locked months. makes say we'd ""only marginally higher level mortality""?  fund police firefighters. Hate wet blanket assuming vaccine give protection year more.  yet one base estimate protection on. Kind like assuming people 100% prove infected twice people getting reinfected. Yes. Old people die. It‚Äôs sad bad thing. Crippling life people, especially students, order stop opposite compassion. grandmother choice would absolutely die year earlier let sister (and statistically 749 public school students) person education. Ah yes, old hospitals making money faking pandemic actually bankrupting they're going keep going it. companies choose use tried true method? advantages others? keep hearing new techniques host disadvantages, like stored ultra cold temperatures... Yeah, certainly don‚Äôt support robbing people fund it. Good thing doesn‚Äôt happen advanced western democratic country. Someday, US might qualify that. Exactly 90 percent cases need hospital bed all. downvoted? There‚Äôs still *if* reinfection, it‚Äôs definite despite anecdotal evidence case studies. could getting reinfected defiencies immune system immune recognition issues. yes, immunity lasts short period time, may need twice year. yearly, every two years. would suspect mounting evidence leans towards us likely needing vaccine sort regular basis. Asshole. Fauci disagrees you. You‚Äôre in! Ridiculous point. one western world takes vaccine seriously. immune response vaccine stronger natural infection.  people charged win court. waste resources. They're gonna say something along lines ""socialism bad"". Imagine stupid. 1.5 year old toddler get repeated Covid tests (q-tip shoved nose) go participate allergy study, despite otherwise sheltering home.

My 4-year-old kid wear mask walk around outside zoo.

Neither one able play kids person 7 months.

Trump likely didn‚Äôt get tested 4 5 months, violating debate rules putting lives risk. Chuck Grassley Lindsey Graham refused get tested sitting extended time next people infected event, Mike Lee hearing person speaking poorly ventilated room *without mask*, positive test subsequent evidence isn‚Äôt infectious. assholes demonstrated weeks ago could orchestrate super-spreader party *at White House*, creating cluster dozens hundreds infections (and possibly many hops line). Multiple people infected in/around White House hospitalized severe symptoms, may die.

To quite frank anyone supports GOP 2020 flushing reputation good responsible human toilet. appropriate description ‚Äúdepraved indifference‚Äù. Well, there's acceptable course, voluntary charity like GoFundMe, there's authoritarian approach, that's robbing people fund it. Sounds like Harry Potter book Except we‚Äôre praying hole-in-one. Ellen men. Thanks, heard it; read paper. That's true, think we'll waiting least mid next year widespread vaccine distribution, given low risk 50's unfortunate political situation, I'm afraid many opt out. addition, many speculating vaccine effective 75+ age demographic, main demographic actually needs it. right, think late us revert lockdown-caused damage now, concerns retrospective point. Goodness reading table wrong understanding about. people time it‚Äôs getting old.

And no, clearly don‚Äôt care. trying downplay pandemic get even people killed. It‚Äôs amazing. fucking least, act like it‚Äôs covid know otherwise. Remember JRE actually interesting Joe constantly go rails conspiracy BS?

Pepperidge Farms remembers. Look man, unless got magic drug somehow makes hospitals can‚Äôt overwhelmed this, think gotta keep it. Luckily, we‚Äôve got vaccines coming up, treatments potentially really reduce hospitalizations deaths people happen get sick. two prongs enough end pandemic, it‚Äôll within year happens. Till gotta gotta do, know?

I‚Äôll real you, like understand you‚Äôre frustrated, god knows days (I guess I‚Äôm feeling charitable today), flatten curve fact still objective. There‚Äôs couple problems though- A. virus floods hospitals really really fast, B. time notice somethings wrong it‚Äôs already late. yeah, new cases cause concern level. Like sucks dude, know. agree healthy people really shouldn‚Äôt worry virus- honestly really quite mild standard pandemics. Problem is, everyone‚Äôs healthy young enough. aren‚Äôt unfortunately can‚Äôt shield rest society. flattening curve becomes ongoing process, get vaccine good treatments. Like again, sucks. 

I don‚Äôt live fear this. know I‚Äôm going die. dysentery month two years ago, honestly feel like dangerous me, young healthy person Covid could be. self isolate 7 months, mostly mom, immunosuppressed 50s, also lot anxiety Covid. sucked- probably lowest point life, I‚Äôve shit this, know? Even moved out, it‚Äôs certainly ideal situation. really really sucks, days can‚Äôt help feel I‚Äôd give two years end life exchange one back. It‚Äôs unbelievably frustrating. it? Ya I‚Äôm upset 1.4 here. can‚Äôt imagine 34 wtf sub due moderators heavily biased removes threads like support opposite they're pushing. 

Every single thread I've tried posting gets removed even information comes harvard, oxford, stanford, etc. Including one got removed. Lockdowns. pandemic. Nah changed hoax something we're ~~fatigued~~ bored with. hospitals overwhelmed good chunk people can't bothered care.  They'll haunt him. Get tested It‚Äôs interesting one massive country effectively eradicated virus best growth projection, people US fight wearing masks. Trump see. Shame, Prague (beautiful city) rest country deserve better. I‚Äôm going orthodontist next week get retainer redone dermatologist following week, city. haven‚Äôt inside real buildings house outside picking takeout summer so, little nervous tbh. cancelled family reunion year concern elderly relatives others. stayed home like done.

Everyone scientist care research there's really politics ill will, even though countries bitter rivals. surviving hard enough without dicks one another. Uhh, r/unexpectedINXS? take two samples everyone, use one batch testing test second sample individually someone‚Äôs batch turns positive? people really believe stupid shit like this? 

I literally someone tell ""there already cure cancer researchers make way much money pretending research release it"".

At point life, literally cancer research scraping girlfriend paid 2/3rds everything. wouldnt hear tried tell him. pants down, that‚Äôs how. naw say dec jan mild  works. Denmark's capital, Copenhagen, literally border Sweden. Southern Sweden Copenhagen essentially one large urban area, economically morally feasible block travel two major length time given amount traffic necessarily crosses there. flair speaks mental illness many sub. 

The parts Queens Brooklyn high infection rates aren‚Äôt really playgrounds neurotic upper middle class Karens might see good news. 

They‚Äôre likely poor lower middle class people. people $10,000 fine likely hurt much much much harm might‚Äôve caused society. 

People lost fucking minds. unacceptable. learn? Based quickly guy got reinfected, sounds like would need get vaccinated 2 3 times year. Considering hard provide enough tests (at least America), realistic? There's already talk hard produce enough vaccines everyone, think assumption people would need once. Well, it‚Äôs complicated it‚Äôs absolutely point scientist trying understand well. won‚Äôt know, know. reputable scientists seen referenced believe we‚Äôll need one dose. twice year? year? maybe that‚Äôs part it.

Vaccines trigger different immunologic responses. targeted component/mechanism vary (and could different natural infection immune response), length immunity vary. minimum could provide lesser disease upon infection, although opposite could hold true via ADE. 

To point though, think article could‚Äôve argued way well. don‚Äôt simply need vaccine, need vaccine provides least year protection least 50% individuals; well tolerated high-risk groups. Anything short that, arrived solution. lesser effective vaccine may prove useful, acquired herd immunity and/or advancements treatments. Otherwise, search continue. Sounds like CNN Colorado relative humidity, especially indoors, essentially drops zero percent winter. bode well. Wasps previous list. mommy covid denialist protective Halloween strange reason. It‚Äôs spilled neighborhood Facebook page well. Yea I‚Äôd concerned pauses *weren't* happening  I'm sick hearing economic growth, means nothing poverty. 

Instead money focused quality life. There's absolutely ""control"" here, significant protection high risk populations, despite various leaders repeatedly vaguely alluding some. Even nursing home visit restrictions lifted many states. financial assistance isolating risk, forcing many back work.

This opposite describe, letting fire rage uncontrollably, COVID first Northeast, South, Midwest. Pre-existing condition. bunch idiots! brave. So. Brave. Women also extremely high pain tolerance average, makes sense guess childbirth..

Thank goodness moms.  Unpossible? How‚Äôd even write without auto-corrected? Headline say: 75k deaths due lockdowns

None 75k COVID. STOP spewing headlines. gives people reason think MSM overhyped it. resident area, thanks jackhole. sure compare America island 5 million.

Compare EU instead. like EU. getting 2 million deaths from? estimate line WHO's recent estimate \~750 million people likely infected according serological studies

From article posted.

*"" Add excess mortality unreported deaths countries record keeping good enough allow assessments true death toll pandemic may high 2m. ""*  rare single case gets reported globally. 

[See reality media medical establishment research respect cases prior reports. Let them. Good! ruined relationship half-brother day covid unfortunately. Thankfully never close. brought girlfriend mothers house eighty years old (she overweight, thyroid problem, bad asthma, survived cancer 9 years ago) refused wear mask keep distance said ""boo-hoo"" asked mother fall ill die actions. said ""people die, time cull herd"" lost dressed front new gf. doubled, tripled, let crazy claiming ""plandemic"" anti-masker.

This whole situation very, awkward draw line family care family members die. even point family point? supposed others backs body else will? shelter harsher parts life support other? sounds scary, number daily deaths state 11 people, population 900,000, already age 70. half age 80, older actual life expectancy. tragedy death be, hardly cause widespread alarm. got news you, Corona cases never go away. part life like not, time goes learn treat better therefore fatality rate drops. virus also mutates contagious less deadly version itself. Eventually another common cold-causing coronavirus. Humans amazing creature bodies adapt things. rare single case gets reported globally.

&amp;#x200B;

Because counts person genetically sequenced, twice, even different strain (to prove residual first infection.)

SO, 23 small number, large one. Oh, even take account becomes common time. Trump came live news Florida. god... Scary. Generally reinfection bad worse first time. 

Well that's true. place regarding worse second time not. 

IMO, guess, mind you, stuff like amount exposed utterly SWAMPS things like previously exposed. Tbf, scary disease. scary dying heart attack, still die complications later, alone hospital bed.

She make net would hopefully die home, surrounded family vs likely die hospital alone Covid.

It fucking intense disease, forces many people make extremely difficult decisions. idiots claim nothing, overblown therefore take precautions protect people enough prevent ton people getting Covid. Car crash = covid

We get it. 

Also, many people protestors kill? mean logic, protestors wearing masks probably killed people. It‚Äôs easy simple do. Hot water, laundry detergent, ring water. Air dry. Done. replicate New Zealand, Denmark would shut borders. simply possible. legal practical standpoint. Well 70% people it, seems like social distancing really practiced much... 

but joking aside, people catch virus recover would make harder spread, true. herd immunity that... herd immunity simply immunity virus people catch pass on. harder catch, less likely, chance catch it.

I think 70% probably low side (though go article highly educated myself)... measles example (though ballpark) needs around 93% herd immunity hard understand many? many healthy people die closures worth saving many die anyways? Yes sounds harsh question must asked. average age death covid higher average age death everything must start think little harder. close things stay shut cure could years. much middle devolution. Somber reading.


A grim series articles published today Journal American Medical Association makes clear hard United States failed controlling ongoing novel coronavirus pandemic‚Äîfrom country‚Äôs horrifying death toll inability drag shamefully high death rates. ND, masks. unbelievable misinformation. I'm saying **told** us back March wear mask. That's thing he, *in past tense*, **did**. Obviously, he's telling us wear mask since time that.  
 
That politifact analysis particularly edited clip makes seem like contemporary advice Fauci. sense, telling people currently Fauci saying, false appropriately rated politifact. mean read carefully, header ""**Video shows outdated face mask guidance Dr. Anthony Fauci**"", undeniably *did* tell us back wear masks. 
 
And that's my, think people's point thread. lied us back he's playing sort political role. job public health expert conveying medical science us, misleading public manipulate stockpile distribution. That's job government public. 
 
This even point discussion though. established fact lied wearing masks. admits told people early wear masks [in order preserve healthcare 
 
Here [full words back people complain about. That's taken context, like politifact analysis stupid facebook post know nothing about. raw 60 Minutes clip explains tells people wear masks. 
 
Turns instead told us wear masks back then, [lot people would Cuomo even got around [admitting himself. ""misinformation"". last week one highest EU. highest numbers EU second world. Beaten Andorra point, number rare kids indication percent community spread dumb people's revenge facts professionals. saw Snapchat story, guy goes Westpoint said CDC admitted numbers fake. he‚Äôs Covid 3 times 4 11 [French died reinfection.

We've articles widespread reinfection since March China May USA: [13 USS Roosevelt Sailors Test Positive COVID-19, time media medical establishment start keeping track findings instead constantly making discoveries within months span. survived fist infection virus. Probably lung function cold corona virus infections happen children indicating long lasting immunity normal.

Long lasting immunity seasonal coronaviruses normal. short lived.  totally agree you, specifically talking people say shit like ""you cant trust anything nasaaaa says"" every scientist somehow part conspiracy cover bullshit like now? can't vote, please do. Ok, phrasing. look comment got described correctly there.

But article researcher said point result suggests epidemic responsible many deaths attributed COVID-19 alone

More carefully found 249,167 total excess deaths 1,021 counties, 183,686 deaths directly assigned COVID-19 death certificates, another 65,481 excess deaths officially assigned COVID-19. means 26 percent excess deaths directly attributed COVID-19‚Äîor viewed another way, actual excess deaths 36 percent higher number officially attributed COVID-19.

And said ‚Äúall‚Äù paraphrasing sentence Researchers discovered every 100 excess deaths directly attributed COVID-19, another 36 excess deaths‚Äîalso likely caused COVID-19, less obvious manner.

Caused Covid-19 ‚Äòless obvious manner‚Äô would odd way try say ‚ÄúCaused dying Covid-19 symptoms someone making mistake death certificate testing.‚Äù Dying disease isn‚Äôt ‚Äòless obvious‚Äô way dying than... dying it. whole POINT non-Covid 19 Pandemic-caused deaths.

So everyone top ten comments screaming ‚Äúsee, virus deadly say‚Äù completely miss point. Sure, isn‚Äôt technically correct non-Covid deaths, got proportions wrong statement, didn‚Äôt miss whole point article. come on, obviously leads Illuminati Ah. OK. Comparing excess deaths vs reported coronavirus deaths. Thanks. kidding... Crazy Virus genome WA open winter. people still fairly cautious. Im teacher kids got flu per usual. Definitely seemed hit hard though. Welp, looks like rona's gone. Guess time OPEN'ER BACK UP! Right? RIGHT!!? 


/s Stop going school FFS ... Trump loving anti-vax sister always says, ""I research. truth come out."" I've also seen comments online parroting same.  coming from? Fox? radio show? right wing organization spreading argument. Finally good news &amp;#x200B;

### Findings

The patient two positive tests SARS-CoV-2, first April 18, 2020, second June 5, 2020, separated two negative tests done follow-up May, 2020. Genomic analysis SARS-CoV-2 showed genetically significant differences variant associated instance infection. second infection symptomatically severe first. ""Follow money"" one see posted lot. One would assume people followed money reason never tell us led to.  ruin views chickenpox, chickenpox ""reinfect"" people. never leaves people. Chickenpox herpes virus like herpes viruses, gift keeps giving. reactivates people immune system impeded leading shingles. yeah yeah, fuckin shit sherlock. agree, using cases making comparisons like ""New daily cases record high since April!"" fear mongering clickbait. Hospitalizations much better metric tell us problems actually cropping up.

Where getting 2 million deaths from? estimate line WHO's recent estimate ~750 million people likely infected according serological studies.  absolutely right covered outbreak anywhere near well previous ones, like original sars. know told make death less meaningful. comment talking clickbait ‚Äúwe never going back normal!‚Äù news articles reddit posters see every then. idea comment less ‚Äúhigh quality‚Äù like, mostly comment daily threads. seems odd comment singled definitely lower caliber ‚Äúinformation quality‚Äù much comments remain stopped april...

More interesting created May even referenced fact several times. Posted last week, therapist got tested last week thought covid symptoms came back negative Wednesday thought everything good.

Just heard got retested weekend came back positive today.

She‚Äôs young I‚Äôm worried worst case scenario. anyone know there‚Äôs data supposed heart damage failure showing bunch mild cases like couple months ago? That‚Äôs thing I‚Äôm worried right now. We‚Äôre even done yet. Could much longer average American. good news definitely. take weeks get negative tests, even symptoms resolve. practical necessary isolate people get negative test. 10 days isolation symptoms resolving (if any) seems adequate amount time typical cases covid. anyone else problems breathing mask? I‚Äôm asthmatic find hard breathe mask. I‚Äôm anti-mask anything, really don‚Äôt like wearing this. hope pandemic soon :( says deaths indirectly caused pandemic camefrom illnesses¬†such Alzheimer's disease, diabetes heart disease, sharply increased five states recorded COVID-19 care, fear seeking care emotional crises stemming the¬†pandemic could also contributed deaths, says, well inaccurate death certificates may misidentified COVID-19 death.¬†

To sounds like side effects lockdowns, COVID disease. hard say really you‚Äôd probably right healthcare workers (if goes well) vaccinated around december. 
the catch high risk person you‚Äôre probably going need wait population ditching precautions, else you‚Äôll risk getting regardless. literally called lockdowns ""ghastly global catastrophe"". saying hurting us? Afaik, first trial allow 12-15 year olds trial, good news efficacy safety vaccine pretty great keep expanding study. Save lmao (I'm american) Um... absolutely get tested. accountability man. know didn‚Äôt give anyone started showing symptoms? get tested sake. know. survived first infection COVID. second got her. Yeah I'm Chinese even was, imagine dumb think words tiananmen square would bother me. could done part lawsuit even usual method tracing. never said death meaningless? secondary factors recognizing make deaths meaningless. still died reinfection covid- knowing info important? entirely agree. People seem happy blame governments (albeit, it‚Äôs much warranted instances) - however, lot answer for. citizens countries, think roles don‚Äôt apply them. someone three times. Fuck chicken pox. submission removed because


**Titles must edited source.** submissions must submitted original title submitted article applicable. article uses caps title, changed [title Editorialization via title editing kind likely removed. ([More believe made mistake, please [message moderators](/message/compose?to=/r/Coronavirus).* side things. lock down. Cases sky-rocket. Hospitals full covid patients. people die can't get in, plus people dying covid. 

Either way horrible. point minimise impacted. Well, 90,000 first game. 80,000 second. time get last game count going somewhere 0 10. ""Try conceal"" implies failure conceal. knew it, anything? Lol dude. March, top doctors US, including Fauci US Surgeon General, told us need wear masks randomized controlled trials showing masks actually work stop spread viruses. said month two. peak pandemic. 

And telling truth.

Now changed mind claim masks work, admit lying.

The vast majority RCTs, actually every single one June 2020, really find masks stop spread influenza-like viruses.

So top doctors claim lied (they actually telling truth), say telling truth believe them.

Why would believe self-admitted liars? coworker says fucking time, wife nurse. worst says, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt normally go conspiracy theories, Covid‚Äôs manmade virus let Chinese need make pay!‚Äù WTF?! think mean deaths happened lockdowns, people contracted Covid.

Personally agree them. CDC numbers along Johns Hopkins. live San Diego lower rates CA coastal cities. 

I agree cities learning going treat virus. 

To answer original question again, Republican males likely get virus higher rate anyone else. likely got less evidenced Republican controlled cities lower rates.

There lots factors this. Lower income areas hit hardest. due lack education, meaning people believe hear, lack income, lack medical care. Recent article accuracy. Trump endorses it, that's red flag MuH fReEdUmS! Honestly family showed climate/covid deniers would happily shred relationships. refuse spend time associate ignorant sociopaths. seems people understanding distinction ‚Äúcaused COVID‚Äù ‚Äúcaused pandemic‚Äù. *sharp increases* deaths causes states large numbers COVID cases, coinciding time frame higher number cases. deaths occurred. *is* bad news. good article, say much people already saying: least two vaccines New Years, economic recovery, etc. saying there's light end tunnel. 

Personally, early-mid September, thought eight nine weeks vaccine approved, slowly starting help. still think we're trajectory. Perhaps, isn‚Äôt real question opportunity cost implementing measures? Spending time money one thing negates spending others. LMFAO JOKING outdoors thanksgiving weekend. Roasting hot dogs six feet apart. 
We skipping holidays. Yes, hear you, bad position. keep deleting reply I'm reading much said see it. also want make (I'm still mess, cookies lunch).

I close someone deeply intractably depressed, sound like might be. biggest barrier getting ""better"" (I issues goal, nvm) perceive anyone around actually cared loved her. Nobody could get retreated far blind people's feelings positive actions. feel worthwhile treated body like crap open up. 

I could gotten bad too, someone cared said, ""How say hate care you? saying I'm worthless feelings worthless too."" able improve somewhat could finally see clearly mind twisted everything oblivion, numb feelings others systems come heaven force nature anything. made supported people. could changed yet left fester get abused overlooked electorate lot colleagues Stockholm well... march much different UK.

Most clerical jobs moved wfh many still now. schools closed, many events cancelled, theatres cinemas closed themselves, restaurants bars low capacity... forgetting sheer number people hospitalised bring healthcare grinding halt. Even CFR treatment 0.0% would disastrous let run course. letting run course without treating people completely question legally morally. snark strong one! Floridaman epitomized got blamed Italy Italian first wave gone. exact guy stood Chinese experts March condemned China.

So second time? big proponent masks, social distancing, testing, disinfecting everything... im sharing house/cabin people, feel like I'd beyond masking point. we've gotten tested, mask/distance everywhere else... time eating, cooking, sharing bedroom/bathroom facilities 24/7, kinda game over. 

That said, keep current social circle small. bf hang one couple sort regular basis, groups, dining out, etc. attended family gathering even masks. It‚Äôs 2020, irony dead Thank you, will. infect others kill *them*. notice laws drinking death, laws drunk driving.  Fauci gives really really outrageous estimates scientists it‚Äôs job give false timeline, last timeline Q3 2021, translate around springtime realistically ""Wiesn light"" popup bars outside bars/restaurants sold beer (only Munich). least five months. Bro even read purposely excluding ‚ÄúWe clearly see high-quality antibodies still produced five seven months SARS-CoV-2 infection,""

Look date NZ first arrival. Look date NZ stated lock down. Count days them.

Notice NZ number considerably lower.

Simple arithmetic. Nothing debate. He's unbelievably fit. necessarily mean tools fit infection. 'abundance caution' 
 
the thing doctor's office abundance Tylenol dismissive attitudes. I'm glad spouse gotten results looking for, spending time home *has* ""weight sabotage"" plenty people. (Myself included. Although would find risk going cardio class high even one open near me, gonna hear complaining closed.) Lockdowns exist musicians chose perform? ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Metaphorical‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat second choice? Scrotumhead?"" unreasonable think people tested since majority cases asymptomatic. reason France example seeing low deaths despite breaking roof new cases compared April/May big part becasue cases 50x now. incapable testing enough people. second wave seems worse look death rate low compared first wave. Obviously speculation needs taken grain salt know sure many infected end. ever know. point time think say we're still underestimating cases 10x since testing much better earlier year. Yes, idea ""lockdown"" lax compared sensible places. talk Swedish work colleagues wonder they've got event bigger mess do. A-A-A-nd... They're stylish DAMNIT!! pretending spread kinds viruses around exact things pre-pandemic? definitely people different situation am. think important see people coming trying understand actions though. someone like affected can't comprehend someone would lazy guidelines see they're coming might make sense. Let‚Äôs hope long Covid concern misplaced  seems work pretty well Sweden. quite cheap drug produce? deaths though.

Not all. Deaths still needed positive covid test included daily totals. used teach concept grade school... Americans get stupid? acting like ""NoTHeR fLu"" never truly understood viruses, pandemics, vaccination first place.

Again, pandemic mentioned killed thousands Americans million worldwide. new flu arrives, needs taken seriously, minimized saying ""Oh, flu!"" excuse hold water first time came since China recognized novel pneumonia, even flu. maggots, starved oxygen, writhe jump bag, creating ""pitter-patter"" sound. sounds subside, maggots dead cheese eaten.

I really need today you‚Äôre telling construct mask multiple layers Swiss cheese Reading comments permanently lowering IQ. Cases difficult compare due higher testing rates. Deaths deaths though.  Replying op deleted comment:

There‚Äôs approximately 260k excess deaths year, suggests undercounting 25%ish. Further, cdc breakdown excess deaths state month. timeline location excess deaths matches reported covid deaths. 

Check 

The dashboard useful seeing where/when excess deaths occurred year.

Let know find evidence over-counting covid deaths. haven‚Äôt seen any, evidence I‚Äôve found points us under-counting covid deaths.

It‚Äôs also worth noting individual doctors final say cause death. order covid deaths over-counted, doctors en masse would lying cause death, goes Hippocratic oath. tested phase 2/3 moment, right? even that. Pubs &amp; bars closed Liverpool **if can't function restaurants** 

So wehterspoons Yates staying open. That's exactly point, though. much additional information testing ability gain 5 weeks? case arrived earlier mean data made anywhere make choices did. 99%, make sure he's taking vitamin zinc Comparing absolute numbers stupid, 9% positive rate extremely concerning Mild means hospitalized, that's different asymptomatic. Except government (i.e. formal organization society) regulate cigarettes, alcohol, junk food cost society outweighs individual benefit. example, cigarettes might third party smoking (i.e. smoking restaurants). COVID, might uncontrolled spread others. 

If COVID killed/harmed person made poor decisions could chalk poor decision making. spread one person bystander happens room (say grocery market workplace). That‚Äôs society begins weigh masks, distancing requirements, etc. cost individual ultimately society (i.e. GDP, productivity , whatever measurement) outweighs individual benefit. They'll fine...all need quick experimental $100,000 monoclonal antibody cocktail injection, Remedsivir (available premier medical institutions clinical trials everywhere!), plus 10 day course super steroids administered dedicated team 10+ doctors (starting day test comes back positive) it'll disappear like miracle! say: is!  Latest ‚Äòrestrictions‚Äô Science now. Wilson seriousness likely saw like polio, uncontrollable nightmare. Disease time looked now. Penicillin antibiotics invented yet. someone got wild infection, thoughts prayers really could offer. definitely less cases first peak deaths ticking worrying.

Deaths follow cases 2-3 weeks already 140 day despite fact treatment covid definitely improved somewhat. Cases kept going deaths seeing infected 2-3 weeks ago good chance start pushing way past 150 deaths soon.

&amp;#x200B;

It unlikely get bad first wave get worse earlier take measures less deaths per day peak event? didn‚Äôt say miss it? Ricotta (either using leftover whey mozarella aciduating milk), fact pretty much make paneer making ricotta bringing heat bit pressing it. hard cheesecloth way press it.

Note: **Kevlar protect rifle bullets** used conjunction ceramic thick UHMWPE plates stop 7.62x51mm NATO rounds *ability* so... maybe much claiming independent thinkers get ‚Äúfacts‚Äù memes. 

Heck, stop fact uniquely using term ""sheeple."" people like say ‚Äúlet‚Äôs herd immunity‚Äù sounds scientific ‚Äúlet‚Äôs get everyone infected accept mass casualties bodies street‚Äù no, you‚Äôve got wrong.

[Phase III trial success wishful thinking we've never approved human coronavirus vaccine, development animal coronavirus vaccines involved spectacular failures, whole live virus seems cause severe immune dysfunction.

I know part looks hopeful lasting immunity, natural immune response unhealthy dysfunctional first place. seems like virus bad suppressing *correct* immune response like is. early data releases China knew cytokines secreted response virus make sense likely immune response body naturally forming likewise nonsense. ignore measures China took less month discovery identification Covid-19, US never even considered:

* quarantined everyone tested positively, home spread family separate location (hotel converted convention center)

* travel Wuhan forbidden end February

* Doctors nurses allowed go home rest, stay hospital sleep, lucky nearby hotel avoid spreading virus.

* People street without masks permit escorted back home.

* 30 thousand! doctors nurses brought Wuhan surrounding towns help combat virus. also brought equipment ppe China. knew fighting defeating virus concentrated location much easier fighting country.

* lockdown lifted 0 new cases 14 days straight

The one case November person hospital pneumonia (no confirmed human transmission) recovered apparently spread virus wide (not super spreader) hospitals Wuhan started getting full mid Januari.

Most Chinese cities outside Wuhan region hundred cases less extensive contact tracing testing. People fled Wuhan right lockdown shunned rest China helped containing spread.

On top Chinese new year commercial activity shut anyway new year vacation period extended government.

The US stopped flights coming directly China ignoring infected people coming Europe. actions US (and EU) little, late.

Just look happened Qingdao yesterday: 12 people infected, traced leak quarantine hotel incoming travellers countries. 6 million inhabitants Qingdao tested. 

This kind measures takes keep China relatively free Covid-19 . 

But sure, keep telling covering instead trying learn them. find fucking hilarious (and sad) Kane people masks... Fucking hate skys website, co-worker constantly fox instead actual fucking work, imagine insane shit guy spews everyday. used Hollywood paint picture US amazing rosy many years. whole world admired wanted like Americans. new Information Age, Trump, Covid truth seeping showing horrible be. world see us ever again. 
Hollywood cannot help us anymore. Great insights NEw Zealand could go jail agree depends situation. people see wearing mask necessary. saying walks, likely walks many others, unexpected surprises. Forrest Gump said, crap happens. Perhaps coming cooler weather wearing mask comfortable. Credit    Woah.. woah... woah... next time, cast someone conspiracy theorist hoaxer, probably take 2 minutes look they‚Äôre commenting Reddit.

You completely off-base, couldn‚Äôt wrong. What‚Äôs more, got bit low personal presumptive rant. Worse, painted image based little information.

To set straight, scared days. self-aware, proudly feel express emotions. don‚Äôt days fear 2020, you‚Äôre awake.

Secondly, would gladly call feminist denouncing it. clearly don‚Äôt know me.

Finally, media ‚Äúwielded‚Äù purpose. always been. It‚Äôs matters protected. yes, also looked critically: doesn‚Äôt mean screaming ‚Äúfake news‚Äù means actively seeking counter perspective multiple sources.

Which leads last point, don‚Äôt solely rely news media one country. end, closely followed head KCDC talking suspected reinfections months ago, something broadly covered time U.S. story dropped Monday (stories dropped certain days greater impact, research it. conspiracy theory, it‚Äôs fact).  totally attacked wrong person. wish well, direct venom someone else.

There's nothing ""inherently slow"" testing process.

The process usually takes time due lack resources find test subjects, inherently need wait years see drugs safe/effective. can't 'reinfection' explained another virus contaminated swab first presentation? 

In case report, ever one swab taken first presentation (ditto Hong Kong case Ecuador case). Ireland they've openly addressed anyone dies tests positive Covid, listed Covid death, regardless dying stroke etc etc. 

I heard months ago people said conspiracy. literally regulations. Think that. tragedy community. hope words fall ears need hear now. state opposes masks social distancing. shown multiple times recovering covid grant immunity. get again. 

All political ""heard mentality"" talk evil, also false. Even 100% infection immunity. solution still: stop spread. Wear mask, social distancing, contact tracing isolate everyone exposed. New Zealand got numbers zero, opened entire economy back normal.

But incompetent politicians can't lead, organize, even understand do, lie tell nothing do. go right ahead. meanwhile, rest sane ppl stay home fight virus. Let guess, dropped high school? know bad reinfection be? luck vaccines **Christoffer Bernsk√∂ld is** responsible healthcare Stockholm outside emergency hospitals. emergency rooms, home care nursing homes. issues binding guidelines, ""controls coordinates"" also develop employees' ""knowledge commitment"".

He also behind ""governing regulations"" March 20 practice collectively excluded ""the fragile"" patients hospital care. [pressured DN reporters (19/5), made clear doctors solely responsible decisions.

I ask Christoffer Bernsk√∂ld knew asked staff special accommodation send fragile patients hospital. resources nurture spot? Saturation meter, oxygen?

""I idea equipment available special housing,"" replies unit manager. ask question medical companies region hired. also mobile devices ASIH (Advanced Home Health Care) pull oxygen things.

I ask enough. many they, approximately 300 nursing homes?

""I know exactly many."" roughly? searches computer, ""No say‚Ä¶ may return."" (He later message answer. many companies involved, clear many people have. stated agreements must ""adequate staffing"".)

I ask intervene medical companies hired region began ration visits nursing homes. even told DN matter care whether doctor not.

Bernsk√∂ld replies Stockholm Region decided ‚Äúthat digital visits replace physical visits. quality form content. still different, course. ‚Äù

Did really say that? ""Yes, think called Digifysical Care Guarantee."" (I look up. Calm down, Stockholmers. Unit manager Bernsk√∂ld expressed carelessly. even Stockholm Region thinks doctor screen good one room. ""Digifysical care guarantee"" says health centers offer digital visits must replaced physical.)

Did see problem doctors starting make decisions distance?

""We saw reason say fundamentally wrong,"" says Bernsk√∂ld. ""The doctors followed recommendations."" remember wording, surely National Board Health Welfare also advised physical visits nursing homes? (Not really, *unnecessary* physical visits advised *against* .)

I ask possible decide patient qualified ""a higher level care"".

""It existing doctor make clinical assessment.""

I get bizarre suspicion. mean ""clinical""? define term?

""No, like straight arm"", Bernsk√∂ld answers. clinical examinations also performed remotely, says. online doctors that.

Really? say ones? head unit refers publication National Board Health Welfare: ‚ÄúDigital care services. Overall principles care treatment. "" However, say anything ""clinical examination distance"". would sensation did, expression paradox. ""Clinical"" medical language opposite ""distance"". Greek *clinic's* , ""belonging sickbed"", English *bedside* . sit there, listen person, heart lungs, take simple samples, feel, squeeze, knock, smell.

**The head health care** **nursing** homes said misunderstood ""clinical"" means. makes clearer react doctors started writing patients examine.

I believe Christoffer Bernsk√∂ld best - within framework competence. nursing education. one else either, except matriculation exam individual courses. became head General Medicine budget 2.5 billion, also experience state municipal official.

This went.

In 2017, position ""Head Unit General Medicine Geriatrics"" announced. university degree requirement, experience healthcare welcome merit. 18 people applied. applications thinned out. able help track two.

Of sixteen, eleven seem medics nursing education university level. five, four university degree. latter neither. normal administration, application would returned unread. got job: Christoffer Bernsk√∂ld, 34, professional politician, unemployed. merits: county chairman SSU later chairman health medical care committee √ñsterg√∂tland, newly elected member SAP's board.

**I draw this** highlight region something. Namely, area politician without professional knowledge painlessly converted head extremely knowledge-dependent organization expert responsible Stockholmers' lives health.

The Corona Commission formidable problem fixing responsibility mortality Stockholm's nursing homes. incompetent regional managers rather appointed spite rules? politicians, read ""governing rules""? required limited companies handle care nursing homes doctor takes care 270 different patients? No, companies answer, arrangement approved elected Anna Starbrink. know doing? say expert contracts either, course trusts officials? closer inspection, turns got job merits merit skill.

Perhaps responsible, citizens, tolerate Zaremba  Zaremba one country's award-winning journalists authors several books.  2014, awarded Gold Spade Jury's honorable mention series articles DN Kultur, ""The unprofitable patient"", New public management affected Swedish healthcare.  also written about, among things, forest, school, mental health care, labor immigration forced sterilizations.  latest book ""The house two towers"" 2018. **When emerged that** number doctors written elderly covid disease medical treatment telephone, head unit Christoffer Bernsk√∂ld DN replied: ""Distance visits must high quality physical reception visit.""

Analyze sentence. saying? Superficially, idiotic, way ""television *should* real theater"". give orders laws physics. message. say ""shall hold"", also said ""can hold"". responsible limited companies responsible medical care nursing homes given green light ration visits.

At regular intervals, question arises whether county councils, regions, harm good. cannot done better others? Would rational state hospitals health centers run municipalities collaboration? way? make sense political detailed control healthcare? way, rational 20 principalities, parliament, computer systems medical records bureaucracies, produce tons directives lack disposable gloves? small Region V√§stmanland investigator G√∂ran Stiernstedt find 3 strategies, 20 policies, 264 guidelines 281 action plans (SOU 2016: 2). regions primarily special interest politicians officials livelihoods them? could explain repeatedly let guards strike territory takes precedence considerations, including public health.

**Why many** nursing homes ill-equipped pandemic, poor hygiene routines, oxygen, even simplest saturation meters cupboard? must *not* medically responsible doctor institutions.

If sounds absurd, way sound. went: connection Noble Reform 1992 (yes, called so) municipalities given responsibility care elderly, proposed also allowed provide primary care. consultative bodies, led LO, endorsed. medical association certainly like idea. county council association went roof. circumstances would relinquish monopoly hiring doctors. managed get party friends government run investigation. extra feather county council's hat, municipalities *forbidden* *law* employ doctor.

""It one biggest betrayals older people modern times,"" says geriatrician Gunnar Akner. ""No one would move special accommodation medical reasons - right *must* doctors responsible patients participate organization business.""

Most recently, Amanda Sokolnicki newspaper (3/5) asked question meaning regions. got answer always get. According Anders Knape, chairman SKR, regional level ""unbeatable"" force comes representing people, making decisions close concerned least, demanding responsibility.

Let us test hypothesis.

**I call the** representative people, health medical care regional councilor Anna Starbrink. ask reasoned region decided patients CFS 5-9 excluded emergency care. would describe group patients?

""I that. medical issue. "" know CFS scale about? ""Not detail."" committee discussed suitability using CFS scale priorities? ""No."" read decision? Anna Starbrink answers presented committee. changes, read it, ""absolutely"". reason reconsider. Politicians interfere medical assessments.

I read aloud her: ""During covid-19 pandemic, certain categories patients directed emergency hospitals."" political decision, it? categories meant? Anna Starbrink sounds surprised. ""I think description strange‚Ä¶ individuals‚Ä¶ always individual assessment‚Ä¶""

But says categories. No, think Anna Starbrink read vital decisions. read without understanding.

**It often said opposition** lifeblood democracy. guarantees power scrutinized abuses stopped time. ask questions S-leader region, Talla Alkurdi. No, say CFS scale about. read ""Governing regulations"". remembers presented board item ""Information"" one objections. Unfortunately, possible read said. point usually recorded.

So far people, power responsibility.

At end interview Anna Starbrink, politely wonder could reconsider ""Governing Regulations"" realize meaning. really know CFS scale is.

The Regional Council replies possible request elected representatives experts control. trusts officials possess knowledge required.

Let us also test hypothesis.

(end part 3) excess death rate reliable source see wether deaths significantly changed one year next. 
And see excess death 12% comparison previous years. , also less.

So yes Covid attributed measures cause excess. also put things perspective. 12% significant need failed? realized something wrong, people got incredibly sick, shut country enacted laws stop anyone else getting sick country almost covid free. **""Clinical frailty scale""** , ""clinical fragility scale"" developed 2007 Canadian researchers. relationship vitality elderly ability cope stress illness examined. scale goes 1 9, one stands alert age. train regularly better condition many latte dads. four suffer chronic disease more, eight greet flu relief. Somewhere middle scale, memory problems begin. CFS-5 may need help paying bills.

According geriatrician Gunnar Akner, purpose estimating patients' degree fragility legitimate. wanted help fragile become little stronger. Elderly multi-sick patients often malnourished, passivated often drugged. edible food, little exercise optimization medicine list, take step back stairs end awaits awaits everyone. soon turned CFS could also used statistical basis: plan need care, estimate remaining life expectancy assess benefit medical treatment.

This fairly uncontroversial, long CFS used clump patients categories replace medical examination. intended handling individuals. scale medical. Even hourly substitute home note Lisa forgetful, lift heavy preferably lies couch. says little Lisa cope flu. according ""Governing Regulations"", Lisa longer individual Lisa CFS-5, unnecessary care hospital. certainly says CFS scale serve ""as guide"" ""an individual assessment always made"", least long covid patient goes stairs. say done doctor. needs examine patient first.

**Following guidelines** March, doctor visits nursing homes Stockholm decreased 25 percent. Many seen doctor since pandemic began. unknown number patients prescribed palliative care without medical examination, usually crime. Stockholm Region claim misunderstood? think so. write ""managed medical complications site"" knowledge neither oxygen doctor site, maybe even drip saturation meter, give staff choice relieve last trip.

If think, DN's Anna Gustafsson Lisa R√∂stlund made effort keep reporter belief meaning profession many years come. [On May 19, tenth article elderly patients denied care . Jan, 81 years old, doctor Familjel√§karna Saltsj√∂baden AB phone beyond rescue prescribes morphine. Jan's son almost threatens staff nursing home agree connect drip inject blood-thinning medicine. needed patient get life back. article, two doctors say treatment elderly Stockholm Region interpreted euthanasia.

The DN reporters hold person responsible accountable. unit manager Christoffer Bernsk√∂ld ""feels safe"" doctors knowing doing.

**It's slipery line** . (Or silly? I'll return question.) doctor discharged Jan without seeing region asked do. patient Jan Andersson probably CFS-5, category Christoffer Bernsk√∂ld practice excluded ""higher level care"".

Bernsk√∂ld one four behind decision ""Governing regulations"" 20 March. others chief physician Johan Bratt department heads Anna Ingmanson Maria Andersson.

Three days DN report, regulations classified region's diary. new ones, 22 May, longer talk ""prioritization"". Gone order apply CFS scale well division patients categories. CFS scale *can* used, guide, *only doctor* also ""has sufficient knowledge experience tool"". longer says fragile elderly people stay are. *recommended* sent geriatrics rather emergency room.

Seemingly small differences, vital.

**I speculate** many lives consciences Region Stockholm's regulations cost. hope Corona Commission Mats Melin support issue. already know sure: light-shaded order region enough doctors, nurses others forget professional ethics probably also law.

What gives political level municipality Riksdag demoralizing force?

I suspect Corona Commission problem reporter: *Now know happened.* *But responsible?* Commission likely need language experts bring spirit region's message.

If national Pew Gallop Poll, asked people title meant, would assume COVID-19 deaths. people dying virus. Either primary secondary cause death. Live die capitalism; literally. Go covid positive sub, happening lot. However without sequencing RNA first second infection can't formally confirm reinfection. Trying part people struggle with. actually WISH proper lockdown. Might show people needs done, rather amount people see daily partying, going maskless everywhere, etc. right? China, nation 1.3 billion people, less 5,000 dead supposedly ran body bags.

It‚Äôs understood virus survive surfaces long time, fomite transmission isn‚Äôt thought significant vector time. 

Would time money spent deep cleaning better spent improving HVAC systems things like contact tracing? worth, [plain old ordinary incredibly effective killing virus. solve entire problem, good decreasing fomite vector transmission. recent sampling scandals like one UP

Which scandal? understand, spoken volunteers told safe too. quickest new vaccine developed 7 years, governments already buying vaccines trial. feels slightly rushed me. Even Peter Hotez uncomfortable it. basically explain GF make sure wet markets China really animal dense farming methods gotten rid of.

&amp;#x200B;

Its like driving car. might never break speed limit everything right still get accident fault own.

&amp;#x200B;

Or maybe always speed, never check mirrors, never indicate turn never problem, instead relying luck.

&amp;#x200B;

The difference risk, either minimise ignore it, longer afford ignore it. Therr two strains one mutated one came europe mostly impacted US one Wuhan. rickygervaislaughing.gif  need beds exceeded serious cases? Would still say what? loser. Comming IT-Infrastructure.

There many areas deal ""failure"" similar approach taken (Like multiple disks save data, standby server clusters, load balancers, site backups...) try explain also...

But dont use ""protection"" end like this: toss whole bunch different concepts one post feel somewhat related get access original papers? 
As said live digital age...... people mislead online since beginning internet.......but hey know truth part people started brief pandemic soon found, AMAZING found autopsy one two persons China small village, got virus (without knowing upfront decided people need autopsy dead need looked into, able see right away could tell man made created nature (because stated say one still stated.....I seen evidence corroborates thinking, seen people saying isn't.....that ain't proof anything.

Sure....and iam üéÖ  Yes, half people work believe shit. work hospital. there‚Äôs immune system 99.9987% effective BNO tracking reinfections here: Masks can‚Äôt block corona...masks trap CO2 suffocate you. Ive waited year half specialists states. also need seen specialist every 3 months since booked see year. Deja vu, seen situation would say concerning. unusual case.

There two types re-infection studies, first population based, estimate re-infections based time gap first second infection. Qatar study best example this, found re-infection risk 0.01%, re-infection cases mild. (This crowded region world, nations practice better physical distancing even lower risks re-infection.)

The second type case studies, case one those. Case studies look particularly interesting unusual cases, type study require expensive genomic sequencing confirm first second infections different. people mild asymptomatic re-infections get tested, let alone get scientists genomics studies them. first confirmed case man Hong Kong get tested travelling. asymptomatic, tested positive. would never known re-infected travel checkpoint. case got genomic confirmation re-infection infection happened serious. first person die confirmed re-infection woman cancer treatment depleted immune system's memory cells, second infection functional identical first body unable remember first infection. type study disproportionately unusual cases, heavy selection bias.

In short, would expect re-infections rare, serious re-infections extremely rare. Qatar study norm, case studies like one exception. fully understand risks issue isn‚Äôt me. interact (or wish to) others higher risk myself. Thinking terms risk selfish part reason (I‚Äôm making assumption American) poorly managing pandemic. improvement real ones. Real masks taste like (last 15 soo seconds) Rlf-100 

I'll take treatments coming. wine induced theory thing mild cases people's bodies even bothering create antibodies. 

But sounds like manipulation strain? ""freedumbs""
I like shamelessly stealing that. Actually, cite screen name, might effect. Good question. Excessive attention given temperature taking surface cleaning seems bit like Covid theater me. Taking actions visible intended reassure people things taken seriously good, important vectors focus on.

Like ventilation mask wearing.  Quite possibly, that‚Äôs happened here. covid reinfection died like illustration lot swiss cheese model routinely used process safety industry.

It could include improving personal health exercise sleep well supplements like Vitamin C, D, Zinc, etc... ""weird reportings"" outhere.

And I'm saying due trying intentionally fake data. But... data fit expected behaviour. 

Yet cases/deaths France Chechia right, someone check French hospitals performing way better others. someone check what's wrong Chechia high death ratio. Thanks agreeing me.

Sars-cov2 
‚ÄúWhether B cells persist longer 6 months needs determined additional possibility absence immune serum B cell response, virus-specific memory cells cannot provide complete protection‚Äù
‚ÄúFollow-up studies patients recovered SARS suggest SARS-CoV-specific antibody response short lived. patients, SARS-CoV-specific IgM IgA response lasted less 6 months, virus-specific IgG titer peaked four-month post-infection markedly declined 1 year. Despite lack virus-specific memory B cell response, SARS-CoV-specific memory cells persist SARS-recovered patients 6 years B cell responses undetectable recovered SARS need gene sequenced simply get infected twice. would think simple negative test and/or large time infections would simply enough. particular symptomatic times. dude street works major company makes testing kits such. Usually see him, I'm glasses wine neighborhood social hour lawn chairs. I've explain stuff flies right head lol. 

But say impressed analogy came started using simplify overall pandemic. Talking packaged food refrigerators... guess best defense offense. Common sense dictates hire team Ant-Men beat virus enters.. I've writing BSL labs since February, begging realistic tests getting saliva samples people lining PCR tests.

NIH test saliva mucus recently, first one know of, resulted 1-2 days food environments. I'd double high exposure favourable conditions (for example food worker wiping runny nose, touching salad).

But important thing is: Mucus saliva change infection progresses, well ratio counts detectable RNA per infectious virus. That's biggie.

This one especially puzzling -- SARS-1 left many permanently disabled (they looked people decade later, half still messed up), basically disease -- closely related virus, receptor, attacks organs, causes similar symptoms -- average milder, approaching it? ""there evidence long-term damage, assume any""...  Reminder researchers among first ones (if first) calculate real IFR rates SARS-COV-2.

At time, caught lot flack it, showing real fatality rates unacceptable politically.

Now numbers pretty much common knowledge. good UK, looking good. Canadian here. Canada seeing surge especially population centres Ontario Quebec. numbers still relatively low compared Netherlands, almost 7000 new cases day compared Canada's 1000 per day.

I get tested I'm pretty sure covid19 March (was around Biogen conference Boston) deathly ill 36 hours... sick weeks. even bother going hospital point, treatments testing.

Shit sucks. Oh god, literally can‚Äôt understand things people say you. Go bang head wall. statements taken context. lockdowns attempted earlier year purposes, costs, benefits. wish America done better job, is, places benefited lower spread, least initially, thanks lockdowns. Wearing mask isn‚Äôt ‚Äògood‚Äô you. isn‚Äôt bad, certainly bad covid, don‚Äôt shouldn‚Äôt wear it.  good news front: starting challenge trials January UK. Wow. good site. Thankyou cool, thanks! It‚Äôs almost USA intended target China virus? 85% statistics made up. expect really likes line Rocky 4:

 ""If dies, dies"" will, run across any. send experts recommend wearing masks hard lockdown. listen them? want bad enough Italy required permit order leave house. locked hard beat COVID came back. Lockdowns work.

Masks, social distancing, hygiene protecting elderly. formula now, I'll never know. We'll learn live it, learn live flu.

Will impossible live way, would completely remove certain activities society would spread virus around. could something vaccine letting go wipe decade. lying...sorry guys.

That thinking months ago...but far mass graves suddenly missing lots people large scale...if case something would gotten leaked now...look uyghurs situation..pretty locked part province, managed get out....in comparison something massive like pandemic coverup country 1.3 billion would impossible cover up...

Hilarious though think science impeding ability argue. Funny that, wonder means. implies make Swiss cheese mask ...except one shows clearly people reinfected two distinct strains COVID-19. virus. mutate time, health care worker Virginia definitely immunocomprised victim disease. likely anywhere near rate of, say, influenza, original strain year spread change.

We're edge second wave here. Given Virginia case, odds exposure virus mutations extremely high- especially since health care workers case come go work likely premium.

Two infections 2-3 months apart? sequence it.

Two infections 12 months apart, PCR-confirmed, symptoms between, couple million people situation? get counted reinfection hesitation. 

I wonder statistics change accommodate -- eventually ""cases"" overall size population count dead everyone infected going second, third, fourth, etc. rounds... sure bill would covered that‚Äôs described article.

A legit quarantine like Italy less stringent better adherence like New York‚Äôs would actually made difference.



A lot countries didn‚Äôt need military enforcement, skeptics, like you, may option. Even law enforcement fall category well. "" really need know someone gravely ill order practice safe behavior? - psychologists say makes sense. Human beings notoriously poor evaluating risk, particularly threat question abstract, numbers involved.""

I think indirect polite way saying ""you dumb"". Cannot abstraction, numbers hard brain. jokes here.

**Titles must edited source.** submissions must submitted original title submitted article applicable. article uses caps title, changed [title Editorialization via title editing kind likely removed.

Actual question: ever heard trolley problem? decision mainly political, want transform populations sheeps. Masks work, see example Spain France always mandatory two months. around world think Americans morons.

So queried all, huh? Probably not. irony comment bit funny. end. pass. try focus makes happy fuflfilled vaccines roll you‚Äôll notice slow return normal achieving Taiwan's success (borders closed), Germany's success (hospital infrastructure), China's success (mass testing) South Korea's (test, trace, isolate)? US need like NZ specifically?

The success countries literally lie able countries open without much issue - something US could replicated much coordinated decisive plan. sure said US emulate NZ's strategy poor leadership make science useless reality science human component.

Yeah, blame leadership. recommendations Fauci CDC similar successful countries capable surviving without food shelter months end?

Why problem US? answer blame.

Also, biggest source continued community spread come group. comes people congregated overcrowded indoor venues like bars house parties. people absolutely deserve blame NZ counter COVID threatening people possibility mass much sooner, US government even pass second stimulus check.

Seems like common factor then. Note self: Stop unlocking phone tongue. Nobody's begrudging anyone missing things enjoyed. What's deserving criticism acting like oppressed expected adhere public health regulations everyone else. believe it. husband transported main hospital building building directly across street. talking 5 min less walk distance(he needed emergency eye surgery surgery center across street that‚Äôs wanted surgery). transported bed shitty truck even ambulance! cost insurance 4k!!! Luckly paid workmans comp(they fighting us wanting pay ended paying month). Us healthcare fucked! Vietnam island well? Thailand island?

Add 7 hours sleep, we're 15. throw hour outdoors exercise day sure, sure another hour random groceries appointments, we're remain home. we‚Äôre moving goalposts? don‚Äôt get anyway, People getting infected they‚Äôre working, friends family, arguably common moreso driving. 

Anyway gotta run. point people come yelling Redditors scared wittle babies need better argument. soon, locals, local wages. sure from, celebrating fall US likely bode well nation. Would rather China Russia dominating world stage? Trump eventually leave office someone better replace him. we‚Äôre better that. Also it‚Äôs entirely fair write entire generation rubric mindless infectious disease. Kinda makes seem like dick. also protects ketchup. China committing genocide right now, number cases China much higher. China exist, US would zero cases right now. It‚Äôs right skeptical numbers 2000 positive, put enforced quarantine- would ok guys?



I think lot countries looking ways balance care economy. 


As individual, prioritize health everyone around me‚Äôs first we‚Äôve seen mass panic do. Insane stupidity form politicians   Yep. James Reason book Human Error. Shearon Harris SRO here. might actually impede airflow N95 force air edge... Air follow path least resistance. Yeah, that's people frequent sub sound logical process able spot hypocrisy misinformation.

WHO already said lockdown important economy

WHO originally told people wearing masks ineffective

WHO gone back forth several times COVID-19 transmitted

WHO known buckle economic pressure US China give bad advice Luckily enough, I‚Äôm shit show Europe. Every country allowed shut borders. happens islands easier manage. Actually yes think lied number covid covid deaths. purposely reporting number cases US also believe could lie Covid diagnosis. lies time! reason believe everyone surrounding falling ill covid. mean that's point article, yeah? Even beginning pandemic, eradication never realistic goal. I'm relieved, finally. slow motion car crash weeks, utmost spread get virus, seeing go regardless.

Best day I've weeks. much tension gone.


PS: still voting party government, reacted far late, months, weeks. Apparently they've arguing behind closed doors. Useless bunch morons, incompetent. Please enlighten us what's wrong sport fans god forbid posting wsb.   That's feature. take helicopter drive-thru? bad people suck 2 months

New Zealand told citizens long lockdown would last, long US say would take ""flatten curve?"" Two weeks? Oh, look May now. New Zealand succeeded lie citizens, successful countries. Also, remember stimulus package? Remember ton people get still it? Remember long people wait unemployment many get still it? Ask New Zealanders government expected sacrifice time livelihoods free. Ask people Melbourne government handed $1,200 check basically told them, ""Good luck, own!"" 

Instead blaming fellow citizens following SPH orders best ability March May, maybe look root problem vote next month. Physical security finding small area actual physical security, normal human laziness normal human desire helpful. cited facts.

You misspell Sweden call *me* stupid, citing nothing.

Nice logic bro. Much science. Wow. People driving 1500 miles hour three dimensional space. prediction false done bunch things since start pandemic. 

I done anything past 20 list done number things 20.  Cheese please Louise Oink oink try transport milk cow stomach got rennet chees appears. transporter guy convince recipient merits cheese. call belt suspenders done challenge trials April. would approved vaccine now. Try Europe see people call u ;) 99 days good news better quality life, less obesity, less factors would exacerbate situation like this. would really clever retort US member country WHO. is. understand insurance VOLUNTARY taxation isn't, right? always rely ignorant Strawman arguments? go bike greenway area those, least traveled roads? cram crowded indoor space? 

That's understand. feel minor sacrifice help reduce spread make life easier people many options exercise do. Sure does. know I'm positive easily verify that, I'll stay home. Without verification kind impossible tell everyone sit around 2 weeks every time possibly run someone positive. (I understand physically possible, difficult socially people follow).

That's expanded testing allows; people easily live normal life, keeping safe. Amsterdam many people corona basically self isolated everytime ran someone it, we'd essentially full lockdown anyways, something government really trying avoid. prime minister talked can't keep current testing even. disappointing beginning would agree you, point would expected enough testing socially isolate completely, time, get this. shit rain season people depressed enough is. ""spin class"" say more. They're idiots got they've asking for. Oxford vaccine trial resumed literally everywhere else happening outside USA, nothing ""stopped everywhere"", J&amp;J one pause investigate issue. Last checked, even know person vaccine placebo yet. New Zealand moat wish moat. I'm sure means something people already convinced, though, unfortunately.  understand health insurance relies premiums paid healthy fund treatment sick, right?

So go tell Blue Cross/Blue Shield quit robbing policy holders think African countries actually test enough people. data random country pulled internet. Positivity rate 0.3%, that‚Äôs pretty impressive.

Most countries Africa general short lockdown virus got huge chance spread early. also heavy trust science experience Ebola. Hell, Rwanda even random testing. coming soon, LMAO 

Sounds like netflix tv show promotion nobody wears them, event supermarket/university.

Not sure live, recent two weeks probably saw 2/5th people wearing one supermarkets. know that's still low number like noone wears mandatory. european countries.

Here Denmark, less 0.5% tests come back positive.

Im guessing main reason 14% positive rate running tests. people ASKING persecution point work restaurant myself. mean government things mentioned done, would gone back normal life already. young, fit person: There's tons ways exercise fight depression involve going spin class.

The first time got bad head cold want go gym normally 6 days week, first time bought rack weights, fold away bench pullup bar home. Best part ever skip exercise day wanna drive gym - needed home excuses.

Source: depression, work out. studies people become superspreaders? initial fear masks, everybody would start keeping distance - feared myself.

(Also people already stealing masks ambulance cars. recommend using scarfs instead.)  read half article figured would like rest seeing makes want facepalm oblivion. Yes. soon emergency law written gives Parliament authority mandate face masks, made mandatory. Till ‚Äústrong advice‚Äù
Regarding lockdown: restriction movements. Bars restaurants must closed, except takeout. nationwide ban selling alcohol 2000 local time announced face masks mandatory starting tomorrow I‚Äôm tired propaganda insisting ‚Äúwe live it‚Äôs going away‚Äù face mass disinterest actually taking proactive steps.

Being proactive *is* living virus, nothing isn't. nothing means living rampant outbreaks same. example, China outbreak do? isolated patients decided test area patients living, lock people homes cases. talk living COVID, mean. Places like South Korea, Singapore, China, Japan, Germany, even Sweden learning live COVID; places like US, Brazil, Argentina, UK given up. People think way live COVID either wanton outbreaks rolling lockdowns given up. Slippery slope right average member country screw badly US, silly silly girl Dude, lockdowns delay inevitable. fucking anything. Even epidemiologists Nobel Prize winner going people now. 


We came lockdown didn't, going scenario worse Great Depression hands. People literally unable fucking buy food. basic economics buddy. can't prevent people working indefinitely. obviously place privilege think that's realistic.

Keep pissing people ruining lives man. going get ugly.

There's literally reason can't supply people UBI sustain economy give people necessities need live. idea must sustain fictitious red line everything collapse narrow minded repressed. finally opportunity completely revolutionise way run economy, instead rather get back office, kill anybody that's vulnerable, leave everybody else long term health complications virus still understand. sub: Trust experts

The experts: Lockdowns cause severe damage economy mental health

This sub: Wait no! experts Thats true well, poster bitching state many electors means ""has little vote,"" opposite case, vote matters presidential (and senate) elections small state.

Also avoiding parties/gatherings keeping distance still first two things do? *Up $700 H1N1 infected 20% world‚Äôs population. countries going 100 days local transmission pretty good way say virus eradicated. Vietnam basically second time now.

As China, keep opinions. However, I‚Äôm pretty sure Thai government information believe deductions based policy. China also ready everybody handle covid (government type? Check. Mask culture fumes? Check. Trust science? Check. Manufacturing capability, testing, willingness use resources? Check.) Downvoting guess. think bots. anti lockdown sub atm think brigading.

Covid-19 means Coronavirus Disease (20)19, i.e. disease caused certain coronavirus, SARS-Cov-2. 

As long term effects count disease caused virus, calling Covid improper. often called Long Covid, Long SARS-Cov-2 infection, calling latter would indeed incorrect. Well that‚Äôs oversimplification, unless places like Orange County, California counts south now. Also finally mandatory face masks public places inside.

It'll forever, impacts become like common cold coronaviruses.

I understand needs debate again, since basically plan since sometime April nothing fundamentally changed. think come back normal know vaccine really effective. exemple, vaccine flu pretty useless.
Then lot take it. virus mutating, may work all. took less minute find updated complete curve. somehow chose use older one showed exponential increase cutoff peak. thats interesting... Thanks makes sense.

LONDON (Reuters) - British government may impose stricter restrictions currently second wave novel coronavirus accelerates high risk areas, Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick said Tuesday.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson introduced new tiered system restrictions England Monday, Liverpool surrounding Merseyside placed highest level, pubs shut, curb acceleration COVID-19 cases.

‚ÄúThe message deliver leaders Merseyside need take steps, probably even need go want design steps jointly local government,‚Äù Jenrick said.

Under rules announced Johnson pubs serve substantial meals stay open purely drinking establishments close high risk areas. was, though, confusion definition substantial meal.

‚ÄúA substantial meal means kind meal you‚Äôd lunch kind meal you‚Äôd dinner - proper meal. doesn‚Äôt mean packet crisps plate chips bag pork scratchings,‚Äù Jenrick said. Sorry loss buddy. Look bright side, happier someone without drug problem. it‚Äôs correct interpretation. one god have.  Unfortunately, get care idiots source r/conservative enough? That‚Äôs like trusting r/antifa source didnt read article Dr Conley? man military officer isnt he, Navy? I'm pretty sure hes got say whatever told say since president commander. say president tested negative twice, saying president lied pretty much everything one could lie about. Fake news. deaths people dying anyway happen covid it‚Äôs big deal. It‚Äôs literally related COMMON COLD. It‚Äôs ploy get entire world vaccinated poison it‚Äôs easy sell people sheep rush process means less tests. Don‚Äôt fucking sheep Whatta night rob bank... Poor Fauci assuming trump gives shit health cult members. Well hospital admissions lower September lot people saying situation cities getting better vouch proposing anything. saying title misleading.

If really want engage hypothetical name change I'd say ""indirect covid related deaths"" *at least* gets rid primary knee-jerk reaction fearful population. least assuages fear extra 75k direct covid deaths. That's fear everyone read original headline experienced (as evidenced comments). 

No words perfect, headline completely accurate. current context, saying like headline dumb People also 3 months since July peaks. new re-shut downs. Cases still dropping naturally. illness tho Cardiovascular complications contributed 40% covid deaths, absolutely impacts heart greatly. Additionally studies showing many people never even hospitalized covid developed heart damage recovering.

It speculated see increase heart disease related deaths future result pandemic, wont directly covid deaths, would happened without illness.

I agree lot people misread headline, still waiting hear alternative accurate wont misleading way. People could also read article, tough ask particularly reddit lol believe everyone scientists fault. leaders countries(notice word all) made horrible decisions resulted this, nation failed due peoples inability empathy others. best mma commentator long time Sounds like India Brazil gotten lower numbers covid cases lately. Doubt it'll continue way guess time tell. FBI fraud lmao Please quote said would forced work. That's happened...

So yeah, awesome efficacy leads peak two weeks later.  might wrong always figured new normal going entail covid measures indefinitely, rather, post-covid new normal going mostly dealing socioecoomic fallout collateral damage pandemic wrought upon us thus far

As time goes though, we'll probably dealing pandemics nature given global economy's proposensity excesses lieu ignoring sustainability goals, top petty international political squabbles probably get paid Covid victims motor cycle deaths..

Wait layer make China pay wall? 102 years isn‚Äôt really long.... still high death rate. Thank insane take situation. fudged them. minister health literally said fudged data say show real numbers next day. fucked up. Also never strict lockdown. literally locked weekends completely opened tourism seasons. 2022  think news implies 5.6 millions got results already, like tested positive results found far.

Beside, scaling issue, technical issue. need increase number testers, reduce bottleneck minimum (paper work, ...). one thing trust Chinese good at, indeed logistic. So, Oklahoma City covid-deniers, response? Something don‚Äôt add Merkel really want decide all, discusses weekly state minister chiefs. unable keep massive amounts regulations standards.

It's literally ""wear mask, start large parties"". Like that's it. 15k even every person, ones organizing large gatherings. except they're putting risk. said two within two assume 75% population protected either already infected and/or vaccine. think time get there, going well end year occurs, think people going able get rid masks worry social distancing avoiding crowds get third quarter fourth quarter 2021,"" said. like he's still extending predictions include Fall Winter 2021, that's assuming lot goes right, tends spite people's behavior disappointing previous expectations.

The key is, country community infection never high follow proper isolation protocols test positive. Thailand used community bubbles - somewhat like used NBA NHL resume operations. 

Not really much different cruise. cruises offered 14-day pre-board hotel stay regular testing, completely unsafe go cruise (which stops need refill food beverage sudden contact outside world like medical emergency). really feasible 1500 boat guess. surprise all. concerns people talking things like immunity passports beginning pandemic. 

If give people low chance death complications incentive get infected, try get infected. 28 days later... Don‚Äôt give dude country significant spike deaths since earlier peak?

Cases Italy started rising significantly August, 2 months ago, yet here's daily country I've checked, least EU, mostly same. thought ongoing catastrophe. I'm speaking asymptomatic pte-symptomatic. cherry-picking data support assailing State California's purchase N95 surgical masks Chinese firm? That's actually advice GGD. looking mail sent GGD positive tested friend (asymptomatic, tested Thurs) states (as someone contact him) need quarantine Sun (3 days test) develop symptoms. didn't. following rules need 10 day quarantine.

In addition, called, simply said ""five days exposure without developing symptoms"" put Monday anyways, even official letter him. Mixed messages, neither 10 days stating.

Edit: continuity sake first post, people exposed asymptomatic, never developed symptoms, tested Thursday.    Bullshit many people actually run around ignore public health messages? clicked link, scrolled list countries realized 8 countries performed tests population agree wholeheartedly. Germany whole seem take problem seriously, however. Spain 6 times infections 18 times death rate Germany (both per 100,000 inhabitants last 14 days), think they'd feel need take strict measures. no, Catalunya starting *consider* closing bars.

Walgreens limited footprint South Dakota. hard sometimes, year i‚Äôve really appreciative. It‚Äôs nice live little bubble. Even did, anti maskers Karen patrols would force. depends. two major questions reviwing information COVID.

1). study, peer reviewed properly vetted. lot garbage information dubious speculation floating around would normally expect legitimate news sites, specifically unproven claims unconfirmed results experiments. One great example claim 20% current COVID cases US could linked back Sturgis. methodology used back claim specious economic, epidemiological study done. ton misinformation coming casts doubts severity pandemic misinformation going direction lends ammunition claims overhyped.

2). coming someone legitimate background history fighting infection disease. plenty names hear bandied around made living battling infectious diseases various politicians vested interest things getting back normal ASAP, ideological extremist views says freedom important safety circumstances, doctors history fighting epidemics invariably fall one aforementioned categories.

When doubt, listen someone says see make sense. thing comes public policy. lot people gave NIH Doctor Anthony Fauci lot grief changed position masks, listened logic behind old argument new argument position changed made sense me. Plenty people said disease worse flu lethality transmissability looked available data concluded argument make sense - never remember hospitals overwhelmed mass graves dug response flu outbreak US past 50 years. actually find best way evaluate information even prestigious journals like Lancet done terrible damage reputation putting bad information later retracted. even authoritative sources need properly evaluated skeptics eye unbiased attention detail logic. earlier example regarding Lancet, idea drug tried true 50 years treating malaria considered essential medicine somehow ineffective COVID also highly dangerous people use made sense. still convinced properly ruled treatment option since plenty studies gone either way none demonstrated dangerous.

So trust information? suppose not, view skeptics eye. suppose less trustworthy others. today, New York Post Spectator claimed special envoy Dr. David Nabarro recommended lockdowns bad way control pandemics, despite fact worked Australia New Zealand, among countries. get feeling story context. tell me, makes think read article? kind crux issue. things try help, since nothing happens vacuum consequences. 

The question many deaths prevented vs prevention efforts caused. Utterly impossible actually numbers deaths prevented, getting better idea ones caused/contributed prevention efforts, it‚Äôs looking worse day day. 

Between stories like yours, similar stories coming assisted living facilities elderly cut family, kids social/school lives literally upended overnight, economic casualties last decades, on. It‚Äôs hard believe said done would prevented misery caused. 

And important distinction ‚Äúwe caused.‚Äù didn‚Äôt cause virus, collectively decided response. wasn‚Äôt hurricane earth quake forced us act way, man made response decision makers held accountable. showed ranitidine alone lacked significant anti-SARS-CoV-2 effect (Extended Data Fig. 3), whereas RBC exhibited much higher selectivity index (975) bismuth alone.

Seems type matters, bismuth subsalicylate pepto might trick. hospitals asking people cause death now, ya know, way investigate cause themselves, therefore must reliant public make shit up. Yeah, shame really. lot good people scammed churches, especially Utah LDS church.   lol get tested? wouldnt know deadly covids? mean must super obvious it, DEADLY.  Getting tested possible exposure isn‚Äôt wasting anything, since even never experience symptoms real chance asymptomatic positive. Testing testing testing one best ways control spread.  89-year old Dutch woman, suffering Waldenstr√∂m‚Äôs macroglobulinemia, treated B-cell-depleting therapy.

Woah woah woah. Protections freedom speech one best things America. People need call idiots need better education idiots fewer between. still sure well masks work. gathering evidence months we're pretty sure work great, gators make things worse? Maybe, we're sure. mask bought target work well? Maybe, maybe not. remember, quickly science came conclusion worth recommending masks make recommendation call came beginning April public start wearing masks. Remember this? 2 weeks lockdowns started US 25 weeks since then. 2 weeks figure masks work unrealistic. look way, practice think makes sense also factor chances swinging election (if you‚Äôre looking presidential vote impact particular). Idaho‚Äôs odds Trump less 1 100 according 538. Even though Pennsylvania much larger, vote‚Äôs odds swinging election *much* higher voter Idaho‚Äôs vote. non-political debate anything days? Condescending cunt. What‚Äôs happens contract Covid? think that‚Äôs concern. Lol troll account vaccine still 100%. CDC say coronavirus vaccine expected 60% effective?

It comes political responsibility. Spanish federal government seems clued problem, local autonomous regions fight back ""to make economic problem"", someone else fault.

It's shitty way run country, honest, Germany far away approach either. state level Premiers want responsible making decisions need made, Angela Merkel tossed aside went meeting Mayors 11 largest cities Germany, seems persuaded Mayors take action.

I'm always little mystified see ""has reported several virus infections including dengue fever virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus infection. ""

At point start use knowledge gathered 15 years ago SARS MERS start apply severity transmission, infection recovery COVID?

Wouldn't save us bunch infections applied safety protocols developed SARS MERS focus studies treat prevent COVID?

For example, knowing know SARS MERS, worldmeters column ""survived never live again"". 

And know novel answer, frustrating see much work repeated. Mask primarily protects people close mask wearer, much person wearing it.

That posted lot April May. shit significant delay due federal, distributed system. still fast enough determine infection dynamics reaction time necessarily slower since local authorities act collected data.
The federal healthcare system gernerally leda redundancies faster response (Bavaria/BaW√º reacted multiple days restrictions federal govn. introduced lockdown). Additionally already 100k tests available march/April (privately owned labs) reached 1.2 million today.

Hi everyone, 
I questions fellow healthcare workers. work lab local hospital US, specifically outpatient send-out testing. handle covid samples every day, talking like hundreds samples. said, three people shift test positive covid last week. administration kept everything silent. general communication regarding positive employees, suggestion getting tested, cleaning reinforcement PPE guidelines, literally zip higher-ups. know admins. can't tell us positive HIPPA, tell us positives within hospital come deep clean least enforce PPE wearing (some coworkers still think mask cover nose). going school get MLT certification community college taking exposures seriously hospital, cannot go back in-person lab training two weeks safe. wondering healthcare workers experiencing thing hospitals reacting differently? overreacting? No, fail see that. 

While cases arrived spread different times, data testing *didn't*. fact country state got significantly seeded earlier exactly NZ comparably lucky - seeded degree done anything differently data testing it. KNEW IT!! virus goes straight masks. I'm glad finally put science behind it! weird. like flight part trip us remotely pleasant. torture put exchange taking trip somewhere nice.  expression creepy evil AF. virus dangerous enough killed 200,000 Americans, kill many allowed spread.

Big cities Andalusia seeing spikes contagions hospitalisations, local politicians downplaying risks (right-wing) Andalusian government unwilling take take unpopular decisions, people go bars sit close together inside without masks can. Absolute shitshow. bet claims democrat purposely infected point. xenophobic shut everyone out. Interesting. methods implemented intentionally contaminate milk desired bacteria? Funny mayor didn‚Äôt pay fine caught public without mask. Also virus isn‚Äôt dangerous, you‚Äôve gaslit obedience. I'm sorry pass purity test. I'm sure god look kindly upon judging complete strangers. OP responded brought US states claimed everywhere could like NZ acted earlier. 

It's kind exactly point places island also happened much earlier community spread comparable - thanks. Yikes, feel bad students had. I'm surprised hear professor agrees stereotype. professors seemed smart enough realize stereotypes generally trash can't really make sweeping claims countries consisting 300million+. RNA comparison valid way confirm new infection. excellent strategy would push infections really low globally, use vaccines ""swipe remaining breadcrumbs table"".

Now world half-chilling waiting vaccines...harmful opinion! Especially virus even disappear right away introduce vaccines. long haul push virus even vaccines. So, that's old, apparently uses now-discredited Stanford/Santa Clara LA/USC studies.

I wear mask car. think I'll catch virus car. walk door. I'm ready go. NZ, lost 5 weeks economic function strict lockdown (and weeks lighter-but-still-restrictive lockdown largest city 2nd wave). otherwise, life normal. live household vulnerable people, fear covid would basically shut-ins last 7-odd months; without fear covid, we've living normal, pre-pandemic life. We've working normal, going events, getting takeaways, browsing shops, going movies, impulse buying, lunch friends, etc etc etc. nobody worry catching covid. That's 6 months normal economic function economy. hospitals never overwhelmed, thousands people die, nobody developed longterm health issues (which could weaken workforce decades depending widespread longterm problems are).

Edit add: seeing supply issues however, since international shipping production hampered. would've case regardless NZ's response. Bill gates next level though. man reads academic textbooks pass time.

Volusia said dis 45% 21 million infected, that's 9.45 million infected. given Bangladesh densely populated likely rest country 161 million has, similar proportion infected 75 million infections. 

The county whole reports 5,440 deaths. That's IFR 0.007%. 

What's people's opinion this?

Look Peru, 0.1% entire country died COVID-19. 33,305 32 million. chicken pox wakes decades later living dormant spinal cord causes shingles unknown reasons people, worse form disease sure distinction matters current moment. whole point addressing pandemic head-on (ie. mandates &amp; lockdowns, etc) limit directly caused deaths (obviously) indirectly caused ones due overwhelmed healthcare system overwhelmed populace. distinction matters regard disease data, treatment, future planning, nevertheless, 300k deaths due pandemic.

But addition deaths, would like see headlines articles increased medical demands survivors COVID19. numbers got pretty staggering well. 500,000 dead? 1 million? 2 million? 4% absolute risk reduction. inverse number needed treat. every 25 people give Remdesivir, 1 survive. number needed treat 25 pretty good actually, especially consider mechanism action drug people actually get It. could get pill form start close symptom onset, suspect number needed treat would much lower. FL you? argument always see listed anti-maskers. really inconvenienced badly, can‚Äôt wear protect people? frustrating! wonder feeling wanting make sure ""serious enough"" doctor might actually listen concerns instead writing women women problem plays in. pretty much incapacitated pain even think going ER normal Doc past experiences that. clocks move forward lose hour sleep see noticeable uptick heart attacks, suicides vehicle accidents.

Here's source:  I'm female realize gallbladder stuffed full gallstones escaped blocked bile duct causing acute pancreatitis, least, months. Actually, probably years gallstone buildup.

I knew lot pain kinda joked people felt like dying got sick, getting sick lot. mean, feel like dying got sick assumed people felt death's door frequently people always grumble they're sick. pretty high tolerance dealing pain, seems, thinking problem.

So many dead that? 1.4 1.6 million? already 200,000. Try wearing surgical mask. weird say least.

Fuck religion! really anyone favors, including congregation pretend care about... haven‚Äôt seen claiming deaths aren‚Äôt happening, they‚Äôre Covid. It‚Äôs mental ! Also , 40,000+ travelers arrived US China Trump's swiss cheese style travel ban. travelers arrive directly China poorly screened, including 8000 Chinese nationals. Sure, balanced possible complete collapse entire Even Americans breaking point. unemployment homelessness reach high enough levels predicted, it'll become massive threat entire system. We'll see much loyalty million dollars buys happens. 
 Remember long ago, Bernie Sanders' policies well received even many conservative Americans. Politicians hesitate turn corporate donors save careers. Lmao, anyone half fucking brain could seen footage coming Wuhan February known virus problem.

Yet February, ""muh racism"" thought border closures. one them, know were. Sit asshole.

I gathered family thanksgiving hangout friends time. give fuck anymore. Chances we've already symptoms. Stay mad it. false well... might lower chances getting steps like this... get it, get it. mask make ""less severe"".

Wearing mask, social distancing, hygiene great tools prevent disease kind. going guarantee going get it. impact severity illness get it. Support BIPOC companies cheeses. End colonialism BIPOC businesses bodies. That‚Äôs get SIL3/SIL4 though, right? install redundant safety systems different vendors/OEMs said, ""ok fine."" 

I used absolute wording, one NEVER (ha!) do. ""Current Best Estimate""-""Infection Fatality Ratio""-
""0-19 years: 0.00003
20-49 years: 0.0002
50-69 years: 0.005
70+ years: 0.054""

Why saying lies CDC? Trials conducted sequence, sufficient time study results end phase.

That large part reason typical vaccine requires *ten years* develop.  

The testing cycle necessarily long. can't speed spending money politicians give speeches it. 

You certainly can't run two phases time, pretend latter phase justified earlier phase completed.

Some want everything yesterday, can't get it. public would better job remaining willfully ignorant. spoiled 

This word that's fitting people, truly. He's done level best. Fortunately, western world seen Mr Trump start. assure idiots making harder needs be, *nothing* politics everything frustration

There whole big world outside Yankistan I'd rather see reelected, wouldnt mean much majority us except memes, LOL America jokes even smaller desire go there.

 *would mean* America loses yet soft power world rest world takes even dimmer view currently what's happening country.

Personally speaking, best people know America worry them. mess here. alongside laz everything everyone is, we‚Äôve also got severe lack testing capabilities, today article cant even keep basic contact tracing anymore. summer get ducks row, nothing. countries world worse numbers do, im pretty sure almost tests available do. response nothing embarrassing. Wow. Even best universities world America can't fend stereotype anymore. America's really trouble. Yep. 

I've trying find info many people illness genetically sequenced, least twice time, try figure size pool people proven 23 come from, able find much. bingo grandma feels way, too. She‚Äôs 93. we're off-topic thread?

This game tennis rules. Besides sex-crimes recorded officers they're *in progress*.

It released public viewing accessible defendant *same issue*, ""public access."" Fun fact: Nobody ever died GI Joe cartoons. fact, nobody ever hit anything gun except occasional hand. People die horrific deaths comic though. Almost nothing saw 80s cartoon canon comics. Also Snakes Eyes white dude whereas Stormshadow Japanese guy. trained Soft Hard Masters. Gonna grab flamethrower start bringing work... guy understand speculating is. Normal people understand exactly saying. waste time him. many civilized countries would non binding agreement due duress unenforceable. That‚Äôs good. Newer building ventilation skin across units. anyone speak meme that's circling right wing areas internet? anti-maskers local area sharing That‚Äôs many people died expected average, official Covid-19 deaths.

And yet CDC come official mortality rate, claimed have. continue lie this? claiming CDC put official number put out. actual vote counts much Californian, say all. states realistically flipped allow voters significance go appointment yesterday. showed time, sitting poorly ventilated waiting room 25 minutes watching 3 employees either wearing masks wearing noses, told I‚Äôd wait outside call ready.  clincher: *doctor‚Äôs* office. spread doom put people down. must lead sad life.  Full blown stupid extreme stuff. It'll never happen reality. holes resulted 737 max crashes? Medical knowledge technology come long way 100 years. treated Covid bloodletting, whisky, outdated methods would see huge death toll too. Ok, cool. claimed 99.9% survival rate, link shows 5-10 times made claim.

Thank proving original claim wrong. intervention (layer) imperfections (holes). Multiple layers improve success.

It's sad something obvious needs explicitly stated cute little cheese infographic. Lol aren‚Äôt hiding aren‚Äôt looking right spots. zero chance hell China country able control virus. country originated in, country government controls every aspect citizens life, control goes comes out. don‚Äôt think percentage would based on, think isolated based theoretical risk determined medical professionals. Otherwise, spending planning would lead half assed program doesn‚Äôt work well. get tested without exhibiting symptoms? study certainly limitations. updated comment. saying instead masks use 7 slices Swiss cheese eventually holes cover other? 500 million amount people caught Spanish flu, world population total. Back ~2 billion, ~2.7% population killed Spanish flu, resulting 50 million-ish number.

If 2.7% world population killed COVID-19, would much lower figure estimation roughly 210 million deaths. Luckily still long way go reaching number.

Feel free check math though large portion country can‚Äôt even convinced virus real. politics shifted ‚Äúshould gay people able get medical care?‚Äù ‚Äúdo people deserve executed without trial‚Äù yes, yes fractured. agree also 15-25 year olds (of political backgrounds) don‚Äôt give single shit anyone else don‚Äôt really take virus spreading seriously it‚Äôs fun.  Or, start living normally one would notice difference, k maybe always speed, never check mirrors, never indicate turn never problem, instead relying luck.

It's luck, masks work. reason oblivious drivers get accidents *everyone else around compensating shitty driving*. chance. dont really like watching Joe talk politics, love joes podcast brings interesting people like Graham Handcock Bob Lazar, best podcasts One study found almost 47% Tokyo residents developed antibodies course summer 

If read study, can't really claim 47% Tokyo residents developed antibodies. volunteers one company. 

From Workplace setting within large Healthy volunteers 1877 employees large Japanese company recruited study 11 disparate locations across Tokyo. Participants fever, cough, shortness breath time testing general practice Japan, participants commuted daily workplace: remote working practiced. study several limitations. First, cohort sampling single largecompany Tokyo population, general. Second, detailed medical histories behavioral patterns employee obtained. 

It's requires assumption workers one company somehow statistically representative Tokyo population.

I surprised seropositivity test meat packing workers also saw rise corona wave US. really representative overall population.

Furthermore, look Table 1, distribution volunteers goes 84% male beginning study 37% end study. % participants age 40 goes 23.5% 48.4% end study. % participants age 40 goes 76% 47% end. understand model correctly, we're supposed stuff mouth swiss cheese muffled longer hear them? Again, ""easily-understood"" ""easily-remembered"" rule thumb. Obviously 1 minute less risky 5. There's probably heavy-duty report curves numbers see risk doubles, doubles etc.

There ""line"" cross, super fuzzy. That's cheese slice explanation useful, brings across point multiple ""dials"" tweak minimize risk. Right? ridiculous.

I'm almost hoping troll site. know probably not. let hope people stupid. worse now. remember people taking shit America Iraq. Honestly America looked everyone wanted go there. there's rarely one dreams living US. It‚Äôs going people aren‚Äôt things stop spread, government responses milquetoast best. Look places virus basically gone, like New Zealand. shut shit down, stop people moving goddamn place, reopen.

It could‚Äôve gone away now. I‚Äôm tired propaganda insisting ‚Äúwe live it‚Äôs going away‚Äù face mass disinterest actually taking proactive steps.

You really like ignore obvious things argue things taken context. many younger high risk people dying? %? QUESTION:

I one question, think pretty good handle efficacy number impacts pandemic % population gets immunized changes . question this, efficacy 80%, meaning 20% people received vaccination would still test positive Covid properly exposed, would 20% see severity term Covid never vaccine? words, would vaccine subdue severity infection? Clearly everyone things then. I‚Äôm sure mean. man facetiously impersonating insane r/coronavirus lurker (like yourself), he‚Äôs excellent job. Conservatives trouble math epidemiology France reported almost 30k cases two days row stopped growing stopped testing Spanish flu also 100 years ago.

There's telling would happened Spanish Flu technology (medical, scientific, communications) available today.

Similarly, there's telling situation COVID would look like globally operating 1912 level technology. lol imagine people started go fund recover... believe cases reinfection death, yes. explain nation (Argentina) pretty much 7 months cases still spiking?

It truly blows mind, theoretically right thing believe right thing too.

Psychological damage due extended quarantine often neglected really hard measure, also causing chaos. personal privacy. Nobody access are, meet, free time. unethical current examples companies handle data, easily abused. IIRC NYT bestsellers list 1962 included one named ""The Ugly American"" non-fiction work rest world saw U.S. No. Spain failed these. It‚Äôs really shame beautiful country screwed like this. Testing negative antibodies testing positive coronavirus evidence reinfection. 

Only RNA samples first second infections know new infection.  case less anecdotal others.

At least engineering allowed make go Man first saw thought new, delicious alternative masks proposed 200 countries lower death rates US. Belgium Spain good company. ‚ÄúYou know, made comments dating baseball everything imagine. I'm asking you, said protests increased spread. I'm asking you. try limit protest?‚ÄùJordan asked.

Fauci responded, ‚ÄúI think would leave people position that.‚Äù

-From source

Dr. Fauci exactly person position that. exact point first comment above. say campaign rally risk, shouldn‚Äôt it, worth taking risk. protest also incredibly risky, shouldn‚Äôt it, protesting actually quite important maybe worth taking risk. something cover faces prevent spread airborne substances... Imagine risking life Taco Bell driving. Reasonable speed, spacing, airbags, seat belts, crumple zones, turn signals think everytime someone says ""If masks work six feet? six feet works stay home?""

This idiotic argument. America somehow managed summer though, unlike Europe. I'm sure though. Huh? I‚Äôm wondering people would act like plane full people 20s-40s murder bus.

There‚Äôs nothing wrong acknowledging who‚Äôs affected acting accordingly...sorry hurts old folks‚Äô feelings picking 4. countries US worse than:

That's top really, really long list countries better US. 

You screenshotted top website source make US look better. Here's 200 countries lower death rates (both per capita total death rate) United States. alone. stepdad lactose intolerant famously hates cheese, even going far buy cheeseless pizzas.  


Of course, give endless grief it. So, 6 months? Another year? Two years?

What people sick old get vaccines? wait there's threat them? first time 70 years average life expectancy US dropped 2010, US life expectancy plateaued 2014 began reversing, dropping three consecutive years -- 78.9 years 2014, 78.6 2017. despite US spending health care per capita country Covid19, like shooting fish barrel perfect mean effective. wiping every person, avoiding ""elevator button"" scenarios someone infect many others commonly touched never cleaned surface. even person touched two carts COVID+, there's basically chance they'll infect 10 people via cart circulating day. May memory blessing. People don‚Äôt believe catch virus physically distanced indoors. Authorities levels definitely sending message.  Logically virus go fast first 2 months wasn‚Äôt case? messaging governments risk indoor transmission regardless distancing spend enough time one room?

Edit: add. Like someone else said. Cases like make obvious spreading way. question is: isn‚Äôt messaging authorities? Much bigger, many people government would need isolate would need unemployment addition housing, food necessities due risk level. everyone would need isolated senior citizen, &amp; younger high risk people would still bills pay isolated government‚Äôs expense wear 3 masks time

/s Life completely normal. lockdown, sure, there's restrictions lot places everyone masks. enjoying lack tourists that's damn sure.

And yeah testing pathetic. Tokyo routinely days 7% positivity results. Japan least 50k tests day often even manage 25.

With older population density many transport systems I'd expect testing. lot us (foreigners Japanese alike) feel informed actual case numbers cus testing low.

I say feel endangered I'm happy government's absolutely piss poor testing. fuck Iraq tested Japan? used many places failers really option. one mistake breaks youre whole orginazation progress youre screwed. stereotype New Zealanders bogans lol! fell con. ü§£ü§£ü§£  Poorly designed features, hiding things authorities, letting crews know said features, technical faults obviously 31 January, published experience police station letter admonition social media. following recommendations problem.

It's job know. I'm State Epidemiologist Sweden.

I mean seriously, we're talking random guy street Sweden, we're talking guy whose job ""have idea"" happening regards spread infectious disease. international flights cancelled, don‚Äôt even think flights China cancelled IIRC, Chinese nationals prohibited entry direct China, hop hotspot Italy could fly US there. think China would able 100s dying 1000s testing positive? trust China tell truth no. think could hide age social media. fucking chance.

Ha, Congratulations way. hissy fit downvoting finally flagged get put time making comments. Wild. corporal punishment right now.

The ""comment"" *Nature Reviews Immunology*, yeah, totally useless, refers actual papers inside. 

And question whether virus crosses barrier, antibodies virus do. 

But yeah, absolutely read whole thing understood it. explains greece major wave yet, still warm (Italy cold already) sunny. yep constitutional right practice religion? Serious question: point would concede Sweden handled well?

When 5 11 times covid death rate Nordic Countries.

I mean, guess happy Columbia Argentina even poorly might edge Sweden out, remain one worst countries Europe far, far worse Nordic countries. Hasids generally online. background reading want google it.

Reddit: basic common Trolley Problem standing railyard next train track switch. 5 people tied rails one lines one person tied other. train barreling tracks towards switch five people. throw switch towards one person killing them, leaving position kill 5 people.

There variations scenario. five people railyard workers one random civilian? one person track one got jail? Five year old 65 year old? etc..

&amp;#x200B;

End trolley problem, start explaining similarities.

&amp;#x200B;

While inherently ""philosophy class problem"", thinking give us way think tradeoffs actions. example, could throw switch railyard deliver PPE one doctor instead one civilian. 

The risk doctor dying COVID without PPE much higher due constant exposure, harm dying high unable provide medical care. Therefore, doctor without PPE hugely bad thing.

A civilian without PPE, however huge issue. reducing time spent near people like recommendations stated, washing hands, they...  risk normal person getting disease low, harm normal person getting infected low. 

While true ever one mask, could multiply everything 1,000 1,000,000. every doctor 3 states away 1,000 normal people also 3 states away. every philosophy problem made small scale, questions resource allocation played scales, department hospital get it, state country get it.

As Ted Danson thing, people born funnier others, hit jackpot one. mean.. countries higher daily death rates USA right now..

Didn‚Äôt hear many stories people wuhan flying droves New Zealand staying home allowing visitors enter house/appartment? Fauci says wait 2030 get back normal would follow guidance?

So, asking said something completely ridiculous, say, would follow it?

No. strange question. Man one probably read it‚Äôll get downvoted god damn need vent.

No fucking shit historic proportions. life turned dog shit 8 months there‚Äôs fucking end sight. People already making decisions take affect March 2021 fuck over. 

This may selfish shit cause never got sick fortunately none close family either. terms mean minimize impact COVID-19. bad fucked millions people‚Äôs lives. 

But god damn media really need keep reminding I‚Äôm fucked? open sub news hopefully semblance returning normal doom gloom.

God damn can‚Äôt fucking take anymore. want life back. can‚Äôt get last 8 months life back lost opportunities never come back again. cannot regain part life pick next year. It‚Äôs over.

Fuck. People acting like ""NoTHeR fLu"" never truly understood viruses, pandemics, vaccination first place. 

It's exactly even contra safety measures groups everything. 

Imagine thinking preventing untreatable sickness spreading counter productive. 

This extension antivax movement. Stupid gets stupider. Thanks top that, almost certainly level resistance virus lasts period time. That‚Äôs vaccine works, isn‚Äôt case Covid really big trouble.

Agreed, that's reason feel like really important keep track relapses see whether that's actually happening not. Wait hay particles get simply milking cow, added point?  Economists nothing businessmen.. anything money flow market system externalities. Economy ever science factually not. He's upvoted now, probably misleading- need possible data therapeutic's phase II justify phase III, possible data phase II imply anything efficacy regarding phase III. He's talking ass Uh, correct. Vaccine induced neutralizing antibodies well immune responses like CD8+ cell response play much stronger role natural infection. affect vaccine development? Maybe clade end reinfections, absolutely good are. eat cheese? Hmm ...avoid laughed bunch dumbshits staying alive. Choices choices. cases beginning pandemic underestimated 50x Europe. underestimated 15x crazy NY. know official reported cases GROSS underestimate. coming back cold weather. sure plan works. particular instance carrier covered insurance although carriers were. 

But given dying, like family could shop around. sane person is.  fact even consider possibility improved therapies providing solution would suggest particular political stripe sees everything either vaccine-or-nothing. things still remote. India teams can't work things security contractual reasons, need people similar time zones help support software used US business hours. We've fully remote two years now. Certain political people can‚Äôt say publicly corona dangerous. would hurt fascist tendencies harm narcissistic mind. *a ploy democrats control population.*

Still sounds like post hoc fallacy sample generally high mask use, reason stated. wasn‚Äôt aware protecting citizens death made someone tyrant. that‚Äôs qualifies tyranny guess that‚Äôs preferred form government. need someone I'm close die order take disease seriously.

People world taking disease seriously without personally affected.

The issue anti-intellectualism. Saying ""its human problem"" lie. Society taking note people take disease seriously, receive significantly less empathy turn. Adjusted population Sweden right behind Italy death rate. bad thought would good either. Comments impossible 'non-political debate' pretty dumb. definitely debate without politics. 

The people think impossible non-political debate ones damn politics. 

Left wing thinkers: Close businesses quarantine. 

Right wing thinkers: Fuck Covid, keep businesses open. 

Non-political thinkers: find middle ground keep economy well people safe. clear scientist, anyone speak authority this. I'd suggest visiting r/COVID19 educating yourself, pretty clearly garnered bad assumptions. halt trials illness. 

This research article; comment, basically editorial.

The claim editorial makes research done topic.

The concept virus crossing blood/brain barrier disputed studies. Abortion kills embryos fetuses, coronavirus kills already born people. Lockdowns work wonderfully, about? 

Lockdowns aren‚Äôt meant eradicate virus.

Is right solution right now? don‚Äôt know.

For example, Spanish Flu estimated infected 1/3 world's population. means 2/3rds never got it. Social distancing, masks, etc slow prevent spread.

""These results indicated vitro enhancement SARS-CoV-2 infection patient plasma mediated IgG antibodies engagement Fc RII receptor, similar ADE virus infections including SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, Zika, dengue viruses."" yeah, thing sucks. Well, metaphor, no. People really think large slices cheese prevent viral outbreaks. Dentists surgeons wear every day hours time, entire professional life. bad anyone. faint fall patients :) No. personally relatively young, young swine flu. live elderly people. lost education chances, work twice seen partner year now. someone almost zero risk die covid, wish life would already return normal. fun job education goes clear end sight. 
No one cared flu before. Risk groups always protected own. willing take chances allowed so. Besides keep 1st world living stardards pace half permanently jobless? We're hurtling towards second lockdown, hardly anyone seems care. 

Prisoner's dilemma. one cares, caring makes difference making life worse. So. safe? not?
And questions
Can get infected covid got vaccinated?
Can vaccine infecting us covid instead protecting us covid? injecting ourself virus right?
Whats worst thing could happen injected vaccine?

Not antivax. curious Abstract

Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) reported several virus infections including dengue fever virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus infection. study whether ADE involved COVID-19 infections, vitro pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 entry Raji cells, K562 cells, primary B cells mediated plasma recovered COVID-19 patients employed models. enhancement SARS-CoV-2 entry cells commonly detected plasma severely-affected elderly patients high titers SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-specific antibodies. Cellular entry mediated via engagement FcŒ≥RII receptor virus-cell membrane fusion, endocytosis. Peptide array scanning analyses showed antibodies promote SARS-CoV-2 infection targeted variable regions RBD domain. characterize association spike-specific antibody ADE, RBD-specific monoclonal antibody (7F3) isolated recovered patient, potently inhibited SARS-Cov-2 infection ACE-2 expressing cells also mediated ADE Raji cells. Site-directed mutagenesis spike RBD domain reduced neutralization activity 7F3, abolish binding RBD domain. Structural analysis using cryo-electron microscopy (Cryo-EM) revealed 7F3 binds spike proteins shift-angled pattern one two RBDs, resulting partial overlapping receptor binding motif (RBM), neutralizing monoclonal antibody lacked ADE activity binds spike proteins three RBDs, resulting complete overlapping RBM. results revealed ADE mediated SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific antibodies could result binding receptor slightly different pattern antibodies mediating neutralizations. Studies ADE using antibodies recovered patients via cell biology structural biology technology could use developing novel therapeutic preventive measures control COVID-19 infection. So, use model, still required wear mask? I'm everything else, I'll still punished one thing. Ok, I'm going start asking cites. Something recent, early cases. 

Your numbers getting pretty crazily outrageous. I've seen basically covid deniers claiming 12X nuts, like people trump administration. . European Medicines Agency already started approval process Oxford/AZ's Pfizer/BioNTech's candidates. Politics really feature EU's bureaucracy. political motivation have? Tbh five months isn‚Äôt world beating it‚Äôs ok far bizarre state affairs. We're missing big piece puzzle. Wow. point arguing you. clearly mentally challenged. can't comprehend get cancer getting care need due hospitals keeping empty beds case covid surge focusing manpower covid know tell you.

### Summary

**What already known topic?**

Community mitigation measures help slow spread COVID-19.

**What added report?**

The number COVID-19 cases Arizona stabilized decreased sustained implementation enforcement statewide locally enhanced mitigation measures, beginning approximately 2 weeks implementation enforcement mask mandates enhanced sanitations practices began June 17; decreases observed July 13‚ÄìAugust 7, statewide limitations closures certain services businesses.

**What implications public health practice?**

Widespread implementation enforcement sustained community mitigation measures, including mask wearing, informed state local officials‚Äô continual data monitoring collaboration help prevent transmission SARS-CoV-2 decrease numbers COVID-19 cases. Show precisely CDC put official number mortality rate. process engineering, also use Swiss cheese model. focus slapping cheeses line (having inherently safe design, passive safety user much) Italy here: masks mandatory everywhere indoors outdoors can‚Äôt social distance; work home possible; bars need close 12. public gatherings except protests. Advise invite 6 ppl home. got tested last week got results back 24 hours. know what's hilarious - quoting Karl Popper middle pandemic everything moving light speed attempt limit loss life catastrophic damage global economy realize big influence good buddy George Soros... Yeah, many Covid-19 makes worse trigger. people simply tested.

Don‚Äôt know this? time cartoonish graphic made top sub, ended utter lie Humans aren‚Äôt meant socially distance. starting damage virus itself. Ridiculous. typical attitude ""I'm ok deaths long die"" Calling it. time over, average Jack/Jill break couple bones comes crying governor mayor whatever order new lockdown Jack/Jill fully recovers. growing human population comes human deaths i'd rather bored home nothing vs covid People intuitively understanding greatest annoyance year. think focusing fact many people many different states gathered together long stretches time without practicing three main preventative measures have: masks, social distancing, avoiding physical contact. negative tests clearly weren‚Äôt enough. That‚Äôs lesson learn here. people complaining breathing cheesecloth masks they're wearing, wait till put N95 enforce mask policy? kind scummy organization would allow that? i'll pray really think 100k die April? know experts? ones write papers. Sorry cult made waste money. get reinfected, say efficacy potential vaccines? thought antibodies virus supposed act like vaccine sense.  Nice! 3 4 days getting test around 48 hours result. testing way developed, netherlands btw. Sturgis bike rally lot this. Midwest holding pretty strong every trash biker country decided yolo God forbid miss seeing Smashmouth play live set. I‚Äôm referring period shit really hit fan US lockdowns started American rather embarrassing. Yea they're gaslighting us. Posted last week, therapist got tested last week thought covid symptoms came back negative Wednesday thought everything good.

Heard last night got retested weekend came back positive. 

She‚Äôs young I‚Äôm worried worst case scenario. anyone know there‚Äôs data supposed heart damage failure showing bunch mild cases like couple months ago? That‚Äôs thing I‚Äôm worried right now. Emoji allowed titles. Make new submission plain text title.

Most death statistics skewed initial response/first waves useful postmortem analysis terribly indicative countries containing spreads wait vaccines available No, want give scientists chance develop vaccine immunise vulnerable. honestly bother all. I've brigaded before. depends sub. thanks support, appreciated. think denial big thing.

yeah right. 

You likes AOC using pandemic push socialist agenda. (""Nationalize Hospitals"") topic, like global warming, long ago politicized, weaponized. Yup fucked up, tonight get new restrictions (that prob wont enough like last 2 times) hope difference measured additional-deaths-due-to-his-visits :/ doubt need call everyone tries help stupidity troll.

Grow up. americaespecially calling suicides covid deaths. deborah birx even said covid deaths means died covid. covid killed yoi interesting, thanks! know taste like smells, right? cheese shops smell like dirty angels feet, stinky garbage like euphemism. total disconnect aroma flavor. even home, making parmigan. smell ""bad"" taste good Swiss cheese whole time ü§î...huh That's true. quite interesting powerful Andy Burnham national media compared Khan. He's everywhere making decent points even agree him. Khan nowhere putting press releases stating blindingly obvious.

Part thinks typing given know Boris PM disgrace garden bridge least Boris mayor seemed achieve _some_ things, even perfect. I'm genuinely struggling remember Khan achieved four years. think would significantly decrease much fast spreads? Cases...

I talking individual citizens. Governors using agencie's advisors make deicsions citizens. Regular citizens that. Like you, ignore misinterpret Governments...

Holy shit lol called it. fact...

You must hate safety laws existence huh? Literally every single law made protect people limits freedom. Smoking, seatbelts, helmets, osha, yelling fire movie theater, saying bomb air plane, everything. look similar summer Sun Belt. Rise cases testing, moderate, proportional rise deaths. Lockdowns less likely used again. Mask mandates likely continue lot places, perhaps renewed restrictions gatherings businesses, pushed back heavily holidays important retail. Compliance measures continue wane people fatigued want normal holiday experience. Political discourse change tune bit election. explain deaths sunbelt states, least restrictive lockdowns, skyrocketed lockdowns ended. anything, looks like active efforts states minimize deaths attributed COVID-19 saying caused something else justify quick reopenings. also happen correlate well large increases COVID-19 cases/deaths reopenings states. weak disappeared within half year Moderna! seem like big deal? Vaccines 100% effective? mean Christiano Coronaldo Pretty much last place want pandemic (especially half top 10 infected countries North/Central/South America) working internet cafe Latin America everything...I‚Äôm feeling right now... used big time livestock, tropical countries often given people parasite infections. also, spent decades trying figure wrong health. I've become pretty adept understanding medical lingo issue looking things first understand. find important intellectually challenging various autoimmune diseases cause brain function issues. figure I'll make much neuroplasticity can, way increase function really hard stuff. 

I love science much background outside core curriculum college. probably make bigger effort understand study design. happened while, times I've found issues difference facts presented conclusions reached. knew metrics use, could confident that, say, large cohort study actually means something.  Holy moly! idea poster talking about. Half shit getting deleted mod. 

We talking 1 25 year olds strokes due Covid. 

You talking older people strokes (earlier life) due Covid claiming ""out science me"". 

Repeat.

We talking children 25 years old stroking Covid.

Do kids?

 assure data shows middle aged people strokes earlier thing data showing large proportion trend Covid positive children strokes.

The distinction importat.

 far, data backing OP's claim many children strokes. 

If is, fact, true, might start social distancing within household.

Do see big deal is? 4 posts later.... nowhere Monday's ruling means hundreds thousands Michiganders could lose unemployment benefits ""in matter days,"" Whitmer spokeswoman Tiffany Brown said. 

No lots people start feeling pain days. Look man, you‚Äôre going fear monger you‚Äôre going like it. accept reinfection happen everybody regardless immune system strength. Ex-motorcyclist? Well common sense, catch COVID way. People take flu shots effective rates 40 60%. lower effective rate prevent people taking vaccine, prompt us paint picture waste time.  ""irreverent"" lol Ya, considered contagious worn mask right thing do, easy do, everyone else wearing one, importantly, would put people ease. people isolated house 100% time know covid sure still wear mask. right thing make others feel better. don‚Äôt believe it. data unreliable inflated. believe NONE it. gunshot victims died virus, believe none lies. Can‚Äôt surprised...[TN pandemic hope you‚Äôve made okay, you‚Äôre nearly this. 

I‚Äôm NSW, we‚Äôve much ‚Äòeasier‚Äô - watch news daily, looking see figures heading right direction. You‚Äôve collectively right things, getting right outcomes. Closed state international borders come cost, despite unable see family overseas interstate - I‚Äôm absolutely happy level border control Australia has, quarantine procedures (now!) place. 

The UK could exactly terms borders, quarantine - seemingly chooses to. aside, right mind decided sensible fuck Europe holiday .... that‚Äôs going move virus about!! literally says pandemic, virus. 

The pandemic many parts it. poster said woman stayed home *because afraid go hospital*. every indication knew happening scared go fear getting sick. sure allows getting cases ICU less severe still serious

Except recommended intubate patients possible (at least France), outcome worse patients. Germany probably same. nobody send many people possible ICU, far limit capacity ICU EU countries moment. Germany ICU beds irrelevant moment. Wow thank stating this! stated many times /r/politics people state negative test requirement release someone isolation. not. People test positive weeks even months. 

Finally, voice reason. Excess deaths. fucking definitely thing. basically ruling meaningless? Who‚Äôs ‚Äúwe‚Äù? Insert South Park reference Non-US redditors: thoughts hear skeptics saying ‚Äúend soon Nov 3rd election over?‚Äù US 300 million people large high-risk population, im saying handled well admit odds stacked us comes virus. mean, know heart attack feels like? Plenty people go thinking they're heart attack turns heartburn/reflux. reverse also true. Ah you‚Äôre trolling. Got it. motorcycle killed entire family tropical fish tank. counted covid deaths, even fancy guppies. couldn‚Äôt stay home work. use public transportation throughout whole thing. sold us groceries. wearing masks. medical care absolutely impact. Lower income areas also lack access medical care lowere education levels. hardest hit. thoseare Democratic led cities. 

The level playing field demographics area along Covid rates. 

There plethora articles talking issue. ""Doesn't total always exceed sum parts?""

By definition, no. understand ramifications choices. great philosopher said ""never attribute malice easily explained apathy"" something along lines conclusive data showing people mostly get from? 

Bars? Stores? Restaurants?

House parties? Yes, thank stating this. tried tell people /r/politics group actually banned so! Everyone said still contagious go jail spreading covid. 

The truth is, past isolation period, likely contagious (considered contagious) tens thousands people like released isolation every day.

He wearing mask right thing good role modeling would likely make people around comfortable. Unfortunately mask mandate aware may technically breaking law there. considered contagious; people like returning families (not wearing masks) told around others, cases living roommates others can't wear mask. allowed isolation really unsafe so. I'm sure European guy introduced covid19 USA walked Europe USA... Arizona pretty much always counts nothing weekend catches Tuesday. getting lot better course doubt one died Yes yes deflect say I'm alt fit narrative.. 2008 - 2019 average deaths attributed pneumonia per year: 55,000 ([source [source [source January - October 12: 200,000 Pneumonia Influenza deaths % Influenza Season Week 18 (Approximately last week April/first week May)

Hope real data Well tell truth don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs actually included ‚Äúdeath rate‚Äù comment personal opinion covid-related me. haven‚Äôt looked death rate calculated. Anyone source? ensure terrible. taken empty stomach sugar cause nausea. meal replacements, sugar drinks. amount crap causes gas well laxative effect. start bland foods like rice fish/chicken light seasoning, look diets crohns disease/IBD. sugar poison. grandmother husband‚Äôs grandmother died last 6 months. Suddenly one allowed visit nursing homes declined rapidly (in totally different cities). imagine lot older people died since March directly due COVID. Hey, clearly read comment, I'll repeat utter New York City's ENTIRE population died every man, woman, child NYC infected (not even close, obviously!) would STILL .28% so, so, wrong.

Adding in, FUCK say .13% .28% NYC's ENTIRE population died it? hell wrong you? quote suspect estimates, real-world results thta very, wrong. Well covid win round 1 It‚Äôs Trump forced hospitals send data directly instead CDC. skew data. Lucky us, going away Nov. 4 like magic. 

/s boss called entire office sheeple today, recent college graduate henchman felt need explain sheeple was.... pretty self explanatory. bartender works pub shut sure lockdown yeah that's math pointed now. Absent working vaccine, minimum 60% Americans would get infected achieve herd immunity. 

So, 60% 328MM Americans infected equates ~198MM Americans. apply CDC's suggested Infection Fatality Rate 0.65 1%, indicates total 1.287MM Americans killed COVID, 1MM we've suffered already.

Of course assumptions everything breaks way. Numerous studies indicate likely COVID require 75% infections herd immunity; we're unlucky may resemble measles requiring 90%. Also may instructive look Case Fatality Rate U.S. currently 2.8%. implies America would add 5 million additional deaths.

TLDR: without vaccine, herd immunity answer  Yes - true. lab Iowa tracing mutations meat packing plants basically proven direction spread plant plant utilizing this. still yet proved fruitful working plants legal terms however.

Here article:  love people call googling research. satire flagged estimates 750 million people infected worldwide: Economist similar findings - estimating around 600 million based serological studies: numbers give IFR low side range, assuming 1.08M worldwide COVID-19 deaths. course deaths worldwide likely underreported.

Washington Post (and others) reporting ~9% U.S. exposed virus. would give IFR around 0.7% (215K / (328M * 0.09), little outside range quoted: debate provide sources. masks work. easy prove. Put mask try blow candle. good mask even make candle flicker. That's work, decreasing spread velocity exhaled breath. But, made mind seems.  Info rapid tests reputable /u/nythro posting alt accounts again? sounds like Gave best answers allthough usa ^^

 trust scientists, politicians doctor, etc. country (norway) this, much usa big countries handled crisis terribly. intentions never pure. Bill Gates. person depositions 90's could understand Monopoly could possibly ""a bad thing"". mean talking person could change world really used money, doesn't, always finishes another money making scheme. going downvote - it‚Äôs interesting read views. believe timing couldn‚Äôt much worse UK, almost half UK (if more) / pissed Brexit last General Election results - naturally dismiss / activity government take (or don‚Äôt).

Do think people making interpretations rules guidelines contributing rough ride you‚Äôve outlined?

I‚Äôm lucky I‚Äôm currently living country handling Covid much better UK: Covid hasn‚Äôt politicised, it‚Äôs citizens pretty much: ‚Äúwe‚Äôre together, we‚Äôll whatever need get together‚Äù. Sure, argue every decision &amp; guideline - however, much minority - they‚Äôre practically inaudible compared see across UK social media.

Out interest, scientists suggested following measures (among others) UK, well would received?:


- banning contact inside homes members households

- closing bars, restaurants, cafes, indoor gyms hairdressers

- requiring university college teaching take place online Alternative facts

Edit /s live Boston. think thoughts education medical care apply here, yet hit hard. think categorize NYC way either. masks recommended mandated, infections dropped dramatically. Again, learn address public health issue. Every city would level playing field get accurate comparison.

We‚Äôre laughing stock world point. would take cash day. ...do point make? so, say loud. hint it. Source? we‚Äôre closer 300k deaths rather 250k? Mr. Tischler, talk radio personality, expected charged inciting riot 

I think that‚Äôs likely correct charge, say, I‚Äôve read lot news articles year first time I‚Äôve seen one mention someone charged that. Maybe missed it, that‚Äôs thing charge people with, might using different standards based think speech surrounding rioting. Ireland part EU also agreement UK. can‚Äôt close borders like NZ can. would test whole city 9 million 12 people?

Yes? That‚Äôs supposed control pandemic. 

With logic, US really like 5000 covid cases that‚Äôs response looks like absolutely haven't. That's actually great way understand political behavior motivations, actually *follow* lead anywhere. Many women know heart attacks pain equal period cramps, perspective different. also different symptoms men, realize front either. Definitely that, look excess deaths are.

You know else advantageous position, WHO? Taiwan üáπüáº Cervical cancer aggressive it‚Äôs hard watch, especially it‚Äôs caught late. I‚Äôve seen young women die cervical cancer looks extremely painful. friend holding hope. Data??? needs data hope! information. Beijing outbreak June, handled weeks. 3rd July, China NHC NZ ministry health held video conference virus. think shows NZ really motivated get top it. I'm surprised keep improving.  That‚Äôs end two year study Pfizer, EUA approval sought November. element truth that. Funny timing, that. Tass, source reliable news else. two weeks away ! promised !  Maybe could establish world government colonize another planet. least good couple hundred years, new planet would largely egalitarian. LOL WHAT!?! Covid killed twice many people year 6 months flu pneumonia combined took entire year. Holy shit really dense skull. bet one 2 brain cell idiots look CDC graph comorbidities think 10k people died Covid. mean tell someone CEO ice cream company turned sellout can't manage pandemic?

Color surprised. right...the metric personally using success global well being, global quality adjusted life years. Lockdowns definitely disproportionately harmful low income countries low income individuals. deaths I've described 5-10x QALY loss compared covid deaths. US, half unattributed excess deaths (45000) year lockdown deaths, would exceed QALY lost due covid. state? I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs part whatever anti-vaxx Trump religion she‚Äôs in. long make Fanduel Draftkings lineup gamble it, I'm in. Deaths despair significantly year, well. Pfizer still field expected go review November. proper lockdown eyes? IIRC, Sinopharm used traditional method making vaccine require fancy new technology like many ones hearing doing. example, Oxford using adenovirus, never approved, Moderna mRNA, etc, Sinopharm basic route. Given long many people gotten it, would believe efficacy, least side effects. doctor's letter said quit taking fever reducers 10/9. fever past 24 hours, used fever reducers past 24 hours, symptoms resolving, 10 days. see problem going back work (except still wearing mask, hate work is). Sure could lying, anyone gets covid could lying get back work. US relies self reported symptoms, that's system. Apparently theyre like bees help pollinate crops agree article never written didn‚Äôt get confirmed PCR her. I‚Äôm sure didn‚Äôt didn‚Äôt even widespread testing March. Yeah, i'd say that's probably safe bet may underrated truest comment I've ever read. defend argument? I‚Äôve brought multiple times come ‚Äújust would doesn‚Äôt mean happens‚Äù *Almost covid free lol, sure. You‚Äôre still missing point all. Covid deadly seasonal flu data confirms that.

**People denying existence extra money COVID deaths. It‚Äôs fact.**

*We argue day fraud exists not, considered COVID death, somewhat opinionated. denying facts makes guys look like crazy ones.* relaxation restrictions kick number back one

The Lakers winning well People live far apart.

I SD. Sure, Manhattan.

But Spearfish much city Oneida, NY. think pandemic showing us useless science reporting - part. Journalists seem focus fear-based narratives, point omitting facts create sort story. 

Their info wrong, however, decision err side caution unwarranted. need scary well hopeful information.  Well, bats' fault... people insist going caves. Yep, happened grandpa. grandpa already limited mobility due polio infancy. Indeed. can't things control. bullshit   bullshit Hey u/baconface2736! scrolling sub noticed username. chatted bit back forth another sub waaaaay back first getting started. you‚Äôre - still posting helpful formative news.

I hope well you. nice seeing familiar name. February feels like lifetime ago. Yes, exactly. People getting assaulted regular occurrence. worried grandpa. dealt major depression earlier pandemic, first time life according him. It‚Äôs sad elderly suffered most. honestly think saw TV know names. Terrible reason vote someone, live Kardashian culture fame alone gives voice. heard far many people use ‚Äúhospitals get extra funding calling COVID death even wasn‚Äôt‚Äù anyone tried true response shuts argument down?? conducted properly, testing process inherently slow.

Money can't fix that. never it. Every person thinks March. think regular occurrence people getting assaulted? \*Passes Covid 19 l;bs le epic style\* grandfather, lived far away mother (who nearby) could see week brief visit. I've already explained it.

Trials expedited can't be.

They performed sequence be.

The reason typically takes decade bring vaccine market testing process rigorous. means slow. many US soldiers there. second time best calling child wanting told truth? Bullshit. enlightened, must spent lot time China. think show anti-mask anti-lockdown idiots getting heads bashed none idiots. logic you. Actually family got tested around 1 hour ago think that‚Äôs funny, see portfolio. would want manage yours, guaranteed. FlU ShEePpLEEEEE They'll need better excuse lol.

You know, things kill large amount people side quickly. with? Never history public health herd immunity used strategy responding outbreak

/thread can't compare Stage III trials process expedited due political motivation.

Under normal circumstances, none Stage III trials would underway even completed Stage II portion taken enough time review results.  Trials typically take least year performed order. I‚Äôve never seen dumber argument here. that‚Äôs *really* saying something. rock climbing accident, ice snow melting, coming down, came it.

Edit: oh jeez saw grammar error. wanted point know someone died cases. Big true Communists. that's thing. U.S. never really lockdowns. asked stay home unless go work. tons people go work. Plenty businesses labeled essential. time, many non essential business came ways open safely.

A lot anti-lockdown protesters also allowed march towns states, armed guns government buildings.

""Lockdowns"" lol. Lol dude

you mean /u/thesandsofrhyme? oh know, pathological need constant validation drives aspects stupid society lol zombie apocalypse starts. Downstate towards Indiana I've got family bunch Trump anti-maskers. never taken seriously. Cases nursing homes, prison HS football team folks parties, traveling etc wearing masks. high number cases relative population worse lot lother places likely get bad I'm afraid. like best hospitals country. Fingers crossed. 

All news focusing high population states cities really leads rural people thinking something far away need worry about. course Trump tells harmless... guess harm black people racial profiling, main subject we're talking jewish community OP complying rules. ask Jeeves one man's mistake another man's win... something Fair. accept conclusion implies millions wont access therapeutics. think point give though. normal, pandemics ended history. pandemic &amp; it‚Äôs measures ever come end it‚Äôs *perfectly* safe everyone so. need make sure point comes, decent level protection breaking point - believe next summer. 

I believe 75% effective vaccine x 75% population getting vaccinated get us level protection. won‚Äôt perfectly safe. people still get sick. think brings risk level move mandated restrictions personal risk mitigation (also consider fact even though vaccine may X% effective sterilization, anything like flu vaccine provide severity reduction 100% cases). move goalposts election. \+1

also, really point out,

In**flu**enza. Aka ""I right infect people like job income cast streets I'm selfish want cause economic devastation"" percentage means probably know someone died though. It‚Äôs deaths clustered non-uniformly. ""taken"" That's looking ""open"" ""shutdown"" viewpoint pandemic. can't either 100%

You allow people buy food get gas, etc. things get REALLY bad. 

And opens debate, allow open say shutdown. immediately think simple open close, not.

This really win situation think everyone needs understand that. county I'm staying moment huge spike school year started. closed ONE day started back up. Also football shit going strong like nothing. 

Back home town homeschooling option daycare ain't guarantee people still going daily. 

I'd put money Sturgis. 

Had bike rally none regular cashiers came sickness three weeks daily exposure (most maskless cause 'murica). Sure is, correct measures tracking place

Hi Atlantic Canada like Wuhan crematoriums running 24 hours day also ‚Äúmedical waste‚Äù incinerators put around place well.
A lot people died, think far reported government China taking many risks Haha. Everyone knows it‚Äôs female steeple. person took time provide fleshed first hand response clearly read every ounce prejudice told stop saw words ""South Florida"", try big time him?


I truly enjoy false sense superiority intelligence many people purely read reddit thread titles context news headlines 92%, even hit stage 3 trials like ones have. IIRC success rate stage 3 around 50% mods snowflakes. can‚Äôt say anything openly anymore Americans still refuse wear masks, lol.

No wonder guys voted Trump presidency.  solution.

There ""should"". vaccine, vaccine.

Reality care hope happen.

The reality therapies far realistic shot becoming viable. know already starting happen, plus vaccine programs fail deliver.

The fact Americans idiotic approach healthcare change this. 11 new cases Hong Kong yesterday. Says you, truth gatekeeper.

The original post made Florida's peak. beat curve social distancing mask wearing, commended so. That's still \*a lot deaths\* -- CDC puts Florida #11 among states per-capita deaths, #5 total deaths -- could lot worse.

They're still hot zone, though. Epidemiologists concerned social distancing measures fall apart cold weather sets in, Florida concern never gets cold there. They've probably worst it; knock wood. think Chicago relatively flat months, downstate seeing big increase. info may old. 22. 

But here's thing - 40 million like said, small amount people illness genetically sequenced twice, different strains time (to prove residual first infection). 

You spouting false information. mods delete comments.

EDIT: right commented, turns 23rd confirmed case, also first case person dying second time got it. USA Today lost credibility long ago. DYOR. experience, think rough percentage deaths mis-attributed COVID? keep talking countries successful. course, everyone would love that.

You keep talking like lockdowns responsible failures that's majority world forced playing lottery

What lottery? Name one country failed flatten curve lockdown.

Also, going address obvious lies regarding unemployment famine? First all, said likely multiple strains SARS-CoV-2 totally unsubstantiated honestly shows grasp science here. could literally stop I'll continue. Also, speculated confirmed reinfections immunocompromised individuals way, also totally unsubstantiated.

""Our immune system response common cold flawed, internal immunity vaccination possible""

This also ridiculous statement. ""flawed"" immune response common cold? produce antibodies T-cell responses common cold coronaviruses, basically never cause serious disease humans. antibody responses durable, prevent periodic reinfection. Immune function balancing act - requires lot energy spent metabolic functions, even *want* kind immune response provides durable sterilizing immunity common cold coronaviruses.

It's coronaviruses either. polio vaccine still allows infection replication gut. reinfected enteroviruses like coxsackie well. reinfected Dengue. reinfected Ebola. immune system, generally, permits reinfection viruses, parasites, bacteria. tons tons examples.

And like commenter said, mean vaccination possible. Sterilizing immunity immunity disease two different concepts. See polio vaccine example above.

You're also greatly exaggerating efficacy convalescent plasma treatments. studies shown pretty modest benefit achieved early treatment.

"" virus studied scientists 10 months now. full genetic sequence, electronic microscope photos, understand structure virus, proteins has, mechanisms attacks body. Scientists also generally understand body‚Äôs immune response works. ""

This also completely irrelevant. Yes sequence microscope images, understanding viral immune kinetics. still know answer big questions, like ""why people get severe disease others not?"" ""what median infectious dose virus?"" ""what correlates protection virus?"" ""what causes significant percentage individuals get chronically ill infection virus?"" No, 4000 excess average ""Swedish deaths"" last 5 years. Totally unrelated covid numbers. Makes sense, 6000 dies covid, fewer dies traffic, flu. Also lots covid deaths really old people would died next month anyway... 

If applied US, think excess deaths 300 000? Swedish statistics would hold US, would mean 400 000 covid deaths. that's probably oversimplifying lot. It‚Äôs common Midwest, less Northeast. Still, pediatrician DO. also choose offered option, although it‚Äôs years since I‚Äôve it. acquaintance mine kept mentioning hospitals near fluffing COVID-19 cases get money. ignored first, kept bringing asked article. told article covered up.

That's bare minimum countries did. US didn't, leadership countries also used positive reinforcement instead shaming people continued stress lockdowns temporary measure.

I think that's true. NZ imposed fines people caught wearing places like US pretended COVID would disappear SPH orders lasted long enough everything else could go back ""normal.""

I actually Circuit Breaker strict compared Vietnam China, even strict NZ Melbourne Aus matter. fines mixing households wearing masks, people could still go outside long meeting anyone.

All non-essential businesses closed. Even essential ones like mental health services shut down. Schools closed. Work home basically enforced workers.

Cases going again.

Man keep telling winter going suck difficult hopefully March better place..... need serious reality check think wel never get together again. Life went back normal small pox, polio, Spanish flu, shit even bubonic plague little medical knowledge . I‚Äôm pretty sure deal advance technology knowledge human history states governors Canada. Exceeded US. Oh come on. least people garages could reduce traffic gyms minimum, seriously need looking moving exercise outdoors. Sure, winter hits Midwest need better solutions, fact people aren‚Äôt looking negligent. solution can‚Äôt go pack gyms.  know one person got Covid, months later he's still able go biking despite hardcore cyclist pre-infection.

Therefore logical conclusion 100% people infected Covid get long-term lung damage. Last week positive tests 14%, week before- 10%. Belgium 7.5% week ago. Wonder would different outdoor cycling class. exercise might produce lot CO2 metabolic water, ventilation extra layer protection outdoors offers think time Trump leaves office (January), late mandate anything.  RLF-100 (aviptadil) really work like individuals though? distancing, ventilation finally masks fail virus gets via inhaling, hand hygiene really effect. I'm sick tired people always bringing New Zealand every thread pretending US new Zealand comparable Ohhhh help line bedn getting lit past week know common trials, sure people going use excuse take vaccine/medication fully tested available public.

Oh yes, America's medical system known giving vulnerable people access healthcare. read article?

Prime Minister Mark Rutte explains tightening coronary measures Netherlands.Beeld ANP
Actually, we're going partial lockdown,' said concerned Rutte. get virus control again, drastically reduce number social contacts travel movements. That's hard message, measures also hurt. way. facts lie. strict stricter behavior.

The cabinet therefore taking series measures combat rapid rise number infections. measures take effect Wednesday evening 10 p.m. According Rutte, 'we mainly looked measures reduce social traffic, without compromising crucial social sectors'.

First all, cafes restaurants close again. tough one, can't get around it,' says Rutte. number clusters infections hospitality industry relatively limited, 'but immediately involves large groups lots contact moments. still pick food. Hotels stay open serve food drinks guests'.

For stores outlets ban sale alcohol eight o'clock evening, 'to prevent pub moving street'. also ban drinking alcohol public places alcohol eight o'clock evening.

The group size goes maximum thirty people per room indoor spaces people sit. Wednesday onwards longer exemptions specific concert halls theaters. Exceptions churches, demonstrations democratic bodies Lower House. Exceptions also made work situations.

For groups maximum size four people inside outside belong one household. Children age 13 excluded. 'will maintain extra', said Rutte. Four four, discussion.

Behind front door already urgent advice maximum three guests per household. cabinet adding rule maximum one group per day. celebrate birthday new guests every hour. block birthdays'.

Group sports four people banned, like contact sports. Individual sports remain possible, even gym. Children young people age 18 may continue play sports team, competitions shut order limit travel movements reduce number contacts. public also remain prohibited amateur professional sports. Professional soccer thus 'continue current footing'.

Events banned. broad. outdoor concerts neighborhood barbecues theater festivals fairs'. stores line buying evenings. Also, stores must close eight o'clock evening, rule apply supermarkets. also strict maximum number customers per store. see spot things going well all, getting crowded, example, store closed immediately.

Then mouth caps. order 'settle protracted discussion all', non-medical mouthpieces become compulsory 'anyone age thirteen moving around public indoor space', stores, museums theaters. obligation also apply education secondary school onwards, moving classes lectures. mouthpiece obligation legally laid down, urgent advice apply.

It's us,' concluded Rutte. stubborn person looks edges rules. realistic Dutchman stands takes responsibility comes it. that's now.

As mentioned another post, NZ highly direct terms lockdown; NZ government kept public informed gave exact date lockdown would lifted, actually able lift earlier planned! use vague terms like ""flatten curve"" people waiting months welfare unemployment. countries also used positive reinforcement instead shaming people continued stress lockdowns temporary leaders combat clear strategy intended goals. achieve minimizing community spread.

Minimizing community spread keeping minimized comes clear strategy exact goals; keep community spread without consistent coherent strategy.

At least they're using total deaths. I'd guess viruses pretty similar, live much ""global"" world today travel probably makes worse. positive test 14%, target 3-5%. Germany 1%. Netherlands tests actually 14 times less Germany. double numbers infections 5 times less population.

According Netherlands second worst eu. *Ay caramba el bicho good succinct piece information embarrassing we're 10 months still struggling communicate basic concepts like X% population always try make situation actively worse.

I cannot understand you. know realize lost keep crying save whatever pathetic ego left. hope time week reality finally sets ignorant science. hope long look e mirror change that. sadly, liberal, likely keep fear mongering openly showing world ignorant science, like shown here. Good day. Nobody would argue point. But, hand, available hospital beds equal 'ability care patients'. relatively easy repurpose space move beds around. sufficient staffing keep patients safe different story. 

That particularly true need intensive care unit. ICU nurses, respiratory therapists (RT), etc cannot conjured thin air. situation becomes even serious members teams looking COVID patients start getting sick themselves.

Two factors come play planning hospital capacity COVID patients: 1) average COVID patient needs stay ICU longer ICU patients; 2) care severely ill COVID patients require extraordinary number staff (e.g. sometimes require six eight people flip paralyzed, intubated patient belly help breath.

do admit made deaths falling week, since week done data available? Batch testing works much better positive rate low.

Oops! Gotta get 'em straight!  Here's latest case/death charts North South Dakota, running 7-day steep curves. 

South Dakota currently 32.43 deaths per 100k. North Dakota much higher, 44.61 deaths per 100k.

Here's overall state rankings, per capita Naw sense humor isn‚Äôt dry, it‚Äôs cheesy. taken lightly....this virus serious, think serious many want admit. thing seems mutate fast. fuck None actually desribe America. run planet, we‚Äôre largest economy military earth largest influence planet. Despite reddit hate US fact we‚Äôre none things NZ is. know already.... ... both... Mongols know earlier cheese may well stumbled onto ... Err ridden unique Mongoloid cheese accidentally. People already don‚Äôt understand mask keeps getting sick. abstract metaphor like gonna get anyone isn‚Äôt already safe?  dont understand connection videos ""carmagedon"" analogy covid deaths? probably right movement large, conversations family tried right thing, felt bit whiplash changing guidance. matter though, already started seeing cloth masks sent way late Feb-early March. still living great-grandmothers make little paranoid.

Don't get started shit-show lib-twitter, though. Lots smug voices chastising early mask adopters even going far public people ""robbing"" healthcare workers PPE. place bets number blue checks I've seen publicly acknowledge part debacle... big number. Depends is. washing hands surfaces pretty much useless compared wearing mask? really like Home Alone thumbnail dont I'm trying fight, I've listed whole bunch reasons theory work practice provided zero counter points them. going argue something, properly bother taking Australia, media brought up.

ive trying tell people start take thing lightly Happy Cake day Cheese Historian Stranger! Corona really serious disease. nit deadly flu. know someone's going point proof physical distance, ventilation, masks work all, hand hygiene enough itself. Good thing we‚Äôve 6 months ramp production ensure plenty PPE ongoing pandemic. Right guys? Right? Guys? Live Idaho. governor sucks. People around world think Americans morons. 100% correct course, pretty good approximation. first year parents retired, they're it. They're high risk, they've resumed traveling, visiting family, going weddings, parties, funerals, etc. locked while, mom's cousin uncle died separate incidents last month, they've MUCH active. think gotten heads one ever promised tomorrow could careful anyone else still die anything. 

And honestly, know argue that. saved decades decent retirement, soon reached it, world shut down. first, attitude ""we long enjoy retirement"" seeing someone age pass away suddenly freak accident, switch flipped realized that's necessarily true. mean, possibility bad case COVID much higher possibility dying accident, that's hard explain.

I'm rambling, point shit drags longer longer takes lives, people going rationalize returning behaviors want return to. I'm saying good thing all, absolutely *will* happen. much true. Let see find source indicating one way other:

This pretty definitive, read fully yet probably Pierre months. told several friends I‚Äôm living fear. I‚Äôm happy, healthy, avoiding indoor gatherings, wearing mask. Seriously, it‚Äôs hard. person replied already answered relevant links. thanks anyway.

I mostly interested trends see cases stable, increasing decreasing. Unfortunately hard say inaccurate numbers get Spain. sad visualized like something third graders text book people understand this. show proof covid-19 causes strokes two years? irresponsible piece gutter trash. idc happens  better defenses taserface. fact inherently obvious testament poor education.  already thing extremely helpful people. wanna get caught breaking rules üòâ Anyone know mortality rate now? seen anything recently. want create policy reddit, going scenarios?

Please stop trying fight try reasonable person. cases / likely 15 times officially recorded, possibly.

That ""likely"", especially testing became common, number come way down. 

But holy hell, think every single person NYC may already teh virus? kidding? Lockdowns harm good. lot countries rely tourism economy, many familes already living poverty can‚Äôt afford feed kids, literally. Look Bali, tourists, money. contact tracing wear masks social distance mush possible. Californians don‚Äôt anything rains. favorite nights gym rainy ones, would place myself. virus fully understand.  maybe publish data. 

Again, I'm denying there's possibility exists. real evidence available apart anecdotes. even exists whatever extent, needs mechanistic explanation. Yeah we're talking deaths people dont get tested dont die matter not? I'm saying RCTs scientific gold standard determining something effective, every single RCT found masks effective stopping transmission influenza-like viruses.

Are going provide peer-reviewed RCT showing effective, going continue talk bro-science? mobility. Social distancing best weapon thing. Mobility still 20-40% places depending type travel. want see happens community distance takes precautions, look Hasidic community NYC. went fall 40+% seropositivity theyre churning test positivity rates teens. They're going 60+% seropositivity ends. dispositive point. Completely impossible ""we're almost herd immunity"" fantasies. Well reading article, saying died ‚Äúfrom COVID-19‚Äù little bit misleading, it‚Äôs accurate quote article say deaths indirectly caused pandemic, necessarily Covid. mean main argument deaths (or deaths, hard tell) could avoided pandemic handled properly still valid either case, I‚Äôd rather give people satisfaction thinking ‚Äúgotcha‚Äù saying deaths weren‚Äôt directly caused COVID-19 actual test plans then? contact details responsible person fee inclined contact get confirm:

Go search Reddit voted articles dated. bet didn‚Äôt give fuck abt issue four years ago sudden turned HR crusader conveniently time Trump administration needed portray China next enemy distraction purposes. clue. Could give fuck less whole Left vs Right thing. suck. can't possibly see side think like that. 

It's show. debates. red vs blue. Anything everything keep us divided.  already know DeSantis mass murderer. East Asian culture like 90% Chinese culture 10% Chinese culture adapted local/Indigenous course US part it. country fucked up... misreading Hopkins saying. saying stays body result shingles rarely full blown chickenpox symptoms, full body rash. saying reinfection. saying symptoms full blown chickenpox. like comment foul mouthed aggressive apparently set bot. widely known ongoing decades would seem Americans accept it? understand humans can‚Äôt quarantine year+. Trust me, get that. hate everything pandemic....but...the alternative ‚Äúlock down‚Äù certain governors seem think is, lock meant permanent.

Lock downs avoided government puts effect health conscious policies. See Korea example. Still...

There rules pandemic put health people one highest priorities. It‚Äôs complicated concept given fact economic impact health conscious governance gives (or better) economic results outright ignoring health people. economy less dead people. 

I think everyone needs understand too... Huh? one benched. extremely common happen dealing large trials, 'bench' usually lasts briefly. regulatory pause trials anyone hospitalized. too. too. literally says ""May have"" fear mongering Muppet. believe done well yourself. matter. ratio case-to-hospitalitisation-to-death constant age group (not across age groups)

So 1,000 cases 30year olds, get 1000/x hospitalizations 1000/y deaths.

10,000 cases per day (after 7-14 days) = 10,000/x hospitalisations 10,000/y deaths. end *shallower* trend 60 years olds. relationship still hold. 

It doesn't. Roo 3 times. It‚Äôs amazing festival great people. teenager came in, horrified, show footage may expressed interest someone were, say, near unmasked many senior repubs wont do, may possibly otherwise occupied 1-3 weeks time senate vote going on. 

There silver lining every psychopathic disease spreader. early days, think know enough yet make determination. ~~that's put iirc can't find source~~ always sunny Philadelphia reference No. Unlike many viruses corona virus mutates slowly, 1000 times slower HIV rhinovirus. Even SARS1 antibodies neutralize covid, distant cousins.  reinfection possible, happening. 

We know common is. fines stop people speeding, smoking areas shouldn‚Äôt, drinking public, littering, things never happen due fines.

Stop? No. Reduce behavior? Yes. saying cough mask, larger droplets virus inside get stopped? surprise despite cultists screaming ""PADDED NUMBERS"". 

I would even less surprised people / covid reported. many desperate gyms / restaurants / __ fill blank ___ open / stay open unless go doctor hospital refuse get tested. believe another reason numbers continue climb. complete utter madness cause current administration enablers. would expect undercount primarily due asymptomatic victims tested first time. governor actively pushing everything open full steam. get impression pragmatist. problem cases, actually worse first time reinfected people (and yes, opposite others). I'm broke buy reddit shinies upvote beautiful person you. nice see 400yr mask history *not* one typing it.

My first comment flipped bot wtf?!? I'd getting boosters every year, then. politics. Donald Trump said tomorrow, masks work, wear one, vote me, they'd cheer mask up. you‚Äôve read article, researchers determined lockdown caused additional deaths. Woolf says deaths indirectly caused pandemic camefrom illnesses Alzheimer's disease, diabetes heart disease, sharply increased five states recorded COVID-19 deaths. care, fear seeking care emotional crises stemming pandemic could also contributed deaths... Imagine collusion taking place Dems hospitals pull suck story........ /s Ah yes. Glad see Plague Inc still time. twice.  get impression want proven right.  *psychopaths ever driven highway? People going speed limit exception, rule.  hundred outliers among millions cases 

We know that. 

The ones PROVE ones genetically sequenced, twice, different strain time (to prove remnants first infection). 

The amount people applies ""millions""; Rather, small amount people. Name calling. bet think win. Anyone else 4 guards guard pope covid? Like use godly connection buddy Yeah, wearing masks least 80% I've seen. Literally reason #s dropped quickly. Hospitals hit 93% capacity everyone masked up.  one really know IFR given anywhere close knowing precisely many cases really are. Basing policy estimates would really bad idea right now. Yes holy shit. Humanity far, FAR worse pandemics next medical knowledge. I‚Äôm pretty sure we‚Äôll able end one access advanced technology world ever seen. Better even odds he‚Äôs also getting tested. believe it‚Äôs two negative tests 24 hours apart? There's break laws, vast majority don't. break laws mean get rid laws.  agree. lot people previously pretty careful seem taking 'fuck it' approach. see face masks around peoples' necks supermarket, restaurant parking lots full, etc. I

I live Allen County, generally oversupply hospital beds. But, since huge swathe northern Indiana transfers acute cases Fort Wayne's Lutheran Hospital Group Parkview's hospitals, seems conceivable could see capacity issues Fall turns Winter. going pretty. flipped script ""that's need universal health care hospitals can't fake reimbursement"". Yup, lupus spring afraid going hospital deal health issues. Luckily I'm okay, mental health time wasn't. live Vermont people seem functioning sanely, honest terrifying anymore me, would living anywhere else US. also access level life healthcare many states mean, yeah. course every bed full moment. 

But reach near capacity several states earlier summer. 

Also happened Italy. 

I‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs currently issue. I‚Äôm saying covid surge fills ICU capacity sidelines significant number medical staff lead secondary deaths non-related problems turn technically also attributed covid. I‚Äôm sorry loss. grandpa passed away past Friday taking fall six weeks ago spending time hospital rehab it. stay, also caught COVID. Eventually tested negative moved hospital rehab facility begin physical therapy developed massive internal bleed basically wasted away 48 hour span. made decision take vent Friday afternoon went less 5 minutes later. honestly dunno official cause death went as, mind, Covid killed him. rebounding well, caught sapped everything. weakened afterwards. Hey now, love Joe. reading though, everything says take grain salt. like personality, swear everything says. Can't assume lot re-infected getting tested they're displaying symptoms? Tegnell gambled immunity period half year. data shows lost bet. Otherwise Sweden would show way lower numbers Italy: many deaths spring seem help slow second wave.

In case, even would bet, immoral gamble lives people. go all-in poker table stake lives wife children, got nuts (best possible hand). Nah really though. 100% accurate, find something else complain about. bring RemindMe bot one. vaccines give immunity last longer. STILL might need booster shots, though. Healthy young people get covid die organ damage too. likely contagious 

We got tests. remove 'very likely' got tests. 

And 'isn't considered contagious' 'not contagious'. tests see someone's viral load. clear chicken pox. buries nerves lives forever. life. like HIV, never fully get rid it. 

This happens something like Covid. Right I‚Äôm sure Sputnik Vaccine based soundly foundations science medicine. positive tests know chest pain might even occur women experiencing heart ... chest pain always severe even noticeable symptom, particularly women. Women often describe pressure tightness. And, possible heart attack without chest journalists know use word ‚Äúgrim‚Äù headlines? taught journalism school? Literally every. Fucking. Headline.

As u/atealein told you, local lockdowns (as apartment building, work place, nursing home, etc.) currently possible nothing bigger that. Unfortunately man discussed article worse second infection compared first. evidence points milder subsequent infections necessarily case. correct, wrong reasons. 

It's normal testing. people getting genetically sequenced. 

the 23 proven cases proven person virus genetically sequenced time different strain, proving residual first infection. 

The amount people sequenced multiple times, months apart likely pretty small, even even count reinfected teh strain. user name checks used cheddar need 7 slices Swiss. refuse live Covid.

We need shut every country 2 months virus die out. Apparently barely understand works anything does! many, again, Presidents helicoptered hospital given experimental drugs treatments got flu?

Oh, wait... Finally, chart even dumbest Wisconsinites understand. We‚Äôre running research monkeys US testing we‚Äôve run many COVID vaccine tests. absolutely animal testing.

Here‚Äôs good rundown non-human primate tests far: wonder hope hicks going swap spit goes Netherlands.

Are big /medium size countries well besides China?

Europe bad America Canada bad surge too.

Africa well paper real situation? Lord, humans going susceptible viruses bacteria even funny. 20 percent need hospital admission half need icu hospitals empty busy cancer patients surgical patients accident patients etc 

So hospitals run 80 percent full case rate running 10x available free hospital beds week two overflowing unless cancel elective surgery discharge possible patients nursing homes may carry corona virus  personal appearance door Rabbi stature carries immense gravitas.

What good man. 

I hope sacrifice makes difference. something seems misunderstood America. tendency go way find single ""fix-all"" solution accept nothing less, reality, layered solutions almost always effective.

It's basically telling world, ""Listen, I'm willing **one** thing help contain global catastrophe, that's it"" still think analogy simple enough Americans understand. I'm sick people still playing cocky it. Thats it?

Please read limitations:

Main limitations:

`¬∑` **Number animals used small (6 ChAd-Ox1 nCov-19, 3 control vaccine)**

`¬∑ Low IFNg response antigen-restimulated PBMCs 1/6 stronger responders`

`¬∑ Viral neutralisation titers low vaccinated animals day challenge 28 days post inoculation (between 1:20-1:40, median &lt;1/20)`

`¬∑` **Macaques susceptible severe disease**

`¬∑ Macaques protected developing pneumonia retained viral genomic RNA upper respiratory tract. Therefore, vaccinated` **subjects might still transmit virus.** `However, monkeys challenged high viral titer (2.6 x 106 TCID50).`

All know usual testing animals (for safety efficacy) done companies quickly jumped humand trials.

 I'll disregard article, another vaccine chinese company. complications side effects China, hear it. Awesome! counterpoint Spanish flu people anywhere mobile, spread countries (even domestically) less likely occur refered ""defense depth"" within cyber security community. Okay, got phone dad, he's saying crap Good Morning America said something UK/England passed U.S. infections. honestly really understand it, sometimes listen give facts context might missed. find anything Google search, figured I'd ask here. Anyone know part GMA morning might referencing? Thanks help. death others boring you? Yikes. use main account spew ignorance? Afraid opinions wrong? interesting application nuclear process safety often design parallel equipment model. P-123A P-123B model they're likely fail time, important Chernobyl-level events risk matrix. like name, Graham. Thank you. ok physical distancing, ventilation masks work? got it. 

/s heard Thailand also well. Masks + distancing reduces need less pleasant restrictions full shutdowns prevent collapse local state interstate medical system... 

Not mention pure suffering many infected people go even kill leave needing organ transplant. local collage kids described felling like elephant chest two weeks last spring happy mask saw Dr news say lungs felt like hot lead. Another Dr said bones felt like fire.


Even around 5% chance killing would wearing mask feel things worse get survive give someone goes minimum reduce risk. Singapore open NZ well Vietnam, Brunei Darussalam AU. return leg get quarantined. travel could set strict bar cases countries within bubble. able cope well virus. Potentially guaranteed governmental support NZ / AU worse happened.

Thailand low cases also low testing rates, possibly could risky. much cheese much cheese? Following advice medical professionals probably gouda idea!! 12 points

No source

Nice Ok that‚Äôs cool literally said national television yesterday, ‚ÄúI tested Friday.‚Äù makes fucking sense. virus you‚Äôre breathing mouth? risk anything else?

The Netherlands tried use excuse while, mask mandate would lead people distancing staying home (which based zero evidence), require masks seeing surge cases.

When learn mistakes countries?  would something relating laws, economy, human behavior, education, healthcare ever ""non-political debate""? think mistake rather people tend think use non-scientific arguments politics. Koreans control US troops Korea. believe Americans say military personnel quarantined tested negative. Since many Korean people working close proximity American military personnel Korea, wonder many cases covid Korea really come United States. admitted blood oxygen 63. way. damn arizona great job Always case europe well tbh... used carry fairly benign undertones. Since orange baboon‚Äôs election, anything benign disappeared Lock now. Dont even risk 3rd wave. Lock down! Link government estimate? almost everyone dies flu

? Although figures figures back comparable Finally someone calls ""physical distance"" opposed ""social distance"". can't believe dubbed ""social distance"". Jersey fucking shit show. many morons acting like covid big deal Noooobody sub gives af. dead case statistic covid, way push political agenda, hunger poverty concern showed symptoms taken hospital, afraid dying (like one NYC developer friends back April), he's basically full ""it's big deal"" mode, violating every public health precaution gusto.

His followers buy that, realizing right there's enough MAB treatments *1 day's worth new cases*. They're getting MABs maybe December/January. meantime, lots people going get severe disease.

Arguably, Tweet got hospital, saying big deal, lethal Tweet history. People mostly respect them. public transportation especially everyone wearing mask. Sometimes you‚Äôll see someone mask nose personally see less summer. 

As curfew, bet neighborhoods won‚Äôt follow police show up, wander around leave people right back streets 5 min later. That‚Äôs happened lot 2 months lockdown. 

But majority city follow it. work museum took while, people (workers visitors) seem used mask, social distancing... 

However people smart enough know #1 issue schools. Millions maskless children running around together day hugging parents, siblings grand parents school. curfew, closing bars gyms etc help us schools operate way. people frustrated don‚Äôt want obey stuff. Numbers worldometer low, too. RKI always latest data. 6,500 cases rki reported, wtf? hoped vaccine cause much stronger antibody memory, viral strains, natural infection does. terrible headline. looks basing US highest number deaths, trying suggest means highest death rate. sucks, got hit hard beginning. Hope squash new wave. live die Facebook underdeveloped brains. loose sense smell? seems # 1 indicator is/was covid. Indian Council Medical Research said every reported case India, 80 gone unreported. per them, anywhere 200-500 million probably already exposed virus. I'm actually person replied no, I'm fan rapists thanks asking. US, crimes covered thoroughly NFL owner (edit: ~~grumpy NFL coach~~) getting handy. diagram convinced one thing, nothing else: buy eat cheese without holes, like cheddar. germany costed 20 million euros. quarantine. lack imagination mean something impossible. chariot awaits, GOVEnah I'm wondering thing! pretty big news understanding again... masks work. many studies prove this. (If claim shit without sources, too). France people wear give shit. 

The issue mask, knuckleheads refusing use them. This, much this! one FAR.  probably use FDA emergency use platform. limited way They're currently piloting events 250 , see safe management processes workable.

Testing happens instead opening doors hoping best???! Who'd thought! Orthodox Jewish people use *light switches* Sabbath. let's pretend they're using TikTok (or even email) six days week.

Orthodox Jews split two big camps- Modern Orthodox Ultra Orthodox. find interesting many comments Reddit group together different average outsider. 

Modern Orthodox people keep Sabbath, eat Kosher, attend private Jewish day schools, etc. largely regular jobs relatively engaged world. Modern Orthodox schools generally follow NY State Curriculum sit state wide (Regents) final exams high school. Tons Modern Orthodox students attend CUNY schools (the public university system NYC) Yeshiva University (a religious Jewish university relatively mainstream, like went Fordham 50s). 

Ultra Orthodox people everything Modern Orthodox people much extreme. relatively isolated cultural group. centered New York, generally socialize people Ultra Orthodox. work business run members sect. scandals Ultra Orthodox schools providing sufficient education English math. Ultra Orthodox people born raised New York entirely fluent English (Yiddish lingua franca).

One reasons Ultra Orthodox lockdown New York lot families lack home internet sufficient number devices engage distance education. kids might dad works B&amp;H, selling high end cameras fulfilling internet orders. change fact family really online. may baseline there. hardcore lockdown mean? truly hope receive support need. lovely day friend. S'pore country restores faith humanity.

It started shithole led dictator, said dictator actually put country first, turned _this_. basically Mary Sue country point. economic consequences going lot worse don‚Äôt get control. Remindme! 6 days  dont go cheese ? day ago NZ act differently.

It acted much earlier relative case arrival. NZ five weeks behind US first case arrival.

While US Europe allowed fester, NZ attacked quickly. 

Timing matters. That's carry blow torch. Incinerate anything family member inside 6 feet radius. 50M course pandemic, took 2 years.

We've lucky (so far) also seen anything bad last 102 years. Perhaps people start worrying next bigger milestone Black Death (which table serious doctors). would've easily circumvented declared state emergency first wave. flooded ICUs back would've justified, too. Also, head virologist kept insisting facemasks would give false sense security based gut feeling. Total shit show country. 

Oh well, positive note: least I'm fighting husband anymore. Every little thing predicted came true worse, he's learned keep mouth shut now. Hey, UK here. give good challenge! North Rhine Westphalia even population density next Netherlands. seriously trying argue anybody looks die pandemic bad person thousands people directly indirectly find employment due actions? United States fractured, election matter result, LEO politicians contribute it. separatists, militias, conservative racists exist long Trump emboldened them. Whether like US gone, we'll see comes fractures violence coming years. Well fact buy everything need, still think way overrated pandemic, it‚Äôs year lot people know caught virus death aware one person like 83 already, economical consequences going way worse Yeah think also hard sean fill way normally do. Go grocery store, buy it, bring home, put fridge.

okay everyone grocery store, workers supply chain (farms, processing, factories, delivery infrastructure) grocery store workers? That's quarantine 17

1088 Ladies first. I'm waiting contradict public health hospital data shows every covid metric former hot spots states collapsed despite alarmist rhetoric proved dead wrong.  

That point making, no? 

Or going obfuscate try cling onto minor point ignoring big picture? I'll wait. New York closed 4-5 months. even Wuhan shut long. acting like something different dozens states/countries. 

They didn't. timing same. NZ know less impacted places closed borders. difference circumstances, countries control (amount travel prior known community spread seeding infections). germany 88 million freak 4,800 cases already. think beat 7k week easily. already 50 hotspot cities. gotta spin, least spin class OUTDOORS. around that, although pain lug equipment daily set little parking lot fence. Ahhh,,everyone forgets forgotten.  really see hours practice per show metric use judge whether season could suddenly up.

Yeah months planning arrangements, orchestra might need 2 rehearsals one concert. available staff ushers, audio engineers, stage hands, lights crew, etc. make venue run? library time order parts Germany, organize, distribute them? winds principals time mark articulations breath marks parts, strings principals time marking bowings? percussionists given enough warning know would need find hire extras, extras arranged prepared? even worry instrument rentals transportation? conductor time study prepare score?

A shit ton planning effort goes fact comes together two rehearsals. vaccine? people taking it? Reason higher infections? one month away shutting 75% regular healthcare system current rate infection. kills lot people too. Added dying covid cannot treated space. saw happened Italy, serious triage done many dying turned away.

The economy also go take action sheer amount people die directly indirectly covid. people consume usual fears becoming infected. people see Facebook flaunting social distance mask use ones said ""cant"" follow politics. People willfully ignorant inconvenience. okay, they'll send everyone DFW cause Texas spike they're it.

Oh wait, we're already seeing one. last three steps don‚Äôt seem matter. Fine, won‚Äôt get tested, participate contact tracing clean.

#/s Ah go. American thinks rest world exist country full fat diabetic people good representation IFR. Dr Fauci also advised masks one point. saying. does, needs share.  Peloton whatever called for? smaller countries highest daily cases except france spain? would equivalent around 30 40k daily cases germany uncreative pathetic excuses. people might rude. places cited still heavy restrictions things like bars, restaurants, crowd sizes, etc.

Yes, that's living COVID actually means that's article advocating; one good sense thinks need let COVID rip populace would effect things people COVID. poorly planned lockdowns, nothing works vacuum. Even so, living without lockdowns mean living mass outbreaks. COVID actually tearing America way NY, one would frat parties anyway. people even remember first COVID case Washington, first outbreaks although generally restricted nursing homes.

There one cost free option going make everyone happy. probably people NZ disappointed can't leave lot people...‚Äúliving it‚Äù means giving accepting mass outbreaks.

But necessary. Sweden announced restrictions place least another year, think Swedes enjoy life another year without going festivals mass weddings you. Swedes deal it, mean like necessarily, rest us too. frankly I‚Äôm sick irresponsibility. I‚Äôm sick governor going TV telling people go eat don‚Äôt restricting indoor dining despite us worst day pandemic day.

No one wants help small businesses common individual get this, America. can't even get 2nd stimulus passed people wonder get nationwide lockdown. Ask Argentina mass poverty homelessness worked lockdowns. I'm saying restaurants need open indoor dining, financial resources keep people afloat place successful lockdown. I‚Äôm Paris, France. Yes, people follow it. Obviously 100% since talking humans, shouldn‚Äôt controversional outside hundred people (out ten million) protest. Hasidic Jews Orthodox, Orthodox Jews aren‚Äôt Hasidic. And, course, Jews aren‚Äôt Orthodox.

I can‚Äôt speak non-Hasidic Orthodox communities dealing Covid, Conservative, Reform, Reconstructionist Jews generally following secular authorities Covid restrictions, adapting practices. Zoom services, outdoor services limited attendance, things like that. understand showing someone 100% safe could wrong, explain measures hurt? What‚Äôs hurtful things like increased/improved ventilation, surface cleaning, washing hands, wearing mask? took muh errd immunity I‚Äôm nyc. Born raised here. I‚Äôm poor typer. square previous research couldnt find active virus plastic tile surfaces 2 days? disagreement huge.  You‚Äôre anti-rational counts learn one way another COVID-19 is, probably hard way. I‚Äôm science major, yeah science brain tells brain rationally thinks every fact eludes would fail science field. don‚Äôt even know begin statement, I‚Äôm going pretend you‚Äôre sarcastic live rock. Last 9 months first term. SOB going steel next term. feels shade towards countries like Belgium Spain rather bad research. be, studied specifically common cold coronaviruses, 6 months indeed point see regular reinfections people.

See recent revisit  case. control positives selected pool. hearing reinfection common China back February March, too? Orchestras rainy day funds? serious? Oh god, can‚Äôt madness sub. You‚Äôre getting high horse sCiEnCe dumbed sketch Swiss cheese. that‚Äôs fall back feel challenged. want anyone engage reasonably you‚Äôre going wrong. Ok, look story past 5 months someone getting reinfected. see lots lots comments saying PCR tests might picking remnants original infection, never cleared first place. 

And comments wrong - can't rule without genetic sequencing two different strains. 

I agree regarding knowing relapses. sorts stories it, know anybody actually tracking it. find something definitive tracked, would grateful let know. mental health damage get working bad worth risk getting covid.

jesus christ. go outside exercise. Lived 8 people 3 bed/1 bath month two. convenient, definitely doable. Especially like people. China COVID control, people stupid?

New Zealand send regards - (rightfully) great thought ""getting blessing God"" now. headline claims worst death rate among developed countries. Spain Belgium developed countries worse death rates. truth bad enough. There's need lose credibility false/misleading headlines. Reinfections already widespread. Immunity lasts couple months. We‚Äôre zooming Thanksgiving year. even kids making paper floats put little parade across screen. Might sing Hamilton song make little authentic. Given bad system begin with, surprising. think higher-risk folks family members wrong concerned. want take extra precautions protect themselves, support that.

However, unfair higher-risk people treat everyone ELSE adversary open condescension. see much combative behavior pro-lockdown crowd anti-lockdown crowd, I'm honest. Canadian, understood election Trump. That's path would follow lived US understand driving factors leading election. troubles done approval rating consistently 40% (43.5% according 538) would likely reelected Covid. may still get reelected base going vote record numbers. Trump small cult followers, 140 million Americans happy job he's doing. lived US 4 years, thought pretty good idea share world's longest unprotected border realizing clue what-so-ever.  must using company Gov Abbott selected testing Texas; one experience testing prior contact award months late delivering test results. seriously comparing new Zealand China? Jeez..

In case managing Pandemic - Yes, yes am....

Who else pandemic mostly handled policies/infrastructure place head outbreaks happen?

And able cool stuff like much worry?  statements based scientific evidence available time.

They manipulation. intent came first, ""facts"" second.

If want something inclined do... go fact-finding mission come *something* motivate it... still manipulated even things say true.

How difficult understand? sound hyper sensitive looking argument. Go study comprehend information I‚Äôm telling you. Science friend. article really sentences long?

35. Hanging Sick Person Ideally it'll ""be around"" terms resurging issue every months, another 6 months so. we'll kicked gut vaccines.

But yes said, one form another (hopefully much less disruptive form), it'll around quite while. understand 'cure worse disease'. Even ignoring people get seriously ill, long term health consequences, reduced lung capacity, internal organ damage, etc,  46,000 deaths UK covid past 6 months so.   

How one reach conclusion uk lockdowns worse? 100,000 deaths lockdown? Doesn‚Äôt sound like it. bursts noise like Serena Venus Williams championship doubles match Andre Agassi &amp; Wayne Gretzky. 

LMAO, see we've several spin classes! üòÅ Lmao WHO, silly silly organization. never thought netherlands would high count Disagree order item, indoor parties dangerous theme parks. Infection rare outdoors close friends family likely get sick. South Korea never closed theme parks. reported hit 1 million 3 days last week. took 5 months 1 million 30 days. worldwide numbers. Argentina getting bad right now. I'm US starting climb again. Fashion! Ay Caramba! \*spanish oh no\* 0.6% chance could critical condition die I'm one needs face reality. issue spreading vulnerable people higher risk death dying. covid July tell need understand it. agree outdated info. list overemphasizes risk surface transmission doesn‚Äôt weight indoor/outdoor considerations heavily enough like many people good contract tracing data. 

Also going walk? considered risk? Har har har ""freedumbs"", genius play words, funny terrible example Swiss cheese model. takes one failure get coronavirus. proper Swiss cheese example takes multiple failures. people said plane crashing perfect example Trump already did. He's back rallies now. Yes, know much. Shortly secret police come take away already. slowly wipe record one knows ever existed. wisconsinite headline lie.

Spain Belgium higher death rates U.S. I'm fairly sure they're developed Look deaths per million population.

The U.S high death rate compared countries world, lie claim highest? Accurate No! say 70%! saw ""study"" said 70% people tested positive week tired! long term effect! week long time! /s talking about? science behind virus.[archive link New York Times article explaining science think viruses infect cells? It‚Äôs basic science. Ah see. You‚Äôre one believes able enter country want. New Zealand. shut borders allow non-new Zealander in. That‚Äôs xenophobic. 

Freedom confused entitlement. seems done. ""monkeys fuck people rear too"" model anymore? MCFPITR remember properly Add zero fine, hit again. Okay looks like wrong... CanSino, Sinopharm. agree healthcare industry made profit actually make people healthier would bad business current form. 

We nation Band-Aids actual sustainable, long term solutions would save money help people long term. silly useless list... good know hanging sick friend 10! good reports covid causes permanent infertility kills sperm cells? you‚Äôre sick you‚Äôre going get tested. Africa done west hasn‚Äôt given success? testing people. That‚Äôs point-to rank risk things people do. [Don't say warn even worse, infamous [Casu Rabbid do-gooder community. never going two weeks.

Now America isn‚Äôt country lockdown. Occam away inconvenient fact US, outbreak control, massive YoY death discrepancy? countries locked aggressively, incur less stress related deaths? Doesn‚Äôt make sense. Misrepresentations facts taken context tenet disinformation campaigns. Every country seen increase cases I‚Äôm even going acknowledge China unless brainwashed know fact lying. B-but muh free speech! Muh liberties! Large sectors economy actually depend mass gatherings office workers. hospitality sector collapses rest economy suffers it. Yes, sustain it, propping fallout already cost us ¬£300 billion, many times 2008 financial crash annual budget NHS. I‚Äôm asking much much? ¬£500 billion? ¬£1 trillion? sums money define fiscal capacity government generation, long average life expectancy COVID victim. 

It hilariously tragic suggest universal basic income possibility happening obliterated economic crash deficit caused lockdowns restrictions. UBI relies strong economy government finances. Exactly. need able take dump street, freedum! coronavirus come bad smell, isolating close contact wearing mask pandemic effects. üòÇ LOL.. This. 

Sorta like picture hurricane üåÄ viral particles room coming top spinner clue (he's?) infected really getting it, including gutteral bursts noise like Serena Venus Williams championship doubles match Andre Agassi &amp; Wayne Gretzky. science say ""no side effects"" ""really minor side effects"".

If tubby ass goes mile time 7:30 7:40 I'm breathing slightly harder, I'm going attribute basically couch potato who's shape. minor testing might even catch it, probably even bother getting tested.

If Cristiano, professional athlete, goes 5:00 5:10 breathing slightly harder, that's completely different ball game. post hoc ergo proper hoc fallacy. people high infection areas wear masks infection rate high, make higher proportion ill. amount times CNN straight thrown misleading headline directly contradicted article - usually content-rich paragraph invariably buried end ads - beyond belief. CDC Director said could 95% mask compliance two four weeks. said would take thing four eight weeks. 

So... guess there‚Äôs nothing get control. STOP SAY! COVID PANIC RULES ALL! ONE ALLOWED ENJOY ANYTHING! WAIT 2097! besides literally sitting next sick people long time, going church next dangerous thing..... hahaha

btw, info bit old (somewhat outdated), even article not. real issue internet require license operate average Americans can't handle privilege responsibly. EXTRA 250 000 people died compared last year died hypertension diabetes? aren‚Äôt stressing then? I‚Äôd panic sudden many died diseases. seems unlikely vaccine ever 60-70% effective wont know get there. different person president suddenly stop people idiots. subscribe cheese facts? testing &amp; understanding= cases report.

What matters ICU/death rates, declined, doesn‚Äôt sound like juicy headline society collapsing. sad needs made, think average adult would smarter 5 year old.. true. It‚Äôs said CDC cases either asymptomatic mild. Y‚Äôall like plug ears focus one obese middle aged man died.. use terms NPC that's literally act.

I'm right-leaning. happen capable wearing mask without imploding downtrodden parrot whatever people power say

You literally admitted use video game term that's used hundreds thousands asshats instead using brain say anything original. irony thick political. ruining tens millions lives lockdowns

I agree. political.

We set first lockdown parts planet, came it. least months. United States specifically, people started screaming fascism muh precious liberties, breathe mask on.

Splintered, shattered approach handling virus has, unsurprisingly, led *not* able reopen properly.

We never fixed issue first place idiots locking properly first people fucking sick head - seriously.

You're stupidest person spoken today. Reddit. Going ignore southeast asia see.

Also, young doesn‚Äôt prevent infections, yet number cases Africa still low. mask requirements? u r xenophobic ? Around 18% Indiana today. come ""oh scary"" comments one fit people world even know virus tested Feat mongering. Stop twisting data evoke fear. Infection control never question. It‚Äôs done repeatedly great success. Different populations. Almost every country Africa median age 18. going get sick. mean give want, plenty work space 4 feet wide 6 7 feet No. We‚Äôre not. currently restrictions. beat virus. Twice. thing shut border. one moments, expense much, is. type open ended medical billings need controlled. true though. Yeah cherry picked. also talks people going restaurants eating masks etc. Masks also much protect getting it, they're stop spreading germs everyone's danm minds can't seem grasp basic concepts. shared video show my.point masks keeping germs you.

 study entirety  gets million dollar hospital bill prize. Airborne. Prolonged exposure droplet distancing precautions nothing. It‚Äôs almost 85% Covid cases asymptomatic something majority would go undetected anyways.. crazy.. **Affiliation:** Ohio University, Department Communication Studies

U wot m8? Absolutely, yes. read places basically anything people do... places Yeah it‚Äôs concept I‚Äôve heard don‚Äôt know ton about. think since immunology field pretty new, it‚Äôs still figured out. (again speculating) could feel tired, sluggish, low-appetite you‚Äôre sick body‚Äôs energy focused making B cells cells rather locomotion digestion. always large population activated, clonally-expanded white blood cells, would possibly always feel like that.

I remember reading guy Stanford looking ME/CFS, generally post-viral disease. supposedly found high degree clonal expansion among cells CFS patients, don‚Äôt know he‚Äôs confirmed published observation. is.

I see reason supporting different ""stage"" infection control.

Now ""infection control"" kinda question, economic damage comes play prominently. wasn‚Äôt disagreeing you, best like long time. worst: forever.

I‚Äôm making promises making side $15,000 per person. First step recovery admitting. great. Keep going. general health safety training principle situations nowadays. kind city planning would drive anyone batty. Go get prove wrong bet love freedumbs China using traditional well-proven vaccine model using inactivated covid particles. However, inactivated vaccines achille's heel may trigger antibody-dependent-enhancement, virus adapts &amp; mutates, circumventing antibody protections, resulting even larger viral load multiplying unchecked. ego really fucking wish someone would press Trump one blowbags point. holds absolutely water whatsoever.

* Saying response bad inherently relative statement. say that, really saying response worse countries. ""2 million"" bullshit address all, basically ""statistical straw man"" prop slap around even running first-world country planet, instead contend imaginary number talk hard beat one. 

* I'm certain one, believe 2 million figure literally SINGLE predictive model like really, really early (like first month) tried figure number deaths nobody absolutely anything. national response, local response, modification behavior individual level. First all, that's even realistic, obviously people would personally change behaviors thousands dying every day. There's real world scenario happen. Second all, think pretty safe say model debunked (as majority models early crisis, know much point). country earth anywhere even remotely close close close catastrophic level death, even areas really weak responses. 

* China ban time? think pick legitimately good decision Trump made. Banning travel China right thing time widely agreed on, put foot it. Credit due, good move him. know make HUGE difference, particularly strict despite respectably quick movement it, still late. obviously save 1.8 million fucking people, that's ridiculous. 

* goalpost moving fucking palpable this. video, video cold hard inescapable numbers. like stuff shoot angles pretend meant something else you. simple numbers, horse's mouth. First Trump said would milder swine flu, killed 12k. started saying looks like could 60k 100k deaths. started saying kills 100k 200k, he's done ""very good job"". became obvious going blow past 200k long ends, said fuck switched imaginary nonsense 2 million figure. video makes physically impossible take argument seriously. Yet intentionally expose someone HIV considered attempted murder. place apparently owned ER doctor. hometown. People PISSED! You‚Äôre right, maybe I‚Äôm hallucinating. Maybe I‚Äôm abjectly insane. Maybe died 2019 whole year awful pre death DMT release. Maybe don‚Äôt live say do, maybe words I‚Äôm actually writing aren‚Äôt ones I‚Äôm reading scream, fuck knows! Great post every anti-science wank deserves ""reasonable discussion"".

If want waste time energy educating trolls guest. haven't. Cite something alarmist untrue I've written. Cheese certainly lactose. Source: lactose intolerant ass Yes. It‚Äôs late. People allowed, encouraged even, anti science anti mask position they‚Äôre going give now. People complain want. problem right don‚Äôt informed strategy. nothing PR top.  tweet means nothing doesn‚Äôt come scientific organization curable data. course masks mandates aren‚Äôt working every red pulled tough guy wants say don‚Äôt need half population taking seriously half not. don‚Äôt care Sweden care country.

Plus actually look instead relying fucking tweets you‚Äôd see similar situation America death rates fucking donkey. Jesus Christ. It‚Äôs terrifying allow people drive lethal speeds interstates without interval NATOPS checks, annual health exams, etc died chemotherapy treatment wish articles like put things positive light based current facts. I‚Äôve read many publications lately nothing doom, gloom despair. According post, -75,000. Yes make money it. Nothing came it. Ya mean WH took control number count? 

I find hard believe. make matters worse hardly test anyone. 
The hospitals completely full sending people states hear helicopter life flighting people 10 15 times day. cold corona virus infections happen children indicating long lasting immunity normal

Cold coronavirus immunity lasts less year. Really appreciate it. dont fart?

Oh, smelled even though six feet away? Yeah, thats covid works. butt covid, would die 3-4 weeks. Actual amazing see conspiracy movement develop infancy.

NZ good job protecting citizens even know first hand deadly virus is.

My best guess, people lot going lives need someone something blame... NZ shut borders earlier too. Yes no. Yes air coming in, air coming sick person. always take time particles dissipate. yo privacy threat. classic liveral bullshit im done around bit now, gaining steam. Ivermectin another example something positive studies recently picking much. following science ""Not people under-report socially undesirable beliefs, also over-report behaviors socially desirable. PEW explains, ‚Äúresearch shown respondents understate alcohol drug use, tax evasion racial bias; may also overstate church attendance, charitable contributions, likelihood vote election.‚Äù - Giving number 42 bad name. Correct, diagram shows half icu patients get intubated. isn't. surveillance virus outbreaks second none.

I know want believe true. NVM forgot one site. honestly though gotten taken point. Studies take time get peer reviewed. study states 89% Americans tested.

Do think number know 5%? studies come peer reviewed show gross underestimate cases. possible test even 70% infected people. fact, can't even get tested symptoms. case many places. means 2/3rds never got it. Social distancing, masks, etc slow prevent spread.

It also habit killing people faster spread. Yup. one super exciting. also pill form, easier take Exactly ü§£. Right on. Many people fall either affording right exposure education, even trusting government past actions. like idea throwing hundreds thousands dollars fines impoverished demographics already unable keep massive amounts regulations standards. thread ""Disney World lore"" though. thread questioning anybody going Disney World right now.

Edit: bunch typos Imagine orchestra sitting near horn player virus! post thing... Good job. Ain‚Äôt truth.

As hospital worker, I‚Äôve actually disappointed Infection Control department lately. definitely seem like they‚Äôre *‚Äùcoming tracks‚Äù*, speak. 

There‚Äôs 0 oversight obvious issues cleanliness.

I feel look certain things like ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe this, this, that, missed!‚Äù

Then, step back think, feel like dick I‚Äôm pointing holes operation *or* making work repair sometimes difficult issues.

Right I‚Äôm teetering email Infection Control department pointing several flaws think addressed. I‚Äôm naturally paranoid hypochondriac, mind definitely works overdrive things people. feel like complaining, I‚Äôm pretty much shitting inefficiencies ‚Äî place I‚Äôm convinced infection control people two things;

1. Looking clocks much anyone else get work. don‚Äôt actually care.

2. can‚Äôt justify responses cost money (even it‚Äôs safety purposes) cause strenuous increases expectations departments, EVS (environmental services department) ‚Äî housekeeping. 

I might AITA post something. knows. call bullshit. many people going admit ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt wear mask got COVID‚Äù....at point, person would get big duh looked like stupid. anti mask group getting made fun internet lot now. There's lot wishful thinkin comment, imo. 

BTW, Coronavirus 1,000 times less likely serious mutations (coronaviruses stable flu viruses due self-policing mechanism have). Belgium really, really high spike population April stayed almost flatever since. Death rate give kind misleading impressions small populations one bad outbreak cause enough deaths make rate look huge, necessarily mean overall situation control. Yep, that's me. least get corona traffic light ever european country, travellers know countries safe \*slow clap No, sharing fevers got us mess ate nothing day worst symptoms (too weak eat weird exercise lot), would say low appetite. I'm sure lost sense smell though. least get corona traffic light ever european country, travellers know countries safe \*slow clap it‚Äôs going away November internet told make point another way, US population 330 million 210,000+ Covid deaths, doesn‚Äôt even come 1 percent. We‚Äôre probably going need Spanish Flu levels death 35 percent voting populace takes serious. positive test rate COVID-19 increased 2.4% Connecticut Tuesday, Gov. Ned Lamont said, marking highest positivity since June 12.  unexpected, it‚Äôs unnerving little exhausting,‚Äù Lamont said uptick positivity. ‚ÄúWhile exhausted wish behind us, also know takes beat virus beat good.‚Äù  late June early September, state kept positivity rate mostly gold standard 1%. schools universities reopened weather began cool, rate ticked 1% ‚Äî stayed month, rarely falling threshold never spiking high 2%.  Tuesday, state reported daily positivity rate jumped 2.4% ‚Äî 320 COVID-19 cases identified total 13,398 tests.  state also reported increase 17 hospitalizations, total 172 people currently hospitalized COVID-19. Connecticut hasn‚Äôt seen many coronavirus patients hospitalized since June 19.

Slow steady growth weeks now... depressing. Mask wearing near 100% public. Many schools open, either hybrid full time. Businesses fairly busy traffic feels back normal. outbreaks universities scattered concentrations different communities. sense could explode without much powder- example, cold weather might enough. masks enough, going get ugly. Would okay? Yes, would enforce quarantine positive cases?

Incidentally, longer term keeping infection rate low mass testing cheaper pressurized healthcare system, better economy recovery, overall better health population.

That works disease running amok whole country though. ""Take apple day, keep doctor away"". PANDEMIC üéâüéäüëçüëç call fire department house catches fire? idea people reluctant admit china probably handling ok, like basically every eastern country Please, nearly worst thing college students done make ends meet.

Belgium specifically higher official death toll decided count deaths *suspected* covid-related, deaths diagnosed cases.

From Belgian officials say counting way country world currently doing: counting deaths hospitals care homes, including deaths care homes suspected, confirmed, Covid-19 cases.

Countries choosing lot different methodologies counting rates infection mortality, many motivated internal politics, perfect apples-to-apples comparison pretty much impossible point.

Researchers started looking excess death rates try tease accurate statistics.

Reuters, quoting Belgium's task force spokersperson, ‚ÄúBut compare Belgium example United Kingdom Spain see actually hit even worse,‚Äù said, adding reflected ‚Äòexcess‚Äô mortality rates. ridiculous. expect people buy stuff bars restaurants? know give income somebody, somebody's whim? bigger factor likely immune systems became adapted virus, expected coronavirus. point make coronavirus go away without infecting people (which nobody really thought happen) point defer exposure vaccinated least once. Even influenza mutated less lethal, virus stable, means mutations either direction less likely. human adaptive immune system memory likely end pandemic virus mutating (but we're never getting herd immunity). Jersey actually great mask mandates, Jersey shore included. actually enforcing mask mandates (as go people tell put masks leave) pier rides sticking capacity, unlike I've seen places, Manhattan included.

Also, NJ one first states long time one states (think 4) mandate masks public places people congregate. check actually mandated, even NY State merely guideline. There's high compliance even among NJ ""cult members"" day one Governor Murphy early barely ridiculous debate yet happen.

One last fist pump NJ - also remote schooling options MANDATED. means if, like kids district, bunch lunatic parents demanded sports start August see practices games distancing wearing masks have, pick full remote. ENRAGED people want cake eat enough following precautions - want able get face well without mask pick drop off.

For hybrid kids took one day email go principal parents wearing masks following drop protocols painstakingly laid emails youtube video teachers played kids showed everyone ahead time typical hybrid learning day would look like. problems certain people, redundancies place people distance wear masks worry much beaten spit cause it.

My guess Murphy, like many things throughout pandemic, foreseen struggle demanded remote option schools students. thank heavens everyday he's Governor. makes blood boil. believe Covid fake...why take ass back America rather staying New Zealand? TSA then? many people know individuals killed 9/11 saw parents months staying away. wore masks. Watching touch adjust crappy cotton masks (that probably wearing weeks) concerning. dad shave beard better protection hand sanitizer used visit. last thing wanted remind (again) proper PPE use. brought n95s wearing one myself.  mask used touched *least* week use hands thoroughly sanitized carefully removing it.

My point proper PPE procedures effectively use simple general public. There's lots things go wrong mask use cut amount transmission SARS-CoV-2. even true people would bit mindful mask selection, fit use/removal/re-use. I‚Äôm six feet away therefore viruses cannot touch ! 14 days illness onset, 71% case-patients 74% controlparticipants reported always using cloth face coverings mask types public. 

Wow, groups wore masks equally according self confirmed COVID-19 (case-patients) approximately twice likely control-participants reported dining restaurant 14 days becoming ill.


But covid twice likely eat out, eat mask? us getting started stuff. intimidating done zero work cars. LOL great, would fuck even more. Even without anxiety disorder, have.

I never heard eat STD check... case I'd know. China almost covid free border matter. Well, live place masks pretty much norm long way normalish...  I'm thinking pretty much fantasy.  Masks help. wear one everyplace go.  minimize trips etc.  

But eaten restaurant since march. gone shopping since march, buy essentials fast possible.  gone mall since march.  

We approach normalish either effective treatment, vaccine, give up. would like, register graduate class writing scientific journal articles. fully discuss aspects genre, audience expectations, peer review.

No, I've addressed point couple different ways ignored:

1. using 0.13% straw man, I've discredited number likely far low/significant outlier.

2. IFR going different geo geo, likely due demographics/pre-existing conditions/etc. cities going higher worldwide IFR, going lower.

3. we're going pick single cities extrapolate, recent Northwestern University study found 20% sample Chicago virus. Per USAFacts, latest # deaths Cook County IL 5,300, divided 20% Cook County population (5.15M) gives IFR around 0.5%. pretty squarely range originally stated. Source: clear angry discredit reputable sources like Economist, World Health Organization, Washington Post ""propoganda"", there's clearly path discussion pursue here.  Obviously know came from.... Reddit front page full propaganda. title slightly changed. People read article upvote blindly. I'd imagine alot bots upvoting things. 

It easy control people afraid. Thanks China answer question? true extent never known. poor pandemic response certainly butterfly effect. 

While die Covid, fully believe without pandemic fathers outcome could much different better. died Oct 2 ‚Äòperfect storm‚Äô bad things. diabetic pain heart attack non existent. uncle heart attack thought dizzy. grandmother heart attack known got regular checkup heart told must one needed stint.

They want see who's profiting chemo. certainly want looking berry juice profits. Yes, look link, USA.

Since removed...there group people follow someone else likes words fake news. easily guess it. Anything goes rhetoric must wrong. right. Better keep everyone locked end 2021. I'll patiently await instructions then. Crazy  I'm saying animal tests all, understand done simultaneously animals humans. current Oxford data highly questionable, side effects. healthy individuals, without diseases even high risk. happens train people jobs, rather getting real education. american education system job placement rates, nothing else matters.

If proven that's necessarily true, one last factors preventing employers offshoring roles disappears.

Hence offshore workers tend similar capabilities much cheaper, what's stopping employer? need disagree you. instances aware of.

They, along WH AF said mask help. 

They also removed proper ppe guidelines medical workers. N95 mask always standard medical services providers. removed second pandemic started put back site.

And latest peekaboo posting airborne another instance omission truth. *minute*! never happen. people wont that. ALMOST back march april. people got stupid said ""fuck this"" went stuff like HELL could Yeah I've always heard referred onion model, Swiss cheese model. thing, really.   Right there's clear difference saying ""unfortunate news expected"" ""They *claim* normal whole thing hold know why, they're saying what's wrong patient"" etc.

I'm talking messaging. agree still bad news matter slice it. US developed country? Well, maybe 2016 was, it‚Äôs now.

In western countries around 10% workforce hospitality. Fuck people right? network security call concept defense depth. Basically find magic solution - ever solves every single problem. Instead layer solutions reduce risk something adverse happen potential damage minimized due next defensive layer. Much like network security, selecting right defensive layers provide pretty good defense keeping business case economy running. Yes. even know ban IP. computer security called defense depth onion security... think we‚Äôre losing sight COVID actually like get unlucky develop bad symptoms, I‚Äôd rather kind boring months home get insane respiratory virus makes cough like lifelong smoker run breath like marathon runner 1-3 weeks virus die stop socially interacting stay home 2 months.

Fucking hell, get out. Yes Saudi Arabia responsible 9/11 could millions cases know people usually get genetically sequenced, reinfection strain even count.

Making non-political mean removing aspects politics, means removing aspects politics alter outcome. Politics needed regardless order execute whatever decisions made. saying published restrospective study compelling data completed randomized double blinded clinical trial posted results?

Stop virus. people realize cannot stop it. take care hope don‚Äôt get can‚Äôt anything next man doing. It‚Äôs time move lives stop trying impossible. great model collective effort probability Well, eight million confirmed cases COVID US alone. That's 2.7% total population. reinfection rate even tenth original infection rate, seen 20,000 *confirmed* cases reinfection. supports theory low initial viral load leads mild/asymptomatic cases masking leads low initial viral load.

It infuriating US people arguing open everything back also people arguing masking. live somewhere remote? (helo insurance) I'm also sick hearing ""if we'd cooperated 2 weeks back March would over."" There's lot misunderstanding situation even today.

We always going keep layers defense unless somehow added layer made ones less necessary (e.g. vaccine). OK, fair enough, see point. seems highly disingenuous people unreservedly celebrate Sweden's present (and perhaps momentary) new cases situation completely ignoring context overall per capita death rate (which continues rank bottom 10% world's pandemic responses). Goddamnit realize going morons wearing cheese slices masks thought just: whoever stuck inside around others likely get sick. Hence spread faster summer months southern states, faster winter northern states. Dutchman here. Things abysmal. beat daily record 11 times past two weeks. Tonight they'll announcing new measures:

* Restaurants, bars cafes closed two weeks
* alcohol sold 8pm
* amateur sports 18-year-olds up
* Inside, 30 people less without exceptions

Meanwhile:

* Facemasks mandatory schools, supermarkets, universities. public transport, lots passengers seem take seriously
* Priority-testing reserved healthcare workers teachers abused many, make appointment turn claiming 'they forgot statement employer'and still get tested
* One five infected people quarantine
* Hospitalizations deaths creeping upward

Many seem take things seriously should. I'm education even though students urged wear masks, problem arises. Lots people sense urgency, parents even disagreeing child wearing facemask. 

We're hurtling towards second lockdown, hardly anyone seems care.  one study mice different virus evidence supporting humans? literally make sense. he‚Äôs young incredibly healthy, think he‚Äôll pull Nah, people humorously *overly* cautious.

You‚Äôre wearing mask? Great, let‚Äôs part.

You‚Äôre spending 30 mins day scrubbing groceries disinfectant? *chuckles* need shut borders halt immigration.

We everything survive. think it‚Äôs lack mask issue. get that, right? Unlikely he‚Äôs healthy could long term impacts possibly. local transmission. We've less deaths total Sweden last three weeks. We've less cases total Sweden last four days.

Oh, personally spent total 5 weeks ""on lockdown"" entire time.

I'll take numbers day. something think obvious.  Pretty massive considering government would house provide food necessities tens millions people expense. strategy would fiscal conservative‚Äôs worst nightmare. Even stranger, may catching virus much anyone else. One study found almost 47% Tokyo residents developed antibodies course summer pretty incredible leaves questions lot people go schools, universities likely private parties people going nightclubs decided open offering table service. 

The nightclubs sure investigated probably coming nights respective municipality responsible agency instead looking larger picture. issue one two packed nightclub. issue younger people like party need take responsibility. Closing one nightclub solve need target actual group behaviour. Well class, maybe would know that!! /s Testing sucks too. exposed two people Wednesday ended testing positive Friday/Sat respectively. 

Called GGD basically said still can't get tested without symptoms (why? still struggling test capacity point, denying evidence asymptomatic people spread it?). waited around inside 5 days exposure went develop symptoms, recommendation. 

Do it? clue. Could spreading it, develop symptoms later? Possibly. fuck knows though can't get test unless lie. 

The government flimsy stance masks (not mention RIVM insistent months nothing), flimsy rules (bars close 22.00, whoopdie doo), flimsy testing (we've months prepare fuck apparently). disheartening country now, I've little complain about. That's want put myself. Right middle sealed room people breathing extremely heavy around me.

It's almost like someone could see coming. wonder someone every make mobile spin bike. know something could go outside. Hell, added back wheel might make really easy transport. repeating cycle you. Also good lesson society. think rely much physical distance alone, never really made hint attempt mass testing. Remember scientists economists calling massive effort provide masks Americans crank 20 million tests/day, even perfect?

What happened that? Realistically, we've got one good layer cheese shredded bits behind it. Maybe we've got another hand washing, I've better year, I'm certainly nowhere near good March. Masks spotty country. one upgrading ventilation systems. Etc... Typical journalists prone misinterpretation top incentivized manufacture sensational interpretation possible. Yeah, fair call one. Can‚Äôt argue agree. least tried protect elderly (unlike certain places...)  me. dies? That‚Äôs higher risk take drive car good point, hadn‚Äôt thought potential witnesses strictly. Common cause failure considered SIS analysis multiple instruments, final elements, etc. Different models, makes, functions like float vs capacitance level increase reliability. least industrial process experience. CDC reference massive strategy compared massive strategy we‚Äôre currently failing implement? massive strategy we‚Äôll need get endless lockdowns? least make masks mandatory. Please show precisely gives mortality rate. yet that. original claim. Id think generally cleaner aswell? going friends relatives visited country said people clean themselves.

Where im pretty common find nasty crumpled used tissue (or worse) shopping cart, wedged inbetween slats public seat.. train/bus seat. dead shared average 2.6 comorbidities Well that's point. basically dying point. infection would pose mortal danger quite frankly finish off. nah, covid boo fucking hoo... Can't judge cheese totally judge person. Lol think incidents rape easily proven?

Jesus christ I'm sick reddit's anti-feminist chauvinist hive mind Noted. ham, less cheese. Got it. key takeaways:

‚ÄúThis outbreak highlights several important issues,‚Äù report said. ‚ÄúFirst, children adolescents serve source COVID-19 outbreaks within families, even symptoms mild. Better understanding transmission children adolescents different settings needed refine public health guidance.‚Äù

Six additional family members stay home visit different occasions, maintaining physical distance relatives households. None individuals developed symptoms four tested negative virus, CDC found.

‚ÄúNone six family members maintained outdoor physical distance without face masks two visits family gathering developed symptoms; four tested SARS-CoV-2 negative test results,‚Äù according report. Lol believe China? see Texas / Florida / Arizona / Georgia June July? going pretend like happen? I‚Äôm saying shutting make disappear, makes spread faster deeper peoples mind. 

Also shutting don‚Äôt mean forbidding gathering etc... openly treating like idiots refusing address adults deserve need things actually explained them. Failure made believe nothing reliable, conspiracy theories believable mean? Hey it‚Äôs sad, he‚Äôs got inflatable girlfriend case Hot Cheetos. Agreed, every reliable estimate 1%. 0.6% seems agreed-upon number, maybe time like 0.4% - 0.5% hopefully. That's absolutely true lol.

The risk COVID 19 infections extremely low, matter fact, currently dealing another deadly disease, rare variant Dengue Fever. really believe deaths? Thats delusional. No, take it. People around would dying, people animals care would stay watch. Nah one filters space travel? Yeah see even see 24 hour cases consolitated backlogged cases: think rest world needs stop stereotyping, honestly. pandemic yeah, knew wrote it. deserves laughing-crying face. numbers JHU may right (because report cases weekends backlog later): sad, dystopian commentary current economic climate. US developing nation? guess one calls super power anymore. mean like one pitot tube blocked / frozen? Stable least 5 months. Fuck it, I'll take shot 2-3x year thing stamped out. since seems minimum, hopefully even frequent. Deaths normally lag cases several weeks, feeling winter Sweden hit peak 7 day moving average around 50 deaths per day. speculating. Cause parties community spread stopped, like us NZ.

Just... wow. they‚Äôre masks point. assured won‚Äôt level information provide. They‚Äôre retarded, cost thousands lives never forgotten really are. Pieces shit. IL country well know that. IL locking IN, MI, every dipshit state rek country decided 'Democrat Hoax' means lockdown naught. 

Stop comparing individual states countries. Wait minute, still dealing coronavirus? though televangelist Kenneth Copeland dispelled coronavirus US back April using Blessed Wind already normal students ""donate"" blood cash books, cost $500+ each, covered already steep tuition costs. already normal colleges pay advertising encourage students donate blood and/or apply food stamps survive. also normal colleges accept students dorms for, refuse build dorms, years-long waiting lists privilege paying rent college, rather skyrocketing rent landlords town.

So student preexisting conditions hear COVID antibodies means blood ""donations"" valuable, right financial decision. fall empires happens right financial decisions made lots people short-term self-interest mind.

That said, consider source. me, college. American ruling class incompetent increasingly blaming powerless decisions ruling class clearly made. people wanted collect rent students, demanded kids return dorms midst pandemic. kids sick, they're blaming kids intentionally getting sick. I‚Äôm sure helicopters already way help out! 80-90% likely, similar live attenuated vaccines 95%+ efficacy antigen vaccines often sub 70% supervising this?

Apparently they've arguing behind closed doors. Useless bunch morons, incompetent.

That's literally Belgium. megacoalition left center fucked sidelined right populists done much better.

There competency vote on. bankrupted casinos largely due money laundering practices. Aside that, agree you. Trump wins tho, Jan come go. Help exactly? governments developed nations like UK US enough science medical experts hand know resources implement it. We're mishandling pandemic politics lack knowledge resources. Outside influence change damn thing. infected presymptomatic test negative develop symptoms days later. negative coronatest quarantine give permission leave house mandatory 10 days over. Yeah, live Europe surge never really happened badly. Covid patients separated ER patients. I've saying - we'd wear fucking mask, could go back normal-ish. one time lot people stubbornly insisted drunk driving, despite loads evidence terrible danger society. reason reduced places steep fines severe consequences. Certainly state local governments could use revenue fines distancing mask scoffers. lockdown like super-mask, lowers curve lot... could go back masks without lockdown would eventually get there, lockdowns like super charge start. yes, lockdown necessary, jump start downward curve. problem this, article headline phrase ""than reported"" it. numbers reported? numbers see every government health site, every national local news outlet, etc? Answer, number people died Covid. stating 75,000 ""more reported"" intentionally deceptive. flashy headline meant get people read article.

How holes Swiss cheese created interesting side note

Someone saying use cheese mask Cars BIPOC. kill BIPOC every year group. +1000 Qatar study published August, means data that. virus even circulating long. 

Moreover, lest testing early days, good data people infected earliest days. 

And people mild asymptomatic re-infections get tested

which means expect big undercount. 

In short, really idea common rare reinfection is, changes time. definitely know people understand going on. awful.

Anyway, point like types articles. There's many variables declare US ""the worst"". They've really bad.

Still, people area probably way lax comes distancing, lot due parties lowers odds viral load get it, wouldn‚Äôt severe. Nothing 100%. That‚Äôs exactly graphic saying.   ...avoid politics Vaccines often give stronger longer-lasting immunity natural immunity. 

Also, get booster shots.

I guess would pain arm go get booster shot every six months, that's is, that's is. Plus, later generations vaccines likely better initial ones. Exactly. probably find aviation safety poster version hanging virtually every airline training center. Really? don‚Äôt say? couldn‚Äôt possibly vast majority ‚ÄúCoronavirus deaths‚Äù Coronavirus deaths! There‚Äôs enormous difference ‚ÄúJoe happened Coronavirus died 93 heart failure‚Äù ‚ÄúCoronavirus killed Joe.‚Äù countries seem problems understanding this, since it‚Äôs made political theater liberals here, that‚Äôs possible. Singapore has, what, last checked 57,000 cases 27 deaths?! 0.05% mortality rate, that‚Äôs case fatality rate infection fatality rate. Even assuming everyone tested, it‚Äôs illustrative extremely low fatality rate virus. old fat man call President issues back office weekend. 25-year-old liberals cowering basement nothing. Look France past 5 days want scared. plane full septuagenarians?? Maintaining illusion. stuff pretty relevant 5000 bad compared 277 671 even 346 guess end fairly weak vaccine. 

That would make trials side effects would modest, also much.

That could end making things even worse encourages end social distancing mask usage. true, part ""yikes"" reaction ignorance poster's statement. nursing home residents affected this.

Embarrassment least Americans worries _WE EVEN KNOW PERSON VACCINE PLACEBO GROUP YET._ already reports doctors journalist arrested early January Chinese social media.

""They're gonna survive. They'll illness like flu someday, with. worth risk."" roads 60mph bike lanes berms? D.C. stranger thought. Serious question: point would concede Sweden handled well? places like Bergamo local crisis places like New Zealand deaths. would Sweden need fall adjust judgement efficacy? used within top 5 countries deaths per capita (primarily due nursing home deaths mind you, bracket that). became top ten, top fifteen. Sweden somehow reduced deaths countries, locked extremely hard, surpassed deaths per capita. Soon Sweden top fifteen based current trends France, Columbia Argentina. situation still quite fluid even render final judgement yet? China shut Wuhan January, fact took two months Americans prepare completely them. probably set record fastest recovery time knowing him.

Trump currently holds record lol. want safe effective. 

Other additional factors long immunity lasts, easy produce distribute, it‚Äôs one injection two.

We don‚Äôt enough information vaccines yet start comparing them. 

I would personally trust Chinese vaccine especially since distributing internationally...but you‚Äôll ignore probably shattered several ethical norms produce it. Yet liberal co-workers joke take seriously us vanish coming it. July they've forgotten continue treat joke. Republicans poorly containing it. young people general. mean lot factors exercise go weight get right it'd invite lot unnecessary mean-spirited comments. spouse dropped 50 pounds since March using Ring Fit weight set got Best Buy, I've dropped 30 experimenting pescatarian cooking, yeah, spend time home weight sabotage folks claiming. regret able go physical therapy use heated pool aquatic exercise, that's chronic pain issue rather ""Needa Get Swole"" one. majority Americans least 1 comorbidity.

Yeah ain‚Äôt got none doggone new fangle gyms *checks notes* 6,130,000 person DC metro area. We‚Äôre bunch rural dirt farmers.

Why stay masked long takes? really much inconvenience worth people dying. economy depend mass gatherings either. complete lockdown, moderate sustained lockdown. headline literally says: ""U.S. Virus-Death Rate **World‚Äôs Worst** Among Developed Nations""

All showed US worst countries. Yes, know. headline claims US literally #1 worst death rate developed countries. true. Italy 75 cases /100.000 pop last 14 days.

Exasperating. Maybe crosspost r/cheese? Yes, side effects covid vaccine much worse something like flu vaccine, widespread use. 

But people get vaccine would get COVID, simply what's worse, covid vaccine. nuanced that. Also, vaccine failure could catastrophic future public health undermining public's trust vaccine. 

For Moderna one, small state trial, rate things like fever I've never seen approved vaccine. That's worrisome. larger trials get worse that, still might viable, warning sign, imo. pessimist says COVID 20 America lives two-sides bullshit.  checked Texan excess mortality data? current report July. won‚Äôt able draw real conclusions year. three. flu

Maybe - find much easier comply public health guidelines messaging clear article : **Hunker brutal winter, vaccine spring/early summer, hit maskless Luke Bryan^ concert friends late summer**. this, this. messaging ‚Äúoh, well *might* see normal 2021, might still wear masks distance vaccine widely available‚Äù makes hard buy-into locked winter.

But it‚Äôs ideal. Socialization one aspects school value most.  People fucking dumb.

Chrystal charms? admission can't argue point? satire? doctors say? Western Australia ‚Äòhardest‚Äô border Australia. community transmissions 6 months, cases overseas interstate travellers forced quarantine. might able guess happens consumer spending workplace security essentially longer risk COVID (and even flu effectively eliminated Australia year due social distancing requirements), things basically back pre-COVID normal. WA also posted $1.2 billion dollar budget surplus despite hard border. Happened country (3rd world country). Specifically, happened neighbour. mom died, symptom related covid found SWAB test negative. deceased treated like covid victim (corpse plastic bag, sealed coffin, etc). son argued hospital could took back mom getting buried COVID protocol properly treat bury according religion. honestly confuse hospital would give back truly COVID victim.

It's happened 2 months ago. news probably spread hoax US? Ok I‚Äôll research start using alcohol based sanitizer instead tea tree oil. 

I hate coworkers. Yea, complications, Covid itself. Considering that's multiple grams purified protein grown animal tissue culture, I'm quite surprised low! Kinda weird Covid conspiracy theorists say exact thing. I‚Äôm cautious driver, haven‚Äôt much parking ticket almost 10 years.

Empty road, cops, fast car. blast. made up. liver cancer car wreck whatever, test covid positive, died covid thats gets reported. Sounds like plot George Sonos end world me! /s really isn‚Äôt difference. deaths fact Covid, never tested after. yeah misleading title all. think extra 75,000 people died reason all? stress? Nope, Covid, increased mortality rates significantly.   lmfao retarded could say america? nearly every post america. 350 million + live there, vast majority world dont even live there, let people post whatever country want. ‚Äúclosing bars restaurants‚Äù hardly constitutes lockdown. drama level bit misleading. think one clear coronavirus without necessarily developing antibodies -- immune mechanism(s).

China allowed people Wuhan travel internationally domestically.
I believe anything comes China. shit scary considering fact many Americans die things well everyday pretty soon we‚Äôll dead here. Heard 11 month two ago, 23 probably accurate. either case, rate low really matter. plenty deaths home accounted

Yeah he‚Äôs better billionaires, ones us responsible far ongoing impending catastrophes. lie countries reasonable pandemic plan make difference second wave arrived.

That's true. Even though Italy disastrous first wave, got numbers down, saved thousands lies. US failed this, never got numbers down.

You created false equivalency, two countries end similar positions, negates success Italy saw getting numbers down.

It matter. would mattered US. That's lie. Yup, like guy said, true. Source - wife provider MCV Richmond, VA. 

There deaths attributed covid probably directly/indirectly caused it. instance (this one examples provided her), contractor dies fell roof tests positive covid, there's way determine whether covid made dizzy/fatigued/off balance led fall, include statistics. there's way hell inflates numbers anywhere near crackpot conspiracy theorists believe. 

Also plenty deaths home accounted for, I'd say evens pretty well. made sure protect family friends' wishes rules. live virus free lockdown (mostly, hold rules like dancefloors nightclubs example) months.

The part country real lockdown point Melbourne due bigger second wave starting ease well.

Things worked early well: 


\- closed state borders stop spread region region. greatly simplified contact tracing.

\- large scale contact tracing. allowed early active information policing control spread, able warn people visited certain place get tested.

\- large scale testing make tracing possible.

\- paid people not-work therefore stay safe virus-free.

\- reopening virus controlled. flatten curve call job done, shown try control virus simply infectious.

&amp;#x200B;

These steps isolation obviously help also multiplicative forming cohesive powerful strategy. Every afternoon state health minister put report many cases state had, many new, etc. also helped create sense we're together could see real success happened. course, still crazies opposed personal, political, etc reasons people either ignored punished. life less normal. Short term pain long term gain. 80s know time left world limited, want spend little left locked room.

If government competent, nobody would need spend lot time locked room all. look places like Hong Kong, New Zealand, China, Vietnam, Australia, Singapore, Korea. pretty much beaten covid government vigilant potential outbreaks. 100% agree. risk rushing vaccine backfire side effects COVID. sudden downtick people vaccinating incredibly serious diseases fear vaccines. That's scares me... died pandemic? Assuming assessment reinfection correct, hundred outliers among millions cases change fundamental understanding derive degree immunity infection. Several media outlets irresponsible way covered story, scaring people idea acquired immunity when, fact, strong evidence points fact is. admire effort backpedaling, twisting words, straight lying, actually admire that. 

Interesting words analyze sarcastic post implied know anyone died indirectly result pandemic, SARS-cov2 virus. Let know confusing way. hilarious sad oh reddity.

You mean yourself.  know? Vietnam Thailand lie too? Smart people wait massive community spread acting stop it.

Instead, try prevent gets bad. NZ wisely did.

If patient cancer, ignore hits Stage 4. Instead, try eliminate Stage 1. Delays matter life death.

Other first world nations lack resources. lack political will. Here's happens someone tests positive:

* Whole city goes lockdown immediately.
* Millions people get tested 3 days.
* Cases get isolated.
* City reopens.

That's efficient government looks like. closing borders useless virus already everywhere. Feels like tide turning. think call Fauci conservative says it'll completely behind us end 2021 **if** people abide restrictions, people get vaccinated. that's still big enough days. one cares Opps bad. put place they. tired today.
I change Except nowhere, NZ included, resources ""weeks earlier"" determine lot community spread. I'm sure located, I'm one early lockdown places, assure mid-March still testing people confirmed travel symptoms. NZ closing borders *later* countries implemented full lockdowns worked way lucky community spread. assholes Israel go fuck selfishly screwing rest us(it's giant issue Israel). Hah get it.

So argument flat wrong. number. number. never gave number. quoting CDC. CDC's number.

So question. CDC's number wrong so, why? agree you. I‚Äôm also frustrated absolutes throughout time, especially recent weeks pandemic. It‚Äôs can‚Äôt anything hole up, go weddings/concerts/large gatherings. 

I‚Äôve ranted media I‚Äôll again, ‚Äúnever going back normal‚Äù narrative heavily damaged public‚Äôs way thinking. wish hunker cautious prepping long term, want ‚Äúget life‚Äù throw caution wind media makes pandemic seem never ending.

Everyone lost sight transience situation. It‚Äôs hard, it‚Äôs long haul, yes ‚Äî life won‚Äôt like right forever. Maybe never eradicate covid, don‚Äôt need normalcy return. 

It isn‚Äôt black white life versus giving restrictions entirely. There‚Äôs middle ground living, calculated risks, it‚Äôs possible safe things. 

I‚Äôm 34, I‚Äôm fit, lung injury autoimmune disease gives 1/5 shot right gate severe case. I‚Äôm also nurse, mom three littles.. yeah, covid scares crap me. isn‚Äôt ‚Äújust‚Äù old people, obese, frail severely impacted. 

Media sucks. you‚Äôre going out, mask up. Distance. isn‚Äôt permanent. also strong antivaxx traditions almost always source measles outbreaks America. rabbi seemed right intentions wrong execution would nervous EU vaccine US vaccine regulators.

Seems like EU regulators using looser restrictions US. US require 2 months data half stage 3 participants already got second shot, EU, CND already started review process. Breonna Taylor thread /r/news locked. Wow, followed Denmark closely yeah seem bucking trend. Might bit reading.

Re: Sweden seem following general European trend upward albeit much gently? (Which guess tbf right, probably 'pretty well') 

It's depressing, seem anyone West able avoid second wave sort without following NZ/AU closed borders model (putting aside Denmark say). üò≠ Denmark? know that. üôÇ keep thinking 2021 over, seem like that's gonna happen.

That never realistic goal begin with. never accepted it. think discussing science pedantic bad thing. Study paused 1st person got symptoms, apparently back July. heard subs moderators deleting threads Lol. Headline: ‚ÄúJack Jill concussed nonessential hill, Governor promises entire state flattened end year‚Äù Totally normal country live in.

^/s want whatever smoking Makes since.... end quarter needed fudge numbers..... mind bodies back really interesting see people color hats wearing mask issues crazy horse, Rushmore couple hours later, poof, gone like magic. There's never going vaccine kind coronavirus, sooner people realize better media differentiate deaths infected virus deaths related virus general. Peoples fear anxiety comes fluffed numbers deaths think deaths people virus deaths not. Pandemic means world wide. entire world political agenda? thought one main symptoms heart attack heaviness left side chest, one ever said different women. right, Americans allowed practice First Amendment rights. free exercise religion freedom assembly literally sentence constitution. Well said. There‚Äôs reason immune system would uniquely unable respond coronavirus.

You realize life-long immunity virus extremely rare limited specific viruses right? 

Frequent study Human Coronavirus causes common cold consistently found immunity lasted 3-6 months subjects actually got infected virus twice one cold season.

So actually developed lifelong immunity SARS-CoV-2, would exception norm. ... never try falsify conspiracy theories apply sort critical thinking skills.

So nurses hospitals engaging fraud expected personally held liable behavior? spending time state summer, percentage seems awfully low. wear anti mask ness political flags proud outside small town businesses. another global lockdown series lockdown next years.

It imply thing.

The odds therapies developed improve recovery reduce severity illness far greater odds developing vaccine.

There plenty diseases vaccines exist. mean nothing done manage them.

We necessarily need vaccine all. bet one developed time. scientists believe miracles. half Nobel peace prize winners Christians.

The Nobel Peace Prize one five Nobel Prizes established Alfred Nobel, along prizes Chemistry, Physics, Physiology Medicine, Literature. 

**Since March 1901, awarded annually (with exceptions) ""done best work fraternity nations, abolition reduction standing armies holding promotion peace congresses"".**

Perhaps getting Nobel prizes mixed up?

Regardless people's personal beliefs, **proper science use empirical evidence ascertain truth phenomenon, ""believe**"".

You beliefs respect others beliefs right beliefs, still use science. one wants read stuff live. It‚Äôs embarrassing. lot better controlling spread disease. Whatever doing, keep up! usually story nautical accidents well. It‚Äôs series poor decisions failures leading one epic failure. They're troops. probably licked armrests.

Poor souls. says still voting trump... what? country people abandoned masks, kind social distancing, travel restrictions travel restrictions. Government anything locking infected homes still virus virtually non-existent. city nobody sick death rate normal. Hospitals overwhelmed people living without problem.  that's closest one right? others delayed? nope. blocked remember happening, lot people post Sweden forum congratulating Swedish government great job managing pandemic. Stricter regulations? compare two trials Oxford vaccine US U.K.? U.K. trial single blind! can‚Äôt convince organization approved final phase clinical trial may critical vaccine hundreds years didn‚Äôt require quad blinding ‚Äúinfamously strict‚Äù He's talking taxing. thinks taxes theft. sure you‚Äôre trolling skipped biology. 

Through metastasis, cells run cycles cycle incorrect body kills off. cancerous cells. you‚Äôre healthy, without abnormalities, cells killed cycle. Coronavirus? makes sense heath fiscal standpoint consolidate office space companies. It‚Äôs win-win scenario everyone sounds like something could decent writeup on, present /r/TIL fact people reiterate next couple years, though.

Novelty beats verifiability. I'm adding layer rye bread. wasn‚Äôt empty there, people happily masked even hiking trails. 

It also place country outside home felt actually felt like live able place. yet still highest death rates governor condemned thousands die sending covid infected people nursing homes. lockdown slow spread prolong pandemic. going burn population one way another.

How much longer people going harp this. Yea, beginning mess ups, correct things implemented (mask mandates, lockdown, social distancing) death rate infection rate went way things opened up. even talking indoor dining limited capacity, one densest cities country. Florida example, idiot government ignored covid they're one infected, infected state country. Congrats. higher infections new york. want willingly ignore thing 99.4% overall survival rate deaths occurring overwhelming elderly people pre existing conditions let see way out. wanna rain apocalypse parade. I'll living life way want.

HAHAH LOL holy fuck literally one people talking last reply who's giving fuck public safety precautions. wonder new rules. believe big deal. 

You prime example rules forced everyone individuals extremely stupid, like you, never make correct public health choices. 

Have ever thought bad logic this? Every single country world panic thing preventative rules like lockdowns. thinking big deal. 

If big deal, literally every single country planet trying prevent spreading? guess either say they're trying limit freedom they're reacting. said science idk supposed if/what aspect you‚Äôre talking think ordinary procedure allow old people back homes well again? would guess discharged hospital soon feel better, hospital stays insanely expensive US, dont think anyone wants stay longer absolutely necessary.

In case nursing homes NY attempted quarantine upon return, didnt necessarily always work. footing bill keep people hospital longer showing symptoms, sometimes take months? Tuesday reports first since Friday previous week that's less 4 days week rough rounding seem misleading? Especially starts ""I think.."" struggle find dishonesty idea rare is. 

Some proven cases literally person asymptomatic times, many one time. could pretty common necessarily know common. ""So remember human factors since last brief?""

'SWISS CHEESE"" Interesting drug used parasites works virus. Sweden‚Äôs approach response virus clearly inferior neighbors. Wear mask, helps combat spread virus. ludicrous mask mandate virus spreading air. russia china vaccines legit? Ah see, better explained article. mention article talks Netherlands, USA. Lol, becuase want know Trump got infected...it's want reveal many people infected. Hello CatOwlLife, ban evading we? killed 225k americans alone 1 million worldwide Speaking Denmark, wear masks AFAIK, strictly Italy Spain do.

Point is, sub tends extreme mantras (masks one-fits-all solution, everyone New Zealand, etc.etc.). Reality complex. Denmark, massive daily testing, basic rules generally respected people:

-maintain social distancing possible;

-work home possible;

-isolate sick (as in, showing potential covid symptoms);

-avoid parties large gatherings generally behave sensibly responsibly.

I guess countries need harsher rules, maybe works Scandinavian societies. still way early see whether decrease Denmark blip maintained long-term.  are. called pine box well wishes. could people sick Covid people dieing due circumstances, know matters.

If pandemic response causing change mortality pattern thats resulting additional +80% deaths young, otherwise healthy people dying despair lack access basic medical care, time re-evaluate we're responding, least declare March July, shutting everything implicit argument people matter.

Not sure trying suggest argument matter. absolutely matter. drive conversation treat moving forward. Lockdowns prevent 40 year olds getting heart checkups maybe save 96 year olds terrible policy. think less less bad reinfection coz body antibodies previous infection. again, scientist... think herd versus lockdown bit false choice. successful countries go mask wearing middle ground. saying all.

We achieve it. Levels HI ebb wane time. eventually get there. 

Eventually. certainly do, happens everyday every country government exists. Sheep call taxation. Educated people know robbery. funny thing is, actually consider pretty conservative. thing perfect media outlet think it‚Äôs important able recognize biases each, read lines factual information. 

When comes COVID, also like read primary source information much possible. difficult digest times, pretty strong background science, I‚Äôd rather read/analyze data &amp; read researchers‚Äô conclusions firsthand rather rely journalists accurately interpret convey information me. realize everyone spend time effort though. proven cases, runs gamut, asymptomatic times, way death second time. every combination between. 

Here's 23 proven cases proven cases virus genetically sequenced times different strains (removing possibility residual first infection).

My guess something like initial viral load exposure infection explains much variation severity, that's guess. either it, going get it. Vermont swamped people now.  ‚ÄúGDP growth higher expected‚Äù says biggest gdp fall history.

&amp;#x200B;

Your entire argument false dilemma. options ""send kids back school ***or*** continue lockdown"".

The best option continue lockdown, improve remote learning, increase financial support families affected lockdown, improve safety measures around essential workers directly indirectly involved industries like food. Accidents often result three compounding mistakes.  Here‚Äôs fun fact: cancer cells, right now!

Also completely fucking false. 

You obviously born next nuclear power plant. Coronavirus going reality vs ideology actually completed dosing entire population reasonably would 2k adverse events 100 would died.

If we‚Äôre going avoid COVID vaccine one vaccine 30 years killed extra person per 1% population inoculated, we‚Äôre really bad math. RATE going lol ""But researchers determined nearly 75,000 additional deaths indirectly caused pandemic, bringing total number deaths four months 225,000. '

What even mean? old person dying, cold isnt listed ' death cold' old age.

Should different rules COVID? Yeah, know, *believe* people *mean* keggers boring old cow name like Bertha Minnie keep playing bridge knitting. GOD, *boring*! Can't fuck die thing? important. incorrect. Dr. Fauci testified Congress stated condone attending BLM Old people room whole country, really anyone else. apparently even value lives. ""Practically"" 
That qualifier means completely contained it.
Its still there, spread. Hey talking points like 7 weeks old. Get new memo! H1b horror show want get talent need give green cards day one citizenship 7 years Except numbers higher ever places above, like Europe Canada. evidence ivermectin's effectiveness mounting. old ""is ethical give people placebo potentially deadly disease"" argument likely rear head again. wonder desperate? he's one day away completing quarantine sure person asking, previous Tuesday bit special (there correction resulted -12 reported deaths), one 10 deaths, one 5. 10 question Tuesday report recent weeks - 4 days delay since last report average death 1-2 per day, also lag 10 days reporting. You‚Äôre funny. 

Here‚Äôs fun fact: cancer cells, right now!  feel like massively scammed. zero.
And point. understand basic math science gathered. Gotha. Thanks fully explaining that. guess 300,000 number 100% accurate official exact number. never proved false, fact case partially written communication lawyer confirmed anally raped woman drunk said no. document legally cannot used court, pretty much prove happened. 

And even turned false, would pay much hush money otherwise instead fighting case? 

It's pretty evident man despicable human deserve constant praise riches gets. can't believe takes bloody netflix documentary 10 years line people media finally accept stop supporting monsters.

edit: change facts above, United fan obviously huge CR7 fan came light. feel people heads ass comes looking objectively people idolise ""Completely Normal"" Japan involves level cleanliness (and voluntary masking) far beyond western countries.

The interesting thing heavy use crowded public transportation led Covid transmission. seems imply masking works situations. class weakest sounding thing I've ever heard. 

You've clearly never properly participated spin class. kick ass harder regular bike ride right. Many cyclists, included, used spin bikes supplement training.

I always enjoyed watching haughty fitness folks take first spin class. Shuts right up. states also experiences surges? are, run beds? That‚Äôs individual strategy, protecting vulnerable letting everyone else go back normal would require absolutely massive increase federal state government spending months planning. government provide housing people live people work, provide meals, etc. According [John's true. America ranks 3rd worst among developed nations. Still good means, still worst. least yet. America's death rate creeping faster Spain's, exceeding Spain probably happen end year. really keeping track Belgium though. New York City's ENTIRE population died COVID.

Yes, 100% NYC infected. IFR math is: many people died / many TOTAL people INFECTED.

You need know many infected, including asymptomatic, mild cases get IFR number. surprising. hospitals restrict operations, overwhelmed, people afraid them, people receive preventative maintenance even critical care. ironic thing children didn‚Äôt receive vaccines diseases could even dangerous.

Also, 75,000 even including spikes drug overdoses suicides result pandemic forced closures. careful ivermectin dogs dosage. think ""barely"" correct word, many papers data understand works. remember well. wrong lying big deal area TN. still close friends saying masks family choice. believe Fox. get ""Good News"" tag one? would predict China‚Äôs vaccine safe effective. scientists know doing, smart politically...they don‚Äôt want distribute bad vaccine world wide. going want heroes pandemic, especially considering ‚Äúfirst world‚Äù countries struggled. 

I suspect sped trials really volunteers...they basically told military (and others), ‚Äúyou phase 3, getting injected this.‚Äù That‚Äôll get results fast. also wouldn‚Äôt rule done secret challenge trials tbh that‚Äôs speculation.

They also production mass distribution point, shown administering 7million tests seven days 12 cases. Basically, want something done, money politics isn‚Äôt obstacle...they it. I'm sure virus cares laws; maybe time pass new ones. Keep telling that... helps sleep night. Without read entire paper percent people wore mask diagnosed Covid meaningless without knowing total percentage population always wears mask.

 It‚Äôs sort like anti vaxers say 50% whatever measles cases outbreak vaccinated people. Sure 95% population vaccinated indicates lower risk. spin class, right, absolutely spewing air germs everywhere. Worse singing. it? knew bad February? big deal now?

guys like hard time understanding ""racism"" reaction shutdown targeting China. nothing. entire border needed closed - to/from everywhere. point made - lockdowns. know understand - ... keep spreading nonsense ... asshole. Oh jeez. real stats? Nah according subreddit every single person gets COVID ends permanent lung damage. stupid people. Everyone pretty much equally selfish really. Americans maybe slightly better culture individualistic europe, nah. Everyone end desires love free really care much issues touch moment. Yeah, funny constantly go back talking point travel ban. 

""Oh wow, realize president do. Seems strange 200k deaths, say so"" - sarcastically would hope obvious considering we've shut like 6 months now. Key phrase *I would hope* though Well, could always donate windfall profits way people roll nowadays. Instead, shelter monies offshore claim hardships screw everyone. damn congress tax mom pop shops every dime get.  

Edit: Besides tax passed would major loopholes buddies making symbolic usual. hold banner touting wonders buddies driving behind brinks trucks loaded cash shielded banners. use different type Estimate, I‚Äôm official number, table isn‚Äôt saying claiming. So, make lies CDC? Plus yet numbers don‚Äôt even claim said initially. mean? case numbers? go cases per capita. Obviously France higher total numbers 4 times population Netherlands. cases per capita Netherlands much worse numbers. 7383 cases Netherlands equals almost 30,000 cases France. equal France reporting 30,000 cases per day. equal US reporting 147,000 cases per day. per capita numbers Netherlands currently much higher almost anywhere else. wonderful news! guess get head little what‚Äôs plan Australia NZ reopen borders? Even there‚Äôs vaccine, likely won‚Äôt effective enough completely stop virus spreading. Let‚Äôs say make getting vaccine mandatory, open borders - going accept cases community?

Yes, freedom important safety. new york, forced lockdowns/mask/social distancing/testing cases (or recently) one thousand day, NEW YORK, one biggest densest cities country. 

And yet still highest death rates governor condemned thousands die sending covid infected people nursing homes. lockdown slow spread prolong pandemic. going burn population one way dead covid now.

If want willingly ignore thing 99.4% overall survival rate deaths occurring overwhelming elderly people pre existing conditions let see way out. wanna rain apocalypse parade. I'll living life way redneck people states dumb fuck 


This tells everything need know way view world. maSks WOrk sIX FeEt? requested stay home. went work everyday, one asked out. one forced stay home. Like many others. people mask, refuse wear one city mask mandates. Many states governor's want fight mayors counties trying mask mandates. Many mayors sheriffs want ignore state mask mandates. certain retail stores requiring them, would practically non-existent. many anti-maskers refuse go businesses, even went before. oh no, poor businesses suffering masks.



If real lockdown people streets guns protesting, would forcing everyone back inside.


Most people preppers stocked bunker hide year two. need go work, shop, school, live lives. need someone them. 


Who hell everyone socializing with? People without jobs co-workers? People without neighbors? People without friends? People without family? everyonele going big brave, passing along everyone else!


Selfish shortsighted fools. fair haven‚Äôt even gotten yet. Trump made coronavirus. Pence secretly lizard monster planet Xenon take Tobasco Sauce.

This sound. think point/side here? got smaller holes tho. love cheese. good Well good know cheese get corona table mean 110,000 200,000 covid19 deaths include pneumonia? possible? working remotely permanently can‚Äôt happier Roger. I'd rather adopt Swedish respiratory virus defense.

* 0-1 deaths/day
* Lower deaths/million US
* lockdown
* mask wearing aggravating many people capacity understand simple concept choose get cheap zingers covid precautions. holes need bigger that. Oh, man... lemme tell super deadly disease around world zero cure, get, even stayed inside forever...

It‚Äôs called... cancer... Virginia. cast wide net get kind accuracy positivity rating asymptomatic cases accurate death rate. Anyone dyeing home test part autopsy extremely unlikely many people fell cracks there. person responding actually read article would know saying death toll higher due people afraid go hospital reasons health/mental health issues due lockdowns. someone dyeing home heart attack could saved afraid go hospital.  mean, year longer live brings year closer possible future cure aging... first ""immortal"" could alive today know. that‚Äôs one layer out. still clean surfaces, social distance, wash hands, practice hygiene. Another argument action NZ taken centrally countries like Germany work effectively 16 different countries, health local matter local states charge it. 

In cases one three parties ruling state, like case Berlin, currently shitshow. Merkel say whatever wants can't decide us, end decision Berlin Senat decide.

Is thing Spain, Comunidad Autonoma managing situation themselves, cannot close borders communities states. meant philosophical academic standpoint. Every regulator call whatever want - ORM, ISMS, PSM etc.  know Sweden can't lock completely law right? Best news I‚Äôve heard day. There‚Äôs need retribution cops atrocities committed - virus dirty work.

If cops wanted us like them, maybe shouldn‚Äôt kill many us. Maybe respected women people color. Maybe shouldn‚Äôt killing children shooting 13 times. Maybe shouldn‚Äôt shooting us back 7 times front children. 

The US largest prison population human history. prisoners world well - sheer number prisoners percentage population incarcerated. profit prisons, something history books aghast future (assuming species future). 

They asking evil hath wrought bring punishment upon themselves. also like 11 years ago Yep also said WHO. point still stands. impossible no-win decision. many people would died people hoarded masks hospitals first responders ran out?

But let's pretend anti-maskers actually anti-mask Fauci's comments months ago. That's flimsy pretext selfishness laziness. Well fuck thought may learned something. educated. Brainwashed. Rotate second slice. Problem solved. We're talking article, specifically talking NON-Covid deaths pandemic result people seeking treatment conditions. title intentionally worded mislead people believing 75,000 Covid deaths, patently untrue.

If put going doctor 6 months end dying complications diabetes, that's Covid death. highly doubt volunteers told safe. don‚Äôt first hand knowledge, would bet there‚Äôs stack paperwork need go detailing risks testing unproven vaccine medicine. Ford Microsoft, white-collar companies increasingly extending working home next summer.

When coronavirus pandemic shuttered offices around United States March, many companies told employees would short hiatus away headquarters.

Workers, said, would back cubicles within matter weeks. Weeks turned September. September turned January. now, virus still surging parts country, growing number employers delaying return-to-office dates again, summer 2021 earliest.

Google one first announce July 2021 return-to-office date. Uber, Slack Airbnb soon jumped bandwagon. past week, Microsoft, Target, Ford Motor New York Times said they, too, postponed return in-person work next summer acknowledged inevitable: pandemic isn‚Äôt going away anytime soon.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs bite bullet,‚Äù said Joan Burke, chief people officer DocuSign San Francisco. August, company, manages electronic document signatures, decided would allow 5,200 employees work home June 2021.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre still place evolving,‚Äù said. ‚ÄúNone us answers.‚Äù

Many companies expected delay return-to-office dates keep workers safe. workers said rush go back, 73 percent U.S. employees fearing workplace could pose risk personal health safety, according study Wakefield Research commissioned Envoy, workplace technology company.

More companies also saying institute permanent work-from-home policies employees ever come office again.

In May, Facebook one first announce would allow many employees work remotely even pandemic. Twitter, Coinbase Shopify also said would so. Friday, Microsoft announced would also part shift.

he elongating timelines changing policies add continued balancing act companies coronavirus shatters work norms upends assumptions workers need achieve maximum productivity. Employers also pressure open possible intentions workers plan ahead lives.

The postponement return dates ‚Äúpsychological blow expected transition phase,‚Äù said Tsedal Neeley, Harvard Business School professor studies remote work. ‚ÄúThe reality hitting that, ‚ÄòThere won‚Äôt vaccine expected quickly. going life, I‚Äôd better learn this.‚Äô‚Äù

Dr. Neeley likened situation waiting airport terminal flight continually delayed. new dates announced, said, people finally start adjusting temporary ‚Äúgrinning bear it‚Äù approach permanent shift.

Successful companies ‚Äúhave begun think long-term strategy rather ‚ÄòLet‚Äôs survive crisis,‚Äô‚Äù said.

Much corporate America following lead Silicon Valley tech companies like Google Facebook. among allowed employees work home even pandemic hit full force March. Since then, Facebook set tone planning permanent remote work, Google established July 2021 target date returning office.

‚ÄúI hope offer flexibility need balance work taking care loved ones next 12 months,‚Äù Google‚Äôs chief executive, Sundar Pichai, wrote email employees July 2021 date.

Other employers soon emulated tech giants, also citing worker flexibility key factor pushing return-to-office dates next summer.

Ms. Burke, DocuSign executive, said announcing June 2021 return date employees prompted ‚Äúcollective sigh relief inside company‚Äù put end incremental postponements uncertainty would expected return.

Remote work productive, said, people like commute. mix in-person remote probably popular option employees life returns normal, said, also miss social interaction office space.

Zoom ‚Äúis thing, it‚Äôs exhausting,‚Äù Ms. Burke said. ‚ÄúBy 7 o‚Äôclock last night, Zoomed out.‚Äù

Other companies delayed returns office next summer often face complicated decision work forces made white-collar engineers, unlike internet companies.

Ford said last week decision hold back in-person office work June 2021 would apply roughly 32,000 employees North America already working remotely. company, 188,000 employees, said policy apply factory staff.

When Target announced decision let employees continue work home June 2021 letter staff last week, said would apply employees headquarters Minneapolis. company said small number employees rely headquarters facilities would continue work on-site. In-store employees work retail stores usual.

Some companies already tried bringing employees back office grappled safety concerns. Last month, Goldman Sachs JPMorgan Chase sent send workers back home employees returned office tested positive virus.

Tech companies also forefront permanent work-from-home policies digital work often simpler people conduct via laptops teleconferences site.

Slack told employees ‚Äî many engineers ‚Äî early August offices would remain closed June 2021 considering permanent work-from-home, decision partly driven productive employees remotely, said Robby Kwok, chief staff Slack‚Äôs chief executive.

‚ÄúI think flexibility employers giving employees needing come office five days week going extremely beneficial productivity, engagement,‚Äù Mr. Kwok said.

Even pandemic subsides, 72 percent Slack employees surveyed said, preferred company allow mix at-home office work. Slack operates messaging platform used many businesses.

Still, tech companies reservations embracing permanent remote work might lost process. Rapid7, cybersecurity company Boston, told 1,600 employees would continue work home beginning 2021. company said best work in-person collaboration, pandemic changed that.

‚ÄúWe know meant 100 percent remote,‚Äù said Christina Luconi, company‚Äôs chief people officer. ‚ÄúWe go back office‚Äù safe so, said.

A push all-company remote work particularly difficult companies predominantly young work forces, said Andy Eichfeld, chief human resources administrative officer credit card company Discover, told employees Sept. 29 would need return office June 2021.

‚ÄúA younger person needs apprenticeship first 10 15 years career,‚Äù Mr. Eichfeld said. ‚ÄúAnd know deliver person. I‚Äôm sure apprenticeship happens remotely.‚Äù

For workers, return date next summer idea permanent work home mixed blessing.

When Colin Fahrion, digital communications specialist University California, San Francisco, found June would need return office least July 2021, moved 15 miles farther away San Francisco, Richmond Vallejo, 30 miles outside city, bought house.

Mr. Fahrion, 47, dedicated office space backyard dog play, talked supervisor working remotely permanent basis. Still, finds Zoom meetings devoid collaborative energy.
