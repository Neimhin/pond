0,2020-09-24," Sorry mean sound like deniers tried downplay virus risk death. meant people talking mostly going die. Yes many become ill maybe even debilitating problems like problem going ""solve itself"" IFR is.

I take virus really seriously friend hospital right now. old weak, unlucky. lot people die disease number people dying going put dent number idiots behaving recklessly endangering others. opening entirely. state revenue. that's view people... think lockdown would effective? Yeah bad, still dumb cdc feels like we're gonna go vaccines several short period. Nov 1? vaccines. Feb 1? Like 5. Helsinki Syndrome! Literally situation England, pubs close 10 Corporation never ‚Äúdo right thing‚Äù Well, sure glass half empty does. total population country irrelevant. Italy probably hundred thousand times science deniers anti-maskers China, makes perfect sense cases


[Protesters far-right activists rally masks seeing ‚ÄòOrange Vests‚Äô movement says coronavirus pandemic doesn‚Äôt even need punished? could just... lock down, bet everything fine. really is. tried supplementing 1000 UI earlier pandemic within 10 days whole face erupted painful cystic acne. sure go since I'm still self isolating home quit sups acne cleared weeks.

Wow ü§© like ""being punished"" people part living society.

This condition healthy society. way disciplining entire class actions disruptive student ethical either. that‚Äôs meant [to be] gloom doom,‚Äù adds. ‚ÄúThe new normal fine, we‚Äôll get fine. don‚Äôt think we‚Äôll go back January lifetime.‚Äù

Sound sounds even worse expected. Sorry hospital workers. wish politicians scientists started throw ideas worst case scenarios seem likely: immunity lasts little there‚Äôs animal reservoirs. people pretending getting smallpox-type vaccine, effectiveness vaccine low article states. way places like NZ could keep current approach illness endemic influenza People fighting last packs. remember day country announced measures everyone went panic shopping frenzy. came home night work, even find fresh veggies meat get normal meal... 

I really hope panic hoarders ashamed idiotic actions sure ones haven‚Äôt suffered (or died) continue live isolated, countries like NZ benefit going back normal. never said would make alive Absolutely one saw coming....

They‚Äôre still super spreaders.

This simply move slow testing,l. bone headed &amp; illogical move quickly got reversed. Regarding militarization they're similar, except democrats want disarm working class matter say..anything pushes state carry normally much humanly possible shot down/down voted that‚Äôs agenda here.

I completely understand saving lives. Let‚Äôs real state..Florida built tourism. Florida survive lockdown kind. Let‚Äôs also real country. Lockdowns probably unconstitutional actually challenged court, would likely turned. 

I support lot measures try put place support telling people business anymore. anyone else doesn‚Äôt want establishment means stay home.

We prepping hospitals surge point. driving unemployment, causing people‚Äôs lives complete shit show controlling people chose live lives ruining mental health. anything Europe proving hiding delaying inevitable. Clearly mental health also starting take toll well there.

Go ahead give shit want fully support freedom choose one manages one life given. I‚Äôve already got COVID, don‚Äôt *live fear*, nothing else (or will) change.

Most businesses closed require masks live, daily life still severely restricted. US senate least representative elected governing body western democracy. compare US governments, we're much, much worse terms Covid response dealing economic repercussions pandemic.

Alternative systems US unknown, untested thing. hundreds systems there, know many work better ours. There's reason expect work better here, too. point strategy needs shift isolating high risk. can't live like years. business based social interaction make it. course live eternity thanks isolation ;) Jim Jones? you?

Thank Sugar, citrus, opiods Talk age discrimination. Wow here‚Äôs shocked face: :| Eve destruction, tax deduction theories completely hypocritical. 

The virus harmless, hate China sending us harmless disease. 

It's harmless, yet furious governers supposedly let harmless disease decimate people. 

It's harmless, thank God hydroxychloroquine, miracle cure disease can't hurt us anyway. never said couldn‚Äôt hate America, rather hate America leave. Italy 60M inahabitants, 2000 cases day, Italy great. China, 2B inhabitants, 2 cases day. Makes sense, right? Yes do. I‚Äôm wondering restrictions decided. said vary state, mean governor decide? mean federal government tell state do? Gator trappin' Read ""poor get COVID-19 first"" Thats right now.
Its really taking toll Police wouldn‚Äôt getting virus weren‚Äôt standing shoulder shoulder beat lines Crazy get downvoted. Probably targeted ccp now...greeeaaaat. Aside couple hundred times number deaths. don‚Äôt understand US government saying expand senate based population. senate represents individual states equally regardless population. doesn‚Äôt matter opinion it. read article. get wrist slap yet? did...by telling GTFO country voicing dessenting opinion regarding I‚Äôm shocked somebody that‚Äôs lived America hates much, w.e. Leave

You somehow think opinion hateful leave based opinion rather defend 1A saying ""i disagree reddit opinion"" said ""gtfo"" rest world missed memo to. first wave tsunami yo people favor social distancing won‚Äôt patronize bars, restaurants, etc. person. 

If pro-mask protests start happening, won‚Äôt effects start really felt- like people told get fired don‚Äôt come back office without mask.

But question presumes ‚Äútwo sides‚Äù equally strong opposing viewpoints; ideology behind mask wearing equally powerful driving vocal anti mask people. haven‚Äôt heard one mask wearer literally cry say masks part God‚Äôs design human body expression constitutional right. Yes nutshell boils choices made current administration. pumped values 70 last year. good everything. relate! stress workplace really screwing mentally. cant quit bills pay extremely hard get new job rm That's people say truth symptomatic enough know it, there's like 10% chance going die. die potentially facing permanent neurological damage, organ damage, blood clots, parkinsons disease, host issues yet discovered. Plus, looks like catch once.

The ""low perctage death"" accounts asymptomatic.

By time disease control we'll looking many millions dead.  protests! protests! protests! followed social distancing wore mask correctly!!! Blame black coat wearing joos /s FAANG gang represent! 50 million cases fluin US year? fucking way. Maybe 5 million 50? sure got that.  getting hand. I'm 30 years old lower risk. point high risk individuals need self isolate let world move on.

After vaccine out, I'm sorry, time go back normal. economic impact kill virus need distance wear masks 2 3 years. mean country curbed pandemic?

The country funded study love tout dangerously ignorantly misinterpret?

That country? must missed memo.... first wave end? think decided state one cohesive national lockdown?

Do think exists kind legislation outlining federal government‚Äôs powers unprecedented pandemic? Everybody know loved ones die day, ley wait? really annoys me. I'm small business owner UK help entitled gone running business keeping going last 6 months following 95% drop income. Starting see light now, still without government help. taxpayer's cash. 

Knowing we're going pay back heavily increased taxation year two really grinds gears companies take something really need waste it.

Hats companies declared they're handing back claimed cash following unexpected bounce profits, tho. Props them. multi-factorial. MDs receive basic education regarding nutrition, non-medication management disease processes, vitamin/mineral/micronutrient needs. Many doctors (general practitioners, internists, hospitalists) even able recognize properly test diagnose diseases caused deficiencies scurvy, rickets, beri beri, kosakoff syndrome, pellagra, zinc, magnesium, iodine, selenium deficiencies. deficiency syndromes diagnosed frequently, false belief rare developed world little attention funds put towards research, screening, professional education regarding these. like perpetual feedback cycle modern medicine. 

In addition this, little financial incentive stakeholders like drug companies fund research regarding topics. Food, vitamins, minerals can't patented, cheap readily available, can't monetized. may long term financial benefit governments promote screening research reduce disease burden therefore costs, however, cost/benefit always pan short term. current cost/benefit beliefs different historical ideas funding programs, much food fortified. 
TLDR; education medicine sorely lacking, research sparse, attention minimal, health practitioners wrongly believe nutritional treatment diseases hooey. come terms bleak future It‚Äôs stress anything else.  panel inspectors general named Glenn Fine ‚Äî acting Pentagon watchdog ‚Äî lead group charged monitoring coronavirus relief effort. Trump Monday [April 6th] removed Fine post, instead naming EPA inspector general serve temporary Pentagon watchdog addition blasted Trump's sudden removal replacement Acting Inspector General Fine part disturbing pattern retaliation president independent overseers fulfilling statutory patriotic duties conduct oversight behalf American people,"" said Speaker Nancy Pelosi Minority Leader ripped Trump's ""corrupt action"" said trying sideline ""honest independent public servants willing speak truth power clearly afraid strong House Armed Services Committee Chairman Adam Smith (D-Wash.) said he's received rationale replacing Fine, accused Trump empowering loyalists officials expertise administration, calling ""epidemic incompetence."" problem is, THINK you‚Äôre less risky population, doesn‚Äôt mean ARE. Plenty otherwise healthy people getting hard, many dying. really crapshoot. quicker. &lt;Pope pulls mask reveal he's Donald part, pro mask/distance people quiet.

Because violent reactions anti-maskers.  guess part reason tune mask usage changed. Good them. Stupendous unbelievable phenomenal amazing shaved head first time lockdown found like look head shaven. count? ""phase 2"" before. ""reopen everything, reduced capacity/distancing rules businesses"".

This ""return business usual, everything fine"". Yeah it‚Äôs like they‚Äôre testing enough something. Im years. happening. goal posts moved many times. Researching getting PPP loan big goal/accomplishment mine spring/summer. read way much it. don‚Äôt literally inoculate America part phase III trial? better way get data giving everybody. dumbsh!ts asking ‚ÄúWhY StOcK MarKeT 44% PaNDEmic ?‚Äù Nah, give better things world. Thank you. People left right believing antibodies defense body disease absolutely unbelievable. Trickle economics failed again? I'm surprised. Said one ever. Apparently, [Cuomo planning slow-roll vaccine New true, fake news? true, good thing bad thing? mean like Taiwan Latvia? Spanish flu effectively ended WW1, Black Death sort ended fuedelism. right, life got back normal eventually, different normal. Kill yo granma Fight right stupid lmao literally math even say anything

You've lost minds think thing remember waves artificially created. 2nd wave Spanish Flu caused millions people returning Europe, current second wave EU caused relaxing restrictions/shoddy test trace.

In April general misconception wages entirely tied weather. reason? matter poor rich. person immune deficiency salaried office job able home-office right employer-based insurance categorically less risk somebody immune deficiency work two jobs Wal-Mart McDonalds exposed every day public health insurance. (US centric example there, make one poor vs rich capitalist country.) Florida: Hold beer Yeah, post only, definitely indicates concerted action vocal minority mod failure rather general sentiment. I've identical comments net difference 30+ votes, negative here, positive posts. Moderna. Moderna still running point?  Oh no! 99.98% survival rate good chance won‚Äôt even *know* unless test tells him!! RUN! *Run lives hide!* inflation caused mismatch currency's purchasing power perceived purchasing power

That called arbitrage opportunity. make money providing gateways markets. IE sell gift cards crypto sell USD.

People often learn languages immersion, books. children learn primary language way. Perhaps need rethink criteria. Feel free link resources think read. read lot mostly mathematics/CS papers. don‚Äôt want UN. want something teeth. done better have. Parents work. lot kids going watching tv day keep quiet. Educational activities aren‚Äôt priority lot families. China (at least don‚Äôt know others) app tracks everyone possibly exposed factors. effectively control access place based green, yellow red code given unknown algorithm.

The problem US Europe places opening quickly without enough testing tracing, etc. condition loan money used salary. Say company got $10m loan. Spent $15m salary, $25m suppliers, $10m dividend that's perfectly find line loan's intent. spend money salary they'll pay back. 

The loans never ""need"" condition attached supposed to. supposed inject money system quickly companies spend lot time qualifying. $1200 tied need. Cornucopia political cartoonists :) - helped enormously. emergency situation people mostly told, long they're hungry. Bodies streets. individuals exercise precaution end day.

I live FL. spouse everything 'right' tested positive. go Disney Universal anything like that. went grocery store, gas station, work. wear masks much surrounded people refuse wear masks keep distance. think misunderstanding independent factors 1918 (wartime medicine, policies transporting sick away frontlines back home, virus type least 4 times mutagenic coronavirii) led genuinely awful outcome. factors present time around, worse second wave, theoretically possible necessarily likely. 
That said, media worrying cases going low level interventions resurging, well founded- that's simple intuition. good point - that's avoided anyone may risk person. circle friends, necessarily strict bubble, we're around 28-29 years, stick with. really met anyone, gone party, seen anyone outside circle while, included mom (who 60 I'd terrified gave her). stick circle, go get groceries, work home. goes ways though. going argue number deaths accurate must concede also deaths attributed Covid. question is, side deviates more? least something might work, NY Jets sure working. course did. lot people distancing six months sick it. government largely moved on, think growing consensus amongst people move on. Financial help isn‚Äôt coming, grand public health policies combat pandemic. People family, friends, lives businesses. 

And increasing number articles statements say won‚Äôt get back normal middle 2021 Fall 2021 ‚Äúpost vaccine still need distance/wear masks won‚Äôt silver bullet‚Äù encourages people throw towel.  Adapt means change. That's good question worthy discussion thread itself. Attitudes changed. Habits changed. Technology changed. marketplace changed. Stores companies visited years vanished possibility coming back people launched long gone. Jobs changed. Delivery drivers demand busboys not. People learned cook sew clean houses. Housekeepers work. Institutions changed. Church changed. School changed. Charity projects changed. 

It's life ended, post-pandemic world going different pre-pandemic world. Marshall law lockdowns mandatory mask wearing limited deaths China.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* No, poor/obese get special priviliges. People get vaccine first: Healthcare workers, military, teachers, senior home residents, police officers, frontline retail workers. people contract HIV, 99.99% infected immediately die. things get pretty dire, without managed medication, years line.

Will long-term-effect COVID-19 anything nearly fatal HIV/AIDS? *Unlikely.* we've already seen confirmed COVID cases also experienced ***damage multiple organ systems.***

I know long-term-effects COVID-19 be. Neither you. Nobody does. Best practice would respect novel virus, cavalier approach.

But you, bud. saying Sweden let virus run wild, actually pursue herd immunity? likely poorly performing nations fractured, unfocused, half-measures? 

I remember checking stats Netherlands maybe month ago, significantly better Sweden (admittedly counted Covid-19 deaths). Either things gotten much worse, one counting badly enough make difference. either case, means they've joined ranks nations worst responses, condolences them. 

I say Belgium counting whole story, might mitigate somewhat, opposed fact vast majority nations counting, dramatic amounts. 

Regardless Sweden got are, preventable deaths they've already coming back, among ranks worst performing. I'm clear many trying ignore fact. 

Edit: minor wording List signatories include: Michael Diamond, Adam Vauch, Adam Horovitz Gov DeSantis really truly Florida-Man!! first state governor forcing herd immunity residence states world generally speaking GOP'ers, old peoples lives don;t matter. Florida State Govt revenue stream life support choose sacrifice profit said interested see list party affiliation. seems elected officials getting COVID Republicans outspoken masks, etc saying Northam fall bucket sound like president commenting border wall. far-right leaders batshit crazy... Trump's plan FUTURE based entirely misconceptions ""herd immunity"" pushing vaccine idea efficacy is... like he's done multiple ""miracle cures.""

If PAST... would already millions dead US. Pandemics alway end socially biologically buddy, fuck Meanwhile Argentina,[politician quits kissing partner‚Äôs breast online legislative scandalous moment, debate pension fund investments, transmitted live lower house‚Äôs YouTube channel giant screen set congress online debates pandemic.

Why gun carrying, mask hating doctors things? 8 hours time thoughts constantly distrupted.

That's working call centers messed head, even anything dramatic ‚Äî¬†I receiving calls mail order items TV. weird, feeling like change gears talk many different disembodied personalities day.

A friend college worked call center possibly long knew him. receiving orders mail order catalog selling outdoor gear, already basically hobby loved fish. great time, talking like-minded people entire shift. home small groups instead crowded non ventilated room others Well, college, entered one things booth..... identity stolen thousands dollars phone calls run name border town I've never life. 

But gave t-shirt press-on image john belushi animal house it, so..... Someone Facebook works hooters called Daddy Desantis :( truly inspires great distancing Probably 2x 3x adapt eat drink? Imagine fucking dead. Wahhhh bar. Fuck off. Floridian thing politician ever done 5% death rate common bandied forum. Again, I'm disputing you, I'm disputing assertion ""no evidence"". Even correlation (weak) evidence causation. cover mouth cough sneeze? masks reduce amount airborne particles. certain point science becomes common sense.  don‚Äôt need scientist tell wash hands take shit. hyperbole. old world ""endure"", changed. world always changes pandemics. changing now.

The pandemic last forever, changes permanent. way work, shop interact already changed, change probably back before. clear now. companies got money plan basically put money owners' pockets.

I checked companies local area got funds and, large, companies would expect huge impact social distancing. Basically, treasury got fleeced tune hundreds billions dollars. Except like 90%+ voters. Democrats Republicans care well-being lower class. outlier Democrats ones actually care. Overall, establishment Democrats bad Republicans CCCP cyrillic SSSR, USSR called russian Herman Cain said so! forgot thoughts. similar drop totally unrealistically. Q2, New Zealanders spent many weeks really strict lockdown (couldn't even get takeaway food). Now, lots Kiwis pockets full cash thanks unplanned saving spree. Lack testing botched public awareness campaign importance mask usage early pandemic main contributing factors. *""We lot weird gross shit* "" always part larger human experience. 

Since beginning time.

Its are, species. feel like go well   Irony cold mistress Man woulda thought China artful war pretty sure numbers quote quarter quarter (Q1 Q2) quite lot actually. 

http://www.scb.se/en/finding-statistics/statistics-by-subject-area/national-accounts/national-accounts/national-accounts-quarterly-and-annual-estimates/pong/statistical-news/national-accounts-second-quarter-2020/ CANT HEAR FREEDOM Yes, one worked much better. mean best. that's case leave anyway, firing means gets unemployment Jesus Christ Maybe Biden reinstate elected?  Canadian, think many Canadians going travel Florida year, even let border.

Those likely travel normal year also risk. see it. Look numbers then. decrease cases, patients ICU deaths speaks effectiveness measures. effect, numbers would increased. people desperately looking Swedens measure fail? near Alex Jones-level  People really poor countries actually less affected due young population. People crustal positions elderly get first. Let‚Äôs go trick r treating tour haunted houses!!!!! /s social distancing guidelines recommend that?

For example, ones limit restaurant capacity 25% spaced tables, meaning restaurant really afford bring back 5 servers, used staff 25. 80% us work. would probably cause us fail meet client's deadline, would put us work decided pull projects.

To update: went VP today Corp's Covid policy hand pointed 3 key parts, Social distancing, masks unable SD, policy ""Must"" adopted implemented.

Needless say go well.. basically told I'm nervous go home, Company Family bubble (150+ employees), 2 kinds people (people scared ones know recover) mask protects right tell others wear one.

but 30 mins training, class split proper social distancing happened day today!! even one top execs ask feeling better now, said ""It's manageable.""

I can't tell dug hole, got street cred boys floor. surprise surprise, took vow poverty. failed narrative sucks. need new playbook. Thanks really give fuck anymore. kill probably cause serious lasting damage. I'm rock bottom going another lockdown. What's fucking point implying beat wave 1  CCCP horrorshow. Sweden never closed borders never isolated never locked never shut schools never wore masks mandatory  Considering Russia alone 60k excess deaths year far, whilst 19k official deaths definitely are. even gonna mention less developed countries reporting deaths normal times quite unreliable. Holy fuck lost brain cells. Shut fuck Trump Capitalism. Pretty sure comments chain song lyrics various anti-war/anti-establishment songs. Mostly old people Canada, think us Canadians going stay home year thought seen every level petty, rude outright crazy customer interaction prior pandemic, turns people actually putting effort civil back then.

TBH, EVERYWHERE. People gong crazy due lockdowns. someone edge, (s)he would pushed edge... rude customer service bad doubt mental ""impact"" manifests way family street violence.

The health cost may well higher health cost Covid. Depends important know sure.

It possible could positive could negative. sounds situation, it‚Äôs pretty unlikely positive shit load Kiwi's spending international travel money domestic tourism help mitigate loss. Trump wins country gonna burn ground. trust numbers paying attention. maybe originated Africa Sweden never lockdown 100% time , open border open schools Racism reared ugly head America yet again. get credit effective response. ... *every day*.  Every single day, numbers line reasoning, 0.002% chance get infected die. 100 days, 0.2% duration. sound big, probably dangerous thing people exposed *every single day* point, even possibility dying car crash.

I'm telling people mad. say masks social distancing, i'm saying not. cases.

They closed restaurants. Denmark closed bars restaurants 22. Limited gatherings. That's people like.

Framing people selfish hate masks social distancing disingenuous. People angry lose jobs feel like can't enjoy lives.

I'm even speaking efficacy measures, i'm simply saying people want anymore. volunteers vaccine trials given placebo get vaccine first. called listening fucking health officials. thought dies, dies?

I requested ballots time August they‚Äôre still Good let scream, broken quarantine. countries would put jail. still evidence left starve death, sensationalised headlines. loving job this. wanna lay down. know fuck without making postabout right? Like leave?  purposes reporting statistics, CDC‚Äôs definition recovered still alive 30 days. necessarily mean lack symptoms. Sure, many people free symptoms within 10 days many others still struggling months later. Also, still know long term effects. ‚ÄúAs long you‚Äôre still productive literally cry day fucking care‚Äù

-Your boss probably Doesn‚Äôt help don‚Äôt really know anything number deaths. 

I haven‚Äôt heard single person‚Äôs name died UK. nurses stuff look sure aren‚Äôt given personal perspective. It‚Äôs number. arent burned out. cry essential jobs shitty. pandemic really showed company really feels health safety. give fuck. people started calling due covid, workload increased 10 fold people stayed work. safe say I'm actively looking another job. I‚Äôm graphic designer first part pandemic us working home. successful everything fine. However wanted bring us back office support sale staff doesn‚Äôt even come office. sit small office door closed 8 hours go home. Every morning contemplate excuse quit job can‚Äôt come work today. feel miserable lucky job time, it‚Äôs awful.  That's dont get like making profits ever least could cut hours schedule people dont work 3 people's jobs Maybe interested Russia largest country land size, borders largest country population? mention shares border dozens European countries. cases spiking Russia, could inferred outbreaks going happen countries well. I‚Äôm burned out, different way. amazing job, one expected work retired 30-40 years, I‚Äôm working dead end place half (less consider lost pension future raises) earning potential thanks COVID layoffs.

It literally hurts think aspects old job lost friends.

I don‚Äôt cry work, I‚Äôve come close. No, don‚Äôt go back bad behavior. Get revisionism, trying gloss - canceled.

Remind 3 months!  weigh it‚Äôs worth losing job over. It‚Äôs dumb source article  mean, NYC different position rest country.

The population NYC around 8,340,000.

And amount people died NYC 23,875.

If take estimated IFR 0.65%. means NYC 3,659,230 coronavirus cases. That's significant portion population. dont think city world high coronavirus percentage. That's literally 43% entire city covid.

And considering 420,000 left NYC went elsewhere pandemic started. Means percentage shoots 46% entire city covid. Far less people dying Mexico Panama country catch Sweden. Mexico Panama kinda much worse starting point showcases seperate issue.

Turns even tho dont cure know disease treat better. Sweden forced major outbreak knew nothing.  Credit Union teller here. hazard pay cut even though location shut multiple times Corona. Luckily never gotten it. Outside shutdowns we‚Äôve working full time+ since March 16th. make living wage IL. Yet ‚Äúessential‚Äù risk. hate capitalist shit.

TBH, doesn‚Äôt make sense cleveland could approaching zero cities surround not. Apparently Sweden seeing increases cases, levels seen months, leaders feel need keep restrictions place keep Covid19 getting hand. 


Seems 'Hurrrrr duuurrrr Reopen Fully, Restrictions, Herd Immunity!"" fools running around Reddit want news briefing Thursday, Prime Minister Stefan Lofven said Swedes become relaxed heeding anti-COVID-19 guidelines, plan lift ban visits elder care homes, said government would hesitate implement restrictions new cases continued blamed recent spike cases people letting guard down. said, ‚ÄúThe caution existed spring replaced hugs, parties,‚Äù many, attempt return ‚Äúnormal separate news conference Thursday, Sweden's state epidemiologist, Anders Tegnell, told reporters believed country seen rapid spread resurgence virus European countries seen restrictions implement left place. countries, like Spain, locked completely, said also possible Sweden could experience type surge He's protected media.

Just keep get can, overdoing meet ridiculous demands measurings new standard expectation.. youre fucking yourselves. people don‚Äôt keep productivity forced back ends. wanna stay home make sure prove you‚Äôre effective home you‚Äôll never see again. Sure, isolated territories island nations could avoid second wave happening all, case hard lockdown works great. Good you.

But that's realistic scenario countries porous borders lot domestic travel like US. People still dying covid (but hardly Sweden). Don‚Äôt care dying tomorrow month? Shit, told us masks bad go chinatown NYC. office was/is furious go remote first chance forced us back WRH option. used respect company know scum I'm first chance get. must made booboo somewhere. properly sealing it, properly washing hands taking off, rubbing eyes, touching face. got flu surface since influenza thats lives surfaces 3 days. kids back school, they're really well right now.

Shoot, exactly thinkg wtf Yeah, RI one bad school, Providence College, that‚Äôs caused entire state‚Äôs inhabitants quarantined Northeast states.

Currently Providence College put students lockdown: on-campus stay campus dorms, off-campus stay apts; one in-person classes. 

Providence College (belatedly) hired private security patrol off-campus neighborhood quell partying. (Note colleges Boston start, therefore negligible problems.)

Providence College notorious ‚Äúparty school‚Äù long history zero respect surrounding neighborhood inhabitants.

I think city state fine college. think none known party schools ever allowed students back person pandemic. Interesting. bad sale exploring ideas. lot viruses lipid bilayer use soap water breaks layer many dont survive handwashing. saw article saying handwashing masks dont work.

Answer question:

Once get covid vaccine, still keep indoor dining, bars, large gatherings closed? Belgium, amount people admitted hospitals march amount dead lot lower... 2 weeks, knows. name country increased testing  probably hemorrhoids. doctor verify minutes, see one case isn't. There. *perfect* argument ""new COVID mutation bypass hand-washing mask-wearing"" Telegraph article skeptic ""friends"" keep showing me! Fucking idiots. board member fuck wad. mean CFR lower previous peak, IFR. testing previous peak.

Thanks Capitalism. Heparin heavy lifting. broward believe using ivermectin. Herd immunity 2020!!!!!! companies forced go bankrupt. can't pay bills tough shit. stupid hell seeing companies get bailed over. American, hell would care US‚Äôs figures!? proving point quite succinctly. recognize comment incorrect? Younger people lower risk COVID-19 influenza. companies layoffs implemented paycuts fined penalized ways. 

If didn‚Äôt actually stop paying employees layoffs - huge growth like Walmart‚Äôs Amazons also fined penalized. wonder receiving PPP actually required submit payroll first place. 

If article accurate funds actually walled pay employees companies paid dividends legally funds, don‚Äôt see issue. see issue solid propaganda clickbait trying stir pot make us angrier though gotta get stronger microorganisms, can‚Äôt let dictate lives! 

You talk like intimidate virus. Like somehow cares sticking tough... somehow, make less contagious sheer force will. 

That said, clumsy way say ""We need vaccine, already."" I'd board. repost? Unpopular post incoming.

Per article:

* PPP loan recipients weren‚Äôt prohibited paying investors funds, long PPP funds kept separate.*

So direct use funds pay shareholder. saying didn‚Äôt happen least prohibition it.

 there‚Äôs different problem:

You‚Äôre hurting enough take PPP loan yet enough cash pay shareholders?

In mind worse. taking money offset payroll expenses pay shareholders reality, shareholders accept risk loss owning equity stake. 

That stock price dividend payouts must remain intact severe economic downturn totally ass-backwards. 

But that‚Äôs economic business model currently have. Yeah... people threatened teacher go back school causing either mass retirements(anecdote-teachers work well past retirement least really good ones I‚Äôve known) schools close back immediately? Like, bright ideas people have? wont work. Europe shut spring dealing another massive wave. Unless plan keep people welded house another year, shutdowns help way. destroy economy 2008, US government demanded equity types BS loans. time pure unadulterated kleptocratic theft. sound like good friend. That's heartbreaking, think maybe letting know joking would good move friendship? I'm sure that'd tough work life.. gosh see worldometers graph case count today 5-6 times previous peak fatality rate still 1/10th previous peak. lag cases deaths trend started nearly two months ago.

Hospitalizations indicator meantime also far lower peak. often reported ""one month high hospitalizations"" ""hospitalizations increased"" report small fraction were.

The explanation pretty clear, testing larger segments population rate illness death drops exponentially younger are. got staff member home. Read. Lots people acting like I'm at. dont get it. tipped double usual first haircut. bought lip gloss (they sell cosmetics too). Even though I'm wearing mask smears. nice neutral color Zoom meetings. Looks polished professional, like I'm trying hard. problem were/are still writing laws distribution happened. Canadian here.

We sales tax called GST. applies goods flat rate. apply basic things like food rent. Also, depending income get cheque cut monthly federal government portion expected GST expenses. low enough income, actually likely spend GST.

Additionally, carbon tax applies goods. Canadians get essentially rebate income tax collected carbon tax. rebate given beginning year expected expenses. Thus advantages low-carbon low-income people most.

Though defacto VAT, essentially thing. plenty ways continue expanding systems none regressive manner raises funding government well curbing consumption carbon-intense products. also simple administrate expand already infrastructure setup. would massively favour expanding systems. plans trashed parties weren‚Äôt good plans begin with. Unfortunately actually quite possible. Whenever someone asks exactly stupid one person be, direct comment. Takeout fine, food probably next risk transmission. wash hands touching boxes/containers picking up. think care attention Reddit funny. everything need.  called geometric growth. People cant add much less figure natural log. silver bullet what? 

Ending pandemic? I‚Äôd say so.

Eliminating covid19? I‚Äôd say no. That‚Äôs isolate people will. Wait, shitty companies shitty things? Get fuck outta here. Oh definitely. VAT-only taxation proposed whacky extremists afaik. Also work call center, us move work home immediately march. literally ""hey pack pc/monitor/keyboard/mouse car go home"" getting used working pandemic hurricane obliterated job hometown. rough fucking year. Whataboutism defense leader indefendable.

My governor interpreter every press conference since beginning everyone else's. Looks like cases began increasing somewhere around mid late July, spiking happening mid-August, around 5 weeks ago. spike deaths. Got another explanation?

I mean, hard draw statistically significant conclusions small state like ND, certainly uptick deaths lately looking average daily deaths.

They went 7-day average 1 death day consistently April August 2 early September 3 since Mid-September.  curiosity, know? Could tumors potentially take years develop? southern hemisphere mild flu season year due measures? Let's sue source entire problem: GOP. left enough centrist stand chance, especially super-polarized election draws closer. cried work years pandemic. cry work years pandemic.
Life garbage. Netherlands 1.75x population. Still bad death per capita, lower Sweden. Belgium would better example case course not, clearly smart person alive That's literally companies receive money government.

Every. Single. Time. really California University *Student*, football player. really matter, freed would payroll things, like places sin taxes pay Schools, happen cut schools sin taxes brought in. NZ Sweden borders open everyone Inside Schengen area (or EU/EEA, sure right now)

To fair neighbors, Norway never official LOCKDOWN either. Restrictions, stricter Swedens lockdown, lot stricter Swedens. refuse foreigners enter quite time tho, deported people caught here, Americans, Chinese, germans etc, even Swedes allowed enter, turned back border. but, GOP moral party, follow bible! can't abortions even mothers life risk send kids school COVID save economy! they? Let‚Äôs get real info there. true unfortunately. people moved trying live lives waiting news say over. Whereas sub overflowing anxious, trolls hermits. Nah, going dismiss unless someone complete isolation licks frozen food package smeared Covid tests positive. proven, evidence far. evidence fomite infections 100 viruses since hundred years. I‚Äôm taking anything context. Seriously, reading . asked directly lied. said masks don‚Äôt work. quoted response . said didn‚Äôt want people rushing masks healthcare workers would them. direct quote. isn‚Äôt debate. lied. admitted it. context. It‚Äôs mouth. gaslighting now? 

I‚Äôll quote again. Read show says said thought didn‚Äôt work. (Hint doesn‚Äôt.)

Now Fauci admitted reason Americans initially discouraged using shortage, Adams acknowledged second part February tweet. 

‚ÄúWe concerned public health community, many people saying this, concerned time personal protective equipment, including N95 masks surgical masks, short supply,‚Äù Fauci told Street. ""We wanted make sure people, namely, healthcare workers, brave enough put harm's way take care people know infected coronavirus, danger getting infected. want without equipment needed."" ""Herd mentality"" working think different working definitions ""normal"" ""arbitrary"".  

Cafes, bars, restaurants schools open almost danger virus exposure.  team stranded Korea though.  guess worse places right now. whole read sad one.  Tracey Tobin works pharmacy technician Walgreens outside Boston, Massachusetts. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve worked 10- 13-hour shifts without breaks called names person called drug manufacturers [cut making medicine. I‚Äôm tired burned still making job every day come home mom teacher. It‚Äôs stressful exhausting,‚Äù said Tobin. 

And regular meds (vs. new ones injury illness), patient responsibility refill early can.  Though know insurance limits and/or finances make tough. Part system broken. need fix it.  


Even though try keep top supply meds take, still go back next day inhaler refill stock. pharmacist's fault. since refill soon can, inhaler. extent can, let meds get day so. Unfortunately, people choice due finances insurance, anyone keep least 2 weeks supply meds.   like parties really care citizens care donors asses. Stop voting Democrats Republicans. One group pieces shit assholes group assholes hypocrites/opportunists paid lose. Virginia data BTW, Democratic party outwardly loudly made effort stop Trump Tax happening. guess what, surprise MF! Senate voted push through! seriously, point? Fuck DJT enablers (conservatives &amp; GOP) band played on. Inbound call center. Salary/commission. Id call selling account reps. don‚Äôt think anyone going outlaw wearing masks.

You post vaccine state So? Look then. Lead example provide source settles question all.

 Bear mind entertaining irrelevant tangent went giving rubbish strawman argument. look us plain decency. Where's source? Well stimulus payments direct payments individuals. PPP loans provide small businesses money could pay employees time basically shut down. makes sense, bigger one time payment people retaining jobs companies didn‚Äôt lay fold completely? course abused also critical MANY companies doesn‚Äôt enrage people won‚Äôt see headlines. Oh yeah, island 5 million people infection vector origin pandemic couple billion people.

Oh btw, new zealand never confirmed frozen food vector, speculation without definitive evidence complicated ridiculous. know true number NYC, argument ""NYC one lowest nation"" easily debunked since wont count everyone else. think is? around US average, hide it? issues information needing lawsuit try get? I've shown one nursing home state reported 4 21 reality. t's hard think pretty simply sending sick people back place full vulnerable people great idea. know general public worse NYC early treatments great yet, ventilators harm good, NYC LTC number could worse 2x. 

The watchdog number counts vacancies, including people left states home isolate, anecdotally, seemed pretty common people realized nursing homes turning death traps. high end, unless think people still occupying nursing homes secretly dead. know NH 80% LTC states high. Could many factors it. knowing whole thing extremely complex take years answer shows ignorance.

We know nursing home decision increased aggregate mortality high end estimate brings NY line average. simple arithmetic. There's already protest planned London weekend. anti mask types flooding public transport network hotboxing various shops trains potentially wirh covid. end luxurious resort? Oh wait mean white collar prison. Theft theft white collar theft treated differently kinds theft. Masks cure, help little. case numbers rising masks, would likely rising without them. print more! even better, make masks official currency, plenty now. spam letters letting know audited preserve records.

If takes years, takes years. ""If poor, something that.""


Are listening yourself?


If ever $50 set aside, actually know like poor. Poor people poor ""consumer debt"". homeless 3 years kicked 17. got first pair socks since turning 17 21, literally living dollar day while, whoever would let sleep couch. no, people dont that. person told little life, said, ""You move new place.""


Do know expensive move? truck, rent one, average, $150. Then, good credit live place high enough rent safe, make enough money able pay rent. Then, deposit worth first last month's rent, literally thousands dollars, $50 set aside. 


And no, people *not* family stay keep kids. Either lot family, family *also working* cannot afford take care children. make 40k year I'm supporting paying SO's bills he's school right now, savings. *don't* 3 kids husband support I'm still living very, modestly.



Again, actually poor (you're - statistically impossible pay college right working one job unless either making waaaaay minimum wage, receiving rental assistance / allowance parents, going community College), please give advice poor. unhelpful touch.  maddening thing even New Zealand isn‚Äôt testing cold storage workers. inexplicable reason refuse take serious possibility.  much longer.  Depending November 3rd goes may see history making. can't/won't teach kids home, who's going teachers school get sick quit rather get sick? detained probably around covid death patients due contact tracing Yeah, long reasonably large payroll expenses really matter.

2) Sure, nobody wants complex rules paperwork. actually Sweden asked regional travel rules instead national rules first place.

3) Like Nordic countries did.

That mean influenza amusing afterthought something slept on, coronaviruses especially deadly fearsome. COVID-19 happens novel, killing people largely via aggressive immune over-reaction. suppression case counts Florida [seems yeah. yea said asymptomatic spreaders get tested..then reversed decision 
I going post that. weird coincidence report comes day story. Lmao good luck‚Äî last serious white collar crime case America like 20 years ago. Tegnells approval numbers anything go Swedes indeed need good smack. I'm downvoting chances fellow Sweets.

Why Danish strategy failing? 

Because like every country increasing new cases? twice many new daily cases Sweden, testing five times more?

Our average last two weeks 43.5 cases per 100k, middle Europe certainly one worst.

Nobody getting desperate, annoyed new cases increasing again. One must look historic precedent:

Instead usual circuitous workarounds, time around republicans opportunity give rich money directly Treasury simply writing checks them.

Shame.  Florida still wave 1 stopped testing people. Hey sorry forgot sub made post. clarification, thought Canadian sub venting situation since large cases fairly low enough. situation US pretty terrible feel comfortable everyday business.

I really sympathize reasoning. Personally though seen though people inherently selfish. People whatever hell wanted last months simply cannot function living like without rules place. personally issue me, own. least many people already mental torture subjegate be, seems one trying stay locked little pleasures like. I'm saying go go life like - least seeing family, friends things like hobbies totally sacrificied ""greater good"". Especially system place likely create way vectors ever encourage everything open.

This coming someone forced go back work watch multiple ppl whatever want - flying weddings, attending parties, opening businesses, etc still quarantine mode. I'm introvert issues lockdown honestly (so minority) even equivalent mental torture knowing everything large majority people aren't. felt way extrapolate many extroverts probably totally lost cannot function quarentine mode.

For reason think half assed corona response encourage busisnesses open, schools open, still expect people lockdown mode life. personally plan wear mask anytime im indoor space pick choose outtings based passionate feel (so probably movie theatres, open meeting close friends families occasional gym outtings biggest passion pre lockdown open). coronavirus situation convinced rellying individuals act accordingly blaming work simply work. unsafe - rules place lock down. end day people inherently selfish unfortunately.

I'm human like everyone else. forced work kinda lost months things expose people mental health. terrified virus like everyone else truly feel get it, statistically probably work interaction anyway even PPE. end day go work - sustain life fund things love. think makes fundamentally hard things love open legally forced work. statistics did: 

Currently death rate 3% infected USA like said. currently 40k 300 million getting infected daily USA...lets make times 5 conservative 200k 300 million getting infected daily...so that's .06 % chance get infected. get infected die 3% times .06% equals .002 %.. .002% percent chance get coronavirus die US. Assuming catch (big assumption), there's masks plane, negative test reenter Mass, think populace ok. Would nice job first place. entire company imploded covid. fucking great getting takeout less safe vaccines Florida‚Äôs numbers strange. death rate still high case counts low, suggesting suppression case counts. don‚Äôt think go well. people left want people right die governor dipshit. thats insane. sent back work frontline.

I mean essential workers poor barely getting by? I't simple. Corona spreading masks worn. spread places (and probably never will) house family friends work wear it.

Now people make argument masks virus would spread even faster, might might true. would good know actual difference would be, would difficult calculate. Nope, pointing obvious anyone else reads comment thread. I‚Äôll send expenses way think that, good point Naturally lol. Thirded! something pedo cunt yeah he's good  mask mandate state revenue? lockdown. making sure people wear masks. trying troll me.  I'm thinking reason Covid South America paid Catholic Church lots money escape prosecution Europe.

Old habits die hard. voting day, cough cough tried put clause stimulus package prevent this, left passed... observations consistent suggestions mask wearing help mitigating pandemics associated respiratory disease.¬†

You also used science try prove wrong wtf happening right now.

Who fuck think gathers stats misunderstand use fights like this? Scientists. Wave terminology stupid honestly, disease arrives, always there.

There's dipsh\*t sheriff actually allow anyone file police report unless remove mask... cops required do. It‚Äôs sad much population brain washes believing gop good choice them. guns, abortion, funding programs keep minorities worse better improving situation along millions others.

If like attitude, like questioned pay, even protected class fire right way challenge it. jobs though pile responsibilities quit get fired avoid paying ridiculously small amount unemployment. know fact I'm victim wage theft can't fight without losing job can't get evidence prove due store sets get reduced minimum wage pay.

Don't ever ask American scared lose jobs, cause unlike *really* get choice if, do. Captain jack kevorkian person's user name. Definitely fits response imagine troll learns Europe obsessed masks, he/she would go crazy. mention fucking hours... paramedic would love 9-5. sleep schedule absolutely destroyed. illegal okay taking risk might infect people? know do, argument first place. Shots vodka effective   Exactly like sales tax, lol. False positives happen time. bad still quarantine better safe sorry. positive CT initially part diagnostic criteria COVID-19. course got control that's obviously longer feasible. Ready 4 exactly? subjective. lot EU begin 6. Ok point Nauvut, 0 case. 0 cases currently, virus hit Nanuvt all. repeated success?

The problem rest world plugged global supply chains basic essentials. efficent point entry landborder, spread across country. makes controlling entry virus difficult. shipping Australia New Zealand happens ports, contain spread.

Take Canada, headed winter months, food comes US Mexico. try restrict entry ports Vancouver, Montreal, Toronto, Halifax. interior provinces Alberta, Saskatchewan) end going hungry. large parts Ontario, Quebec.

Why becuase time food gets them, spoiled. let truckers cross Canada country, means potentially imported cases US them. *Eventually, Americans develop immunity exposure vaccination*

The sane people arguing exposure less risk populations months shouted charlatans.

We'd done had, know, copied behavior communist dictatorship concentration camps Muslims. Yes. Definitely 0 people arrested exactly shell companies committing fraud make fake payroll...oh wait there's 36 cases since start August. that's caught. car one illegal. example one mega group could get multiple loans. one illegal. shady. Yeah gonna me, dawg. possible kissing symptomatic person contaminated? fairness fair group Florida together. Like elections South Florida, Orlando Tallahassee [voted pretty hard Dem candidate. get ever slightly outvoted rural areas every time.

De Santis .4% 32,000 votes. There's strong amount people hate DeathSantis much rest US mom fat! Lol Read this. Even worst case scenario scientists predicting, within 2-3 years less back normal, hopefully couple societal benefits (such working home year... fuck. timeline true I‚Äôd rather infected get with. Exactly this. restrictions? Yeah, fuck trying stay close child. I‚Äôm real dipshit, huh? Simplistically: rich political action money complain continuously. 
Whereas common folk complain sometimes live lives rest time. Wait costs $150 get PCR test? i.e. antibody test? Uhm.... making walled Jewish ghetto ‚Äúsolve problem‚Äù upvoted?

Guys? never got dime hoping funds keep business open. wrong. Many essential workers frequently exposed population large.  wait train crash consider changing course. tested positive ONCE. Governor said need light touch government.

Until hundreds die nothing. Wonderful. surprised. one weaknesses contact tracing, relies people truthful. that‚Äôs lockdown New Zealand Germany ... experienced ""Don't gather. also there's 2 cafeterias campus paid us $6,000 mandatory meal plan every undergrad campus gather eat."" say, AFAIK he's least allowing local governments impose restrictions, there's that. point, state require masks irresponsible. Yes short time created incredible shareholder value. Reported deaths. Plenty countries (Iran, Russia...) simply report deaths. begging lied to. Nuts.

Trump lied, believe it, pathetic. agree think places world deal actual crisis regular sometimes vigilant comes fighting disease. could really go either way possible live area there's lots disease used disrupting life, wearing mask maybe going concert indoors seem like big price pay. 

I also feeling people spend lot time outdoors places Africa, areas developed maybe people go outside cooler breeze instead staying inside ac. hope so, too. Lets stay sane disciplined! Shortsighted, no? Umm, vast conspiracy mentioned everyone media intentionally overstating risk covid, trick voters voting mail order take advantage changes post office scare people believing administration trying suppress vote slowing mail. Reads like rant someone standing front cork board covered newspaper clippings scribbles post notes. news worthy. Every single medical test ever used currently existence sensitivity specificity rate, guaranteed FP FN. good ask ""when return normal"". answer question, say, *never*. Instead, ask ""how make sure keep others safe new normal?""

Let's face it: return ""old normal"". *World Health Organization* said so. I'm fairly surprised taken long us realize this; *expected* daily life change long-term catastrophe, COVID-19 pandemic? words Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, U.S. House candidate: need folks realize there‚Äôs going back brunch. whole new world build. cannot accept going back way things were... must deliver transformative, material change. 

If socially distance wear masks rest lives, should. Otherwise, we're putting health safety others jeopardy best, breaking law worst. something health experts around world agree on, agree, ignoring science favor politics. point time, I'm sure certain whether died abundance licorice additive mixed it. entirety Vietnam like 1069 cases total lol. North Dakota 19451 far. people forced live places social distancing nearly impossible. So, poor ghetto, yes. poor mobile home country wait. China CDC recommend mass-vaccination country level community transmission little kind read as, ""the herd mentality live work/slave"". exact consequences seeing now. Lol no. Human rights transcend culture. Pretty convenient say though. want waste money getting back negative tests lol. lie, everyone contact would forced quarantine. dishonesty seems like inevitable result policy tbh It‚Äôs probably least 60% immunity achieve herd immunity, still susceptibility another wave. seem know Sweden done. all. Social distancing practiced since start, quite consistent. High schools university close months. recommendations restrictions mandated law, people followed them. community thinks risk low probably higher ever.

Hey, President said ""hardly affects anyone""! Dig deep, Dig often. probably wont no, anything would help. vaccines arent fucked rushed production(not anti-vaxxer, considered break neck speed disregard testing get vaccine out).
Christ, Im looking forward rest life. Why? probbably reached one million awhile ago, deaths dramatically undercounted Russia, USA, India, many places. Yeah that‚Äôs I‚Äôm bashing people different countries, sure bashing Americans. 1a doesn‚Äôt mean keep mouth shut people call countrymen stupid racists. I‚Äôm pro 1a btw never even brought freedom speech... Every positive case rapid test also tested PCR afterwards money needs repaid criminal charges filed fraud.

I think mean ""and"" ""or"" determines who's troll amount downvotes?

Oh honey, Reddit long, you? Lol.

Also, I'm guy, think bit confused. Pay attention now. Thanks Facebook Prisons crowded dorms essentially. takes one person floor/block infect everyone. even know I've absent. sadly Dr office close noon Fridays I'm work Monday too.


See selfish acts others contributing economic hurt additional burden others? enough sub teachers available, especially position. idea really level instruction students may getting teacher assistant covering class. 

I worry it, really beyond control. 

:( poor correlates strongly job puts high risk right enjoy trump   many people die percentage One study‚Äôs authors, University Hong Kong public health professor Ben Cowling, told PolitiFact claim amounts ""incorrect interpretation"" study, ""confusing absence evidence evidence absence.""

Literally author study cited said spreading bullshit. need internship, get one paid 15 bucks hour One study‚Äôs authors, University Hong Kong public health professor Ben Cowling, told PolitiFact claim amounts ""incorrect interpretation"" study, ""confusing absence evidence evidence absence.""

Literally author study cited said spreading bullshit. presidential them... Put jail set precedent One study‚Äôs authors, University Hong Kong public health professor Ben Cowling, told PolitiFact claim amounts ""incorrect interpretation"" study, ""confusing absence evidence evidence absence.""

Literally author study cited said spreading bullshit. thought so, get better material they? 6 feet social distancing rule based fact US CDC believe spread covid aerosol unlikely. currently, suspicions covid spread air. US CDC do? Announce covid airborne get rid 6 feet rule? keep 6 feet rule?

Well, read article (couldn't find, sorry, weekend now, getting lazy), Chinese contact tracing teams found biggest distance infection proven 7m, safe side, think advocate that. However 6 feet distance already considerably reduces risks, maintaining 7m distance everyone times hardly practical, accept ""Meh, good People provinces Chinese citizens.

That hardly argument maintaining effective many countries implemented quarantines. countries banned foreigners leaving country?

Spain example. (Hungary) also short period one allowed cross border reason Instead, better strategy ban, controlled evacuation.

Why both? ROC banned commercial flights December, said, still evacuated citizens PRC orderly fashion blaming US government essentially thing?

Have read comments? course, US fucked badly even funny, earlier incompetence cover-up attempts PRC pale So, reiterate, plenty decisions blamed for, no, done job well. better job US government, yes, incredibly low bar.

How *not* blaming US government? fact saying much worse job WHO. argument regardless still horrible job compared supposed do. close false positive rate... Well nearly many üçäsupporters california (4.483m) florida (4.617m) texas (4.685m). Even left outnumbers right 2 1 california still lot deniers hoaxers running around messing everyone else.

To clear, saying absolutely üçä supporters deniers/hoaxers. there‚Äôs significant overlap. hear you, good points. think ground level decisions though much emotionally driven either side spectrum still feel like health officials great commuicators, know it‚Äôs hard pandemic example flatten curve, many people thought ‚Äúok know what‚Äù.

The initial flatten curve message don‚Äôt overwhelm hospitals systems, never overwhelmed live (Bay Area) would result less cases less once.

What missing part explanation flattening curve still long long way go, people thought finish line goal posts moved. argue finer points looking comments thread essentially agree everything messaging good.

For example, called months ago need proactive comms talking vaccine development works, safety trials work, corners cut. Guess what? percent people said take one fallen dramatically, forced reactive communication never effective. Awesome beautiful magnificent tremendous know say samething car accidents then..what counted deaths per day like covid.. surveillance video California jail LA county shows inmates deliberately trying infect Covid article changes prison release policy regards Covid. said, it‚Äôs blatantly obvious Covid spread prisons cruise ships. won‚Äôt though..And think know why.. Two days old account interests discouraging people wearing masks encouraging herd immunity. lol Look post history... purely, past two days, post post junk re: masks/herds sign human kind hobbies interests. Depends made right connections. Also depends looking job piece paper adequate get past gate keepers. Absolutely. one pretend know well handle vehicle I've drinks. want drink drive, that's call. older large truck, stay home. people driving know risks associated driving, stop drinking others afraid. I'm Brooklyn. lived 15 years Midwood 6 months Gravesend. I'm basically Ocean Parkway cluster. Orthodox Jewish people Russians wearing masks. family included. think mask wearing sort propaganda meant separate people make everyone afraid other. is... exactly predicted would happen. never forget sight fuckers grocery store mid-March carts piled brim toilet paper. wont get first vaccine trust first rendition anything.

Is good person, saying use poor lab rats? bought 3 years worth info first came April, safe. Who's ready repeat 2020! Yeah! ball drops times square watching zoom say ""HAHA 2020 ONE TIME!""

who's me?! unironically  dont mean all. go back obliviousness before. Actually think viral load lower patients due mask use. breath much less virus wearing mask. People wearing masks beginning pandemic. Yeah...... Numbers china......totally legit /s Keep based DeSantis. Every day Florida goes hospitals capacity death rate well northeast states fills subreddit rage. Obviously missing school better spreading COVID, saying it‚Äôs ‚Äújust kindergarten‚Äù downplays importance one vital years child‚Äôs education insulting teach kindergarten. end point vaccinating away disease become consistent plague species

And many decades take? flu vaccines still kills hundreds thousands per year. polio; vaccine miracle panacea.

Again, really seem advocating indefinite/semi-permanent restrictions. need restrictions also extremely harmful economic physical health people them. ""Technically legal"" going seen ""just following orders"" 21st century. excuse let people partaking immoral often downright evil behavior justify actions. example gravity flawed force nature. 

No, not. said something hurdle. made assumptions attacked strawman. 

And end the, matter. live US, must pay taxes USD, even paid crypto. think solution asking permission, solution, learned economics participating markets thinking things through. Sorry meet criteria validity.

That's like saying learned English medicine participating living thinking things through. No, meet criteria anything all. basically saying much read basic studies economic theories match critical eye.

Also, inflation caused mismatch currency's purchasing power perceived purchasing power. case nobody trusts cryptocurrency spend one two places. It‚Äôs going away cause people like keep shit like this. girl white dress gots tig ol bitties heard sequel finished anywhere late 2021 late 2022 delayed? u ? know ""YouTube dating coach"" guy lives calls people wear masks sheep. No, false negatives happen time . False
positives rare happen. 12 years old? hivemind sub become anti-lockdown anti-social distancing? started coming recently changed much back March. March people taking 110% seriously. sounds like y'all want end go back real life (which necessarily blame for). happened? won‚Äôt end well Murderous fool. ""How dare state reopen demonstrate hospitals stay capacity case numbers rise slightly without government forcing businesses shut down. must shame them!"" - /r/coronavirus nutshell see problem. can't wear mask? prevent wearing one Aha ‚ÄúCitizen*ry*‚Äù

Not ‚ÄúCitizen‚Äù. Kids ditch anyway, year total trash heap all. See ardern fucked whole country No, yes Good public policy works Last paragraph bit vague. expand would allocate tax funds help struggling families? show *Contagion* sequel? Kids learn count preschool. work childcare talking numbers counting literally starts infancy. kindergarten kids learn basic addition subtraction. understand position, takes **suggestion** something **might** produce result convince something is, fact, causing said result.

Watching coronavirus news cycle like watching ping pong match standard evidence low. Right now, pretty much everything know strong suggestion susceptible revision tomorrow. No, considering much Cuomo fucked up. many academics seemingly disconnected everyday society. baffles me. people step outside homes talk others? Even legitimately thinks right way go things, he'd spent couple minutes talking people street this, he'd realize absurd sounds. Hahahahaa.  

Do stand up, what? Good, people enough info point make decisions \*slow clap\* Yes ? Sinopharm one also old school inactivated. Really guy suggested VAT Tax: ‚ÄúFurs, yachts, super cars, know, *luxury goods*.‚Äù

You: ‚ÄúPhOnESs.‚Äù want guy but......since schools reopened, cases rising. Mayyyyyyyyybe could link? probably dumb question but... waiting period suspect exposed could test positive? e.g. potentially exposed Thursday, contract virus would test Friday come positive? 3 year old skipping preschool year 6 year old grade 1 12 kids. far good! Great üëç figure, energy spent ‚Äútrying go back normal‚Äù could better served adapting moment, coming new strategies, new innovations, etc etc...i can‚Äôt think time history humans successfully able return past-tense form life big event threw complications way

frankly, people want ride life, give means so. i‚Äôm tired getting pulled people scared/refuse change, try new ideas, work got hopes tomorrow better it. there‚Äôs enough shit struggle get deal already ROFL ü§£ negatively impact productivity? politicians worried blood hands? ""Uber cautious""? 
Perhaps California state level National level politicians. Trump could give shit 200 thousand + dead people half legislature(the fucking republicans) care keeping power people supposed serving.... Love üòç  PPP great theory.. provision company lose net income due covid qualify. 
Or company makes +$100million year lost 1 million revenue- need PPP loan several millions? Can't ceo take pay cut? companies crash 1% decrease revenue..

Don't get wrong- many places took PPP loans needed it. However, fuckloads businesses, many lost revenue may even done better previous years. deserve it, net profit stay afloat owners receive $$$ PPP loans distributions- tax free!

Lawmakers understand taxes. many loopholes lack ovlf oversight PPP. Taxpayers got hosed. hope successful matter stand decision. That's interesting. recently figured towns county would add it. helps terms understanding scope all. Whats sorta interesting links Russian Flu coronavirus one currently cold causing coronaviruses humans seems split bovine coronaviruses 19th century.

Basically theory basically ancestors virus. true may indicate Covid never go away may become less deadly end normal cold virus.

Or never gets.less deadly cause thing suprised us far.  Really? Yes? never responded like Correlation equal causation LMAO word ‚Äúno‚Äù confusing? illiterate? government handouts work. yours? almost surely case US well, many areas. US, people often talk we're ""second wave"", and/or July spike far worse March one baseline seems never fall low April/May cause concern. reality, basically testing (relative recently) times. Deaths, hospitalizations, percent positive time indicate true spread virus far, far, far worse indicated daily case count. July, hitting 70k cases day worst point, testing literally 5 times much April peak. admission lying?

BTW love keeping buried dead threads Vatican owns unimaginable riches: plunder, art, tithes, etc. Pope lead example liquidating wealth giving (and vaccines) poor.

Funny never gets around it, eh? Texas literally went 25% 50% 75% restaurant capacity trend curve curve kept trending down. yes ? long society virtue ascribed wealth, wealth concentrated hands increasingly small class people, stay solvent? incredible social conditioning lead us believe, even evidence contrary set right eyes... DeSantis sees reason asymptomatics quarantine tested Small businesses lobbyists pay for. What's point lobbyist, use them. /s sure mean by

‚ÄúNo tourism‚Äù? doctor nurse Florida, even bother anymore, get Gov.

SMH. Anyone go post history see harassing trolling weeks covid. ask wear mask hut can‚Äôt profit people wearing mask? Sounds reasonable Billionaires millionaires find many loopholes no, they‚Äôre not. Close loopholes make everyone pay fair share. 

It‚Äôs like isn‚Äôt common knowledge. love know look facebook insinuate still use insult me

man website fucking wash, bad facebook honestly right Realised last month. I‚Äôve got 2 year old hasn‚Äôt seen snow yet. used quite snow days young. Ahh yes, ignorant moron. China's current leading candidate CoronaVac, based de-actived (killed) actual Covid virus. China seem favour older vaccine production technologies, contrast West's mRNA vaccines (Moderna) spike graft vaccines based newer technology (Oxford). certainly advantages using older technology, longer research history, need deep cold storage like mRNA ones, means distributed easily Africa India. assume China going vaccine diplomacy. Iran-tier stuff, come US era Trump.

There always racists conspiracy theorists America. Blaming particular president letting American people hook. truth many (not all) Americans racists bigots. 

If cannot even admit American people problem, hope solve problem? That's argument CCP makes two-party system. must loving this. I'm going bedazzle vaccine. one's buying 20 packs vitamin one time. Relax reason postpone! postpone progression

AKA ""flattening curve"" exactly goal along. course can't eliminate virus, slow spread buy time work done vaccine. It‚Äôs alright. Look curve tests done. decline matching positive result's curve. BS unless exclusively individual stocks gambling fund managers choose play pooled money

A.) really call passive index funds ""playing""

B.) Even invested actively managed funds, that's still really gambling pejorative sense. Otherwise 401ks make sense , yesterday  Nah real future we're gonna crop failures water shortages sweaty balls perpetuity Sorry you‚Äôre deal this. I‚Äôm sorry many careless people like fellow admits selfish cost risking people‚Äôs lives. two migrants Ruili count local cases? know got virus outside country also come recognized port entry complete quarantine. far I'm concerned, walking around community undetected infection, count ""community infection"" tallying purposes. 2 kids. Under-reporting pervasive Indian media. Infections, deaths, job losses. Everything underreported. Wow. CEO truly dick! 

I see cashiers Target wiping conveyer belt drying it. don‚Äôt heart tell they‚Äôre useless. surface remain wet (with disinfectant) least 20 seconds order destroy potential pathogens given surface. Drying right away defeats purpose. :\ repeat Sweden without universal health care. get numbers slightly worse. thankful

I really understand people call ""propaganda"" even post stuff like this.

That's amazing, say many Americans lost ability think without politics mind death rate seem high country presumably under-reporting cases. decided use editorial changes add ""left starve death""

Nice. I'm ICU nurse. would rather done something else. see people working normal jobs feel jealous. Getting paid deal people's literal piss shit sounds amazing right now. wore kf94 diligently sick flu. Waiting test Vr pretty cool. see friends faces feels like somewhere instead staring screen. Good poker watching sports movie. son spectrum. thought Disney terrifies him. wonder Disney lovers want go them, child? chaos Disney lot anyone spectrum.

Just thought. Yeah very, privileged post. Well, you‚Äôre union, that‚Äôs need justify to. one? 

Where work, unspoken truth talking forming union one way ticket unemployment line. Ha, Europe even vaccine phase 3 trial besides Oxford's candidate

That's true. BioNTech European phase three trial. Pfizer vaccine. partnership Pfizer German company BioNTech. Dude know. finished school back April started making lowest amount company since job experience yet. wish could quit, phlebotomist job get would same. sign went back school. agree unethical, hear happening here, over. family works different hospital they've said thing. awful. don‚Äôt people read articles see wasn‚Äôt amusement park... I‚Äôm starting think call call centers give someone talk besides job...

Like call say ‚Äúyeah I‚Äôm customer wanted hear plans weekend‚Äù Especially pandemic dealing jerks whiners. 

From perspective, seems pandemic brings true character person. Unfortunately, instead supportive, many choose selfish. :( Nothing healthy People also suffer longterm effects think mean *sympathy*, acknowledging understanding someone's distress - feeling *for* someone.

*Empathy* feeling *with* someone. imagine people get wrecked empathetic day call center job.

It's also related sociopathy, here's [6 minute video Dr. K talking 

Another, in-depth video, regarding [sociopathy ""thick skin"" Dr. K Kitboga guy scams scammers full-time stream talks *ton* shady people, everyday. develop thick skin, too, would otherwise get him. real benefits? less deaths? Look Sweden's massive death count compared neighboring countries? isolating, putting everybody else risk.

Nobody gives damn hurt yourself. hurting others negligence illegal reason, that's advocating think governments ""free world"" held accountable? Oh please article literally says follow PCR tests dog indicates passenger positive. child's troll account, ignore it. aquarium filters use uv. Column + Column B add Column C shitty culture working overtime vs unemployed Wow. You‚Äôre getting paid far low. :( 

I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre going through! It'll happen anyway. People going endanger friends relatives die permanently harmed thing. 

If anything, ENOUGH restrictions. Indoor bar restaurant service, movie theatres, things like never reopened. actually today work. yesterday. getting harder harder deal knowing easy way out. Meanwhile see lot people around thinks virus BS. Absolutely. I'm working paramedic biggest city state. We're frequently shutting 30-40% ambulances every day due understaffing. We're worked ground. Coworkers talking quitting common conversation, even front supervisors. Morale rock bottom administration tells us ""make morale"". Zero raises. hazard pay. Many us (including me) forced absorb duties responsibilities lieutenant position without actually promoting people. quality people hire dropped greatly. used standard state we're joke.  expect people boondock state understand exponential growth. going look like ""first next nothing, soon killing people left right,"" them, danger realized retrospect.

It ""October surprise"". Hopefully shake voters firmly Trump's death cult. outdoor activities encouraged. crowded house parties issue think dogs catch covid. !? Wait crying work normal? acknowledged I‚Äôm ya. 

I‚Äôve actually clocked kept working would rather job let go put many extra hours. Never minded call center work it‚Äôs never worth lousy pay whopping 10 bucks hour. seen curve lately? *is* flatten curve. People want admit they're desperate go back pre-covid. Ain't happening. carnage cleaners, cooks, waiters, cashiers, etc. lose jobs. insurance, possibly, maybe homes.

Well apparently home office decided cut ecommerce assistant manager position stores makes happy since particular manager one fired losing position take whatever crumbs home office decides offer him. luck maybe end unemployed like me.  tell someone's wearing mask truly believe cause they're wearing get CVS. There's subtle difference way fabric hangs nose. TL;DR fuck call centers

I worked call center local tv/internet provider 4 years. ended quitting couldn‚Äôt go work without panic attack crying parking lot. 
The company awful, single mom took job well minimum wage full benefits. kid sick wasn‚Äôt allowed daycare couldn‚Äôt go work I‚Äôd late finding sitter, 1000% company‚Äôs problem means. AWFUL though, would treat like shit whole day trying juggle life.

Except referred doctor. print email counsellor prove it. 
I left never went back. Idk ban 60s leaving homes, would think prevent coming contact young. agree figured major clothing companies got board would want limit possibility sued making effective possible. Instead got masks barely meet standards. Half masks sale could easily make myself, pathetic. Yeah really seem editorialised opinionated like say showing CDC data. 

Have messaged mod team yet? amount stealing fraud shady shit likely huge it‚Äôll never fully investigated. People knew big monitor acted accordingly. terms loan allowed so. doesn‚Äôt matter reasoning was. expert. can‚Äôt face response virus, lie right start people, upset people don‚Äôt trust experts. else lying then? already established willing lie fit agenda. hospitals aren‚Äôt buying masks Home Depot could wear riot Helmets whatever shift. wear gas mask grocery store help too. informative
Very non-biased. way telling cruel truths matter factly feel prepared frightened. Frenchmen think are?! Americans? regret pulling preschooler out. wear mask fine. got apps, like ABC mouse, teach stuff, it‚Äôs socialization that‚Äôs really miss on. We‚Äôll get next year... also cry work, I'm worried dying near much actually head  know takes couple weeks see full effect virus spread right? Oh, bad. reason took seriously class (in engineering school) considered one biggest terms parties school. 2. bad bud Unlike NZ Sweden borders open everyone Inside Schengen area (or EU/EEA, sure right now)  Instances VAT properly applied rare Communism without massive corruption top. fair criticism say would applied everything, see Europe. Politicians love promote ideas one way change approval implementation. finally complete breakdown. work bank teller thankfully allowed take personal leave absence. never done anything like lost ability stop crying felt like walking shell human. cares someone invented idiotic contraption, that's non sequitur. could safely wear full hazmat suit right? cares.

They wear N95 respirators. wear N95 respirator clean shaven, feel free look up. Beliefs irrelevant. countries actually give shit mental well-being citizens. good thing. Maybe workers overwhelmed employer country treated like valued sack meat meant keep economy alive. seem like do. obvious slightest, actually. Seems like frankly would prefer do. article recommendations weighing risks/low risk activities? would love see epidemiologists saying comfortable (there published back May-June) reading studies talk transmission rates outdoors. Thank you! response, follow person claim harassing around? Kinda odd behaviour, could construed trying harass me? I'm sorry. know working seniors right really tough. 

All worry health various rules allowing visitors creating issues depression. Nobody said end. different.

We move get jobs, get married, opportunities.

It's lot harder make new friends work full time, spouse, home, kids.

I many life long friends still keep touch with, live hundreds thousands miles away. new friends years, ""work buddies"" after-hour meetups far between. work time spent family. Good thing watchdog fund happen... oh wait... Trump removed day 1 riots health officials saying ""masks made spread"" makes sense people think ""if mask whatever want."" I'm stressed. Pretty solidly stressed.

And work belligerent people refusing wear masks, fear government cuts put job, literally fight save people's lives also answering phone calls telling people bad news family members.

I cannot f'ing imagine poor workers going genuinely wondering do. applauded first (and called 'virtue-signaling noise makers' cynical jerkwads course), rallied specific cases (Postal workers threatened Trump). else do?  Like miracle, go away. Is. believe still sees patients Yeah essential worker shit. Back March Michigan shut taking care grandpa's one omwas fresh surgery going hospital husband lonely I'd keep company. work 2 people position another guy wuth 2 kids home. knew lockdown started it'd got off. Personally, situation grandpas wanted it. went sick week lock came back informed another coworker sick tested positive covid person could job bailed even sooner anyone learned guy covid.

Tldr: taking care sick grandparents, coworker got time another coworker got covid come anyway. Creepy bronzer bois There's post Nextdoor whether trick r treating year, 80% yes comments. Schools area remote only, Halloween important guess. used ride bus 45 minutes hour depending traffic people got long me. one way. busses cramped. enact state emergency peacetime. 

The downside peace long. Eventually attitude ""it cant happend here"" pops Yes, can. can‚Äôt take time go doctor? worked Meijer took time doctors appointment. can‚Äôt that?  Oh please half country isnt wearing masks.

Do statistic this? actual source this? tell, multiple regions see reports, much half country wearing masks. ones loud obnoxious it.

Regardless, ignored point Halloween masks typically worn DEFAULT. even without pandemic, many/most would wear masks. since one, probably much mask usage normal. 

I go enjoy. Yeah reason people see masks social distancing multiple choice option, rather complimentary measures. might getting couple different things confused. remember controversy Ruth Chris couple others return loan proceeds back. Maybe PR thing, backlash. 7-day moving average 761, ok. We‚Äôve 1,000 month now. used totalitarian state measures crushed economies, there's end sight pandemic.

North Australia NZ wise up, forced it, even first time.

New study came saying Texas strain virus even *more contagious* less deadly.

Also they're islands, even disagree shortsighted potentially harmful government mandates dignity democracies, there's argument. doubt it'll work long term. proven children zero risk; information long term effects yet.

They also bring home disease parents family members. know really set kid back? parents family members die become permanently disabled due covid. bad news, everything US relevant. makes another county look bad, though, we're like ""wait, talking US?"" Best news ever completely transparent, straightforward calculation updates every couple months. grab underlying CDC data recalculate yourself. well know. I'm Illinois. Fortunately, Governor trying best mitigate much can. He's perfect, governor is, think he's well given lack funding we're Blue. 

For sure, dangerous moron. can't fathom lack humanity sociopathy. Sweden could stop dumb shit people would stop caring. strange thing parochial really happening monetary incentives parents able dedicate time children‚Äôs‚Äô education.

nope, elected officials give loans companies, use pay bonuses buy stock

vote November. Local, state, federal

Democracy idea society general needs help. guard Coronovirus used finish us consolidate world towards Elysium style society. 

Extreme wealth extreme poverty. symptoms? Well anything recent fit narrative. No, Coonman! Also, would make good costume! Amazing one harassers (you) trolling like they‚Äôre innocent. exercise healthcare? it, way could see doctor took time public follow spring / summer.

No normal spring/summer, guess! r/iamverysmart thats hell enough I'm middle shift crier, sometimes front customers show shitty I'm bus right now.

Everybody mask sitting right next other. Did... actually compared WW2 bombings Halloween? Science funny habit stopping, new data comes advice changes. expected shows learning. start senior living center? Let see it, it‚Äôs real means something forced face reality face everyday. Hiding spread going cause people take less seriously. public asked make daily risk calculations, denying information large actually serves make pandemic worse.

If Bob thinks area bad decides go eat shopping long period time, exposure level skyrockets. government lied bad was, could much higher risk would otherwise.

Hiding spread economics sacrificing citizens money. altruistic purpose it. absolutely condition loan document signed every company took loan. worried legit businesses didn‚Äôt want run afoul would later determined access capital via loan owner capital contribution. SBA addressed concern said loan $2MM wouldn‚Äôt scrutinized issue. company took loan excess cash/cash sources may committed fraud. However, nothing clearly defined far constitutes access capital/liquidity. I‚Äôm sure good legal team could pick apart terms vague. Major League Baseball Sure Wiser Americans north here.  know got posted haha. fact I'm kind arguing opposite, quite happy things were. guy social life moved away and/or friends, maybe that's societies fault? boat. Distance learning young kids spectrum disaster. trying get 2 kids stay room try get one focus activity impossible. Right it‚Äôs trying maintain cleanish home, make food, support high risk wife who‚Äôs working tough work deadline. Teachers need paid double. Face shields masks work well together face shield fucking stupid. nearly effective masks. never understand resistance putting fucking mask on.  Yes people PTSD mental problems issues finding way make work despite yet people none issues act like die wear mask even 5 minutes. Reading stories heartbreaking. 

I want give hugs. Lots lots hugs, COVID damned. 

Sadly, offer weak-sounding ‚ÄúThank much do.‚Äù Universities primarily online everywhere, far know. I'm student Stockholm, I've two lectures person year would thought learned lesson asking questions reddit eh? Thanks response! ones said anti bodies wane 3 months even weeks? can't tell sarcasm not. Oh please half country isnt wearing masks. clustering door door. go enjoy. neice nephew got really sick covid, one afib ripe age 10. Good job trying explain basic epidemiology epidemiologist. point know current infection rate is, percentage population recovered infection, use random sampling estimate population parameters. need broad spectrum infection monitoring reporting system that. Nobody gives fuck us medical receptionists, treated like dirt clinical staff treated like dirt entitled public. 

Yeah, want quit change jobs * can‚Äôt exactly get hired right bat good pay I?*

Somedays job makes want cry lunch, days I‚Äôm happy get paid get live place sometimes I‚Äôm scared ledge return. bartender 20 years I‚Äôm done working. Read book? You‚Äôll slave drop dead. you‚Äôll broke. get deserve naive weak. 

Arrested? Lol. You‚Äôre coward. Rip ur grandma sons different many times need explained wanted prevent run PPE needed medical providers knowledge spread advanced since then. buy stocks! complain perpetuate victim mentality? often see people sneezing?

Not often since put feathers away. understand initial issue, comparing Covid flu never actually work. It‚Äôs way communicating general public, it‚Äôs scientific. I've often wondered American people could launch class action lawsuit company things. anyone thread answer that's feasible possibility? Like taxpayers sue company misused funds taxpayer-funded program? MLB? want us care friend's bar (and do), justified people fat and/or health conditions put higher risk dying Covid justified dying? mean, ""it is"", right?  long friend keeps bar home, really matter many sick, old, fat people die, right? They're human anyway, right? numbers stand way want? Stay classy. Obviously know anyone who's died it. Either total piece shit. Maybe both. Republicans Trump see Covid-19 good thing. want people die. Less poor people ""living system"". disgusting. Awww! welcome!üíñ even lock removal comments people can't call terrible modertaing. Mentally weak. He‚Äôs Swede Pretty much every university mostly online afaik. go one biggest ones country, everyone I've spoken mostly online classes. everything online  you‚Äôre CEO Fortune 500 company. absolutely use PPP money payroll it‚Äôs forgiven, consistent terms program. use payroll money stock buybacks.  many times spend weekend watching Predator, Running Man Terminator it‚Äôs weird? Asking friend. difference age adjusted fully adjusted one listen to? üòÖ know. know possible. 

You confuse knowing get rid sample bias lack sample bias. IS, fact, big sample bias, despite fact know fix it. OK - Americas right-wing Show get 24 month loan $10k 1% rate good credit. Swedes perfect obeying recommendations death rate much worse neighbors? Lockdowns effective, Victoria demonstrating. way lock everything 3-6 months virus eliminated, rebuild economies. rich West reason anyone starve made homeless. Unfortunately people rich may rich after. nature war. people streets I'll never know. Apparently I'm suppose scared BLM bunch Anarkiddies, fact government betrayed us, tells us rights anymore beyond working til die, corporate skekzies draining every last cent Trump sends meant public safety pandemic recovery. r/nottheonion Disgraceful surprise absolutely one brain. like that...Florida Man caught Covid-19 Imagine clapping death innocents. america. ""no ones going to"" -- know people going behave, projecting desires onto rest population. Exponential rise also simple concept right? Nope, understand. told customers saw tear would written poor customer service. Nothing cheerful corporate cheerleading employees! 

I worked 5 years finally escaped month ago. fun things knocking work equipment wanting greeter rest shift instead going home doctor.

 told ""too helpful"" staff members. got dirty-needle stick pharmacist threw used needle garbage, even write her. 7 days missed work lost 8 pounds anti-retrovirals forced take me. witness power fully armed operational DEATH STATE!

--Ron DeSantis probably guy perfect example shithole America becoming. Wish feasible move different country.  Congress, didn‚Äôt design program stipulations? cooperation

So mean Brexit cancelled, then? expand innuendo explain trying imply? idea economic damage resulting long term covid complications cost?

Its going lot proper shutdown. Yeah, piles bodies streets. better yet, live life worry dying COVID like like 99.94% Florida's population done far.  cares, let vaccine 7 billion people think environment. Let pandemic get first.. number infections spiked recent weeks among college-age Floridians, DeSantis experts convened said alarmed many never develop serious symptoms. Risk related coronavirus enclosed space that's shared others extended period, school, much greater cases. teacher reckless driver, example, much less likely expose fellow teachers risks come reckless driving.

Risk virus passing infected teacher higher fewer measures taken prevent it. weigh costs benefits requiring masks instance, think much sacrificed, compared negative impact highly contagious disease ravages population teachers (the yearly flu contagious coronavirus is).

Learning stuffer fewer teachers classroom. adding substitutes tamp virus spreading. Older teachers would took sick come in, younger teachers asymptomatic would perpetuate spread virus, keeping older teachers risk.

If school slow spread virus requiring mask usage, thus reducing probability outbreak among teachers that's large enough disrupt teaching, get so.... Word. Thanks engaging Wish lived Canada. US turned real shithole. think restaurants, planes, cruise ships back?

Fat chance... Wear mask; reality change like No! That's scientists talk too. Look chart, see waves. Yeah would trust Florida DOH much dont im ‚Äúon job,‚Äù certainly helps fend depression anxiety. Better boozing time like people doing, thats damn sure. I'd depressed lived place girl pic! Strange different. better source, quick search found article posted. People came senses?

No, people dumber Many worst predictions failed come true.

Which predictions those? Please specific kind accusation rampant here, never seems accompanied kind evidence support it. Either people cognitive capacity understand (yes, people stupid), denial. Usually, both. Florida says, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs open breathe germs!‚Äù  said ""standard evidence"" quantity. regard assumptions potential relationship evidence fact all. standard *correlation causation* situation. rich people. money. glad paid taxes help poor billionaires. Close. ""W"". go first grade second grade whatever they‚Äôll reopen completely unprepared. agree it‚Äôs necessary stay closed I‚Äôm worried kids. economist strikes again! Great clear eyed overview currently stand regarding coronavirus.  That's choice, like tourist choice people go full resteraunt bar. Again, impact others wear masks socially distance minimally would result masks. Please keep wearing masks everyone! [I'm looking rolling average hypothetically trending still nowhere near low enough kinds things researchers estimated tested SARS-CoV-2 four days infection 67% likely test negative, even virus. average patient began displaying symptoms virus, false-negative rate 38%. test performed best eight days infection (on average, three days symptom onset), even false negative rate 20%, meaning one five people virus negative test result.

Not giant lot use testing least 4 days exposure, ideally 7 days. course, assuming tests tough get; get tests every couple days area freely, knock out. numbers never accurate alarms parents think shit still worse common flu...which kills ""400,000 people year"". Cool dad, worldwide numbers Corona double 8 months...  about? Using ECDC numbers Denmark 2.7 times cases Sweden (13/09/2020 - 25/09/2020). Hell school work can't even go campus testing center test. random drawings. need test go clinic something company gave women ovarian cancer talc...? really wish fucking disease prominent billionaires. also might die  answered argument here. lot tougher argue we've months shit getting better, plus there's factor shit getting better partially/mostly people bother? Classic Prisoner's Dilemma too.

I tell one thing, single one fear-mongering ""covid destroy lungs heart 5ever even completely asymptomatic"" article made remotely worried health social distancing half year made worry mental health. bad news. US terrible internet service network outages capacity issues help fill void. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis moves fully reopen virus' playground

*fixed accuracy  I'm shocked I‚Äôll sign tests

No biggie Amen amen automatic runner extras! comment fact-based. Masks shown relationship transmission reduction. Without practically stating outright; hard think telling headline happned U.S. :) have, stay indoors lockdown prohibitions. Pfizer :) People downvoting suggesting might make short mid-term sacrifices children parents grandparents blame human beings. Oh broken repeatedly figured out. think stuck emotions like sensations physiological responses chemicals brain. would less hungry decide eat haven‚Äôt dinner know friend hungry too? No, cause would dumb helpful. would sadness, depression, pain(insert demon choice here) different? would rather weigh like since reason work financial gain. wage make worth risking hospital bill over? You‚Äôll put you‚Äôve made last 6 months get Covid. fired Target January 25th 2020. Thank again, Target. welding doors works? Hey, may suffer serious mental conditions stress, ignore friends family find relaxing mundane useless sense I'm work making pay rate getting storm; atleast go...i know essential.... Lots salty trolls thread. key point underlies Swedish strategy: long term sustainability. 

A lot people laughed argument spring wanted settle matter right looking worldometer leaderboard. response marathon sprint. People laughed too. don‚Äôt think laughing anymore. least Spain things starting look grim already. 

The season started winter coming. unfortunately, many die. second wave joke thi far over. safe. identify proportion population still vulnerable, though--could realistically done less logistical difficulty vaccinating everyone? Woke up... Saw title.... praying article written Trump r/NoShitSherlock Seriously humility would gone long way. feels like Sweden acted way bullshit idea swedish supremacy.

The painful thing tho is, Swedes hasnt learned anything. Tegnell still approval rate 60 something% somehow absolutley baffles me. people recover generate protective immune response, outbreak leave growing trail immune people. enough people immune, fewer susceptible people become infected outbreak die away.  social distancing measures early could risk surge infections. outbreak brought control social distancing measures, it‚Äôs possible small proportion population infected gained immunity.  population achieved herd immunity, enough susceptible people may remain fuel second wave controls relaxed infection 0.02% 0.04% people 50? looked promising early pandemic seem fallen behind. monoclonal candidate past phase 1? common knowledge Vitamin levels body huge effect fighting virus. theory adequate sunshine year round also Indian diet may helpful.

Also, study showed stark difference prevalence virus, compared blood group patient.
For example, people blood group much susceptible virus blood groups.
India's population majority B+ blood group (nearly 40% population that) 20% A+ group.
This opposite see many western countries, majority A+ blood group.


Or ofc numbers totally botched far social media, seen citizens reporting mass uncounted fatalities like saw Ecuador months ago, dead bodies lying streets. something sort happened, would shared everywhere instantly, since half million ppl use social media. knows Okay, what‚Äôs plan? get improbable vaccine wait another year full immunity? likely get flu-like vaccine love lives. Well, Rome capital. title sounds normal. Rome = Italian government could summarize lessons (there good bad) would these

The bad: 

1. underestimate need limit index cases act quickly start epidemic. \*assume\* travelers specific country affected, example. quarantines situation clear risks one quaranine many, next time that's happen, people understand. Sweden 10% entire population travel abroad period Lombardy outbreak. Many alps. 

2. think saying ""need protect elderly"" actually accomplishes it. funding, training equipment needs too. wasn't. 

3. scrap civil preparedness cold war ends (field hospitals, reserves PPE). Sweden massive cold war resources half dozen huge field hosipitals on. scrapped recent times. pandemic hit, basically 1-2 field hospitals available. 


The good:

1. impose restrictions (unless absolutely necessary) can't maintained long term. E.g. risk strict restriction ""have"" lift, point time may even worse added, cold season. 

2. make complex rules change quickly causing confusion. travel restrictions regions X country Z next day region right paperwork... thing: change think change next week. Change rules genuinely believe new set rules sustainable.

3. Ask people follow restrictions instead forcing to, also make \*possible\* so, quickly changing sick leave laws, adding emergency funding businesses businesses still pay salaries, rents on.

4. Care small children (daycare school young kids) kept open long possible positive effects allowing parents important jobs like nurses work outweighs small increased spread creates. I've med/surg nurse 7 years. Nursing driven alcoholism eating disorders destroyed physical mental health. wish every single day could go back time things differently. people better coping others, however. Nursing good fit me, pragmatic option job climate. mostly sunken cost fallacy keeping it. Swedens cases rising aswell get royally fucked.

Again.

And nothing done.

Someone fucking save us gyms rated max capacity? go gym PA, said Gyms 50% capacity, problem gym 700,000 Square feet, includes hotel, restaurant, climbing areas, fields, etc could probably hold like 50k people. half like 25k people... pretty much entire gym always full....  scientist's point view: 

There absolutely scientific evidence believe virus becoming less ""contagious"". significant changes detected molecular level would support theory. 

It people's behavior either helps spreading prevents it. case France newly also Czech Republic, people showing middle finger precautions preventive measures. learn dangerous severe corruption be. Must first article Sweden longer compared Denmark Norway, norm 6 months 

We know why, pathetic sad frustrating situation. can‚Äôt even imagine anxiety helplessness wife must feel. truly empathize you. hoping ordeal would finally give teachers respect recognition (and support) deserve; seemed beginning parents first remote learn it‚Äôs head spinning quickly turned demanding quit whining, get back schools, job! it‚Äôs jobs now. didn‚Äôt sign front lines, definitely didn‚Äôt sign put loved ones danger, comfort students lose someone COVID, much lesson realistically get you‚Äôre managing social distance students, masks breaks, bathroom hand washing breaks, teaching person virtually?! 

You wife respect. Stay safe ‚ù§Ô∏è cannot copy Sweden's model even tried real hard. Damn message wanna vent. Italy committed thorough lockdown Europe. know needs done. Cried yesterday work staff public awful time.  0% probably bit low. Seems going okay. can't stand people crying bored quarantine. get vacation. I'm essential. I'm tired all. country really sucks. Thats reassuring That's ""Sweden"", that's one person, Tom Britton. Smoking glass vape good solution. take one hit call night want. flu, hospitals full capacity people play sick get steal toilet paper. 

A million people died 10 months, serious enough you? What's magic number need? Yesyes here. test get test result next day. mean deaths registrations. I've never heard 24 hour updates. Gloat (in bad taste) March w√¨nter passed. know then. incredibly stupid post (even without commenting poor taste). blue angels flying them. jesus. next academic report 3 feet tall unusual symptom. necessary hateful sarcastic? Yay, another symptom add onto list covid symptoms pretty much includes every symptom known man.

First quarantined classes return school
Regional authorities believe number classes quarantine reasonable level. regions, Navarre Arag√≥n, authorities point classes placed isolation schools first reopened begun return. Others, Basque Country, say rate quarantined classes slowed down. general, education authorities say goal still maintain greatest number face-to--face classes possible. despite fact restrictions may introduced social contexts virus continues spread.


Based available information, largely come countries reopened schools summer beginning August, public health experts Salvador Peir√≥ believe schools unlikely major hotspots transmission. schools islands, region high transmission rate, likely reflected schools, explains Peir√≥, member Fisabio, health research foundation run regional government Valencia. could make difficult schools continue normal academic year planned. example, Madrid region, highest incidence rate Covid-19 Spain, also highest number classes quarantine since beginning school year. Last Friday, 168 classes isolation, figure jumped 832 Wednesday.

Differences regions
EL PA√çS asked regional authorities number classes quarantined since schools reopened. 13 replied. None specified age students, indicated number affected classes percentage total. Madrid, 832 classes quarantined (1.4% total) since students returned school. region second-highest number quarantined classes Catalonia 602, followed Basque Country (268, 1.5%), Castilla-La Mancha (180, 1%), Andalusia (168, 0.2%), Arag√≥n (148, 1.7%), Navarre (142), Castilla Le√≥n (141, 1%), Valencia (130, 0.3%), Extremadura (73), Balearic Islands (49, 0.7%), La Rioja (33) Galicia (27).

The difference reflection several factors. First, transmission rate disease varies greatly regions: Madrid, 14-day cumulative incidence Covid-19 742.6 cases per 100,000 inhabitants, compared 114.4 Galicia, according Tuesday‚Äôs epidemiological report. Secondly, regions delayed start school year, classes returning two weeks later others. lastly, regions update figures every day others every week: Andalusia Valencia, example, latest figures Monday.

Regional authorities Canary Islands, Asturias Cantabria reply EL PA√çS‚Äôs request. Murcia offered number students teachers quarantine, 187 43 respectively, number classes. case Madrid, unions argue transmission rates schools higher reported regional government official statistics.

Other countries made gamble ""we find solution, we'll take direct eco hit lowering trade"" assumption effective treatment strategies relieve near future.

Both approaches eco hit, one ""double eco hit"" gamble fails, (the one lockdown double, still need pay cost sick populace).

If effective treatment found time, Sweden's approach would benificial country. I'm also running assumption lockdown/no lockdown done correctly, anarchy costs.

""There many companies US"" reason fraud. fact, that's statement utter nonsense. Alternate headline: ‚ÄúFlorida Governor Ron DeSantis moves fully welcome Coronavirus Wave 2‚Äù Pretty sure designed way little oversight.

Hey Americans plenty **capitalist countries** there, treat **workers** **shit**!

&amp;nbsp;

For fucking starters:

- payed holiday leave *(Americans holiday, rare)*
- payed maternity leave (both men &amp; women)
- payed sick leave. expert. bet still need study happens people skin conditions. workers 8-12 hours day. However. I‚Äôd first read years ago science article caught eye back studying years believe. Ya repealed get charge want condition have....$1200 month cheap That's hilariously wrong.

At least 0.06% US died COVID-19. number lower thrown out.

~0.3% NYC died. Another lower bound. Yes? Get Would love see list trustworthy. system rigged, always been. get it. keep going rallys cute little red hats, leave masks home. Trump bullshit hot orange air spews protect ""imaginary virus"" yeah, lot deaths also nursing homes. average life expectancy around 80 years, unfortunate cause less long term damage everything opens back up. shock? [paper reviewing children‚Äôs immune response  record, illusions listening, even posting good faith. I'm replying you; mind made up.

I'm posting everyone comes along reads us. complete utter nonsense. Children's teacher, janitor, support staff class mates, sadly, die time non-Covid reasons. 

Yes... but... many non-Covid cases could children source infection? 

I finding pandemic stressful, I'm worried health life, I'm much worried spreading Covid people, like mother. Right now, kids spreading teachers. fault, course, another aspect consider. Swedes shame flat earthers. Lol professors administrators treat college students like kids, going act like kids. thats point senate... everyone number senators. know, ask Public Health Agency, I'm expert. think missing point. privately owned company work took almost $2-million PPP loans. stayed open since critical industry. coworkers come work every day. company posted record profits. still open posting record profits, need loans. still took loans. spent money new vehicles (and I'm sure nice bonus owner / president CEO) stopped giving raises due uncertain times.

Let say again. company made money year last year, still got $2 million free money paid tax payer, owner deemed volatile give employees raises. I‚Äôm liberal goes show sub r/politics disguise. Missouri governor gets it. Lmao dude idiot! Va governor gets it. Thoughts prayers.  Nah try making money Don‚Äôt gaslight, months ago every post ‚Äúso much winning‚Äù anti American rhetoric. get saying copy-pasted liberal platitudes like make feel like I'm fucking facebook, come on. don‚Äôt know anyone justify rules. rules also state allowed enter businesses grocery stores allowed go work unless facing severe food insecurity.

Of dumb covid related rules seen, takes cake. We'd see 150,000 confirmed cases daily even approach 3,000 deaths day.

The death rate static. ICU's fill up, death rate spikes. linear extrapolation account this. Well according IFR  1.1% 1.4% men 0.58% 0.77% women, compared 0.0018% narcolepsy flu vaccine, 500 times lower. OK know rates long lasting non-fatal effects COVID, seems reasonable assume would greater 0.0018% based 1% ish fatality rate. VAT + Universal Basic Income regressive. i'll stay hotel. dont know percebtage, willing put time try find that, first article searching ""complications covid 19 recovery"" googs. pages time left life look at. Mayo line, isolated incident, rather endemic Covid19, time goes shift made scare dying scare living Covid past see many many many articles sort reckon. countries community spread far between. 

But still looks extremely rare occurrence. Full reopening right flu season? could possibly go wrong? Europe: Hold wine. US artificially manufactured quarantine, making go far longer ever to, exact reason

the entire thing played grift. Every fucking aspect big fucking grift, enriching friends Trump, stomping poor, predominantly POC individuals possible democrat voters keeping paralyzed unable anything, vilify ""rioting""

it's grift, guys. big fucking grift. course did. news? met one person, Reddit real life, directly benefited PPP loan program. Businesses took ""loans"" still laid employees. paid straight pocketed money. let's real, loans. ""forgivable loan"" cash payment. Call is. lockdown freedom Swedish people vs total lockdown isolation resulting upfuck economy understand change might hard see. 

Quite expected. forgot /s. It‚Äôs coincidence slave owners made lot major corporations. No. Fundamental human rights transcend culture. corporate hand-out good banking relationships, targeted aid package like advertised.

You get gold star today homework. Didn‚Äôt even think that.

why give business ""hope"" actually fucking pay people know wont' understand..My friends make good money, like close six figures years graduating colleges..I also got certifications help long way fine. people reddit say poverty..what went wrong you? Looks like vote manipulation brigade back force time election Oh yeah sure, west africans know drill already understand..My friends make good money, like close six figures years graduating colleges..I also got certifications help long way fine. people reddit say poverty..what went wrong you? didn't. Later, fools. Lol tell never lived small college town really matter believe, long advocate countermeasures proven effective. Right that. 

Do they? 6 feet social distancing rule based fact US CDC believe spread covid aerosol unlikely. currently, suspicions covid spread air. US CDC do? Announce covid airborne get rid 6 feet rule? keep 6 feet rule? Well, let people provinces go home too?

People provinces Chinese citizens. drastic measures taken beginning, yes, also keep foreigners quarantine.

There many countries implemented quarantines. countries banned foreigners leaving country? lots problems banning people citizens leaving country.  good idea May July, surely even better idea December,

Not necessarily. Banning flights created panic, lead large number people trying catch last couple flights country, means large deluge people difficult test quarantine. better strategy ban, controlled evacuation. advocate mask wearing though long time, see, even April. 

This WHO. US CDC thing, advocate mask wearing. US Surgeon-General. blaming US government essentially thing? free open borders it‚Äôs Economy fuck hard NZ nobody wear masks understand around mindset. Honestly, people tend wear masks distance anyway tend less apt go crowded places begin with, ""dangerous"" people online say are. coming from:

The media plays huge role, not, take blame, this.

We live click-bait era journalism. Alot people followed news decades see journalistic standards nosedived. Many articles people citing fact actual opinion pieces series what-if questions disguised research. disheartening someone older whose watched decline real journalism brushed ""right wing talking point"" ""fox news"" - issue people sides worried about. think left leaning currently worried favor last years, whose say always case? Personally, read NYT 25 years finally stopped getting bad. think younger people start reading might take years realize much become opinions what-ifs disguised journalism. think ""OMG NYT true."" Well, might've good stance 30 years ago, now.

To point, media churned loads ""facts"" covid prematurely, skewed towards ""covid worse actually is"" side, especially March April. backfired media lost credibility.

Same ""protests OK"" narrative. time media publishing articles drive-in church super-spreader, groups 1000s people major cities media saying can't spread disease. 

I think media also over-censored stuff herd immunity masks super-effective. stuff google researching March April. Anytime over-censor stuff, people think something hide. still understand studies masks preventing viruses went. doubt retracted. MO life ""out truth things usually settle correctly."" case, means leaving articles masks super-effective. Let people look ones say super-effective. Deleting articles suppressing google searches indeed backfire, despite people want claim. hydrochlouriquine. horrible, ineffective, let people publish articles it. many articles get deleted right away? saying BS, people realize it. Let's give people credit.

Instead, rush delete makes people think media hiding something. Streisand effect, will. 

And really, media invested one? like people going run buy hydrochlouriquine run back work without mask. Stop projecting liberal democracy values onto every society. People ways dealing things long force adopt ways right judge whether they're ""civilized"" not. Yet people got used dealing viral contagion point. There's thing job rotation. people work rotating schedule jobs considered desirable vs ones undesirable. consideration practicality course, taking measures minimize necessity shit work.

Hell that's lot households chores. literally point chore wheel.

Someone needs dig ditches, mean next week can't something fulfilling worked cushy job week take turn ditches.

Also keeps people becoming myopic sheltered high prestige job occasionally go menial duty.  words concept comment exact words concepts article?

That's language works. even unique English. 60% vote Thank you! Here's hoping it'll 0 sooner rather later :) sub delusional. think Florida bad without thinking going surpass Ny. Take political goggles almost like trump got rid watch dogs type behavior companies type behavior. Weird. right, article cheering there's hundred dead children majority could prevented. right schools opening indeed even states are, know death statistics lag. many child deaths reach stop sucking others dicks great cold little corpses bigly hugely successful job like believe protecting them. mention children lasting potential life-long complications. Yea way report sensationalizes treated smells like typical Western anti-China fake news. possible disappeared embelllished ridiculous claims pander Western audience. 

Anyone actually spent enough time China knows CCP strict authoritarian, they're monsters torture people reason stupid enough think blasting propaganda full volume help cause somehow, think ""let's release people torturing tell whole world!"" seem remember mention language bill specifically prevented stock buybacks. asking people go school. go work. Potentially lose jobs like millions already. see friends family. enjoy hobby. travel. on.

I hate people even understand social distancing is. Social distancing prevent that. literally enables people things safely.

Also, almost every country barred incoming travel non-residents. nothing social people getting tired things mentioned.

New Zealand, Singapore, Finland, South Korea, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, Taiwan even Sweden largely open months, since May. There's reason economy cannot reopened safely people follow recommendations.

This literally New Zealand June: people tell ""oh might lose job, also see people. Also cancel vacation. Also go eat. Also really anything except sit home"" maybe i'm reluctant that's selfish.

Which social distancing guidelines recommend that? maintain distance possible public gatherings beyond group size restriction. Meanwhile, wear mask reinforce benefit social distancing.

Still, point irony, health experts across EU attributed main cause second wave people breaching social distancing holding parties congregating bars/restaurants beyond guidelines. What's point people wanting things reopened going take steps ensure stays south nothing dwell on, people vilpend?

No, think understood correctly. no, pandemic really changed anyone, really. allowed people sharpen already finer edges. Vaccine working? balance keep economy running enough people make ends meet.

NZ excellent job containing virus expense GDP go shit. EU predicted double dip recession lockdown measures re-instituted.

The US bungled things public health standpoint, country recover additional round lockdowns. much community spread we‚Äôre better grinding away safe vaccine approved FDA. Ok, kinda answer goddamn thing.

Maybe stop loftily arrogant, actually explain fuck trying get across. 

And way, class ""cold war"" pretty much exactly going now. explanation ultra rich got insanely richer everyone else suffered. Situations like pandemic chat IRC Discord. object saying ‚Äúonly‚Äù 100 children died. Saying ‚Äúonly‚Äù front numbers dead children wrong book. see part explicitly pointed (in bold) Cal U playing football fall? 


I agree Press tends sensational. dad conspiracy theorist mom simply thinks vaccines viruses ineffective. generally pro-vax though. say wanna say chief say marginally better spending tax dollars pointless wars, barely I'm sorry getting downvoted. expected make sense sub lied entire economy depends dollars generated tourism entertainment venues. understand DeSantis coming imo amoral sacrifice tens thousands lives sake economy. particularly true FL large elderly population that's risk. first time, I‚Äôm upset Florida isn‚Äôt headline...

Nevermind, thats enough reddit day. countries Sweden showed growth Q1, explains relatively large drop Q2. rich got richer coronavirus..working home taking vacations/going friends gave lot cash anything? feel like sub started majority people didn‚Äôt realize going shocked now.

But honestly, shocked administration handled situation chaos surrounding it, paying attention last four years federal governance.

Good luck. ""idea"" discussing gatekeeping. Don‚Äôt silly. 

The main driver putting pandemic plan place epidemiologists charge back early January, ‚Äî whether gross error design, CDC refused use profferred test kits, insisted deploying own, defective.

This allowed NYC NJ go Covid flames. We‚Äôll never know many cases NYC had. ***Because didn‚Äôt tests capacity test***. 

All fed-level failure. trickle economics about? That's true, even countries little community spread testing it. Except China. also don‚Äôt ability run money printing presses fast USA EU without targeted hedge funds betting currency. corporate socialism, right tell socialism bad, it‚Äôs bad give back people Shit old woman too. that's call text wall

I'm sure missed something. things may sound like restrictions important thing remember bit different many countries (where fine force essentially instead trusting people) agency goes recommendations guidelines, essentially something people expected adhere too. Personal responsibility big. Business-wise, charged reported. Individual-wise, face shame breaking jante law idiot stands one likes approves of. look numbers (travel/movement, sickness days, economy etc), tell majority listened spring particular. relaxed attitude sadly though together cold weather making numbers rise :(

Edit: another important thing add FHM also encouraged people still go outdoors (parks etc), take walks generally stay active/exercise long keep distance, keep recommendations sick. instance sex partner. deemed positive benefits public health outweighs risks. Anything? heard craigslist? Strangers pay good money cum mouth. Yay celebrating preventable child deaths could worse simultaneously sending back school.

Also, lethality numbers obviously account long-time patients still struggling virus half year effect widespread non-lethal infection could healthcare systems general population disability long-term, given remaining unknowns surrounding virus. ""the deadliest thing ever"" even little deadly rightfully treated grave concern. People live relatively normal lives HIV now, still want risk getting it. vaccine, even people get sick, think things like heart inflammation blood clots unlikely occur? relates minimum high level community spread means people get sick die. Say it‚Äôs vulnerable,who see think ones issues. make ok? Community spread prelude cases, deaths stress healthcare system.

This real problem apparently. Government employees wear masks government recommends them. Nursing Home Bronx appears, paper, escaped worst coronavirus pandemic, official state count four deaths 146-bed truth, according home, far worse: 21 dead, transported hospitals succumbed.

You think half living nursing homes died nursing home think got transported hospital passing? Also double it, 13,000 deaths blowing every state water hitting countries average. Antibody tests reliable determining immunity though. Many people immune getting virus test negative antibodies. watch anti-union video orientation, sign documents saying start union. 

The last time heard Walmart employees started union, company closed store left entire town. Wait, take back.

I think McDonald's requires employees wear masks. That's like constitution something. would strengthen company?

It strengthen future returns shareholders, course means greater risk company (cash door). There's literally reasoning this. literally deranged. can't rid virus social engineering behaviour. know make clear. believing falsehoods. ultimate ""pull bootstraps"" societal level, taken extreme beyond comprehension. Covid deniers say lockdown waste time gutted!

So declare covid spread aerosol right now? US CDC, authoritative infectious disease organization world, agrees covid spread aerosol. think American CDC working together cover up? Americans lying? PRC's malicious conduct case, thought would common knowledge now.

The accusation China prevented flights country make sense me. lot foreigners living China. flights essentially evacuation foreigners. China prevent people leaving home countries? holding hostage kidnapping? also telling one least affected countries ROC, right neighbourhood PRC - reached success consistently going advice PRC

Countries like Korea also neighborhood, pretty well following conventional advice. spread Korean churches, covid performance would even better. recall, Korea never banned flights China either. Also wonder later countries adopted least tried adopt measures.

What measures these? Mask wearing? Social distancing? conventional methods, pioneered anyone particular. Pretty sure explicitly waived normal SBA requirement access sources funding.

Oh agreed, casework seen, people escalating quite lot pandemic.

This DISCRIMINATION That‚Äôs gotta get stronger microorganisms, can‚Äôt let dictate lives! So... even single recent article back nonsensical claim? Got it. Seriously though, look linked studies, also consider fact countries people regularly wear masks returned normal, countries like US are... well look daily death counts. Go name then, SBA data available Even less London whenever I've used train (admittedly rarely seeing looks like plague pit) sometimes 50% masks on. Seems get worse east go central line terrible  Covid fatalities remain low infection numbers rising?

They remain low. risen exactly proportional cases, one (full) month later. headline keeps getting propagated despite entirely false.

France 500 daily cases 10 deaths (2% CFR) summer lull. month cases rose factor 6, last month second factor 4. Deaths increased factor 6, they're delayed full month cases second factor 4 come play likely overall less deadly, know exactly why. single biggest thing nursing homes, responsible super-spreading 50% deaths, easily protected via testing. also drugs (rem dex) reduce mortality small factor, maybe 25%. hope vitamin summer greatly reduces number people severe cases, lower viral load also, evidence two things minimal.

But IFR spring around 1-1.5% proof whatsoever dropped. assume has, we're probably right, look evidence find any. compare countries though? Comparing Nordic countries say lot, everything. Comparing countries really difficult, get good answer years. America could find way make healthy buck still keep attitude self-destruct - MF DOOM upper room uvc systems used quite time. problem need them, retrofitting room take time money. preface, I'm dismissing masks, questions I've wondering about.

Here UK, masks mandatory shops public spaces now, cases still seem shooting all. reopen doubt effectiveness masks, even current understanding virus spread?

I'm also seeing topic come CDC said masks work. know story needed limit many masks used, really blame folks feeling like they've got shaken faith health officials, lied us once, believe now? also know another angle case miscommunication; word sent officials, including Fauci ""Tell public use masks"" interest reserving healthcare workers, got interpreted ""masks work"", I'm told word still found CDC website (maybe use Wayback Machine?) definitively ""masks nothing prevent spread"", making sound like evidence conclusive.

At point can't think anything say masks' support. I'm finding desperately *hope* there's still reason wear them, want wall defence virus.

Again, please think I'm actively trying disparage masks. confidence kinda shaken, I'm trying thorough questioning want bases covered.

Lastly, one opinion I've heard advice masks changed health reasons, political motivations. Given current ""us vs. them"" climate, totally doubt this, time I'm unsure political incentive there'd this. anyone know? Ya dont get tested positive covid 19 preexisting condition insurance cover internal organs future......good luck..... That's cool, what's point? know tweeting right now, right? fucking theft.

AFAIK, saliva tests exist quantities needed general public (they're relatively new).

that's different someone already feeling sick getting PCR.

Suddenly, government says going helping people out, including businesses, yay! going give money.

*Supposed* paying emp- that's important, they're giving us money!!!

So let business slow down, fire people layoff, furlough, whatever new fancy loophole word we've got tax breaks 2021. Employee expenses go way down, making us even money!

Money comes in, start repair losses fix business buying stock around strengthening things top-down. say top-down stops 12% top rest gets cut!

Cut money, employee expenses go down, money stays pocket, government paying us even it!

Post record profits among global crisis, shape look like re-investing company, *actual* profits low, crisis! We're totally, fine, making money ever before, PROFITS DOWN!!!!!!!

Like everyone. here. constantly tell wife: giving science change catch up.

A little topic, seems like something interested in: I've intrigued relatively unknown pandemic 1889 1890 originally attributed influenza virus, proposed human coronavirus jumped bovines (this article fantastic)

**The gist it:**

CoV-OC43 causes common cold, might caused much severe illness made first jump humans. Could coronavirus transition humans, initially causes severe pandemic, eventually abates virus mutates becomes completely endemic population?

Of course, we're talking course 130 years case, time, pandemic lased resurged course years, eventually abated.

I wonder virus eventually follow suit; could already seeing evidence that? border Zimbabwe Zambie, Zimbabwean side scenic though (but easy visit both). Why? truly shocked news. Welcome United States Shareholders. humans matter. problem statistical analysis people spin bullshit correlations draw dumbass conclusions like trailer parks cause tornadoes ""because data show people died sit restaurant proves sit restaurants safe""

He‚Äôs seen rallies supporting one wearing masks, even though it‚Äôs required state. That's heresy say site. understanding Florida, Texas, California identical ways except mask mandates?

You idea talking about. Cases went *up* Texas California *after* statewide mask mandates. Democrats amazing tearing apart. They‚Äôll throw wolves even getting suspension middle school. deemed-okay though? That's fundamental problem US, standards transparency gutted b/c badly crisis managed.

understood vaccine children near, overall risk would go dramatically susceptible populations receive overall transmission risk significantly adults generally receive it. gross incompetence areas, able open schools rather quickly vaccine adults broadly available.

i disagree 'bunker vaccine' point. Rather, bunker community transmission trending towards surpassing contact/trace capability. lots places reopened relatively successfully thereafter, smart staging that.

Blaming public health officials secondary impacts strikes tad disingenuous, advice ignored. secondary impacts going dramatically worse b/c follow initial restrictions

Agreed! stipulation PPP loan could've easily company could pay dividend buy back shares, help make money people already money. company contract, shareholders vote remove suspend contract want PPP loans.

Yeah 401K US retirement plan option tax penalties taking money certain age. pay money back avoid penalties. It‚Äôs little confusing. And....250-440k die every year due medical errors, secondary infections hospital stay, etc.

Reality - lot Americans deaths could prevented every year. Difference Covid deaths (most likely) decline time develop cure, hospital-error related deaths rise last decade.

If concern American lives lost we've bigger struggles. disagree points made. point Covid 1918 would expect death toll far exceed death toll today, 100 year advancements health care truly apples apples comes two. Maybe (highly likely) rather unlucky another pandemic compare Covid against. important remember mortality matters here, also long term impacts associated health care costs. Also, every person died covid person likely mattered others. forget humanity pandemic. something happened loved ones Covid would lot trouble getting it. China human right activists muzzled rather directly harmed.

Shit works way sometimes. Lol propaganda Another important factor Sweden wider spread covid back March.

Yes....cause Sweden didint lock down. It‚Äôs flu, though. job rarely issue. time time tracked second. Call handle times standard even though often wildly control. metrics like garbage Net Promoter Score worst idea I've heard data.

In short, micro managed systems hard feel suffocated. article sad, depressing heartbreaking. simply excuse happen largest first world economy world. Wonder governance broken cannot set rectifying this. Especially, due proliferation propaganda country share facts even reality. Cuz, know acrimony fellow citizens, denigrating poor etc. magically going away upcoming election. kind nation wide truth reconciliation effort. Triple confirm, remembering mute cracking open one way. Yes true, I'm looking suburban British viewpoint never busy Halloween Wow, thats fast downvoting. bad attempting explain something rational reason. wonder guys losing minds, depressed, anxious. Good luck that. I'll continue using appropriate caution family rather living fear.

Uhhh VAST majority Americans health insurance. Stop lying. cry work everyday, work public accounting one cares. AlienApricot actively removing sourced counterarguments lockdown skeptic disinformation. removed one posts, fully sourced, showing Covid dangerous flu.

tbh though could completely lying I'd never know, like i'm opening look light would love know kind trash bag idiot downvoted saying government honest. Considering blood everywhere, think symptoms would widespread. Ugh, idea economic term luxury good means? Say regular person needs phone, basic nokia phone arguments sake, VAT apply that. luxury rich person's luxury, considered luxury good since milk bread. Maybe somehow worse next time.

This frightens me. I'm trying downplay COVID-19 all, hell going happen deadlier disease? kids, 10 13, initially disappointed said trick treating year. they‚Äôre excited since we‚Äôre going spend day watching scary movies making Halloween treats. I‚Äôm going buy favorite candies we‚Äôre going make whole day affair. Kids get disappointment. Besides, I‚Äôd rather disappointed kids sick kids. No. comment right there. reread again.  Yes, wonder would correlation. also suppose someone like governor would around tons people time. know are, US least, governors sheriffs seem actively trying *get people infected!* governor Florida wants protect student's right party (during infectious pandemic!). multiple sheriff's departments police precincts said refuse enforce mask mandates overfilling bars/restaurants. goes on. made mistake telling supe call center wanted start consulting firm went business low level employee worked weeks months could produce report presentation could retain workers keep happier. supe, also friend, said ""No one would hire you. one cares employees happy, especially Deep South (US). Management figures never ending stream uneducated women - men - haul train answer phones pay couple dollars minimum wage."" realized later right. None companies invested suspended dividends pandemic, that's nice.

But let's get serious moment. Money fungible alone makes complicated outrage bait headline wants believe. Either money comes stipulations legislation authorized it, doesn't. Blame government pushing garbage bill everyone complaining wanted rush. Oh excess mortality spikes seem start week 10-11 everyone italy started week 8? Article says hospitalizations doubled. did.

I explained you, want google lead example instead going kindergarten principles like ""first"" ""second"". caught staff member worked home. Skin normal flora thing.  Staph move take kill friendly gram positives. 222nm penetrate past dead cell layers. US UK fucked aswell. retrorespect im sure countries like Italy Spain made bad decisions, although understandable cause outside China first ones severlly hit. caught guard

What makes Sweden relativly unique absurd inability learn mistakes Well, friend high school died pneumonia, go flu dead week later. Deaths takes 3-5 weeks spike cases. Seems slow comparison flu. Slow enough, numbers would rising school openings places beginning August.  Except studying tests regularly normal behavior you‚Äôre used doing, may like, experience with. Quarantine social distancing same. agree things becoming lax, also don‚Äôt think ‚Äústay isolated home next six months flatten curve‚Äù possible either. know lot people work including experiencing same. keep pushing us. likely Governor State Mayor City decided this. Brains still vital tourism industry. honestly think parents made decision without consideration developmental social mental health needs child? 

You‚Äôre right could consequences decisions, don‚Äôt know sure either direction. absence empirical evidence, need go works best us. Parents aren‚Äôt making decision flippantly‚Äîespecially puts lot responsibility education them. Mater lives black? set quarantine hotels like china Relatable. quarantine stopped drinking, back office Ive started drinking lot agree. Yeah course. recall told this, might conflict interest... Thanks posting this. always thought lucky far pandemic really reached us around march '20. weeks temperatures high enough coronaviruses less pronounced. still thousands cases/day.

Now full fall season full winter season ahead us. 

I see celebrating Christmas yet. Can‚Äôt, do, anyone expecting otherwise idiot main point car crashes contagious affect people cars. Covid kill anyone time.

Just 70 100 patients side effects mean millions recovered.

If really absolutely nearly everyone damaged heart damaged kidney (some sub told 70% need dialysis LMAO) one would definitely hear WAY this.

And no, subs Reddit count nearly everyone lying karma. is. one going god damn thing it. look us schmucks basically tell us fuck ourselves. TAKE IT! you‚Äôre good odds.

Honestly think he's even forgotten real school setting like, told draw picture ""school"" drew bunch kids desks laptops lol, like new normal repeat crap too. Imagine pushing button hours, days end anything else. Like monkey experiment get rewarded toy banana. add expected concerned surprised whatever people calling about, already know problem heard thousands times can't dam thing actually fix root cause. 8 every 10 people know already infected infected give perspective Less time 

You spend 8 hours cutting floor bus 30 minutes sticking head sand save effective VAT luxury items. Furs, expensive jewelry, luxury cars, yachts (not boats, *yachts*), designer clothing, etc etc. Even adding onto lower end things like cigarettes sugary foods help fund public health problems caused things proven effective. virus live long cold humid surfaces, potentially months... cuomo trustworthy trump snake mask causes stress depression probably see psychologist. mask muzzle. get people thinking misinformation basic bio lol. Yea, extremely likely significantly higher 7 million factor asymptomatic people people never tested. Good need another shutdown.

I really doubt this, considering FHM Socialstyrelsen acted pandemic.  ""no one got hurt"".... popping say, part CARES act qualified FMLA take FMLA covid (medical leave) employer pay percentage wages. paid FMLA. One could argue make us feel better, outside pushing political goals. *want* believe over, rather still problematic bobbing apples lame kid em make caramel apples instead rest sound lit af Go research It‚Äôs churches bars problem True Maybe masks aren‚Äôt effective people think are. can't introduce lockdowns can't enact state emergency peacetime. Otherwise, likely would. Everything I've read though shows they've still used restrictive measures. Nordic countries aged population, much way. 

Sweden immigrants nordic countries what? Please provide data impact corona deaths? Driving sidewalks one. Littering straight onto street window/door. 1.5k yesterday, doubling week ago.

population shows sign interest anything it. Yeah husband call center job wfh since March April, first planning til September realized they‚Äôre working well better home office expect wfh indefinitely. Also couple friends working home, think actually bring home desktop computers instead getting laptops it‚Äôs worked out. many routes illegal immigrants enter SEA. Singapore Brunei protected due landlocked thick forests one side, sea-locked like Singapore. Malaysia, result 2 months lockdown went drain Sabah illegal immigrant wanted see newborn baby another transfered lock detention centre without bring quarantined. (almost 1000 cases now). Indonesia, boats immigrants landed.

I'm looking forward Lombok Ko Phangan 2022. Unless Michigan actively community testing, number cases certainly going higher that. 

Instead protesting stuff like lockdowns masks, people protesting lies indifference human life Michigan state government. Duh. actual amount believe much double? Somewhere neighbor 5 times we've confirmed? 40% working class Americans vote scumbag politicians set first place! know, Jesus told to! (I really hate Jesus maligned highjacked morons.

Nevertheless, given 28.2 million people known infected far, lungs one places clinicians detected damage, **even low percentage implies hundreds thousands people experiencing lasting health tenth let's say seven million confirmed cases US far 700,000 people, perhaps million Christmas, that's exactly ""a thousands"" ""outliers"".

If parents want pay private preschool kindergarten that‚Äôs choice year there‚Äôs pandemic need space. 
I know it‚Äôs popular district alone would freed entire building (preschool only) 16+ kindergarten classrooms. 
That would gone long way spacing hybrid open make much safer school. advocate taking kids anyway. simply talking fact mentally affects kids people letting on. Yeah, reported case count COVID K-12 schools Michigan low. Many schools remote learning (like kids), still many not, doubt Michigan somehow miraculously containing virus many schools can't adhere proper protocols.

Did ignore part?

Why everyone pulls ""kid's get sick card"" ignore piece puzzle? Sure, kids may get hospitalized die send school, bring home give spouse, might, parents might, anyone work might. 

I swear like people incapable thinking even one step ahead.  weird taste mouth first days infection, probably also specific smell Oh yea? data post vaccine Covid infections?

I‚Äôd mask stupid tiny plexiglass ‚Äúshield‚Äù that‚Äôs even still there. maybe hand sanitizer. 

Anyway kinda need go back work financially speaking, rather returning retail I‚Äôm trying look wfh job legit online freelance stuff that‚Äôs possible. hope find something that‚Äôs ok mentally such. doable everyone would it, right? Looking though. Thats one factor. Netherlands deaths Sweden though look excess deaths. 

Another important factor Sweden wider spread covid back march. owe society look other. means limiting gatherings combat spread virus it. no, I'm comparing virus could get worry end ICU without vaccine one leave permanent scars brain/heart/kidneys vaccine That's did, took AGES remotely Windows Explorer. eventually finished found corrupted files (mostly tertiary backups), client made put files back folder instead suggestion sort folders based date creation. explained software would break event another file got borked, it.

Thats hospital separate company hospital... get 6 charges 1 scan. privileged thing say. runny nose added? inefficient.

Otherwise, poors would one financing vaccine pharma would tempted ""experiment"" leading mistrust vaccine. dad lost job 17, company worked since 70ties, *I* almost died take care me. low paid position. 2006, America absolutely fucked long time.

And hate argument ""We need go lockdown safe!!"" No, - unless ignore lesser restrictions (distancing, masks, bar gatherings) case nunber go control yes, end needing another lockdown.

The people closures masks people whose actions making closures masks necessary People might say want it, many people going go movies? want go knock door, I'm there? mean mostly thread. guess easiest one brigade (though suspect there's genuine anti lockdown sentiment brewing among people super supportive six months ago). majority threads still March-esque. bizarrest thing going one seeing ""we self isolate end pandemic"" ""this going destroy everyone's mental health, lockdowns failure"" number upvotes. former coworker's mother covid ICU vent two months. lived. never able breathe without vent again.

It's getting ridiculous. 
You top voting annoying orange. reopened partially slowly tampering infection? actually, looking data happen clearly somewhere around early September/late August people must started spreading virus something changed far restrictions go. regardless, one country override findings entire planet, course historical data pandemics base basic simple decisions like on. Oh, great idea! Sheesh, least could let counties mandate masks. entire denial reality mentality, again.

And know turns out!  starting think fraud.. worked hard bring cases down, time reap reward efforts. ... Winnipeg Manitoba Canada! Covid spike masks mandatory everywhere small gatherings 10 allowed. I'm afraid grandkids schools reopened quite infections detected . you? polling places dangerous would better practices. Sorry sir realize America country earth matters? Would europe take u back? ""We pooled data 19 relevant COVID-19 studies included patients taking two particular types blood pressure medication: angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)."" Damn need book trip Covid directly cause death. far know ALWAYS something else. Coagulation, pneumonia, multi-organ failure, etc. know things happened? Covid! people (those say... FAT (or old gay black pink whatever excuse come moment)-not Covid) soooo disingenuous. uncomfortable mask get times, I‚Äôm start wearing one regularly flu season life gets back normal.

i'm planning allergy season Well, least stress losing health care since begin with? :-/ feel like spike bad. Even they're hospitalized (or especially they're not) may still going seeing people. people getting tested may go business spread anyways. 

Not mention learning cardiovascular damage COVID causes, potential long term damage even young people uncertain still. 

It's ""better safe sorry"" situation, think. Take precautions, isolate test symptoms. get it? Great! take precautions contact COVID, long term effects detrimental, affected, potentially impacted people contact with. take precautions get anyways, least minimizing chance someone getting you. 

Best case scenario little long term impacts COVID, that's looking likely. better cautious hopefully prevent others deal health consequences road.

The article spent lot time explaining vaccine help fully stop virus. get injected good. 

1) probably provide immunity year, meaning need yearly Covid shots like Flu shots. 

2) bar approval 50% effectiveness, means everyone injected, work intended half population (though realistically vaccines probably 70% effective range). 

3) also depends enough people taking vaccine country reach herd immunity. Around 66% need take work. 

All say dramatically lower Covid-19 levels. every days still read random outbreak one town city. likely regions low vaccine uptake rate. 

End day, mass vaccinations begin, end crisis mode. years (2022-2023) burn low level. disruptive economy, things like wearing mask football stadium anywhere packed people sensible. Asparagus? Trump know vegetable is. Maybe smelling like Big Macs cheesburders. dumb state. Florida 87 cases per 100,000 people last week average number cases United States whole (94).

Florida's deaths worse country but, deaths lagging indicator.

It's likely Florida's government gambling weather improving likely keep cases level consider acceptable even loosened restrictions.

Unlike much United States, Florida potentially position summer weather shot foot winter weather may cut cases.

The reality many Americans acceptable loss life health far higher we'd like believe preventing impacts one's pocketbook.  okay lmao 10% positive opening everything up?

Both middle pack, way. think portrayed like sell newspapers? spoil Trump's election chances? No. portrayed like really bad. Let's hope trickle reinfection cases turn flood, let's hope vaccines fail.  Hell, consider health impacts. may kill people overnight don‚Äôt mean opening everything mask free course least US, there‚Äôs little done address mental health, activity levels, preventative care seems quite clear creating also massive risks life come back next years decades response.

The problem something generous poor people many poor people. worry, I've informed past decades money definitely trickle everyone else! starters....what ***robust vigorous testing performed begin with?*** 

In many ways, answer matter---because government (Federal states) blew it. ship sailed, are.

But want say ""goalposts moved regarding masks,"" yes. have. win. 

Now put mask conduct business indoors, outside home. got incubated, luckily survived. 

I think mean ""intubated"" people Facebook write run sentences beg differ. understanding atm Australia accidental A+ jock atm; kid said something joke answer, teacher said 'completely right' thinking 'we actually this'. internal lockdowns chance eradicating followed real normality again.

If willing assertive, second wave screw economy again. Uh, well, except elephant room impossible control border USA, chance doomed anyways. Thank you. Fortunately seem getting well recovery, although one son still fatigued sleeping many hours day. extremely fortunate employer, already allows work home, gave hours specifically illness. 

I wish data support once, won‚Äôt get again! would make difference, case. Boss makes dollar, make dime. That‚Äôs I‚Äôm currently pooping company time Shit, even Mexico wants restrict Americans' access country. Well sounds like good idea.

Narrator: *It fact good idea.* sooner Covid stopped, sooner small businesses come back. People always need bars. crucial thing ending pandemic, whatever takes, rebuild. strategy China elsewhere East Asia took, worked. bars open now.  course did. damage done, many ways, human economic, worse virus.

The damage gets much, much worse without masks social distancing. Look Europe right got complacent. 


Open stuff up. Im ok that. enforce wearing masks social distancing Im saying. never learn it? 

Are you... serious?? major research announcements weekly, daily basis. last 24 hours I've seen articles attacking statins cholesterol connection training dogs give INSTANT nearly 100% accurate sniff test two completely random, top head items could major impacts.

This one researched science subjects decades.

Ask question say maybe 7 days gone substantial new insights. waiting awhile though. care. I‚Äôd rather see somebody carrying concealed [weapon] masking up.

 See somebody carrying concealed....

Isn't point concealed weapon others cannot see it? Right? Like weve also adopted different attitudes hookups pregnancy safe sex. 

No doubt HIV consideration suspect many people still believe choice partners enough stay safe regard (and odds lower 10 years ago too). According article reading minute ago, there's suggestions mask use helping cut initial viral load, hence resulting less severe cases could contributer well even real PERSON... let alone real doctor? understand too. Look, shutting things specific, short time frame slow things down. 

But damage done, many ways, human economic, worse virus. We, country, going struggle years afterwards. increases domestic violence, child abuse, suicides, mental health issues. None good. Nah. good. way long change. also lobbyists. Np; Canada's province population distribution hillarious first place. Flip coin: heads, Ontario; tails, literally everyone else. Contributes western alienation issue festering better part century really. It‚Äôs painful. hate living here. Possibly, least 6 categories (old-school deactivated, adenovirus spike transplant, adenovirus combo, mRNA, protein based, BCG) coming, would expect success failure mRNA ones linked other, also pretty different maybe not. success rates categories pretty much independent. count categories odds total failure 0.15 raised 5 (I'm going ignore BCG one think far-fetched) 0.0000759375 still really close zero. people still vote them. That‚Äôs exactly likes uneducated. How's Sweden corrupt? losing home food provide kids bad, 


As death? Clearly thinking straight. Oh ok. Makes sense. Apologies assuming Ontario. arrogant Ontarian thing do. Lol Agreed, although pond scum still better rest world has. course, like Polish Order Justice party running Canada, thank goodness xD need getting normal life back somehow smaller need poor ass joe across world? I'm literally talking small business owners, re-read wife/husband young old person home there‚Äôs need restrictions.

Big ol' fat yikes. First all, thing around less year, real idea long term ramifications infection are, that's reason enough play safe now, glaringly, infectious disease, actions impact countless people come contact many people day day basis. whether willing take risk extending risk taking onto everyone else. Overall Oregon still pretty well. They're currently 12.91 deaths per 100k. ranks 46th among states per capita here's latest case/death charts, running 7-day  one way isles stupid. need something end isle walk past twenty people get instead 2. increases total distance traveled. Academics: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt get people going bars meeting friends right risk, it‚Äôs irresponsible crazy.‚Äù

Uhhh, huge part world already trying go back close normal belief things much safer, less common?

I expression caution light switch solve anyone getting people, many home want that, need leave current bubble least like read posts people outside it. Many sub like face reality decision, Florida anywhere. real hard choice make. Anyone claims either side (shut vs. reopen) worth considering, someone perspective. hate guy year ending isn‚Äôt going solve everyone‚Äôs problems expect lessüòÑ Wanna hear again?? accountability, losing home food provide kids bad, gtfo that. Canadian borders staying closed LONG time. Virginia big diverse state ranging rur al densely populated suburban. never thrilled legislature finally tipped Democrats officially 2019. think way they've handled pandemic far perfect, way better states. least heavily populated Fairfax county, schools remain remote learning indefinitely. even put date might consider bringing students back in-person learning knew start school year brought back, we'd extended first wave includes seasonal flu. refuse call second wave would imply somehow got first one. not. risks mitigated. everyone chance getting back normal life. 

Not people running outside like nothing happened still sitting home still forced follow pandemic protocols somehow worthy. ""contractual obligation"" written stone. 

What? absolutely written stone unless party agrees amenable discussion. Getting millions shareholders agree this, within 3 months time, pipe dream. Literally counted, too. Wooooow comes tired ""any criticism Jewish person anti-Semitism"" trope. must miserable viewing life. genuinely feel sorry you. we're home, we've months, waiting safe us resume active lives. Watching anti-maskers think plandemic act like lives expendable we're either old, underlying conditions. Watching President pushing folks ""amazing healthy immune systems"" back normal life pandemic, hell rest us.  would shrug deaths like 200K, saying, ""Oh, health issues. gonna die eventually anyway. big deal.""  Yup, that's are. Build wall around Florida. indicted two people ran nursing home ""utterly baffling decisions made Walsh administrators allowed virus spread unchecked."" DeSantis next? fair, LOT alligators ands sharks. Jeepers might implement state income tax something? Front line healthcare workers get first, even he/she rich doctor.

And lets realistic, best make sure poor get vaccine. way get vaccine first. wrong, strategies shifted. Welcome like smart idea. one that's really much sacrifice. disagree?

You're literally trying argue goalposts shifting providing examples goalposts shifted. First Past Post. I'm Alberta, one communities actually chance conservatives could loose. NDP align values better, Trudeau still changed electoral system last checked, real choices Conservative Liberal.   not. peaked financial aid covid slow decline ever since two family members died far COVID.

How ""managing"" **pandemic** coming along? [Laughs rest world ... check graph Guardian, Europe drowning second wave Sweden immune already. Oh man. remember. fish. best friend, understood. good listener, sitting desk swimming compassionately...

Crazy? work everyday! ‡≤†_‡≤† think rise cases ultimately inevitable population become resistant restrictions. I‚Äôm really sure solution though, likelihood it‚Äôs going tough months globally. 0.02% 50 wtf?

And sub make virus seem like deadliest thing ever then? Ok. Good parents. 45, risk getting injured car accident way work Covid.

With driving, partly/mostly control, aware surroundings. bodies response contracting SARS-CoV-2, developing Covid-19, complete crap shoot, control. 

And yourself, depending actions, could negatively affect someone else's life, kill them. 

If interested pandemic, [This Week presented professors virology MDs, going since ~2008.

[Public Health [Healthcare Triage [Science good like learn too. 

All available multiple sources. depends definition ""working"" context?

But yeah, winter quite enlightening around. People Europe (well least UK case) getting resistant various restrictions. another lockdown necessary, think may coming weeks, could see protests en masse drive infection rate.

Either way, it‚Äôs looking bit doom gloom right now. Death rate twice declared look excess deaths metros Saying nobody cares USA accurate. takes small portion (which admittedly USA small portion) population undo good work. Also large number states mandatory mask use, spent 6 weeks USA saw many people complying mandates. course constantly frustrated not.

To seems USA places Europe enough people, even minority, cause growth cases. Humility, long-term planning, flexibility. dangers corruption political opportunism. Everything Sweden lacked caused 6000 dead. bias showing start, unfortunately. ""Restricted""? mean imprisoned. Secondly, plenty cases people tortured killed Chinese government speaking up.

I refute saying end, there's always merits argument, make stuff man? I've read, among staff UK hospitals, infection rate higher normal population. Vietnam war ended 45 years ago... argument talking today. 

Procure PPE... dude know much PPE go Red zone? really think totalitarian state creates second internet censors everything imprisons religious people act together, know tell you.

The presence virus measure getting act together. level personal responsibility get rid disease.

I fear either really naive form astroturfing totalitarian regime. Pay more. Anything less stupid. early signs working? Obviously winter, comes going decide good sustainable strategy not. Oh dear, *idiot‚Ñ¢* US POTUS, ""advised"" SHIT. That's lack class can't taught. short, society governed religion money

by consumerism, never-ending ""growth"" 

unable anything sacrifice human lives altar ""the economy""

proven woefully inadequate even confront covid, really would *wear fucking masks* -- fuck supposed confront climate change society?

no, either something different, days severely numbered. Oh snap, calling guy common.. damn! That's good point low-density areas Nordic countries. absolutely right people ignore fact discussing Sweden handling epidemic. work exactly? Even architects behind strategy saying along can't know sure ""works out"" maybe year way early conclude something like that. live Paris people still dining restaurants partying apartments. required masks obviously used there. Also, see plenty folks parks sitting right beside benches talking masks pulled down. can't really say mandatory masks work enforced followed w/ many private gatherings dinner parties. worry comment removed nobody able know. would search community health agencies area contact via email ask could donate services local you. usually position dedicated charitable work called development officer.

Agencies kids love receiving toys gifts around holidays. problem, seems like us talking ‚Äúdon‚Äôt let ship sink‚Äù kind people it‚Äôs sustainable. loved job year ago. hate life second leave house morning second cross threshold evening. counted imported cases.

The whole town tested think 2 days ago, negative. Letting spread offers good solution either. someone actually gets Swedish news, here's things people often ignore talking Sweden's strategy:

Mobility down, drastic neighbours, still considerably compared normal.

Economy took similar hit neighbours lockdown.

As long hospitals dont become oversaturated, everything mostly ""fine"", problem (which lockdowns meant for, also meant medical professionals figure effective treatment strategies).

What works low population density Nordics, dense hubs far separated one another, necessarily work densely populated blue banana EU.

Sweden compares often direct neighbours news (which correct comparison say US/Sweden love do). look nearly successful context; aware officials times expressed regrets approach.

In end, winter still coming, herd immunity still reached Sweden. We'll able tell season respiratory illness reigns king, strategy actually paid out, it'll take larger retrospective study analyse applied densely populated regions. Hm, I've seen comment situation Russia many posts, posting worldometer, talking Russia ""not control"", ""being desperate"" ""second wave"".

Considering use ""they"" think Russia, so, pure curiosity, makes obsessed(?) Russia? Cool... idea wealth ""money"". 
Mine's ""food, healthcare, cheap housing, education"". ""poor French"" eats better ""middle class American"". endless calls one complaints. horrific frustrating part tried something slow pandemic, believe pandemic provide nice data public-health specialist measure work don't. Seeing rises mandatory mask restriction compared US nobody cares make doubt ""Science technology first productive forces"" - Deng Xiaoping areas? see 4 regional first waves honestly think Sweden's neighbors catch Sweden much better treatment options, good routines elderly care homes, enough protective equipment on?

That's silly.

Sweden nothing let virus run wild. use kn95 think sketchy. one 2 months Yes. think good idea long term mitigations. Now, could course also need harder shorter term mitigations (When hospital capacity \*is\* overwhelmed, ideally - choice). need go back mitigations sustainable.

More importantly, mitigations need accepted followed people \*want to\*. can't police population stand 2m apart wash hands stay home work sick. never going effective compared population actually \*wants\* it. bit harder though need trust public institutions/experts/politicians that's something countries quite deficit (Italy, US, example). use hazmat suit costume safe halloween.. exactly society broken COVID? I‚Äôm essential don‚Äôt cry soul. Yeah poster epitome ""misery loves company"". us happy pre-pandemic y'know. Yeah, least hoped would detail things China would acceptable ""Western democracy"".

I think better stop. isnt really fair argument. news, like, already known February? Okay, might ‚Äúscientifically true‚Äù.

But let tell you, nobody cares shit. boss doesn‚Äôt care I‚Äôm feeling weak need rest, says come work anyways. doesn‚Äôt care hardly get bed, still gotta get make money. Growing it‚Äôs shit, gotta strong go school, men don‚Äôt get sick. thing sports, give weakness heat exhaustion dehydration people gonna make fun enough. 9+ months away; regards planning. reliance vacation dollars instead income taxes. media says unemployment 8% assume posts deletion result corrupt pseudo science mod? That‚Äôs childish likely reason. 

There thousand realistic reasons posts probably removed. There‚Äôs conspiracy silence others. know man. Cmon.   postpones epidemics little.

Since treatment disease possibility vaccine gets better time, make big difference. 

People getting earlier worse people getting later. I, along many others former company, furloughed zero pay March laid August 3rd, first business day CARES Act stipulations expired (end July). company stated emails able pay furloughed employees‚Äô health insurance thanks government funding. However, terminated employees received zero severance company extended health insurance coverage end August forcing us find coverage worst global health crisis century. 

I‚Äôm almost 100% certain it‚Äôs coincidence company keep us payroll end July secure funding telling us fuck off. 

This private company; study focuses publicly-trader companies, shows tip iceberg. United States America dead. boss took almost 2 million PPP loans. owns 5 retail mechanic shops wholesale distribution center said auto parts. considered critical business. closed single day pandemic. steady cash flow extra $2 million free cash, easy spend money workers, right? Well, annual raise reviews (if ask him, never remembers) already told two people work getting raises ""It's unknown time know things look like months."" told told.

So, annual review start November thing is, beat month date numbers across board every single month since April. currently 4% PROFIT wholesale almost 10% retail year date. purchased one new 18ft two new 16ft box trucks well new pickup truck deliveries. Yet, pretty sure get raise either. GM one stores let go ""rumor mill"" insisted raise due stores increased volume turned threatened quit.... owner fired him.

All PPP take tax money employees paying give right back him, free.  flu shot isn‚Äôt great prevention, it‚Äôs really good reducing mortality rates. I.E. may still get sick, won‚Äôt get nearly sick. initial vaccines close it‚Äôll huge, since treat better beginning answer slogans, address points made, beyond handwriting away.

So saying large amount companies, likewise large amount fraud?

Instead loftily telling learn statistics, actually spell position? Seems like actually point, able state it. bout diverting church money people live humanely Schools don‚Äôt function certain percentage staff sick. opened less 3 weeks ago already dealing problems lack staff. Also, hope brother doesn‚Äôt get neurological heart issues later life. immediate symptoms ‚Äúlike flu‚Äù may concerned about. daughter goes school person masks social distancing.

This... allowed anywhere. don‚Äôt agree it‚Äôs tied hospitals collapsing, nearly NYC, think people stay home. I've posted thought reply someone comments, I'm trying pass idea many people possible maybe safe Hallowe'en trick treating year. So, here's idea had, hope helps safe Hallowe'en year:

I racking brain try work safe way without direct contact kids; figure putting bowl outside work everyone would still hands going bowl best, whole bowl might taken one go worst. 

&amp;#x200B;

I lucky enough live location small yard 12 14 foot stretch fence; I'd thinking would buy candy Hallowe'en bags put together kids, glove mask put together (and may get tricky make 1/2 non-peanut, peanuts, clearly marking difference) start. try stringing lines across fence yard decorate like spider web (complete fake spiders such) clip bags throughout 'webbing'. figure, way watch front window costume staying safe inside, make sure one takes many own, kids walk see they're brave enough face spider web bag candy.

&amp;#x200B;

I've trying put forth idea much possible half see anyone spot flaws plan, half see may still Hallowe'en year enough people join idea (whether way version it). google problem exactly justifiable legal perspective. entire system built justify keeping new wealth one tier population

Saying ""well theyre contractually obligated give government grants rich shareholders"" kind hand waving problem. fact say choice problem - choice likely would done thing get act like hands tied

And example 'super clean corp' perspective small company owner something. reality, major decision leaders public companies compensation decided stock price. Even best interests corporation buy back stock(instead using hiring expansion raises keep valuable employees), executive might 5 year career company every incentive use funds buy back stock directly increases personal take home pay

Regardless, nothing going change richer get richer poor/middle class stagnate least we'll able tell fine moral technically legal

ugh surprised. Success determined choices. unlike lot people believe think determined much money make. believe successful able something truly enjoy happy it. Even means barely able pay rent, happy, successful.

Nothing. people care human lives ones cared pandemic, continue care afterward. Today, wear masks try limit contact people. thing people realize yes, *really infuriating* try take precautions others flagrantly endanger others. People exhausted, tempers short.

socialism = dictatorship proletariat w/ state-capitalist monopoly serves masses first foremost

*For huge capitalist undertaking becomes monopoly, means serves whole nation. become state monopoly, means state (i.e., armed organisation population, workers peasants all, provided revolutionary democracy) directs whole undertaking. whose interest?*

*Either interest landowners capitalists, case revolutionary-democratic, reactionary-bureaucratic state, imperialist republic.*

*Or interest revolutionary democracy‚Äîand step towards socialism.*

*For socialism merely next step forward state-capitalist monopoly. Or, words, socialism merely state-capitalist monopoly made serve interests whole people extent ceased capitalist monopoly.*

V.I. Lenin, Impending Catastrophe Combat It

socialism mean bailouts, especially bourgeoisie. that's capitalism working intended. serving capital, functioning intended. corporatism (what seem alluding to), total merger corporation state, actually one substitute terms fascism given mussolini, makes sense, given fascism capitalism decay. Lol luxury taxes never worked ever Everything say right on. thought ""pumping fake numbers"" referring 1.35M deaths worldwide, meant fake COVID-19 numbers. completely agree. Kind weird, browsed post history bit (not sure really) wanted say I'm page therapeutics treatment angle. vaccine pipe dream needs time, challenge vaccinating (a coronavirus, first history) safety/speed issue.

That's answer. wife work health, go work istay home children's. Two times get respiratory symptoms, times get tested negative. Two month ago started new job get antibody test weekly first test came positive, new pcr came negative


We going get test except need something like work travel (and right now).

There clear yet patients get permanent immunity, ease case, lowering care put risk people contact. so, now, keep social distancing, without unnecessary encounters. realize even Swedish government denied herd immunity strategy, spreading misinformation.

Also, there's feel like complaining clean toilets...

Sure piss sterile...

You really know missing someone stops cleaning toilets. Automod incorrect here. Florida highest death rate country over. 2022 u real doctor? low children deaths? What‚Äôre talking about? You‚Äôre addressing opinion separate subject related article didn‚Äôt want read article wanted say something irrelevant headline. .02% (generously rounding up) human population. Wow, can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm reading something like this... would that? Makes angry Sending good wishes job search general! politician free healthcare wants open state's economy political gain?


Shocking, shocking . worries. definitely trial vaccine poor people give rich people. country wears masks, that's saying. semantic distinction, showed irrelevant. Please learn read go circles (easier spam reply 1 minute).

You wrong Belgium Italy counterexamples argument argued strawman Sweden's healthcare. Amnesia again?

No, one going *sources*. That's *you* *you*. *source*?  know, people angry bad legislation companies bullshit. ...that sounds like covid flu, though flu joke. (Most ""flu"" bad cold, real flu mess up.) asking question answered decently strong correlation poverty bad covid outcomes. Perhaps that's he's referring to.

What happen likely people got access sooner testing (celebrities, sports figures, politicians) get access vaccine first comes out. Imagine world people actually risk got first. would nice. sure. family-owned business options leaving. We've applied hundreds hundreds jobs since March nothing panned yet. Maybe soon things get better! ""average"" income masked fact universal healthcare even good healthcare many ppl worth like billions upon billions. Jeff Bezos alone pulls average net worth americans %.

Oh wow... think net worth impacts income average Canadian lives better life average American

As someone lived countries, unlike you, would love see data set used derive conclusion. would assume NZ would see -12.2% drop Q3? Even article states economists expect record jump back growth Q3 they've re-opened since think anyone definitively say countries come better point.

Right, data shows NZ suffered slightly worse drop GDP gained via exceedingly low number cases/deaths. certainly can't tell future, would say that's worth based know now. keep hoping walking parking lot, I'll get hit car enough damage get couple weeks leave, nothing permanently damaging lol lol - *think* done. 

You guaranteed share things like strangers. 

 Next time smell fart, guess humid air been.

Life gross. I‚Äôll honest, I‚Äôm uk idea applied ppp certify couldn‚Äôt get funds elsewhere. Also ton rules regulations spend ppp money. don‚Äôt follow pay ppp back. I've never really implied smart, smart way advertise easiest, whoever isnt smart position moment Maybe day they'll figure technology phones home work home. ""Hope important, recognising successes vital, especially pandemic. presenting current situation India positive spin clouds reality also hampers vital public health initiatives. Perpetuating unrealistic claims failing honestly report negative news creates uncertainty among public health-care professionals, discouraging people taking preventive action taking public health messages seriously. India expertise medicine, public health, research, manufacturing lead nation COVID-19 pandemic. capitalise attributes, country's leaders must respect scientific evidence, expert commentary, academic freedom, provide false optimism.""

This argument still important healthy fear respect virus. may unhealthy fear (owning shit), think enough people, especially USA, taking seriously all. That's still stay home. everyone wore mask, might feel safer vaccine. (likely never), still stay home protect keep hospitals yet another potential patient. I'm sure true many underdeveloped countries even 1/10th test capacity pr. capita richer countries. agree 100% Ugh many reading word letters We're 1000 deaths day 7-day moving average. 

I'll admit, wrong April thought beginning month predictions 50,000 deaths overblown. like 60,000 deaths. man, even knowing done past seem many things better can't see happening again. predictions WORSE. see it.  Sounds like lock fun. Say hello second wave. Fuck man :( I'm sorry Immunity limited Covid-19, unfortunately. people don‚Äôt produce many antibodies think argument ""Letter law vs spirit law"" argument.

This put SBA.... ""Small Businesses"". Specifically called business without ""access liquid sources liquidity."" us thought public companies would instantly ineligible that. fact weren't... well, I'll argue political.

It going come office audits start happening IMHO happens companies article. want, PM year so, I'll let know audit goes.

Lastly, Ecolab 50k employees really going get PPP loan. already posted actual article different comment.  imagine it‚Äôs also helpful people batch routinely exposed other. way, makes sense preemptively quarantine everyone. Flagrant misinformation ""94% died something else"" conspiracy theory. anecdotal evidence apparently proves everything wrong want wrong.

Imagine evidence masks working knew guy wear mask gotten COVID.  thing. Yeah that's kind mortal works think I‚Äôd Belgium, Netherlands, Spain, France, UK, Peru, USA?

No one countries let virus run wild. It‚Äôs virus. spreads itself. we're testing new vaccines poor now? That‚Äôs interesting correlation. bad seems zero impact behavior someone personally impacted. God help us dealing climate change. Hahaha 6 months test turn around time 24 hours , it‚Äôs disgrace get benefits grocery store job, part-time full-time eligible. makes harder quit... nah makes sense bruh, got 100 million people group take symptomatic people, say 20 million 80% test positive, thats gonna high positive % tests done, positive cases general place 10 million people, 5 miollion tests people symptoms showing 40% positive rate. 


 
that doesnt mean USA failed way cases.. biased way looking data, live Canada, hate Trump hes joke. hes right one dude.. figure means lol. say 'mandems really bad eh, pull tha stick eh bruv' ur gonna assume random shit xD stop fucking ignorant understand there's rush go back business usual comes schools, pandemic perfect time completely rethink schooling start retooling. Sure, there's way they'd completely ready now, there's plenty time lay ground work. certain political party certainly seems pro-virus. anything. Fuckin toadaso don't. ""Slow testing please!"" Fuck stop posting shit like this. holding vax done life must go whether like not. pretty common see 10k cards. declined yesterday buying car. ""average"" income masked fact universal healthcare even good healthcare many ppl worth like billions upon billions. Jeff Bezos alone pulls average net worth americans %.

the average Canadian lives better life average American point, we're way past reasonable time things shut down. causing harm virus would originally. [archive link anyone trouble accessing article No, all. neither best interests mind. fact many people diehard believers us vs real problem.

It's really us. Americans. need work together long people hear side debate get fixed.

Edit: like right said side great, least side. People sides say get nowhere. Generally agree. Helicopter money basically tax everyone increase inflation. seen Belarus president prints money give law enforcement ineffective state owned factories. Health care centre's calls nightmare. 4 year college level education nursing public health, expecting able help people. Instead shortage doctors, work consisted mostly coming alternative solutions reasons someone booked appointment. Sometimes could say see GP anything available call later. mention supposed take 8-12 calls hour; fine someone renewing prescription mother calls adult child locked apartment threatening jump balcony... I've never felt powerless miserable. PPP loan funds divided equally sent individuals/families filed taxes last year. money would hit economy quicker helped people... companies maintain payroll 2 months keeping employees anyway. CARES Act trickle Reagan bullshit...  started wonder recently first country launch nukes Someone side paywall tell us companies offload boycott [I read charges recently methods calculating PPP loan amounts available common one #2 many times gonna keep falling giving companies money? can‚Äôt. pass away run strength keep alive. That‚Äôs kind thinking passed me. That's reddit, every topic child's last resort, fingers ears screaming ""no you"".

Yes, are. No, telling truth. dishonest. making honest claim spreading misinformation. case, could simply lead example provide source claim, question, speculation, rhetorical bad faith question (given *context* important distinction), Denmark overtaken Sweden. provide source factual statement. easy. choose deny reality waste time escape hatch lost argument, asking something evidently find unreasonable yourself.

You refuse, strategy desperately backtrack failed strawman argument Italy Belgium. process, appear *massive* hypocrite, making claims language understanding (you misread first comment), dishonesty (you made strawman argument Sweden's healthcare), paying attention context (which ignoring currently).

Yet another loss pro Tegnell side. many hypotheses right now... watching people learn new disease real-time trip. is. original posted yesterday removed moderators unclear reason. edit: nevermind, clicked wrong link. weirdo guy Except whole fact people couldn‚Äôt support many businesses time PPP loans made government shut down. completely missed point also seem quite ignorant majority PPP funds used. MANY small businesses completely saved due MANY jobs saved well continue provide income whole lot people. program abused certain larger companies funds probably shouldn‚Äôt doesn‚Äôt change anything I‚Äôve written subject. wait...I'm responsible happens me? sound right, think someone else fix issues.  CIA bots, really? Receiving money government pay payroll bills capitalism.

It socialism corporations. Literally banks government choosing companies win die.

Capitalism exists cryptocurrencies yet used many. still fucking understand fuck give money directly workers

Stimulus payments happened, massive unemployment boosts happened, calm down. specifically familiar protocol, that's exactly thought reading article - new groundbreaking, standard care many hospitals point. Thanks link! MLB, NBA, NFL manage keep COVID locker rooms.. means spit tests viable option keep COVID schools offices.

This kind fatally flawed though. NBA playing bubble they're actually enforcing bubble rules. MLB already failed several times prevent covid we've seen couple outbreaks. I'm honestly shocked seen anything NFL there's players much closer contact. Amen. Voting important always going matter sure election actually matter.  right vote attacked fronts even every single person country eligible vote mean election can't stolen.  RBG's death makes way likely Trump remain office especially able get SCOTUS pick seated election.  I'm fine voting plan think need solid plan B work. 2030 Narrator: held accountable. Since 200K touted success anything less 2 million deaths seems acceptable. emotions slogans answer. Again, fraudulent cases always found many companies US. would wear mask celebrating holidays alone? make sense me. like virus gone away. wife gets tested suffice us? live together alone home don‚Äôt time capacity get tested. She‚Äôs going today. comes back negative would safe assume neither us it? symptoms haven‚Äôt contact anyone that‚Äôs Depending antibiotics chosen, many also direct anti-inflammatory actions well. There‚Äôd devastating second wave Winter, Americans willing support permanent mask mandates future. 

I see people continuing use till vaccine widely available, possibly 3-12 months distribution safe that, don‚Äôt see many people continuing use them. 

Some people older, pre-existing conditions, and/or immunocompromised might wear flu season precautionary measure, healthy young middle age people likely won‚Äôt comply all. imply we‚Äôre second wave? 

TBH don‚Äôt know tell since doesn‚Äôt seem like ever got first wave. hate job. hate job take steps towards making happier finding want life :)  holds true 100% world.

THE hardest-hit country deaths per million (Peru) tried follow strategy Western countries without realizing big chunk population needs streets/markets earn money + there's thing unemployment benefits + population little trust authority + socializing big part culture.

Naturally, economy one tanked worst South America + lockdown strategy failed.

Every country thought makes sense population (like Sweden did) instead copy/pasting China's lockdown strategy shaming ""lIsTeN sCienCe"". really kick-off Feb/Mar 2020, there's 2,5 months there.   - simple enough do, isn;t done? OH ya, NATIONAL PLAN propose controversial drastic viewpoint:

Not people disagree bots. Yep. class making plans go ban anyway, what's worse, planning inside instead park like times. read article? article claiming opposite, article says almost 1 billion people caught virus globally officially \~1 million died unofficially maybe high \~2 million died meaning virus, incredibly contagious, deadly thought. treating workers better would good solution, point take care stop hoping people going start treating better. Everyone control lives think. lot easier blame system work actually make progress towards making happier. Fuck Rob Manfred fuck universal DH. get works, that's we're complaining it. Oh wow, another article discusses rising case counts says nothing completely flat death toll. originally ended post ‚ÄúI read article says hand washing doesn‚Äôt help‚Äù



That‚Äôs referring to



Don‚Äôt miserable. course wash hands. Agreed. people ‚Äúasses accept risk‚Äù social, even bubbles, virus perpetuated longer we‚Äôre locked up. 

I wish answer people suffering lack social interaction. I‚Äôm depressed I‚Äôve ever myself. Life sucks right now. it‚Äôs question one marshmallow two later. going take popcorn watch CCP CIA bots fight other. confusing ‚Äúsome cases‚Äù ‚Äúall them‚Äù. statistics much money actually paid employees vs much money gone stock market? number companies US economy, *all* possible cases found.
I don‚Äôt statistics, expect wast majority money gone workers. I‚Äôm glad hear you‚Äôre getting better deal next job. Good luck career! saw this. really wanna let cry happen im mentally drained life, politics, job, pandemic etc im fucking tired everything feel like stan southpark episode saw everything everyone literal shit this, dont support trump think hes dumbass, clearly reworded make sense. Hes clearly saying reason say 80% tests come back positive becuase theyre directly testing people showing symptoms.  
and theyve done tests anyone else itll come positive cases. 


dudes kinda right. funny af - lucky ones die survive potential lifelong side effects COVID. Ya, got 205,000 dead americas million far survived issues? studies data likely outcomes. example, 100 people exposed, 50 show signs have, 50 others slight severe reactions 1 2 deaths another 20 type lifelong/longterm conditions? data ignoring it? Thats REAL travesty especailly america could easily little access medical care insurance future ""ThEy'Ll eNd tAxiNG eVeRyTHiNg!""

See, play, too. Wow stupid Every article every single thing.

The death rate lower thought.  That's good.  Or, many us think good.  Others oddly annoyed, disappointed, decide true bunch people died nursing home somewhere. Last point pretty important. course numbers Q2 going look awful think they‚Äôll bounce back well, least better countries.  Lol you‚Äôre writing response nothing. it‚Äôs worth statement describes left right used feel physically sick went work can't remember amount times cried.

We worked 7pm 3:30am 1pm 9:30pm US, busiest shift.

I quit year ago still anxiety. What's worst, feel wek quitting. Like toughed endured. people could me? tell future employer? weak take random people taking shit? weird situation - know need go back work dread time. ""Rate"" Ebola deadly disease though. Dichotomy ‚Äúthe rich‚Äù others, lad. class-based thinking. Maybe people want something look forward besides endless Zoom calls Netflix binges? money wasn‚Äôt raises, pay employees short period time Remember. less individual companies ‚Äúshitty‚Äù legal obligations corporations shareholders.

THAT obligation shareholders employees/the community/ general interest public needs fixed order anything else get better. Trump's covid plan. plan led graveyard pic. reason people see either/or that‚Äôs government telling them. state county mask mandates (and lots mandates I‚Äôve looked at) literally say ‚Äúmasks shall worn social distance 6 feet cannot maintained.‚Äù

Can really fault average person obeying exactly mask mandate says? Whatever happened let local governments decide? Miami went stage 2 weeks ago, ready full blown reopen? Doesn‚Äôt make sense. Twice day. Classes different people between. Short periods passing people hallways. person gets first sits front, everyone goes passed them. many variables. least countries Ebola outbreaks used mask, social distancing contact tracing.  country trying copy anyone doomed fail. virus political everything else is, affects believes country government politicians. Look China started. anyone believe kind strict lockdown welding front door peoples houses good idea? Yea people mostly good everywhere unique phenomena America. nationalistic would defend 1a life, instead defending one tell someone get fuck out. People shit whatever like that's free speech called recreational bitterness, that's covered 1A un-American pos. ... true society-wide. Fair warning antibodies part equation anyway.

It‚Äôll left porch, I‚Äôll transfer proper plating probably won‚Äôt eating tonight maybe even tomorrow. I‚Äôll hear oven restrictions prevent leaving house things per normal?

Also, I'll point health experts across EU attribute people breaching social distancing (via things like holding large parties congregating bars beyond recommended capacity) large cause second wave. want less restrictions, start asking people follow guidelines. tithing. collection plate full people beleive pandemic. pretty much exact opposite Jesus said do.

As Netherlands, dramatically better Sweden. excess mortality 59 / 100k (as Aug 23), whilst Sweden 52 (as Aug 11). thus **worse**. Currently.

Last week, eldest's school told us infection. name, identification class teacher, etc.


Just ""we tell you, one case, contact, kid school, no, tell is"".


Then protocol:
- one case: tell you
- cases one class: kids class schooled home
- cases one class: school closed, everybody distance learning.


It's simple that... idea people keep saying 'we'll see happens' posit worst outcome NZ. sheer force will. Like working don‚Äôt collapse. Ever worked shift case flu? Put body mind hell you‚Äôre fortunate enough wake days later.

I want give ebola see mentally power It‚Äôs time we‚Äôre back 100% I'd recommend getting flu vaccine maintaining social distancing masking. Getting flu could weaken immune system unnecessarily alluded to, might wind spreading either vulnerable individuals. 

Out genuine curiosity, parents opposed vaccination? Yep..there's Let guess, sub won‚Äôt celebrating one certain letter next name. hate people reduce ""wow wont people wear mask social distance"".

You're asking people go school. go work. Potentially lose jobs like millions already. see friends family. enjoy hobby. travel. on.

THAT'S majority people problem with. know people like act like anti-maskers way bigger deal are. see single one country. However people getting tired things mentioned.

When people tell ""oh might lose job, also see people. Also cancel vacation. Also go eat. Also really anything except sit home"" maybe i'm reluctant that's selfish. 
Sorry, it‚Äôs Portuguese. basically says Manaus adopted strict measures due increasing infections. Unions vilified decades companies exploited that. CIA doesn‚Äôt type corporate access us companies like China theirs. Herd immunity seriously. friend tell pointing Trump taking apart USPS machines suppress vote ""chugging Kool Aid"" posted Dems throwing ballots ramping steal election. They've gotten deep peoples' minds really project anything Trump onto Dems bro cat

I'm chill bro ls offended brought victim gondii fact gondii negatively impacted life. every person cat dog

Yeah right dogs get gondii compare both. crazy cat woman ü§£ü§£

Its good bro I'm sure never job due brain injury ü§£ü§£ least one lose. 

Also gondii serious kills kids quite easily makes people impulsive less intelligent (e.g you) 
I linked article highlights dangers gondii im sure avoiding like plague.... definitely think placed bubble locked basement everyone else's well being. please take serious test cat. cat (im sure tgondii makes think different.) great move, love living FL. Anyone thinks going lead kind case explosion fool. That's insignificant amount compared fatality rate COVID let alone similar non-fatal effects narcolepsy.

Any scientific evidence back up? supposed to. Get vote anyone else. Vote em (will need 4-8 years depending awful replacements least current bunch actively allowing happen gone) . Nothing change leave old crusty bastards office. Absolutely legal complete bullshit. Companies could take PPP loan forgiven used payroll, rent, utilities etc. don‚Äôt use that, repayment low interest rate grand total 1%. buyback stocks now, increase stock price loan rate you‚Äôll never able get open market. stock market gets artificially inflated bump, tax cuts led historic stock buybacks. benefits shareholders (and predominantly wealthy, though may save 401k small hit). Meanwhile, funds used small businesses able get privately owned Uber rich supposed benefit getting assistance? Yeah, rich, work smarter, harder, work all. Threats public health officials really getting attention. Iran-tier stuff, come US era Trump. blatantly obvious. Ventilation systems jails configured filter aerosol droplets spread Covid. Also group recreation areas condensed space provides inadequate social distancing.

Also public leaders attempted fix problem initiating early release non-violent offenders. strategy backfired horribly since prisoners deliberately infecting means get jail. New Zealand total 15 critical cases June 15 today, last 3 months New Zealand **1 death last 3 months**, Sweden **over 500 deaths** last 3 months going pick-up careful kind venue is. Buddy went pick order hot chicken joint number ppl standing line masks noses ppl yard away other, inadequate distancing. think safe canceled told eatery why. death count higher reported well. course know infected we've tested, excess death rate much, much higher covid death counts well. harsh lock testing _everyone_ _entire_ city still active cases (and you‚Äôre tested positive get quarantined cared), basically virus eradicated (at least among human) mainland China community spread, virus can‚Äôt live long without inside carrier. Also China quarantining _every single person_ who‚Äôs entering China, matter what‚Äôs citizenship, 14 days (that‚Äôs see ‚Äúimported cases‚Äù reported, showed symptoms 14-day quarantine travel China). preventive processes constantly taken, ways virus China think are:
1. Smugglers, case Xinjiang‚Äôs outbreak months ago Ruilin‚Äôs recent cases.
2. Imported frozen food/products since virus stay alive surface frozen products. Workers might touch nose mouth touching surfaces get infected. basically case Beijing Xinfadi outbreak recent Qingdao virus carrier. pattern infection also previously found case New Zealand. prevent case happening causing community spreading, China regular checkups high-exposure workers, including frozen food workers, doctors/nurses, etc., roughly every two weeks. case found, again, carrier gets quarantined cared, degrees close contacts get tested, maybe another entire-city testing.
3. virus still exists animals. part hard control, strictly follow process human patient found, wait scientists figure animal(s) carries virus.

Plus, almost people China (I wanted say everyone, know case - always outliers no-brainers) know virus spreads control it, nearly one decide go hospital show symptoms, since people know hiding way get rid it. People learnt hard way early year.

With preventions, mainland China pretty much becomes huge bubble, like one NBA Orlando much much larger scale. People live bubble almost get back normal life, COVID hot topic anymore (though people China still talking bad COVID situation US countries). People focusing daily work, economy growth, go wherever want, meet whoever wish to.

I guess summarize, China following science, listening scientists, acting quickly strictly following process, controlled fashion. steps can‚Äôt control virus, doubt virus controlled working vaccine. Probably lot countries people living China don‚Äôt believe virus controlled waiting miracle vaccine rescue, reason country controlled well, get ashamed start smearing country &lt;shrug virus smart 23 bar target you. long order food beer otherwise also target cuz 'Rona like booze without food. time snowbirds arrive back. isn‚Äôt 99% people wearing masks socially experts across EU literally attribute people breaching social distancing holding parties large gatherings bars large reason second curfews, visiting people, work restrictions etc. things really affect peoples lives people right annoyed about.

Lol. fuck? honestly thought insightful comment? think ‚Äúburned out‚Äù? areas 30% people died (meaning many infected) damn hard infected people infect anyone else (since people around either died immune prior infection). That‚Äôs called herd immunity. think better testing overtake need vaccines point. Testing easily confirmed work side effects. needs scaled made cheaper. cheap tests done home, start testing everyone regularly. hand cannot know sure effective vaccine side effects (especially long-term side-effects) available.

Of course, medicine expert, concluding observation knowledge industrial processes - scaling thing usually easier developing completely new thing. rare Communism without massive corruption top.

This old chestnut..

Because capitalism completely, 100% corruption free top amiright Broad benefits need broad tax bases. VAT *should* applied basically everything. want pay taxes stuff, really want benefit. wrong Technically, death sign, symptom. symptom (often subjective) observation made patient. sign objective measurement (often made professional). example, feeling short breath symptom, low O2 saturation sign.

So unless people going doctor saying ""Doc, I'm feeling like mild case death"", we'll classify death signs, symptoms. I‚Äôm professor spent many years getting education could change world teacher, researcher, author. There‚Äôs nothing brave stealing petty cash plastic straws small business. go patting back revolutionary slinging Bud Light 20 years. sure showed them! ‚Äúnormal‚Äù job sales manager generally stuff negotiating rates businesses organizations. Covid made us lay enough people start working front desk shifts. started hotels college worked front desk realized something wanted long term switched sales. Pandemic kind fucked that. Sure, whatever helps sleep night bud. absolutely way admit anything Reddit, that's expected.

Peace. Vitamin C? Really? 
How many patients treated far? hope admitting ones haven‚Äôt died, sake study results.  live suburbs. tons progressive people, time ton people seem forget Ohio part Union. Hell, live county Sherman from, still see stars bars. people wearing masks, though. might even people going bars weekends.

It‚Äôs strange dichotomy. Convertible weather extending bit later usual year I've able drive around top down, generally one high points day. Difference flu never gets control like covid has. already explained this. lying say, ""Dont achieve certain outcome"" know ""that"" works. Whether exacerbating factors irrelevant. least publicly name companies. actually super positive news 1 year ahead schedule; best case scenarios.

Most inoculate herd immunity programs processed first year 35-43% total community. maximum time-frame eligibiltiy due things like age, giving birth, death etc - puts initial eligibility counts towards 83% maximum variable. (mean 69%, due increased mortality rates.)

After take 2-3 years complete herd immunity; innoculation threshold. Yeah, governments way looking people via stimulus packages lockdown.

Also, vast majority workers issue wearing mask countries re-opened. What's excuse everyone else then? special US bashing, every corner internet someone pissing favorite flavor Cherrios. come Reddit high frequency see streams piss, find piss streams anywhere hang there. want welfare state, need middle class pay, like functional European countries. Yeah way say...

‚ÄúHey people literally pay 4000-6000 thousand month pocket, like don‚Äôt need extra help they‚Äôre fine. Please go help ACTUAL poor people‚Äù

Flu season around year plus sick would wear (unlike covid totally control *all* wear protect other)

It would better focused reality continued do, instead worrying whether stranger internet thinks ‚Äúhick‚Äù fly country. plenty ‚Äúhicks‚Äù country (and even ‚Äúhicks‚Äù take seriously). repay PPP loans? breaks. lot places auto-answer phone, done one client, there's another right away line. Lot's micro-managing too, calls timed &amp; tracked &amp; recorded. boss frequently pull aside ask particular call twenty minutes long, close call upselling something else customer now? 

So picture working never-ending line customers grocery checkout, boss right behind timer &amp; conversation recorder, stopping wish give criticism. incredibly soul crushing go 8 hrs day, usually abismal pay &amp; benefits. 

Oh, also, customers 90% angry start, taking frustrations majority time. ""your job"" put de-escalate situation. companies give front line call workers little resources actually help customer, hoping they'll able get customer ""let go"", get frustrated enough hang up. 

My experience comes working call centers extremely large companies. mutiple instances, ""customer de-escalation role"" upset customers wronged. often given ridiculous expectations make certain number sales poor folks also giving away little resources possible fix issues, extremely frustrating!

If could change anything, it'd call center workers need higher pay, shorter hours. work 6 hr shifts, 5-4 days week, paid competitive amount. Also, hourly breaks 5 minutes. 

These places end revolving doors, workers one day realizing can't take another day stress, never come back work.

I claim call centers pay anywhere near that, job union, utility.

But even lowest paying call center position $16/hr 6 years ago. Weekends count. Even 8 hours day (it 6) 33%

No. comparing social situations providing positive example personal resilience. kids going way behind socialization routine. want elementary school kids able sit still study standardized testing lol making feel better this. wrong. Flu IFR 0.02% worst, makes covid much dangerous anyone around 30. say duh... people legitimately believe virus non-issue massively overblown. seriously, new thing spout bullshit 6% cases real, reality number cases someone died directly COVID-19 without another cause death. world full dumbasses, lol... scale worst finding 2020 we... please this? Please? Saying cases increasing deaths staying flat ridiculous statement. past 9 months we've watched increased deaths COVID lag behind positive case increased 4-6 weeks. that's long takes someone die virus.

Looks like cases began increasing somewhere around mid late July, spiking happening mid-August, around 5 weeks ago. spike deaths. Got another seem upset getting downvoted, came sub clearly taking COVID seriously, (NOT HYSTERICALLY)

Oh actually chuckled loud part. sub absolutely takes covid historically. twist facts (like death's spiking) otherwise ignore scientific data (even good news) order fear mongering. seen countless people downvoted (including myself) asking question MIGHT go narrative sub. I've downvoted, insulted, criticized saying vast majority people die Covid, undeniable scientific fact. 

Most people sub agenda, spread fear. totally take Covid hysterically. true House Democrats done fuck address outside stern letters sent Pelosi Schumer.  hated term ""do nothing Democrats"" GOP always uses came realization accurate although way Republicans intended.  House Democrats using power deal whatsoever beyond bitching it.  could serving new articles impeachment daily basis.  could sending sergeant arms bring government officials ignore subpoenas.  could number things ultimately right amounts fucking nothing watching country burn around them. Thanks she‚Äôs still alive, hating news ever! Would wonderful lawmakers would consider job limit kind stuff. Doubtful ever happen biggest shithole country earth.  Seems like unbelievably profitable deal. lay people make even more!! rich sure love socialism themselves. sacrifice meaningless

It's not. virus lower baseline thrown caution wind start. mention recommendations screen time. went maybe 1 hour day sitting Zoom hours. leaves time normal screen time school puts kids way limit. workplace opposite, objectively less bad overworked, definitely different type stress.

Our incoming workload least 30-40% expect us keep numbers level full production. like farmer one apple tree, freak growing many apples guy 2 fields worth. I've reduced looking busy keep appearances, that's kind hell HATE hiccups. sounds f'n awful. Sorry deal that! Always buy local! We've got stop funding assholes also unforeseen effect : drive NY residents go states get vaccine.

Cuomo 100% using virus vaccine political reasons point, even screaming not. horrifying me. vaccine eventually allow us stop social distancing mask-wearing?

That's goal, it'll take time that's people realise. minimum amount people vaccinated restrictions lifted. thought Obama put bunch laws place financial sector least 2008 recession Trump (or republican Congress?) undid laws year power. 

Cdn see lot US specific news, always know specifics/follow-ups. We're immune BS opposing parties undoing big things last party put place makes wonder ever progress forward everything gets undone every 4-8 yrs. plenty way 99%. Yellow fever vaccine example. Yes, trump admin actually taken aggressive steps prepare virus, would much different situation managing initial outbreaks. Still would needed proactive precautions prevent spreading elsewhere. 

So many US states still robust tracing capes... unfathomable incompetent response been. simply copied Korea Taiwan February would far normal.

Nothing simple given politicization nonsense muh freedom here. Zero chance americans would let data captured / used govt without fight. Let alone lack public healthcare system willingness collective compliance. Ahh yes. 2003. dark ages science. Physics changed lot since microscopic virus stopped cloth masks like chain link fences stop mosquitos. Ontario. school cases reported public. Yes... understanding dismissed seafood source thought likely quarantine breach maybe they'll revisit thinking this. also seem think Teachers people. actually bad normal ""apolitical"" people. bad effect society whole. 

It sniff sympathetic active members society, drives whole population apathy passivity. end, many people care politics values long personally affect them. 

On hand, terrible display so-called beacon liberty help either. private media US seems capable brainwashing masses state media China could ever dream. would like know company *a wig maker* stock market? annoying part obviously worse numbers see commonly touted, apparently people manipulated thinking virus nearly bad is... people's perceptions virus bad overblown really greatly played official numbers/reporting. can't HONEST SHUT RIGHT MONTH GOD DAMNIT 5 days ago came alot once.

Being broke circumstance happen even despite one's best efforts. becoming clear large majority people get virus symptoms. Early on, found people sick. areas testing, longer true, find many cases. overall fatality rate remains same, ""case"" fatality rate drops significantly. fatality rate also drops hospitals learn treat it.

This think happening Europe. Even though cases spiking, hospitalizations fatalities growing anywhere near rate.

If trend continues, virus eventually become ""just another virus"" part viruses population deal ongoing basis. that, got 0,16 cases per 100k. opened up, started climb again. 28,6 cases per 100k...

You comparing going Target shaking 200 people's hands Trick Treating means arguing good faith concept Trick Treating entails America. two radically different things.

That happens country closes, something social distancing meant prevent. I'm going point obvious contradiction feel like can't enjoy lives.

It's pandemic. people really expect able everything per simply saying people want anymore.

Then cases spike restrictions get tighter. inability others put mild inconvenience led increased restrictions everyone. selfish?

As usual, complicated. 

All countries experience spikes, big small. enough population immune (via infection vaccination). least spikes much accurate. response beginning important... results clear. point even make sense. Sweden close borders world. We're honestly wasting time someone averse one desk. Whats low? cover you. Plenty household members catch covid spread household members.

I'm curious, send kids school? There's always going risk, corona, flu diseases kill many kids every year. Postponement could acceptable outcome mass vaccination right around corner. However, ~ year mass vaccination. That's thin gruel basing sort conclusion on. Winter coming valid fear also quite unrealistic seeing humanity survived many pandemics without masks around forever. guess word 'd00mer' banned sub?

Not dramatically better?!? rich literally worry nothing. can't said almost half US.

Almost half population lives paycheck paycheck. That's poor money skills, that's society intentionally structured.

Minimum wage living wage. city, louisville ky, fast food jobs offer starting pay around 10 dollars. living wage one person 12 dollars. basic jobs, society depends on, allow people survive. account things one control over, like medical emergencies, car repairs, etc.

Medical debt bankrupted countless people, many people die US can't afford medicine need. Yet medical insurance companies still making hand fist, still donating PACS Super PACS continues.

Having access somethings mean people afford it. large segment society upwards mobility, design, (which American Dream, lack thereof) living pay check paycheck, living happily, surviving. Ahhhh yes, famous neighborhood bully goes around forcing people open lemonade stands hit yourself. guess forgot him. /s

Life much easier simply divide people two distinct groups--one ""assholes"" one ""friends"". Username checks out. thinking risk wrong.

You're right many governments one hand working other, right nuts employers require appear person could work remotely. additional risk e.g. working person should:
1. mitigated best (increase ventilation workspace, wear N95, etc.), and
2. compounded additional risks ""living life"" like normal: socializing, making unnecessary trips indoor spaces, etc.

This fatalistic attitude ""oh I'm going get infected anyway might well risky stuff want do"" gets people killed. Yes did. Sweden closed borders non-EU residents disallows people entering EU incredibly ignorant. entire section cemetery near house kids died 1918 pandemic, terms affects kids flu much dangerous. leaked Chinese lab Biden Bill Gates could put chip vapes summoned aliens Atlantis

amidoinitright? Depends. preach caution flaunt anti-mask rhetoric? care letter, he's done.

If never wore mask, can't say sympathy. Sure. people don‚Äôt option, lucky must redistribute means Jesus found United States united all. Every state rules see utterly incompetent leaders many different levels. leader top complete fucking shithead, things would different. better. say recommended dosage 1000 4000 local unemployment rate different national unemployment rate. hard understand. imagine eating full restaurant right now.

Well, junk food shelf stable really long time, stockpile slowly inevitable next lockdown. countries dropped Q4 Q1 Q1 Q2 split total drop two quarters. Sweden grew Q4 Q1 marginally dropped Q2. honest comparison would look drop quarters combined. I've said before, say again, even attracts bootlickers every time:

We *never* give companies free money bailouts. make issue extra stocks, government buys standard market value. dilute stocks massively existing owners, essentially making partially pay bailout directly, brutally punish stock buybacks. also give government voting rights, force company make social choices. strawman Sweden would unique due supposedly country healthcare.

I think might perfect quote end on. I'd reckon probably both. think tons young people infected back too. Good. Time move this. state, masks required public indoor spaces, also outdoors social distancing possible. Additionally, size limit gatherings 50 200, indoors outdoors respectively. It‚Äôs called life Yeah, workers affected that. I've never argued otherwise. would certainly hope country introduced stimulus packages help affected workers pandemic.

That said, worsening outbreak people want party pack bars/clubs comes tighter measures. help all? Australian.. damn I'm glad summer nearly here

Just hope everything burn Here's question I've wondering since DeSantis started this: FL survive without tourists' dollars Bluu counties?

In words, given Florida survive tourism. also given states generate money, typically r3d counties take money. So, people bluu areas (generally) travel FL, Florida's tourist industry survive income taker counties?

Lmfao, thought one. would honestly peak 2020 say that. Front line good never plan lift strict restrictions. Strict restrictions work well hammer infection manageable levels give time prepare second wave.

Absolutely, delicate balance. ""full lockdown"" countries followed ""full reopen"". Perhaps slightly less restrictive lockdown followed slightly less open opening could better. see now, lockdown, even immuniyt, reopening safely difficult.  Sure, nobody wants complex rules paperwork. actually Sweden asked regional travel rules instead national rules first place. 

I think mistake anywhere I'd say, Nordics. Like Nordic countries did. 

Yes! list list lessons \*uniquely\* learned Sweden. sure needed point things done elsewhere (That goes items I'm sure). model suggests start increasing winter comes along. 

We shall see. 

I remember people commenting 200k deaths November crazy talk model overestimating X reasons.

We're month early 200k. Oh hell no. mention single Nordic country? ü§£ü§£ü§£

Oh, *fun*. -200 IQ play Kim Sneppen, professor biocomplexity Niels Bohr Institute Copenhagen, scientist ? ü§£ü§£ü§£ skepticism towards nutraceuticals?

Could interesting developing undeveloped countries. Well explained also believe spreading thanksgiving 2019. personal experience many people said weirdest cold ever around time. didn‚Äôt mental issues people catch today mind make things way worse. caught today would probably die stress thinking going die, accidentally spread kill someone else, kids.

Mid December so, daughter went Seattle antique shops, second hand stores like, looking books her. week got sicker ever been. stuck bed 4 days, fever around 103 wouldn‚Äôt go away meds. laid bed heart pounding chest. daughter it, wasn‚Äôt bad me. son developed cough, fever lasted almost month. husband didn‚Äôt get sick.

I felt really bad 3 weeks, went away I‚Äôve issues exhaustion ever since. People keep saying proof would know? weren‚Äôt looking suspected spreading early January places. give poor beggar vaccine! getting busted? stealing. run lemonade stand. $100 cashbox effective monopolies, corporate consolidation/mergers/parent companies, fraud, tax loopholes, ineffective enforcement regulations regarding business, lobbying create regulations follow, exploitation workers mean make money smaller lemonade stand block ever hope make. 

A loan program created help lemonade stand block. qualify regulatory legislative capture. Since stronger relationship services organizations handing loan (gov. &amp; banks) get first lemonade block street gets caught bureaucratic tape. 

While lemonade stand street waits loan, mom (their supplier) demands money threatens close down. close down.  

Thanks money loan, lemonade stand pays investors, also buys back stock. fire employees, fewer pay, since lemonade selling well. 
Your stock increases value buyback, profits taxes. pay less despite fact loan, rising stock price, less competition, larger desperate prospective workforce, making money ever. 

The fired employees lemonade stand street starve, evicted homes, lose health insurance, hang themselves. 

&amp;nbsp;

This 100% legal, legal people right upset demand change. Law informs morality, way around. you, owner large lemonade stand, decide law. That's good. workload stressful now, concerns job? *please* stop simp Covid? That‚Äôs good news maddening that, despite continuous proof *economies recover*, would argue death, *which outside fiction unrecoverable chronic condition.* I‚Äôm fairly certain step daughters father used funds catch child support. Claimed money pay May-August sudden he‚Äôs buying new house, car sent us $8,000 catch up. owns small dental practice. I‚Äôm pretty sure received small business money used himself. brunt article well intentioned, specific projection IHME likely overblown. I‚Äôd surprised half per day 2021.

Unfortunately, know. actual link suggest much lower like 95% mask usage hope right.

But back April-ish, remember people saying 200k deaths November crazy model probably over-estimating.

We're month early 200k :|

We wait see. Wear masks. Keep distance. Outside activities much possible. Sanitize. cases deaths, seroprevalance assays which, stitched together, give us picture many cases we're missing, thus, true lethality virus. 

I'd argue CFR variable, since directly related amount tests conducting. Solid contribution. Dead people don‚Äôt count old geezers state. Instinctive responses Trump's MO. devotees skeptical scientific research mainstream institutions. Since that's (pun intended) sounding alarm ahead outbreak States, Trump instinctively gave tribe crave.

The opposition certainly politicized Trump's slow, irresponsible (can't argue since man literally said responsible) management crisis. thing saying opposition politicized pandemic virus itself. means employers fire people come back work, people can't go back work they're immune compromised also kicked Unemployment.

Meanwhile, Florida welcoming anti-maskers dining entertainment unavailable elsewhere country! spent long time blaming gay people's behaviour suffering virus. Sweden way better per capita Italy Spain USA Belgium Mexico New Jersey .... Publicly traded companies bound law payout dividends.

So *is* end point? 

Because first ""2 weeks flatten curve"", flattened curve hospitals overrun, goalposts moved infection rate, suggesting ""a month so"" reach...what metric exactly? low infection rate? open phases, cases rise again, just....rinse repeat people's livlihoods destroyed?

You see people get skeptical talk like - really seem like neverending spiral shifting goals rhetoric *looks* lot like desire forever restrictions, even may mean that. say law obviously stupid since travelling social distancing exacerbates situation. Pretty simple. comparing apples oranges. know many people died result narcolepsy, unless do, dishonest compare number deaths covid number people resulted narcolepsy. Furthermore, know longer term health consequences covid, see assume anything IFR. 

Nonetheless, point history show us happened last time rushed vaccine approved administered widely. perfectly reasonable people skeptical rushed vaccine might safe.  let pro-vaccine crowd bully people taking rushed vaccine. That‚Äôs logical fallacy tradition, say we‚Äôve always done way fine. never something incubation period Covid combined travel capabilities today. that, i‚Äôm afraid us getting wiped us danger individually. 200,000 isn‚Äôt 7 Billion, doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs lot.

Yes, U.S. religions presently less pro-choice culture politics gone way. real point, however, independent Catholics comes Church directives upon high point 75% pro-choice one time. Exactly!!!!!! One nanny, one dumb relative... many vectors boom, it.

Can't take chance. It‚Äôs pissing amount people stupid understand we‚Äôre gonna change. give speech Americans come adapt. Bullshit. see selfishness everywhere.

Harsh year kiddos, end world learning deal disappointment also good child's mental health. What‚Äôs interesting people Sask aren‚Äôt wearing masks (aside schools) carrying fairly normally. spouse travels there, wear mask stores get funny looks 70-80% don‚Äôt. Everyone know dining inside restaurants acting fairly normally. sure numbers remained low. Yeah well compound problem fact removing restrictions around indoor dining bars see recipe disaster entitled opinion Thats CFR (confirmed fatality rate.) IFR (infection fatality rate) much lower. .6-1% remember sunbathing forbidden UK. see particularly relevant public health focus squarely overall transmission, afaik kids contribute to.  used years, confirming I'm right then?

It definitive success **fewer people died**. metric success humanity has. economy rebound because, would like repeat it, **fewer people died.** Found facebook user. That's place similarly bad death rates. 20-30% pretty common. So... poor people ü§£ü§£ü§£ Sweden never closed borders never isolated never locked never shut schools never wore masks mandatory think country might overblown Belgium, counting every suspected case. lump cases NJ number went investigation, ~10%. time took deaths enough confirmed deaths happened never even lowered total. open, legal, I'm breaking rules. Stay bunker afraid. think NYC 1/3 people covid-19 also tested covid-19? seems unrealistic me.  Honestly small businesses suck that. Bad leadership clear small worry huge lawsuit.

Since work remotely, everything help around house gets home shower, disinfect things, relax. difficult, think slowly adapting things. still pains deal this. actually decent job explaining article probably didn‚Äôt understand - many companies pay dividends legally obligated so. received financing ‚ÄúWall Street‚Äù anyone, covenant financial contract often require pay dividends ‚Äúloaned‚Äù money. 

I doubt even 10% people sub understand finance even works, nobody scoffs businesses using PPP loans pay interest loans, make mortgage payment, ect. think view ‚Äúcost business‚Äù common folk understand is. 

The author tries explain dividends may required it‚Äôs ‚Äúdifferent‚Äù situation they‚Äôre protesting that‚Äôs case. think goes head many people here. get loan bank, may charge 10% interest. chose investors provide capital exchange equity (shares business ie believe buy half business) contract might state pay x% net income dividends plus xxx,xxxK per quarter next 5 years ‚Äúshareholder‚Äù may group private small investors, hedge fund, even another small business knowledge business extra cash hand. know landscaping business owners real estate, put say 50k get dividend X years plus small slice pie works out. way business decide pay dividend declare bankruptcy. why, author explained, PPP loan used wages current cash hand used dividends. That‚Äôs case business indirectly using PPP loan dividends, that‚Äôs business using less cash mandatory dividends, kicking bankruptcy road another couple quarters hopes recover hand.


The dirty way taking PPP loan paying dividends company exceptionally well, obligation pay dividends shareholders decided take money pay dividends it. stated, 2 mil audited. Dividends must disclosed financial statements. would hilariously stupid anyone accounting department half brain would never try this. reason happened past Congress/bush/Obama admins never put restrictions them, time around political parties plus exec branch unanimously agreed outset would stock buybacks voluntary dividends paid funds. 


I‚Äôll also get stock buybacks situation that‚Äôs vastly complicated break digestible way people would accept without pitchfork herd coming me. I‚Äôll try anyway someone knowledge put ELI5 there. short simple allow small company make fuck load money nearly risk they‚Äôre certain financially rebound rapidly crisis. ex Super clean Corp. stock price tanking I‚Äôm cleaning supplies business, I‚Äôm going actually benefit crisis long term share price go way road. Since customers go business short term business month, I‚Äôve laid employees off, qualify PPP. I‚Äôm going use pay payroll buy stock back, enough PPP money affect stock price drive long term (the PPP loans weren‚Äôt large enough given scale recession) invest couple million make 300% return inside year works expect to. Fast forward 3 months businesses using PPP stay business demand cleaning supplies up, need hire employees money I‚Äôve made shit ton money stock buybacks. 

This story Ecolab, company invested cut executive pay, froze bonuses, laid workers business exploded couple months later. knowledge whether PPP loans taken company so, allocated to. It‚Äôs convenient business case convey point. 

These stock buybacks could also used fraud larger durable companies again, audits, paper trail stock purchases financial situations, great whole time transferring companies income business form executive bonuses ect, it‚Äôs paper. Time tell type fraud/wealth transfer occurred funds future given protections placed money lawmakers time, certainly less past.

If want look misallocation tax dollars look pork barrel funds placed Covid relief bills nothing struggling businesses citizens. I‚Äôll take position party demanded billions traditional causes try throw billions year year never ends helping struggling families. HUNKA CHUNKA!!!! Think general deniers don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs conspiracy hoax, rather general exaggeration hysteria. think it‚Äôs blown way proportion fear mongering headlines used political tool Democrats. problem is, like great conspiracies...there kernel truths here...the Democrats using political weapon media reporting disastrous.

Pro life ass. go suck orange tiddies monster. Well, let‚Äôs see - here‚Äôs 76 war heroes died road 2 weeks. That‚Äôs 50x normal death rate. made Battle Bulge fought Korea winter. survived

I'm curious, seems people saying almost always underlying motivations - believe masks affront freedom, want travel, view social distancing business restrictions inconveniences, retirement funds hinge stock market want collapse, etc.

But can't see underlying motivation side, like advantage creating fake pandemic? always see many people saying scientists politicians lying, see payoff would be. WANTS wear masks, one WANTS sit home nothing, etc. Tegnell quote.

I'm asking favour. I'm claiming posting misinformation.

The fact refusing post source seems support fact. reduce R number say 2 0.1 would cause die-out. Unfortunately, CDC's credibility grossly compromised partisan interference regarding health crisis. can't know whether true, mouths moved White House hand stuck back shirts. I'd like believe true, that's quite enough. random, out-of-nowhere thing lately. Never problem before. Started 2018. Job-hunting pandemic clear intend step foot office treatment vaccine. worked remote last 8 years zero intention exposing family COVID. wife disabled, daughter 5 remote learning.

I've holding quite well. potential eviction looming front me, crying happens often, randomly. many deaths years?  part every vaccine research group? criteria false hope?

""mUh FrEeDoM TaKen AwAY"" alot people wish job go to... really don‚Äôt care takes decade hold people accountable. need held accountable. It‚Äôs depressing overworked company doesn‚Äôt care you, customers don‚Äôt care enough wear mask/stay far enough away. basically retailers man, #FuckPublix [it greeat news. except BBC better article app download required. Sure, even around people various levels precautions take. outside possible, wear masks, keep distance.

Seems pretty clear republican governors generally less likely take basic precautions democratic ones. Fishy stuff, agree Lol, generation. Babies.

I'd argue voting local offices far important big cheese too. Change starts bottom, foundation. ""The bottom totem pole"" insult; totem crumble without stability base. gotta start somewhere, eh? would ask HR planning managing 50% work force sick. 

That really sucks, I'm sorry. Im talking coronavirus. know many people ended hospital that. 


I‚Äôm talking FLU!


The flu ends lives small percentage people, despite terrible disease catch it, survive.

And MUST survive live world machismo attitude ‚Äúmen don‚Äôt get sick, men don‚Äôt get hurt, men don‚Äôt complain‚Äù.  edit makes seem like we‚Äôre skeptical basic fucking science. guess manipulative petty reasons part personality though since reply ultra defensive.

It's interesting stuff like ""viral load"" entering lexicon lately.

One side want get excited fact UK seeing significantly lower mortality rate thus far, second spike (I've learned expect good news get debunked *moment* start believing it), idea masks, preventing spread, meaning people exposed safer doses virus, interesting. one 3 things actually going sizable effect stopping virus. Lazy hobbits need lay pipe weed. Yes sarcasm page article doesnt work "" new mutated covid"". ""But give Executives bonuses, leave going want take place sinking ship?"" -someone buys gop party line way hard Even achieve Q3 numbers, NZ would still definitive success since mean sacrifice anything achieve low COVID numbers. üòê outburst makes sense though, right? could anyone get frustrated arrogance willful refusal listen?  like child eating poison pediatrician comes says, no, eat poison. respond with, no, pediatrician trustable (not even real word btw) person? seriously, trustworthy person Dr. Fauci, eyes?

We're one 50 states, 1/9th country lives lol. Child repeating again, even pointed out. source Denmark's total deaths overtaking Sweden's?

That‚Äôs happens u try protect life slow head something? misleading facts ? Trump's fault! cases never registered way, shape, form. logistics testing many people, many no/mild/moderate symptoms. California largest state largest population. remain true.
Also true per capita, United States America infections

Seriously, I'm curious reasoning someone dying matter. It‚Äôs time start jailing corporate ‚Äúleaders.‚Äù Enough enough enough. 

Iceland set phenomenal example jailing bankers following sub-prime fiasco. One thing that‚Äôs fun think case roux get us formation 2018 VP1 that‚Äôs supposed hit earth November. 2018 VP1 expected hit day elections happening US. world leaders science organizations seem paying attention fact year alone earth seen dramatic increase ‚ÄúClose Calls‚Äù. seems though we‚Äôre asteroid dust storm many reported. They‚Äôre getting closer. purportedly bigger. World leaders encouraged masks get us ready wearing masks 2018 VP1 strikes, whoever survived need mask air harder breathe debris every where. would imagine kids dying, killing parents, grandparents, close family members, would much worse harsher effect kids missing one year school (which relatively easily made for, assuming they're still alive/have family alive support make lost year). someone food stamps buys steak it‚Äôs end world. Right?? want people like us! would good artist now, too, free time energy practice getting hamster wheel day. think LIKE nearly much social interaction? like gas tank. fill hospitals empty. Go. Flying actually safer enclosed spaces, able social distance. air gets replenished often, much often normal room. flew month ago flight sadly quite full, end summer. much less busy moment. would perfect Explain Like I'm 5. Love it! people fucking stupid. 200,000 dead. think anyone really graps number. Take look 100 people bunched up, try imagine times 2000. amount people killed Covid could fill fucking *fields*. Covid cemetary, it'd almost big Fort Snelling Cemetary. seen it, look it. despise people stupidity. I'm even adult, realize this. big hotel chains cheated loans claiming individual hotels business? fact oversight committee loans fired Trump first thing replaced, almost oversight loan process?

You can't place blame pork barrel spending, I'd surprised earmarks even approached money given large corporations need all. Well, least dont keep questioning intelligence. shown plenty.

That's right, can. also much likely get go hang pub. perception risk whack. totally risk-free mean heap risk ""eh I'm already risk"". think ignorant small state gets representation California senate feeling never hear ever again- like potential treatments. Classic Reddit, needing source basic intuitive thinking (and ignoring source fit narrative, see: CDC COMPROMISED!!!!!). simple fact used ""reliable"" already shows immediately ignore source agree preestablished CDC stats 2017.

 Here's NYT article doctors NYC, worst hit area entire world, almost people coming heart attacks strokes, illnesses often cause obesity old age, two primary morbidities COVID-19. unquestionably see lower amount people dying illness year end year morbidity statistics. Why? died COVID instead. use basic google search find plenty stories hospitals empty outside COVID patients. look comorbidity statistics COVID deaths see many conditions already morbidly obese. 202,000 excess deaths. called ""harvesting effect"" bad virus (typically flu) kills vulnerable population earlier might died illnesses. saw reverse Italy year flu weak large fragile population elderly/ill people December/January likely would died due influenza gotten it.

This disease reckoning real pandemic happily swept rug another decade more, obesity poor nutrition. neoliberals conservatives wonder communism socialism gaining traction again. ugly scandal, hope people face serious consequences.

Just, pls specific: mean ""the market""? Finland went 'panic mode' 'shut entire country' duration New Zealand. They're better Sweden.

It's almost though expected, countries relying tourism hit harder pandemic. That's unemployment due covid, also thank fan get... Okay, loss social interaction academics set kids back certain amount. hand, think psychological set back trauma child's teacher die janitor die support staff die class mate. going carried rest life.

Academics catch up. equation social development versus potential psychological trauma. know even question. Either make schools safe wait safe. It‚Äôs true flu, either. strength power, quality character determines medical outcome. think spread it, crazy. revive economy later. Can't grandma. re-election fall? dumb won‚Äôt die, they‚Äôll spread it, take home give kids older relatives. People keep talking Covid19 regards living dying. It‚Äôs FAR insidious that. flu. live die. love fully recover shortly sick resume normal life.

With Covid seems HUGE proportion people don‚Äôt die aren‚Äôt recovering fully 1,2,3,4 months overcoming virus. seems long term drastic life altering affects people‚Äôs health. That‚Äôs WAY concerning personally, since chance dying minimal age 55. 

But complications, relapses inability resume normal life myriad lingering symptoms. That‚Äôs life changing. pro athletes Covid19 imagine need retire simply aren‚Äôt health-wise president infection. 

Imagine whole world huge amount population complications hinder lives, possibly rest lives, possibly shortening lives. 

Here US seems might lose rights medical service pre existing conditions, devastating people Covid months years later continue deal repercussions symptoms disease. 

A 50% effective vaccine sort like saying WW1 soldier gas mask blocks 50% chlorine gas kill you, really ideal. essential workers, especially healthcare workers No, Yep, we're eventually going admit get back 'normal' going new normal, old one we've left behind. 
And seriously, right mind (not counting obscenely rich want change insane racists happy institutionalized racism) would actually want go back completely old normal? mentioned needed mask make beard itch less responded 'don't worry it. This'll election'


Right. virus cares whether there's election hand not... guess also include fact avid anti maskers claims 'medical reasons' wear mask.. rest job great. anti maskers. Spotsylvania? fuck back 4chan already. IFR .00007 (.007%), based current deaths

2.8 billion people infected US 
1.3 billion people infected India 
1.9 billion people infected Brazil 
430+ million people infected Peru. 

Seem legit. mean government put hand controls supposed free market systematically squeezed small business owner benefit ""friends"" mega companies position power profit millions lose shitty jobs homes exist persistent squeezing control government generations effectively creating socialist economy wears capitalist mask common people mad wrong thing never even realize actually wrong world eventually accept socialism lay grave made us dig ourselves? ...I'm saying masks *effective*, *ineffective*. keep COVID.

You're mixing guy, appears sociopathic eugenicist. said that's vibin, stand behind 100%. And? Well that‚Äôs awful. Yup, first colleges august, first towns/cities months earlier finally, 7 months started federal government thinking Total lockdowns impossible US. People demoralized second see mass protesting outside allowable causes. -12.2% two quarters row would steep depression would almost assuredly come loss QOL loss life. think anyone definitively say countries come better point. know effects everything years probably decades need start rationing. reasoning success determined choices opportunities leads believe privilege numerous opportunities isn‚Äôt one recognize you‚Äôve blessed have. &lt;3 thank dont give 2 shits reddit subreddits, lol, doesnt seem fairly obvious? develop vaccine poor loves much That's stupid, send us notes lice scabies. tell us school covid-19 cases.  like ""home entitled fucking idiots"". case significant numbers, I‚Äôd expect visible know, reported on. Google homeschool requirements. 

In Texas pretty much sending letter school saying ""we're peacing out, bye!"" Nah. Let rich pay big bucks cheaper rest run lemonade stand. $10 cashbox people buying lemonade like used to. best friend employee. Unfortunately, owe $10. mom last week gave $5 buy lemons sugar also supplies water ice card table, glasses, helps setup cleanup yourself. Mom kinda tired helping you, says can't pay back tomorrow, closing down. 

Your neighbor comes says, here, I'll give loan $5 keep going, pay friend pay Mom, thinks Mom fine go without. So, take loan, $15, pay friend Mom know mom shut whole operation pay back deal Mom every day. hope business pick able pay friend future, knows that's really going happen?

So, ""break law"" though paying Mom? didn't, friend get $10 would immediately job. [archive link anyone trouble accessing article zero lift it. nice try jab. huge shock. Companies struggling March got money. struggling now, others struggling future. business owner, would make sense apply March today, even though need March. There's bailout table now, want it, get early. knew it'd happen shitshow finally come.

So money, meantime? invest. takes always horrible around subreddit, I‚Äôve found several posts guess way better New Zealand ;) government give money businesses. people still tools still exist. knowledge again. let fail someone else take place. 

The risk business owner funded government. tax money going to, better pockets rich business owner plan ahead already tools support themselves. Stimulus go people bills pay they, pay taxes, decide spend money. 

The economy restructure itself, people decide next move instead clinging failed businesses. Charging keep shitty payless store stocked pandemic. That's like socialism maintain shittier standards rich get stay control business keeping every gap closed others want start can't compete. Wait make mistake already? union immediately makes place better work. Period. got second round?

I believe still funding bad press clamp plus additional scrutiny.

First round definitely big guys tho. Still better nothing anti masker. Nice, newspaper article lol

About last point, size methanthiol actually 0.4 nanometers, virus causes Covid 60-140 nanometers. What‚Äôs hilarious didn‚Äôt even read source got 111 from: ‚ÄúThe distance methane molecule 111 microns.‚Äù say that. Sweden saw 8.6% drop GDP. I'm sure that's significantly better. Nordic countries saw GDP fall less *despite* going lockdown. sure reality supports argument.

'Sweden's GDP fell 8.6% second quarter year, according statistics body.

The fall sharper neighbors ‚Äî Denmark registered 7.4% fall, Finland 3.2% fall. Statistics suggest Norway also fared better  Wear mask you‚Äôll fine. Gosh, state live in? going bars *pandemic*, right? Also, 5% particles may smaller SARS-COV2 virus. say 5% viruses, *particles*. properly fitted N95 keep anything resembling dangerous viral load.  people see think it‚Äôs ok expose children send school w/o consequences.

And consequences later life contract illness...  North Dacovid positive test rate 27.4%. dont seem intelligent enough read subreddit rules seem understand subject matter subs spamming. Intentional spamming good way get account banned. I'm tempted say let nature take course. smart fine dumb, well, whatever happens, happens. Something tells DeSantis sympathy unemployed. gives business owners cover firing people even feel safe come back work, making people unemployed putting risk becoming ill. economy fucking fine. mega rich parasite class problem. key isn‚Äôt keeping kids schools keeping grandparents.

Which profits exactly? source Denmark's total deaths overtaking Sweden's?

I made now, afraid admit wrong Belgium, Italy, Netherlands, Denmark.

What wrong about? made claims either.

Just give us Tegnell quote. getting silly. Radicalization answer. lead violence destruction. going improve anything anyone. stupid fly right now?

We seen state family since 2019. We've already decided skip Thanksgiving Christmas trip Seattle Missouri planned next week. Grandpa went hospice made last minute decision go. N95s eye protection airport plane. whole house AirBNB rental car. We're meeting family outside porches masks. 

On top that, already COVID-19 really early pandemic, anyone knew community transmission. positive antibody test June. wife tested negative antibodies COVID-19 symptoms despite living together sick taking zero precautions symptoms. Again, late February first recorded COVID-19 death, even think could COVID-19.

We're early 30s. high risk. would do? respond nicely you, said want covid numbers sky rocket, like that's something normal human wish.

I insulted enough. Fuck disgusting pos really feel this. I'm hospital lab tech - draw blood patients specimen processing. 
I know fault, really hard swallow seeing newer coworkers barely function position they're in, older previous ""experience"" me, make 3-4 dollars hour more. Meanwhile, I'm taking try get done. previously made feel really proud excel much work. loved going beyond. now, feel used - like shell person. existence boring - go exciting things, pandemic. anything interesting talk anymore. 
I want freak boyfriend necessary I'm worried talking terrible feel time make dam break whole mess come spilling out. Feels like vicious cycle. US it, newsworthy important says something American culture. France it, oh well, big deal I'll get two each


I'm built different Oh yeah Total deaths week went 27%. doesnt mean death rate went 27%. CFRs generally dropping around world. understand pandemic works, you? US.

I referring travel plans.  


Your numbers Italy correct. don‚Äôt know, might something lockdown thinking 40% people would gotten Stockholm May, 15%. think reason western developers going new experimental vaccine technologies traditional methods associated adverse side effects SARS-1 candidates. Thankfully seems like thats case this.  Great üëç Way better Rick Scott. I've impressed him. coming someone voted Gillum. course did., repercussions. People came senses? Many worst predictions failed come true. short term promise flattening curve extended indefinitely exit plan. promise vaccine looks magic bullet end things night. point people risk assessment start resuming normal life. got extra $2 hour month. I‚Äôve double work 6 months now. Get names. Get 'em list. think settled comes back like Europe (where thought they'd got low enough), repeat cycle? entire policy book around nonsensical. Keep distancing masking, sure, extreme steps keep curve flat seems delaying inevitable point cost mental health economic well-being. Needs free space Heavens Waiting Room. recover arguing guys wall street doing,*short term investing* gambling, long term investing (ie: index funds retirement) different practice providing loan. suggest random sample??

You‚Äôre also ignoring every thing posted like taken IFR coronavirus / number deaths get approximation number people it. There's goalpost. Robust vigorous testing onset pandemic always key safely getting back state normalcy. 

Because federal response stumbled first two months gate, we're still suffering consequences ineptitude.

Unfortunately, cannot cut corners definitively except positive results. disagree? Fuck that. kindergarten. I've taught kindergartners. fine there's pandemic i've heard well. 
/cringeworthy though, wakeboard testing better easily available. free stay home, one making go bars restaurants. still wear mask socially distance minimally impact you. wildfires made difficult get tested. Things level another week so. Maybe microscopic fraction military budget? pandemic never end. I'm waiting movie come cause want see spin win... say it. one see it. 

Works great everyone. points GDP instead thousands lives. way spin this, NZ everything right citizens I'd proud country. Heck, I'm still proud regrardless. beacon light seems like abysmal tunnel back Dark Ages rest world. Good thing started finasteride last year... God, hope works. program absolutely ridiculous design. get loan equal 2.5 months payroll, layoff anyone defined period, loan convertible grant.

Even work available, can't layoff employee.

Compare German ""short-time"" model. business work, simply layoff employee. government *pays employer* 60% employee's salary. employer continues pay employee normal means, reduced rate.

When work comes back, business simply rehires already-trained worker.

The worker happy, even though substantially reduced wages, also work throughout period, never gaps unemployment verification. employer continued pay throughout, reduced rate.

The employer happy, permanently layoff employee, already-trained worker comes back, overhead paying employee work done.

No one needs apply special loan, loans need converted, unemployment needs filed. Employers simply report number employees temporarily placed short-time.

The US going tens millions people changing jobs, retraining, causing churn economy, might naturally healthy, certainly en masse result economic disruption.

Germany bunch workers simply report back work work available.

In US, even business planning let anyone go, still got funding. I'm Germany, businesses temporarily placed workers leave get funding.

The German model costs small fraction US model, everyone ends happier. fucking pathetic, stop removing comments hurt feelings start removing misinformation allowing spread brand new accounts. fucking joke.

Finally, there's reason believe young people getting infected March. Again, we're testing more. Young people probably catching exactly rate then. I‚Äôm going give benefit doubt assume comment unclear. 

No, could imagine forced deal rude customers knowingly endanger workers disrespecting ways never tolerated. story 'large scale', addressing specific comments made school board member death teacher community.

**The gist it:**

CoV-OC43 causes common cold, might caused much severe illness made first jump humans. Could coronavirus transition humans, initially causes severe pandemic, eventually abates virus mutates becomes completely endemic population?

I don‚Äôt doubt possible severity symptoms, completely agree it‚Äôs possible, likely, certain cases. don‚Äôt like sub‚Äôs penchant going depressing narrative.

The fact is, cases recover. That‚Äôs debatable.

As point, here‚Äôs found. like large percent people symptoms months, right?

Well, no. It‚Äôs large percent hospitalized (which large percent overall cases), definition fully recovered one lingering symptom.

I‚Äôm downplaying severity, original claim wrong. thought orange republic. Controlled orange guy. far line thinking extend?

What level risk acceptable? activities might require rescue, thus putting rescuers risk apply? activities might cause emotional physical harm? Riding motorcycle much dangerous enclosed vehicle, fault someone could become emotionally scarred forever due it.

I‚Äôm American. Given Florida unemployment system reworked order make claim unemployment state lower was, makes perfect sense. history humanity, single person died eating much liquorice? think that's bad science rely anecdotal evidence like that?

To me, seems like blatant case misinformation spread MSM liquirice consumed hundreds years, countries like Finland eaten much larger quantities USA, one dying it. 

Are surprised man ate bag half liquirice month gets health complications? Perhaps, things moderation. know whether intentionally not, spreading misinformation here. mandates work. Good discussion! think CFR IFR highly variable.

We know IFR exponential based age, simple formula 1% 65-year-old, increasing (decreasing) factor 10 every 20 years older (younger) are. Applying population distribution US gives similar numbers we've seen.

But means IFR vary hugely getting infected. particular, keeping COVID nursing homes could reduce factor 2 alone (from 1.4% value saw spring). top we're also elderly people (outside nursing home) lot careful, IFR could drop exponentially. truly competent society could drafted intentionally infected 25% least vulnerable population back February mostly herd immunity wit almost deaths.

Meanwhile CFR certainly vary too, even IFR. vary ways IFR, also testing gets better worse test find different percentage infections.

Seroprevalence unfortunately seem useful anymore, antibodies lost short time people. sero studies spring NYC, Spain, UK, Sweden. places large outbreaks within short period, sero studies done soon thereafter. sero study done tell total infected, would find unknown percentage people infected based long ago infected.

Meanwhile methodology France simple. 1-2% CFR while, reported deaths lag 1 month behind reported cases. look 7-day rolling average cases deaths, although thrown day 3-day weekends. Assuming CFR remains range (obviously big assumption) 500 cases 5-10 deaths summer (low point 6), rising 3842 daily cases month ago thus 38-76 deaths per day today (actual value: 60) rising 11,680 cases today thus 116-232 deaths per day month now. issues simple model, agrees data well see make better one know.

This far fewer deaths March, since idea IFR compares then, know why. IFR lower, we're testing larger percentage cases? Obviously both, idea degree true. idea wave continues rise, point level off. allowed say rojo azul? important cases competing *against* federal government. pandemic response supplies. insaneballs. 400 million Chinese take? even need PPP loans think company well enough pandemic want buy back stock? There‚Äôs change prevention measures too. Restaurants bars operate full capacity, previously allowed run 50%. CFR. Main factors? I'll disagree. main factors one political parties, one currently power believe virus big deal, believe masks work, believe science - *those* main factors. others good though. doubt old company lining pockets canning people kind viral pneumonia debilitating middle-aged older

And often shut type issues? answer never. seems people actually wear mask required mostly respect rules. Yes odd idiot that's what's causing problems. three Hold applauses consider kind person Prymula is:
- past worked towards establishing ""traditional chinese medicine"" clinic part publicly funded healthcare
- lied conflict interest public function simultaneously private pharma company

I'm sorry Florida comply idea safety. Luckily take whatever precautions want, live life. school culprit that's supposed do! Would worse admit ""oh yeah we've plenty reported cases"" somehow everybody class?

Good Quit trying blame Trump things realize that.

When identifying solve problems, typically sound reasoning identify where/how things went wrong, mistakes repeated.

Did listen Woodward interviews? [Trump talking sides mouth March goal shut two weeks prevent hospitals overwhelmed.

The government also said masks help stop spread COVID-19 meaningful way. wrong, strategies shifted. Welcome people saying masks stay vaccine,

Sounds like smart idea. one that's really much sacrifice. California's governor saying reopen new case numbers drop false-positive rate tests.

Are making point much better leadership California compared Florida? so, agree you. woosh

right head. quickly dropped hammer lifted speed. Whole summer without restrictions all. example facemasks mandatory anymore 9th September. 

Looks like whole summer infection kept steady march radar. slow start exponential growth. flamed up. divide upper middle class office/tech worker everyone else never stark.

What allows arbiter acceptable risks? say follow laws, makes different places lax restrictions right now, people enjoying themselves? One might argue conditioner better... relatively speaking.. Jesus stupid statement do, world cant stay locked forever. Prime Minister Boris Johnson pledge Saturday 30% increase funding World Health Organization urging reforms global health body calling revival cross-border cooperation end ‚Äúugly rifts‚Äù.  recorded speech United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), Johnson say COVID-19 pandemic increased barriers trade.  also present five-point plan improve international response future pandemics.  nine months fighting COVID, notion international community looks tattered,‚Äù say, according advance extracts distributed office.  unite turn fire common foe, know everyone lose. time therefore ... humanity reach across borders repair ugly rifts.‚Äù  plan includes global network research hubs, vaccine manufacturing capacity, agreement reduce export tariffs imposed start COVID-19 pandemic.  commit initial 71 million pounds global vaccine partnership known COVAX secure purchase rights 27 million doses, 500 million separate COVAX initiative help poorer countries access vaccine.  also announce 340 million pounds ($433.23 million) funding spread across four years - 30% increase previous four-year commitment - around third money dependent reform organisation.  along France Germany, expressing support WHO, albeit tied reforms, body faces criticism pandemic response.  United States gave year‚Äôs notice July leaving U.N. agency - created improve health globally - Trump accused close China mishandled COVID-19 pandemic. know; miss old normal, wish pandemic never happened. However, United States screwed over, we're paying price.

Too bad lot people seem hard time accepting this; sideline subs, mainstream subs like one well! spite consistent recent messaging trusted health experts too, less. feel like trying harder make known many people find (both online real life), I'm afraid growing body resistance, clambering return pre-pandemic normal soon possible defiance current public health guidelines expectations. Right. issue see tolerance level cases too. mean state 1000 cases per day, that's seen acceptable reason. slowly trending upwards, stuff opening. Amazing low tolerance something inconvenient (like wearing mask) sake saving people's lives long term health.

Which true. need least attempt mutate multiple strains like seasonal flu. seasonal, we'd basically always dealing terrible pandemic try gain herd immunity via vaccination. may also find therapies deal interim. mass effort modern technology, potentially achievable within year two.

what I'm advocating first restricting spread tampering it, reopening semi-permanent restrictions clear hit point least deal infection people get it. therapeutics deal currently bad cases. 

the economic argument tired bullshit. everyone knows point letting virus spread shut economy worse, somehow learn trial many countries saw coming. fact someone even argues point kind infuriating totally tied together - proper response = reopening / better economy. Ignoring things/acting like pandemic exists = people infected, shut fully again, bad economy plus countless death costs come many people getting sick. might mess trial though, it‚Äôs suppose last well longer vaccines probably gonna approved, would good check long term affects like ADE Sorry, that's dash separate title lead header. realize people would interpret negative number I'll careful next time. massive waste time resources especially first one get works fine you. fat healthy. fact countries high death figures fat. know what? That‚Äôs don‚Äôt like hear, think overweight health condition is. overweight 60 higher chance dying. affects Hispanics blacks more? higher chance overweight don‚Äôt like I‚Äôm saying, read reports drink beer. virus don‚Äôt care feelings is.  mini discussion recently, people overall dont seem grasp simply isnt way back old world. believe it. refuse learn anything. Lot‚Äôs y‚Äôall Qaeda here. Yeah sure, decisions solely based definition single word.

(/s) Oh ya true means fully pretend covid exist corporations making money. read even UV 222nm, take 30 seconds kill virus, means exactly zapping virus air. directional, sterilize things path beam. reduce amount viral particles, sure, get rid completely. Expecting everyone cater selfish. it, stop pretending demanding everyone live according level comfort isnt selfish. solely, yes, that's one many factors thought potentially contribute seasonality. (time indoors, HVAC use, school calendars, temp, humidity, UV/radiation levels, precipitation, etc).

Thus far, COVID seems track closely seasonality influenza, regardless ""why,"" numbers show numbers show.

New fallout seems bit hard good news? POV perspective really cold blooded murderer.  Actually, IHME originally projecting around 30k deaths total Covid-19 end summer. They‚Äôve mark every stage game.

We won‚Äôt anywhere close 95% mask usage (unfortunately), still won‚Äôt anywhere near 400k dead January. don‚Äôt see could get us short curves every major population hub United States (most steady and/or falling) suddenly violently reversing. got little UV lamp S10 screen protector...any good?üëçüòÅ . ¬£30 fro.

* Florida cases per 1M: 32,400
* Florida deaths per 10M:6,478

* Texas cases per 1M: 25,560
* Texas deaths per 10M: 5,265

* California cases per 1M: 20,252
* California deaths per 10M: 3,902

Add fact California initially well head Florida Texas, also makes earnest effort test widely ensures counties falsifying numbers.

Literally could clear. never offended something 100% agree  Best could find indicates 9.5% GDP drop USA 12.2% New puts NZ substantially better position, imagine, since there's virtually loss life health... reputation. since economy tourism-oriented one may infer rest economy comparatively stable.

Well train sailed. need vaccine. would recommend non-alcoholic alternatives. Therapy (or shrink), tea, meditation, exercise, sleep, etc. much better long term solutions. arguing sideways, going away original point. expect intentionally. 

The original point American society structured benefit rich, expense poor. Everything said underlines this, almost nothing said defeats this.

When medical care affordable, minimum wage living wage, vast amount Americans living paycheck paycheck, maybe American society officially geared towards rich.

Not mention things making corporations rich pay fair share taxes, money politics, etc. Ok? read one previous posts, know Im complaining work. fully acknowledge job hard, work hard. Get high horse know! hope pandemic normalizes mask wearing influenza, sort like SARS East Asia.

Yes, masks required flu season Asia, considering selfish intolerant American culture is, much Americans love ""freedumbs"", ought be.

Every decent professional, Fauci NYT Redfield, agreed even vaccine out, still need require social distancing mask-wearing least one year! think, however, permanent thing.

Keep up, guys. We're getting closer end day, we're yet. never learn it? flu ravaging world decades. waiting treatments may never come, vaccine 50% effective 6 months? people want cause panic keep public safe. surprise, know affect things like vitamin is. like relearning science saying several decades. might new virus, immune systems same, lack vitamins minerals said systems. Meanwhile, Florida:

[Everyone opens phase one thing common f‚Äôn morons get fake news Federal Government‚Äôs guy propaganda network. Every state 30-60% population thinks Covid hoax vehemently refuse help containment efforts lose loved one. 

It requires either cooperation herd immunity 70% population. states effectively keep pandemic others need half anti-makers get infected things improve. working elderly sick. elderly sick virus safe them. IFR means total estimated amount cases. There's huge amount cases never get caught either asymptomatic mild person bother get tested. brings overall fatality rate down.  Absolute horseshit.

Who's expecting happen indefinitely? whole point keep people businesses afloat 2-3 month lockdown help would never want living like that.

Then probably find different planet. one country done so. answer question, makes far sense send money individual people. people choose businesses support. Kinda like capitalism. government pick winners, exacerbate inequities? Still bad, honestly... sadly, see leading even prejudice unprotected, hard working people. There's fruit, vegetables, canned items, pasta, rice, many different kinds bread, hot dogs, hamburgers, poultry... think would perfectly fine without deli look Trump views military spoken them.  ""losers"" ""suckers"". zero respect GOP zero respect them.  Remember GOP wanted revoke healthcare 9/11 first responders took Jon Stewart testifying congress along Democratic support make sure happen.  whole sides nothing Russian propaganda easily proven false little effort.

Trump allowed entire Navy ship get infected covid19 involved firing ship's Captain simply said Captain followed military chain command trying something help men.

So stupid them.  That's nice you. postponed Sao Paulo, Rio, Recife know. Sao Paulo they're talking May. Masks work layer defense. 

Over thousand health care workers died COVID (worldwide). overwhelmingly worked COVID wards early adequate PPE. sheer amount COVID particles came contact 10 12 hours day, weeks months, eventually wore system. us situation, need focus layer defense protect ourselves, household interact with. one wants pick COVID friend's house take home grandma. So, need concerned with? Let's walk it.

Layers defense: Masks, Proximity People Clean Air Circulation. Wearing mask guarantee breathe particles. mask lower amount particles breathe in. live household someone COVID, breathe air day long, high chance getting COVID. mean symptoms? Depends. could asymptomatic feel fine, however, pass others. advice limit interaction outside household. Essentially, create bubble (some countries call pod) limit exposure.

Compare three scenarios.

In first, group friends (who live together) get together house hours without masks. breathe other's air. right next someone inside room home breathe air. Thinking way smelling someone's perfume feet away, cigarette smell drifting across, etc.  air circulates. one get together COVID, increased chance others got together get it. wearing masks, confined space outside (clean) air flow.

In second scenario, group friends gets together outside park. wear masks sit chairs blankets bring, spread room them. Two meters, three meters, let's say room. air flow since outdoors. one COVID, little chance another friend group get it. masks on, outside airflow.

In third scenario, group friends go restaurant. sit next table wear masks eat drink (obvious). dining inside, scenario group friends got together inside house, breathing people's air. many cities, countries, states, etc limiting many people inside restaurant time (25%, 50%, etc) try minimize potential spread. exact science, clear much person needs inhale order infected, seems differ based age, health unknown reasons well. starting see cases inside dining, good example Starbuck Korea recently.

If dining outside, less chance breathing air another table, happen. Again, question much person need breathe become infected.  outdoor dining scenario, tables two meters away, issue still remains one friends COVID asymptomatic. Now, sitting right next other, across table breathing other's air hour eat, drink talk. 

I hope helps. doctor scientist, take politics economics it, look know, layers defense seems like answer. Stay safe. That's works. autistic teenage boy... Fuck you, woman. Using son's condition prop.

I care status fancy job title. want enough money comfortable, buy occasional art supplies video game, make sure cat food. excess death year 200,000 official death toll actually counting. Youd think god would protect pope covid. even need vaccine? time US jobs program started helping white collar workers sources that?

Silk fiberous protein created insects, mined material.. great news. 200000 Americans already died, survival rate 99.98 percent, math says 1 billion Americans infected virus. think herd immunity - right? one see tears walk in. hell think happens participate refuse hand hard earned money? Government uses force extort money. 

That said, governments free money hand like candy bars. money paid people debts paid people. cant expect people stay home government pay expenses conjuring money.

I would never want living like that. mention government money would probably earn now.

The crime following covenants ppp loans immediate payment back government plus interest memory serves correctly.

I cannot imagine many companies risked this, least, counsel accountant.

Then again, company think going bankrupt, suppose would something someone less ethical would do. said masks work. know story needed limit many masks used, really blame folks feeling like they've got shaken faith health officials, lied us once, believe now?

Don't. CDC proven untrustworthy times since March. Look sources. 

My husband bought masks back end March believed many foreign sources saying could help CDC. Chinese government may shady, know viruses, big masks, decided probably know better government. Korea Japan also recommendations masks early on.

There plethora studies Asia effectiveness different situations. laboratory studies look actual amount droplets spread without masks. There's simply ton information supporting use masks. source? thought found virus didn‚Äôt show viable? Except shit obviously quite hard fix, evidently. shopping ? everybody left positions you‚Äôd shit luck wouldn‚Äôt ? 

Why battle ensure every person right healthy happy life ? take away people entitled basic necessity year 2020 ? aren‚Äôt snowflake pussies   get students literally fault here. cmon way much expected moment. people running country states creating policy throwing caution wind, advocating reopenings, masks orders etc. 18-22 year olds finally told go back school, they‚Äôre given full blame acting like kids age? fully understand attitude might especially age a) risk taking higher feel invincible b) virus doesn‚Äôt affect nearly much c) they‚Äôve watch rest country act like buffoons whole thing. angsty young adult self would probably feel way too. Unfortunately 1.2 billion people plus non-Catholic politicians pander them. PPP loans citizens = brain dead socialism

PPP loans corporations = smart capitalism? 1. heartless, truth. 

2. No, I'm saying ""nobodies"". I'm saying death inevitable far OVERALL deaths year different year causes death. Please don‚Äôt mention NZ. crazy Kiwi guy soon enter discussion. progress pandemic, realize point, over.

And over, become folks suddenly blossomed become self-taught medical viral experts, PPE Zealots, Social Distancing Karens?

What nothing dwell on, people vilpend?

Can go back living normal lives?

When people say, ""Things never same"", beginning agree.. However, think real answer here, people. obviously troll really sick person. 

Seek help. COVID-19: I'm bad guy worked pandemic, longer harder times honest (she social work biomedical industry) we're completely burnt out. depression real, go away. beautiful vacation planned August cancel last minute surge cases destination. We're hoping might able January I'm skeptical.

We're lucky working, remind myself, important, 6 months we've done little work 10-12 hour days, come home exhausted, sleep, again.

I never forgive fucking idiots ever take pandemic seriously. They've stolen time, they've killed people, I've pedal metal job 6 straight months can't bothered empathy. batch testing helpful low incidence area. high incidence batches positive end testing people individually nonetheless trying minimize pandemic

Only bank could issue PPP loan SBA. applied bank, bank applied SBA. SBA rejected it, PPP loan bank. SBA accepted it, PPP apply forgiveness later. Forgiveness processes started last week so, really much news yet companies getting getting it, issues it. set timelines, apply get money get forgiven immediately, apply forgiveness time window SBA make decision, say becomes loan bank.. mean, 1% interest rate loan, win almost situations long fraud. also get PPP without 2019 payroll documents (or specific tax documents certain solo practice situations).

There programs well known PPP. (Economic Injury Disaster Loan) EIDL time PPP, less funding smaller, amount could get lower upper limit, one feature though could get $10k immediately (Was setup $1000 per employee, get $10k need 10 employees lie) $10k automatically forgiven, even loan get approved. EIDL PPP EIDL money assumed part PPP total. EIDL know much compared PPP, know forgivable. also think self administered SBA apposed PPP handled banks. 

Your friend's coworker's scam work something like this, use someone's good name file kind sole proprietor 1099 contractor, apply EIDL lie number employees get 10k automatically forgiven amount front, likely get approved actual loan, maybe get decline take it.

I would start believing now. Lold what's point this? one gather, 18-22 year olds can't gather extra? forced college close? Classes certainly must mean gathering. police stop check IDs think look young anywhere near another person? many people considered gathering?

And must allowed work then? there's rent freeze anything like that, fair all? people need work pay rent college costs bills.

I fail see alternative banning 18-22 year olds gathering one allowed leave house all. There's obviously middle ground there. there's already ban parties, enforce ban. maybe educate kids instead throwing rules regulations punishing time. Punishment really change behavior. 

Also see two weeks. start back moment over. virus may 2 week incubation period, people get infected 2 weeks still continue on. 

Opening college problem. cannot bring thousands young adults together atmosphere promotes social gatherings without spreading. possible. always take job essential worker then. mean...you seem sort know saying ridiculous. REALLY understand bat-shat insaane is? countries world killing people, lying deaths, tanking economy dropping GDP 10% half-year.....to hurt Trump? 
 
Here's thing, people joked trump people like cult. getting scary. shit insane cult-like getting scary. really bad things end happening.
 
Anybody could actually believe impervious facts, logic, reality, that's scary. add already said, person confirmed case covid-19 following instructions recommendations given actually breaking law could face legal action. case someone working retirement home tested positive covid-19 still kept going work. found fired effective immediately police investigation. fact worked elderly especially unfortunate would matter worked with, exclusive healthcare. ""just recommendations"" many want portray it. literally isn't. Trumps - COVID recovery help Americans- hope benefitted much corps deaths doubling every seven days now. Fauci said ‚Äòrecovery ‚Äò isn‚Äôt going happen late 2021. timeframe mentioned sources well it‚Äôs blurring together point. assume word recovery used mean either successful vaccine herd immunity. Thank God! Someone common sense. Yes! likely need one shot, plus lot easier store leading candidates. Fingers crossed. Covid-19 surveys racist? Everything becoming racist nowadays. defund rapidly decrease racism? time machine? go back Spring?   Kissing probably less dangerous long conversation singing together, virus spread easily via direct inhalation, saliva exchange, bind ACE2 receptors lot prevalent lungs mouth. (See infection also depend symptom severity. True asymptomatic cases infected 0.3% close contacts, compared average 3.7% cases 6.3% severe cases. See Risk infection spouses found 27.8% according Table 3 ""Family Secondary Attack Rate"" COVID I‚Äôm even sure herd immunity possible. long haul Covid many like me. Enough it‚Äôs starting raise concerns make (small) headlines. I‚Äôve sick since beginning March. one knows causes estimation take long time do. Iran Russia consistently reporting covid deaths numbers similar countries. sure talking about. Interesting sub downvotes pretty simple math.  Florida isn‚Äôt even republican it‚Äôs definition swing state, lmao sorry didn‚Äôt ask born  Nope New York cuomo Try different brand. may may itself.  know say. smell woman's perfume man's B.O. smell COVID well. makes sense agree! actually tried looking news sources/ information making comment.  


I clearly remember back March US family 15-20 stranded island demanding US embassy evacuate them.  
This story sounds pretty similar. 


And back March amount people asking whether cancel travel plans enormous. Worse far less people die many counted cases wern't walking around wern't typhoid Marys indeed were. Spreading around name ""I feel fine, able hang many people want!""

It may less lethal general deaths per case basis, still, hundreds thousands people dying needed to, still problem, simple mediation methods fairly easy, many feeble minded them, particularly made look less contagious actually was. Yup, hell old people. Seems Sweden‚Äôs strategy. Roughly 1 7,000 people? Hmmm.... stock market often looked bellwether economy large doing, really indicator investor sentiment form gambling.

TIL retirement money gambling /s

I mean, sense *could* lose it, that's gambling deciding live. state US counts covid deaths differently. Many require positive covid test assumed actual numbers higher. everyone dies tested. states allow covid counted deaths caused related illnesses (such pneumonia, collapsed lung etc) persons thought presumptive positive. states strict, requiring cause death ruled covid. Many death certificates say specific cause fluid lungs pneumonia, even person covid may directly related death. would they?

The money longer free fired anyone either government gets money back (interest payments) everyone kept jobs. 

That goal loans. ensure everyone kept jobs. 

Who cares happens cash long role keep getting paid. still wait data, result people walking around getting virus. exactly behave :D 
Why heck need vit. 3 years? forgotten Lombardy football match, Biogen conference etc. pandemic fuelled superspreading events. everyone would limit social contacts visits crowded indoor places people dont wear masks virus spread much. Live posted think alter boys get vaccines first, that‚Äôs Others wait two weeks booster data used helps. Next 4 6 weeks see lot early stage 3 data including Pfizer next week hitting first four reads. Oh yeah, fresh chicken completely wiped too. Like...why?  Ugh. Big difference. Kids seat tables 6 feet apart. cohort system allow social distancing. Look blended model many districts. Also, kids less susceptible virus objectively need education. cannot wait kids return school next week. virtual education sucks. heard patriot act? Actually all. 

The PPP loans stipulated taken one could laid furloughed. 

So firms paid money people also kept jobs. 

So PPP loans exactly supposed do. live world reported number cases wrong, reported number deaths spot accurate? How'd accomplish mental gymnastics? Look, insulted you, despite epically incorrect. save smirk election day. realize commen DT ever will, really give sh** you, you, children, partner, parents, etc... live die, garbage fact called supporters DISGUSTING PEOPLE, know that?

See college football covid argument: NFL play adults adn players made thier adult choice, college players can't kids, yet time able profit likeness adults excelling craft. That's even close lol purposefully miss point, instead try make point.

This sort talking about. Perhaps referring to. know why, chuds lockdownskeptical subs like force.

This election season astroturfing getting marching orders, even mods too. fly man youre good say 20 % Stockholm immunity doesnt imply homogenous spread meaning every 5th person Covid-19, evenly spread whole city.

You're desperately grasping straws brought unemployment, lol wtf Well, didnthey think going happen specify money used for?

Oh, knew would happen? care legalised corruption US politicians?

Makes sense. declare covid spread aerosol right now? US CDC, authoritative infectious disease organization world, agrees covid spread aerosol. think American CDC working together cover up? Americans lying?

It really matter believe, long advocate countermeasures proven effective. Right that. But, demonstrated case WHO, even April advocating *against* countermeasures already proven effective Korea, PRC, ROC etc. definition job accusation China prevented flights country make sense me. lot foreigners living China. flights essentially evacuation foreigners. China prevent people leaving home countries? holding hostage kidnapping?

Well, let people provinces go home too? situation bad requires closing big industrial centre like Wuhan, drastic measures taken beginning, yes, also keep foreigners quarantine. is, purpose quarantine, let people spread Countries like Korea also neighborhood, pretty well following conventional advice.

Wrong, also went recommendations, e. g. mandating masks recall, Korea never banned flights China either.

Are arguing banning flights heavily infected countries sensible move? countries default policy now. E. g. PRC certainly lost time ban flights US, virus flared there. good idea May July, surely even better idea December, ROC started issue flight measures these? Mask wearing? Social distancing?

The advocate mask wearing though long time, see, even April. course since made conventional methods, pioneered anyone particular.

I agree, closing borders, social distancing wearing masks nothing groundbreaking, common sense. said even baffling ever thought good idea argue two three.

So, reiterate, plenty decisions blamed for, no, done job well. better job US government, yes, incredibly low bar. title misleading, course essential workers access testing, they've access testing while. Anyone whose team owner however, cattle essential. state (and many states) Kindergarten requirements meaning 4 5 year old required law attend. I'm stay home mom former teacher.

Meanwhile Florida currently ranked 15th terms per capita I'd rich, *obviously* work hard enough. I‚Äôm sorry, I‚Äôm allergic Marxist language, forcefully taught USSR decades, haven‚Äôt lead country anything good. Belarus still fighting populist ideology right now. Work equation depends local considerations.

Either strategy reopen schools keep schools close vaccine simply bad strategy. need balance circumstances public health risk versus risk kids missing school.

People keep talking as-if we're dealing binary conditions. places US likely safe schools reopen, obviously many not. Anyone got nonpaywall? PPP lol funniest shit I‚Äôve seen day Dude, NZ -13% welcome exercise much caution see fit, onus scientific institutions like IHME make reliable, epidemiologically sound projections regarding course pandemic. 

As stands, January prediction likely mark much 150 thousand unless see sudden, major shocking reversal current trends. That‚Äôs acceptable. projections used guide shape public policy. 

Unless course name rhymes Ronald Frump literally need told world ending lift finger. case, fair enough guess. New Cases increasing since September 1 mean virus magic. much likely regular, mass testing strictly enforced quarantine policies eliminate virus, mass breakouts hidden away, given life pretty much back normal China. 

I doubt there's literally 0 cases China that's likely havent detected, officials hiding them. mean literally reported 2 cases soon found quarantined hundreds people it. They're political pressure lie contrary every reason alert public traces found, like now. They've while, think resurging news honestly pretty desperate blood donations right now. Let lesson politicians need smarter corporations. Complain take advantage, allow happen again. point need realize bank robbers always exist eventually makes sense start blaming bank constantly leaving vault open unguarded. Right point something safely possible. Maybe kids can't stay home parents work something like that. That's much common sense 2020  age anything? I'm 40 that's asking. Dude, Sweden 8.6% GDP drop, 5,800 dead. Again, like best comparison available, suggest own, look that. 

Still waiting suggestions countries compare Sweden to. like read comment, like said, made narrative point actually was. Wild MN asked help. residents going treat people. disgusting. Here's latest case/death charts North Dakota, running 7-day 7-day charts show pretty severe spikes.

North Dakota currently ranked 35th per capita get coming from, also remember kind viral pneumonia debilitating middle-aged older. white collar professionals office jobs physically disabled months may big deal, blue collar hands-on laborers (many ppl color higher risk contracting covid), may financially crippling. may disabled years since tech degreed skills office work. concentrate mortality miss bigger picture, especially impact vulnerable lower-wage workers. maybe deal shit time wearing masks trump Dont Mess europe. locking choosing money people something United States would do. Shut countries save lives Fox affiliate station, Fox News. worry. He's ordered extra bodybags meet expected demand... Great! least getting paid time. I‚Äôm proud you. expect argue someone posts 5 ridiculous coronavirus conspiracy subs? Lol. need balance public health risk stands area, versus legitimate concerns getting kids back school.

Just b/c much US completely fucking first point, mean second point also valid concern. Told ya. scared f upped economy big time Netherlands dramatically better Sweden.

The others mention among worst nations world pandemic responses. Belgium's response might bad appears, since they're among rare countries world might *over counting* pandemic deaths. world isn‚Äôt US. Everyone else trying cooperate. parents flu vaccines hear might help reduce potential chance surge hospital bed usage. best course action take? treat flu like COVID year particular continue mask socially distance myself? I'm particularly worried health (I'm healthy young man), I'm mainly worried others hospital system. saw COVID surge back June. you‚Äôre ignoring fact many countries world vast majority people wearing masks socially distancing happily best ability nobody issue it.Maybe whatever backward country that‚Äôs main issue, isn‚Äôt 99% people wearing masks socially distancing. guess what? Wearing mask trying 2m away everyone doesn‚Äôt actually Stop virus genius doable lot cases.

the virus still coming back unfortunately restrictions put place, like curfews, visiting people, work restrictions etc. things really affect peoples lives people right annoyed about.

The reality is, restrictions place damage jobs, economy, education etc would likely worse. Health services would become overwhelmed, people wouldn‚Äôt able go work en masse due sick on. would substantial rise deaths.

Fuck retarded state. really hope cause second Trump term addition second coronavirus wave. Interesting, thank you, wonder well would translate real life situations. said death **rate**. thought obvious can't compare deaths per day one population 7X larger other. apparently ""science"" buff know that.

Let break using numbers **you provided**. 

CT: 2 deaths day/ 3.5 million people = .000054% chance dying covid day

FL: 177 deaths day/ 21.5 million people = .00008% chance dying covid every day.

So difference almost nothing 3 month lock difference .000026% per day. That's worth financial collapse mental health risks. cant read?

Specifically Senate, currently may operating want, great value set up. 

Specifically me, Senators likely pragmatic branch government represent entire state. Representative districts gerrymandered point extremes party win. 

Senate perfect, think alternative many negative unintended consequences.

Seems reasonable anyone already suffering lockdown fatigue. jinx it. constantly shock people *still* making mistake. completely failed educate situation *six months*? probably removed dumb question.

1) Masks meant stop virus. meant stop liquid airborne vapors carry virus, like spray cough sneeze.

2) well known cloth masks shit. people try layer (4 layers). 

3) Methane molecule 30 times smaller virus. Idk got numbers from. Except opposite: trying minimize pandemic, pushing political discourse, getting comments deleted mods, ultimately bitching unfair sub downvoting ignoring agenda.

Good luck favorite thing work coming home family I'm afraid spreading virus since work public. I've distanced self bit safe side makes sad. Thank understanding. Everywhere go, people divided. throw rock miss Karen, I‚Äôll accidentally hit someone mask. doesn‚Äôt matter it‚Äôs Ohio, Florida, ‚Äúposh European city‚Äù. Stupid sprinkled everywhere, permeated even finest utopian societies. got Covid they've badgering come back 4 days despite still showing symptoms. exhausting saying one vaccine good bad. see happening state states try ban vaccine review (not sure legally) cause significant interstate travel desperate people try get vaccine, vaccine even useless. Desperation need hope outweigh logic may situations people react.

Assuming false vaccine cause people potentially spread disease allowed people get even useless since travel would happened.

Yes would get bad vaccine think immune spreading way still Cuomo cause deaths Imho New Zealand done everything right year deserve this, global economy affects everyone. Brexit yes that's trustable person.. treatment well supported preventing deaths/multi-organ failure sepsis standard care many facilities. Patients receive high doses IV vit. C (some protocols add thiamine corticosteroids well) seems prevent inflammatory processes contribute death sepsis decreases overall morbidity.  really anything new treatment well-studied.  Can‚Äôt even talk violent revolution anymore ***Yes*, last 2021. *Yes*, celebrate holidays alone masks on.**

What makes *really* depressed way. Ugh, patient?! established well-defined goal locking everywhere vaccine outset. Remember ""18 months"" Neil Ferguson? case, could actually got back normal November, *completely* normal Christmas new year.

Unfortunately, point, we've screwed pandemic response much, reopened prematurely, *even vaccine get us back normal*. followed directions first time, maybe still suffering closures mask mandates September. 

You know, matter fact, done start Victoria, Australia right now. They've got really good pandemic response, possibly even best world. 

* They've strict, continuous lockdown ever since July. Also, instead shifting reopening date every month so, common United States, they've given pre-emptive estimate *at least Christmas*. helps prevent skeptics accusing ""shifting goalposts"" - something see lot countries.
* lockdown *long*, *hard*, too. Unlike *anywhere else* America, *real* lockdown. Like, one farther 5 km homes.
* Gatherings completely question.
* require masks everybody.
* Schools reopened nearly year (and counting).

Finally, police strictly enforces everything. *This* tantamount crushing curve. one whines ""defunding police"" ""freedumb"". Rather, everybody unites together achieve common goal defeating virus. 

Unified leadership, strict ""no-exceptions"" enforcement restrictions, clear messaging places like China Victoria successfully crush curve, whereas places like U.S. U.K. cannot. fewer cops patrolling streets rule-breakers, less likely people going comply. Without compliance, guidelines *meaningless*.

(By way, I'm referring specifically *Victoria*, nowhere else. South Korea. Wuhan. ***Victoria***!)

I know. lot denial. **But that's way going be. Accept new normal, *or whine like coward*.**

EDIT: u/IncomeIdea, meant say ""into 2021"", ""after 2021"", thanks catching that.

EDIT 2: **Dislikes??** Rofl, yeah, countries like NZ Finland filled violently oppressed citizens. Even Sweden lockdown incurred extra debt part stimulus. actually rather achievable government bothers looking citizens. socialist issue fact people going get evicted kids issues getting food lack school lunch programs businesses obligation pay already wealthy struggling. explain system works make less fucked hard working people get passed people even fucking need money. CCP bots going field day thread That‚Äôs what‚Äôs scary me. sounds like death might better cases. That‚Äôs mainly government agencies. reality, private companies free allocate funds however like, provided legal means.

Why organization would this, risk pay back higher interest loan, little confusing though. loans originally intended assist small companies lost lot revenue due lack demand across board. 

The idea made right reasons, like always, government completely botched simple process greed incompetence.  Student parties banned lot universities US. 

This work. Students still party. Sometimes get caught suspended whatever, still partying, they're college kids! Thinking going party unrealistic. Butcher Hannover, Fritz Haarmann, killed 27 boys young men, disposing toilet outside apartment, Liene river black market. citizens Hannover knew years children disappearing Fritz worked volunteer police force, needed volunteers financial situation Germany time. police refused act reports Fritz uhm, issue, black market dealings, case best soft-spoken about. find (possibly translation the) interviews him, strongly suggest read them. Again, thank providing these. hero. Don‚Äôt let make feel like choice happened. isn‚Äôt spread via gas ass. It‚Äôs spread via aerosolised vapour mouth nose caught mesh masks.  sources criminal charges regulation prior year payroll condition? whole argument. didn‚Äôt know masks would work stop spread then! reason told people go buy them.. said that. Jesus nvm. I‚Äôm really done now. Thanks elaborating thinking going usage funds. good read, though know well enough say accurate. There's lot mis-understanding going on, true, also wanted point tell type fraud/wealth transfer occurred funds future given protections placed money lawmakers time, certainly less past.

I think people implicitly worried about, even specify articulate it. Legitimate use funds - like contractual obligations - passes muster most, assume. However, given administration's position pursuing fraud -- neutering CFPB, removing regulations, etc. -- think worry protections placed funds good teh ability enforce them.

If nobody enforces regulations restrictions -- durable corporations know -- rightfully frustrating. shutdown stop epidemics sure, unsustainable longer period time. Economically socially. idea locked vaccine absolute madness, people would rebell two months. Man, making grateful job electrician. I‚Äôve never really changes career since whole thing started. I‚Äôm still working ton 50 hour weeks, I‚Äôm used breaking back work lol haven‚Äôt noticed anything. see here, need avoid customer service costs. number cases isn‚Äôt increasing though. Nationwide it‚Äôs (almost weirdly) flat month 40-42k cases per day. Testing gone lot period, true infections probably actually gone down, that‚Äôs different discussion. 

Given flat number cases, it‚Äôs unequivocal good news share young cases increasing. young perhaps 1000x times likely survive old, ideally trend continues. see opposite headline - ‚Äúthe elderly largest share cases‚Äù - I‚Äôll discouraged. Hopefully lot lower 4.6% outpatients, although sadly apparently lot folks died home without making ER.

And kudos you. neighbor ICU nurse working 5 x 12 hr shifts every week months, even treating COVID-19 patients. please tell point I've missed? Oh wait, vacuous reply. Shocker. good news? 20 new cases single city good news? *countries* go months without new cases. far fallen? whole time. I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôve helped become aware Covid brutal. got sense trying make point ‚Äúthey gonna die anyway.‚Äù Hard imagine sort sicko would that, right? fully believe split developing speak America. Either trending upwards wealth prosperity, become toiling member underclass. 

Middle class eliminated. Personally, I'd could make sure upper class never line becoming distinct. Frankly admit don‚Äôt know linked report. found significant correlation, haven‚Äôt actually causation yet , although suspect drug help regulate RAAS pathway could go haywire severe infection. people sub dont agenda, they're legitimately concerned wellbeing humans.

Bullshit. agenda, downvoted questions facts. didnt twist facts buddy

Sorry, posted objective wrong info, Perhaps might want actually read peer reviewed articles 

I suggest same. need sort north west first. Local lock downs ineffective UK. worked open kitchen would come wearing mask 100¬∞ line. watched customers went grateful us reopening tipping sending thank cards customers coming mask, 20 tops ordering 300$ wedding reception tipping 2$. Karens complaining creme brulee cold, mid rare steak still pink, wants gluttonous fries gluten free burger.

The last restaurant worked also care employees covid. see temp check station sanitizer employees, one bathrooms. couple people show symptoms covid got sent home 72 hours Washington law. testing required!?

And top none restaurants want give people raises. Last place supposed give one guy .75$ raise least. got 25 cents. I've helped run kitchen knew labor costing 3k dinner service making 22k. could afford give shit.

So yeah, little burnt out.. Ok ok what's pandemic ? ....asking friend somehow managed miss every point guy made still claim rational person current climate. Crazy. First I‚Äôm sure assistant manager could hit $100,000 even bonuses. bonus would literally salary cases personally never heard assistant getting bonus anywhere remotely near that. cases hourly bonuses end equaling even paying someone‚Äôs yearly bonus. Co-managers maybe could ran perfect store still incredibly unlikely. Bonuses dependent customer reviews. took factoring everyone would better bonuses. way many 1 star reviews nothing store absolutely tank everyone‚Äôs bonuses. read review yesterday along lines ‚ÄúEveryone friendly got needed Walmart‚Äù 1 Star. think sticking company taking money everyone‚Äôs bonus. Get rid customer reviews tied bonuses. 

My opinion, is, payment restructure keep some, all, prior raises. think Walmart pays fairly positions doesn‚Äôt reward long career well. 10 year associate making brand new hire new minimum wage goes effect. isn‚Äôt even remotely fair. store full 10+ year associates would taking home money kept raises top pay restructures done. they're paying dividends stock buybacks, companies loans supposed go to. understand think thought out, real reasons would happen increase cases deaths, don‚Äôt think restrictions outside closing indoor restaurants gyms.

Plus divided nation protest anything close type stay home orders enacted March April.

This definitely could happen next year new presidential administration new congress, would result massive economic depression far worse results actual virus itself. That's cool think objective truth House Democracts represent interests say do. Total lockdowns aren‚Äôt going happen US, people would riot within week. I‚Äôve taken smoking CBD. Better nervous break down, am‚ÄôI right? Lol mad? Nice username oh /r/politics poster too; guess know real human garbage is. ü§£ü§£ü§£ Again, guy Swedish. Australian make angry.

Genuinely asking want better understand point view. said best case scenario said many months September. closer date better projection be. sure hard concept grasp. Feel free keep living life pessimistic view want I‚Äôd put money vaccine receiving EUA end year. eldest 3, turning 4 December, supposed start kindergarten year. Nope, way we're that.

Government scientific advisers braced first vaccine gains regulatory approval partially effective considering explain country need caution introduced.

Boris Johnson previously said countries need ‚Äúwork together build impregnable shield around people achieved developing mass-producing vaccine‚Äù.

Professor Chris Whitty, chief medical officer England, believes science eventually ‚Äúride rescue‚Äù early inoculations unlikely protect everyone virus continue circulate.

A jab cuts risk people falling seriously ill would huge advance, reducing deaths high-risk groups lessening disruption services cancer treatments.

But experts say would enable immediate return normal life. Professor Whitty believes Covid vaccine comparable flu jab, 40 60 per cent effective, realistic, Oxford team leading vaccine race set minimum target 50 per cent protection.

Experts say vaccine reduces symptomatic Covid cases half would immensely valuable tool. However, caution people expect first generation vaccines ‚Äúsilver bullet‚Äù.

While government believes vaccine ready use first half next year, restrictions still needed millions people injected social distancing may remain even afterwards. extent measures would depend well vaccine works.

It likely people need initial vaccine booster shot month later. may require doses two entirely separate vaccines stimulate immune system sufficiently.

‚ÄúIt depends find,‚Äù government source said. ‚ÄúIt seems likely outcome short medium term find vaccine, two doses vaccine, reduces severity symptoms. It‚Äôs possible might need several vaccines ‚Äî backing lot horses.‚Äù

The government agreed buy 500 million doses six different vaccines.

Charlie Weller, head vaccines Wellcome Trust, said first Covid vaccines likely limited effectiveness measures still likely required control infections.

‚ÄúWe need manage everyone‚Äôs expectations first frontrunners vaccines actually do,‚Äù Dr Weller said.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs lot hope, understandably, resting vaccine going wonderful one dose \[that give\] full lifetime immunity move us back normality next day ‚Äî it‚Äôs going perfect solution; it‚Äôs going silver bullet.‚Äù

She warned: ‚ÄúThey likely provide full immunity fully effective every age group every person. That‚Äôs big ask ‚Äî you‚Äôre 100 per cent effective every age group every person. it‚Äôs likely won‚Äôt get that.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe might get vaccine that‚Äôs 50 per cent effective, might get vaccine prevent disease, might prevent transmission person person. might also get vaccine safe majority adults, let‚Äôs say, may suitable everyone every underlying condition, whether that‚Äôs diabetes asthma something else.‚Äù

She added: ‚ÄúWe need carry focusing therapeutics vaccines won‚Äôt solve everything.‚Äù

Experts think unlikely Covid vaccines achieve known sterilising immunity, infection completely blocked.

Dr Claire Waddington, clinical lecturer vaccinology infectious diseases University Cambridge, said: ‚ÄúIt probably going hard get vaccine interrupts transmission level you‚Äôd want hug granny infected ‚Äî that‚Äôs high bar vaccine meet.‚Äù

The target set trials Oxford vaccine 50 per cent reduction number people catch Covid go develop certain symptoms. trials counts positive case positive test somebody one serious symptom, pneumonia diagnosed chest x-ray falling blood oxygen levels mean need help breathe.

Alternatively case counted positive PCR test accompanied two less serious symptoms, new cough, muscle pain fatigue interferes everyday life.

Pascal Soriot, chief executive AstraZeneca, drugmaker partnering Oxford, said week ambition exceed 50 per cent target, set regulators United States.

However, even vaccine reduces transmission, 50 per cent level efficacy may make difficult achieve herd immunity, enough people community protected virus prevent explosive growth infections.

Less 10 per cent Britain estimated infected therefore may immunity. estimated 60 70 per cent would protected achieve herd immunity.

‚ÄúIf 10 per cent immune 90 per cent not. vaccine ‚Äòprotects‚Äô half reach 55 per cent,‚Äù Ian Jones, professor virology University Reading, said. ‚ÄúIn remaining naive population infections continue hugely reduced rate.

‚ÄúSo virus limps along time adding immune population. achieve 100 per cent immunity? No. get flu-like situation? Yes ‚Äî vanishing endpoint community transmission deaths, probably seasonal, epidemic wave ended.‚Äù

**Virus ‚Äòhas mutated spread faster‚Äô** 
In February year, single protein spike surface single coronavirus single mutation. virus infected someone, spread (Tom Whipple writes.)

That variant, containing difference one amino acid, conquered world, leading suggestions virus may evolved transmit better.

Researchers Britain United States mapped spread mutation, known Spike 614G variant, shown pushed versions virus predominate. way achieved that, though, remains unclear.

Viruses mutate time mutations make difference behave. study 2,500 viral genomes shows March outbreak England seeded different version virus, known 614D. June, almost cases 614G. observed countries.

The fact 614G successful suggests found way spread survive better. theory, virologists believe evolutionary pressure viruses increase rate transmission decrease severity ‚Äî dead human good virus.

The study, researchers universities across Britain, found difference disease severity among two variants. surprise ‚Äî scientists believe relatively low death rate coronavirus makes likely would evolve spread faster rather milder. Laboratory tests shown infected cells seems produce viral particles faster.

When tested theory real world, looking growth clusters, evidence ambiguous. Writing peer review *MedrXiv*, said possible dominance chance.

‚ÄúWhether current explosive epidemics across world degree driven 614G, whether simply beneficiary right place right time, dominant variant,‚Äù said.

They added critical understand virus changing better. ‚ÄúChanges transmissibility circulating virus could major effect pandemic planning effectiveness pandemic response.‚Äù Chernobyl done analysis 12 countries higher per capita death toll Sweden lack?

## Abstract

**Introduction:** Chloroquine hydroxychloroquine widely used long-term treatment connective tissue disease usually considered safe. However, chloroquine- **hydroxychloroquine-related cardiac disorder rare** severe adverse event, lead death. 

**Results:** Eighty-six articles identified, reporting individual cases short series, providing information 127 patients (65.4% female). majority patients treated chloroquine (58.3%), remaining treated hydroxychloroquine (39.4%), succession. **Most patients treated long time (median 7 years, minimum 3 days; maximum 35 years)** **with high cumulative dose (median 1235 g hydroxychloroquine 803 g chloroquine).** Conduction disorders main side effect reported, affecting 85% patients. non-specific adverse cardiac events included ventricular hypertrophy (22%), hypokinesia (9.4%), heart failure (26.8%), pulmonary arterial hypertension (3.9%), valvular dysfunction (7.1%). 78 patients reported withdrawn treatment, recovered normal heart function (44.9%), others progression unfavorable, resulting irreversible damage (12.9%) death (30.8%).

Way toxicity Aspirin. Nah buy it.

The argument seems ""Sweden better nations."" 

And therefor done better somehow failed corrupt men.

In actual fact Sweden seems pretty standard middle pack result among countries hit hard.

And obviously realize that, thats allowed compare finland norway. (It use denmark too, seem second go sm√∂rg√•sbord suck.) forgot /s chief scientist Chinese Center Disease Control Prevention. definitely could bullshit. knows. Welcome job. risks everyday. could get crash work. going ‚Äúcry‚Äù too? Yeah that‚Äôs fair. People nice respectful, receptive help breath fresh air, unfortunately small minority. People think HIPPA means privacy silly. clue many people see medical records, SSN, address, etc. protect people requesting receiving it, even so, damn piece paper preventing rogue employees sharing. Sweden used political tool spread misinformation people would stop caring. Yet people calling lockdown NZ last month (despite group restrictions 100 'lockdown' period), ergo point. term vague - country calls lockdown might necessarily called one another despite similar measures. really dont get goverment didnt rip power becamw clear full nutjobs.

Like Denmark similar situation health agency refused call lockdowns. Thankfully Denmarks leader told get stuffed. ‚ÄúOther countries give shit‚Äù. don‚Äôt care country live government gives 0 shits you, sooner realize better.

Government systems indifferent processes meant take care societal problems deemed necessary voters representatives.

That said, guy clarified system place sounds exactly like disability leave, many jobs already have. agree would nice made mandatory employers give benefit. Hopefully. Sort Southern Hemisphere saw winter year.  way prove especially new reporting structure. denying something clearly don‚Äôt understand it‚Äôs easier think doesn‚Äôt exist. virus taken nearly one million lives. Possibly more. can‚Äôt comprehend people brush off. explaining ill informed. Fauci admitted lied. said people wouldn‚Äôt rush buy masks. didn‚Äôt say wasn‚Äôt sure worked. course n95 works. That‚Äôs for. Insert ""Can't tell serious"" meme here. lots nice spots, like eucalyptus forests, rivers, farmlands, bays beaches. time China using rushed PPE. enough spared export. That's response. bunch.of ungrateful assholes. going counterpoint, verbage rude say least. can't 100% accurate (even though rather mean). 

Half us trying best convince half, darn impossible. Asimov said best:

# ‚ÄúAnti-intellectualism constant thread winding way political cultural life, nurtured false notion democracy means 'my ignorance good knowledge.'‚Äù Yah I'm sending kids preschool. That's dumb idea right now. Totally understandable. minor inconvenience compared Covid human body. 

I think ridiculous people supposed adults throwing fits required wear mask stores. 

And fake medical excuses drive nuts. doctors, nurses surgeons asthma wear masks long periods time issues. Teacher here. Before, after, times during. cool detention facilities families want gather? Seems so.

It's obvious side much subreddit falls - forceful imprisonment, ultimate state authority name public health, total loss freedom associate friends family.

And idiots scream ""You think virus hoax! need like China!""

Fear hell thing. ability remove dignity people startling.

I hope hysteria dies people come senses, look back time deep shame, enough, thinking could blame human nature instead virus - ultimate misplacement blame. Kroger stopped Hero Pay like two months, opted ‚ÄúThank Bonus‚Äù like ‚ÄúFuck Bonus‚Äù. $200 part-time $400 full-time split two payments. Except part-time scheduled full-time hours keep pandemic, got fucked receiving low end check. 

That bonus ever got, bonus equal 5 weeks Hero Pay. agree Covid would deadlier someone jumped time machine introduced virus population 1918. problem virus wasn‚Äôt around back then.

There unproven belief enough circumstantial evidence indicate Covid created virology lab Wuhan. lab-created virus would happen 1918 since type technology exist time period.

The second, conventional theory virus originating wet market would also make nearly impossible originate 1918. Wet markets prevalent China back would extraordinary circumstance bat pangolin human transmission occur even attempt replicate infection patient zero would likely perish passing people.

This explained multiple times, Ill give short version. Lying knowingly misleading. know something works, saying, ""Don't evidence works"" lying. doing, however, misrepresenting historical fact, hospitals aren‚Äôt buying masks Home Depot

Oh, absolutely were, least home depot's suppliers. Note many doctors wearing valved masks surgical mask pics NYC got hit badly. still borders largely closed rest world. cannot enter EU Sweden too. Let's act like borders open.

Meanwhile, group restrictions NZ compared Sweden's 50. day working grocery store hard day stop progressing Governor said need light touch government. needs light case covid. surely realise though, never told whole truth anything right? Every parent kids follows adulthood governments revealing information had, normally avoid panic. argue immoral happens time. 

Imagine honest said masks super important. would people hoarding them, people panicking could get masks play right hands scammers profiteers. mention, would encourage stupid shit like people robbing masks hospitals doctors offices. 

So less ideal lie, better shitshow alternative. worried anymore..you .2 percent chance get coronavirus die..so worried..I still wear mask though. Hey, several friends IT, crap y'all put crazy! think call center jobs least LITTLE bit suck them, solely bc one calls call center, (no matter kind), without problem.

I take mask goggles breaks outside, never closer 20 feet away someone else. Nothing touch filters behind plastic. Sometimes need adjust mask touch plastic parts.

I diligent hand washing hands touch eyes, mouth, food water.

If get it, full proof way avoid covid without becoming hermit.

Fortunately, culture deferring experts places aggressive ignorance seen virtue. approach too. Hopefully jerk kid steal candy, plan putting incrementaly trick-or-treaters. get 50-75 kids year. Wonder average bonus C suite Somebody's buying  economies fine - China running full tilt right now. Large swathes East Asia back normal still wrestling restrictions body counts. dignity.

Be wary 'Texas strain' reports - Covid plenty contagious enough anyway, evidence variant mentioned less harmful.

This go disappear 'like flu', continue slaughtering way population take proper action. China etc shown us needs done, time stop arguing, get it. outbreak highlighted incredibly selfish people be. Seriously, wear mask following social distancing. hard. medical resident. Totally understand.

I knew risks got med school, expectations different. expected I‚Äôd take risks outbreak (Ebola outbreak happened school figured I‚Äôd help something like happened again), figured risks would calculated minimized. Right much risk grocery store hospital.

Patients don‚Äôt wear masks, argue people right thing room. one outside hospital taking precautions seriously enough.

I live alone, far home. exposure, can‚Äôt even tell family. risk catching come help me? No, I‚Äôd rather suffer alone know family got me.

I figure I‚Äôm going work pay loans move different field. don‚Äôt care people anymore, desire help anyone. still job treat people come in, invested them. Medicine become job nothing more.

Also, much respect hospital staff keep going. much respect workers aren‚Äôt healthcare still taking risks everyday. thank guys much, life would much harder guys weren‚Äôt work do. Americans! Color surprised. Turns France sent assholes. learn hardship. knew guy deliberately broke leg could learn like disabled while. said later lot growing 8 weeks learned himself. Masks sort excuse justify coming lockdowns, loosening unsustainable social distancing restrictions. 

Face it...an effective lockdown pretty much impossible United States, eventually gets point things start opening up. Masks sort happy medium. 

Plus, excuse leadership anything. mandate masks, say it‚Äôs people‚Äôs fault wearing masks, call job done. that's bad honestly..? 3200 get hate Trump, let's break bit.
 
While would Trump's interest (from perspective) vaccine ASAP, would interest vaccine ASAP ineffective and/or harmful.

Now jokes aside...

It sounds like one many people royally screwed pandemic, can't exactly take anger COVID, instead choose direct anger towards people seemingly affected much were. think anyone following laws, bylaws rules pertaining measures meant slow spread virus falls category people. think virus continue spread, actually people responsible destroying US economy they're ""afraid live life"". Maybe people pussies, could let virus sweep country carrying daily activities, business usual, thereby avoiding recession.

Nope, work way, that's topic another day.

Still, even can't wear mask, condition would absolutely make ideal follow social distancing. Again, that's something selfish people refuse and, unlike masks, there's literally **zero** excuse never convince anyone switch side.

This pretty disingenuous. person seeing many cases/deaths country still refuses follow measures keep country safely opened, there's virtually nothing say change make feel superior push others away.

Then add vindictive list person refuses wear mask jeopardize public health spite.

You correct incorrect....and here's why.

If seated right next index patient, cloud aerosols coming nose mouth, yes, filter help. Mask goggles yes. Filter no.

But let's say 18 feet away. 

The virus wafting mouth hole virus. coming part respiratory droplet, significantly larger virus size. respiratory droplet actually aerosol (100 nm size cut-off droplet (ballistic) true aerosols consisting water, salts, whole bunch things combine aerosol.

N95 masks work well actually catching respiratory aerosols.

Otherwise, every single Dr world would infected CoVid, N95‚Äôs work.

Merv13 work (essentially)...supertight woven material, multiple layers, combined electrostatic charge.

Anyway, aerosols get diluted overall volume air room.

And there's low ACH (&lt;1), emitted aerosols build concentration actual infectious dose reached.

What infectious dose? one knows sure.

But based infectious dose influenza , TB respiratory vector diseases, significantly one virion.

So, MERV13 filter better, removing respiratory aerosols air build infectious dose, prevent transmission.

Now...at point filter able keep up...for example ventilation particularly bad, multiple aerosol emitters, room volume small like closet.

But filters help...even box fan MERV13 filter house HVAC system strapped inlet side.

Dr. Jimenez, Dr. Linsey Marr, Dr. Shelly Miller aerosol scientists/IAQ experts extraordinairily communicative twitter feeds sorts things.

Cheers! say ""know strengths"" problem is, comments like (and others sub) extremely assholish. bunch people (me included) **is** hard wearing mask. still it, even mandatory here. flares (normally minor) claustrophobia get anxiety.

Just wholesale saying ""it‚Äôs hard"" isn‚Äôt you, never convince anyone switch side. make feel superior push others away. really ""let show arguments debunked"" comment. Human transmission evidence held back longer deniable, credible outside scientists involved, number reported deaths Wuhan credible. thus initial post's premise China's approach reliably transparent based science untenable. medical history private information might embarrassing.

Within dorm halls!!!? Spread spread. stupid. stupid shit Spreads stupid virus people gets people sick lengthening pandemic. reasons important people promoting end spread spread saying US Catholics *less* pro-choice before?

I‚Äôm saying right wrong, share experience is, seeking clarify. restrictions would prevent people working going school easily avoided people wear mask follow social distancing guidelines.
People would far less need quarantine community spread contained too. Want wager guess helps achieve that?

Have stopped moment thought reason might happening ""everybody except dumb selfish""? rarely good explanation anything. 

Do go work morning? take public transportation get there? tried follow social distancing bus 7:30 morning? Even wearing masks, that's dangerous, something pretty much everybody forced do. example.

Just ""news"" websites Reddit love put freak show give plenty space coverage refuse social distance wear masks, people feel smart superior, mean sizeable part population actually thinks masks dictatorship something.

There difference ""I protest want wear mask"" ""I protest fired"" ""please let keep restaurant open, go bankrupt"".

Just hint: thinking problem involving people, first step always assume people rational agents, least rational you, reasons things, they're ""dumb selfish"". 'very hard' wearing mask social distancing help country stay safely reopened everyone go work, school avoid quarantines?

Reread comment. point wearing masks social distancing easy part restrictions. parts, ones perhaps experiencing, hard ones.

Not everybody afford luxury staying home see anybody, privilege always situations 2 square meters personal space. society requires socialization interaction. unavoidable certain threshold. Let's fucking try understanding other. Based spike Summer 70,000 cases day, topped roughly 1,200 deaths day average shortly after. We'd see 150,000 confirmed cases *daily* even approach 3,000 deaths day. happening, unless someone fudges numbers, surprising. Maybe acknowledge virus experts better answers himself? also create function testing tracing program. believe me, take two minutes look website. everything here, appealing science hell lot better ""herd mentality"" Trump's trying for. It‚Äôs way communicating policy-makers, media, academics well, lapse like trivial. virus care religious mores. repeat: virus does.not.care religious mores.

Pretty simple. There's another side it, fair.

Nope. Stop spreading misinformation. 200,000 dead estimate 400,000 dead January. Stop making seem like light situation. I‚Äôve issue it‚Äôs tough.

Hospitalizations low begin with. Nobody concerned case counts, concerned hospitalizations deaths. point reducing severity 50% would drastically improve social situation. wouldn‚Äôt need restrictions point.

Doctors seeing huge increase patients shedding abnormal amounts hair, believe related stress associated coronavirus.


Annrene Rowe getting ready celebrate 10th wedding anniversary summer noticed bald spot scalp. following days, thick shoulder-length hair started falling clumps, bunching shower drain.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs many, many stresses many ways surrounding pandemic, we‚Äôre still seeing hair loss lot stress hasn‚Äôt gone away,‚Äù said Dr. Shilpi Khetarpal, associate professor dermatology Cleveland Clinic.

Before pandemic, weeks Dr. Khetarpal didn‚Äôt see single patient hair loss type. Now, said, 20 patients week come in. One woman difficulty home-schooling two young children also working home. Another second-grade teacher anxiously trying ensure students computers internet access online instruction.

In July survey post-Covid symptoms among 1,567 members survivors‚Äô group, 423 people reported unusual hair loss, according group, Survivor Corps, Natalie Lambert, associate research professor Indiana University School Medicine, helped conduct survey.

‚ÄúSome Covid, them,‚Äù said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs stress situation. apart families, worked many hours.‚Äù

For patients condition temporary, doctors say, could last months.

There two types hair loss pandemic seems triggering, experts say.

In one condition, called telogen effluvium, people shed much typical 50-to-100 hairs per day, usually beginning several months stressful experience. essentially involves shifting ‚Äútripping hair growth system,‚Äù said Dr. Sara Hogan, dermatologist David Geffen School Medicine University California, Los Angeles, seeing seven patients day condition.

In healthy hair cycles, hairs growing phase, small percentage short resting phase 10 percent hairs shedding telogen phase. telogen effluvium, ‚Äúpeople shedding more, growing less.,‚Äù Dr. Khetarpal said, 50 percent hair might skip ahead shedding phase, 40 percent growth phase.


The phenomenon, women also experience pregnancy, typically lasts six months, stressful situations persist recur, people develop chronic shedding condition, Dr. Hogan said. hair loss condition increasing alopecia areata, immune system attacks hair follicles, usually starting patch hair scalp beard, said Dr. Mohammad Jafferany, psychiatrist dermatologist Central Michigan University.

Not patients Covid-19, said, ones tended progress quickly one two bald patches ‚Äúlosing hair body,‚Äù including eyebrows eyelashes. said might storm inflammation Covid patients experience elevates immune molecules linked conditions like alopecia.

Experts don‚Äôt know exactly stress triggers conditions, affect women men. might related increased levels cortisol, stress hormone, effects blood supply, Dr. Hogan said.

The hair loss cause stress, Dr. Khetarpal said, especially women, whose hair often closely tied identity self-confidence.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs trademark,‚Äù said Mary Lou Ostling, 77, retired educator lives Stuyvesant Town neighborhood Manhattan. hospitalized Covid-19 eight days early spring later noticed ‚Äúmy hair started coming chunks,‚Äù said. ‚ÄúI always clearing hair comb, brush, sink.‚Äù

Ms. Ostling said also could tell hair wasn‚Äôt growing much wasn‚Äôt seeing roots contrasted color previously dyed it.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve always long, thick, curly hair,‚Äù said. July, ‚ÄúI simply lot cut off. couldn‚Äôt deal anymore.‚Äù

When came home hairdresser, said, ‚Äúmy husband staring me. said, ‚ÄòI think different wife.‚Äô depressing.‚Äù said finally begun detect hair growth.

Experts recommend good nutrition, vitamins like biotin stress-reduction techniques like yoga, scalp massage mindfulness meditation. also recommend minoxidil, hair-growth drug, Dr. Hogan warns patients initially cause hair loss starts working.


For people depressed traumatized hair loss, Dr. Jafferany recommends psychotherapy, necessarily medication antidepressants anti-anxiety medications exacerbate hair loss.

When Liz Weidhorn, 44, Fair Lawn, N.J., tested positive Covid-19 March, noticed members online Covid group bemoaning hair loss, told happened her, ‚ÄúI take grace I‚Äôll get kick-ass hat,‚Äù recalled.

But recently showering, ‚ÄúI looked wet hair could see much scalp,‚Äù said, ‚Äúand couldn‚Äôt believe emotional got.‚Äù cried called husband look it.

Dr. Hogan said patients find situation upsetting avoided washing brushing hair noticed hair loss activities. tells shouldn‚Äôt afraid normal grooming.

She added, ‚ÄúPatients don‚Äôt like say this, come around it: Hair crucial survival.‚Äù 21 family members get 3 weeks ago. went birthday party cousin(I didn‚Äôt go). days later younger cousins teacher tested positive covid went get tested(and everyone went party since close contact). positive 21 family members. 2 asymptotic. 2 showed symptoms cold like symptoms 2 days(just headache achey fever cough). feel like mass majority people don‚Äôt get sick sick don‚Äôt even get tested. cousins teacher didn‚Äôt test positive one would even gotten tested family! I‚Äôm sure numbers way off. lot people probably caught it! want go Florida, enjoy bars restaurants, since Mass many rules. stay hotel. make sense? listening anything say all? main reason believe second wave smaller Sweden we've kept measures place since start thing. fewer flu deaths US, though? hear time sub, I‚Äôve never given actual numbers. even fear one sick person, new normal behavior yelling politics, yelling masks, asking racist things check (you got blacks here? owned Americans?) management office us low ranks extra work make staying safe healthy home. guess lice isn‚Äôt medical condition? Idk. Personally agree principle apply‚Äîit‚Äôs important let others know try watch signs infection/infestation too. clean shower drain 5-6 times wash hair. Never wads hair come hands. days severe fatigue, several days stomach pains, two days feeling average, aches pains shoulders like flu since Covid March. turns asking students get tested incentives de-centives quarantine, school closing, ostracized, etc - work. I've spent much time seeing people exactly - making excuses try try get around irrefutable evidence want believe it. 

I've seen before, amounts facts change mind. I'm going waste time. 

Goodbye nice day. parents doctors Shandong province China. mandated get covid test every two weeks. It‚Äôs everything, dude. whole thing awful Yes, understand friends argue constantly numbers wrong guess concern it‚Äôs small school one kid absent, it‚Äôs easy figure ‚Äúculprit‚Äù is. also assumes there‚Äôs something wrong embarrassing corona.

Isn‚Äôt Gov. doctor? talking us cases, us president throw number safe assume mean us globally. whole fake misleading revel in. ‚ÄúTechnical‚Äù truths this? teach psychology. says know anything 100%? scientific process it'll take years get clearer picture. least tendencies numbers hundreds thousands people report something? radio, tv whatever, always see numbers actual humans supposedly this?

Well actually looked reports? Whether news outlets scientific ones? every report patients result new news coverage already covered least before? Probably not. see, science closing percentages comes long-term effects.

And feel actual long-term damage? Could could turn actual problem later line people report **CDC report** looked recovery rates people mild illness, **1 5 young healthy adults reported prolonged percentage covid-19 affected long-term don‚Äôt know sure, **multiple studies suggested approximately 10 percent people experience prolonged illness covid-19**. even fraction that, toll huge given 6.7 million people United States far gotten disease (and 30 million thought problem mask? different though covid19 fully airborne.

Also, probably got midwest last limited travel to/from low population density. Additionally, extreme heat associated summer seasonality effects south does. Quite simply, run course yet. ""nobody taking seriously!!"" situation. 

As noted elsewhere, cities pass mandates, Fargo requires masks, state's category fairly meaningless population. fundamental principle justice habeas corpus. don‚Äôt disappear you‚Äôre arrested. get lawyer court appearances, formally publicly charged. saying flies face decency. actually proposed congress (back dated $2k every month since March iirc) obviously went nowhere. yes, one 'P's' ""payroll"". main purpose keep people employed.

That said, dale63 right. used elsewhere, need repay it. used payroll (and met conditions) loans forgiven, free money.

In spirit fostering positivity, what's something positive thats occurred anyone week? think salary and/or bonuses evenly split low paid employees?

At Walmart, bonuses, managers make well $100,000 year. really sure specifics. hopefully enriching one requirements, foxes ones guarding hen house. 100% hippy is. Also, don‚Äôt tell kids get lice?  currently Job three people. Burn option. Either survive not. 2003 sars talking including coronavirus scientists believe may cause SARS, tiny easily pass barriers. Several studies even shown surgical masks fail prevent transmission much larger mycobacterium tuberculosis, causes TB. U.S. Centers Disease Control Prevention advises people SARS wear masks, even recommend people contact patients unless infected person can‚Äôt wear one. Wearing surgical masks outdoors, virus-laden particles easily disperse, even less value.‚Äú

So changed? Nothing except desire make political. ‚ÄúTrust scientists!‚Äù Why? lie well flip flop. Fauci told everyone masks don‚Äôt work early on.  debunked July. media moved on. Nothing see here.

People wouldn‚Äôt wear masks visit, kept trying move chairs closer. ban four people premises, finally thing got people stop morons saying moved closer resident would assume infected send home immediately. Legally questionable, selfishness finally overrode Facebook anti-mask programming apparently. 

It‚Äôs exhausting completely changed operate way makes way work us - zero home health/hospice support staff allowed inside, therapists, volunteers, intense cleaning regimen, fixing mechanical problems avoid outside contractors coming in, etc. - families aren‚Äôt even willing wear fucking mask stay put them. extremely vulnerable population 75% residents age 90. two age *100*. It‚Äôs miracle virus isn‚Äôt facility already, we‚Äôre adjacent major hot spot, true testament staff‚Äôs diligence home work, gets I‚Äôd bet *least* half population hospitalized that, die. otherwise stable residents probably 5-10 healthy years enjoy protect them. 

I haven‚Äôt left home except go get gas go deserted park six months. haven‚Äôt seen family person long, friends. don‚Äôt cry, I‚Äôm mad fuck time.

**I'm essential gloves surgical masks... disposable.** Guess Winter Coming. Interesting. could lead treatment approach using interferon, although side effects suck. formula

It pisses people stayed home getting $505 week state unemployment $600 federal total $1105 week. bring home less half privilege going work place biggest hot spot outside healthcare. people charge hide lie cases. claim keep workers informed. complete BS. people invoke comparisons Spanish Flu trying dismissive Covid-19.

You're probably one people refuse vaccine done Trump administration. I'm guessing stipulations soon repeat testing?  wish someone would tell nursing home street me.

This early panic phase covid around February worked Costco. working outside parking lot 8 hours day -30¬∞c lifting furniture pushing carts thick snow ice.

The thing saved got Covid-19 got take month off. stuck working August quit go back university full time. 

I'm much better place weight lifted shoulders made feel genuinely happy first time years Nah.

I went bar 20 people couple days ago.

I promise visit nursing homes. way! shock, corporations lining pockets fucking everyone process. Yes, wrote sarcasm, thats Ive seeing page article idiots believe it. Human behaviour spreads virus. That's change it, temporarily, there's effective vaccine.

Meanwhile: paragraphs still utter word empathy people kinda want kill. well proving-you-aren't-a-sociopathic-murderer thing far, chum. money given directly americans? Indeed are, business unfortunate. hoping pandemic would bring good people businesses done quite contrary. sad. What? I'm posting story respected news source. extrapolate want life go back normal? Ultra rich.

There plenty top 10% even 1% think they're going benefit shit.

News flash 10%: friends. benefit corruption. I'm afraid namedrop. worked Startek based SC 5 months last year. someone needs help signing ACT, actually reach ACT, reach makes $10.50/hr. makes call center horrible entire business based around chewing spitting people out. put effort retaining employees there's 3 new classes people ready take place every single week. 

Managers random people got promoted they're friends someone else, management experience training. calls maximum 30 seconds document two separate places happened call change phone's status get incoming calls someone walk literally tap shoulder tell get back on. means busy days might speak upwards 50 60 customers 8 hour shift. 

Hours awful, pay garbage, work environment dreary, customers rude(or lets real, incompetent), management condescending. wear masks right now? Yes. respect social distancing right now? Yes. requirements extend holidays? Probably. many companies pay dividends legally obligated so.

None companies went Congress ask let obligations. chose shareholders workers, like Made example .... Ecolab

Yeah dude, completely made argument ignores fact 75% PPP funds go maintaining payrolls really justification stock buybacks, since buybacks help want look misallocation tax dollars look pork barrel funds placed Covid relief bills nothing struggling businesses citizens.

Right, problem private companies defrauding government, public spending call pork barrel, though many would find necessary increases public spending pandemic. [Believe wonder many banned airline mask-refusal. I‚Äôve searching work least two years, even pandemic....and nothing wrong feel. Fuck anyone says otherwise. fear never safety socialize maskless. fact government shut entire city that, hospitals filled people begging doctors doctors nothing didn't, doctor screaming phone almost crying didnt, massive field hospitals erected contain virus didn't, guy went infected hospitals without much gear did? Pathetic.  Nothing easier wearing mask.  Reminds obese people complaining hard exercise is. said you? What's super exciting moved back parents family doesnt think serious. Cant wait holidays get hide away days everyones fuckin dumb. Sweden example :) kids. Thankfully, they‚Äôre school sub. Ha! Climate change stopped. way we'll ever stop largest polluters every country. Money always wins. hey, profits! I'm certainly done breathing strangers droplets rest life. Capitalism 101 approaching herd immunity initial failure protect elderly everything control free wearing masks basically opportunity gloat americans. treated equally regard vaccine. people get first people whose inoculation greatest impact spread virus, whether rich poor. exactly type person I'm talking about. Lots people want pursue passions, natural desire - everyone needs 40 hours guided tasks make happy. thing ""wrong"" working bookstore fact one 3 roommates afford it, fault economy rather individual. I'm - work remotely, want turn side work web development business. used work local thrift store getting back poor shit genuinely enjoyed job. loved easy pace, 60s-80s music intercoms, old people would come tell found item used kid. know I'd eventually get lonely fully remote work, part time wage okay, I'd absolutely side. leave live $9 hour. Wrong three.

Seek help. words, *money laundering* mean thing Admin said ""Don't worry it, trust allow safeguards PPP program""? wish true, are. blatant disregard well-being others startling rage-inducing me. Especially coming highly educated field, field built around science research, career choose help others. whole debate masks symptomatic UK terrible record vs COVID-19. situation even exacerbated US, take UK.

In UK NHS lacked sufficient PPE, likely political decision meant mandatory. Creating rush masks would mean would harder government secure NHS, fact several briefings featured Mr Hancock (Health Secretary) asking surgical masks saved need most. Stuck rock hard place, government make call.

Even now, advice mask 'face covering', slightly absurd. essentially telling public face covering, nature determined entirely individual, also acceptable. means thin cloth would qualify face covering, yet clearly would mitigate much risk actual mask. know you, trust general public wear adequate face covering.

If take zero tolerance approach COVID related death illness, mandate would masks sufficient quality mitigate risk transmission. Produce masks, distribute public, enforce usage. cares overkill? People dying risk long term heath issues. high magnitude risks, even likelihood getting small, impact could life changing. 

Now US, know start. fact Dr Fauci receiving end attempts discredit beyond pale. Culturally listen essentially one person entire country knows talking about, big problem.

I fortunate enough live Hong Kong recent political upheaval. Masks worn someone sick go office. someone sitting near office coughing away far less disturbing wearing mask. HK therefore healthy stock them, usage considered absolutely normal, obviously instrumental defeating SARS many years ago. said many countries SE Asia - e.g. Singapore, Japan, Malaysia etc. debate whatsoever 'do masks work'. claim backed country track record stemming pandemic.

I digress. US, reason masks recommended likely linked denial mircobiology. fortunate enough able use critical thinking look outside country, determine think true regardless country claiming, either government popular media. want know beat pandemic, refer credibility beating pandemic. know CDC run, claiming masks work? cannot imagine would claim straight face. last paragraph directed at.. Aka brig. Right wing breaks things don‚Äôt like. defend things do. No, know spreading asymptomatically, need widespread masking healthy people. light that, fact would cause run PPE, recommended additional information became available. argument. seem misunderstood. Shocking. known would previous events anyone surprised? larger companies could gotten without assistance, hey free money greedy pigs take it. wife teacher. cries work, work, work. Admin give shit treating schools like cheap daycare's. believe true. Controlling virus support economy. Imagine living country deep state agenda exasperate protests, make targeted arrests spread Covid among progressives. saying coming true, sure seems like could. spam.
They've made controversial statement (in words LIE), get us download crummy app. moved up. wanted see better management became change wanted see. too. I‚Äôm nothing special could much believe anyone can. Covid-19 virus continuing mutate throughout course pandemic, experts believing **probably** becoming contagious, coronavirus cases US started rise again, according new new US study analyzed 5,000 genetic sequences virus, continued mutate spread population. study find mutations virus made lethal changed effects, even **may be** becoming easier catch, according report Washington Post, noted public health experts acknowledge viruses mutations, insignificant.

*Probably* *may be* words describing certainty. Expert *assumptions* evidence asserted such. India's democratic nature largely compromised recent years institutions dancing tune party power.  old scumbag worked right college got pissant company 2MM PPP loan. magically he‚Äôs building 2nd beach house. Laid almost everyone aside kids. 

Where report fraud people supposed eat bread water? like take cry breaks lunch time, allows time sneak quick panic attack work maybe existential crisis afterwards. couldn‚Äôt keep school

out curiosity, homeschooling work then? folks avoid sending kids school years. Seriously get real learn live virus. I‚Äôm especially protect morons refuse vaccine. They‚Äôre own. Frustrating, entirely unexpected considering discovered virus 6-ish months ago. Yeah man! American President leader free world all. /devil's advocate I'll write down.

The ruling class get vaccines first, also first rights monitize vaccines.  keep bringing hate, said opinion hateful opposed conflicting opinion yours. someone emotion hate willing work emotion someone want America, hate comes somewhere may come justified place. hate America spending trillions bombing sand, giving citizens TBI's without fully coverage ""military actions"" private companies make profit. love America free speech expression, expressions emotive nature hate emotion. even someone hates America stay, understand correctly maybe find common ground here. someone hate directed processed resolving feeling, hating without action Like said, you‚Äôre crazy person don‚Äôt come America

You seem lot hate, like telling people label them. opinion counter 'they're crazy, love America gtfo' meanings behind views views built America Collective self sacrifice fellow man greater ideal. yeah point kinda broken record. Dozens studies conducted April peer-reviewed academic reports confirming published early last month. There's reason governor Ron-a Florida GOP everything keep ex-felons getting voting rights back, know smallest influx Dem voters sway state Blue heartbeat Corruption? Ya don‚Äôt say! 25% entire investment portfolio - 25% active positions.

You cannot compare buying alpha vs options *after fact* entirely different risk profiles.

If crystal ball, I'd options, obviously. ...with simple alpha play obvious dip (and leverage), brought several years closer retirement low risk exposure. 

I bought individual companies already believed in. Playing options small stack cash fine. Throwing life savings options stupid. works areas currently represented GOP politicians. Many places super, super safe the., Deep South, Midwest, Mountain West areas. voting solution, bigger trouble ever, voting changed fuck last decades. also places like Russia excess death numbers 300% official counts. Yeah much much worse world leading on. I'm sure difficult imagine actually valuing human rights. one asked opinion. Get people stop raping children lecturing others walking hypocrite dress. I'm glad guy's mother getting many visitors. They're presumably wearing masks masks required facilities people dementia dying droves due routines thrown support staff giving fuck basic upkeep. 

You're good little Redditor sounds like stay home seclude yourself. say essential workers working close proximity public time? huff bleach? deprived seeing loved ones? Given logic they're equally dangerous restaurant goers. Reddit, place rife bunch shut-in work home techies college students petrified notion going class, sad.  Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* sounds like false equivalence. 
 

Currently, masks shown slow spread virus. Full stop. provide evidence contrary, provide it. Otherwise creating new argument pull attention elsewhere.







To point...


I personally wash cloth mask regularly. gf brother. wear n95 week must go enclosed public space. regularly wash hands sanitize get car. 

Edit: structure Didn‚Äôt comment originally work aviation repair. big layoff I‚Äôm covering 3-4 different areas every day. raises, reduced overtime, expected cross training new areas without chance actually promoted. People fully trained Covid really fucked airline industry denied promotions raises earned. It‚Äôs fucked up. works coronavirus anything except prions. announce true positive rate rapid tests? feeling we‚Äôll get results fairly quickly one since it‚Äôs one done shot transported stored easily Greed, plains simple. long immunity last scenario? article says annual boosters likely required. don‚Äôt know answer. Take silver spoon, dig grave

-Fleetwood Mac mistaken post, course wrote accurate. Even knew that. know idea thought responding to, leaving original post deserve votes error. Abolish senate, let American people represented House Representatives. Make everyone‚Äôs vote count . minority rule Thanks! We‚Äôre gonna order transfer plating outside. we‚Äôll pop oven bit sure. 

I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm getting downvoted either? parents risk group everything safe. thanks understanding!! appreciate reassurance No, you‚Äôre drugs. Plaguesville nothing compared heroin addiction. Jeebus, sense perspective! Well sure, point PPP loans. keep people employed whatever circumstance business in. includes circumstance business well, able fire employees. example, businesses became automated sent jobs overseas.  
Finally, large corporations benefitted lockdown sent small businesses business. politician reads New York Times Washington Post knew lockdowns going benefit big businesses expense everyone else. Then, politicians supported lockdowns. Now, want pretend surpise. look conservative subreddit... brainwashed delusional folks ok point taken. Distancing though. hard run business reduced capacity. especially restaurant. people working person, industries, less risk somehow? That's around half demographic banned. yes, plenty places allow 18-20 year olds go bars, can't alcohol. mortals idea There's really fuckload info seems intentionally omitted story.

For one, article states ""people arrived March"" big example story talk family arrived January leaving March.

...Flights still running March, take flight then?

Article says husband ""lost job hotel March due falling tourism result COVID-19"" that's utter horseshit nobody cancelled plans March. April - May people got serious tourism heavily affected that.

Also, people coming Easter Island March large numbers already pandemic warnings?

Nothing explained satisfactory level detail. ""people stuck, feel bad them."" I'll feel bad idea getting into. aware risks ignored anti-intellectualism, got coming. Probably accurate answer conspiracy theory. Go follow MSM. 24/7 thing yourself, downvoting anything ""covid worst thing ever"" agree, tested. I'm certainly *rich* I'm poor luxury working home.

Let people need tests get them. People provide products service need sustain life, carry daily activities keep level safety. Grocery store workers, truck drivers, warehouse workers, delivery drivers, pharmacy staff, police, EMT, fire fighters. nothing working home. Lol.... they'll still vote him. guess get asked for. wearing masks hurt economy? went look photo, context everything (like beer joke quotation used caption it), almost believe one ""blunders"" like 'oh Black man Klansman buddy comedy' kind riff. saying that's racist, saying excusable, see like colossally stupid lack awareness. vein ""I dont see color! (so can't racist)""

And need neoliberal ""postracial"" colorblind approach policy. Instead need meet inequality is, recognize America economic social inequalities exist roughly along racial lines. That's way usher real change, instead trying skip ahead ""postracial"". Actually point current school design created crank factory workers, still working alright, could certainly use update. past, changes considered money pay current system, let alone change it. Considering situation find in, plus technology available, would make sense start thinking school be, taking Covid-19 modern economy consideration. see right continued attempt pretend nothing changed. didn't. dip April never went half value. instead doubled twice value July. We're still first wave. People hard time understanding big United States many people are. plenty places relatively untouched affected. We've probably 20-40 million cases. still hundreds millions people US infected could potential hosts. could drag pace years get vaccine. 

Just thought experiment....let's assume 7,000,000 cases really means 10x many cases happened. 70,000,000 people let's assume need get 80% herd immunity (might lower, actually know...it's assumption). 10x assumption could 50,000 reported cases day (500,000 real cases) 388 days got heard immunity. That's Halloween 2021. Worked company months ago promised raise wages meet ppp needs, thank employees working hazardous conditions.. found could keep money, pay employees different ""returned"" wages original unlivable rate.. Yes do.

No don‚Äôt, doesn‚Äôt exist. said vary state, mean governor decide?

A state-by-state response pretty much way things, since calling pandemic National emergency would panic stock market lead massive economic losses. US deaths cases entire world. agree there‚Äôs lot fog left Covid-19 crystal ball, accept several likelihoods: least one effective vaccine‚Äîhopefully several‚Äîwill approved U.S. early next year. Producing distributing vaccine take months, average American receiving dose (or doses) least mid- late 2021. widespread inoculation play large role bringing life back normal, getting shot cue take mask run free crowded bar. end pandemic evolution, revolution, vaccine another powerful tool process. understand government, they're saying current system flaws think changes needed. astute, balanced, take. Also keeps people becoming myopic sheltered high prestige job occasionally go menial duty.

As software developer, people worked shit-tier jobs bane existence. Myopic exactly term I'd use. Assume sake argument correct - point Biden wins believe see lot people moving hot button issue accepting it. Freedom vs Security Texas child enrolled school begin with. you‚Äôre homeschooling start, don‚Äôt contact school whatsoever.  remember back March/April people coughing, spitting sneezing people? Remember people licking stuff grocery store, door handles, etc? Remember delivery guy spitting packages dropped people's houses? Remember guy giving CoVid hugs?

I know really *can* trust people sneeze cough candy. Halloween always courage facing fears. always trusting neighbors. year I'd rather err side caution safety. dude, cracked case. Yes takes 76 days discipline eliminate covid. governments wanted gone would gone now, like China. seems like used political/control purposes. Also pharmaceutical companies make many billions vaccines, tests treatments. eradication/elimination option even presented public? least from, governor tightened restrictions recently. threatens tighten more. Luckily live border town, actually things relatively easily. Residents center state ignore edicts hope get citations/shut down.

There post recently many upvotes comments titled ""Sorry small gatherings safe."" seems mindset around here. Catholic Church lot institutional problems, Francis made headway certainly hasn‚Äôt remedied them, (and definitely made missteps) however, appreciate dedication reminding people primary message God, love respect one another.  Stockholm highest immunity, possible... know anyone gotten it... know quite people felt little funny though last 5 months weeks. feel fine now.

I know 50x amount people royally fucked shutdown.

Priorities people.  People nursing homes pinnacle health . study UC San Francisco average length stay someone nursing home death 13 months. 53 percent study died within six months admittance. admitted nursing home long term care multiple comorbidities, makes high risk. nursing homes, encourage residents get flu shots one outbreak flu nursing home wreak havoc. Sadly, death occurs frequently nursing homes. school still open! Tbf, beginning opposition government stood quite united borgfred, June got criticised one openly critical months. real world, every successful 1st world country capitalist... go work morning? take public transportation get there? tried follow social distancing bus 7:30 morning? Even wearing masks, that's dangerous, something pretty much everybody forced do. example.

Then bare minimum wear mask? Follow social distancing much possible waiting public transport? assume take public transport?

I care people much follow guidelines. Clearly there's difference essential travel breaching social distancing guidelines entertainment purposes (bars, parties everything between).

'France seeing uptick coronavirus infections hundreds new clusters recent weeks, notably young people gather caf√©s parties families meet summer mention factors difference ""I protest want wear mask"" ""I protest fired"" ""please let keep restaurant open, go bankrupt"".

Again false narrative. think restaurants stay open uncontained outbreak? one second think best case scenario restaurants stay open social distancing measures adapting focusing take hint: thinking problem involving people, first step always assume people rational agents, least rational you, reasons things, they're ""dumb selfish"".

Holding parties middle pandemic breaches social distancing guidelines dumb selfish.

Meeting groups big enough cause restaurant break social distancing thereby risk closure dumb selfish.

Not wearing masks crowded place like public transportation example dumb selfish.

Sorry, provide rational reason people this, argument comment. point wearing masks social distancing easy part restrictions.

Yet people willfully flout easy restrictions, what's parts, ones perhaps experiencing, hard ones.

Retail F&amp;B businesses reopened safely following mask mandates establishing social distancing dine guests. What's everybody afford luxury staying home see anybody

Again disingenuous argument. social distancing guidelines allow people meet groups least 10. Who's asking people stay home see privilege always situations 2 square meters personal space.

Beyond public transport, often even occur people outside family bubble? Even malls congestion tends escalators, even hard practice social distancing. certainly hard practice social distancing queues fucking try understanding other.

Let's also present dishonest arguments. true want save lives. However, capitalism never saving lives maximise profits. whose dreams purchased pennies dollar rich corporations. America fucked rich people, man. I'm truly confused coming numbers. They're projecting califronia absolutely explode next 3 months, understand why. California real winter, conditions supposed make pandemic worse really exist here. Somehow california going 30,000 deaths 3 months? Maybe want believe seems crazy. Self-declared mega-capitalists sucking public tit again. saying anecdotal experience disproves consensus science. Cool man.

And yes, second wave happen people follow guidelines. yes, whole point postpone get vaccine - DUH. much tbh unless you‚Äôre severely affected states like MH. currently India going gym (no one wears mask working out) hanging friends month, still haven‚Äôt infected. end.... Hard say. People wear masks everywhere go, that's intentional. would assume small businesses bars nothing mask usage, never have. Butttt... I've self selected safer rotation places go. case anyone wondering that‚Äôs worse euro countries US Q2 know know anyone itching take Trump vaccine. Hoax people think need Serious people trust it.

No dispute least seeing family, friends things like hobbies totally sacrificied ""greater good"".

Totally, need totally isolate yourself. Go see family, stay outside, wear masks, limit length visit. Go hobbies, long done felt way extrapolate many extroverts probably totally lost cannot function quarentine mode.

No need extrapolate--the empirical evidence unfortunately around reason think half assed corona response encourage busisnesses open, schools open, still expect people lockdown mode life.

I think ""lockdown mode"" expected, flying weddings (or big gatherings) going bars gyms. risky right personally plan wear mask anytime im indoor space pick choose outtings based passionate feel (so probably movie theatres, open meeting close friends families occasional gym outtings biggest passion pre lockdown open)

Better *avoid* indoor spaces whenever possible. go inside, wear fitted N95 (or surgical mask available) limit duration excursion. Absolutely go gym: poorly ventilated indoor space bunch people exercising breathing hard dream come true virus. then, exercise outside and/or buy basic exercise coronavirus situation convinced rellying individuals act accordingly blaming work simply work. unsafe - rules place lock down. end day people inherently selfish unfortunately.

Absolutely agree here. government many places bears blame closing high-risk settings like indoor dining, bars, terrified virus like everyone else truly feel get it, statistically probably work interaction anyway even PPE.

That might might case, argument taking risk areas life. number cases compared number deaths make sense? feel like correlate months ago. suggests either ICUs managing save lives death statistics significantly suppressed. ‚òπÔ∏è

My opinion would data wrong, friend cares Covid patients confirmed he‚Äôs seeing fewer new cases. Honestly, let's assume everything Covid now. mean can't single symptom without covid related... problem?

No, real problem people hyped vaccines magic cure already said stop wearing masks distancing eyes pandemic exist past getting vaccine.

Whenever pointed people bet downed told nonsense like ""I've suffered enough, I'm vaccinated care anymore"".

If anything, vaccine *might*even make things worse little everyone stops taking precautions. actually stay locked in, option wear mask necessary.

It inherently better young college kids get infected...how many interact vulnerable? infected quasi-contained bubbles college means unlikely spread infected.

I small business can't even get money PPP taken first days huge corporations teams lawyers applied right away.

Now funds available small guys, like since April.  You‚Äôre insane person. Reddit singles America chance get. Im saying thats untrue. tell least area lot jobs available. Even work hiring people dozen. live wealthy town state means. Everywhere go see sign saying hiring people hear tough find people right now. may true live though, hope OK things improve. First off,

Saying cases increasing deaths staying flat ridiculous statement. past 9 months we've watched increased deaths COVID lag behind positive case increased 4-6 weeks. that's long takes someone die virus.

Secondly,

You correct low population density restricted travel mobility delayed Dakotas massive uptick now. mean since last get it, cavalier handle it. furthermore, clear virus isnt effected seasonality, cases exploded US early spring late summer. Hot not, still get it.

Thirdly,

Regardless many cases town, city, state has, requiring infected come contact infected quarantine common sense. state repeals quarantine order, basically giving people close contact covid continue going spreading others. yes, ""Nobody taking seriously"" applied here.

And Finally,

You seem upset getting downvoted, came sub clearly taking COVID seriously, (NOT HYSTERICALLY), make post need taken seriously. Know audience man. ""I shocked news"" -nobody Restrictions mean people cannot work, children supposed school aren't, quarantine 14 days want see family.

The restrictions would prevent people working going school easily avoided people wear mask follow social distancing guidelines. 

People would far less need quarantine community spread contained too. Want wager guess helps achieve that?

See New Zealand, Finland, Norway, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan Hong Kong good act high mighty wear piece cloth front mouth nose, know restrictions been, way heavier mandatory masks, hard many people.

Social distancing arguably important, yet people can't seem either. What's next excuse going hard many people.

What's 'very hard' wearing mask social distancing help country stay safely reopened **everyone** go work, school avoid quarantines? one enjoys things, they're, worst, bearable inconvenience (and many others) choose put country stay re-opened. Like said, stop selfish. Even challenges teaching remotely, found great balance teach students, try offer time day social time talk interests like video games, pet show tell, drawing sharing, etc. difficult, school got waiver reopen early even though literally purple (high rate transmission community.) charter school CA East bay area. 

I rolling punches now. asthma inflammatory disease, I'm incredibly concerned contracting virus long term effects would already great system. 

I'm dilemna... quit healthcare pay, try roll play russian roulette. I'm single person income. :(

I've crying every day log teaching. I'm stressed burnt out. absolutely love students teaching almost 10 years, dont feel safe. I'm tired. fair I‚Äôm super small company got super small PPP money, thing. However I‚Äôm rid toxic partner.

I may dilute shares though. need feel superior. want flaunt it‚Äôs worked must harder smarter worker. actuality usually comes know opportunities come way. 20 year old grocery store worker got surface refinishing company would come buff store night, tripling pay job learned 3 weeks. decent worker? Sure. ‚Äúdeserve‚Äù 50k year glorified janitor? Fuck that‚Äôs life, need pompous Giesecke obviously one them, smack modeller's theocratic crisis management well? limit public announcements?
All political parties since followed letting experts decisions? people still trust them? Sounds like point hayfork anyone meet. Antibiotics could definitly help. virus ofc lungs damaged likley get infected microbes like bacteria. Let's stand top rung ladder see happens. Yeah mean nice little word ‚Äúmay‚Äù last sentence tells everything need know. last thing federal government going hold buddies accountable fraud knew going commit authorized funds I've done 99% shopping online since March. great. one downside able support local indipendants time. Isn‚Äôt first shoot dogs space? ‚ÄúNo vaccine, space you!!‚Äù üê∂ well currently death rate 3% infected USA like said. currently 40k 300 million getting infected daily USA...lets make times 5 conservative 200k 300 million getting infected daily...so that's .06 % chance get infected. get infected die 3% times .06% equals .002 %..so wait off, favor argument. brunt article well intentioned, specific projection IHME likely overblown. I‚Äôd surprised half per day 2021. Could even lower still unless see major reversal (and soon).

Unfortunately, they‚Äòve done throughout pandemic, IHME gradually reduce forecasts bit bit move towards end year, attempting underplay inaccurate models (both various stages). they‚Äôll dismiss massive gap result ‚Äúgood behaviour‚Äù.

I understand preaching caution preparing, mathematical model ought somewhat realistic reflection reality. Fortunately, many tried true models available would actually like accurate idea things going (spoilers: still great).

Feel free set reminders. spreading truth Tegnell's puppets downvote make truth go away. confirm ‚Äúproblem‚Äù students almost 99 percent kids ‚Äúcomputer‚Äù issues digital learning. 

Kinda funny kids normally do
all assignments don‚Äôt seem issues logging virtual school figuring assignments. lockdown defined group sizes freedom movement far know... need laws something. still fucking understand fuck give money directly workers. Oh yeah! That's communism! give billionaire communism, right? sicker. financial inequality what's killing me.

I work full time bring home $500/week tax. March August hours cut bringing home $400/week qualify unemployment. NY work four days can't claim unemployment, despite representing 20% cut income full time work.

My part time coworkers would normally work two days per week bring home $150 tax (union dictates pay - pay rate) making $780/week early months COVID. Right they're bringing home $480/week unemployment Trump's $300/week executive order compared $500/week working full time. 

I'm supposed risk life work daily, I'm getting absolutely nothing unemployed/furloughed sitting home handed far money deserve. truly shame organized labor movement ready golden opportunity covid first hit. Nobody would even actually stop working, hint threat going general strike would gotten every last delivery driver/healthcare worker/grocery store etc employees least permanent raise paid vacation days. I'm glad got temporary raises least nearly enough IMO. Great article sub certainly changed tune last 3 months. July news would welcomed open arms...now.......not much It‚Äôs basically slavery. rich profit us getting poorer sicker. Exactly America supposed work lol Former military recruiter here. shit almost 3 years. awful want job first place, ever look telephone way again. want talk me, please send text e-mail instant message, thanks. don‚Äôt think cancelled 1957, 1968 (both 1-3x deadly covid per capita), 2009. No. never admitted COVID patients. forgiven x percent used payroll. Originally something like 75% months later, changed much lower percentage. Obviously seems like plan along. maybe US needs take look jails look. Many countries dont issue.

Cruelty prisoners doesnt actually solve anything either. Also remember everyone prison murderer pedophile. take mean double checking testing sewage? least one univeristy state make sure... one left enforce them.  US officially banana republic. PPP? 

Yea know me! Yes. Thing still people bickering ""official"" numbers. telling pneumonia deaths. We've seriously retarded normal flu cold patterns whole year numbers roof.

Honestly know full impact virus years analysts properly look data. open question. surveys get less 9 10 fail reprimanded. Even it‚Äôs it‚Äôs customer didn‚Äôt know completely fault. üò°  It‚Äôs called confident yourself. need get mad know yourself. Yes, simple. I'm sure companies repay without issue. given loan 1% interest rate. lot companies essentially 24 month interest free loan. 
Which seems fair, right? know average american totally access large short term loans almost interest. /s/ Walmart kills local business would net economic social good close stores. old [communicable diseases law actually allowed larger lockdowns section removed 1988 overhauled. 30 kingdom war danger war otherwise called extraordinary circumstances, government or, kingdom war, authority determined government may order closure certain area prevent spread contagious disease.

But basically needed war it. Lock. Them. All. Up.

This beyond infuriating people like struggling survive pandemic.  likely evicted soon find way pay rent month next month.  savings cashed 401k pay rent last month given Trump's asinine payroll tax holiday doubly fucked 20 years reach retirement age.  Fuck people. kidding me, pathetic, try working friggin ISP trying keep network capacity, outages, dumbass customers, people simply give shit appreciate do, see appreciation people working retail restaurants, nobody gives shit people keep internet running, goes linemen/electricians well Quick answer this: exceptions 1st amendment. example, curfews put temporarily place people safety reasons. know side line fall on, government likely argue ""temporary public safety measure"" targeted outbreak's current demographic.

Note: mean agree it, putting likely argument government put forward. Exploitation workers like separate bills procedure (one anesthesia, one hospital room, etc) without consideration developmental social mental health needs child.

Its weird thousands home schooled children fine, mention grew remote areas, well rural farms neighbors.

Its like...over stressing ""social needs development"" completely thing, used people need excuse push in-person pandemic schools"
