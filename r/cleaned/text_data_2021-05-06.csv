**Bathing frequency associated skin barrier dysfunction atopic dermatitis three months can‚Äôt defined simple metric. others pointing here, account seasonality use non-use masks, social distancing, etc., consider things period time, single moment.

Especially schools. vaccines approved children schools start without precautions know could consider ""herd immunity"" since ton unvaccinated people close quarters. think really consider society ""herd immunity"" we've able vaccinate significant percentage school children (likely 50%). Otherwise order keep rate infection would need prolong distance learning. think China respects patents anyways? Without technology transfer training supervision factory right equipment raw materials. Yes it‚Äôs completely moot. 


Drug makers already stretched thin is. wonder reaction hold power. 
I think forget forgotten were, it‚Äôll hard convince respect elderly etc. approved fda yet, it‚Äôs emergency stage. Hey you‚Äôre looking better steak arcade setting, you‚Äôre gonna find it. current ""best estimate"" Infection Fatality Ratios:

0-17: 0.002%

50-64: 0.6%

65+: 9%

""Survival rates"" 99.998%, 99.95%, 99.4%, 91% respectively.

This ""best estimate."" really meant definitive IFR, used making projections. lower/higher IFR numbers use get range projections. 

The meme tried obfuscate context numbers, also straight got wrong. surprisingly.

Not mention people get serious cases covid (weeks/months hospitalized, ICU, etc) survive reflected numbers. I'd classify life threatening course COVID-19 ""getting fucked"" even get hospital alive. Looks like numbers heading right direction we're probably going great summer thanks vaccines. know promising drops cases/infections different drop saw last year spring heading summer? We're trajectory last year know happened summer ended. I've people point last year's promising numbers spring/summer I'm sure answer different. know, hear work place too. insanity obsession ‚Äúreviews‚Äù endless comparisons people addicted online spilled electronics consumer goods general. addiction personal connection people attach purchasing decisions toxic, last thing need applying getting vaxxed. Israel combined vaccine rollout strict lockdown going go route estimated deaths, also infections like influenza, nowhere near microscope coronavirus. Nothing *eliminate* risk 100%, get dramatic *reduction* risk. seen specific research organ damage breakthrough infections, CDC report around six hundred hospitalizations around hundred deaths Covid post vaccination. Mind you, 95 *million* vaccinated people, obviously tiny fraction, would expect least severe cases degree lung damage. studies lung recovery post regular Covid infections, see  looks like may something overwhelmed healthcare system moment possibly able keep sanitary requirements. article refers one specific hospital, covid population whole.

According every hospital USA required publicize details infectious outbreaks occur within facilities. 2014, details lethal mucormycosis outbreak occurred 2008 emerged television newspaper reports responded article pediatric medical journal. Contaminated hospital linen found spreading infection. 2018 study found many freshly laundered hospital linens delivered U.S. transplant hospitals contaminated Mucorales.""

So something get covid immunocompromised. also put environment get infected. knowing protecting others incentive? Idk, killing parents seems like pretty good effing reason get inoculated. know, return favor. Seeing never got polio tetanus measels mumps variety diseases thanks mother kind enough vaccinated child, LEAST get inoculated protection. well, pride wiped amount death negative press receiving.

Same wanting crash economy lockdown... rate, economy going crash itself. go work sick can't afford take day off? thought talking German, sorry that.

But regard agree, US seem work great terms deaths reason. Netherlands, high amount cases around 160,000 cases per day US) high positivity rate high amount currently infectious people 100 people currently infected). average around 350 deaths per day US lest 7 days, even reporting 60 deaths (if US) days ago. basically excess mortality last months.

This means level infections highest ever been, daily cases similar early January/Winter peak late October/Autumn peak, deaths never lower since early October/September. means current CFR around 0.2% (overall CFR 1.2%).

For reason infections US low, deaths staying relatively high. Especially compared Netherlands, relatively high cases low deaths compared US (this case before, quite similar). makes difference even extreme, Netherlands 1 2 months behind US terms vaccinations (they reach 85% adult population least partially vaccinated ‚Öî fully vaccinated start July). 34% least partially vaccinated 9% fully vaccinated currently (of adult population). means US see greater vaccination effect longer compared Netherlands terms cases deaths, now, could seen terms infections, deaths (again, compared Netherlands). reading correctly? Americans getting paid get vaccine? 

Dystopian country say this.   virus percolate get worse population then. Yes people frustratingly badly behaved. It‚Äôs still worth taxpayer money get vaccinated. question one fairness tribe, it‚Äôs one public health. I've waiting couple weeks call I've registered vaccine, prioritise walk-in vaccination? Maybe sould've went route. Someone one group chats said went 3 different vaccine locations looking specifically Pfizer Moderna J&amp;J, instead getting vaccinated all, bitched able get Pfizer left.

I wanted say something, found insanely stupid downright neurotic, especially scientists researchers said get whatever vaccine offered you, whatever. quite like idea. I‚Äôm sorry fucking stupid mean honestly, virus behaves, temperature checks essentially pointless begin with. done give sense security, that‚Äôs all. Kind surprised! thought solid bit! It‚Äôs.... cheaper get vaccine. I've heard people turning 350 get shot. stopped wearing mine things like going small shops gas station ago. I'm waiting CDC give enough leadway becomes socially acceptable forgoe completely. believe european entity tests sputnik V, may hella wrong though.

I'd love research made public researches could test efficacy side effects. deffinitely better nothing. Temperature checks really help anything, hopefully Disney require vaccine passports soon. 

I'm fully vaccinated ready get life, deluded, antivax cult members like it, stay home. That's state level thing, right?

I totally agree, 9/11-style Truth Commission investigate catastrophic cause failure Trump CDC. excess deaths stood 14k official covid death count 3500 (end 2020). trust official data government likes brag about. way Serbia better healthcare covid Japan. I'm getting there.

lets say Rt high, like 1.5.. better vaccinate vulnerable first must vaccinate lot people reach herd immunity.. better vaccinate vulnerable first save people way..

True. since anti-body test test available, flawed is, thought I'd get protected.

I'm concerned variants mutants whatever.

My anti-bodies levels elevated seen photo, I've slowly (under guidance doctor) increased levels Vitamin D, (150 nmol/L, currently; little bit higher doctor asked get (125 nmol/L)). also gave small Zinc supplement (7.5 mg) take daily, wear mask everywhere.

Better super-safe super-sorry! US ~~fast~~ food industry. common. Norway law able take period three consecutive days sick leave, four times year (meaning 4x3 days). companies relaxed rules, everyone government allowed stay home eight consecutive work days, total 24 days per year.

If children another additional, similar quota accommodate staying home due sickness.

It's abused much. people home twice year due cold similar.   vaccinations going? yet, still chance 

/s This.. Thanks lot pointing too. article headline biased.
Thr definition 'severe' also clear. person still need oxygen supply? severe include use ventilator? Vague. never seen country paid sick leave system require doctors note (in extreme cases, max three days work). get from?

In Netherlands concept doctor's note exist. all. sent special doctor specialized conditions affect ability work massive shortage 'm moment. I've sick months I've never even talked there's use case.

Brilliant way Ffs- also introduce Russian vaccine proven 92% effective speed distribution?? one three 90% efficacy. believe also [a single dose 80% efficacy. is, Pfizer, Moderna, AZ etc say need third jab within years time so, could speed things up. figured much.

I wish would come data tells us level antibodies good enough protection.

This specific test done 4 days second shot, 10 weeks first. repeat 2 weeks see whether residual anti-bodies first shot (significant increase levels) new ones provided second one (almost level). 2,100 cases Wednesday, 66 million people.

Illinois 2,400 12 million. Elderly vulnerable, too, like anybody else vaccinated, need step back demands lifting restrictions and/or self-impose everybody else gets chance vaccine access received.

Curevac invented mRNA vaccines. regrets getting Johnson &amp; Johnson instead Moderna Pfizer. keep reading ""66% effective"" may reactionary layman's understanding means, still sound good ""95% effective."" think people like ever get chance do-over/supplemental shot? say clots, all, appear within 20 days shot after. Yup! Anything 50 test positive.  Correction: Serbian tax payers getting shafted president self promote. fully effective it

They 100% effective variant, never were. saw thing Israel. people get vaccinated, unvaccinated change behavior increase cases. Look numbers week.

You get there. Take deep breath.  Ifthey knowits covid got already tested, got tested government knows. know hopefully quarantine. every first world country get sick leave?  purchases handled EU level countries union, rich ones, would access vaccines.  interesting. first time I've heard _viral injury_.

There many controversies, many secrets government hiding, mention selling arabs buy back land much higher prices thus damaging economy further.

Also, justify government giving 10-40% raises paychecks? global pandemic? exactly? handled covid shit like absolute ass, constantly going back forth idiotic decisions. vaccine part great; everything else much.

There's reason believe variants deadly original strain, research points major vaccines effective preventing serious illness death variant strains well.

Vaccines effective environment vaccinated individuals. would also encourage higher uptake. feel like punishing people unvaccinated wrong way go. Bavaria also changing laws lockdown rules apply fully vaccinated people, would fair, everyone equal chance get vaccinated.

Now, punishing suffer lockdown, least likely severe case corona, went lockdown protect elderly. Thanks fucking nothing. I'm sick politics old people old people Keep little people table fighting scraps. true. disagree, think small minority take AZ offered alternative. 40s much hesitant is. Summer travel probably wont come it, covid passports include testing negative, 12 week wait second dose puts us August already summer gone anyway.  unpopular thing say reddit. can't talk China's coal problem America supposedly worst offender china loves clean energy something.

Then they'll argue china deserves time they're developing country. ass. I'd like bring kids Disney, can't get vaccinated yet. vaccinated adults around would make feel better taking them. 35% vaccinated mean 65% antivaxx.. anti-vaccine group US seems republican men. poor beats conservativism rather quickly, I'm exactly convinced giving $100 people would change things much here. Never thought I‚Äôd like something Serbia did... Soviet Russia, official trolls **YOU!** anyone really worried confirm thought Bill Gates asshole got shot still think he‚Äôs asshole after. also use Mac computers Sony/Nintendo gaming consoles, there‚Äôs chip I‚Äôm guessing mine busted. Check local WalMarts announced they're walk-ins nationwide. Last part true. get covid get 100% sick leave vaccinated, bot get around 70% cases. aleays get something, min 60%. Nobody come plausible explanation vaccines halt spread numerous studies, CDC Israel, show huge declines spread vaccinated areas. whatever reason officials can't say this.

I guess people keep restrictions even vaccinations pretty absurd. Possibly still option

In UK designated places per town they're giving vaccine call towards end day see free

One vaccines needs defrosted can't refrozen literally get binned otherwise Variants.... cannot mitigate way forever. Everyone either get get vaccine 100% 80 hour limit like previous FFCRA bill did. bills 500 less employee limit. Cool! Thank reassuring perspective!  Gotta say ups downs.

Wait, Americans sick leave? seems illegal generalisation. Also motive protests kids got first shots 4/12 4/14. time hard find appointment, pharmacy web sites every day finally found something school day across town.

Today, shots available 10 places near day every day. Reportedly WalMart started walk-ins local mall started same. 2nd shots due 5/12 5/14 think easy go someplace right near by. Pfizer. reasons attributed wrong. Yup. AstraZeneca still great vaccine, even better alternatives available infections low may worth low-risk groups wait vaccines. That‚Äôd annoying. week ahead schedule would really catch lot folks going happen. Unfortunately world going wait point worried slightest. Can't wait. Ok we‚Äôre getting bit weird here. Anyone bring vaccine card someplace - what‚Äôd do? put phone show needed? photo copy need physical card if/when need prove I‚Äôm vaccinated? 

Traveling work weekend afraid losing it. Update, 8 hours later: sleep great due arm pain, bad. fever side effects. two vaccines tested differently. J&amp;J one-shot vaccine testing trials one shot. Pfizer Moderna two-shot vaccines tests done around that.

There data effective Pfizer/Moderna vaccines one shot data short duration like ~4 weeks everyone studies got 2nd shots (not everyone world, everyone studies). words, nobody really knows long term efficacy vaccines one shot, studied.

You look closely efficacy numbers. include short long term, mild severe illness. Sometimes take numbers together average them. pretty annoying people care long term. 66% thrown around J&amp;J mild illness (and remember statistical sample study).

Or math 82% *ELIGIBLE* people? case, comparing apples comparable total amount given, UK given first doses even though open 40s, whereas they've stalled US.

So 7% comparison to? expanded everyone. 

That's said happen. Eligibility keep expanding age group reaches youngest. opened people aged 56 day another year group reaches 50, they'll focus getting vast majority vaccinated they'll move next cohort.

Where's primary source many people vaccinated per vaccine age range? can't seem find although I'm sure I've seen somewhere. Thanks advance know is! third Montana residents vaccinated

Whose fault that? Vaccines freely available. get it. would religion permit mask wearing? Australia currently running elimination strategy covid. We've even barred citizens returning currently India.

Vaccines preventing infection makes vaccinated international arrivals risk. hoped 'vaccine passport' type system could allow us open borders allow free movement vaccinated people.

If vaccine prevent spread non-vaccinated people, borders remain closed current strategy population vaccinated. 

Neither article, news organization anti-vax. public universities Michigan mandated Fall live campus-so far. Full FDA approval probably mandate classes also. moderna, safe say thing? elderly. disagree. First conversation countries universal paid sick leave, US one would irrelevant.

I'm saying people get that's available. many friends family Hungary however purchased Sinovac, Sputnik V, AZ, Pfizer definitely advised presented choice, Sinovac.

With UAE I'm mainly talking case rates deaths. know early death rate low (well really bad spike til recently) probably vaccine reducing that, really think cases dropped much lower vaccine much effective preventing infection fast preventing infection others. slow slow - another hit it.

Still, quite good, spot 3 terms COVID-19 vaccine export spot 4 vaccine production. guess lawyers hash out. May moot anyway since Germany raising big stink. 

Frankly opinion, government required IP waiver condition contract... condition using government funded research. absence up-front agreement, ""pay"" IP rights... perhaps via 5 year corporate tax waiver something. That's true vaccines live attenuated viruses, like measles flu vaccines. IC people get infected them. However none authorized covid vaccines contain alive viruses. daughter's hands look awful. started using ""gloves bottle"" helped wonders cracked bleeding skin. hand sanitizer school really harsh.

Someone refuses get vaccinated gets sick gets someone else sick person dies, try murder manslaughter, get people sick punish making pay damage actually cause. punish someone protecting punish damage actually cause, theoretical damage. guys getting paid? wore messed head working around Covid denying plague rats entire time, plain simple. done yet, getting vaccinated, seem skipping masks. Small towns dreadful. obvious first problem hardware: need specific sorts cell culture tanks adenovirus vaccines, right kind filtration apparatus mRNA adenovirus ones. also need specialized mixing equipment formation mRNA lipid nanoparticles. good proportion world‚Äôs supply hardware already producing vaccines, best knowledge. Second, need key consumable equipment go along hardware. Cell culture bags limiting step Novavax subunit vaccine, actual filtration membranes needed others. short supply patents, waiving vaccine patents make appear. Third, need key reagents. Among others, there‚Äôs ‚Äúend-capping‚Äù enzyme supply constraint, lipids needed mRNA nanoparticles, two vaccines. lipids indeed proprietary, synthesis also subject physical constraints nothing patent rights, availability ultimate starting materials.

This one big fucking practical joke I'm really tired dealing with. screaming EU conspiracy undermine vaccine, screaming MHRA would found blood clots millions doses already given Britons, downplaying acknowledgement MHRA indeed blood clot issue, downplaying decision MHRA advise 30s take another vaccine, Brits going now?

Months propaganda British media, months comments rabid British nationalists Reddit downplay attack news blood clots issue, end UK restrictions AZ vaccine fucking Germany. 

Utterly pathetic hilarious, that's comedy material years. probably thinks minimum drinking age customers. Whelp, they're wrong. 

Helt Flordia must like 'completely wtf' then. stop using VaRiAnTs excuse reopen now?

The vaccines work. Everybody wants one get one. time go back normal. isn't. Masks political issue, they're public health issue. someone intentionally coughing face knowingly spreading STDs would call *them* out, too.

If nation's top doctors health officials saying ""wear mask"" Republicans overwhelmingly likely refuse (which true), Republicans ones making masks political issue. think curve slowing due lack testing kits?  way get accurate data right now? That's great, [economists worried](http://www.fiskalnisavet.rs) economy gave persom 100 euros, even government announced this.

60% 7/07 taking doses, long vaccine effective for? that'd 90%+ safe. case people get pissed government set high bar. vaccination eliminate possibility organ damage somehow get infected COVID again? 30s people still offered second dose. There's lot data second doses mixing matching vaccines.

I would expect get offered second dose. i'll pissed. taste smell faintly, wonder aggravated sinuses actually covid. sinuses dead clogged day. Temperature checks don‚Äôt much part anyway. family got Covid unfortunate back January none got fever once. Dangggg Nah Anti-vaxx global. It‚Äôs even higher many European countries US Reentry stress common.

If clubs freak out, try smaller steps start with. checked vacation cabin last summer. lady charge never checked wife though. useless guess thought something positive. verifying vaccinations though. got mine already. get third 100? Well count lucky. wish could get vacinated Europe, might take 6 months least people 25. shitty thing wel also can't go vacation, elderly people can.   husband got fever aches tiredness day nausea three days second shot. Take poor person‚Äôs gold ü•á thought clear second shot took morning felt fine day little sore arm, soon slept, flu-like symptoms came destroy me. good portion today I‚Äôve slave TV recovering Tylenol fighting chills fever. right feel clear feel 100% tomorrow. grind was, though. Reminded times caught flu made scared again. looking forward future booster shots is. say thing infected strong symptoms vs infected without? Indian vaccines legitimate lol. They‚Äôre biggest producers vaccines world. vaccines already gone 40 countries around world long, long run, benefit patent laws upheld predictable/stable. 5 arm, please. Read comment, again. *do* want people vaccinated, I'm going waste energy worrying whether people do. control.

What *can* wear mask necessary, I'm going boycott businesses require masks. That's stupid.

I care, enough worry things *can't* control 24/7. ""They know long term effects $100 yet"" Tbh never see anyone claiming America greatest country honestly quite opposite. fact it‚Äôs gone opposite direction point see people call worst racist say ‚Äúchill‚Äù. Even people say greatest least nowadays it‚Äôs endearment rather acting superior. People countries call country greatest. time see chauvinism Americans talk strongest military best universities strongest industries like defense tech finance research fairly legitimate claims varying degrees spank buns. way withheld. 

They made choice. chose risk it. 

If want sick leave better get jab already got shots collect $200 ? That‚Äôs $100 per shot???

Got vaccine card prove Sure. you‚Äôve created administrative work verify actually followed this, people already got without incentive get twice much.  hoax cannot shed vaccine Yeah, recall I've actually many occasions tried Indian firm uses American supplier could American firm patent sue supplier stop exporting?

Also diplomatic consequences ignoring patents like US accusing China of. Mm. Went day like 23. likely polyps involved. Still could result side effect suppose slept like 18 hours entire left side upper body hurt.. 3 days felt sick day fine.. get second shot end month Fucking *tyrant*. Pfizer side effect sore arm. wonder medication take (60mg Prozac) perhaps affected it? know Prozac anti-inflammatory properties. I'm hoping I'm adequately protected. Sounds like covid. Never heard cold causing loss taste makes people suspicious. didn't, many friends family chills low grade fever 48 hours following second shot. better tomorrow. Pfizer want sell vaccines directly Indian public. want bulk orders government. many doses reckon Indian government could bought price quoting.

 Moreover Pfizer doesn‚Äôt ability deliver doses number would make difference India. Look rate delivering nations like South Africa Brazil.  people without COVID history zero effects first vaccine. second shot likely cause side effects. know anyone effects first, friends family suffered second shot (but nothing major, still worth getting!). keep forgetting vulnerable people basically deaths. 

They not. CFR fallen factor 3 Colorado since we've begun vaccination. People catch COVID, hand, 100% deaths. Australia/NZ feel free wait Pfizer. I'm 1B volunteering, AstraZeneca appointment cancelled one day Astra recommendation came out. Pfizer next 4-6 weeks.

If live continent, get rough math need vaccinate 580k adults per day hit 70% first dose July 4.


Of course, decent amount daily first doses going forward minors. keep forgetting vulnerable people basically deaths. around 0.8% deaths 50, many vulnerable. group also much smaller entire 50 group mostly spreading around COVID-19. vaccinate vulnerable least vulnerable within vulnerable group. means first thousand vaccines group prevent much, much deaths last thousand vulnerable group. Vaccinating first 1000 18 year olds basically anything short term. 

One objectively better method, worse almost every aspect.  mention question crazy stuff they‚Äôve teaching throughout year. damage long done. would luck got COVID *again* get vaccine 1. already COVID January. 

Got first vaccine Monday. Tuesday rough, body aches fatigue etc. Gone Wednesday, developed thought cold. Stuffy/runny nose, mucousy, little cough, etc. Girlfriend sick too.

However, lost sense taste smell....even though tasted lunch even 5 hours ago. 

Could cold cause that? I'm really pissed. One close family members dances Broadway, that's want give shot! Nothing's impossible! 5 weeks, 5 days. may lol given news reports images broken healthcare system, likely underreported. Although Germany also better hospital beds/population ratio: 8 per 1,000 38 ICU per 100,000. India sits 0.53 hospital beds per 1000, ICU 2.3 per 100,000. technically ICU capacity Germany handle 16 times many cases per capita. point, India definitely 2.4 million deaths already happened. Another thing consider fact India's health care system state collapse, people can't get proper treatment non-Covid health problems. 

In worst case scenario, could see death toll passing 10 million. really sad... local news station Facebook filled people saying outright lies stuff vaccines general. 

I mean, get it. want get vaccine personally... fear mongering people legit worried law least TOS social platforms.   That's bad  Doesn‚Äôt get Covid, dies heart disease. Interesting. Got reading that? Yes, explanation wrong case places suppressing. vaccinating people likely spread stop cases (R&lt;1) prevent deaths, some.

You slowly prevent spread. Vaccination effect quickly. effect small vaccinate elderly, countered start vaccinating young people go party.  We'll get started statue stat. What's happening India tragic, put perspective: they've still experienced less half total deaths US has, despite 3-4x population.  


Fake numbers make deaths go away. 


At least 1 million people India already died, country one path cross 10 million deaths. cards photo ones day did? look super fake, like photocopied side separate paper, poorly cut put back back terrible laminate.

Shit make 200 u got deal Absolutely. protect you, it'll protect others. importantly, help world get back normal soon possible! 

Here's cool little article weighing risks benefits AZ vaccine: explained way around prevents deaths quickly (basically preventing people highest chance dying COVID dying within weeks instead months first slowing spread less vulnerable people getting infected eventually less vulnerable people dying). 

Now explain slowly preventing spread younger people prevent vulnerable dying quickly directly vaccinating vulnerable people. could also sent links models show this. Italy that. paid high price it. hope goes jail long enough vaccine cards thing anymore gets out. UK:

28 days paid holiday law (can include bank holidays though).

Standard sickness allowance usually month full pay month half pay, within 12 month period, rolling calendar (doesn't reset fiscal year, instance removed counter 12 months added). offer more, offer less.

Obviously higher roles tend skip half pay double triple time allowed full pay, plus increased holiday time cases 40 days.

Law dictates jobs must offer bare minimum ""statutory sick pay"" paid around ¬£95 week, count first 3 days sick calculation pay.

For reference, average UK rent around ¬£550-¬£600 month 3-bedroom house/apartment, including London South East prices significantly higher (¬£1,500 average).

So, people, month statutory sick pay (only really done jobs value employees, go company sick policy allowance full half) cover rent. make situation worse better. Withholding sick leave someone actually sick inappropriate u\\springtimeMoonlight pointed lead people getting sick well alienating people making less trusting government. Maybe missed news reports, rich country people died en masse outside hospitals? beg, plead, pay 19-year-old son's truck payment month ($250) agree get vaccinated. 1000% worth it. Lol saw news stories walk-ins, thought might able save time.

But 30 years might high estimate. think lot people long covid recovering time, even get vaccinated.     Sounds like need put reverse parental controls mom‚Äôs computer/phone. Best guess got Facebook group. It‚Äôs time talk ... really evidence that. PTO taxed... Fungal infections quite common hospitalizations. know learning Texas basically direct translation crazy Norwegian favorite thing 2020.

Gotten 3 times far. even ask card! money incentive work instead sitting around day politicizing vaccines trying get free handouts them. Article refers Scott Gottlieb, FDA 2017 - 2019. article described common occurrence amongst almost Western news media sources, pro-russia media.

I hard time trying understand hoe news worthy become acceptable part hoe news media works.

See Xinjiang Genocide. singular source, amplified news media citing other, credible evidence. amplification created many media reporting thr things makes people believe it, even without shred credible evidence.

This things work now. media vehicles propaganda state run information disinformation. NYC metro area like Cali soon? horrible idea many reasons do, half americans seem think marxist liberal indocination camp. need start cracking one buys sells cards. Exactly, people WoW. Kroger gave $100 get shots. get something similar I'm told ten percent got vaccine, believe stayed right there. :( Consequences making personal medical choice indeed draconian free society understand population USA 30 times Israel's?  vaccine also experiment, welcome aboard part trial. Congrats Canada!   car coming you? dad way. tells ‚Äúmedia‚Äù won‚Äôt report bad parts vaccine. Apparently heard Tucker 4,000 people died vaccine absurd. hate outlets allowed spew misinformation Yup! parents vaccinated well nurses dont want affected. also work hospital (im healthcare worker tho) main coworkers come frequent contact vaccinated since january, mainly wondering avoid eating lunch limit possible spread get tested? received moderna vaccine. Time change flair? :) Calculus work! derivative function decreasing. official study data happens \*long term\* get 1 dose pfizer/moderna \*long term\* data J&amp;J effective single dose. nature business recommendations based official data intuitively true. getting slower subreddit imagining things?

Pfizer vaccine 95% effective condoms 98% effective... yet hear time people getting pregnant even using condoms. learn? wonder rest Asia hates Brilliant strategy. worry mean worry health issues, highly unlikely cause severe issues fully vaccinated. 


If mean whether asymptomatic pass others, complicated questions. chances low zero, also vary based vaccine got. high risk gotten vaccine. There's nothing draconian said. remember back could get 3 bottles eagle rare $100 :(  could probably get smaller shot glasses, he'd get shots per bottle, kids could hold without using two hands.  Why?

(mostly can't call work last minute sure should)  use unique QR codes vaccine card able easily verify authenticity. already use QR code PCR results India prevent exactly this, highly doubt US can't think even better way. mongolia giving people around 17$ per people got 2nd shot. Thank posting this, John. think something talk about. 

First - think said taken context. discusses summer looking ""very good"", that's possible, surely, able get enough people vaccinated. say *when*, exactly.

Secondly, he's board Pfizer new testing company. One might infer lot gain taking aggressive approach.

Thirdly, position dictate CDC. longer charge FDA, even was, FDA make decisions. 

So have? think statement believes advocate vaccinations. That's good; mistake tactics board company thst makes vaccine. may also raise price stock...?

Edit: concerned approach ""winter outbreaks"", though current system capacity control them. shown inadequate. Nice use carrot stick  think biggest issue rolling vaccine government backs someone dies adverse effect vaccine they'll held accountable. 

I'm UK I've already heard people talk get blood clot Astrazenica one want financial compensation. I've also talked people caught covid got bad said nature trying lower population. like inalienable rights? Serbia might place you. Ditto Perfectly balanced, things way  No, taste/smell definitely never recovered 100% though. Maybe 75-85% makes sense.

After clear nose faintly smell stuff. think sinuses aggravated. sore throat, fever, fatigue, aches. 

My girlfriend also sick, got sick time fully vaccinated. 

I'd say I/we COVID, might wanna play lottery. think like recovering leg foot injury. hard trust put weight run, time begin trust again.

You mentally go back normal even takes time get there.  There‚Äôs information war health sector it‚Äôs lost.

All under-40s offered alternative AstraZeneca vaccine falling Covid-19 infection rates makes risk blood clots loom larger.

There new safety concerns Oxford vaccine Joint Committee Vaccination Immunisation (JCVI) issue ‚Äúprecautionary‚Äù advice today thirties offered jabs success pandemic reduces risk Covid-19.

Supplies Pfizer-BioNTech Moderna make bulk remaining first doses, AstraZeneca largely used complete second doses older people, sources say.

More younger people may persuaded get vaccinated fear side effects removed. Scientists believe maximising take-up worth risk delaying end vaccination weeks, government insists track offer adults jab end July.

Last month JCVI said under-30s offered alternatives AstraZeneca evidence may cause rare type blood clot, risk dying one million. committee extend offer different vaccine 4.5 million people aged 30-39. hoped start month, AstraZeneca jab still offer alternative long wait.

For people 30 risk Covid-19 still higher risk clots, gap narrowing infection rates fall. Yesterday 2,613 cases reported, 10 per cent week.

The Department Health said medicines regulator, MHRA JCVI considered benefits AstraZeneca vaccine ‚Äúoutweigh risks vast majority adults‚Äù. half wonder happen US ... help achieve herd immunity, start offering financial incentives get vaccinated. financial penalties related vaccinated.

4. [Pfizer‚Äôs Covid Vaccine Doesn‚Äôt Need Ultra-Cold Storage, FDA last 2 weeks normal fridges. smart allocation doses, use Pfizer India, even must admit, outside capabilities BJP government. actually requires competency, Modi government lacks.

And approve Sputnik, refrigeration actual reason? True, criticizing Ghandi I've also seen covid webinar seemed reasonable, one people communicating public way could understand. I've mixed reactions. Twitter weird people tend pile on. feel way, absolutely infuriating. insurance companies refuse cover unvaccinated people well.

Is anything preventing HMOs this? Genuine question. let work ill. covid diagnosis show symptoms go home. Yeah UK vaccination rate US deaths 10 times lower per capita  would add make vaccine nation vaccinated flair too.

I got Moderna US. r/confidentlyincorrect can‚Äôt nice things. Smart Don‚Äôt care, want many people vaccinated possible.

but future situations also exist precedent? pay everyone quit smoking

Honestly, think work unless paid insane amount money. Even then, still might work. Nicotine withdraws incredibly bad persistent, yet removed nearly instantly smoking drags cigarette. 

That kind reward system easy overcome. downvote pointing out. (As comment history readily attest.) yeah, get that. point even responding find interesting world media highlighting terrible time Canada COVID compared US last weeks, actually quite relative drawing comparisons. Obviously states better last fall winter. despite weeks ahead us vaccinations, many places really far ahead us dealing virus yet. Canada state would talking dropping restrictions mask mandates.

Wal-Mart soaking carts giant pump sprayer months there. Germany restarting AZ vaccine too. Well done. Sometimes caution kill saves. mother-in-law can't get vaccine due current cancer treatments. Cancer prevalent older populations. 17% unable get it. 

No excuse can, take vaccine. true all. Australia it.

I‚Äôm vaccinated personally respect decision get vaccinated. what‚Äôs super unmotivating employers say ‚Äúlet‚Äôs get vaccinated go back office!‚Äù know one person putting that. still worth giving AZ vaccines UK though.

It that's I'm talking about. company gives one extra pay time vaccinated employee. isn‚Äôt enough incentive. canceled everything day second dose (appointments, activities) waited feel sick. Nothing. arm actually hurt first shot! Hell yeah fuck privacy! told deaths per capita Minnesota higher Ontario's felt little twinge vaccine administered (first Moderna shot), otherwise unaffected it. 
My girlfriend took vaccine six minutes me,and like got hit dump truck. commission couple days...
Could number things explain unfazed. Could I'm built like bear takes lot make sick. could common sense stuff like staying left arm (where got shot) couple days. could also blood work last year using injections preparation vaccine. Could number things. Follow money trail... There's reason ""PM Covid Fund"" explicitly excluded Audits That‚Äôs kind fucked up.

I don't, we're damn near close 70% already. rural America problems. like care though. Exactly. people ""chose get sick"" need paid sick days? Minnesota, deaths effectively decoupled cases, due vaccinations. That's plan reasonable. (You check MN coronavirus sub see nice graph showing this. Cases hospitalizations gone peaked, deaths remained totally flat, taking account lag cases/hospitalization/deaths). glory nation... nationalist government, people‚Äôs life worth less brick used expand parliament building. hope cases genuinely low, situation nicaragua going through, bother track test, numbers seem low. also really headline making country like india us. duplicate think. find original 9 hours ago.

People San Diego seem wearing masks necessary  accurate.

I know people didn‚Äôt want get tested didn‚Äôt want government know. It‚Äôs ridiculous.

And definitely yes avoiding hospital. Even insurance, hospital stay likely set back thousands dollars here. lot people would rather risk death fall farther debt. time actually go hospital, it‚Äôs late. calculated percentages sensationalized headlines Indiana.

Regardless vaccine passports. vaccine care anyone else fine. feel like carrying around something prove that. Meanwhile, Australia still finished vaccinating 1a group. Granted, there's community transmission could keep borders closed get doses needed, still.  Serbia. vaccines shown quite well variants. Natural immunity, shown strong vaccinated immunity, still form immunity. Look Israel UK (and would argue, US) proof variants stopped. CVSes Florida opened walk-up, no-appointment vaccine distribution. Everyone wants able get within next 4-5 months.

I'm getting second dose tomorrow! Jesus Christ, that? Tucker Carlson loudly railing vaccine sure plan reach heard immunity ""CDC"" keeps saying wear masks around vaccinated people still transmute catch covid even vaccinated. Hmm. even though two weeks accrued sick leave, get covid appointment next Wednesday, allowed collect paid sick leave?  Lol really? government billion laying around help address issue......... Yeah someone else brought thought that. excellent point. Yeah, inaccurate social media comments make lose trust social media comments.  I'm sure joking not. 

You want everyone get vaccines. want create incentive system achieves that.

We want anyone get covid. puts strain hospitals, increases risk bad mutations, around shitty thing wish upon people.

Yeah that's US I've always thought donating J&amp;J AZ stocks India / Brazil. can't afford wait. young people might better waiting Pfizer / Moderna. Yep. know fever. fucking period. Apparently people think business, ""irresponsible"" continue essential worker pandemic. saved PTO actually covid, spread anyone. Optics  r/inclusiveyes Pfizer fam! 100% CDU‚Äôs plan win election:

Step 1) order enough vaccines voters forcing people objectively low risk never ending, hopeless lockdown. 

Step 2) Allow voters leave lockdown refusing vaccinate people objectively low risk stuck lockdown sake protecting vulnerable, free whatever. 

Step 3) ???

Step 4) Profit 

Sure *technically* anyone get AZ vaccine yesterday however we‚Äôve seen many vaccines AZ plans deliver don‚Äôt want fight Hunger Games style competition booster Germany inevitably fails actually buy booster. Incase anyone interested r/stopSmoking virus relying set mutations over. doesn‚Äôt ideas hundreds millions infections.

They could good catching advanced cases symptoms come on. problem spreads highest rate symptoms come on. 

I hate sick avoided high risk categories. I'm excited vaccinated already social. I'm feeling little worried possible mutations. Idk I'm also used isolation I'm almost scared normal stuff Corn, actually. many derivatives, useful! unless know salts/sugars/stabilizers particular batch particular manufacturer...I‚Äôm hesitant, say least. get pancreatitis?  lot workplaces check and/or care. lot workers adept hiding illnesses, especially might mild case (but might much dangerous others around them). assuming vaccines prevent spread. US's strategy developed knew that.  like deceleration It‚Äôs honestly surprising seeing mRNA vaccine similar results inactivated virus vaccine. it‚Äôs true it‚Äôs clearly great news. BC we're basically still inside vists Victoria Day fast?! area started general population last week! matter nearly much everyone else vaccinated. Assuming US, federal program pay COVID-19 treatment uninsured. Check details link providers I‚Äôm glad Kuwait! üëç allergic eggs? flu vaccines produced eggs none mRNA adenovirus vector vaccines are. UK back too, AZ already shared company operations across world Notice article SERBIA. vaccines 100% effective. would still better encourage ill isolate reduce risk everyone else case someone office get strong enough immune reaction vaccine. ignore normally vaccination worried ever happened kids can‚Äôt catch Covid /s I‚Äôm sorry hear this. understanding mechanism causes Covid? severe case? hope well otherwise. Thank sharing experience. Russia‚Äôs government known unreliable untrustworthy. Assuming entire workforce 18+ that's good percentage. Getting vaccinated prevent catching Coronavirus. vaccine increase chances getting hospitalized dying. still need follow basic protocols. One protocols continue follow paid sick leave. actually increases productivity employers sick people spreading flu cold amongst entire workforce. need incentivize people coming work place sick. Stay home, get better get co-workers sick too.  first half homie...  can't USA something like this, people unemployment? first wave, people well-informed took Covid seriously. 


 
By time 2021 came around, people exhausted less willing care Covid. make matters worse, Prime Minister Modi actively censoring information virus, preventing people making educated decisions.  


 
One could make argument lockdown stopped first wave, think lockdown massive failure.

As seen simply takes one virulent strains spin quickly change countries situation. Stay strong. 

How vaccine distribution process going Australia? July 4th, wait mean, 2022, 2023? 2024? going great Canadians minus 25k them?

So semi experts offer better answer question would appreciate it.

What maybe gives answer received 2nd Pfizer shot days ago. symptoms low grade fever ,body aches, chills sweats shot one. symptoms shot 2 well severe worst days. times lasted day half. yang gang strategy restrictions introduced mask wearing indoor public venues (supermarkets, malls etc), masks public transport limits gatherings (no 20 people house, singing dancing public gatherings). they're scheduled end Monday night. introduced precaution give contact tracers time nail down. eradicating virus local herd immunity plenty good enough.  fuck  f'(x)&lt;0  really fair withhold medical leave people CAN‚ÄôT get vaccine Starting get really depressed cause really thought time, would least back normal (in south east asia).

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* course, research mRNA vaccines currently efficient. Difference ain't huge though, think J&amp;J uses spike ""pre-fusion"" stage, similar one used mRNA young efficient prioritizing elderly

So talking age based prioritizing instead contact based prioritizing. explaining exactly young first strategy. know /u/ExtrasiAlb crossing road? prefer ask questions rather assume.

 we're still assuming. hope doesnt count people can't get vaccine ofcourse. hope gives incentive people get vaccine. good decision. coronavirus cases continually falling vaccine-related blood clot cases rising, AZ vaccine starting look like unacceptable risk younger people, depending individual's lifestyle current health. Continuing policy ""you get given"" could led people turning vaccination altogether, obviously bad herd immunity drive. AZ also worrying results B.1.351.

Novavax supposed getting approved soon (I'm surprised approved already), hopefully add supply non-AZ vaccines under-40s get. suspect long Britain quietly decides stop using AZ first doses. think countries sick leave, holiday pay, maternity/paternity leave.

America slow adapt. Fingers crossed they'll near future. Yeah right seemed like good idea first. Aaah, sure Pfizer shot? know counterfeit?  many received 1 vac rather fully? UK Israel saw significant drop offs deaths/infections following 1 jab. Fully vaxed nice, first shot lot carrying. seems common young children, probably sensitive skin. Elderly vaccinated first based research, data expert opinions. probably agreed best strategy reduce deaths quickly possible. elderly begging vaccinated first (they probably were, that's reason vaccinated first).

Now, probably groups might demanding vaccine priority (which possibly deserve) initially actually got priority demands. whole story. elderly vulnerable one them. Yeah see would great. never thought remnant legislation might left previous governments.  US tried help India actually rejected COVID resources. Also, advocating US waive patent rights. showing viewpoint people waiving rights. NZ gvt threaten citizens 5 years jail time $66,000 fines trying return home, Aus gvt did. done research group, who's apparently adamant wash more.

If I'm honest, see lot people washing hands constantly :( Three weeks ago, England (the whole UK would similar) given first doses 95% people older 50%. Whereas 18 50, would vaccinated critically vulnerable health social workers, probably around 25%. much different we've largely second doses first doses 40-50 year olds month.

The US tables often posted threads, seem show around 75% 50s maybe around 45% 18-50s first dose. roughly overall percentage 18+ obviously spread uniformly across ages. seems like either poorly written article poorly written law mention medical exemptions also states people need fully vaccinated get sick paid leave means waiting second dose even first dose get sick still punnished despite attemping get vaccinated. Also denying paid sick leave people sure fire way get people come work covid. seems like law written excuse pay people sick leave pandemic encurage vaccination. Yeah lol. hadn‚Äôt heard problem. did. Everyone demanded priority access demands restriction lifting based vaccination status. 

In Germany every year ""Unwort des Jahres"", like, negative word year. ""fordern‚Äú (demand). dosing elderly reduced dose vaccination young, multiplied early vaccination counts, even loss protection degree individual person, protective effect towards stopping pandemic protecting lives enhanced, even elderly.

Paper 1 peer reviewed yet. looking this, seems like paper 1 discussing strategy elderly still regularly vaccinated first giving young smaller doses earlier. Thus young first elderly later strategy all, even model predicts that, absence vaccination, 72‚Äâ000 deaths (95% credible interval 40‚Äâ000‚Äì122‚Äâ000) would occur Ontario Jan 1, 2021, March 14, 2025, vaccination rate 1¬∑5% population per week, oldest-first strategy would reduce COVID-19 mortality 90¬∑8% average (followed 89¬∑5% uniform, 88¬∑9% contact-based, 88¬∑2% youngest-first strategies). 60‚Äâ000 deaths (31‚Äâ000‚Äì108‚Äâ000) would occur Sept 1, 2021, March 14, 2025, absence vaccination, contact-based strategy would reduce COVID-19 mortality 92¬∑6% average (followed 92¬∑1% uniform, 91¬∑0% oldest-first, 88¬∑3% youngest-first strategies) vaccination rate 1¬∑5% population per week.

Paper 2 literally shows vaccinating elderly first superior method youth first worst now. Still, modelled deaths seem modeled 4 years, would use that. last comparison starts September 1st looks 3-4 years. everyone fully vaccinated anyways, matter (in Ontario anyways)? Even rather useless comparison, youth first strategy still worst. (thinking)

*squats deep thought* pour alcohol gel cracked hands and....aaarrrghhh. Highly doubtful insurance company worth two shits would ever deny claim illness circulation long therefore possible long term effects unknown. see variety carrots sticks offered countries.

I think New York's ""vaccinated people get free Mets tickets get vaccinated stadium"" provide huge surge vaccinations. Two thirds apparently unpaid, legally mandated 65% paid 100% recommended beginning pandemic. cant 5 year old math first sitting like ""ha! 30 bucks? That's it?""

But realized get paid anything get jab :/ many people issue? I‚Äôve problems get it. mean? Well isnt sick.. Same. prick needle, much longer wait? even page refresh, need wait get age group Belgium (40) Actually vaccine misinformation I've seen come Western media. Astrazeneca non Western vaccines dangerous, ineffective, they've blatant lies. type person replied type person shop work still contagious truly belive like flu.

Ignorant beyond belief.  really, buy food week pay bill. But, like others said, 60$ everyone soon, 50$ top pensioners. get money questionable though. get vaccine antivaxxer even avoid vaccine. vaccine mandatory. fear penalized asshole... Pfizer develop vaccine. vaccine made Biontech, German company. based previous research mRNA, funded taxpayers various countries. probably male. know women much, much likely experience side effects.

Nice bit victim blaming though. I'm sure Indian people drowning lung fluid happy American German might maintained.  wrong, buy 3 weeks food 30$ buy shit ton like noodles something. way cover 'most bills' this, unless live shack without water electricity. even enough electricity bill. Thats good!  joking today somebody gonna slingin' vax cards CVS parking lot $35. $20üòÇüòÇüòÇ Wait framing bad thing? took second shot Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine week ago. 10 weeks first shot. 

Yesterday, took 'Anti-Spike SARS CoV-2 IgG Antibody' test, results: anyone else taken test? right thinking vaccine done job? could glad getting shots, still start voting according interests. mutually exclusive. Increased transmissivity variants (Kent and/or Indian) seems sufficient explanation.

If lock enough cut transmission 75%, obliterate ""wild type"" Wuhan (R0 = \~3, R(t) = 0.75), experience exponential growth variants (R0 = \~5, R(t) = 1.25). Either sustainably reduce transmission 80% (or more?), experience degree infection enough natural vaccine induced immunity measures worked work again.

Even so, still partial success story now; experiencing true epidemic situation, situation yet bad even stringent lockdown save vast majority population disease, providing R(t) brought low enough acceptable social economic cost. Many shut take money. cheap people.  Yup, SA. felt excitement üòî. Glad things moving along feels far away saying? patent system holding back progress anything. One look China see strict intellectual property led stagnation, total retardation technological progress last 30-40 years Probably not, downgrade recommended 100% paid sick leave legally mandated 65% sick leave. average two weeks, much pay cut cool US this, especially blocking vaccine material exports, disrupting global supply chains, potentially killing thousands vulnerable people third world countries, could vaccinate healthy young adults anyone else. &lt;3 Australia admitting citizens basis, too. Since want feedback: that's completely stupid flair idea. reason advertising vaccine status (or personal health data, really) prevent disease transmission, Covid (yet?) transmit reddit.

Advertising vaccines fine though,. see adds anything that. Yeah understand feeling. I'm upset rich countries like Sweden order one dose everything everyone earliest possible time.

It would like $200 per person I'm forced pay state television even watch. AZ vaccines also similar results throughout. April fools bit month ago. Best ‚Äúwaiting vaccine‚Äù I‚Äôve read 100M doses stage production site. none used, would one largest manufacture failures world history. really hope sort out. Seems like good way discriminate people may well done anything wrong. Licensing drug product, formulation, brand. individual site would need approval manufacture based production transfer... Say months ish go ahead, since FDA fast tracking approvals, long term stability drug product need proven. (FDA typically wants see 3 months products transferred). Pfizer others setting contract manufacturing anyone willing, seems... there's maybe still would bring fold.

Removal patents give recipe. gives access use molecule manufacturing technique. means creating formulation, assessing efficacy OG product laboratory setting, assessing clinical setting, finally submitting approval. read here: concrete examples link to, biosimilars generics appear market day patent expiry. Firms need assess make enough money development trial programs justify launching competing product. result, many there.

I'm basing professional experience, industry observation. calculated percentages sensationalized headlines Children (0-19) accounting 3% cases vs February. 3. correct, also depends estimated length vaccination campaign (quite long Germany): effects vaccinating old one-shot, effects vaccinating transmitters ongoing.

So quite long vaccination campaign (about 6 months Europe, 20 infections ‚Äúdeep‚Äù) R 1, needles point ‚Äúvaccinate transmitters first‚Äù.

As bonus, vaccinating high-transmitters also efficient way depressing epidemic curve reducing probability emergence new variants, also returning normalcy (which huge loads benefits). country banned flights unvaccinated residents, well opening movies vaccinated people. ""Please stick me!"" flair? Awww... would give left kidney BionTech unfortunately live Germany. Selfish disgusting work America, many selfish people would cry getting $100 got vaxxed.  dangerous. knows virus well truly also knew could carry rallies antiques without much fuss supporters trust him. come point supporters even hold accountable, think mostly country situation government fault. sad. Well can't take excess deaths use number. Life changed pandemic. Less mobility means less traffic accidents. There's almost flu, also.

They probably adjusting things like these. China spare production capacity desire use vaccines, use vaccines? without sick pay, many people would mask symptoms Ibuprofen asked go home. Let get straight:

The order 1.8 billion BioNTech doses taking time expected guy charge managing order French, Die Welt assumes must purpose French people must chauvinistic af hate anything come France?

That's Jedi level bs. conjecture? supporting evidence examples licensing takes less time patent waiver?

Traffic laws equivalent social distancing. Great news. Hopefully EU countries follow example Hungary Serbia start actively distributing vaccine well. much time wasted already. late now, countries quick react China were, would seen similar results. China done everything many countries done, effectively. things looking states dropped mask mandates? businesses still require masks? people still tend wear masks? cases rising here. I've seen 20% coworkers mask since start pandemic. going end election according them. 

One caught Covid almost 3 months. People still come work sick save vacation time.

We given 80 hours sick time use show symptoms. condition use receive Covid test return. They're full hoax even chance positive test. county's covid cases dropped 60% yesterday previous week 50% today previous week.

These vaccines fuckin amazing. nutballs found Pfizer study instructed participants report contact woman got pregnant considered ""exposure pregnancy"".

This abundance-of-caution measure. opposition ran implies Pfizer knows room vaccinated person exposed something, reality barest theoretical possibilities know happen. get stickers either even though husband son did! Happy little flair Kalashnikov accurate though.

So get vaccinated Sputnik might immune covid, sars, smallpox, knows? /S fair, 53% eligible adults usa recently got acid someone getting vaccine. felt ironic. Waiving patents nothing. Companies deliberately patent everything patents public, keep crucial bits trade secrets. Even waived patents today, every single one re-creations would retested validated above. might able force patent waivers companies able force give secrets even know about.

It right strategy back-ended supply Well, EU kind weird organization, nothing similar Earth it. one hand union 27 sovereign countries, agenda policies. hand legislative executive bodies set rules member countries must follow. Absolutely. I've dealing one own. Mainstream news fake unless like headline, news real. fake like headline. Flu vaccine coverage US traditionally neighborhood 45% adults 60% children.

Many european countries don‚Äôt even reach 45% looking subset elderly high risk people typical year. Even *health care workers* don‚Äôt reach 45% many European countries.

(The UK notable exception.)

But hey, don‚Äôt let data get way! legal questions whether EUA medicines mandated. would bypass that. bags also aren‚Äôt 100% effective car proof vests aren‚Äôt 100% drivers aren‚Äôt 100% effective.

That's society abide traffic laws generally encourage everyone part drive safely, mitigate injuries fatalities.

There definitely group people want shot also seems group willing get go way get it.  Getting people slower slowly get percentages time. says plan currently. Hospitals still busy. hospitals busy anymore, countries opening quickly possible.

Here Netherlands even extreme. started opening based hope hospitalisations start trend soon peak currently (thus hospitals busy anymore). Anecdotal vaccine experience (mine):

Turns last blood specimen study sitting fridge due backorder reagent. Testing showed converted back zero titer. HOWEVER, case extremely mild, total 10 lesions barely itched, systemic symptoms. despite fact adults almost invariably get severe cases. Viral load low highly unlikely would transmit virus. immunity level titer ever since. suggesting Covid case vaccine would confer lifelong immunity, pointing immune system zero sum, highly complex. learned extent vaccine hesitant-ness one friends. (She ultimately got vaccinated work required it.) 

First:
She believes covid real takes safety precautions like masks social distancing, almost obsessively instances (she OCD). 
She believe vaccines cause autism, annoyed lumped people believe fringier conspiracy theories.

BUT:
She trust ‚Äúthe media‚Äù report consider full story vaccines.
She believes pharmaceutical companies greedy best interests heart (I tend agree, don‚Äôt think means vaccines dangerous)
She trusts things ‚Äúnatural‚Äù - think would include viruses- ‚Äúchemicals‚Äù. her, vaccine could indeed scarier virus.
Because long term studies covid vaccines obvious reasons, leaves huge, enormous question mark unknown-ness unquantifiable.

I think risk assessment way off, also think OCD may also playing role here, offering perspective lot anti-vaxxers get stereotyped approach makes difference.  logic, really theater point. rules regarding restaurants worst all. wear mask 10ft door table, sit inside surrounded others hour talk eat without mask? completely farcical.

I believe we're hitting point U.S. there's big psychology issue play. live SF CDC local government said stop wearing masks outside, still lot people outside wearing biking/running/etc. reason person wearing mask person B wearing mask, reason person B wearing mask person wearing mask. stupid. No, fucking Illinois, Governor Pritzker made us mask CDC recommended ‚Äúscience experts‚Äù. Yesterday asked could unmask ‚Äúfully open‚Äù. Pritzkers answer. ‚ÄúNo, CDC changes recommendations ‚Äú. ‚Äúscience experts ‚Äú? listened science cdc early on, listen cdc ‚Äúscience. there's 5-10% chance vaccine working also much bigger chance breeding variants. grant priority review tons things. fact people believe means scientific review incomplete irrelevant.

Inactivated virus, protein vector (albeit new well) vaccines great, around longer, thus lot experience existing production capacity, mRNA basically non-existent. 

Opening IP mRNA vaccines might great long term (e.g. 2022), accomplish anything short term.  top covid, forced stay home nothing lament nothing forced miss overtime. Meanwhile one coworkers caught well coughed frequently hard broke rib could get treated tested negative. I‚Äôm aware it‚Äôs worst covid story it‚Äôs testament ignorance maybe absolutely indifference others. Oh sorry, mean imply 0% mental. trying say 100% probability chemical addiction plays huge role. 

My dad said thing habits becomes dependency cope certain mental stresses.

Most people take 90 days actually huge success actually quitting. 

My dad's full withdrawal ""misery period"" 2-3days agony hospital leg infection, suffer cold turkey decades.

And even groups available to, uptake much higher US. Currently China vaccinating 10M people per day recently nearly 300 Chinese already vaccinated least one dose.

Watching going right Germany Canada terrifying American. idea first doses? think number important track whether things slowing not. Check 1.8% Yeah, difficult try understand restrictions like across states everyone seems different definitions strict lockdown.

Was year back pandemic first started? means know much vaccines. opposite true them, covid vaccines included. article bullshit. Meanwhile Southwest fucks around flights, adding layovers previous non stop flights making completely absurd routing decisions. Dallas DC Boston, switched Dallas Phoenix Chicago Boston.

Cant wait second shot Since wages rising, state full employment. That's high school level Economics. Yes, know, another reason bash Teachers cut Education budget.

Cletus, understand we're screwing vote us.

Besides, statistic U1. What's U6? Oh My, huge cushion. LOL Completely agree.  may want wait 10 days positive. would suggest calling. surprise least. I‚Äôve seen chunk cheap ass businesses going ‚Äúrecommend‚Äù get don‚Äôt want forced pay day two post-shot PTO. 

We‚Äôll see long lasts. point someone probably going get covid unsafe workplace sue long haul disability bereavement compensation. good thing. 

Keep - awesome. absolutely love state (MN) terms restrictions + mandates. Nice goal 70% adults first dose happen still gotta get rid mandates July 1. washing often pandemic, soap use avoid issues sold out. 

We stayed home, using soap could find meant normal levels hand washing left cracked, bleeding hands. Lotion help.

I suspect contact allergies supply issues caused issues. data? see number quotes guy^(tm), data. numbers right website. check again?? literally CDC says. provide sources claim claim the
 percentage people died recovered? haven‚Äôt provided single source, meanwhile literally provided CDC website backs factually correct claim. getting natural infection vaccinated works even better! avoid steroid creams? don‚Äôt use regularly, lately it‚Äôs thing clears excema. moisturize regularly, helps isn‚Äôt sufficient right own. There's accompanying twitter thread research findings short videos countries likely going require vaccine passports. cruise ships airlines can't enforce passports, simply cant operate Florida.  money planning riding fact vaccine get full FDA approval, really chance FDA denies isn‚Äôt 100% safe?

On flip-side actually rolling vaccine becoming bit shit-show, we'll trapped country (or locked country) everyone else back 'full normal'. Availability. We're getting point adult anywhere get vaccine. becomes matter personal responsibility. also indication body would've reacted actually got it. probably would worse. Good point. forgot 16+ I've hearing lately 12-15 approval guess 12-15 EUA. know much terms Covid, gastroparesis one ways start bad viral infection. Oddly also caused nerve damage Diabetes. mean, put perimeter around whole city National Guard entry/exit without express permission, commandeered hotels quarantine, slightly ill, positive cases, etc number months.

Everyone's lockdowns different; SouthWestern US many roadways sprawl actually create form checkpoint/lockdown except whole city level. So, restrict travel within city futile. restrict parties, groups, etc everything closed except restaurants takeout, grocery medical. opened back couple months outdoor, opened/closed based upon case load.

We're back nearly everything open week many restrictions, expect normal \~8 weeks.  Psychosomatic health issues almost universal USA. Back pain, neck pain, fatigue, brain fog, anxiety, depression, etc... deep well unconscious heavily repressed rage exists deep minds (especially 'good' people society expects them), cope continue functioning distraction pain needed.

That said, many many cases long covid absolutely due physiological damage body. someone psychosomatic issues after, issue less real person physiological issues, dealt differently. don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre disagreement. think we‚Äôre 1-2 months away already achieving good level immunity majority localities exception states south west. herd immunity probably enough keep cases bay start opening significantly. fact vaccines slowed drastically we‚Äôre probably anywhere 3-4 months away 60 percent vaccine uptake nationally. We‚Äôll see threshold already seen threshold crossed lot high uptake states. states sub low 40‚Äôs basically stopped vaccinating new people. Seems unlikely states ever hit 60 even kids vaccinated drag national average several months. Fortunately don‚Äôt live states seem rural states hit bad covid. think take saying won‚Äôt hit 60 percent nationally several months saying don‚Äôt think ready open worried covid I‚Äôm not. think getting rid restrictions next month two especially state hits 50-60 percent population fully vaccinated. data doesn‚Äôt lie. current pace take two months reach 60 percent nationally rate likely slow time means even ramp little 12-16 qualify month 2-11 qualify next September still take probably 3-4 months hit national average 60 percent. CDC saying turning tide virus know good spot cause they‚Äôre last one party. sober analytical numbers. Basically, say around 300k lives saved lockdown US order reconcile excess mortality 900k covid deaths computed method. article saw attempt describe could happened. fact, seemed discount sorts ""benefits"" adequately compensating increased suicides, overdoses, lapsed medical care due covid lockdown. Welp, know cruise line buying tickets future.

You comparable total amount given, UK given first doses even though open 40s, whereas they've stalled US. reference 8-9 average onset? don‚Äôt believe hunting data couldn‚Äôt find Ah, ok oh yeah right. thought said 65. dad kidney transplant received 3 Pfizer got test antibodies none. Pfizer wasn‚Äôt FDA approved before? schools banking vaccine getting full approval next fall. tricky legal dispute mandate something that's EUA Thank response!! I‚Äôm even better informed people try make excuses üòÅ Even without EUA, biggest clinical trials I've seen. quick google confirms two trials rotavirus vaccines higher enrollment pfizer JnJ trials. vaccines given long time ago like one oral polio vaccines led ""shedding"" basically given enough virus spread it.

Vaccines worked way long time covid vaccines definitely don't. anti vaxxers grab onto kind thing assume happening spread it. also nail coffin NZ/Aus strategy, long term. Vaccines allow exit pandemic, countries think ""Zero COVID"" happening, wrong. going endemic. continue hope end, we'll look back feel like overprepared. better place underprepared,"" said.

Absolutely gutting knowing US panned next 12 months.  probably unconstitutional reminds CA closed outdoor dining everyone went people's houses, causing COVID lot people don‚Äôt time want spend hours driving get one, particularly they‚Äôre young. Though yes, lot anti Vaxxers US, Europe actually more: Good thing people don‚Äôt those. we're including children target. Adjusted pandemic related factors may account Yes need be, everyone arguing point now, US 7% less people one dose UK completely relaxing restrictions another month half? EUA sample size data enormous. vaccine today cant move hand hurts like hell lol dont know people work conditions Yeah ummm... whataboutism here. Maybe go learn real definition. 

It's real simple silly. ""You get zero public services help become infected covid choose get jab"" 

Easy peezy. Nothing like listed. Asking huge lifestyle change? No. Asking massive time commitment? No. Monetary? No. 

Fu cking walk in, get jab. Walk out. Easiest thing life. 

Help us get heard immunity becausep people dying. *MAKE CHOICE* risk sh ut fu ck die quietly, home, without using public funds corona get chose get free shot. 

Discrimination? Nope. Shot free, readily available saves lives. 


In nutshell? Definitely whataboutism, go try ü§£ü§£. clearly anti-mask conservative who'a term thrown insult never learned definition 

And nope none examples fit what's happening here! engaging whataboutism! See psycho conservatives *project* sins others? Whataboutism esentially saying ""BUT ""INSERT BAD THING HERE""!!!!"" discussing unrealistic topic.... like ü§£ think 65+ kids highest uptake, especially require vaccination going back school.

Israel basically declared victory got 56% vaccinations counted 15% recovered also immune. reason think US less 15% recovered fact probably 2 3 times exposed. think we're already home stretch. can't lift restrictions beating virus assholes gate places allowing people skip vaccines due religious purposes.

I've telling hesitant people know talk doctors. people know hesitant really distrustful like, whole internet lol. always bad thing, telling someone got info internet see might enough people.

So family telling people talk doctors family friend recently got vaccinated talking doc! situation they'd already covid believe needed it. Lol anti-vax people always something talk about. can‚Äôt use logic facts get someone position didn‚Äôt use logic facts get into. 

Sure takes away fuel people wary vaccine authorized approved swayed. 

But truly anti-vax people fucking gone. find way back reality. would dramatically increase vaccinations every public university major conference football team*, mention surrounding cities towns.

Without seeing actual data like this, likely believe fully vaccinated means return normal. Even data like this, still might.

Next week really interesting terms first doses hopefully there'll even 2M first doses days company actually started giving bonus got vaccinated couple weeks ago. I've heard certain stores offer free lamination. I'm definitely considering getting mine lamination protect travel. NH correct first dose based population? think percent went down.  unprecedented large country,

well except china lol ""Putin says"" carries much weight ""Trump says"". Well surely less simply natural infection! skip severe disease part Yeah long term companies set global vaccine production? work together companies. Like world. think SII AstraZeneca working together. Bayer CureVac. Janssen Merck. subcontractors like German IDT Biologika drug substance production fill finish pharmaceutical companies produce vaccines. could done example Indian vaccine manufacturers.

Is release IP really needed? short term releasing IP anything, long term companies exactly thing. impossible make contracts pharmaceutical companies set additional production facilities put contract work together local capable producers? need give IP pharmaceutical facilitate additional production well. feeling sake score points get rid IP ""win"" ""big pharma"".

Nothing wrong releasing IP, exactly problem making contract buying pharmaceutical company developed vaccine directly making sure contract many local producers possible get vaccine early possible? Janssen AstraZeneca even selling vaccines profit.

There way much focus releasing IP, real focus producing many vaccines possible future getting world. Releasing IP plays limited part part that. interesting wife mum Pfizer zero side effects. AZ day wife Pfizer spent next 24 hours aches fever.

7% doses compared what??

2) people don‚Äôt want shots. Like, that‚Äôs problem never been. don‚Äôt want it, either provided incentive see reason get it, won‚Äôt get I‚Äôm fully vaxxed, doesn‚Äôt affect me. 

There small category 3. People whose dr recommends don‚Äôt get it. really feel people unfortunately small numbers vaccines exhibit side effects safer them, mask manage risk best possible. concerns based misinformation campaign anti-vaxxers truth evidence.. 

To deal first claim, spike protein vaccine effectively COVID could get damage vaccine COVID:

1. nearly enough spike proteins mRNA injected via vaccine organ damage.

2. Unlike virus, mRNA vaccine replicate body can't grow enough spike proteins harm you. 

3. Lastly, no, random mRNA spikes float around body looking damage something. 

For second point, seems based idea vaccine would cause cytokene storm similar severe COVID cases, that's much body take. difference is, immune response triggered vaccine *not* cytokene storm - mRNA cannot replicate body immune response reach nearly levels would actual COVID. hear lot Pfizer's studies authorizations, what's going Moderna? feel like radio silence since first EUA. spike protein part virus cell, virus itself. spike protein damage organs, illness caused virus does. vaccines deliver spike protein enough train immune system enough get sick vaccine deliver virus itself.

Or think another way, vaccine some, all, virus, can't replicate get sick, enough immune system respond to.

Your immune system learn fight type virus separately. vaccinations exposed things public accumulate immunity hundreds viruses including flu rhinovirus whatever. one different trained fight one. Covid brand new virus world never seen nobody immune initially. vaccines make mostly immune.  Minnesota?

Correct. church like would mixed statuses multiple households meaning everyone masked.    numerous polls starting midyear 2020 showed lot areas ""eager"" demand 40-50% drops there, people ""wait see"" whatever. think exactly we're seeing. Demand got soft promptly 40-45%. US worst lot... France famous US already see areas flatlining like southeastern states. may another bump vaccinations required schools areas probably done.

But opinion we've done sufficient. higher level vaccinations higher population areas spread risk. Gottlieb estimated 30% population exposed back January. probably now. Say half people exposed immune rest immunity. Even overlap vaccinations comfortably adds 60-70%. Wow that's great. Looks like Rhode Island closest herd immunity. cases low couple weeks.

Yes greater distance two groups less chance co-mingling need social norm overlap. density area 100 miles vs 1000 miles, even though density same, 100 mile group higher chance interaction groups. think OP‚Äôs original point homogenous groups comes play.

I‚Äôd also add Northern VA Southern VA one largest alignment shifts comes culture/politics US. Sure, like state positives, also explains attitude bit not? got shot 2:30, worked 3-9. definitely feeling great last hour two shift, able tough out. midnight pretty non-functional, though.  Yeah got second shot waiting week yeah I've going Walmart mask bought online seems fine. Brazil started vaccinating people aged 60+ yesterday. gonna long time wait, way vaccination progressing, think i'll vaccinated next year turning 18 even though i'm included risk group (i diabetes).

The good news though Brazil administered 1.1 million doses yesterday, 51.5 million total. Delusional morons, getting sick wasting precious health resources silly imaginary friend!  Relative mass closures began, yes (at least around neck woods). mass shutdowns (I still hesitate call lockdowns freedom movement restricted, ability congregate certain places) began mid-March earliest places adopt measures mask mandates put place couple months later. 2nd shot Moderna 10:30am Thursday, started feeling like crap Friday morning 9am 6pm, felt perfectly fine woke Saturday morning Agreed Simple question - would rather feel shitty couple days, get Corona? Ahh thanks link, lost first reading someone linked another thread. honestly doubts interpreting results right. says right adverse events slightly higher expected general population explained closer monitoring vaccine recipients, fact number lethal cases much lower expected points conclusion - vaccine recipients closely monitored treated. states contact tracing Google Apple? already track every move phones, hard would implement contact tracing? vaccine already gone necessary safety trials. determined FDA safe effective months ago (when got emergency approval).

The additional time needed full approval nothing safety, additional testing efficacy time.  Masks public transport forever way go.

A set 10 KN95s costs $7.80. enough wear different mask 10 weekly commutes. commute ~ 1 hour long, mask remain protective ~ 20 hours use. breaks 8c/day wear mask helps protects everyone else. think it'll be, ""It FDA approved long enough"". Whatever means. need tie student football ticket allotment.

But I'd surprise end mandating like meningitis. Lol... like 40% marines gotten vaccine. friends old unit hell bent not. It‚Äôs typical ‚ÄúI beat ez virus yut‚Äù mentality Yeah, country always get aid sick rave, need doctors note prove. Exactly. horrible idea. really gives f##k India. family give control select new leader stop BJP  beginning pandemic got laid (""furloughed"" trendy soft buzzword use time). see unemployment checks come long time, got nervous took first job came through. small/local HVAC company whatever reason entire work force, even marketing (my position), working office. showed day one, shocked see people absolutely PACKED tiny office space. I'm talkin' desks hallways, masks noses, zero windows, zero ventilation, nothing. orientation, told us random drug tests, vacations allowed summer. None disclosed interview process.

The icing cake, guess ones working home whole time? guessed it. FUCKING OWNERS. Boy, rub wrong way. left first day straight depressed. never felt trapped scammed entire life. went next day quit, fully knowing could ruin chances getting unemployment checks ever. Luckily, worked end able 1099 whatever is, unemployment checks finally came lump sum shortly after.

Wow, months ago day I'm still rubbed wrong way place cowardly selfish owners. I‚Äôd really like see question answered. fear getting long Covid what‚Äôs kept living paranoid hermit lifestyle past 14 months. significant fraction people contract Covid-19, lingering symptoms go months even year now. many mild acute cases.

So it‚Äôs important know vaccinated makes long Covid unlikely going hospital dying virus. Hopefully doc address concern! Virginia large population meaning evens Ireland less dense. agree point say REALLY making jealous Australians right now. Awesome dashboard. Heres [lithuanian Although works best desktop (mobile version doesnt show stats)  spouse works vaccine clinics national guard crazy many gotten yet, aside normal anti-vax /crackpot reasons wanting it, cite required yet

Which insane reason get it, Oh getting half teaspoon betadine shaking nose spray bottle Walgreens. There‚Äôs also halodine betadine cheapest. also use baby shampoo. used propolis instead.  Well stores around policies feel safe with, it. 

Personally, combination double vaccinated Pfizer little n-95 mask wear comply posted rules makes worry world. Okay random redditor. gotta you. keep trying spread misinformation shit know nothing about. talking basic research people invest lot money something without never knowing pan out. taking away patents people got research tell them, basic research even pan discover something amazing, less people ready invest next long shot. Yes Ireland also smaller terms square miles/km, regardless density think point still stands. Ontario, Canada. verify get first dose, get appointment second dose scheduled 4 months historically, time necessary, beaurocracy system.  EU truly magical place. pretends one community convenient then, suddenly, convenient they're back individual states. New Hampshire 74.5% 18 population least one shot, course that's Ireland compares to. 

I'm going start randomly excluding Mississippi Alabama comparison conversations like EU countries conveniently get countries like Romania Latvia. Yeah, already use pumice stone shower time time practice aerial silks lyra, calluses get control, rip cause issues. make sense exfoliation. definitely need lotions though, can‚Äôt get away O‚ÄôKeeffe‚Äôs, TJ‚Äôs hand cream crazy moisturizing, non-greasy use even right practice zero issues. Basically reference article [True COVID-19 death toll double official numbers, study references IHME study[estimation excess mortality due covid 19](http://www.healthdata.org/special-analysis/estimation-excess-mortality-due-covid-19-and-scalars-reported-covid-19-deaths)  meant wait almost 3-4 months approval. applied approval long back. approval happened things went control. I'll edit comment clear know could get vaccinated? Really high risk gotten yet, going. sounds like absolutely terrible model. glorious Window's Pho... OH GOD, HAPPENED ONEPLUS!? Good fucking show dumbasses.

We church/congregation central europe kinda same. 60 infected, 2 dead. mad.  recent poll says 85% people Ireland intend vaccinated, 10% unsure 6% saying refuse (yes know numbers add 101% presume due everyone must vaccinated, take antibody test prior boarding? would weed assholes.

Actually two tests. Bring results one board. take another board. Thing is, understand people hesitant mRNA vaccines. even understand hesitant traditional ones created quickly. I'm well aware they're safe, I've got two shots now, understand, *especially* following closely.

But vaccinated want wait understand vaccine side effects... means need keep non-vaccine stuff protect virus. buying fake cards going around naked face. No, would expect proportion unvaccinated people reduced requiring everyone get vaccine get vaccine. hope something changes Florida. state made illegal schools require CovID vaccine returning classes. Students still get vaccinated sorts things go school, CovID. Classic Florida. mRNA incredible new technology. German companies invested lot money time research hold lot patents. patents mRNA vaccines waived research become public knowledge give companies incredible leg up.

Just waiving patents suddenly make companies able produce vaccine. That‚Äôs like snacking üò¨ intentionally. I'm speaking seems nobody wants discuss seems obvious. actually good news?  it, Reddit! Canada still going ‚Äúeveryone gets first dose anyone gets second dose‚Äù approach apparently. 2% full vaccinated like 40% first dose. know people got scheduled second dose Pfizer 4 months Funny. allowed call names, call names, auto-mod removes post. ""Civility"" Absolutely there's lag, mentioned post likely higher lag. Unfortunately can't jump conclusion say x x without knowing details 6 cases like previous person without data, (since pointed out, there's range events occur), say far least \~1 million based data have. 100% first vaccine (and practice 90% second dose) yes. never get without mandating vaccinations. practice uptake likely 90% supply come much sooner. Especially FHM decides use J&amp;J. One third washing hard enough Represent ü§ò Think forgot switch accounts replying buddy  Yep, father one tourists, even travelled Serbia purpose seems smaller old-school local companies frustratingly eager people come back office. reason? control lives people work you?

Disney little faster moving people cooling tent, it‚Äôs time requirement ended. costs way it‚Äôs helpful.   Hello, I'm FDA approve it, vaccinate world, goodbye. Damn, got donut protection deadly virus. dont understand stimuli money tied vaccine. Fuck fucks take $ anything help stop pandemic best, controlled studies show gives pretty good immunity while. Like 80% 6-month mark. confirmation bias refusal learn. 

You hostile multiple comments now. personal issues something? reactions surprising strange given conversation. June 15th

Maybe me, use word ""weeks"" periods time month.

Christmas weeks away! 33 them! apologies, reason assumed UK/Germany.  learned recently [R0 initial rate transmission, Rt tracking evolving rate Think many people live alone rarely go out. There's lot less reason shower shampoo/style hair seeing anyone.  According article, 83% seniors gotten least 1 dose.

I truly understand 17% refuse get vaccine.  totally antivax even hesitant changes mind little $100, I‚Äôll respect even less. Would support creation use clinical trial report cards make easier public understand results? 

Putting toxic death rate percent serious adverse event rate front really helps people compare treatments. 

These vaccines look much safer easily see killing anyone putting hospital clinical trials. 

In sharp contrast, doxycycline come favorably terms safety. want this. really want this.

People got Covid fault punished, vaccinated people get mild breakthrough infections decades punished. 

A hospitalization severe illness could preexisting condition, threshold propose cause harm good. come free insulin? Considering poor uneducated likely refuse vaccine, would probably amazing effect.  Nice. Mobile clinics going places unvaccinated people would help lot. get vaccinated way sports game, work, it‚Äôs lot harder procrastinate it.  That's loop, hit every Krispy Kreme proper dozen 2nded. wife wanted go Caribbean, started researching options. price week long cruise less going individual locations week, went it. there, obvious we'd made mistake, pretty well trapped. good days escaped ship St. Thomas, hailed cab take us scuba session we'd arranged independent cruise line, day spent San Juan. try block memories trip, I'm still haunted image fat middle aged ladies cafeteria trays piled capacity hot dogs. know many hot dogs ship, people them, seems like got another tray every time got another beer.

That cruise reason I'll never another inclusive anything trip ever again.  Cringe edgy like NPR New York Times, also Dispatch formed conservative viewpoint also business model keeps click-baity. Maybe make explainer many extra doses could create 2021 2022. much vaccine doses cost compared currently. development costs included costs well, production costs? Hopefully. batch came India. time EU countries insisting doses come UK production lines. insistence made suspect something might wrong indian production line. 

The following batches came Russia IIRC. that, talks batch numbers vaccines certificates started emerge, got certificates. I‚Äôm point understand misinformed person lose confidence particular version vaccine. Nah, believe we'll give Chinese lot land exchange build something interest, potentially ruining environment quality life nearby residents  Wtf Already got mine. MONEEE PWEEEZE! similar reports fungal infections early China. Meijer too, they‚Äôre regional. Oh shoot, forgot.

Russia bad, beware communist vaccine. I'm sure understand, PTO taxed cash. get Astrazeneca? I'm early tweens. worth risk? (In country recommended age) wait? he‚Äôs idiot. Yeah definitely need supplemental oxygen case.  would know this? they‚Äôre getting educational support need. anyone else little nervous going back normalish life? Got vaccinated going club still worries me.

but else do? card allow access services locations. Sputnik Zero next? political statement say that. political statement say ""you evil person this."" agree you. think misunderstood other. referred original commitment delivering 300 million doses vaccine EU first second quarters.  bought tons ventilators turned hospitals covid hospitals. people dying mass diseases conditions, can't get treatment basically anything else requires hospitalisation, besides covid Per day. They'll give free one every day vaccine card. Per day rest year.  Sure, you‚Äôre still looking backwards point out. current problem one vaccine hesitancy. got really isn‚Äôt important anymore want solution-minded. people reddit really seem think US (or anywhere, really) gonna keep 3 million doses day moment came anti-vaxxers. There‚Äôs magical idle factory. 

That exactly saying. Hopefully rhetorical question, haha. Thanks update. Sometimes hate living I'm super grateful vaccine uptake. Businesses always guaranteed make money. course that's goal, give restaurant owners bailout money, incentive open back up?! 

Ironically that's EXACT logic Republicans using deny relief general public. political statement say wear mask pandemic?

The fact ""one side"" wearing masks ""the other"" mean masks political. means half country listen health experts talk.

If one half country says ""the sky blue"" half says red, make sky color political topic? Please no... don‚Äôt want type reproducing. Neither mine pedals, foot boards call ‚Äòem.   guess 4-5 months long time, hard believe complete 180 made, large part thanks vaccine. 

Reportedly lowest cases last 7 months, think New Years Eve 2021, COVID-19 behind us?

It seems whole entire process gone fast... Pennsylvania announced end mask mandate 70% vaccinated, think Minnesota might first provide hard date.  Omg 15 days? stopped yet? That's bad wonder India‚Äôs rolling 7 day average new infections deaths compares worst US peak? Per capita. look data see truth.

Lol that's rich. ""We"" barely understand herd immunity, let alone pinpoint exact time safe return normal pandemic. Oh man, triggering cable company anger. ""We would like thank loyal customer jacking price celebrate give new guy deal"". Second Pfizer shot immune response started kicking ass around 4AM. Wokeup worst chills I‚Äôve ever felt life. Felt like drug addict quit cold Turkey. Could barely get bed shivering bad. Wokeup headache well that‚Äôs gone away now. def confirm second shot hits harder

I fine day. Went cinco de Mayo wokeup lol count chickens hatch though. still idea much costs (while agree money world express cost human life, doubt Sinopharm cheap. Maybe could gotten something else less money?). state california mandated 80 hours paid sick time covid related absences, including getting vaccinated vaccine side effects   you, maybe. someone works home desire leave house point, not. I'm vaxxed, still plan changing I'm living life. work daycare, I'm high risk, working home, could easily wait, shop better deal, that's things going next months. even make option, people think last pandemic lifetime, bless them, people remember play this. 100% there‚Äôs reason flu cases year. That‚Äôs still encourage using masks symptoms cold like asian citizens feel sick. Here's update Massachusetts, 3rd first doses total pop 2nd total doses administered. Beating u/Wizmaxman it.

Notes: 

* Pfizer EUA expanded age 12, eligible population updated approximately 6,101,782, estimated 12+ population using 2020 census (7,029,917 overall) (not 2019 estimate). FDA EUA 12-15 expected soon, probably sometime next week could decided restrict countries ordering capacity private companies within borders. not.

They could decided set policies restricts export doses domestically produced private companies ordered doses delivered. not.

Even though though doses, enforce gets im/exported (as EU). Exactly way US controlled executive orders, contracts DPA. EU ordered hundreds millions doses invested billions billions euros development production. private companies would allowed export policy, would choice fulfill EU order (which consists billions doses anyways) deliver everything EU.

Japan bought Pfizer doses wherever Pfizer could deliver them. Purely EU allowing Pfizer export everything want wherever want. US allow this. Thus Japan got vaccines EU. US stopped this, orders might also fulfilled US, instead EU. course makes sense coming EU anyways, EU Pfizer production capacity far exceeds US. create real Corona partys. get rights back vaccinated recovered Covid . much chance get vaccine soon catching Corona seems way .

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* sadly correct way. Vaccinating vulnerable ASAP quickest way out. First get deaths low, hospital ICU admissions severe disease. step reach, consequences COVID-19 gets lower lower, thus restrictions loosened. want give many people possible freedom, decide give fully vaccinated group freedom again. creates unfair split society creates uneven environment people need protection gradually get rights, people protected less freedom. unfortunately quickest road less measures giving many people possible freedom. could also decide give fully vaccinated people freedom, fair, means follow quickest road less measures giving many people possible freedom.

Vaccinating way around significantly less effective. keeps vulnerable population vulnerable virus thus keeping overall consequences infection high. means measures stay bit longer. Opening things would mean severe consequences groups. would open things already vaccinated vulnerable group, might still higher level infections compared vaccinating way around, means consequences infections much lower, thus restrictions loosened earlier.

The importance prevention like:

1. Deaths
2. ICU admission
3. Hospital admission
4. Severe disease
5. Long COVID (extra)
6. Symptomatic COVID infection
7. Asymptomatic COVID infection

Start elderly, logically follow list top bottom. Start younger people primarily starting clusters, move bottom top. Pretty obvious prolific countries also get hate. Jealousy, schadenfreude, wishing karma bad things. pretty bet schadenfreude UK back empire started collapse. French that, etc. 85% individuals 60-75 gotten least one shot. reasonably expect? everyone going get vaccine. technically correct. EUA means solutions benefits outweigh potential risks alternative public health crisis. 

As footnote, actually read studies see vaccines super duper safe super duper effective, particularly mRNA vaccines. 

Moderna: saying doubting safety, anyone else fence reading this. are, please get vaccine. day body aches fever far better catching covid.  Well, elections coming boomers already got shots.

This efficacy death ""bad"" real world data: they're measuring day death. actually go back try figure many deaths infected second dose, deaths go away.

There yet single confirmed anecdote someone infected fully vaccinated dying it. course happen eventually, could well happened already yet confirmed. must extremely rare. think mobile; force desktop old Reddit view. Another highly allergic person chiming in! 

I flu shot years ago put ICU four days, extremely leery immunizations country live in?

July 1 last day anyone get vaccine gets covid care free. Either get vaccine pay pocket. Let insurance companies refuse cover unvaccinated people well.

Kids, people compromised immune systems still covered alternatives.

I agree owner/operators beliefs - private company....what do? think people delaying children pandemic largely people *broke* rather poor. plenty young couples pandemic precarious position terms employment strapped money, decently educated, raised view parenthood choice, access contraception. people delaying parenthood. entirely different demographic people trapped inter generational cycle poverty view way knowledge recourses necessary plan reproductive lives. American? It‚Äôs ultimately boss work company 500 less employees boss get tax credits paying long need Nah.... money, time... Athletes older degrade... olympics x amount time...

But boss agree taking tax credits, that‚Äôs catch biggest fiasco 'masks necessary/Covid-19 transmit air significantly' stage CDC messaging. course stage anti-masking message justified 'lol, trying save N95 masks hospitals.""

I actually want part 2020 probed congress see anything political going Trump CDC.   relate parent, happen pediatric infectious disease specialist, too! Pfizer submitted data 12-15 year olds FDA reviewing speak.

The CDC Advisory Committee Immunization Practices meeting next week review data make recommendation add authorization age group. trials underway younger children, reason concern safety efficacy vaccines. (Moderna trials also).

I excited get teens vaccinated soon authorization approved. vaccines new, important note unprecedented amount immediate data million persons vaccianted US already months. vaccines differences safety efficacy adults children aware of. ‚Äì¬†Dr. Pan U.S. already started exporting. forget storing vaccines -70 feasible tried change second appointment closer location, appointments available. still spend 30 minutes road.. Yeah makes sense company gave us both. got money shot claim PTO appointment(s) Saturdays. Duh! right PTO tho think experts pretending doesn't. know extent, hard make policy completely sure whether it's, say, 30% 90%. Unfortunately media general public tends interpret things binary way (either does, doesn't), without understanding scientists answers day 1 and, like everyone else, progressively gaining insight go along.

Once experts communicate public vaccine prevent transmission, going hard walk back statements turns true. That's CDC (and health agencies around world) conservative this. pretending ""wear mask evil"" messaging one side. knew wasn‚Äôt going happen right away. history said wouldn‚Äôt happen. Birth rates always gone pandemics time economic distress, Spanish Flu, Great Depression, 2008 recession. slump seems largely continuation trend though largely directly related COVID Nobody brain would ever *want* host Olympics status. terrible waste money nowhere near economic benefit countries hope will. I‚Äôve shots! want $100 retroactively!  IOC secure vaccines? would need hundred thousand happen without hitch. UK stating seniors get booster fall. happen US?

You can‚Äôt look cases, look hospitalizations deaths. 

It shitty vaccine, case flu one one complains.  I've seen guy made speak. think Modi wanted happen?

However, whether send doses elsewhere first policy problem, really scientific one, comment that. BioNTech hold patents mRNA technology used vaccine, far understand, would get dwarfed patents get waved big pharma States.

Fair point, assuming country going punish workers even given chance get vaccine? think, absence law, refused vaccine would willingly go get tested virus either feel immune even believe in? UAE Chile also still extremely high case rates despite high percentages populations vaccinated. major common thread seems they're mostly using Chinese vaccines.

If full stimulus check, would lot harder resist.  That‚Äôs kinda dumb  they‚Äôre asymptotic may encourage people try hide sick though. 

Paid sick leave incredible tool keep safe healthy work place. Oh, weird. guess seen heard that. really make sense criticize Canada given y'all going make like 1/3 deaths per capita...  China's GDP 5x. think similar. Also, Chinese leaders believe science. example one live in, Netherlands. first wave, excess death 2x confirmed deaths. Mostly people dying home nursing homes, never taken hospital. International criticism dismissed many Dutch people saying part Dutch culture let die sick. Pharmacists make pretty good coin doubt they'd risk jobs 20 Many American workers currently get paid sick leave anyway unlikely motivated threat losing something have. Dear god amount people twitter tiktok I've seen say 'the vaccine stops severe disease, stop getting COVID spreading mask up' makes want blow brains out.

I recommend people give crap they're going, limited get experience. want go vacation sake it, sure. idea staying grounds property/whatever property sounds boring me, friends go Mexico this. 3 weeks sick leave 700 hours personal leave banked...def getting vaccine. Got Pfizer shot #2 2 12 hours ago. Sore arm, side effects far. Every employer everywhere something like this. also think employer wants make mandatory someone gets vaccine, pay employees sick leave catch said illness (flu, covid,etc) understand. went restaurant, bar casino friends day two weeks second shot. get there, even baby steps gonna see fear unnecessary. fine. matter come sick everyone wants vaccinated is? gave ton pto shots (in addition sick time) $100 bonus. still hold outs. UK death rate 10% US per capita even though countries pretty much equal vaccinations. $100, I‚Äôd get invest money AMC stock.

Not good system 574 shots record high? 0.014 shot for?  You‚Äôre denial think people care random human beings would love tax break well actually, so. iirc, placebo group, also needle piercing shoulder, reported far fewer incidences pain injection site actual vaccine group. think difference something like 15% placebo vs 80% vaccine group doubt people stayed locked homes. Everyone get can. higher vaccination rates sooner go back normal. localized herd immunity even matter much? If, say, US reached herd immunity, virus mutate countries herd immunity able bypass immunity US US immunity goes away time?

Yes. There's J&amp;J. Rationally, there's little risk catching Covid, even less getting severe case, even there's someone else club full blown infection keeps coughing everyone. anxiety rational, hard switch mindset we've last year -- crowds dangerous -- go back partying like use to. 

So do, try ease back it. Start going less crowded cafes crowded outdoor spaces like zoo farmer's market, comfortable around people again. mad people won‚Äôt get vaccinated. 

It‚Äôs easy shit it‚Äôs free. 

There thousands dying daily worldwide don‚Äôt access vaccine, Americans selfish get couch go get one. 

It‚Äôs height privilege selfishness. want $900,000 get vaccinated Apparently encountered people ignorant cannot even trust experts. I'm glad case put basket yours. different circumstances. want job tax PTO! No, India can't keep track deaths normal times.

Look death per 1M almost every country worldometers.info. Almost (that believed; ignoring Russia, Iran, Turkey, China, etc) floating 1300 2000. India reporting 168 per 1M. 

There's absolutely way total deaths least 5x higher reality. 10x would put average. 

This also factoring fact country 1.4 billion people densly populated cities. What's mysterious counting? many students struggle loans, one way get vaccinated lol ignoring (for part) situation Hungary is/was far worse? - approaching 0.3% population dying Covid

1.5% die every year, excess death counts. significanty outstanding. Yeah maybe it‚Äôs peaking, slowing would real stretch say *are* people long-hauler category lasting symptoms, vaccines always improve condition (approx. 40% report improvement). There's still much understand virus. You‚Äôre going get kinds noise look day day variations. Especially case counts get smaller.

Also vaccination campaign going shittyly starting catch wind sails (today 30% Germans received first shot. 8.9% received both).

JFC, that‚Äôs truly scary. Government statistics might reporting around tenth actual deaths. 40,000 people India dying COVID every day now. correct FDA purview countries; however, small countries typically budget operate massive regulatory body conduct site inspections. extensive network doctors provide advisory decisions.

So, practice, regulatory bodies review documentation labelling ensure conforms expectations, leverage FDA EMA approvals actual drug product facility say product manufacturing site safe.

Regarding product linked, that's also medication falls generic rules, biosimilars. Functionally public generic biosimilar thing: name brand drug, often produced cheaper.

In practice, they're different. Generic medications utilize molecule metabolized body order create new molecule supports body's processes. biosimilars, providing proteins something like actually stuff body. incumbent applicant *prove* product thing original. Insulins example this, antibody therapies.

1. Vaccines target spike protein virus. Everything hear news variants discussing mutations spike protein. spike protein virus uses entry cells, therefore important transmissibility, also appears dominant antibody response. However, individuals infected Covid antibody response made spike protein. find antibodies viral proteins equally neutralizing would influenced changes spike protein. theoretically could harder virus mutate away population scale due less selective pressure since mutations also influence transmissibility like spike variants do; either way previously infected individuals would antibodies parts Covid virus beyond spike protein could protect variant strain
2. Since Covid respiratory virus infected individuals develop high levels mucosal antibodies would protect airways (these called IgA). current vaccines develop systemic IgG response, yes enough neutralize virus effectively seen, mucosal IgA may improve quick clearance virus infection take hold. 

There still large questions durability responses, yes vaccine may produce higher spike antibody response natural infection, points scientists making valid need considered.

Nobody mentioned EU did? Even N95 95 percent effective filter.

Tiny quibble: N95 standard means tested *at least* 95% effective test conditions penetrating particle size (which interestingly enough actually smallest). 95% effective particle sizes, likely 95% effective even penetrating particles, since that's minimum standards classification. particle sizes produced even proportions, level concern. hand, none really matters masks poorly fitted gaps around seals.  agree need mask mandates go away soon, demarcation line that, cannot say.

Honestly, that's important criterion means. Expected years life lost clearly important, example; that's one (e.g. arbitrage GDP also clearly needs done, although clear level). I'm doctor, take steroids infrequently control medical issues.

Steroids cause havoc body's systems, including immune system.

Frequent use steroids lower effectiveness treat issues. Also, side effects coming steroids become pronounced longer may taking them.

Topicals effect lesser extent, well causing issues skin becoming thinner weaker time.

1. COVID spike protein responsible damaging organ tissue, receive mRNA vaccine, type spike protein created. Therefore, creating spike protein administration vaccine, organs risk way COVID puts risk.
2. mRNA vaccines essentially force immune system ""overpower"" body's natural defense mechanism. antibodies normally used fight things like influenza rhinovirus prior receiving vaccine ineffective vaccine essentially modifies RNA create stronger antibodies wipe normal antibodies, called ""broad spectrum antibody neutralization.""  

Is truth this?

3. absolutely information post-vaccine day 6 events occured
4. Due extraordinarily small number events compared observed population (number indviduals received second AZ dose), misinterpretation events occured change incidence dramatically. Let give example. reports tend come weekly. 6 events occured within timeframe updated 2nd vaccine doses events (ie. events occured days 1-7 post vaccine time reports last updated), would give 1 5.9 milliion. two weeks, would higher incidence, 3 weeks, would higher still. Whatsmore, even difference 1 event came make seemingly large difference incidence since small (e.g difference 1 million (=1/1000000) 2 million (=1/500000) effectively doubles incidence). last point really interpret data without knowing events occured really work data rather push assumptions since inflate incidence. way know either data published whereby know sure 6 amongst first 2.3 million later groups **or** reason paused AZ second doses 3 weeks let cases catch-up (which highly unlikely) **or** wait everyone 2nd dose AZ continue monitor afterwards (which do).

Hope clears up!

EDIT: downvote him, good learning point Hopefully come shortly. Otherwise think you‚Äôll see lot colleges backtracking requirement. think they‚Äôre banking done start fall semester. ended getting second dose, still ringing ears, getting better time goes on. spoke ENT basically said nothing could done aside wait hope goes away. gotten point longer driving crazy, something notice time time. Hopefully time it'll go away completely.

So, unfortunately, real good news I'm getting used it. New Zealanders allowing citizens back India several days now. Yeah, ""experts"" seem think pandemic reached end here. opening everything again. That‚Äôs silly take. It‚Äôs like 6 weeks away, perfectly reasonable say ‚Äúweeks‚Äù. would say? Can‚Äôt say ‚Äúmonths‚Äù. We‚Äôre ‚Äúa month 2 weeks‚Äù away sounds silly too.

Is really formality point? include children formal FDA approval. one thing author writing incorrect nonsense several times already.

I'd expect person giving vaccine shot vaccinated first place.  BIG PHARMA FUNDED Hi OP. Everyone reacts vaccines differently, definitely know people within family felt ill temporarily others not. live USA 18yrs old, Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine available single injection would make feel better getting vaccinated. 

some people feel temporarily unwell, actual virus possibility making feel unwell longer periods time causing permanent damage. CTAP program offered last summer.... looking countries vaccinated 2024. corrupt covid death numbers? I've noticed Balkan countries near top deaths per capita world Serbia allegedly 70s. card cursed  fact seeing third wave pushing lot people get 1st doses quickly. 

I somewhat agree. also think general, Canada less comfortable high death rates United States, see responses upticks case numbers states started opening again.

Additionally, better worse, tend 'compliant' government, maybe product fundamentally less polarized states. 

I think overall make start losing appetite vaccine comfortably hit 60% adults, still make 70s start stall. Combine eligibility young, think we'll hit 70% overall population end summer. Appealing greed always succeed. Whatever works IMO. 10 million people die India every year average. Reagan right government problem. failed mention Vietnam War crippled generation, literally financially.

&amp;#x200B;

This one thing many leads wonder question think going forward point general observations. something read said. see say said response another: "" Current data suggest existing COVID-19 vaccines offers protection known variants."" 

&amp;#x200B;

So get hearing often. know people work local hospital vaccinated. say take booster another shot. site fact gotten covid vaccines. few, including boss one women know, put ICU regional hospital. vaccinated months ago second shot. quite others know get sick. teachers vaccinated ending virus couple fairly ill later quarantine entire classes students contact none vaccinated yet.

&amp;#x200B;

Have heard several doctors healthcare people claim would never take another vaccine good variants.

&amp;#x200B;

So question vaccine getting word dispelling stuff booster. healthcare professionals are, level, pushing may hard going forward.

&amp;#x200B;

Question: see information vaccine effective variants something may interfere people taking booster one needed?  fair, current India government pretentious. Modi announced Feb international stage India successfully defeated pandemic. House Pfizer reporting in! impression side effect want watch regarding Moderna/Pfizer vaccines anaphylactic response (less 0.001% chance), order catch that, nurses/doctors vaccination site monitor people receive Moderna/Pfizer vaccine shot 20-30 minutes. see anaphylactic response, respond immediately (e.g. injecting Epipen). 

It also impression side effect want watch regarding J&amp;J vaccine blood clot (also less 0.001% chance), order catch that, need patient report back doctor experience symptoms like severe headaches, abdominal pains, shortness breath, etc. report doctor, doctor treat blood clot. 

A blood clot appears 2 days shot seems difficult detect anaphylactic response appears minutes shot. mean Moderna/Pfizer vaccine side effects easier detect treat, average?  AZ doses work better 12 week gap vs 4 week feel personally attacked. mean exporting anyways.

Or least building plan near future. USA flair? season? sure nobody distancing anymore? seriously doubt that. Indian governments massively, massively undercounting deaths. first wave too, even worse now. 

Gujrat's chief minister openly said person diabetes dying covid, actually counted death due diabetes, covid secondary cause.

Meanwhile Justin Trudeau, Bill Blair, Dr. Tam said international travel contributes less 1% cases Canada. community spread workplaces, lol. Vaccines work stimulus unless get vaccinated? would start serious riots.... would think spending year locked homes would enough motivation take free vaccine üôÑ Actually think that's job Justin Trudeau, Public Health Canada Dr. Tam. bad they're incompetent fucked vaccine rollout wait 4 months 2nd dose that's reason given back freedom vaccinated Canadians like CDC done vaccinated Americans. Keep trying harder. Welcome US fast food industry. Even covid. I‚Äôm fully vaccinated! Love flairs! They're anyway. Every superspreader event - Spring Break, Sturgis Rally, etc., people worst. acknowledge understand they're doing. Actions consequences personally feel bad anymore they're fired, expelled families friends made feel welcome. whole idea community function together people made very, clear want so. Except US people getting vaccinated probably paid sick leave anyway. Temp check mostly useless, definitely made various manufacturer/seller $ first AZ shot two days ago. even feel needle. First night insomnia next day aches. Couple paracetamol good.

My wife typical side effects, chills shivers lasted couple days. again, treatable basic pain killers. Cute fun waiting 4 months 2nd dose staying eternal lockdown we're literally opened fully vaccinated. July 4th going great Americans.  Damn that's month 2% population. People want rights none responsibilities. Serbia's policy fair. Motivation never get covid test come work sick...

Absolutely moronic policy. sound mad people aren‚Äôt like you. never said refuse. would quicker $100 though. political bullshit Liberals like give flying fuck suffers not. 

The thing hilarious even discuss opening people 1st dose vs Trudeau making people waiting 4 months 2nd dose.

If Canada's government competent leadership, would've accquired needed vaccines time back Jan/February could've fully vaccinated lockdowns lifted. 

Oh well though, USA, UK, EU continue re-open guys stay lockdown. incentive. also get paid get flu shots happen every year.  you‚Äôve ever part valley, story would surprise you. Hospital, don‚Äôt want desaturate beyond without supplemental oxygen medical staff. Sorry valid participating US locations Make sure he‚Äôs wearing correctly sitting straight feet ground. definitely take readings spaced several minutes get baseline.

Also make sure he‚Äôs holding breath it‚Äôs measuring.  I'm vaccinated fully, honestly requirement coming back office vaccinated...
- I'm lying saying never got vaccinated. 

Fire me. care. 

The office, commute taxes suck bad. I'd rather collect unemployment bit find new job return office hellscape.

They require it, saying - I'm still gonna lie. actually really wants return shared bathrooms, mandatory in-person meetings, crappy breakroom, commute annoying co-workers? *shudders* Surely herd immunity would bringing R number zero restrictions place

Every person gets Coronavirus heals number people actions? unvaccinated types

Yes, including people unable rather unwilling take vaccine. take public transport infect children elderly well. trolls morons like you. Public Health Canada announced guidelines lifted restrictions individuals 1 dose completely protects you? CDC already done so. 100 tacos. covid surges linked seasonality, maybe Florida's warmer climate \*partly\* suppressed transmission kept away complete disaster? Tomorrow afternoon change flair FV. then... different (in world, anyway). Aw that's cute keep spewing bullshit liberal ;) government fucked country, period. Nice troll comment mean shoutout good way Oh smack!   guys get sick leave? negative eyes (other whole illness death). anti-vax states already open need vaccine live life Boston vaccinated city America told today wait month even considering adjusting 8/22 opening date. reference low single digit daily deaths state sub 1% positive test rate. Likewise, stragglers incentive move faster since using data rather waiting get data NYC, LA Chicago open. GOOD! #incentives Ok start medical provider nurse extensive experience covid patients. would highly highly recommend goes ER. 90-92% rest likely destarurating 80s movement activity. sounds like needs supplemental oxygen days possibly medications like steroids. I'm friends quite nurses range high school valedictorian master's Ivy barely graduating local juco wind working places (albeit different roles pay). Nurses whole huge mixed bag different types. Right you‚Äôre relying everyone else get virus eradicated, refuse part help. 

Too many people can‚Äôt see attitude exact reason virus still around. understand, sick person claim cold excuse? never report employer exactly sick with. would ever enforce paid sick leave part?  Johnson Johnson work tho. That's parents got believe that, advice you. ever think go politician join executive management. non-vaccinated get sick end ER insurance, public's responsibility Ask province(state). They‚Äôre charge least school, they‚Äôre requiring students submit vaccine document; vaccine card case I‚Äôm trying get back normalcy ASAP. takes bunch us convincing friends / family fence I‚Äôm going try.

Grats vaccine :) Go Bills! trump-loving ""patriots"" could NEVER Right, makes sense. important focus fact cities US major population centers showing much lower rates vaccine hesitancy vs rural spread-out states: 


States like California there's 85%+ vaccine acceptance rate people Canada. news likes get people worry large states people them. city San Francisco people giant blue square (Wyoming) map above. hated pea-shooter. good using paintball mod wanted paint enemy completely still alive hospitalisations ICU numbers marginally better European countries though near UK, still reopening, hardly like personal decision. impacts everyone, health service full covid patients.

Maybe health systems government run, place much higher priority them. One companies wife trains giving 4 hours vacation time get vaccinated. seen official phase 3 trial data vaccine. would like read something receive it. can't transparent, definitely seems like hiding something. Also knowing Seychelles received vaccine cases rising help. Woah. like 30 days China informed WHO. politics that's actually pretty damn fast reaction coming her, especially administration *that must named* reason know GBS seeing every flu vaccine patient leaflet listed rare side effect 1:100000 range. thought vaccines risk. something different? company indicating it'll mandatory general approval. trying avoid problems now. There's high acceptance rate anyway vaccine seems, we're voluntarily reporting now, there's specific antivaxxer that's likely pushed out. We're honestly ok it; honestly great without vaccine issues. Yeah, unless absolute full lockdown + incredible tracing literally country done China, know almost 1 half year governments still figured oue. certainly agree you! mean, Biergartens open summer, like need rush. What's 2 3 weeks waiting?

Anyway... know I'll get vaccine, feeling well/sleeping well due really annoying GI system issue. Since Feb 2021 much worse. I'm going major (unrelated) changes work-wise extremely stressful, time. I'm sure exactly state body immune system wise, I'm like 20% energy compared usual. think enough empathy remember that. still apartment across town, typically say ""ok I'll stay place couple weeks then"" starts bringing risky ideas. usually backs off. Let's see happens time... people reluctant get vacainned due allergies? Waiting second pfizer shot good, like plan. They'll move goal post say FDA approved fast something else crazy. US something incentivize people get Vaccine. 
People wear masks town unless (big sign grocery store says masks required while). known active cases county people think Covid gone, people get vaccinated. 
I really know anyone gotten shot, besides parents &amp; wife's parents. 
And one work (10 people) vaccinated. infection rates still high community, breakthrough infections common. Hopefully US' cases drop like Israel UK. misinformation all. People immunocompromised encouraged get vaccine.

Another group people, medications compatible vaccines told take it.

Some people groups. change immunosuppression not, itself, contraindicate vaccination. one thing can't tell them.

I wonder many would go right back ""not getting it"" explained people one daily life would able verify vaccination status could stop wearing mask lie anyone asks it.

This seems like pretty irresponsible study. could tell everybody gets vaccinated gets go vacation Moon, bet numbers would go too. can't either. It‚Äôll take months‚Äîprobably 6 months maybe less data trials post-market surveillance already thoroughly scrutinized FDA. reason one vaccines gotten, filed, full approval full approval would trigger withdrawal EUA. would remove public access every vaccine currently using EUA, slow access development, approved modality, legal basis ‚Äúemergency use Authorization‚Äù. FDA must feel comfortable vaccination rate supply vaccines allow filing. friend like that. Works Trader Joe's, got covid twice. He's still technically immune he's full-blown stoner never anything except work sit home, car right stance basically ""if store brings someone it, I'll get I'm lazy go get it."" frustrating fella lol.  DoD probably also mandate close people still think long term safety os concern, I'd happy set something zoom something explain long term side effects really possible.

I concerns all. blood clot issue almost certainly, mind, related adenoviral vector. Historically, adenoviral vectors shown cause immune responses triggered blood clots well low platelet counts. I'm thinking issues 100% gone. damn close 100% though.

I took Pfizer (didn't get choose) months ago now. I'd personally choose 2 dose regime added exposure, think confer longer immunity. there's zero reason JnJ getters can't get booster variety want later. really sure getting downvoted bit tangential. partner pregnant woman twice, incredibly stressful process tons confusing conflicting information. best/worst part another child guidance changed find current thinking everything last time wrong, although post-birth pregnancy things us IIRC. Best wishes you. September vaccinating last willing person, majority offered vaccinations July like article stated deeply care members church, yet outbreak cases continue move forward person religious ceremonies anyhow.

Wasn't quite aware ""caring others"" equated causing mass sickness death. mean everyone forced vaccinated campus don‚Äôt know purpose masking unless personal choice so. google Apple did. It‚Äôs states public health dept implement it. have. one hundred percent going approve fast, know lot people don‚Äôt want get it‚Äôs ‚Äúnot FDA approved.‚Äù Exactly.

My husband virus Christmas new years (very mild cases), fully vaccinated march. works hospital past week 3 coworkers sent home sick confirmed suspected cases corona. Yesterday started aching badly today exhausted go in. test scheduled tomorrow, could reinfected already? coworkers probably vaccinated fully. First off, always people capable vaccinated previous bad allergic reactions vaccines well immunocompromised. herd immunity matters much - people *can't* get vaccine still protected.

Second, lot elderly people difficulty various systems make appointments may mobility issues. nice believe every elderly person child grandchild help them, that's necessarily case. Disagreed. temperature scanner entrance office building, two people diagnosed COVID fever camera leave go get tested (which turned positive). 

It obviously doesn‚Äôt catch everyone, that‚Äôs two people stopped spreading COVID around office Yeah agree it‚Äôs ridiculous close beaches allow indoor dining.

Makes sense all. mean say messaging get vaccinated nothing changes working demographics highest level hesitancy? would ever thought might happen. Gotta love government. Waive district bullying policy plague rat spawn. Don‚Äôt need wear mask sorry ass spends day suffocating stuffed locker. got 2nd shot waiting 15 minutes. excited finally done! Holy shit. Thanks man. 

I agree, anti-vax misinformed best, disingenuous worst. There's lot people know get ""that would make Biden look good"". trying get political all, gotten kinda political. know doubt long term safety well, many see booster shots continued ""control measures"" government (ü§£) keep perpetuating ""fake virus""

It's wild, wacko, nonsense land stuff. appreciate informed response. work doing, thank you. need voices reason people actual expertise field. specific, actual concern vaccines, extremely rare blood clots J&amp;J platform? yet hear serious adverse side affects caused long term complications.. verified sources, is. curious there's absolutely validity concerns.

As long term safety - there's end ""phase 4"" trial observation... people going wait that, they'll waiting while. Safety studies already done. concerning observations keep connected that's never ending.

My degree biomed eng, work biotech company actually submitting data FDA speak. Plus dissertation work actually involved single stranded RNA virus (not coronavirus family). became weirdly knowledgeable world events last year hah.  Plan vaccinate population, we're boat everyone else.

We're low triage list, basic tradeoff clubs open since last June, borders closed many months later developed countries. Pros cons. amazing level acceptance ships require vaccinations chance, even guarantee, normal port calls. holdouts give alternative stuck ship 4-6 months without time ship. Dutch gov using AZ older population (1953-1960 believe) wasted still mean younger receive vaccination faster relatively I‚Äôve fully vaxed 2 weeks now, I‚Äôm starting feel comfortable going stores places, masked, something actively avoided like, well, plague. Two tactics choose from:

Emergency authorization kind FDA approval. Safety short term efficacy proven granted. thing remaining full approval long term efficacy, really important context global pandemic; even buys year immunity need booster still good deal.

Or: dumb died COVID got hung FDA paperwork? End July, beginning August. thing *think* proposed start pandemic, corporations killed it. tried find source couldn't; someone confirm, would great.

But best recollection:

Basically, everyone started development, way knowing billion dollar investments would make amazing vaccine kind mediocre vaccine.

If harder head-to-head comparisons, company mediocre vaccine save face saying trial run differently.

And fair, even trials run exactly way, would occur different times different countries different demographics variants. would still difficult directly compare, though certainly easier universal standard - example - constitutes moderate severe symptoms. sister brother way.

This makes sense! can't claim drug coronavirus even final results clinical trials. Especially considering failure rate clinical trials COVID.

That's counting chickens eggs laid... Right now, MHRA saying first dose AZ recipients get second dose regardless age. don‚Äôt see anything changing JCVI even thinking offering alternative second doses unless second dose VITT incidence rate starts increase mixing trials show good results, would end July believe. Two Christians could go church one claim religious exemption something believe moral duty Christian.

Most ""religious"" exemptions used personal exemptions. Even count individual church's separate religion one next church claim religion.

I'm religious exemptions, sometimes think renamed ""personal exemption"". Religion catch term, blaming it, blame everything nothing time.  Correct lol Yep.

I got vaccinated, see selfish people don‚Äôt give damn. soap make difference. 

I haven‚Äôt work since March 2020. dry skin used use hand lotion multiple times day.

Now I‚Äôm home washing hands frequently, you‚Äôd think hands would drier, not. frequent hand washing gentler soap means less dry skin hands.

This one reason I‚Äôm dreading returning office. may carry soap desk bathroom do. Perhaps I'm reading wrong, new research Pfizer Moderna, looks like COVID-19 immunity last **at least** six months fully vaccinated people, **though studies ongoing**.

They've vaccinating highest amounts people ever past week. I'm mid-west yeah, that's states.

Restaurants also restrictions number people otherwise allowed open dining rooms. restrictions lifted similar many states. An[ interesting study UCLA came highlighting effectiveness different incentives getting vaccinated.

The study found 13 point overall increase willingness get vaccine respondents told need wear mask anymore vaccinated, largest increases amongst demographic groups higher levels vaccine hesitancy. get keep fucking job? time traveler March 2020?  may help better understand efficacy numbers. single percentage hear like 66% 72% 95% actually average combination several numbers. number matters protection severe illness long term that, J&amp;J rest them, Allen hesitant though :/ agree part. market incentives rather poor pandemic. Vaccines particularly profitable infectious diseases west important past. added political pressure always applied meant organisations interested field many vaccines left NGO activity (not ideal). Perhaps good example mRNA technology developed BioNtech. Obviously great vaccine tech, targeting oncology primarily COVID. 

So improve situation? address incentives removing disincentives. Companies like BioNtech could supported research grants conditions around vaccine development attached. Ensuring robust internationally agreed mechanism protecting IP allowing good return investment organisations provide expertise infrastructure (without fear confiscation) would disincentive removed. 

I really hope learn COVID find position governments, collaboration private sector, promote vaccine development far past. think done leaving one party alone. would millions extra doses vaccines patented lmao. *would* doses US banned export raw material...

Wow, sorry hear. good point, food service workers (and, example, hospital workers) likely rough say in-person office workers (not working home) due nature work higher volume hand washing required. Hope research spurs (at least) changes soap strength used. instance actually widely measure test swimming pool ‚Äúcleansing agents‚Äù used rather dumping full strength bleach calling day, did.  Researchers find water wet ""getting away it"" mean ""protecting homeland"" yes.

Before inevitable carping citizens, keep mind NZ government gave clear signal last year come home now. took chances.

As someone took chances country COVID catastrophe, I'm aware choice. I'm also aware elderly family side, infinitely glad government done.  That's going take time. Vaccine production catch then, patented not.

Except AstraZeneca, they're going catch anytime soon. There's also lot motivation get US. would've thought able bring end pandemic, get sick spread would enough, evidently not. young people ever want go nightclub get small island, they'll get vaccinated. Unfortunately we'll wait August though. idea vaccine side effects. rate dropping 2 million per day still amazing. Reportedly 80% 65+ vaccinated important illness fatality perspective.

Kids final surge, sounds like 12+ coming soon. think we're around 60% nationwide basically completely control, think close. (minus staph infection). I've digital nomad 10 years part winter eczema hands - become like sandpaper crack bleed harsh winters. mild weather skin 100% normal. Since covid, hands recovering like normally do. Lotion-ey soaps really help, 80¬∞F today knuckles still covered tiny cracks. governance meeting couple weeks ago president described (in response faculty member's question) status masks fall ""fluid evolving daily"". idea wtf actually means, I'm guessing system make decision later summer know numbers better, know ultimately it'll whatever state (read: Governor) decides do.

I may need new job can't let go. imagine NYT editor cracking whip poor suckers writing articles, insisting find something negative keep saying. literally says protection ""severe disease"" infection. still get COVID without experiencing severe disease. Religious freedom end begins affect people's lives. religious, insane enough holding church service height pandemic, even ridiculous use wear mask. feel church well, even government took action completely closed churches diocese. couple months later CDC guidelines better defined, opened something like 5-10% capacity, masks mandatory, singing, schedule service ahead time. advising people generally go televised services instead.

Unlikely supose get letter since februari Netherlands lying vaccinations, may received single letter, even investigated im indeed group supose get vaccinated early well looks like im doomed get vaccinated due ignorance. ""The CEO Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. said Thursday could cause company suspend Florida departures move ships elsewhere.""

Do it. vaccines aren‚Äôt 100% effective preventing Covid they‚Äôll keep getting sick, ending hospital dying. That‚Äôs main point. It‚Äôll never get completely eradicated. 

The way Australia treating stay locked forever guess. ""more category 5"" hurricane? simply dropped whole schtick? Heyyy‚Ä¶wait minute‚Ä¶You guts get Paid Sick Leave!! ""peOPLe FOrgE vaCcINe cArDS""

Of course people will, also happens major crime. people participate felonies, including vaccine hesitant.  friend works freighter literally saw entire cargo containers full JJ shipments (going UK). think realistic balanced, one voices reason throughout whole thing. That‚Äôs awesome! end April, really hard get vaccine young people. lot remaining people don‚Äôt want one. naively assumed would get 70% issue. Thank you! Strict lockdown since January really. Could leave 5 km house purposes work, exercise shopping, mixing households banned, everything apart supermarkets, pharmacies takeaways closed. Mask compliance high, wear outside children 13 to. already millions extra doses, would fewer dead. 

Unless claiming world vaccine hesitant first world countries. need fast track FDA approval shut ""skeptics"" (ANTI-VAXXERS, really). Remove hesitancy jabs. feel good Biden admin pushing this. Wow one sensible statements lockdowns restrictions I've seen since whole thing started.

He says restrictions removed fast applied, based data prevalence, level vaccination, tracing. also pointed officials need try keep save credibility, suggesting (rightly IMHO) losing credibility arbitrary complex restrictions.

I hope lot people see listen him. possible walk ins state. you? Maybe look around bit more? vaccine proven 100% effective preventing severe cases death. 

No one fully vaccinated died covid. got first shot yesterday, second one month. two weeks considered fully vaxxed. 

That's near end June. 
According today's covid report Mass.gov, still million doses waiting administered MA. 

That's what's changing September.

Edit: unsafe? I've personally lost coworker, great grandmother young friend virus. pretend like noticed insane amount deaths suffering. It‚Äôs wild getting anxiety past year given me. 3 weeks removed second shot saw city bar crawl end may. immediately felt like ‚Äúhow could even consider going that‚Äù eventually start things JJ unfortunately presents risk related kind blood clot, don‚Äôt see used under-40s UK (or continental Europe, matter) soon. point idiots thinking : ""If vaccine ok paying us take it?""

How much ticket mars? EUA 2 months safety efficiency data utilized declared emergency situation. 

Biologics License Application (BLA) normal approval utilizes 6 months worth data. 

You find That's quite voodoo economics guess making. virtue signalling good. lot people look organizations, including kids, emulate do. Good Bills smart man. grandpa might still alive people like him. Fear sells. FYI China outproducing US India combined fair margin moment, exporting vaccines every country world combined... Boring.

We know masks aren‚Äôt 100.000% effective don‚Äôt prevent droplets escaping. need something similar neutering. US already lifted export restrictions. 

Lower RND incentive? lol Still Pfizer would nothing regardless plant making etc  best employer tells give grace ups expectations employees. California front states handling this. Top notch (I live Arizona vacation several times throughout year 2nd house). Wish state good, state matter! article says differently. You‚Äôre covered regardless. idea discussions more. 

Also, mention rejection CTAP plan start making vaccines many facilities last year. many lives could've saved millions extra vaccines delivered already. Things actually going exceptionally well here. Many provinces open everyone 18+ within week, foregone conclusion everyone wants one first dose July 1. supply continuing increase, second doses likely done middle August September 30th previously announced.

At rate things going, we'll higher percentage people one dose US 3 weeks based University Calgary's projections. True, replying comment pharmacy US president recently directed pharmacies federal pharmacy partnership offer walk vaccinations. Serbia also lets bears drive cars. So, there‚Äôs that. good news! lockdown like? I've back forth US Spain whole thing. Currently back Spain. Spain got hard (strict lockdown, leave house food/medicine) early months. curfew everything closes earlier normal. Also, amazing see total mask compliance Madrid, compared US.

I'm happy I'm fully vaccinated can't wait EU catch up. feel guilty privileged American. problem would central database information would privacy concerns could hacked, would basically sensitive SSN unique identifier. Since started work home (last March) might 50% efficient much happier. Getting paid way less stress, albeit, get liking it. Uh oh, guess military personnel refuse take vaccine won‚Äôt choice. know religion protecting others, count out.  Full approval generally takes year EUA millions already taken it‚Äôs thought time reduced 6 months, hopefully end year.  heard JJ might divert jabs Europe (from America want them). I'm pretty excited this, anything get fluid arms. US blocking supplies make vaccines reaching India. 

Not that, Moderna pfizer rejected CTAP plan start making vaccines many facilities last year. Yeah, I'm sure see Rutgers going require (and fully support that). possible NY kind law books says vaccine must FDA approved order mandate it. also think state government hopeful get whatever number need widespread immunity combination willingness people convinced incentives etc. issue forcing comes table. Sorry know post flaired USA meant people globally Same. told everything back normal nothing masks, though assume profs wanted wear wouldn‚Äôt problem? know least one instructor transplant recipient believe would take things like account? Bases reading seem apply here. I'm sure army Pharma lawyers well aware this. Thanks Trudeau! nobody mixing western vaccine right now. Government mixing sinopharm sinovac due supply discrepancy certain regions United States yeah look health care system 

In parts India literally non existant 

FL heat humidity first world health care system. India crushing poverty already puts people risk pandemic even hits. 

You can't compare two Rounded numbers received deliveries

Pfizer 13.5M

Moderna 1.7M

AZ 5.4M

J&amp;J 272K

8M received last month, 11M expected one would wanna give out? scandals similar astra scandals? That's fundamental misunderstanding drug R&amp;D works. Big pharma large compete small biotech companies like Biontech, acquires patents enters joint ventures clinical trials, marketing, manufacturing. Hence vaccine known ""Pfizer-Biontech"".   I'm blue cross heard this, different every state. point trying make would carry lot weight AstraZeneca government organisation, rather another for-profit pharmaceutical giant right, meant sick/personal time. get days sick time use emergencies need call day. Vacation time scheduled days advance. Sorry hear mono, that's nasty virus own.

You're generally discouraged receiving vaccines mildly ill unless recommended doctor recover. Pfizer tested intervals 42 days say interval long fine second dose. Realistically, longer probably ok too, although explicitly tested. Pretty presumptuous tell best kids know anything situation. family area take care kids fall sick. I'm going send potentially sick kids taken care friends help it, would endanger someone else's family incredibly selfish.

No one arguing benefits social interaction, needs weighed potential risks Dying got 8h . made feel lot better getting second one knowing could time recover   Well no. people *do* get fevers catch Covid. something 100% effective mean all. Maybe standards way, way, way, way, way lower mine,  
They are, throughout entire time, spent days grind melting brain raves, opposed letting sensationalist pandemic rhetoric hang like sword. 

Sounds like need break internet.  Yeah also feel awful shower That‚Äôs heard today German media. heard discuss this, nationwide also EU grounds decide Horrifically sad scary. Presumably one sick normal issues like heart attacks etc get treated either. always reason needed lockdowns, overwhelm health care breaking point. much harder countries like India corrupt leaders care political rallies poor people need work eat government support. critical Osterholm critical anyone gets ahead data makes firm prognostications. don‚Äôt care prognostications negative positive, I‚Äôm attached particular outcome. think it‚Äôs best assess things based available data acknowledge uncertainty exists. Gandhi Osterholm equal offenders attached particular outcome allowing biases affect interpretation data. Same, fully vaccinated since March, done wearing mask, point wear obedience safety. You‚Äôre American you? anyone know vaccines offered Spain? article mention that. boss never million years would this. use PTO need recovery day. Apparently got vaccine barely side effects thinks employees lying say issues. also work remote right even need day home anyway. He‚Äôs real pleasure work with.  people waiting anyway, what's big freaking harm rewarding people already right thing? society pile crap can't right every single person got vaccinated? Tax Bezos. right thing. Giving people waited right thing, heaven forbid end situation again, cause problems. make insurance policy supposed Greatest Nation World?  really anything anyway. We're point additional vaccinations going drop CFR anymore, still 0.5% range Colorado. Colorado measures cases day symptom onset, fairly easy get accurate number look back time far enough. Colorado considerably younger US whole (0.65% annual mortality versus 0.85%), nationwide numbers higher. 50,000 nationwide cases daily still large number daily deaths. 

Vaccinating biggest spreaders instead highest mortality risk first gamble countries, Europe no-brainer. They're tremendously expensive lockdowns rather let cases rise, even though vaccinations preventing consequences cases - preventing cases themselves.

In world, political wealth prevent spread, vaccinating elderly letting rest population catch COVID could better option.

But again: every model assumed vaccinations prevent spread concluded vaccinating likely spread prevent deaths vaccinating elderly. Exponential growth unintuitive, easy handle math. number 100%? *cough* India *Cough* vaccines now. Man.  really hope kids 6 vaccinated fall. 

My kids 6 10. I‚Äôm betting happen year. One glazed donut day I've tried commit suicide donut. Israel hit 25% population covered 2 months US did. Two months ago Israel 20 deaths per day which, adjusted US population would around 700 per day almost exactly right now.

This rough math ton factors play, keep mind getting vaccinated gaining immunity takes weeks. exposed dying take month dying death recorded reported takes time well current vaccinations numbers going immediate impact death rate. Things looking definitely headed right direction. Tbf, people waited died.  possible share vaccine immunity via blood transfusion? vaccine require sense justice duty, cost benefit analysis personal circumstances.

That's took it. purely contribute herd immunity (and thus hopefully end restrictions sooner). honest would taken vaccine 1 1,000 chance death help that. still need actual human interaction. need friends talk person. computer doesn‚Äôt replace that.  remote learning teachers good job teaching. That's pretty good incentive. advertise more. Yeah end game Australia seems bit difficult  wonder people feel people using fake paperwork get country? usefulness India's data hoping least capturing signal trend.

And even looking trend things worrying. 30 days ago 7 day average new covid cases 93.2k 385.8k. Obviously ton underreporting trend horrific. deaths we're seeing infections several weeks ago why, even new cases peak next day so, we're likely still see increase deaths even active vaccination campaign. Thank heads Dispatch! I'm always lookout quality news source right leans right (I want well rounded) what's joke right now. Glancing site looks like fits bill perfectly. I‚Äôm aware. clear I‚Äôm talking businesses 500 employees less said needed herd immunity go back normal? look data, see vaccine 94 percent effective, look countys numbers make pretty educated guess. Biden letting Euros play bad cop role here. friend family member take you? Try health department. Mine sending nurses door-to-door unvaccinated residents homebound. That's laugh. Context
