0,2021-11-29," Exactly. Imagine loss life went ""meh"" let 'er rip.  indoors worst place be. outdoors sun much possible. hospitals start get near capacity discharge unvaccinated dump street. cancellation surgeries, need choose choose ones patriotic duty rare reasons. means ""religious exemptions "" shove it, last priority well. President Biden also announce hospitals allowed admit unvaccinated patients January 1st, give people motivation can't clog hospitals anymore, time actually face consequences actions. Nurses ICU pretty nice, maybe due Covid made feel nicer (Bicyclist hit head speeding drunk driver). thankfully nurses general do.  asymptomatic it’s breakthrough. It’s body dealing it. family got covid month scheduled get booster shot. do? I'm fucking tired covid...so fucking tired think pretty bad reaction (fever, nausea, chills, headache) took day. think 2-3 days norm (though I'm sure happens sometimes). 69%, ages, fully vaccinated. (That means maybe booster.) probably clearer. gave specific response somewhere else post.

I 2 shots Pfizer July. Boosters made available cohort, looking like soon Christmas. I'm reluctant get booster variant may well almost non-existent.

The vaccine manufacturers said could updated vaccine within 100 days, probably shipped end Feb beginning March. So, reason, I'm thinking may better wait extra 30 days, relying solely double shot July, rather getting booster designed Alpha/Delta Jan get another (if allow it) March. thinking Canada vaccine-hoarding every-man-for-himself type country, chair south African medical association, random doctor street. Israel also says thing. Thank explanation. I'm guessing implies current vaccines provide form cellular immunity? Update: DaileyMail UK (don't laugh) posted article Zero Hospitalizations Deaths SA right due Omicron variant. added usual wait 2 weeks though. dont know accurate right now. talking NYC - patently false, unless live like Sheepshead Bay Staten Island. Mask compliance indoors like 95%. Patience think media world governments would allowed propagation credible, expert analysis set reasonable goal could probably calm bit. nobody idea we're even headed goal is. Deeper cellular immunity, T-cells B-cells. Antibodies first weakest line defense relatively easy viruses trick - viruses mutating evade antibodies happens time. viruses managing evade deeper cellular immunity moderates disease severity - would make population immunologically naive - far astronomically difficult task basically never happens. blame lot good bit existence 24 hour news cycle put talking heads news networks say bunch absolute crap. Journalism journalism entertainment! literally made stuff head typed out. well get vaccinated. are, good go life. need scared. Seems that's story since beginning pandemic. Every step way CDC scientifically correct got messaging completely wrong. would nice could start learning mistakes.  Nope, hear? there's pandemic time limit. over!  Maybe has. Maybe not. Comments like aren’t helpful. Best-case scenario significantly contagious, evade immune response, outcompetes variants, causes mild symptoms, activates immune response protects variants. Basically equivalent aerosol live virus vaccine people wear masks get vaccinated choice breathe in. That's want, need coronavirus become, next common cold siimilar severity one. According CNN’s tracker, ~150 known cases omicron world today, 77 South sharp rise hospital cases SA prob due delta (not omicron). don’t know every hospitalized case attributed variant, know 77 omicron cases SA time. video Omicron uploaded medcram. Twitter doctor sensationalist news outlet article BS Compare amount lives lost, major crisis. run flu shot clinic work. work North Idaho, vaccine uptake kind great.

Last year, all-time high flu shots. 

This year, less half normal although clinic brought Covid vaccines well, single taker. 

It quite depressing. recognizing COVID never going go away overflow hospitals long term solution could work improving healthcare apparatus.

Yes take years, COVID isn’t going go away years have. Could pretty easy. lockdown vaccinated get hospital treatment get sick. Protect nurses doctors Alpha beta..alpha delta alpha etc.... Maybe Pfizer one pay nurses? LOL SA reports cases tomorrow noon eastern time, Omicron real deal better buckle another global wave. Unfortunate come this, isn’t even guarantee lacking vaccine supplies blame ends case variant originated SA. Vaccine hesitancy real villain. Moderna got 10s millions shots stockpiled, surely countries wanted shots could asking them. Seriously awful policy making, honest. foresight all. Also, mixed messaging terrible. Going back forth whether boosters needed reminds early CDC went back forth mask wearing, first saying masks useless.

Meanwhile, live country got boosters August, I'm good least February.  masking re-masking taking sips waiting food thing... I've literally never seen single person anywhere. seems ridiculously excessive. moderna bad reaction, keep mind booster half dose might make feel bad. also option get Pfizer booster, did. Could elaborate why?  yes even worse - problem can't fast track staff since takes certain amount schooling. absolutely happen, really going help right now. let rip, would unconscionable amount horrifying death, millions left crippled, smouldering crater healthcare system used be. reality could possibly led better outcome.  Unfortunately that’s illegal. hate negative cmon. shots, wear masks inside yea…

At point need decide want live exist - living. Back September looked like boosters might get rolled long time, already 6 months first round vaccines, went got second 1st shot (id insurance required). Given mess (and finding exposed couple weeks ago, stayed negative), I'm glad did. Admit it. posted there's appeal saying ""it's effective. ARR! harties. RRR, might say effective, ARR knows heart not"" understand either. say listen experts, discount news fit narrative. 

Literally, news outlets focusing variant, convinced scientists trying cover up? Laughable. China cant forever though . Thats problem. eventually let virus access population happens then. Like us face thing eventually.  I'm fully vaccinated plus booster. even masks anymore. fly gab couple grocery store leave. go straight trash leave airport. part getting vaccinated three times. I'm done shit.  read article, buy hand wave ""fizzled out"". We've known long time vaccine effectiveness declines young people too. think argument booster necessary young people largely got mild disease potential risks boosters.

The missing piece though even end mild disease, still contributes spread community especially bad large portion population refuses get vaccinated vulnerable. Another part scientists adamant countries less vaccine get first healthy people get boosters. sounds great theory really realistic. Wealthy countries always going take care citizens first. 

It obvious dragging feet boosters would eventually approved everyone. Biden admin seemed know (Biden talking boosters everyone well advance approval), FDA board originally. “A prophet honor country” see lot percentages, real numbers. cases triple 10 30? case, that's big deal, article even specify otherwise.

This article pointless due lack significant information. read article went detail. skipped nu xi cultural reasons.  I'd say 3 doses! country loves Israel, interesting see US leadership right implicitly scoffing Israel's strategy control pandemic, fight tooth nail sort mandates home. it? date word kids affected....

Now we're talking kids admitted....

P.s. allegedly omi u.s. yet .... yeah sucks can't that.....yet.

Or...can it?  Fun stuff. critical economy stored high yield, makes sense. perfect concentrated tree juice. I’ve never asked show proof vax anywhere USA restaurant cares naming time?? Media trying busybody. There’s plenty don’t think it’s helpful point. People already decided they’ll act future surges actually seen lot fear mongering news. 'scary' part know much capability.

I seen LOT ""news"", however, ""the media"" spinning scare people letting Biden lockdown country. It’s org’s, it’s structure government. US, states make policy many cases CDC make recommendations. Things lot easier smaller countries like Israel, size Maryland. UK people (66 million, they’re crammed area size Oregon. think people will. essentially stopped masking stores NYC borough low positivity rate past several months I’m fully vaccinated. Add that, wearing mask work day, I’d rather free time. start masking again! think reasonable people follow guidance. insensitive. Imagine wishing prolonged pandemic feed asocial tendencies MVP Noticing lack demand booster, got mine today preparation think bad winter none friends got original shot eager booster. ""two weeks"" would actual ability change things! Meanwhile, us introverts salivating prospect. Heah now, hope washing hands least. swiss cheese model. 70% always educated guess, original version virus. Delta changed game. Or...not admitting unvaxxed. Either backstop healthcare system somehow temporarily increasing capacity (a possibility becomes remote every day, health care workers become burnt out), let collapse, accepting six months year chaos death hurt less long run endless cycle surges. 

If we’d let Covid rip year ago, people would probably immunity now. KNOW Sunday, U.N. health agency issued statement omicron boiled to: **We don’t know much yet.** friendly reminder idea variant might totally evade immunity degree population becomes essentially immunologically naive completely implausible. There's reason flu cause catastrophic pandemic every year despite rapid rate mutation. current Australian Govt history downplaying disasters. wife sickest EVER dose two. neighbors son developed heart condition 16. longer play high level sports. 

For lot people, even ""want right thing"" incredibly worried side effects. Especially considering vast majority young healthy people unlikely even severe reaction contracting COVID begin with. 

Some people care saying. simply programed repeat ""you must, protection""  feelings see stuff toddlers impacted (&lt;2) 
I keep refreshing hoping information part science predicting exact situation though, since boosters likely help future variants? still gotta wait 6 months booster right? got second october Yeah, naming changed expectations, π likely pi day.  Doesn’t change fact is, fact, still pandemic happening. Yes, thank you. That's trying convey. Especially seems existing vaccination seems ""good enough"" people. would still want booster you’re eligible. there's large number dipshits *refuse* cover ass, lots seem forget two facts.

1. pass germs, even vaccinated. (Which masks help with.. keeping germs in.)
1. still exist great deal people cannot vaccinated yet. would great honestly. Protection severe illness would likely stay high well. 

But sucks waiting... I'm really anxious shit but...

I guess least we're better position pandemic began, even worst case. 

January 2020...

0 tests

0 masks

0 vaccines

0 treatments

0 vaccine/treatment infrastructure

0 leadership US. South Africa fuck load vaccines. Supply booster usage first world isn’t issue. 

South African severe vaccine hesitancy chronic AIDS infection making variant factories real issue.  hype Delta, Mu etc...

We're alive still. Might small step back move forward. take right precautions.  10% actually eligible? I'm one them. agree messaging awful, many us waited fit even generous criteria.  Michiganians seem take punches quite easily. looking outsider :)  Yeah, that's bit much even every neighbor elderly, obese bunch comorbidities.  bad thing. None listed states climate like Michigan. Iowa close. case, said gar vaccine distribution here. live Oakland County. wealthy suburbs like Royal Oak, Troy Birmingham vaccine rates high case numbers low. Conversely North West Oakland County vaccination rates much lower covid raging control. Oakland County overall 70 percent vaccinated, ranges 90 around 40 depending are. Canada's version federal reserve?  700 children 73 million died covid Don’t bunker harm social development something less dangerous flu (for them) won’t be. point pandemic almost voluntary. Don’t wanna get hospitalized die? Get vaccine, wanna increase chances severe prognosis? Don’t get it. adult decision let adults make it. make poor decisions, that’s them. 

It’s time stop letting unvaxxed hold hostage give politicians excuse keep using government hammer. mom retired $76-something end of, think, 27 years Kaiser Permanente. Phew 🙏 Pfizer Moderna say could tweaked version vaccine would work better omicron matter couple months so? hit 6 months couple days ago. decide get booster think I'll wait shake out. Laughable. nothing better say resort childish retort. don’t know anything hospitals NY, possible patients transferred overloaded upstate hospitals city, causing capacity issues city well? Why? can't arsed charge health reaching GP nearest clinic/supermarket/pharmacy administrating shots? understanding triage (concept/practice developed wartime) put unlikely survive bottom list. Palliative care, best. can't tie surgeons priceless time resources trying save likely can't saved. Medical Lab Scientist think quitting every day. covid testing getting hand burning everyone out, skeleton crews incentives. never said aren't. still risk going taking mask, lot factors including ventilation fun stuff make difference.

But I'm going live inside day/night long, I'm going make risk calculations. 

I got light break earlier year (late August). timing works out, got outside music festival outside.

However, double vaccinated Moderna, helped since pass anyone around never lost smell/taste. yeah, feels like truly learned nothing ""Don't use masks!"" debacle beginning pandemic. ""you need booster get one could bad reaction!"". ""maybe 8 months"". there's omnicron variant already.   argument due efficacy boosters, vaccine production stores go less developed countries (with low Vax %) prior boosters already vaccinated areas. still stands this.  understand possible? ton articles posted sub weeks ago telling people available everyone. Also health insurance(which know everyone has) sent multiple emails letting us know lost insurance paperwork issue still able make appointment Kaiser get booster even without insurance.  nuts. went upstate holidays looked vaccination, hospitalization, death rates. parents live Niagara County hospitalization rate 50 times higher Queens. Low vaccination rates, one wearing mask health department tell yet. They're sending number people hospital population like 200,000 compared 8 million. almost hospital beds going holidays. 

Masks vaccinations working us there's reason people can't it. weeks they're going another nightmare absolutely reason all. 

And course thier fault. foreigners Canadian border opened people Buffalo driving use grocery stores wear mask. Even though Buffalo better shape are! came grocery store guy saw mask said ""oh yeah, need mask Erie County."" virus stopping county border bro! tried tell people basically back normal here, wearing masks vaccine card ready show going inside. Totally inconsequential steps buying us human life. least family sort gets think they're getting boosters. holy shit glad home again! Infant mortality SA 2.5%, let's pretend 1-to-1 comparison healthy people. Buy 17 cases toilet paper, got it!  Maudit asti d'caliss. ""Don't panic"" ""take action"" compatible strategies want control every aspect citizens daily lives. Never let crisis go waste. Upvote Winnie pooh, fuck CCP, incorrect pronunciation  (if offered), happy go booster today too. think people like representative population would like think. I'm happy take vaccination I'm offered physician recommends it, takes effort people stop thinking important, they'll drop off. everybody lot people. still breathing air. sometimes leave mask know I'm hitting shops row. hassle keep taking putting back every couple minutes. forget take off. 

But yeah, experience same, shops / grocery places, people wear inside. food places eat inside bars, off. anyone even know vaccine actually anything? Probably real, protect investment since they're slowly taking continent Africa continent, South Africa country. 10 days flatten curve, again. Again.  problem 'survival', also shit like Long Covid (which still affect vaccinated folks) - need buy time figure shit out, half-ass 'close 3 months sneak around meet people whenever cry corner go Applebees' shit nobody favors.

Like... get covid, survive... still permanently disabled. taking minimally. Long Covid symptoms still kick vaccinated.

Lockdowns, needed, would protect people like me, vax'd boostered, too. protect 5s can't get vaxxed. 

And gods, hope they're needed again. really do. came back normal fast, early, going kick ass. reason doctors nurses kind events get real PTSD, small part make tragic decisions groups people equally deserving care.

I want highlight important is. I’ve read several self-posts r/Nursing, patient rants full emotional breakdowns needing peer support.

PTSD still stigmatized immensely North America, especially workplace (C)PTSD “Nurses chose job” “They knew signed for”.

Bless up, nurses docs. 🫂 Last checked lung cancer contagious. wear neck tube covers mouth prevent spread virus covers lot face Ya saw reports 90% new cases Gauteng omicron. data don’t jive. 

Two possibilities:

1) 77 omicron count South Africa wrong; lot higher, or

2) “90% new cases” wrong. pointed out, PCR test identify it’s omicron. 90% metric official source, published data back either.

Given number hospitalized cases Gauteng, it’s possible 1) 2) true ie mutually exclusive. now, I’m leaning towards 1) solid official count omicron cases. Delta raging SA seems likely variant also causing spike Gauteng hospitalizations hear battle cry? sad reality restrictions indoor mask reqs longer sustainable anymore. 

Between avoiding thousands COVID related deaths, mostly unvaxed, annually destroying livelihoods, allowing people lead normal life, nearly governments chose latter point, correct choice. major restrictions pandemic round two years must learn adapt virus. Covid ain't tired though.  real vaccine, fake-ish one? Mutations random, question something many mutations would milder disease due different lineage, recently hit mutation affected contagiousness.

None happen even likely happen. however mean virus needs reason become milder. Evolution filters selective pressure occurs even none. Moderna claims working new booster within 100 days address it. since know nearly nothing yet, I'm sure take that. Ah, capitalism. anything can't monetized? solution problems /s. Lots news came last 4 days. 

I unnerved new variant. 

1. government says: don’t panic
2. Lots governments taking action 
3. Booster galore (already got mine). seems process suddenly sped up

Sorry doom mood. something brewing.  People tired want isn’t going keep hospital. Well luckily live perfect world ever things like consequences. Moderna shots booster last Friday.

My second shot NIGHTMARE. terrified booster.

Booster breeze comparison. Don’t get wrong, still bit achy fevery, nothing like last time.

Don’t let fear stop you. Go get it. read yesterday, problem SA can't seem get people vaccinated. delay deliveries vaccines stockpiling someone needs kind vaccine outreach program get communities...  suspect vaccinated people keep taking reasonable precautions keep living lives. unvaxxed take chances likely end clogging hospitals morgues. Whatever happens virtually guarantee won’t new restrictions state probably 1/2 others. point thing burn lot people going die first. I’m starting think original estimates 1-2 million (in US) might right. Uno reverse card mandatory along! Admitted something else Omicron guess too. much omitted differing articles right now.  6 100 epitopes *in silico*! would true enough people actually got them, nowhere close that. Plus everyone age 5 can't get yet.

Lockdowns going needed manage case load prevent hospitals ICUs filling up.

For reason also seem forget even mild cases covid result long covid. Limiting cases still important reason.

Another reason limiting cases important potential new variants. Fewer cases means less covid replication less potential variation.

Especially covid becomes endemic going see regular surges need prepared flatten curve ensure resources overwhelmed. Without high enough vaccination rate strict lockdown restrictions, including masking, best proven way this. current Australian government also managed COVID best first world countries.

It mostly state governments forcing federal government along kicking screaming.

Geography always helps, too. We're lucky lot. 2 boosters Please tell lockdown US again..  brother works addidas outlet mall Minnesota. pick Black Friday least 3,000 people time alone.

My brother apparently said 2,000 transactions entire 8 hour shift. least 2,000 people came store.

Absolute insanity. Nike store across mall probably 2x many too. understand that. *dont* understand believing whatever next goal post is.

And no. amount masking locking ever going save us. People can’t seem accept never control. continue lament you’ll never get 100% *global population* something it’s physically possible doesn’t mean ever *actually* possible. long Covid circulates, chance always dangerous variant emerge. mainstream opinion epidemiologist Covid chance eradication (not diseases same), even mask bring cases now, would temporary solution cases come back relax measures. 

For reason us humans really hard time moving away mask since visual indicator disease prevention, vaccines really way go, even protection provide isn’t visible eyes, confuses brains don’t focus. problem pandemic vaccinated people choosing wear mask, it’s willfully unvaccinated (masked not), unequal distribution vaccines worldwide. America pretty well vaccination comparatively speaking, emergence Delta Omnicron come vaccinated Americans unmasking, came less well countries receiving vaccines quick enough.  10% hospitalizations SA kids! Possible someone HIV positive otherwise increased risk, they're admitting, regardless? would helpful also know average length hospital stay. Big difference overnight stay treatment vs weeks ICU. dad took pandemic seriously last year got fully vaccinated spring refusing booster friend said read somewhere everyone gets booster die within 2 years. bewildering frustrating. death, man. Long Covid. *seen* happens people catch covid SURVIVE? There's dad went breadwinner needing walker get around 32 doctors telling live see son's 5th birthday.

People get Covid survive - even go ventilator way - incredibly huge ball symptoms that, least far, permanent often disabling!

You can't say ""some people would die we'd immunity"" - people immunity could well also crippled. death rate everything. People survive vastly reduced quality life. Oh god, I’m gonna BOOOOOOOOOST!!!!  Bingo. Working hospital fun 100% capacity. Even individuals made ""life choice"" nothing.  “I’m done hurricane!” 

Says man steps outside eye storm. “I stayed inside whole hour can’t take anymore! It’s ending. avail. I’m going head outside now.”  things short wait book appointment shot #2 kiddo pharmacy. walk mass site nearby pharmacy. live largest city flyover state that’s mediocre every respect doubt experience particularly special way. experience well. spent hours HEB site trying get appointment. booster, got one day. drive 25 minutes vs 45 first one. mean, that’s perfect example cop goal. “Manageable”. mean you? Pre covid ICU utilization? Pre covid +5%? Nationwide? little pocket somewhere gets bad rest country fine? 

Here example I’d like hear. details aren’t important part, example messaging want hear. 

“The CDC’s goal Covid reduce number deaths, hospitalizations, strain health systems roughly influenza. believe mean less 40,000 people year die covid, ICU utilization remains 85%. may use positivity rates number non-serious infections extrapolate data help us project death hospitalization numbers, infection rates used determine relaxing preventative measures”. hope take care distribution too. case would corruption.. point don’t give fuck lying. They’re giving bad advice every turn. Apparently US 2 week lag time random tests spot variants. turnaround UK things isnt much quicker. maybe around couple weeks? wear mask I’m vector possible mutation.

And breakthrough cases exist. 

And keeps face warm winter. happened ur second dose?   convenient deal going around. *Smartly spent* ""easy money"" call would help economy. Getting virus control would also help economy. mutually exclusive. Companies better get last drip profit us now, much left this, except anger. means citizens mostly freedom movement since last April...I'd prefer 2 years soft lockdown Yep. Minimizing traction mutations one explicit reason given first getting people vaccinated large enough numbers. are. Oh poor ""freedom"" hoovered terrifying deep state overall hospitalization rates dropping weeks now, know ""spots"" referring to. nurses. Doctors burned also. Doc colleagues mine used say would never retire starting look retire cut back significantly I’ve worked nurse firefighter pandemic. whole situation sucked sugar coating it. (UNPOPULAR OPINION) Lots loss, feel though signed for, backing now. I’ll continue work honestly made stronger person experience invaluable. Best luck healthcare workers stay field whatever comes way next! funnily enough, 8000 years ago. far know, multiple theories whole place turned desert, nobody concrete, irrefutable evidence far. take you’re fellow Canadian?


Only Canadians ever seem bring attention fact point we’re talk action. government says much shit 24/7 international audience “way go Canada” vibe”. take absolutely zero initiative whatsoever really gives people impression get hell lot done actually do..


Our government completely inept point it’s beging get really concerning. least BC.. won't. basically optics. Yep. Cruise ships absolute petri dishes we've seen. STUCK HELL NEARLY TWO YEARS Mutated doesn’t equal “bad” travel nurses pay high rent costs short term accommodation? make difference though. people showing carry out, dining area, masked near others also masked. admittedly tiny percentage every bit counts talking exponential growth. market slows realtors saturated…. disregard them? think actually laughing ass anything insipid posts research heard may less belief science vaccine around Africa perhaps culture marketing could help. Protective sterilizing immunity same. There's high chance lost sterilizing immunity - vaccinated previously infected people likely naive people catch transmit virus. there's even stronger chance keep nearly protective immunity - ability immune system scale clear infection within days.

This would mean many antivaxers going catch Omicron Covid. Many vaccinated people too. know severity breakthroughs reinfections, potentially high rate spread places high population immunity level hospitalizations problem. deaths going among elderly - likely mostly among elderly vaccinated now, since elderly vaccinated.

Even tiny omicron-specific booster doses could dramatically help. 2 doses need see actual data shows booster preventative way. half population running around without single shot think take booster make losses every x amount months new variant pops up. seriously, WTF, everyone else saying opposite, going on? name, they're definitely taking word it. sounds right. mutations drastic, expect drop vaccine efficacy.

What get crazy amount hopium everyone seems chugging. Obviously countries mass shutting travel holidays, things good. Life always easy, several years misery outside historical norm. Wanting things back normal make so. listen rant moronic nonsense There's little masking distancing throughout country now. Serious question.

Would wearing mask increase decrease chapped lip potential. really really hate chapped lips, one hand:

The mask protects wind provides warmer environment.

On hand:

The mask would keep moisture lips possibly make chapping worse, like licking chapped lips might make feel better ultimately cause lips become chapped. approach undoubtedly palatable capacity restrictions saw earlier pandemic (unless antivax guess). highly encourage everyone watch interview, aired middle night last Thursday Cringe Michigan Target masks 10%. get texts saying coworkers covid every day. fucking joke.  270 daily cases 7 day average country almost 60 million hardly prevalent. also know percentage new cases omicron there's pretty significant sampling bias they're significantly likely sequence cases tied omicron outbreaks trash Even doctor discovered omicron variation says something panic Dammit hoping it’s everyone sick shit doesn’t want totally behind once. “But scientists I’ve talked to . . . like ‘this going good’.”

Well shit. happens if/when causes hospitals overrun much I'm reading possible? mean there's gotta point say ""OK two weeks flatten curve"" whatever, no? thought every American lawyer call - that’s seem tell everyone… It’s difficult. solution :

Stop watching cable news. 

Do get news Facebook Twitter 

Read newspapers listen NPR. Someone jump ti say newspapers bad probably example two. tell changed media diet early pandemic, worked wonders. subscribe Washington Post NYT find well sourced articles (scientists ones quoted) alarmist (while holding back bad news). public refused vaccines mask wearing, measures early would curbed pandemic Biden needs right thing put US lockdown.

COVID done you. That's good point. Even vaccinated people protected illness severe, people overall might get sick would disaster considering overwhelmed hospitals already. Hi friend, RPh/Manager picking lot shifts told experiencing burnout. 12hr days, 5pm lunch normal. Immediately used vacation hours (I used almost none Sept). Feel like now.

Last year, drinking almost every day. Hope things get better. It’s pick slack, despite feeling like need to, it’s burning us out. won’t. Biden said knows untenable. * Concentrating un-vaccinated people together called super-spreader event.
* one wants exposed COVID day, including unvaccinated. want live society infectious disease control, made possible vaccination campaigns, get jabbed themselves.
* community filled individualists tends weaker community bonds. Tangible rewards like overtime pay, punishments, maybe shared identity identifying enemy outgroup hold things together smooth interpersonal friction. Well, virus help environment. time “proves compete delta” far late anything it. It’s like watching people movie hear thump dark basement go investigate. Every movie/book/historical document ever says go ahead prevent now. always scale back later. Sit wait stupid. good chunk US. I'm wondering getting booster right now. reached six months post vax, omicron, I'm wondering wait there's shot specifically variant... immune escape, booster months it.

Thoughts? exactly thinking! plenty antivax nurses nursing assistants left jobs due vaccine mandate could staff them… rest us possibly enjoy working people need healthcare things besides unvaccinated severe covid could maybe get quality care…. I’d really like see things move direction Yeah science takes time. believe Pfizer estimated 90 days begin producing vaccine new variant. can't wish things existence... I've seen variants mutations known potentialities, barring fortuitous paradox competing mutational behavior, fear proven correct. Speaking hat, Omicron number mutations help evade current vaccines, prudent assume worst. 

Hopefully mRNA vaccines tweaked fit new genetic profile, arms within 100 days. Everyone saying thing delta. Fuckign hell man anti-vaxxers really keeping us stuck. say spike protein many mutations, they're talking sequence. necessarily mean shape changed lot, shape determines whether recognized not. Well yeah……because delta hit. Delta MUCH deadly transmissible alpha. hadn’t vaccines masks place, delta would much worse. chart misleading. text also warns that. 23rd November, added 18K positive tests backlog rapid antigen tests. caused huge spike numbers that's related situation ground.

Once numbers today, 30th, in, anomaly drop 7-day moving average, numbers realistic.

In meantime, [other include 18K backlog also show increase cases, nearly dramatic.   love people declare it’s x amount time life go back normal - it’s hilarious. It’s world, pandemics work. go doesn’t need go anymore. expiration date. federal government refused set quarantine facility. know affect people back home, fucking nightmarish many Australians living overseas economically barred returning home awful What’s discuss? know jack shit actual accuracy. TON speculation predictions limited data fuzzy priors. 

I get folks experts, they’re flying blind right too, thing we’re hearing lot “maybe possibly could be.” terms actual discussion ton navel gazing. 

We wait actual data. maybes speculation. Curious, would give current maximum possible spread virus? Possible lot South Africa’s significant outbreaks haven’t announced/sequenced new variant? Ruh roh.  Thank nothing, china desire get Covid. know vaccine prevent ending ICU, Covid still sucks ass get, hence mask usage. I’m confused. Beta mutations Delta yet Delta took Beta never spread past Africa. Africa says Omicron infections unvaccinated people. population unvaccinated, adjusted that? vaccine working Omicron? ""S gene target failure"" PCR tests run Omicron applies specific test. one commonly used one, far one. means depending type PCR test used country/region, may easy detection advantage. use bad words, please! Make months then. 

And it’s like you’ll absolutely completely vulnerable anyway. also dont evidence showing vaccines effective omicron either much booster improves immunity. 

The CDC messaging terrible here. Delta still main variant. evidence getting booster significantly improves immunity Delta. That's message pushing. would get booster protect omicron, there's evidence support **yet**. given number mutations reasonable concerned current vaccines may provide insufficient protection even booster.

Omicron reason get booster. Delta is. think discussion necessarily ""worrying"". I'm I'm curious see people saying it. too, all. hope blasé. Maybe go play Halo rest us discuss reading thinking historical event unfolding us. much longer month wide availability person also part joint vaccination committee covid response task force. It’s literally family general practitioner mouthing TV. So… little fucked, lotta fucked? omicron outcompeting delta that's solid evidence contagious unfortunately. probably different vaccination rates different races South Africa, might make impact. Also different rates language groups within race. could look up, I'm lazy so. Early 2020 world completely blindsided. vaccines, pills, treatments, etc now. 

Covid part life going forward. accept reality adjust accordingly   people's apathy vs. Delta's enthusiasm. *if* get covid first place, 100% chance. it´s (chance getting covid)\*(1 million). fully vaxxed 25 year old, sorry, I'm fine chances. interesting things note:

* patient 0 fully vaccinated
* patient 0 flew South Africa via Doha Qatar, Hong Kong. mean, yeah concern, also many mutation's thing cant attack effectively. wait see much reduction is. would guess going something around 70% effective compared baseline. Hi! sure feels like early 2020 again. think things get really bad :( I'm sure here, MI late Delta party. So, right now, probably almost Delta, baby.  kind researcher. I'm same...I want KNOW dig do. Right I'm thinking official narrative reassurance grim reality kept theoretical long possible. First! Personally, worry annual flu vaccine? even little.

Curious, feel need specify that? mean though? 20%? 30%? 

That’s super vague statement worth worrying about. doesn’t even qualify means disease immunity protection severe illness. 

What worrying accomplish know anyway? Ive read, Delta 9 mutations spike protein. Omicron 30 least. There's reason went immediately variant concern. chance hospitalization without shot still less 1%. mean dramatically. sorry? gave trying convince people. Hell, instead offered services make sure wills date. obese people can't stop obese 5 minutes. Unvaccinated people stop unvaccinated minutes. Damn cases going quickly fuck!

I hope get control soon.

That's need quarantine travelers least days; pretend infected leaving plane we're sure clean. Exactly, apparently qualify booster September get one there's new variant vaccine may may provide protection that's want get booster? evidence much help, benefit exceeds risk me? 👍🏻 Tories probably want fail. Would justification need completely gut sell pieces private firms. Totally agree. I've telling people got booster soon could (I'm pregnant wanted extra protection oh bad), I've getting ""where get it?,"" ""are even eligible?"" grandma said friend got bad reaction want get even though first two. NOOOOO, ABUELA! 🤦🏽‍♀️  GREAT lot those. keep seeing people mention covid likely u.s. earlier Feb 2020. anyone concrete info anecdotes?

I caught mild cold Dec 2019, prevailing symptoms losing sense smell point couldn’t stand coffee anymore autoimmune rash doctors never could identify lasted month January. symptoms match much covid, timing doesn’t. However, coworkers traveled state November “conference season”.

I’ve always curious especially photos rash associated covid, it’s identical mystery rash month. Except believed originated SA Botswana. SA researchers first find disclose traced back Botswana already. Covid good bad, I'd risk vaccine reduces 30 % long term effects 6 %, I'd stupid. tat's worst.

I'd probably average danger, maybe 10 ‰ death w/o, 2 ‰ vaccines. Measles 0.2 ‰ chance death, Germany that's considered high risk it. I'm hopeful doom actually happen. Mostly excuse stay remote longer one jobs. 

OTOH, expect things get worse would gotten without new variant, much unless get high-transmission version omicron. Likely time get that, probably variant specific vaccines, really problem Delta up-to date vaccination point. 15-20 million deaths, standard thinking something doom higher... even causes extra 3 million deaths 6 months Delta would have, would seem like covid news usual... would add ramp started beginning October. See previous Friday posts number that. Exactly, honestly messaging terrible here. Apparently qualify booster September get one there's new variant vaccine **may may not** provide protection that's want get booster? evidence much help, benefit exceeds risk me? 👍🏻  Force everyone keep getting boosters every months perpetuity?

/r/NoNewNormal trying warn everybody, MONTHS AGO, exact thing would happen. called ""conspiracy theorists"" saying exactly comment says, there'd endless parade variants booster shots That's good point. So, again, like back April, Michigan?

I tell rural counties pretty covid-naive til last spring bc ""lockdown"" measures place til then. believe sheer complacency getting shots play role. People knowing someone bad things happen covid.

Also, black urban population Detroit woefully undervaxxed, laid doorsteps rural folk. urban areas (composed many races) seeing skyrocket too. Well no, cause apparently may looking like less severe disease well. people infected, less severe all. still worse hospitals depending numbers line up. say, ask barber need haircut Vaccination political unfortunately going forward. point seeing us getting Covid using vaccination, taking slow many people continue resist even getting 1 dose. Nowhere say travel bans ineffective.

It say travel bans African nations wrong virus already detected regions.

And that, totally agree. ban least put travelers quarantine every country cases.

In fact, think best simply put travelers plane quarantine across globe. know Omicron far? 
Is something serious? affect already infected vaccinated? cause widespread change normal life like Delta did? TIL, thanks! presumed invaded meant virus, societies/geopoli.

The virus done me. realize governments scientific advisors. educated guesses made scientists, many unknowns. 

Yes.

For example, particular risk someone received 2

What's general idea around using different vaccines?  first messaging two weeks flatten curved turned year half. People it.  God that’s bad  many mg take Doc? need lockdowns. Worst case think mask mandates. Assuming vaccines still effective variant tragic thing daughter longer father.... prevent (bad) infections quite easily vaccinating people, wearing masks enclosed public areas allowing unvaxxed people wild 200k+ people concerts super spreader events. government chosen things thus overrun hospitals burnt health care workers whole society decided laws mandates common decency don’t apply them. results already seeing medical care staff opting people forming flash mobs rob stores - enough people decide break law authorities literally nothing. It’s tragic didn’t get vaccine minimum bar competence. job work immunocompromised people 90 year olds day, get vaccinated that's unbelievable. dangerous. Yeah ok. guy profits manufacturing vaccine also person that's telling one got struggle. No, impact ability get omicron booster.

Nothing vaccine left active week. fat, mRNA, salt pinch sugar. body degrades rapidly. What's upside saying one product might work? Good. Let's learn lesson *once* vaccinations expectation going forward. evading vaccines thing one bit check off.

No, that's selection bias. gotta announce it, first, gotta first, gotta get first, gotta make news first *rainman*.... problem increasing healthcare capacity slow, multi-year process. Limited resources levels healthcare almost always staffing rarely literal beds physical spaces. 

On top that, never going get healthcare point weather pandemic without restrictions. would require staffing ICUs 200+% capacity, never going survive long either public private system (in public system, juicy target opposing parties talk wasteful government power is, private system, lol idea private business paying double staff costs case another pandemic happens). Sure. wonder travel restrictions attenuate spread given presence already. determined current sequence covered delta adequately enough. hope larger spacing time initial series booster lead longer lasting immunity titer levels high enough still keep Delta infections low.

Now testing done lab see omicron behave similarly, they'll need change sequence. Lol it’s low 36 Brooklyn right now. 

But yeah 55 “cold” you’re used 85, isn’t planet Wait learn flu vaccine probably did. whole population needed period tasting normal world bit. like covid safe ticket thing stayed long time.

Even Omicron causes sniffles, still considered dangerous don’t know long Covid statistics like it. I’ve chronic fatigue syndrome 20 years say confidence post-viral fatiguing illnesses nothing f around with. leave pretty seriously disabled. don’t know yet long haulers going recover.

Yeah I'd interested know one-dose part 13% considered vaccinated. news already good, it'd even better so. 43% received J&amp;J single dose vaccination South Africa, necessarily, overall vaccination rate 30%.  Yes, could train wreck. not. US UK going ban travel Netherlands well?

Of course won’t. proof travel bans stupid, ineffective political.  increasing China's influence region saving lives i'm sure. know current vaccines effective Omikron? seem missed publication study results... 100% agree effectiveness many travel restrictions, including entry quarantines, testing, contact tracing. things always known work. others advocating last decades. 

What discussing earlier country/region specific travel bans like we're seeing southern Africa. measures, banning direct flights countries, effective harm good. Particularly comes disease surveillance contact tracing, disease identification. incentivize countries individuals hide information, like individuals travelled new diseases/variants identified national governments, undercut surveillance tracing measures. I'm sure that's right. According [SA government (see page 12) Gauteng 31% fully vaccinated compared 35% SA whole. There's free way reduce hospitalisation 2/3rd many people people selfish it. Got smallpox SRP, moved next table Anthrax. said optional, passed one. I’d heard horror stories old batches 90’s didn’t want deal ship out, even though point think using different formula didn’t issues. lot guys got full series, could sell blood like 3x normal amount. great source cash Class Six fund. WOULD 10 times Pfizer liberated patent. Norms different, little enforcement. social life beginning heal get semblance normalcy.... point want move middle nowhere live hermit woods. Specially Pfizer care third world people, like country (Argentina) die. pills go US, maybe Europe.  People learn course stupid! seem right according SA govt. dashboard. Gauteng 38% fully vaccinated, compared 41% country better astra one chinese vaccines nothing pee table. Unknown point. broke couple hours ago, NHK usually pretty private personal details.

I'm sure relevant, might release vaccination status. few. liberate patent already....  people either one shot mRNA one shot Johson &amp; Johnson. majority fully vaccinated. agree, think reality we're going pay unvaccinated like Austria did. first restrictions unvaccinated, quickly changed everyone locked down. I'm assuming difficulty enforcing unvaccinated.  problem fields thankless fields. healthcare industry massive visible it’s hard ignore. education/teaching field similar, except subs paid less bonuses none existent. There’s several fields job thankless amazingly find money give yearly bonuses CEO.   100% correct, think national mood longer matters.

And good reason. New information dictates new measures, ALWAYS holdouts ALWAYS reset progress. I'd love vaccine mandate adults US despite desire know way legal. strongly incentivize people get vaccines (negative positive incentives). 

But even did, world revolve around us others elsewhere world put us situation. Vaccination realistic countermeasure it, accept society world dangerous place, little dangerous today couple years ago. Covid vaccines become annual like flu shot, go back business.

This cycle cannot perpetual, fear we're heading direction. many years living worth trading fear death?  Yes internet news channels spreading misinformation.  

Catch 22 
 
While saying somewhat true, three times many people travel UK SA. ""The life stupid death John Eyers"" ftfy can't find comment find sourced articles/news. think may lack humidity well. Perhaps one intermediates got away come? 
  
Perhaps initial mutation made virus less likely spread hosts, become undone later? 
  
Perhaps mutations happened single generic mixup incident? 
  
Perhaps intermediates got away, never spread far game luck? 
  
We know mean also helped got vaccinated wore masks… whole believing science thing really took W versus praying taking horse dewormer. suspended electives 2 hospitals Capital Region, NY, hospital capacity mostly 90%. vaccination rate much lower NYC. big difference masking inside, public vaccination requirements restaurants like. DAE feel governments bluffing... waiting carnage drive political fucking anything stop this, know people can't see tangible benefits constraints (aka people getting suck dying)? time math, 25% vaccination rate, 13% hospitalizations vaccinated sounds bad me.  Well sure you’re aware applied smokers. can’t smoke indoors restaurants, bars, events states/countries. nasty habit effect others health. Crazy works, right? really, even tiny sample size still significantly lower percentage vaccinated hospital. Another hospital reported 65% unvaccinated ~30% one dose.

Right cancer immediate treatment could live another 15 years without treatment likely live 5? good chance getting treatment 5 year lifespan lower triage list unvaxxed dipshit needing modern medicine reject.  choose ignorance I'm talking cohort older folks suffered long term non-local inflammation, joint pain, fatigue, etc. That's probably half adults 60+ family. Temperature screenings almost worthless. Fever even top 5 symptoms partially/fully vaccinated individuals, even unvaccinated individuals, transmissibility correlated fever, someone fever could transmitting it, someone fever may transmissible, depending they're course disease. Temp checks another bottleneck already stressful, likely understaffed, airport screening procedure real benefit.  follow constitution. hope. mandates. none. Morphine takes care fine. ah understood!

How would know? friends invited party. also increasing capacities?

Best example recent restrictions: 3G public transport work. really seems like politicians really worrying pressure releasing new set restrictions. 

Providing testing capacities unvaccinated suddenly get tested every day? Nah. Providing vaccination capacities unvaccinated (or general LMFAO) want get vaccinated new restrictions? Nah.

Those plans talks while, something could've well prepared, instead seems like finished necessary papers evening session, patted back went home, leaving mess clean volunteers. 

For example, GP NO, absolutely ZERO free appointments ANYTHING next 2 months. 1 hour morning acute cases, that's it. Nearly taken appointments vaccinations. 

Next example, couple places city vaccinated without appointment, example GP. GF, couple months sick (not covid), wanted finally get first dose, getting go sign GP (that vaccinate also different state moved recently). went one places, 2 hours opened waited line 7, E V E N, hours opened (so 9 hours total). finally left 2 hours closing! still ton people behing line, probably go home without getting vaccine.

Finally, GF comes countryside doctors even less good ones (ones deny importance vaccines example...) GP free appointments well, even get enough doses vaccine really.

I fucking clue nobody talking infuriates end. lucky enough finally gonna get second dose (with appointment, thank god) Dec 13th bit trouble myself, though related current politics. 

Seemingly everyone talking ""people need get vaccinated"" idea hard right now. mention fact everyone also seems ignore getting vaccinated takes time. getting dose boom, vaccinated. personally wait 3 weeks first appointment, wait 4 weeks second appointment (which coming up) wait 2 weeks second dose even considered vaccinated.

AND YES, people opportunity get vaccinated earlier maybe foolishly use that, really need antagonise now, talk shit (unvaccinated deserve die get ICU treatment) maybe even radicalise anti-vaxxers protesters rioters? Keep mind, say, unvaccinated deserve die like, partly talking people awaiting second dose, trying best, maybe waited bit long. people deserve die? opinion, guess... anybody comes ""but consider vaccinated"", unless state otherwise, government definion goes.

As far accessing shops like concerned, problem considered unvaccinated, that's good, far people talking unvaccinated concerned, throw everyone pot. People waiting appointments, people waiting second dose kick full effect, people waiting 10 hours line get vaccinated sent home. pisses people get thrown pot covid deniers, anti-vaxxers like.

In case care situation going on, Leipzig, Germany... yes, ashamed getting vaccinated, mistakes made going try make getting booster soon eligible. going make mistakes again. part I'm worried wait periods. sure existed? increase effectiveness/not wasteful, makes sense. sure vaccines take well administered within 6 months something like that. Thanks saving click people South American countries trust vaccines. know Mexico Central American counties  likely it’s already there. got booster didn’t REALLY qualify. pharmacist didn’t ask got shot. people uncomfortable pushing limits guidelines. makes mad cdc sucks bad messaging. Well understand, even without booster, pretty good protection still, right? 

So question odds. know right decision is. I'm trying learn. get booster, delay long could get Omicron vaccine? so, bigger risk, given protection Delta still, potentially lot less Omicron. 


That's thought process. Trying learn things though, cause honestly know answers. best dude.   would racist. like flu?  time! I'm sure could done executive order US, way past time start excluding willingly unvaccinated allowed public. Complicated. Interstate commerce may apply, FAA regulates flights funding. air travel probably enough authority. 

There might enough Federal highways well, nothing else. give least chance family side ease that. go peacefully sleep. Overwhelmed hospital systems cannot treat heart attacks, car accidents cancers actually seems worse idk. Natural immunity doesn’t mean can’t reinfected Covid isn’t magic way disruption lives economies pandemic sound like ultimate Karens indeed. bloody tested positive. think biggest mistake letting leave first place airport - sorted legally moment plane landed. really. keep us safe  Thus making travel bans useless always thought. time new variant discovered wild long enough started spreading small chance containment. Variants don’t “come from” vaccinated unvaccinated people. Variants come random mutations virus happen make able reproduce. 

That said, since evidence strongly suggests virus reproduces spreads mor easily among unvaccinated people, best way reduce frequency new variants vaccinate people. 

It’s fair blame unvaccinated people this, though - plenty people still haven’t opportunity vaccinated, afraid vaccinated misinformation floating around. 

It doesn’t really make sense blame *anyone* natural function RNA recombination. smiled,it's bold think concerning thing spreading least two weeks completely unaware. Whatever airport went definitely everywhere point. debilitating

I mean that's probably pretty relative know stronger symptoms vaccine better immune response provoked protected. glad hit hard 2nd 3rd dose(1st sore arm) chills feverish mild headache feeling day nothing crazy. yea bad feeling boosters even among converted hopefully omicron delta's current 4th wave scaring straight knows. like idea considering anyone vaccinated 6months 2nd dose basically treat totally unvaxxed 6 months. researchers know

Very don't

A lot. Yea, I’m triple vaccinated rubs wrong way reason. appreciate sense humor. I've dodged COVID (so far) got pneumonia 2019 damn near killed me. ""lost"" sense taste loss much change. sense remained bitter, tastes radically offsetting awful. eight months, lost 25 lbs. eating chore pleasure, everything tasted like shit me. taster slowly improved year weight!

I relate long-haulers suffered form taste dilemma. know certain diet pill emulating experience would successful! Also worth considering since one four people SA fully vaccinated, means 75% people unvaccinated going much higher chance getting sick general, therefore increasing community spread inevitably include vaccinated. It’s akin US, high number breakthroughs occurred majority unvaccinated states/counties - vaccinated *much* higher chance exposed someone covid positive places high vaccination low positivity rate. 

This need lower community spread widespread vaccination NPIs; otherwise, yes, vaccinated higher risk breakthroughs they’re surrounded chances get infected. 

I personally curious see Omicron place like Israel, 62% population fully vaccinated 62%, 44% boosted. That’s still greatest vaccination rate need 80-90% reach “herd immunity”, certainly would give us lot information breakthroughs highly vaccinated population. Granted, highly vaccinated populations higher *percentage* breakthroughs (ie cases 100% vaccinated area breakthrough cases), I’d imagine statistic watch would overall rate infection positivity rate. booster 50 µg.

The full dosage original Moderna shots 100 µg. Trump still POTUS would vaccine mandates hear peep ""muh freedomz"" Republicans. Since false negatives common false positives, quite large chance woman actually positive. antigen test taken, much likely cause false negative, explain discrepancy results. 

Everyone deserves treated well, act like testing positive reckless, say least. lack understanding relative risk crazy. get today minimizing risk. rural UK. Although share idiots, people getting irritated slow rollout boosters, opened going well. Gauteng outbreak far advanced related origin CEO Moderna released new information. Omicron variant known days now. release new data vaccine efficacy Omicron. say everything ok. might not. point people wait react hard data, soon. evil 24-hour news cycle. Every news breaking. need get something even mostly fluff regurgitated ideas. Might well ban travel entirely point.

South African agree you. terms expats people much likely go English countries I've heard NL lovely, think high people's list tourism. know, going sound like conspiracy theory, trouble trusting guy 95% profits come governments buying product. 

Let’s see things play out. Myocardosis fades lingering effect whatsoever I've heard. am, least point, lot social pressure wear masks. People feel like since vaccines, over. got booster went back wearing masks public, since fully vaccinated, didn't. 25% people area (a state South) wearing masks right now, think lot probably proud choice, trying stand out. I'm sure different live big city. felt like feel back last year vaccines came out. Thank you. Biden also go ahead actually wave patent protections vaccine production could wide open world. \*South**ern** Africa Among current vaccines Moderna, Pfizer, Janssen, might effective spike mutations Omicron? admissions soley Covid? variant? long stays? otherwords, would like know many unvaccinated admitted Omicron long there? treating Omicrons? I’ve flown non stop pandemic think saw temp screening once. Following science don’t think really anything. people spread virus symptoms. 52 countries, I've lot, I've never passport stamped. Started Reagan administration, quite possibly would That's good! walk-in I'm at, I'm rural area less interest vaccine. absolutely developed Delta-enhanced vaccines. Biontech currently Phase II human trials. Must tiring write articles day new info saying doubt you, could explain image shows used them? wouldnt surprise me. Disagree. Frequently browsing FAZ, Spiegel NDR see general numbers. Even Corona data platforms don’t present high level information/filters. trying ignore information general public actively looking therefore needs communicated much broader approach. one idiots, not. good logic realize unvaccinated folks care protecting healthcare system. Vaccinated people much offset selfishness everyone else.

To me, messaging ""if healthcare gets overwhelmed non-vaccinated people get turned away"". matter happens not, rather start pushing what-if fear. yet see single public health expert epidemiologist support travel bans. seen published study favor them?  course was.    possibility lockdowns, partial vaccines, avoid spread measures made covid worse? let thing rip initially, accepted force nature, accepted fact people die sometimes can't control everything. 

Possibly we'd built natural immunity much quicker, virus would run real estate. real question whether human need feel control actually made things much worse. South African get get from,. People much likely travel UK Australia New Zealand, Germany even think South Africans would even consider place immigration ahead those. far I'm aware vast majority flights go UAE stop over.  Yeah, I'm disagreeing that, think legality healthcare allows it. know, saying, Singapore marketing machine anything, take stuff pinch salt. Well done Canada!

Mutations random, variants higher transmissibility survive. generally thought variant mutated one host, example immunocompromised individual manage clear virus long time. words, virus accumulated mutations host, allowed fight host's immune system treatment may applied. result virus replicates transmits better. can't see reason become milder. gladly wear bulletproof vests survive bullet hits want immune system.

I'm really trying prevent getting future quoting situation (eg, said totally wrong since we're still trying figure out). census opinion (of course within 4 days genome published gisaid), seems like T-cell response may still intact.

It's really early know anything approaching close certainty, far vaccines seem still efficacious would 100% support anyone get 2nd/3rd shot since rapidly evolving situation. sound like troll. anyone else reading, triple-vaccinated people symptomatic Omicron. clear proof vaccines aren’t providing sterilizing immunity variant. I’m concerned long COVID damage “mild” cases. unvaccinated people allowed restaurants bars then? finite number vaccines produced every day. supply greatly outpaced demand need prioritize one other. that's case. even were, unless distribution equitable problems would persist.  dad two 7… 😥 would've already 5 times probably situation good. developed nations need more.

It's responsibility alone. prove exactly ? Hiding information worse later comes out. totally ineffective, they’re preventing infection anymore don’t want even “mild” COVID. waiting period updated vaccine isn’t fun.

Thank god capitalism wanted protect health care systems would encourage/force people get vaccinated instead trying put blame actions vaccinated. Italy that. work use public long transport vaccinated PCR/rapid test negative. vaccinated people enter entertainment venues (stadiums, pubs, cinemas on), means unvaxed negative test still can't enter. Enforcing bit nightmare least law Still, ventilation way better restaurant bar world, masks also worn. everyone needs it, risk... mind mask mandates public transport etc. (it's probably good idea avoid stuff like flu anyway)

But gym incredibly annoying. summer almost unbearable (it hits 35C here..)

The unvaccinated chosen fate. Seeing healthcare workers losing humanity something something sinister wish people realize it.

I cannot imagine mindset patient who's actively refusing help that, threatening others spitting healthcare workers.

It seems like fever dream something. mention, metaphysically looking outside window, (tv, media,)and seeing protests you, much despise everything that's trying save them.

It fucking surreal. Ya vaccines totally ineffective variant. /s awful surveillance, testing/isolating arrival abroad recommended.

Driving Michigan felt like escape horror movie, them, felt totally normal.  said assumed natural immunity constant exposure. Here's decent article outlining argument decent sources comment saved year ago discussing travel bans. never recommended travel bans every previous pandemic, including coronavirus pandemic. done evidence continues show ineffective. 

Since 2009, declared six Public Health Emergencies International Concern (2009 swine flu, 2014 polio, 2014 Ebola, 2016 Zika, 2018–20 Kivu Ebola 2019–20 COVID-19), specifically advised implementing travel trade bans containment measure.

2009: Travel bans work. travel imposing travel restrictions would little effect stopping virus spreading

2010: Travel bans work. following measures advised, proven ineffective, costly counter-productive: ... restrictions travel trade

2014: Travel bans work. bans detrimental ineffective.

2020: Travel bans work. consistent recommendations.

Travel bans delay initial outbreak, neither overall number cases peak number hospitalizations actually decreased. Furthermore, border restrictions extremely effective (99% more) win 2-3 weeks time — restrictions are, let's say, 80% effective, pretty much anything all.

We find border restrictions and/or internal travel restrictions unlikely delay spread 2–3 weeks unless 99% restrictions would make extremely limited contribution policy rapid containment influenza source first emergence pandemic think lab studies vaccine manufacturers conducting Omicron yield information latter.  booster mainly current Delta variant I’m vaccinated, much new shut coddle un-vaxxed

I think get lower priority care stage compared medical needs

However hospitals remain huge strains 

My father-law heart attack weekend hard time getting regular bed, let alone bed cardiac floor 

22hr wait ER procedure said would move cardiac floor - - another 12 hrs later gets bed there
He telling us hospital capacity ER big back least 20 people - - post holiday rush much covid related? Hard say- never seen full  We've really bad air California number years due fires. got brave enough 2019 wear N95 outside sky red smoke, people still looked like freak.

I'm glad masks semi normalized like places world decades. know take much time develop vaccine target specific variant? remember last year around time heard Delta, Pfizer Moderna said would take 2-3 months develop vaccine become global thing (which happen) yet, still got nothing yet, im holding hope omicron vaccine done even year  go Fandango &amp; look opening weekend seating Spider-Man Way Home &amp; see people concerned. considering theaters mask vaccination-proof mandate, people stopped caring &amp; we're going spread delta omicron dominates.  speculate? There’s plenty research documented evidence could cite comparing vaccine efficacy.  Delta still exists….

Sigh, guess logic isn’t going magically reappear it? guess read simplified Chinese, otherwise find link yourself. type ""2021百家姓排名"" Google.

By way, source yours? IMHO prime example problem is. People information fill hole opinions masked ""facts"", e.g. ""no mentioning share..."".

No offense you. information presented current meta social networks include proper manual research checking everything one saying. trust information issue. 

Politicians understand this. play game meta youth wonder losing. Reuter's article paywalled. Here's [non-paywalled version Here's additional context:

* Pfizer's antiviral treatment claims risk reduction 89%.

Right on, brother! Let's vaccinate get sick die COVID. vaccinate risk.

Fucking spot on! glad seen light want vaccinate everyone. should’ve added positives: covid research really fulfilling immediate impact unlike basic research. international research community also way collaborative even greedy publishers made covid articles open-access make accessible public.   Read article, voluntary circumcision help prevent spread HIV, male genital mutilation children. One two much visible (the reason everyone put worthless plexiglass).  also based mutations have, mutations affected variants (such beta, mu, etc), specific mutations would interfere major classes antibodies, etc. definitely based number mutations. OTOH, protein folding protein interactions complex. small number well studied mutations may allow reasonable predictions, larger number changes honest answer going include ""we'll wait see giving specifics"" China probably hardest place go since pandemic. Even Chinese nationals living abroad decided going back visit relatives due mandatory 4-week quarantine hotel home. 
That’s would say going grain implementing travel ban true, given OG covid killed pretty many got first. Yes must taken seriously, media riding hard this. like delta+ etc. Source? Anyone mutilating child. I’m circumcision help prevent transmission diseases, penis owner’s decision that. that's literally said. Vaxxed people mild symptoms. That's whole point. get covid sick couple days instead weeks That’s they’re taking comes. one knows handle pandemic. try best learn mistakes (unfortunately). I’ve seen several rags protesting new proposed lockdowns, almost trying convince people afraid new lockdowns — haven’t proposed.   Easier sell 12+ age bracket covers currently high 80s (5-11 approved required vaxxed order)

Could chicken egg situation though, I'm sure vaccine hesitant people got vaccine save precious Xmas holiday Quite opposite different reactions Pfizer Modernas statements us eye roll worthy. Apparently everything rational dismissing virus damaging credibility. Vaccine skeptics point headlines like saying covid isn’t bad Modena center... Hosted Jimmy question, opportunity get vaccinated, already know prior infection plus vaccination works better prior infection alone?

Do way un-infect people past vaccinate today? No? it’s really pointless comparison. 10yr old got second shot yesterday. got happy meal Roblox $$. Perhaps type incentive folks ; ) I'm guessing complaints peanut butter 'vax' even though still took it.

You see complaints ranging “you said two weeks” “you said vaccinated” “politicians aren’t wearing masks picture.” anything, noncompliance part others increase propensity take additional precautions rather lower it. 

However irrational is, though, we’ve seen enough times people public eye need take account secondary, bad look effect. still means justification ignore mask mandate, would hoped people would realized radicals interest curbing infection rates would exploit sort thing.  Good? read article? voluntary procedure reduce spread HIV, male genital mutilation.  also people believe shit movies. imagine protagonists lifetime movie. They'll never catch COVID special. unvaccinated COVID positive person posing unequivocally higher risk? still transmit virus, albeit perhaps lower rate vaccinated, way keep COVID planes know someone doesn’t it. Therefore, covid negative unvaccinated person barred air travel? 

I’ll take downvotes really trustworthy - person integrity intellect well wife. stuck all-or-nothing thinking?

Why eat food today won’t prevent hungry tomorrow? give ice cream too. “Do know physical toll 3 vasectomies man?” Lmao need certainty, lockdown provides none that.

There new variant know little about; certainty anyone claiming provide lying. saying people need lied think need reevaluate looks like moving forward, basis authoritarian government, democracy.

Lockdowns actually thing provide certainty terms protection virus. cannot catch virus exposed. Lockdowns also refer wide range restrictions every lockdown same. lockdowns US still allowed wide range activity including going places exercise takeout pays salaries lockdown? 

The government should, form unemployment. Far much government aid (in US) went support large businesses instead people needed it; easy fix probably implemented corruption. inflation due monetary policies benefit large corporations due unemployment stimulus also conveniently ignore mental health issues; equally important physical health.

I don't, mention lockdown restrictions imposed thus far (at least US) actually restrictive. one needs dine inside restaurant mental health. one needs go bar mental health. one needs walk aisles shopping mental health. many things easily temporarily disband completely unnecessary, still make large portion potential community spread. large portion workforce (not everyone) also work home also drastically cuts potential community spread.

It's I'm talking purely scientific standpoint, bunch common sense restrictions put place surges avoid filling hospitals. hospitals fill people die; unvaccinated people covid, vaccinated people health conditions. Quite frankly arguing cancer patients people need urgent medical care die NEED dine inside restaurant shop store, terrible human being.

The better people following lockdown restrictions less strict shorter duration be. stopping covid, know that's possible, making sure overrun hospitals many thousands people die things could easily prevented willing little socially responsible.  seem like many people panic.

Governments jumping straight travel bans despite overwhelming evidence supported science especially virus already proven spread globally definitely form panic. I've lived entire life hes 75% right Perhaps wrote random bashing media, bashing posting nonsense...

Maybe ""nonsense"" referencing statements Moderna BioTech, would be... asking founders OPINION this?

I ask opinion. ask your's either, ask mine. bare minimum, label types articles like major news outlets least know they're interview/opinion piece.

From THIRD paragraph *""Dr. Sahin said interview Tuesday""*

Responsibility lies reader too. driving 12 hours see family Christmas. Husband boosters kids got second dose thanksgiving. still don’t feel comfortable flying. Enclosed space circulated air people don’t know put mask won’t get vaxxed, thanks. Lockdowns happen hospitals inundated. Plus, people understand exactly burnt healthcare workers are. ready quit.

The best thing happen insurance companies telling people longer cover unvaxxed people. Honestly, though? could instead spend time better explaining **current** situation around boosters, pretty confused general public.

Simply re-posting self-serving speculative statements two CEOs headlines not, fact, make anyone informed state COVID vaccines. K L N E R E N COVID marathon, sprint. Many states longer update published statistics weekends; update weekly.

And last Thursday Thanksgiving.  Every government office absolutely essential closed Thursday closed Friday, too, yesterday's reporting would nominally cover changes 5-day interval many states; next Friday might two weeks worth reporting states reporting weekly. trips first week arriving basic training, weeks deployed, first weeks deployed get vaccines. shit ton years enlisted Army. Hell anthrax vaccine ended getting 5 rounds 1.5 years yearly boosters discharged. cannot imagine people would feel getting choice getting smallpox vaccine cause blindness accidentally touch site eyes (this vaccine received actually worried totally scratch pick things sleep). Man, bright future writing copy charities' fundraising adverts.   Choose factual basis stories instead serving echo chamber? single intervention perfect *completely* preventing spread, [it best use multi-layered 

The risk level approaches zero add additional layers security. 

Vaccines + testing + masks + social distancing (where applicable) + improved ventilation (where applicable). 

In addition, *type* testing matters. Antigen tests significantly higher failure rate PCR. hope one wakeup calls drive us actually come together embrace follow strategy eradicate C19. hanging us constantly could end generations. Sounds like based ""expert opinion"" rather analysis actual data omicron. outcompetition (is even word?) would take consideration wouldn’t it? I've got medium quality cloth masks, largely avoid going besides groceries, stay away clusters, get minimal meandering.

I spent 13 months house last year, got vaccinated soon able, booster'ed. question prior infection protection vs vaccination protection.

It’s really *not*. It’s question prior infection plus vaccination vs prior infection alone. vaccination drastically decreases risk covid. Masks decrease still further. exactly ""info"", though it, fairly baseless meaningless speculation really bearing actual impact Omicron weeks months. Ah yes please tell research epidemiogists/physicians/research staff fear mongering. completely forgot visited shop earlier. see anyone else wearing mask either. think hard get people habit again. Quicker pandemic though shocked Russia, months ago, seemed making vaccines almost obligatory. never imagined countries would go further. saying good bad, astonished attitudes change

For reason hard judge people say right. victims times circumstance Good, hope rest countries follow suit.   patients small sample size. know contagious, still know lethal is. Moderna CEO knows product, said media morning... cited scientists Shot? Really? Yes different countries use different words things. CEOs absolutely impartial observers. I'm making point superficially contradictory statements might confusing little interpretation (in fact, saying could good example interpretation). Okay mutations get clicks? Thats important here. doesn’t really bother me. rest world fine treating introverts second class citizens, watching people squirm can’t go party friday night funny me. Q493K/H listed one mutations help jump mice. sure whether mutations would mean another animal needs added possible host category not. open everyone gets boosted effective treatments Lock downs helping hospitals overrun. things get bad, lockdown least worries. Oooooh like “cases ascending deaths descending” comparison slide. 


Thanks sharing info found things use take hours response taking days - sometimes one gets back all. organization publishes org chart phone/email lookup, finally started emailing supervisors/department heads get response 2 - 3 days something suppose day level service. usually get immediate follow-up.

And company one winners pandemic - industry flourished taken share competitors.

The real problem coming getting saddled disproportionate amount work (my industry, although white collar tasks must done physically) getting burned out. increase South Africa last year around December / January mainly driven “Matric Rages”. Essentially large gatherings teenagers completed high school. SA government asked organizers cancel year declined. expect numbers increase. 

[Rage festivals continue despite president calling postponement large gatherings festivals continue despite president calling postponement large gatherings Canadian say ""I'm sorry.""   20.5% total population: slowly growing. Faster expected; quite surprised went like 13% 20% visits page. I'll wait see booster affects new variant. well, I'll wait next year.

I normally worried things, live Texas people wearing masks. wear one go out, time I'm going class. honestly kind pointless kid wearing mask room full dozens college students without one.   feel like shocked 20,000 people turned real vaccines this.

But think people mixing horse paste home made numb. There's nuance though. quote Israeli Minister health J Post specifically stated efficacy either boosted 2 doses still within valid period (which would 6 months) well-protected.

[Full coming days accurate information efficacy vaccine Omicron, already room optimism, **there initial indications vaccinated vaccine still valid booster also protected variant,”** Horowitz said visiting Soroka Medical Center Beersheba Finance Minister Avigdor Liberman. data holds true, brutal. 

Farewell seeing family holidays, way I'm traveling. Flu shots nearly critical. wife ,a staff ICU physician teaching hospital, noted day 8 symptoms big tell delta, many known cases rounding day 8 Omi. Publish people die LOL, sorry, guess ""feel"" really replaced ""calculate"". feelings. think risk flying unvaccinated person acceptable think negative test sufficient risk mitigation fly, imperfect is.  automobiles?  Sorry... know terms protection symptomatic disease transmission, people got 2nd dose 8 months probably quite similar unvaccinated. terms delaying spread Omicron, may make sense group unvaccinated fully vaccinated. terms hospitalization, would weird choice even Omicron out-of-date vaccination, lot better unvaccinated uninfected person. 

OTOH, might believe many people exist anymore previously infected partially vaccinated (2 fewer doses) may actually similar severe outcomes boosted... 90% effective means every time encounter virus 90% chance avoid infection. meeting people naturally there's higher likelihood becoming infected due exposures.  Allegedly, count booster vaccinated, regular two doses among unvaccinated. Makes sense Israel, much elsewhere. Long covid would like word...  frank miraculous efficacy Delta infection paired waning immunity lack knowledge boosters time. They've always miraculous severe outcomes, though. ""miracle period"" pre-delta vaccines meant barely give COVID thought. parents (70s) boosted too. working convincing 19 year old needs get booster. Travel restriction? racists? Love conclusions based sample size 4 know like high five vaccinated, twice dangerous unvaccinated sounds like horrible news. 2G system honestly terrible idea, recoveries nearly significant reducing transmission vaccinated far better recovery-only. source this, field. I'm chemical engineer pharmaceutical industry. 


Ohh, interesting. thankful sharing knowledge.

Who manufactures API? parts complicated? tuning know Burgess Reactants quite abundant, right? imagine EDCI also relatively abundant. aminoacide aminoamide hard produce? amino-amide seems simple, like quite similar histidine maybe, tyrosine? amino-acid seems quite complicated, imagine hard part find raw materials.

Or maybe part process requires highly specialized conditions?  right assume country like Germany that's currently averaging 50000 delta cases day Omicron tough time becoming dominate unless something crazy like five times contagious evidence yet appear case. scenario delta essentially shield population Omicran taking right? Seeing vaccinated stop catching spreading virus (no different unvaccinated) what's point exactly? Many people Omicron variant fully vaccinated múltiple instances fully vaccinated people booster passing them. I’m sure you’re downvoted. Let know need find exact study I’ll post. “Fully vaccinated” includes booster Israel, soon way elsewhere. earliest widespread vaccination, recognized need boosters first. Obviously countries mass shutting travel holidays, things good.

They're big panic without evidence catastrophe coming -- that's people rolling eyes it. half world immediately shuts borders every time there's even suggestion new variant might exist, may well abandon hope ever traveling reconnecting again, going keep happening -- sustainable realistic way run globalized world.   find exact study would helpful, might take time dig. able google “vaccinated less likely contract covid” find variety sources. one comes quick google search: Traveling wild right now.

Thanks info :) That’s basically delta 3 months two doses. two-year old vaccinated, I'm approach. there's outbreak, weld athletes olympic village. Mine war whole life.  it’s even deadlier Delta. Interesting. cost unvaccinated seems getting steeper good majority anti-vaxxers like mom. don’t thinking skills necessary navigate misinformation internet. It’s unfortunate they’ll real victims hope nothing bad happens mom. I’m terrified 7month old can’t get kind vaccine vaccine doesn’t protect 90% infection now. Hey, got Moderna booster Saturday. felt terrible second dose back March, sore arm symptoms booster. Hope helps. Current airline safety measures yielded benefit low risk crash cost current ticket prices potential delays. people find trade-off acceptable. could also reduce road deaths level imposing swiss cheese approach 40mph speed limits, mandatory helmets 10-car following distances addition seatbelt laws current speed limits, people would say worth it.

I perfectly willing accept risk flying unvaccinated person would happily sit next them, trusting layers swiss cheese including ventilation, negative test vaccine. Would accept level risk? yes mind citing source.
I can't post peer review quote. approved administered US. people vaccinated AZ considered fully vaccinated since approved Please keep mind efficacy infection end-all be-all.

90% protection infection would reassuring R say ... 10x Delta's, extreme example. boosted would 10% likely unvaccinated catch variant, that's reassuring R monstrous.

The side even 50% protection infection would peachy R somehow dropped 1/10th Delta's (another extreme example). case, probably many unvaccinated catching virus, small risk halved vaccinated.

If wrong this, would love know, understand experts talk talk efficacy. mom doles vaccines pharmacy said dude came declared ""I getting covid vaccine today, I'd like say I'm forced get will"" literally one even acknowledged it, gave vaccine sent way. Like real, wtf going fucking petulant man babies?? happens likely happen omicron virus becomes dominant doesnt actually kill anyone? ensure delta variant dies works? though? far I'm aware vaccinated stop getting spreading it. I'm double vaccinated really get concerned people's vaccination status, they're putting higher risk. seems like really bad idea. medicinal version ""what button do?"" Back August, Israel released data waning immunity, least 1 million people got unauthorized 3rd booster one way deal dithering regulators. Unfortunately, protect best since public health officials bad job it. Oh get it? disclose vaccinated Astrazeneca? agree, there’s difference someone got first two doses recently (within past 4-5 months) got first doses beginning last winter. True, boosters working good thing.

But yeah, bad news children can’t get vaccinated too. even bad news people fully vaccinated haven’t gotten booster yet. Thanks. one said completely evades vaccine. must wooden shoes Exactly, I’m sitting desk 80% day doing? Due low vaccination rate all, unreasonable infer higher proportion 25% vaccinated either immune compromised high risk. would got vaccinated sooner everyone else. Granted, necessarily HIV, probably areas.
Of course unsupported conjecture, though unreasonable. think Jacobson issue. military authority order service members get number vaccines. issue commander chief ordering enforce requirement. informal polling extended family almost nobody interested getting booster. outdated take based last denial approval ones understand eligible treat like flu Shingles shot (like yeah yeah know I’m busy running pharmacy priority) someone latter category, appreciate this.

Yes. reached point January/February 2020. said ""We half-way beat virus, let's spread again!"" CDC bungled booster rollout bad probably slow uptake even variant around. post peer reviewed data showing causes light symptoms everyone first. Thank goodness Spain never religious, imagine sort stigma jokes would ensu  really doesn’t mean anything terms vaccine efficacy Omicron. 

Let’s say country 100% people vaccinated population 1m. hypothetical vaccine efficacy (completely preventing infection) 90%, projected 100k people would still become infected. 

The fact two fully vaccinated individuals country 80%+ eligible population vaccinated became infected isn’t surprising.

We wait data come draw conclusions. Crunch go NYC basing opinion ""likely lethal""? data points this? someone anaphylactic reaction Pfizer shot, I'm internally freaking out. Yeah, unhelpful set categories. would far useful data gave increase serious symptoms non-vaccinated (0 jabs), partially vaccinated (1 2 jabs), fully vaccinated (3 jabs). combining 0 1 2, saying group 40% increase Delta, way knowing whether folk 0 jabs 40% increase (what assume case) much larger increase, folk 1 2 jabs much 40% increase. Canada it’s different time first second shot way 4 weeks proved effective. think 2-3 months first second instead 4 weeks.  Might be, get infected, ~94% *continue* ruin everyone. No. forbidden that.

Even doctor, isn’t directly involved Covid stuff, seems overwhelmed tired trying keep patients safe can. solution protect yourself. Get booster soon elligible.  Thanks, helpful! I've regularly checking Walgreens CVS appointments can't find anything weeks out. tried walk-ins yet assumed appointment only, worth try. 

I'm experience everywhere within 30 minute drive Moderna, think I'll ok instead trying wait Pfizer. Yeah main worry double vaccinated means Healthcare systems high unvaccinated areas work? antibodies T-cells primed exact spike protein produced vaccines? would T-cells better identifying them? Oh no. Anyway... 2 shots past Israels 5 months wait time.  Honestly, well educated risks COVID posing children terrified.

RSV significantly likely kill 7mo old COVID. 

A recent study regarding long COVID concluded super rare kids.

The death rate hard peg John Hopkins Professor Medicine team audit child death data find single death underlying cause. 

Don't go hog wild, fellow parent young kid, try psych out.

O_o I'd like see clearer definition boosted: mean third dose, dose within 6 months?

How recently double-vaccinated compare boosters? don’t know reason. choices speak surely set us back. know definitely means work, financial infrastructure. note? updates transmissibility among vaccinated individuals? early tell? work situation:

We required vaccinated (not boosted) work tested week top that. Plus masking, people follow rule think someone watching. But, also don’t require employee close contact someone tested positive stay home quarantine increase testing interval “fully vaccinated” (not necessarily boosted). technically vaxxed employee go work normally even roommate partner covid positive. unreasonable concerned policy? also someone home immunocompromised I’m trying best extra cautious, especially now.

That’s… percentages work. Healthy silly prefer it. Unfortunately them, virus tired all.

This country 24.1 percent vaccinated.

I urge compare numbers country.

You're telling bs.

But completely missed word Trump comment. Racism stopping travel right? Since we're bringing discussion covid.. believe xenophobic word, correct? Yet, Biden ban travel Africa one bats eye..

Any way, I'll leave bs. Belgian passenger went 11 days symptoms appeared. I’m seeing south african reports patients complaining sore throats. confirmed yet, 8 I’m saying it’s worse people haven’t vaccinated….. know, fact shortage healthcare pandemic. Totally agree. I’ve thinking since Delta wave back August. Let us actually want protect kids, so. much bureaucratic bullshit. fuck sake! never end. always new variants, always reasons can't freedom back. idea wearing masks places 100% people vaccinated absolutely asinine. Exactly, I'm waiting see wait Omicron specific booster. Morocco closed borders France several days ago, today closed borders world. Catch up. Don’t forget Blitz 11th! State sites reopening. Nothing normal let's put bed now. 

The article talking says that... 

The one I'm talking about, u.s. Michigan well.. feel like increase normal... thus headlines, thus caution smidgen concern. 

Anything else want argue one about? could get near 100% loosely interpret: ""have smoked past?"" Probably “I don’t like wearing mask don’t wear one won’t”. Perfectly reasonable.

It's perfectly reasonable wear mask kill people. gets said every new variant. like claims second gunman mass shooting.

Bars generally involve people much closer together, going counter order, etc. probably find bars spread out, I'm comparing average bar average restaurant, I'm fairly certain average restaurants spacing. 

So far science goes, absolutely follows science spacing better. IIRC also evidence infected flu covid time significantly increased chance serious. covid super bad CO October governor approved everyone encouraged it. tough get em month   10% reduction transmission better 0% reduction transmission. kind nothing thinking got begin with. something discuss doctor list examples Here's thing though. know treatments men women. medications routinely tested women last decade. took Ambien debacle learned Ambien metabolizes differently stays body longer women change that. took car accidents women still influence Ambien 12-16 hours taking Ambien figure out! even legislation requiring drug companies include women clinical trials 2016. women STILL routinely left Phase 1 Phase 2 trials. Even drugs early testing STILL tested female mice rats worry female hormone might interfere medications. Ummm... want know since half population female? 

Most advocates women's health believe women routinely even medicated know appropriate doses women prescription drugs developed last century. ones know sure? Birth control pills meds developed specifically women. that, crap shoot. thing. Bars generally crowded, involve crowds approaching counter, built around socializing people. I'd argue bars far risky transmission perspective compared restaurants.

Now I'm sure bars people spaced always tables, average, I'm pretty sure would less spaced out. seem understand evolutionary pressure works.

The virus spreads exceptionally well pre-symptomatic incubation phases. therefore zero evolutionary pressure become less deadly, since virus doesn’t care die you’ve given eight people.  starting look little like Monthy Python sketch  Japan vacation package money well spent. 😐 US barely sequencing compared countries, especially wealthy Western countries, surprising Shutting borders appears self defeating act  Many people always really whacky ideas health. think sort get deluded thinking human body experts understand it. pandemic made people’s delusions much obvious.

Con Pfiezer - think heard switching different manufacturer could increase protection.

Any thoughts? I’m sure there’s I’m sure it’s real data lag. Deaths consistently low even since cases ticked delta. Smart messaging would focus less unvaxxed, protecting healthcare systems (which let's fair, lockdowns protecting countries world).

If healthcare systems get overwhelmed unvaccinated affected. Morocco shut borders UK showing rise lol. They're trigger-happy border closures.  long too…. Hopefully data coming soon whether booster dose durable long term response slowly waning way second shot does, somewhere between.  Well preventing entry variant spread numbers passengers helpful.

Maybe even case made foreigners coming country easily traced monitored citizens theory limit spread better foreigners coming citizens clue. Source? Good luck Maybe need face fact it’s longer possible increase percentage vaxxed population much already is. might widely available place, large metropolitan areas. Huh... guess we'll see. point... say ""calculate"" 6 7 mutations out...

This one 30. I'm immunologist idea much that's going matter but... seems like lot? song dance routine make people happy. sure who. weird see desperate governments continue delude idea control endemic disease that's spread nearly entire population world already. Seriously, stop. Everyone wants one take vaccine.

Why also appoint general fight flu, common cold (the coronavirus) sinus infections? insanity finally end? Yes, many people thinking they’re low risk vaccine beyond them. take chance? simple here, likely run POC talking Tuskeegee fears anti-vaxxer talking microchips horse paste. 

(To clear, plenty latter group, mostly Staten Island.) far easier find boosters Texas shots 9 months ago, even metros. able get booster flu shot day booked appointment CVS road. far cry cut throat scheduling back March. ""Back day share one needle vaccinate entire world."" energy lot less death. hopefully less stupidity They’re thread lmao  long game head. Health officials benchmarks based hospitalizations. That's strawman made up. Everything based cases. health officials plan lifting restrictions hospitalizations decrease, they've decided keep decision secret everyone fun. 

Hospitalizations go zero tomorrow would still mask mandate area. factor benchmark officials made lift mask restrictions. Yes messaging catastrophically bad. wages high enough new people come job offset negative factors allude to. One problem children 5 well. ones vaccinated politicians Double work half pay! It’s good science! scientifically correct? saw similar overnight compliance state. refusal understand goal posts move get new information astounds me.

Science literally changing take things new data hits. Also, people actually *followed* scientific suggestions adhered lockdown, masking, getting vaccines done locally could ship third world countries, we'd stand chance making now.

But way people acted, nope, we're boned. virus circulates 25% unvaxed people planet dodge vaccines, we've accomplished fuck-all.

Lockdowns start eventually vaccines mandatory, responded slaps wrist half-assed attempt shame. proud wearing mask? so? really required MSNBC trash. think it’s complicated that. science looking past. Nobody trying predict trajectory. idea increased spread, chances truly devastating mutation arise.

And vaccines prevent 90% people getting seriously ill peak, halve rate transmission. 

So point wear mask everyone vaccinated seriously deadly variants longer risk.

Since we’ve successfully eradicated diseases before, would think that’s terribly difficult idea grasp. need help. I’ve heard still transmit get covid even vaccinated? true? people want idea control lives look like near future. Psych even take IVs experience, thus making med Surg psych unit. severely resourced, staffed, trained psych unit. Seriously, I've talked many people know boosters available everyone, know exactly effective are, know choose whichever booster want, etc. etc. need tell friends family, y'all. read news. media always freaking out, gets peoples attention. possibly concern. changes protein vaccines target, data WAY early make statements regarding variant vaccines. Pushing boosters variant currently makes sense, hoping effective.

This process intuitive people, body get exposed Covid vaccines, make antibodies custom-tailored particular spike, makes whole range antibodies, sort ""anticipating"" future mutations. fine-tune production antibodies later, actually encounter mutations see need do. called antibody affinity maturation one reasons vaccines made Wuhan original spike still work well newer variants like Alpha Delta. clear, process happens natural infections, too, vaccine give important head start.

There's reason doctors nurses kind events get real PTSD small part make tragic decisions groups people equally deserving care. willingly unvaccinated patients much easier decision.

I'm NZ right bash Aussies 😉. thought China gunning America's place world.. Imo vaccinated needs automatically put back line order get bed.

People change starts really fucking scare them. Make well known get covid unvaccinated (and issues/illnesses prevent getting vaccine) try go hospital chances getting bed low.

I’m still thinking 6-3 conservative majority overturn Jacobson v Mass Odd dropped ""advisory"" already?  Much South Africa's lack vaccination low demand. Interesting read travel mandates might prevent visit. would mean *higher* proportion vaccinated people hospitalized general population. 

28.7% South Africans single vaccine shot. 24.1% two. Yet another reminder might well go ahead declare ""American Experiment"" failure move on. Moderna booster kicked ass. 3 days. see coming. need 4th, I'll schedule commission 3+ days. Resistant broad term.

It vaccine resistant meaning breakthrough infections reinfection likely vaccines could still offer strong protection hospitalization death. 

It resistant vaccines preventing symptomatic illness not, still prevent severe illness/hospitalization/death overall, similar flu vaccine.

We would back March 2020 vaccines natural immunity literally 0% effective everything, treatments created like anti viral pills also 0% effective - doomsday variant.

Highly unlikely! Maybe mild relatively, hospitalized usually mild. Exactly. Covid longer novel disease.

People getting stabbed asking people wear mask.  need start asking vax cards enter anywhere. Especially hospital. Omicron actually evade antibodies. Nope, let tourists since March 2020. think highly unlikely they're open tourists March now. realize goal I’m starting get whiplash Mandate Game. Why? Israel said Pfizer wanes 3onths, gave Pfizer Boosters 5 mos. UK narrowed wait 18 3 mos (but use mostly Astrazeneca?). France 5 mos wait. Science us show sweet spot? reason Israel seems less Policy/Political/Other issues decisions. Pharmacy check dates? NYC restaurants since September Everyone supply chain expert… Panic last thing people tbh. makes situation worse ""We know"" Believe me, hate lockdowns. new variant deadly escapes vaccine immunity, gonna do? less 10 percent seeking exemptions. That's small percentage seeking exemption Literally 1 person alone said that, provided zero data back up.

That enough Reddit comment sections fill cries of, ""This GREAT news!!"" hauled us around lined us boot camp like cattle inoculations. made lines. Flu syringe nose, next shot right arm, next left. Smallpox sucked cause itchy. Even got round two anthrax. one qualms back then. Can't imagine anyone would one now.  2 % CFR breakthroughs 50 accurate? case breakthroughs show official stats probably strongly skewed severe cases already, missing mild asymptomatic *unvaccinated* cases since vaccination modulates severity, there’s every reason think breakthrough detection even worse. case [the death rate among vaccinated compared unvaccinated far, far lower every age 

But agree need universal distribution boosters ASAP, still severe breakthroughs comfortable I’ve seen, boosters may “boosters” much necessary third doses complete vaccination regimen offer stronger immunity two-doses ever much long-lasting immunity. Lockdowns pointless, expensive people TIRED lockdowns. priority  Cases rose vaccinated unvaccinated spread virus reason think third dose mRNA wouldn’t enhance cellular immunity? understand little bonafide info, signs would point yes, right?  as?

Getting everyone vaxxed? don’t think happen. data exists, I’m unaware it, though surface sounds like reasonable worry. lot variables play. South Africa younger population, there's also lot HIV TB. age group likely HIV positive? age groups likely vaccinated? making particular effort vaccinate HIV positive? percentage people antibodies prior infection? younger kids getting now, they're ones neither vaccinated, previously infected?   Get one “tread harder, daddy” bumper stickers want start fight. even then, they'll open older/higher risk people first.

Good point, might till get booster even available. Hospitals already treating employees like shit pandemic. worked Healthcare 6 years. went help people. left hospital administrators sociopaths care patients employees. similar situation. grandmother 90s great health wise. month half I've gathering documents get Japan real pita. can't even get appointment application even process says take 5 days 2 months. Exposure + Time = Risk. time masked, less time indoors, less density people around you, even aersols, far less risk. 

&amp;#x200B;

then theres ventilation, many restaurants better bars (which also factor density)

&amp;#x200B;

ontop that, risk reduction distanced parties. still risk aerosol, much less lower theoretical viral load. 

&amp;#x200B;

I see eye eye risk reduction locking mentality That's called triage happen, situation dire. problem overwhelmingly unvaccinated COVID patients consume enormous amounts healthcare resources needed treat ailments. Massive amounts surgeries delayed, cancers missed progress, ER wait times become unbearable, etc.

We need start thinking ahead unvaccinated people impact healthcare system implement sort ""extended temporal triage,"" prioritizing vaccinated patients less acute still important medical needs. defines every political party unless naive biased Italian National Institute Health: evidence Omicorn causes severe disease yet clear whether transmissible look list conditions cdc qualified people, hard time believing people age 30 don’t something least technically qualified them. would bet history kidney stones would count honestly.

But regardless, doesn’t matter now. told everyone get 2 months ago, least finally have. Unless kid 5...like myself. We're screwed. Enough enough. refuse wear mask anymore.  walk in? turn away unvaccinated, also gonna turn away lung cancer patients smoke accident victims wearing sealtbelt. doctors nurses took oath ""to harm"" can't turn away anyone. Enough enough. I'm going wear mask longer. life ever go back normal? Ground asses 1 yr. shut up. Ok. still change fact centuries old precedent related federal issued vaccine mandates. Employer based mandates state based mandates supported case law  really troll, someone wants make ass assumptions addlibs.... im going stop em. 

I made observation source op, offered national perspective issue... homeboy decided wanted pop about.... ???  Stuff. 

Who's trolling who!?  Lol. like war. nature. Humans good fighting physical manifestations something can't see. even understand germ theory little 100 years ago. Also, I'm kinda done argument bc grandparents suffered more, complain? I'm pretty sure happy situation either; many also still alive even they've largely moved on, 86 yr old grandma included. Suffering badge honor. think gonna long time start looking time anything waste. new variant greatly bypass vaccine protection, support new restrictions. 

If can't greatly bypass vaccine protection, going make sacrifices unvaccinnated. They've months get vaccine. someone chooses get vaccinated point, going to. can't live rest lives protecting idiots. Kind urban coastal states avoided bad delta wave hit harder original strain (with approval previous federal administration). probably get booster. Delta still predominant variant Omicron targeted booster available least 3 months. even then, they'll open older/higher risk people first. rabies vaccine worst I’ve — made every joint swell could barely walk. repeat four times month. dying plus. need societal breakthrough.

Mother 13 year old, 4 year old, 1 year old. 13 year old vaccinated homeschooled keep accidentally bringing home younger kids. I’m thankful haven’t tried go back normal now. starting feel like overreacted. Happened American sports teams previous strains. Broncos use wide receiver quarterback one game. Dumb af UK narrowed window 12 weeks. Israel France may 5 mos. 6 mos waiting time still? Yep, agree major failure US letting masking. That's literally biggest thing let delta take hold here.  way complicated that. might low ICU numbers one week skyrocket next mandates lifted... clear, china able build fully functional hospital in...10 ? Days. done. agree that, using phrasing sources use variant. talking specific boosters used new variant, pushing booster solely reason right. everyone eligible, husband drive Everett (a city 30 miles outside main metropolitan area Seattle) week out. wanted appointment city, would've wait 2-3 weeks. 

Before everyone eligible, appointments plentiful Seattle. immediate next day, maybe 2-4 days out. News flash everyone—everything government ever always based first foremost self-interest, regardless government says motives are. charities comes geopolitics. Sometimes geopolitically correct move aligns morally correct move, made former rather latter.  seem matter US. People get sent bill like, 110k medical bills usually live long enough pay off. 

But also healthcare wildly inflated. think kind thing would work motivate anyone get vaccinated. think jobs requiring getting terminated thing works. insurance companies charging more. ""rugged"" individualism bugs sh#t me.

Tying healthcare working absurdly damaging America. states good job (apart NSW), federal government much delay vaccine rollout Okay super tinfoil hat-y, leader publicly traded company basically single use fuck ton “subscribers.” It’s exactly bad covid continues, especially tax payers cover research. 

Let’s wait see really tell us anything new. Everyone knows vaccines less effective omicron. question much less effective. know lot next two three weeks. I've never even borderline skeptical Covid vaccines, comments, given implications, concern scientists I've talked to . . . like 'this going good.'

He's given interview full conjecture commentary dressed analysis, knowing full well company essentially committed developing variant vaccine whilst Pfizer chosen wait information sequencing. They've said take around fortnight.

Any comment made Moderna send markets rising falling change cost everyday essentials like oil.

This downside companies able monetise vaccines. saw demonisation Astra Zeneca blowup around blood clots, we're seeing cynical PR exercise Bancel Moderna. already stand gain plenty booster shots, good come running mouth conjecture rather waiting genuine scientific findings commenting?   isn’t true. Hospitalizations increased rapidly epicenter South Africa started. Sound look :) ( starts running) They're also getting rid unvaxxed nurses close 20% states. pay. Moderna said optimistic  thought MRNA vaccines work making body manufacture spike proteins, recognised body antigens - thereby triggering immune response?

Since spike protein Omicron purportedly different, would possible immune system recognise it? mechanistically impossible, need wait data?

Appreciate corrections case understanding flawed. Africa asked patents dropped could vaccinate CEO said nah wait us build production plant coming someone working Moderna. shoot foot (stock wise) real. letting people know click don’t think they’ve trolled. give coronavirus wants. Also past talked vaccine efficacy always talking symptomatic infection. swabbing people's noses every day see asymptomatically traces smallpox DNA nasal cavity. need remember definition efficacy changed virus. That's priority. I've done part.  Imagine small minded think putting fuzzy costume fun negates developing fucking miracle vaccine. Yeah several years seperated Fiancée... I'm possitive experiencing misery. Fuck virus Note Moderna took like rocket yesterday, heavy volume stated would develop vaccine aimed Omicron variant. doubt coincidence. solution simple, live way used also love polar fleece balaclava, extends vital neck area. cozy! state governments aren’t involved gotta schedule pharmacies live. scheduled one, arrived early, waited hour go back work. first two shots nascar track like 1500 national guard personnel nurses banging jabs. need governments keep shit going don’t rely CVS/Walgreens 45 different “we’re hiring!” signs littered throughout store. Damn realize NYC 800 deaths single day, true absolutely horrendous Moderna came said skeptical vaccines help variant : ( miss pre-pandemic life half population even wear masks get vaccinated. doubt follow lockdown order. Good thing everyone taking seriously planning “normal” holiday season. Probably true. made vaccinated people feel safe everyone let guard barrier gestures.  Every movie/book/historical document ever says go ahead prevent now.

You can't prevent it.

It already United States.

The virus become endemic, we're eradicating we're currently eradicating common cold. Variants going spread. normal expected. Michigander enjoying benefit walks. nice! quote Rush: ""If choose decide, still made choice.""

We know booster works, shot again. can't dangerous already approved. approved once, going fine booster.

Saying ""boosters old people young people"" confusing backed science either. We've already injected billions young people thing! They're perfectly fine. Yup. It’s impossible balance us parents. 

What’s proposal parents jobs kids, then?

Nobody offering parents under-5s job income replacement they’re going work.  52 countries, I’ve never seen that. I’ve pretty much stamps, apart changing countries within Europe Source? Thanks. Ironically I'm opposite end, wanted visit family holidays, currently stuck Japan due pandemic practical risk going back things like closures could happen anytime. gone home since whole pandemic started, help home country handled pandemic well vaccination numbers high yet. That’s true levels. least non-majority government help get things done effectively genuine feedback party voting. Ontario Dougy Ford complained Trudeau giving money make schools safe, hire people on. came long ago $2.7bil given spent $0. Everything party line promising best sick leave country voting down. Promising schools safe bought air purifiers CBC tested found you’d need 80 bug room effective. also spent bunch money bracelets that’ll beep get close anyone. never made. cried TV though okay. Yeah really scummy play CEO. coincidence he's saying day said Moderna create new set Omicron-specific vaccines. Yeah, would go regular testing sure. Thank you, person money subscribe.

This sounds great holiday coming up. /s  part, hate lies. always obsessed getting bottom whatever topic/thing fascinates me. made nice living simply researching various phenomena objects interest/passion becoming expert.

I figured 2008 financial crisis would unfold early 2008. became expert various collectibles took popularity price. good at.

I became obsessed COVID January 2020. family friends completely prepared COVID February 2020 thanks relentless hounding.

In May 2020 opportunity speak real worldwide expert immunology. got talk length. asked frank thoughts expect. know startling opinion was? told back May 2020 virus permit “durable immunity”. virus outsmart lasting attempts immunity.

So, heard Pasi Pentinnen interviewed CNBC Friday morning early (the yet named) Omicron variant may evade forms immunity far, knew bad. Then, narrative changed “It’s Mild”. hate narrative truthful.

The truth always comes out. knows it; could true, reason he's coming saying instead literally everyone else saying 'well know yet' wants Moderna stocks rise. He's businessman. Every person coming Australia vaccinated recent negative test. Omicron getting regardless. Yes, they’re also Fury. one thing ""immunity"" number measure.

Escape monoclonals escape NAbs escape T-cells.

Since coronaviruses clearly evolve antigenically escape immunity, like influenza, expect one well, complete escape recognition T-cells unlikely.

The Moderna CEO seems trying walk tightrope creating enough fear stoke demand new variant booster causing much panic markets. medical community communicating that. People chose ignore it. recent months media seem keen convincing china covid strategy bad…why? risks county (San Mateo, CA) virtually zero. get folks Reddit living like Nashville might jaundiced situation get tired told strangers online live way. Nope. Makes sense given low rates here. I’ll enjoy meal thank much. ever happened that? problem can’t low priority can’t effectively oxygenate… He’s obviously talking NYC number hospital beds available doctors treat patients scale percentage # new cases. matter 0.3% 1% hospitalization cases bloom quickly number patients overwhelm health systems. Honestly, makes US sound... well, childish. There's mask mandate country everyone I've seen obeys (we share anti maskers, they're uncommon enough seen people violating mandate).   Precisely, think causing bit panic early statement, mean clearly says PREDICTION. Let's wait solid data hope best. Prevalence anything total population. comparative strains *prevalent* Delta already. can't find 11% seen lets go another article 6 days ago says 20%. still pretty low number. ask sub. realized even want know.  super annoying Fauci said trumps biggest mistake letting states handle restrictions themselves, Biden needs nationalize response Agree person. think agenda. reporting experience / data had. think waaaay many people parroting mindlessly without context people want hope hold to. self-comforting mechanism. early tell whether milder symptoms yet. Possible, sure, early. protect random hickies! I'm buying 11% figure. Vast majority people know got booster. highlighted more? bet many us miss crucial detail buried post reply. issue doctors isn’t debt. It’s med schools residencies. 

The supply chain plain fucked over. Beijing resident say nice able travel go anywhere please China little fear covid, watching western family friends, even vaccinated, still living fear daily. Iirc first getting vaccines 75% considered good terms protection. 90 something percent got ridiculously good. I'm wondering fairly good translates terms protection. SARS-CoV-2 vaccine protection deaths among US veterans July October 2021, VE-D age &lt;65 years 73.0% Janssen, 81.5% Moderna, 84.3% Pfizer-BioNTech; VE-D age ≥65 years 52.2% Janssen, 75.5% Moderna, 70.1% Pfizer-BioNTech. Findings support continued efforts increase vaccination, booster campaigns, multiple, additional layers protection Likely necessary *far* less. Chise Twitter MRNA developer Johns Hopkins saying way fully evades fully even (as now) alot. Check top Hahahahaha seen surges associated outdoor sporting events though, far I'm aware.  Yeah, it’s shame anal wide spread Maybe let's wait see actual information.

That's problem - really still early really know much. educated guesses made scientists, many unknowns. 

This seem might partially contradict South African doctor indicated patients tested positive omicron variant subjected relatively mild conditions. thing is, based **handful** cases - exactly confident extrapolating based thin sample size.  
 
Truth is, new much known. *could* spreading like crazy. not. *could* dangerous Delta. less dangerous. same. One two vaccines *could* less effective preventing symptoms. not.  
 
I wish luxury waiting acting. might late. There's much chance omicron could bad, really bad. fear realistic course action act we're looking worst-case scenario. hindsight overreaction, it. alternative acting could would much worse. point I'm making ironically make anti-social choices prefer deal others like themselves. I’ve noticed veterinarians year well.

""Man vested interest selling vaccines says we'll need new vaccine."" article also dude Pfizer saying essentially opposite... 

I still think best wait definitive, unbiased data gathered interpreted go shouting either hopium *or* hellfire brimstone.  Sinopharm Sinovac quite active getting vaccine manufacturing going Africa. Mostly northern Africa, though (Egypt, Algeria, Morocco), maybe logistical constraints. Winter coming. actually ran across issue planning career change, medicine, thought.

I'm going need something else current field, hard expensive slow get trained stuff desperately need. way. think extremely generalized idea research back up... hotter months south bring people indoors, colder months north same. trump method think defense mechanism people use keep feeling hard emotions. People time many types situations. humans survived long species. Humans keep trucking seeing positive side shit matter what. helps us survive also helps us 'notice' kinds horrible shit. Look way everyone ignoring climate change - crazy. J&amp;J shot well Pfizer's shot. studies efficacies regard combo? Pfizer + Moderna capacity less 300M month? probably 3 months functioning vaccine couple months production even provide supply G12 (assuming pre-emptively start production starting trials make sure they're effective). half year, still much closer 1 year 4 week multiplicative scale. Also want sell many doses possibly can. formula turns best, guaranteed 4-5 billion doses booster sales top already sold doses. 

We need listen Moderna, also patiently wait hear experts saying. Re: travel bans

They basis evidence. did, we'd banning travel several European countries well. is, good look, basically theater. 

As terrible precautions US, matter days omicron widespread here.  Uh huh, that’s though guy... yeah, travelers everywhere, but- leave hospital travel X, hospital hire traveler hospital C turn needs one B... problem isn’t traveling, symptom. problem enough staff all, retirements, deaths burnouts- shifting pawns field doesn’t change fact aren’t enough pieces play game. word reddit absolutely loves lockdown Bostwana (at least far know)  Good luck developing long covid mild cases then, lowering guard down. vaccinated people still able infect vaccinated people Delta, enforcing masks public spaces priority checking vax status. think general greater good modified vaccine faster developed, tested, approved produced, imagine current distributed boosters already targeted mutations Beta Delta common Omicron, much less panic. shall see. Holiday weekend.  Dude, least knowing Moderna stock movements going say things like ""any comment made Moderna send markets rising falling"".

Moderna jumped Omicron announced. move today same, surprising it?

Moderna one product company - mRna covid vaccine. covid raging, mean, people going buy stock matter CEO says. value rapidly rising, lots volatility - 1800% since January 2020, Covid really got going. trading $368 right now. high year $450 August.

As Pfizer, trading twice value Moderna January 2020 - $36 Pfizer, $18 Moderna. Pfizer reached all-time high $55 today, nearly growth. again, type company.

Point is, think look stock movements CEO comments rue monetization public fear. mean, he's saying vaccine effective. good company, regardless stock market speculators today. mean, I'm sure would rather constantly updating vaccines, paying R&amp;D cost that, right?

There things use mRNA vaccines for. Like cancer. Moderna would love nothing done Covid vaccine protocols, really see interpret kind manipulative action. He's telling truth, global pandemic, people like guy talking buying stock Moderna Pfizer covid vaccines world obviously needs them, companies attractive, simple that. 

Nothing nefarious.  getting vaccines Africa ... assumes availability vaccines primary issue; not. 8 countries impacted US travel ban, 5 (covering 90% population countries) asked Pfizer slow deliveries vaccines worried expiring vaccines sitting around. South Africa used less two-thirds vaccines they've received less 25% population vaccinated. US, available vaccines mean magically get people's arms. 

The West become convenient scapegoat lack vaccinations countries, real reasons complicated involve incompetence African governments mistrust African leaders people.  I'll wait see actually effective Omicron first. felt pretty lousy 2nd shot Moderna, almost reaction booster. arm even sore. suggest ? First , head major pharmaceutical company. Ofcourse he's gonna new vaccine, look stocks shot announcement. Second, vaccines may loose efficacy, highly unlikely rendered useless still provide ample protection severe illness hospitalizations. still know next nothing variant take deep breath jump conclusions based corporate executive say clearly lucrative interests mind.  noteworthy Moderna Pfizer differ confidence effectiveness current vaccine new virus strain.  Okay, that’s deal... March 2022... that’ll 2 year anniversary thing, I’m strongly advocating seriously consider concluding precautions. Life must, eventually, go on. must also remember found vacuum South Africa, positivity rate 1% time. even epicentre Gauteng, one cannot say replacing Delta. early know. wait results countries high delta numbers already.

Gauteng positivity rate 19% country 10%. Yeah, so, I'm 18% people. Let tell you, take Nostradamus see vaccine going end this. all, vaccine ended pandemic, multinational pharmaceutical corporations would longer able profit pandemic. Can't rake sweet, sweet booster shot profits first shot effective need boosters Totally agree. huge difference public health policy science research. One proactive balance risk assessment, slow methodical process understand things work. totally different beasties.   Seriously injectors used mass vaccination, alternative needle syringes diabetics inject insulin. However, World Health Organization longer recommends jet injectors vaccination due risks disease transmission

That’s crazy shit, obviously didn’t good idea diseases spread. I’m glad it’s sanitary now. SARS2 researcher, always surprises SARS2 academic articles open source news articles aren't. funny academic journals surprisingly ahead curve something (although sustained). person also said vaccinations would give strong defenses year potentially forever, defenses getting stronger time. statement couldn’t turned wrong. ultra racist leadership. government's pandemic response ""you done COVID test, blame rest foreigners""

Japan got low obesity numbers constant mask wearing. We're short housing, it'll work out. Sorry, say people going get tired, that's I'm getting tired. law serious punishment breaking Lighten flower    Thats related motoring offence though. see inside courtroom covid incident unfair. pandemic running amok rich countries shared poor countries comes vaccine roll out...look variant started? reason , look blaming unvaxxed!

Good news early tell? It’s protecting vulnerable, though that’s really important. Think businesses service workers get absolutely screwed everytime switch back forth policies due spread. Imho it’s worth see winter make sure don’t ugly wave hopefully start phasing weather’s warm we’ve got smallest vaccinated.  vaccination rates (barring Spain , Portugal Italy) still far European governments lackluster best comes booster shots. Let's make ""both sides equally blame"" unfortunately case central Europe small stubborn minority holding rest society back.

""Spiked protein"" part binds first enters human cells, marked antibody produced vaccine. 

For reasons, National Institute Infectious Diseases strongly concerned infectivity higher before, effectiveness vaccine significantly reduced, risk reinfection increase.

However, since experimental data epidemiological information sufficient far, pay close attention effects infectivity age group, severity symptoms, effects vaccines actual society. said necessary continue.

In Gauteng, outbreak started, 3/4 patients admitted hospitals still UNVACCINATED. Even mild symptoms, don’t know many people go long Covid. That’s I’m afraid anything. day grocery store overheard guy making fun wearing face shield mask (actually 2 masks probably saw one). don’t care look crazy. I’m vaccinated, I’m still afraid long Covid. Even omicron produces sniffles 100% people, deaths, I’m still letting guard comes town won’t know long Covid statistics. chronic fatigue syndrome 20 years it’s disabling cost career. I’m perplexed focusing solely hospitalizations deaths ignoring tsunami people disabled long Covid, many mild infections. wish got talked more, might save people disabling fatigue could prevent it.  theory variant currently driving surge Europe likely still delta dominate?

The theory current wave driven Omicron never made much sense. countries level sequencing, western countries enough determine variants dominant. Determining prevalence different variants within 1% accuracy well within possibilities countries western Europe. something Delta become important factor, would've known well started meaningfully impact case growth. current peak Delta.

What discovery Omicron samples travel ban shows mostly travel bans effective keeping new variant out. may slow spread little bit, virus slippery contain reactive travel bans. want keep out, need quarantine everyone entering country. fucked us we're careful. data available weeks, probably reviewed again.

We 80% entire population vaccinated ongoing booster program happening time. Hopefully devolve chaos. Thanks educated insight :) even get point ? intermediates escaped Omicron's patient zero got current form (unless isolated hospital somewhere months getting treatment) see I'm Canada pretty much every Filipino know work got theirs. What's overall rate there? 80s would less interaction China Western world… fewer people, less travel general… might fizzled booster last weekend, much same. think anti vaxxers issue taking modified vaccine every time there's new variant.  tale old time...c'mon now. doses around 50% dont think rate would 50% Thinking need leave CEO’s mba shit consider scientists/researchers say Wow. Interesting. Wondering Netherlands see travel restrictions S. Africa despite thought leadership omicron discovery. trip Mexico planned less 3 weeks. Triple vaxxed eager data. Ugh. true general consensus pre-CoVID travel restrictions would ineffective highly transmissible respiratory virus.

However, pandemic, travel restrictions, combination good contact tracing, mass testing localized lockdowns, worked several countries maintain essentially zero CoVID-19.

Travel restrictions (such quarantine entry) drastically reduce number imported cases. nothing else, matter long run, cases slip grow self-perpetuating outbreaks. good contact tracing behind quarantine barrier, put small fires pop up.

That's mainland China Taiwan right now, Australia, New Zealand Vietnam year. Don’t forget lovely state Mississippi. Tate Reeves idiot follower Trump white American Jesus. Go lock then. People enough lockdowns. important part flights.

""Most daily increases stage Gauteng, 81%. tremendous increase past 10 14 days,” said Dr Michelle Groome, head division public health surveillance response Dr Waasila Jassat, also NICD, said unvaccinated patients suffered severe symptoms vaccinated ones, likely face hospitalisation infected new Covid-19 variant. reported 87% admissions Pretoria unvaccinated “We tracking across country since February, say much higher chance death among unvaccinated,” Dr Jassat said. vaccine common cold BC never needed.

Those mutate right now.

The reason vaccine nobody bothers invest, risk thoses viruses pose small. vet medicine certain coronaviruses quite dangerous vaccines them, reason got fast vaccine SARS-CoV-2 first place.

But experts anticipated significant mutation drive COVID, like common cold Corona viruses, mutate all.

China 2nd largest donor vaccines. donated 100 million doses Even Covax buy Chinese vaccines

Covax commonly buys vaccines. That's unusual all.

The US' decision export vaccine first half 2020 major contributor worldwide vaccine shortage. world relied largely two suppliers: China Europe.

Thank you. resisted, know hard get China last 2 years. don’t agree statement. 

First, country 75.4% fully vaxxed shows rate similar Canada (75.5%). campaign vaccinate 5-11 years old starting imminently potentially increase coverage. 

Belgium also administered booster shot 13% population many countries. cannot find data Canada.ca cannot compare least European level Belgium top Unvaxxed crowding hospitals

While I’m saying unvaxxed people hospital (proportionally greater crowed), everyone getting shots, areas vaccination rate 90% 90% patients hospitals fully vaccinated people. Why? old underlying condition. reality. 

I believe vaccine protects people severe forms disease doesn’t work 100%, especially doesn’t work 100% risk person. 

But concert youngsters told enter Covid pass, social distancing (so I’m blaming them, told fine). may get infected without much symptoms next week go visit grandma ends hospital despite fully vaxxed. 

One thing well compare size studied area density population area. Belgium small, compact dense country. compared places similar conditions (here you’re comparing 30.000 km2 country 376p/km2 density 10m km2 4p/km2 density, obviously situation different. Clusters spread faster high density areas).  lol good luck that. would full rebellion hands ever tried enforce that. new crisis team joke tbh.

I've mentioned quarantining elsewhere, well ability state governments temporarily revoke people's drivers licenses time get vaccinated. fire hate saying this, I'm interested debating anyone. agree me, that's fine. simply think matter life death--we've already lost 770,000 Americans, 100,000 new infections every day--a temporary curtailing civil liberties acceptable necessary. [To expand this, indicate currently mapped mutations, especially spike images built check Stanford database logic worked UK last year ""Protect NHS"". really can't see impact year But... Serious question: mRNA vaccines (that one used worldwide, countries higher rates vaccination) teach body recognize virus itself, spike protein, new variant gigantic amount mutations spike protein, logic / expected vaccine efficacy decrease severely?

We want move lives every right want it. vaccinated, part wanting finally move completely valid, I’m pretty sure health care workers want thing too. Anti-vaxxers aren’t going change minds this. 

We need wait see data actually data-driven. can’t pro-science it’s inconvenient. idea you’re talking about, one ends hospital ICU without symptoms beforehand, there’s absolutely need asymptomatic person take So, don’t think happening, lot science data published publicly.

That said, probably best type response true, panic always going worse Omicron gonna bring self preservation back. [antigenic likely we'll end delta evade vaccines.

If know American corporate culture, optics important compared money. Thats it. patent evergreening done too. They'll keep selling 'slightly modified' versions vaccine forever could, claiming better latest variant. Even original vaccine good enough. I’m getting mine hours. We’ll see goes. either get sick go work. I'll wait ultimate shot DLC. Same. 2nd shot took 2 days. Fever, chills, insomnia.
Booster lighter version that.

And would again. heartbeat. light dose virus, actual virus would probably done serious damage. Sure, vaccinate vulnerable then? big scary virus deadly NZ man killed gunshot counted covid death...this one example. People died flu every year, died old age, heart attacks etc. covid well, get lumped pile inflate data. people see crazy. money control.My guess digital ID go hand hand vaccine passport. good citizen get go play good friends. think public access information data? think (sponsored) media telling whole truth? thanks addition, know that. passengers get refueling (potentially giving omicron christmas lucky few), need stay plane? tried googling, know enough aviation find rock-solid answer.  cannot 100 percent resistant, fact number cases people returning SA double vaccinated mild symptoms. know higher end lower moment.. remark protection wearer [Danish SARS-CoV-2 infection occurred 40 participants (1.8%) mask group 53 (2.1%) control group ”. 
 
My recent comment refute 70% claim, supported study I’ve ever seen. Droplet absorption ≠ transmission reduction.   China banned travel visas lot countries already current Moderna vaccine still effective Omicron, determined outside experts well Moderna sells updated versions vaccine. Moreover, would face backlash turned mislead public thinking original vaccine would ineffective. realistic analysis incentives involved would need take factors account. Got booster morning. crazy free insanely easy yet still got people even refusing first. argument is: current vaccines effective, reason get vaccinated. Academic articles get public funding. News organizations pay way. world close again? 
Regardless dangers virus, governments answer time ? 
To continued..  Yes needed 2 weeks ago late matter now. Here's feedback: brain work. I’m really starting wonder crowd would recommendation breathe air. I've worked newspaper says may, might could pretty much say like cover themselves. watch super hero movies. Harder wash scarf though. I'll booster Christmas. I'm normal holiday traveling Europe New Year's. gonna self-isolate wait there's omicron booster time we'll probably dealing sigma variant. take J&amp;J AstraZeneca? good vaccines mRNA-based. suspect actual sentiment going behind scenes government circles around world, explains rapid jump close travel despite lot public-facing talk ""remain calm, could big deal."" Hopefully omicron goes way variants fizzled out. Lol really? echo chamber. Australia weeks ago potentially depending happens new variant. idiots home reddit Netflix? Watching super hero movies 5 years old? ban too? Especially effectively evades vaccines article hints at. 
“Dr. Jassat said around fourth patients admitted Covid-19 Gauteng vaccinated.” Nah man crazy. I'm double vaxxed I'm getting third now. There's point getting booster old vaccine chief Moderna saying likely effective chief biontech said need wait weeks.

I'll get new formulation vaccine otherwise fuck that.  Alright, go lock house next 6 months again. Let rest us live lives. It’s likely technology address pandemic technology caused lab. Let get straight: brought Canada vaccinated travellers? many people fall trap misinformation. sucks see, family also refusing booster made garbage. November 11th still falls November 19th.

Meanwhile anti-vax anti-mask dumb dumbs decided pandemic over. Yes, although let's pretend simply getting countries vaccines get job done. drivers HIV pandemic (poor education, malnutrition poverty, lack medical distribution infrastructure antiretrovirals, on) also make difficult drive successful vaccination campaigns. 

It taken multi-generation effort widespread vaccinations impoverished parts Africa vaccines we've long time. Simply shipping doses regions - even flying healthcare workers help administer - half battle. Actually getting shots arms hard part. Almost definition, uncontrolled HIV/AIDS challenging vaccinate in: super impoverished, limited medical infrastructure, possibly suspicious Western medicine, on. richer educated cities regions typically lower rates uncontrolled HIV/AIDS able get testing treatment.   excessive required increase chances dying? makes wonder ""origins"" variant. variant originated country say Netherlands spread SA first reported SA.

Still, 43.7% elderly gotten booster. Unfortunately CDC/FDA flubbed messaging this, many portable think optional thing paranoid, something every elderly person getting soon qualify.  doesn’t matter intentions said that. sound reasoning. don’t make broad sweeping generalizations based anecdotal evidence wanted say experience patients took care mild disease also younger healthier. can’t make even intelligent hypothesis based paucity information. right lot people took quotes context. 


The worrisome aspect quickly governments moved close borders. speculation, makes wonder internal data suggesting might big one. literally removed nationwide mask restrictions US delta ravaging India. response right seems like experienced back early 2020 Don’t confuse ignorance conspiracy. ""free"" healthcare (that pay taxes nose for, free all) joke 150 ICU province 14 million people means start delaying elective surgeries. Also, hospitalized consistent term. vaccinated come get oxygen day rarely go ICU intubated. (At least recent Delta wave) This. numbers game: people unvaccinated, greater spread opportunity mutate. really simple that. interesting look different variants affected different countries. don’t either honest someone easily manipulated others causing death tragic? God, that’s great coding. Unfortunately statement milder symptoms based one doctor’s quote leaves huge jump hospitalizations occurring Omicron hot spot South Africa. One concerning trend this: “Dr. Jassat said around fourth patients admitted Covid-19 Gauteng vaccinated.” low level vaccination South Africa that’s troubling know little know much 2 weeks. Isn’t annoying? think main difference found one earlier. time found Delta, knew everywhere. Pfizer says get Omnicron-specific shot market 100 days. 

I got booster couple months ago, due. right around 6 months past booster 100 day prediction accurate.  daft? numbers averages per thousand posted. add up, average country. 

You hilariously wrong. r/confidentlyincorrect right? Wow. I've heard close trusted friend. realize common. don’t love reading individual anecdotes 2 years pandemic infected millions differently? soon  Japan shut borders different lockdown. see Australia new Zealand still locked horribly false?

I think false. Dutchie knowledge special connection Netherlands South Africa due colonial history would cause abnormally high traffic two countries compared countries region former Dutch colony. know Dutchies like travel basically *everywhere*. matter go, *always* find Dutchies there. Also, South Africa seen easy gateway entire south African region. Combine hub-function Schiphol fulfills got high traffic explained.

But could wrong! 18,000 case day junk data reason scrubbed lot websites. mutate common cold. Influenza completely different virus rhinoviruses/coronaviruses/etc. cause common cold. question remains lot natural immunity omicron big advantage infecting people immunity even compete alongside Delta naive hosts. Inappropriate pun vacancies turning subscriptions.  6%. That's 600 per THOUSAND. 

/r/confidentlyincorrect Oh yes definitely, trying say anything otherwise.
I thought point one could consider specific discussion.  like improvement studies going 4-6 weeks 6-8weeks? Changing months 6 month may give protection, surge like last winter, need immediate protection, protection 4 months.  got pfizer vaccine originally I'm looking get booster. big difference taking Moderna Pfizer booster? 

 would prefer Moderna one, they're different effectiveness wise might grab Pfizer places around places making people get shot before. big difference supply food greatly outpaces demand food world. Famine starvation solely distribution issue, supply. COVID vaccines supply distribution. ordered countries fewer purchased have-nots. like improvement studies going 4-6 weeks 6-8weeks? Changing months 6 month may give protection, surge like last winter, need immediate protection, protection 4 months.  2 masters public health including epidemiology, posting updates year facebook #statsdaddy 40%. capital region almost 90% tho. booster rollouts also progress. people want vaccinated, problem logistics Man...I'm confused. Got 2 doses early could antibodies good thing. can't find anything saying much antibodies relatively young healthy person decline 6 months much antibodies booster give me? recall Moderna booster got approved said evidence boosted antibodies all, approving match Pfizer. recall saying young men myocarditis higher thought previously (though still low, much lower covid itself, I'm fine initial vaccination).

So booster likely work Omicron, doctor CDC said antibodies gone much, I'm relatively low risk - get another shot increase risk myocarditis feel like garbage 2 days increase antibodies like 2% (completely made-up number, higher could make sense)? Genuine question? can't seem find info that.

FYI: I've trying stick trusted news sites like new york times etc. Western world prioritizes vaccinating globe, vaccine inequity bigger issue. There's many people poorer countries would gladly get vaccinated, access. Hopefully Omicron variant wakeup call. 

Rich countries hoard vaccines, booster full population, spreading unchecked someplace else, matter time mutates. Let's take Moderna CEO says seriously. Dude stands make crap ton money current vaccine formula needs tweaked people need another ""omicron booster"". fast says court thinks banning abortion government overreach shots keep Americans dying are.  Went waaaaay head infant mortality rate 0.6% US friend it? 50 people confirmed omicron far? Mostly young people would little symptoms anyways even without vaccine? variant idea severity disease? Way soon tell based type data. 

Anyways, thing anywhere near 100% resistance terms severe disease reasonable. B/T cell immunity bee shown even recognize things like SARS1 IIRC. Even 25% resistence would surprise me. infectious protection concerning imo, vaccines like AZ, could reduce protection infection near Like said, trace lineage variant follow one previous variants. means could've already mild, became transmissible never developed Delta vaccine determined existing vaccines still worked. There's also finite amount food, kids eat mean kids Africa get eat. mean like since took office? Always look bright side life.  Thanks, clarification helpful. really seem like people beginning adopt anti-vaxx rhetoric variant got discovered. people take covid prevention super-seriously basically saying (without evidence) vaccines completely worthless need bring back social distancing stay home orders ASAP Omicron variant.  That’s bit hyperbolic. You’re wrong high likelihood resistance vaccines doesn’t mean they’re null void. doesn’t mean everyone vaccinated contract Covid still get bad develop Pulmonary fibrosis, heart failure, like. certainly doesn’t mean it’s going kill every unvaccinated person. Even delta original strain (wild type?) weren’t that. Omicron concerning doubt, panic good. No, 61, 13 confirmed omicron. Considerable new variant, 10% suppose. finished

The discussion origin important accent use say ""omicron"", haha. 

But see panic reaction countries ban traffic whatever region new variant detected first, even origin might different. botswana claims brought travellers another country.  1000%! listen watch actions. many countries immediately responded - see lack uselessness there's real shit going Well damn live Idaho drive eastern Oregon regularly. guys really great masking. Idaho know people even masks. can't over-all publicly released strategy handling COVID??

The messaging government pathetic. needs public airing over-all strategy defines end-game. piece-meal strategy identifying needs done next fails convince anyone eventually learn live virus. haha right? really think came unlucky timing, get sentiment. they're even paying attention results past lockdowns regards implementing future ones, think fair say they've stopped listening science/evidence says, serious problem. many governments behaving manner well, though they've collectively lost little sense begin with. happens refuse? still targeting spike proteins

This depends different vaccines, no? Ones use deactivated virus particles going ""use"" whatever part virus immune system responded to. It’s even bad headline Well, it’s gotta start somewhere first place identify disease beginning likely real starting point. addition, Wuhan prerequisites likely starting point regardless go lab animal market scenario. works. information, bottleneck Pfizer. think Pfizer crank billions tablets want to?

the problem compound, PF-07321332, entirely new chemical entity. supply chains literally built ground make metric tons this. people want make tablet, means, go it. they'll fighting limited supply API. think happens multiple people looking buy thing supplier? Insurance turn applying also deny coverage based procedure. Never turned something? have. ACA protects insurance can’t turn coverage preexisting conditions. Same, buy KF94s daughter fit face better. 3 year old thankfully less risk are, assuming vaccinated. Every way miserable way die. found [guy told wanna hear… surely can’t wrong! Beurocracy leaving room common sense again. lawyer making decent point: ""To absurd that, someone suspected super-spreader, researcher left mix room hundreds passengers moved country, meeting consular staff lawyers."" state got peak last winter without delaying cancer treatments.   traveled domestically US. found interesting neither airports visited temperature screenings. 

Vaccines statuses required booking flying, found odd something simple temperature screening wasn’t performed. reminded dad booster Moderna vaccine got spring, except half dose. He's already four times much Moderna vaccine body booster would be. He's like ""I know that"" still budge. Shell also predicted battery cars really really hard drive extremely hard park. Optimism bad pessimism. Maybe even worse comes pandemic - far virus underestimated often overestimated. Let's see data says. stayed quarantine, instead trying run away, expecting treated better pulling stunt like wtf.  need domestic travel US, need ASAP. I’m tired selfish anti-vax nutbags holding us back. could happen hopefully does. People seem fixated idea viruses become less lethal go on, that's foregone conclusion (at least timescale would help us probably long time.)

So-- hopefully wrote happen can't depend that.  Yeah, OK governor picking wrong hill die on. Pun intended. like Spanish flu. Nah. It’s agency wide thing hard date needed done by. point dicking around requirements one vaccine going start affecting requirements vaccines. Considering main industry tourism travel bans fear new variant absolutely going hurt economy.  Don’t mean appropriate? Vaccines reduce symptoms don’t prevent.

To prevent would immunizations.

It basically means right vaccine gave 95% protection serious illness new variant might 90% protection Omicron.

Nobody really knows though it’s early tell effective is.

Although aren’t I’d get vaccinated, guarantee aren’t going die. already first detected. sequence tiny fraction samples take. course new variants fly radar Kate stop spread. Also travel restrictions lockdowns generally best slow week two.

The thing stop spread new variant even contagious competitor.  not, Covid disease slowly progresses worse, take 3 weeks symptoms hospitalization sometimes. That’s need time. articles getting insufferable point   someone get home kit test? you’re US, get CVS. found positive got PCR next day. don’t really give fuck you’re informed not. want sub. Thanks extracting it. It’s interesting many Latino descent don’t trust vaccine mainland US . good news though.  Vaccines don’t prevent reduce symptoms.

Also purpose vaccine boost immunity virus mutates mutated weaker strain.

The unvaccinated, low immune response individuals like HIV produce deadly variant. could place decent sequencing program. place Africa, really unlikely Europe, Uk, USA, Japan etc.

The difference South Africa Omicron accounts fo 99% COVID infections, everywhere someone sequencing Omicron % low even measurable. Important note also he's candidate, probability he'll elected chancellor next week.  make statement, he’s going cause huge panic. Probably proving anti vaxxers right Oof, find hard believe EU country may find strain hush hush it. see scientists raising voices. could things coincided time need say anything. Interesting. Frick US lockdown name, we’re going back since it’s like worked anyway.

I think we’ll get back masks enforced, work home so. 

Anything else cautious, wear mask, use sanitizer, around people need be.


With said, also remember Chiefs job business continue make company profitable. variants boosters pushed bottom line right direction. 

I’m anti-vaxxer I’ve got 3 shots already (all Moderna) course it’s best interest get shots arms business standpoint course health standpoint.

Also beauty MRNA adapt fly, modern medicine beautiful thing Moderna good company. I’m sorry happened :( I’m glad got back. no, wasn’t asking I’m worried getting back — it’s I’m trying figure Covid not, feel AWFUL chronically ill can’t go get tested anything lot J&amp;J vaccines. really hard compare breakthrough infections population. According Dutch law still wait three days symptoms test positive. negative test get free card isolation. 8 billion shots given around world, that’s 1 per person, something going go wrong, we’ve seen everything go wrong go wrong. People shots well healthy. People didn’t get vaccinated not. There’s complete data, it’s like asking water wet. open source science article that's published pays publisher thousands dollars. Newspapers anyone paying publish articles Making vague, baity statements clearly OK compliance perspective result affecting company’s share price. Think said vax rate like 7% Provence alone. Well we’re half way Greek alphabet right now, next December, maybe we’ll Omega variant. time also sure eradicate virus. important solutions. moving needle here. Also said LESS effective, ineffective. Omicron may take protection away though. don’t know yet.  dribble meant funny? memorized exact infection rates country side world me.

But yes, knew major HIV epidemic Africa time. Nevertheless, 1 5 still shocking. Good deal. Thanks insight! Everyone thinks protagonist aren’t gonna die. I'm doctor I'm speculating omicron bad would know now, I'm buying whole 2 weeks thing. wont get much worse suddenly 2 weeks like zombie apocalypse It’s going happen. Parliament decide, new government agree, CDU politicians well. AfD obviously vote it, clue Die Linke though Maybe, maybe not. origin (who cares!), prevalence: among 600 passengers 60 (10%!!!) positive Omicron. one asked education. OP conveyed feeling guy correcting technical irrelevance mansplaining.  luxury waiting. imperative base decisions information rather fear. waiting now; acting, either. gathering information. alternatives acting waiting. chose attempt neither react react. Facts Delete also remember vaccination rate higher city (where outbreaks often occur) areas. vax rate city likely much higher 25%. way extremely transmissable, existence quite long time. Finally! Hope balls actually pass law. Right, correct way deal medical triage restrictions unvaccinated. fully support unvaccinated people go hospital Covid getting sent tent parking lot, freeing rest hospital everyone else. Triple vaxxed people already put hospital omicron. one doubts it’s tough people. 100 years ago people tough way longer 2 years. 

I don’t understand humans become incapable hardship completely give up. 

Not trying trivialize what’s going don’t think humans beyond breaking point adds up. It’s dependent individual. lose could also change it, like everything smells like garbage, etc could also reduce training time. Chances schools remote based Moderna CEOs comments omicron causing vaccines ineffective? right, giving ELI5, idea mutations problematic. I’m saying “milder” comment might inaccurate, yes according statement article least threatening Alpha Delta. part isn’t great news, it’s two weeks spread it’s soon anyone say it’s worse yet. doesn’t indicate mild infection. posted think it’s important consider many facts possible area Omicron currently affecting. Bolsonaro antivaxxer many cities 99% adult bacfination rate square moderna said vaccine effective omicron? look risk contacting HIV unprotected sex, 50% reduction risk comforting, especially consider people likely less prone use condoms partners believe surgically immune HIV. start panic last Friday. bunch clowns. difference effect stopping transmission vs effect stopping death. America currently 59% ""far behind"". countries like Chile amazing really high vaccination rates, ae also plenty countries like Russia Afghanistan absolutely abysmal. America pretty middle road. curious think ""far behind"" saying something like additional context comes really disingenuous least misinformed ignorant me. mean entire world average 56%.... Saw post logic vaccines ""per se"" totalitarianism / told government. weird logic military, literally told government. study wonder strong-willed resistance actually is. I'm sure there's even smaller percentage never budge. certain others vaccinating herd mentality fold get effects lives livelihoods enough. 

Nothing like losing job homeschool kids snap back reality make question whether ***truly*** believe lies. didn’t know thing. see valid reason get circumcised, HIV nowadays refer positive tests, often delivered asymptomatic people. biggest cheerleader vaccines still urge people get them. getting booster last week, completely leveled 36 hours, trigger another Shingles outbreak eye/face, mild myocarditis, hearing news - let's say first line go get new shots anymore. can't keep immune system.  basically federal army whose service offered states actively bound federal operations? still federal army federal control, governance regulations granted access states then. still fail see step demand authority regulate it. like parents letting drive car turn around demanding able install spoiler new rims liking? 90-day wait thing longer true, unless received monoclonal antibodies.

Feel bro. 24/7 sirens solid month. escape wails unless noise cancelling cans music 11. Depressing hell. Regeneron monoclonal antibody treatment. Seems like would straightforward re-engineer antibodies someone infected Omicron. anything existing doses would think could switch production fairly short order. is. found cases weeks ago Netherlands, variant even named. (After sequencing suspect cases.) Yeah you’re absolutely right. Guess hoping someone link something science addressed particular situation.

But thank reply. wouldn’t want anyone thinking random redditors good source medical advice definitely don’t want comment feeding misinformation machine. little goddam late buddy.  Fig 1 paper little busy, sections A, B, C give decent illustration - binding concentration dependent binding depends probability spike antibody touching - touching mutual orientation allows binding (The ""On"" rate) also ""Off"" rate, probability spike antibody dissociate *and re-bind*. rate less 'constant', rate variable - lower rate better binder. rate determined combined strength interactions residues make overall interaction.

Complete hypothetical incoming - 

Say spot (epitope) spike presents valine, phenylalanine, arginine, glutamine. antibody match might bind well mixture of:

1) salt bridge arginine (let's give antibody glutamic acid)

2) cation-pi binding phenylalanine (antibody gets lysine)

3) let's finish things leucine gap fill, might also get us Van der Waals Spike's valine.

With multiple residues interacting multiple residues, changing *single* residues (evolution one time mutation rates high) produce weaker still viable interactions.

So, interaction starts 1 nM (very good natural antibody) virus mutates arginine lysine - antibody glutamic acid may able reach form salt bridge, overall surface (including interactions 2 3) still compatible (let's call 30 nM). Change valine another phenylalanine though, interaction may broken sterics, phenylalanine able physically block things outright (1500 nM). Yeah I’m locking save unvaccinated they’ve plenty opportunities save themselves. lot political pressure applied ETS gets them, hope right thing. Omg wait pulled neck muscle getting vaccinated too?!?! 

I mean think got laying resting much stretched weird position. kink neck maybe four days only. random happened people! 😝  Valid point missed. would assume lack people taking public transport would also work favour It’s Sunday night brawl Moderna Pfizer fight death conflicting information ya’ll! I’m basically situation. I’m waiting get 3rd shot late December, 90-days post infection. choosing 90-days amount time CDC said don’t need tested testing positive. figured due natural immunity time. Thanks tip. agree multivalent vaccines make perfect sense theory. guess they're concerned interrupting current manufacturing process we're still trying vaccinate world, switching multivalent vaccine would seem like good move long run. Much easier convince vaccinated people get boosters antivax get vaccinated. boosters happen make difference omicron recommendation going huge positive. Otherwise antivax continue antivax… point aren’t many people fence. antivax strong opinions…. however quite people fence boosters too. watched knew going bad. told people work started wearing masks long anyone else roundly mocked. weeks later everyone wearing masks. spreads easily Delta containing almost impossible. That's there's placebo arm. everyone subject NPI's, relative risk factor comparisons more-or-less hold up. scale completely linearly NPI's change, real-world data show hugely divergent. Huh, ok guess. misleading ne then. Something national name would figured federal body.  [Not current ones mRNA inserting gene spike proteins adenovirus.  

So it’s still aiming spike protein, differently. mRNA vaccines send messenger RNA spike protein.   lost 100% taste smell outset. days, taste largely came back, sense smell coming back gradually, it’s month half since crud. Weirdly, largely smell fine point, certain scents can’t smell. Stuff like cat’s litter box burning food don’t register. things smell come loud clear. play devils advocate, also patients ICU thought vaccine would provide adequate protection well.

But please consider 3rd world countries communities might access vaccines like do, may able take vaccine due legitimate medical condition belief (Whatever may be).

It's question prior infection protection vs vaccination protection. Guard somewhat special thing. Unless unit federalized (called federal control) governor state unit based commander-in-chief. Still, part DoD follow normal federal rules, bound fail, thread something OK Gov could cite here.  Yes chances random tourists infected place early stage exponential growth widespread transmission several times pretty slim. Either Omicron transmissible, several superspreader events long incubation period pre-symptomatic transmission somehow detected pcr early stages incubation period. think much push-back conservatives early on, become political proxy war many.

Conservative media propping ""outrage"" boosters quite time. think anything Biden democrats want immediately bad boosters another government overreach. drives crazy people eat stuff up. 

People need stop taking medical advice version ""news"" social media go ask doctor vaccine/booster. people whose immune system work well ours, even vaccinated - need us protect them. idiot. keeping mouth shut know more. imbiciles statement going single handedly drive panic, fear, increase vaccine hesitancy.

Colossal moron. would consider protective enough keep people hospital?   Dutch website reporting Dutch news Dutch context. would that? lot differences explained population density. Belgium small state quite high population density (380/km\^2), even Europe. densely populated province Canada Prince Edward Island 25/km\^2. provinces fraction even that.

Additionally urban areas Europe much densely packed. Brussels dense city all, European standards, sports healthy 7'400/km\^2 (city proper). Quebec City Montreal around 1'000-1'1000/km\^2. Vancouver, densely populated city Canada clocks ""only"" 5'400/km\^2. comparison, Paris 20'000/km\^2  Plus, we're getting 'vaccines may work omicron' message time they're saying vast majority serious cases un-vaccinated. hospitalized actually infected omicron, vaccines offer reasonable amount protection.

Something else occurred - would interesting know much overlap HIV either know treated/those vaccinated/those hospital. Give kid ice cream Shut experience day 1 3rd vax: awful. stay bed. Day 2: felt bad, good enough work. Side effects lingered couple weeks, annoying anything else. 

Other people know good go within 24 hours shot 3. different anybody. National Guard officially militia owned state. difference going NG actual federal controlled military branches. start rolling next week Constitution outlaw vaccine mandates? George Washington instituted vaccine mandate himself. think misunderstanding actually Constitution Germany, wait February appointment. seem like Mutation might outsmart vaccine.  Circumcision iirc recommended male hygiene difficult, deep rural Africa ancient Middle East. definitely check doctor, one Reddit give information. say understanding shouldn’t get vaccine within 90 days positive test, least that’s grandparents positive. doctor would able access individual situation, don’t one, medical professional wherever going get vaccine would answers. elderly catch Covid early

I know meant phrase still sounds bit morbid 😂 Moderna Pfizer says ka-ching thanks! It’s annual potato carnival. 

The headdresses amazing, somewhat heavy. bear might teddy. don’t tired appetite hospitalization, severe organ injury, loss limbs death .

So I’m fine making adjustments continue living healthy life. Think time manufacture priority.... back steps, elderly immunocompromised priority live long enough indoctrinate next generation. Interesting. 

This beside point, work guy recently foreskin removed late 30’s. condition opening foreskin restricted wouldn’t retract. Caused lot pain. Delta beaten comers. Maybe many Omicron cases because, head-to-head showdown, Delta beats Omicron, too?

(Also -- want Delta winner? think do, right???) circumcised 4, lead sorts issues, still get blistering line scar tissue lot discomfort sexually active. hospital treatment also triggered eating disorder still 3 decades later.

I hate done me. analogy explain actual mechanism bonding antibodies virus, hence uncertainty. may imagine many keys (antibodies, like crowd them) trying bond virus, may force way (actually bond even binding perfect). Basically volunteer nurses like world war 1 wealthy women weeks training non medical patient care. Keep mind guy vaccine salesman.  Good. reason happening though. Hillbillies state think that. Pun intended? worried vaccine would cause troubles? Myocarditis? highest risk .003%. Pretty low odds Covid infection 16x likely develop it.

If lingering effects year ago, think second infection would body? Talk doctor. Talk risk:reward ratio. sounds like would better protecting unfettered reinfection. told year telling get wary government overreach. get points touting vaccines explaining slowly crayons can't win voters dead. Oh man can't believe nobody ever thought try educating sub-saharan Africa before. Good thing we've got case now. know, still absurdly high dont get wrong. positive side rapid growth seemed stop

But yeah 22k still way much School outbreaks easiest control. No, point. Making generic forbidden, except extremely poor countries, include manufacture Active Principle. ones invented pharmaceutical drug. Intelectual Propierty PF-07321332.

Latest TRIPS Council meeting WTO showed Biden admin nothing push waiver talk action. going trouble double masking go get half mask respirator. I've seeing shelves again. Plus never actually touch filter media trapped inside internal parts. Even better easier breath even cloth masks. No, fairly certain causal relationship, correlation. Educating people areas rampant HIV infections get far. *should* give risk areas access prep, 50% reduction circumcision helpful currently. Selfish pricks. [Link data OPs Add one list benefits Huh. TIL. Thank linking research! Obviously makers vaccines say that. Let’s wait official confirmation maybe? Here's good place start.  Dude used hypothetical said ""it could drop 75%"" demonstrate point CEOs right saying mutually exclusive things. 

It's comical can't figure taking hypothetical statement arguing numbers.  I’m still little worried. antigens (specially vaccines like Pfizer Moderna) centered around spike protein many mutations omikron variant.

[Vermont released hospilization rates per 100k based vaccination booster status announced weekly press conference, slide posted one Vermont’s premier journalists directly got slide Department Health. 

The hospitalization rates November are:

Not Fully Vaccinated: 81 per 100k
Fully Vaccinated Boosted: 18 per 100k
Fully Vaccinated &amp; Boosted: 6 per 100k

That makes boosted person 13.5 times less likely end hospital vs. fully vaccinated person, 3 times less likely end hospital vs. fully vaccinated boosted person. also makes fully vaccinated boosted person 4.5 times less likely end hospital vs. fully vaccinated person. 

I’ve never seen data broken like before. excited see efficacy boosters Vermont. Considering Moderna's comments tanking stock market right now, I'm going side Pfizer one. Keep things calm ACTUAL data stop flapping gums. like asking barber need haircut ? kidney stone years ago. Unbearable pain. went ER, triaged instantly, IV pain medication within 5 minutes. seen two docs, ultrasound, got blood checkup stayed observation day. sent home prescription number call follow-up issues.

My friend NY comparable job, comparable house, ends comparable take home pay said done. No? Maybe judge entire state probably never set foot one nasty stereotype? still waiting? says testing proceß flights working. One strong possibility vaccines lose sterilizing immunity (you catch transmit virus) retain protective immunity (T B cells still work adjust within days infection). delayed dose would really improve level B cells.

It also possible antibody neutralization ""only"" reduced 30-fold, booster dose create enough antibodies block quickly fight infection.

Delta hard stop forget easy stop every pre-delta variant. Omicron looks spread similarly original covid. single vaccine dose halted OG covid tracks; three doses could maybe even large antigen change. look spread South Africa (absurdly rapid) environment herd immunity Delta huge wave infections minimal vaccinations. That's environment want copy.  So... Oklahomans general? How'd turn out? doesn’t transmissible delta evade delta immunity. let teen go school try normal social life. risk kids incredibly small, keeping teen home day tangible negative effects. ""Yes. variant causes less severe disease transmissible human human would overtake Delta new dominant strain circulation. However, variants continue pop amongst subpopulations unvaccinated also immunosuppressed immunocompromised co-infections. vital vaccination campaigns build momentum especially places like Sub-Saharan Africa, HIV Hepatitis C also widely prevalent.""

Unvaccinated 2.4 times chance becoming seriously sick original strain  reason response makes feel less weird giving immune system pep talk every time lymph nodes feel little tender. Exactly. also great way natural selection. Idk that’s good news considering percentage world unvaccinated saying?

Infection plus vaccination vs prior infection alone different matter. 

I apologize misunderstanding. I'm strictly trying evaluate whether prior infection provides lesser, equal, better protection vaccination (Never infected). 

According case study (Which **is not** peer evaluated), results suggestion someone vaccinated successfully fought COVID could better immunity someone fully vaccinated never infected. interesting think about, alas may never fully know governments favor pushing vaccine (Which bad thing), tends hinder research matter. anyone, there's definitely people gladly take orders from. Sounds like me.

Got J&amp;J way back April Delta really thought. point I'm kinda surprised mentioned people got J&amp;J get revaccinated, even Pfizer Moderna decrease efficacy J&amp;J effectively worse. everything rosy: problems begin risk recovering tested. data show risk recovering infection twice high delta, rate infection 1.3 times rate infection delta.

Wow, sounds kinda bad? fan commenter’s comment either say vaxxed significantly less likely become infected spread covid. infected, virus contagious less days unvaxxed. Well, think sounds good time sounds bad. preliminary can't quite sure much stuff, part two dose vaccination considered fully vaccinated may Omicron even prey people without booster sounds quite doubtful, need wait precise data. believe Myu variant well   loud croud, dumb anti-vaxxers minority country. seen 2.4 times risk serious illness sources. would wait better translation getting worried that.

Thank you. $2,000/month \*and\* $7,000 deductable. feel - that's terrible. way headline written gave nostalgia feeling early March 2020 US could still count total Covid cases fingers likely New York checking two airports here. seems bloody obvious, 1) people want travel; 2) travel makes lot money, sometimes majority country's GDP countries like Seychelles. ""No travel anywhere unless absolutely necessary"" fell list non-vaccine interventions pretty quickly. activate entire Oklahoma guard, vaccinate send home month.  $7000 deductible 😞  Placing bets state hits It’s still early days course infections. I’ve read many accounts people felt like mild cold intubated around 2-3 week mark. We’ll watch time really know anything cases, even 2 cases won’t large enough sample size draw real conclusions Yeah, would love to, somehow let us Canada yet. yep, read definitely seems case! could convince insane brother get vaccinated man. Fucking hell.  vaccines lower risk person catching covid first place, means less likely contact covid+ person around fully vaccinated people. spending lot time long leg flight better everyone vaccinated.

T Waves outer boro. depends neighborhood. feet get wet wear raincoat, I'll still put raining. long vaccines effective lower protection yes Omicron compete. Top federal health officials said Tuesday expanding surveillance program largest U.S. airports part sprawling effort identify contain could first cases Omicron coronavirus variant United States.

Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky, Centers Disease Control Prevention director, said White House news conference pandemic agency “actively looking” variant found case far among many positive virus samples sequenced around nation week. Cases Delta variant, drove devastating summer surge, still make 99.9 percent samples.

Four international airports — New York, Atlanta, Newark San Francisco — would enhance screening search possible Omicron cases. “This program allows increased Covid testing specific international arrivals, increasing capacity identify Covid-19 arrival United States,” said.

When asked whether President Biden planned consider tightening recently relaxed restrictions travel United States Canada given Omicron variant, White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, told reporters separately Tuesday decisions would based recommendations president’s medical advisers. said advisers recommended new restrictions. Similar ratio US. Yes US considers people fully vaccinated original two shots, article states booster needed meet protection used precaution warranted haven’t booster. 

Everyone get booster eligible.

It also sounds like breakthrough infections higher. risk serious disease goes significantly booster vaccination wearing mask vaccination higher potential spread disease faster. precautions needed help reduce stress hospitals. 

On top prepare supply issues due global effect disease have. world received booster even second shot. NBC News writer: ""We thought, know, added levity might help raise people's spirits! 🤷🏻‍♀️"" guy, upgrades daily thing industry... curious handled regards vaccines... (Pfizer/Moderna/AZ) vaccines today exactly year ago first introduced upgrades far take better care variants improve based findings? upgrades go whole approval process things changed easily? ""the chance reinfection recovered covid patients twice high"" Hope holds up. Fuck. incorrect. 13-year-old got first mid May- approved 12- 15 year olds May 10th. past 6 months initial dose. 

For 16-18, December last year. Wait three seconds. also guy said make vaccines mandatory. big deal  weird me. Every adult know got boosted within couple weeks becoming eligible. Possibly either risk factors (lots older immune compromised family) - work public crowded workplace. None us complacent covid. really good news. Mmmm maybe simple that? mean, countries much lower vaccine rate European ones. 5 days ago sounded like we'd right back March 2020. oh im sure can, like view healthcare system utopian bliss issues. hell cant even go walk clinic completely full capacity al time now. Well, seems two shots enough vs. Omicron infection. Goes line cases known right now, many double vaxxed.  Well shit! 🤷‍♀️

You’re saying may allow bypass 6 month mark get booster tad sooner? First one shot, two. Every media sources claimed shots “very effective”. need boosters. I’m anti-vax many shots willing take? One every time there’s new variant? Requiring boosters causes people haven’t become vaccinated double getting vaccinated. still get spread Covid whether vaccinated not. also still need wear masks regardless vaccination status. someone didn’t get vaccinated 2 shots, would change mind boosters required? Truly curious thought process. I'd guess models show countries likely cases. show voters anyway. Wall Street Journal reported today FDA could recommend boosters 16 17year olds next week biontech/pfizer. get live vaccine. risk recovering

Any native hebrew speakers able speak correct translation phrase is? seem make sense way Google done it. baby last 3-4 months immunosuppressed. It’s fucking wonderful news true.  vaccines 1.4 / 2.4 = 58,3% effective, calculation wrong? Oh great, thanks! know something don’t know yet. Also another “right US market close” news drop? everyday happens theory gets stronger (they slow dripping bad news avoid market panic, huge drop) NBD? guess environment hosts antibodies, ability evade antibodies makes variant competitive; however, Omicron also mutations made previous variants transmissible, ie. better docking ACE2 receptors. Thus hard say degree increased transmissibility due former latter. Pfizer applied approval 16-17 year-olds. word yet FDA meet discuss it. 2.4 times likely cause serious illness unvaxxed original covid. Delta already 2 times likely original covid, 40% likely cause serious illness unvaxxed Delta. pointed out, stat included anyone 2 doses unvaxxed camp. Ok vaccines work capacity it’s super duper contagious. aren’t vaccinated… you’re idiot. nuts thinking that. They’re likely believe variant made lab get people boosted “not stupid fall it.” long second shot less 6 months ago, fine (if read data correctly). comment anything talking about? Anti-vaxxers welcome here. welcome anywhere 😂 outdoor dining allowed.

Unfortunately, location-dependent. Might fine wherever live, live, cold, snowy shitty outdoors next five months, really option. I’ve trying stay positive believe vaccinations mask wearing least protect myself, starting seem like never end none escape unscathed. 

I got booster soon eligible still wear quality masks indoors—despite looks get people. unclear that's compared rate Delta *now* (in populations many people recently infected Delta specific immunity), rate Delta fresh population. Like lots people Delta South Africa, previous Delta infection confers less immunity Omicron Delta, even Omicron infectious vacuum, it'd significantly infectious population. Deserve want ""tired it"" doesnt mean shit virus. simply IS. Dutch report 100% (or near 100%) Delta. no, that's case throwing supply limiting issue poor countries. Like, SA, omicron originated, sub-30% vaccination rate, tons supply. [Not even week ago, asked delay shipment much think there's going ton vaccines sent South Africa that's getting thrown away people take it. rest world can't get vaccinated? Get fucked, guess?  due respect, understand that's main takeaway here.

If data holds, vaccine makes COVID mild disease, 90% efficacy. Omicron causes severe illness 3% cases (hypothetical sake argument), vaccine reduces risk severe disease 0.3%, slightly higher IFR flu.

And vaccine show remarkable durability face unexpectedly abrupt mutations, because, frankly, vaccines badasses.

Get vaccinated, get boosted, wear mask decent human, live life. use argument literally restrictions?

Yes, could, right. Eradication Covid never going happen means. absolute certainty, gonna happen. reduced chance infection means delayed infection something around forever, Covid absolutely be, like hundred viruses infect humans.

So thing behavioral restrictions slow spread, stop it. That's useful hospitals overwhelmed. countries currently experiencing outbreak, thinking restrictions prevent happening, dreaming. They're buying weeks, most.


Note argument *not* apply vaccines treatments. Unlike masks, travel bans, lockdowns, things delay inevitable infection, reduce severity occurs. directly save lives, *and* help hospitals, even long time spans.

Immunity prior infection also second category, even vaccine hesitancy lost, severity Covid world diminish time. people need realize can't ""stop spread,"" *can* reduce negative effects spread public health, one day another cold. That’s made math lmao. 600 people get common cold, many die? 600,000 get common cold many die? 600,000,000 get common cold many die? less severe illnesses fatalities don’t scale infected. communicates fact vaccine requires three doses fully vaccinated. Why? seems worse everyone boosted.  Considering vaccination rates, we're going run greek letters.  guess data SA, I’m thinking much say boosters 30% vaccinated Why? Baking factory shipping stores ensures consistency quality. vaxxed without booster it’s 2.5x dangerous delta? BRB, scheduling booster  difference is, people want take chances virus rather restrictions link says 95 countries receiving generic licenses, Argentina one excluded. must something going government Pfizer.

I remember reading countries refused extend Pfizer's request indemnification vaccines. reason guys get future deals Pfizer? mean must something specific country lots countries getting deals.  That's encouraging! approved. elderly compromised, might trouble. New Jersey. used wrong twice. meant lump moderna pfizer, right. April May me. texted wife *Time boosters boobear* Feel little silly get injected three weekly stay alive due cancer. Needless say roll eyes ~700-800 deaths day week, deaths hundreds every day weeks that. city shuttered silent except ambulance sirens 24/7.  
 
This spring 2020 almost tests available one knew much anything disease treat it. hiding apartments wondering whether we’d already exposed, whether would place hospital us got sick. horrible time. hope nowhere else ever covid spike like that. would agree said, like pfizer, moderna mrna vaccine, likelihood effectiveness higher other, especially since deemed better pfizer delta really ""booster"", third initial dose get full immunity, know. countries need get board Yeah FREEDUM go bankrupt sprain ankle? feel huh (/s) Twice number breakthrough infections amongst fully vaccinated pfizer, and, IMO, likely lethal Delta. Also, 30% transmissible Delta. bad news expected guess, confirmed gut check. 

Could worse, it’s definitely looking way uglier vaccines unvaccinated now. bet AZ, JJ, Sink, etc… absolutely stink now. people have, continue have, responsibility take extra steps keep safe rest population. 

You really believe children 5 take extra precautions themselves? I'm glad hear ""ZERO sympathy"" children. Omicron could good thing! 
 
Early reports symptoms aggressive new Covid strain Omicron ""mild,”. 
 Israel, one doctor told Haaretz that, “if continues way, might relatively mild illness compared Delta variant.”"" 
 
If holds true, many could get Omicron version covid, gain degree immunity, never suffer serious enough symptoms require hospitalization. 
 
This would similar giving many unvaxed people vaccine. 
 
It's yet sure thing, know sure weeks.

We’re already figuring number environmental things would help like better ventilation air filters, much like Pandemic 1918, changes could also big part getting back normal without masks distancing. Went get flu shot today (already got booster), pharmacy Pfizer boosters. Hopefully recent news means people getting boosters now.   Bring yet another epidemic unvaccinated. Every time say vaccine good current variant smile laugh idiots. New York. believe come Europe. Netherlands UK close relationships South Africa. nov 30, japan accepts residents.

before (from nov 8 till nov 30), businesspeople students allowed enter completed complicated procedure (only 17 got visa issued 350,000 waiting enter) chance federal level. Mutations likely affected. antivirals prevent serious illness another direction. dependent antibodies t/b cell response. prevent virus using essential building blocks needs spread. 

It's quite literally like outflanking enemy. good news. hope pfizer's data holds up. Even 50% would great. Google translate ""unvaccinated"" reference also vaccinated two doses entitled booster yet vaccinated therefore protection insufficient.

I interpret mean outcomes similar unboosted cohort unvaccinated cohort. Yep sure. I’m quite grateful network doctors managing conditions. I’m used process them, sometimes reading medical studies asking treatment options see experience think it’s right me.

The world off-label medications really fascinating controversial. much go there’s lots great articles written subject. correct, bad. news mixed. given mutations severe, vaccines still great good thing.  Guess I'm getting booster weekend sample size make clickbait certainly good news either. anyone looked fluvoxamine yet this? never heard credible study negative perspective significant financial windfall associated gives concern widely discussed. Yup got 6/3 vaccines more. regular shots you’d get. explained lot people didn’t even remember went got stuck. follow shots like 1/2 more. think every basic ft. jackson got peanut butter / penicillin shot, huge one ur ass. could volunteer get shot AIT (job school) us did. get way around it. unless allergic. Hell, I’m 18 keep checking still eligible. Everyone telling get booster. will! won’t let yet? really 89% stays like mutations like say should, Pfizer’s pill might really help end pandemic.  never happen lifetime Thanks. Since already got booster last month, didn’t know needed go back new recipe. even eligible another 6 months. sounds nasty. Read note.  Pfizer partner's breasts grew two cup sizes. lie. lasted three weeks.... Unfortunately lot people don’t adapt well do. I’m much same. masks distancing really don’t register anymore whatever. It’s big deal, actually like masks things like pollen, fire season, public transport flu season, etc. brother hand losing distancing such. He’s big time extrovert needs proximity people, guess, even though he’s mindful careful, truly hates it. masks feel like constant reminder things continue fucked up. 

I wish masks hadn’t politicized. eventually get point it’s personal preference anything else, especially among vaccinated, seems like we’re going tough time winding point way right now.  guess 'exhausting' weird thing hear. virus. I'll whatever need to, protect months-old baby. Masks? Ok. Booster shots? Ok. Social distancing? Ok. is. gonna do? Complain, get lax, get sick? option. good news, yes... unfortunately, turn twice severe unvaxxed, that's bad news. Many children unvaccinated, immuno-compromised people. Worse, unvaccinated become severely ill, swamp hospitals, meaning hospitals struggle treat patients. step son 14 waiting patiently able get it. 6 month timeline hits next week. Waffle cones cooked. thing. Spent 4 days heavy vertigo, sweating pools every oriface, aching every muscle. Shit sucked.  clean gutters every 6 months?

You don’t even want know… gutters house nightmare. Make sure follow Hep-A. two (or three?) dose vaccine. looooooool - I'm vaccinated, really dope mate. That's pretty much mandate without name. Yeah lot parents lockdown whole time trying protect kids. US access still getting it. enough people died. either go away natural means it’ll wipe millions more. far we’ve lucky children unaffected happens changes two year old catches it.   Even 30% effective severe illness death GREAT. drugs fight virus different direction vaccines. 

So treatments like likely 30% protection TOP vaccine protection.  

If Pfizer's pill really come 89%, antivirals much bigger deal people know/think.... 4 year old 1 year old killing waiting get vaccinated. nailed it. best way saying “facts don’t care feelings”. Virus still whether like not, get upset feelings it. Yeah booster super quick out. Indeed, waiting die (tm) time consuming part.

Ironically, went back get flu shot last month, took 2 hours pharmacist went MIA techs trying figure went…. Oh well. I’m going claim it’s going convenient every time, everyone get boosters dammit! Yikes…  Yes. Oh yes, already got mine numbers good. Sure it’s apocalyptic twice number vaccinated people infected? 30% infectious DELTA?! Likely lethal Delta, IMO. long winter/spring, sorry everyone. Proof vaccination required going movie last night, welcome step (I already making sure everyone theatre vaccinated) people worried restrictions? states counties literally nothing Delta/currwnt wave. makes think anything going change next winter/holiday wave? let's kid ourselves, US going surge winter without omicron. Brentwood, Essex. related Los Angeles... record. go free one claiming someone knowledge law disagreeable. That's real facepalm...  cares? perspective public health agenda, exactly right. argument there. comment says much.

Where things go bit janky blur agenda, imply things would help individual patient COVID specifically.

It's patient asking heart disease, remind get tetanus shot. right thing do? Yes, sure. could even rationalize it: gets tetanus, likely kill weak heart. patient asking? No.

So according Utilitarianism, right; Kantian terms, isn't. partner feel way. friends gone less back normal us don’t want risk know omicron. think sickest I’ve ever pneumonia would still count “mild” COVID case don’t want part it. doubt people re-weighed individual risk covid compared inconvenience social distancing mask wearing vaccination. wish public messaging towards ""masks mandatory we've X% testing positivity persons infected per 100k 7 day average 2 weeks, resume pass A% positivity B persons infected per 100k 7 day average."" Read response again. Delta still 100% close exactly everyone get vaccinated current vaccines - current vaccines lessen severity contracted. 

Yes, Omicron may take over, perhaps need new vaccine, like flu, knew would propably looking get updated yearly boosters anyway.  Yeah agree that. never claim China perfect, heavily dislike either side unfairly portrayed leads complete black white discussion far truth. Since almost vaccines given pharmacists now, working double volume , extra labor, prepared pharmacy.   doctors defense even tried say statement mischaracterized patients generally healthy young. media took shit ran Please, eh?

Probably could gone that. Washington post bloomburg morning. literally made up. I’m fully conceding that. That’s really argument is. issue people take face run say “see mask mandates meaningless!!

Imagine called Xi variant 🤣 especially turn worse delta, imagine conspiracies understand logic, exactly got Delta Omicron first place? Hoarding vaccines syringes India Africa remain native breeding grounds next variant? 

Maybe CDC listen instead wrong time. I'm sure reputable input mag is, claim twitter handle belongs someone involved Moderna vaccine development, happens Today, she’s thirties and, she’s publicly stated before, involved development Moderna coronavirus vaccine, injected arms tens millions people worldwide. (Input confirmed connection Moderna; she’s asked certain professional biographical information withheld due fears doxxing.) “at least protection new variant” ton meanings.

I called pediatrician office kid vaccinated days CDC/FDA announcement. still trying figure organize administering (even though knew coming - reason sat hands weeks instead proactively planning).

So instead getting appointment added waiting list told they'd get back us days.

Two three weeks later call find what's going on, heard word. told ""oh yeah, make appointment right now"".

WTF happened us getting notification?! like speciality office normally deal vaccinations. pediatrician office! I'm sure extra factors, seems like better this. 

And judging observations school there's reasonable heavy demand.

I know what's going on, seems like focus organization sliding. blame 'pandemic fatigue'.

What's criteria immunocompromised? stop playing hysteria game. exhausting psychologically damaging involved. always playing odds. wear seat belts even tough know accidents can't save us from. 

We call exterminator even though know probably can't kill every single roach house. 

So best situations, wearing mask except eating, especially might breathing directly onto someone else (like, way bathroom), increases odds. problem guy works home he's sick creates expectation others well. Honestly, getting shots booster offers better protection getting one all. third dose Moderna six month mark getting number 2. figure protected well enough before, I'd might well stick it. explained 5 year old, asked mall was.  Mandates work. Oh tabarnak  people treating mostly still want save human life ability to, matter ungrateful life may be.  I'll damned mRna vaccines far away effective vaccines people get. yearly Flu vaccine, comparison, offers around 40% protection average. insignificant number, fact Moderna vaccine especially twice effective mind-blowing.  better probably would higher paying job. reflected number, though. That's based data Vaccines also help lower rate long-covid. 

If studied virus intensity we’ve studied covid bet you’d find several others freak chance long symptoms. comes point sometimes people get dealt bad hand, doesn’t mean lock inside forever avoid it. Covid already circulating animal reservoirs, amount masking vaccines going fully eradicate risk long covid. literally true, thing shared good source, every channel talking it. 


PS: Argentina never said didn't. don’t kill won’t get Covid Unlucky you. majority western towns, cities etc major childrens hospitals. 

Children also decline much rapidly prone avoidable kind negligence/supression symptoms parents dismissing concerns home unwell. monitored watch wait thing children easily admitted. 

And honesty I'd rather bed went young child 'may' get worse, adult 10% chance survival.  depends you’re using starting point. you’re counting start restrictions United States, yes it’s 1 year 8 months. you’re counting virus first detected it’s ~23 months. published information COVID-19 January 5th, 2020. week later first case outside China.  We’ve seen much this, still harrowing article worth reading. selfishness display denial reality situation deeply saddening. really thought society better this. world's reaction South Africa's sharing information Omicron seems akin shooting messenger. see need treaty encourage information sharing.  muddied waters vaccine providers well. kept denying vaccines, others gave comers. scientist (that deals radioactive stuff) live life vigilance. little patients people can't keep task.


With problem suffer defectors slack ""reason"". getting booster **not** deprive somebody vaccine. 

Governments hoarding supplies administer boosters pretending wise way rich countries deny guilt. 

Syringes short supply many vaccines Africa receives left-overs developed countries expire (excluding S. Africa, relatively wealthy). releasing spots line get scheduled shipments plenty time administer. one actually scares enough significantly alter lifestyle avoid. Long term lung damage would suck even ultra rare amongst vaccinated I'm willing roll dice. That's kind old folk remedy upper respiratory colds general, least spread lungs. Warm salt water another one. guess kind see vague logic time dealing fairly unknown coronavirus, things like common cold also coronaviruses. exactly healing crystal levels wacko, winning strategy. Ok, again, “why don’t China raise medical expenditures share GDP Cuba’s level”, likely China’s economy doesn’t take hit since July.  get booster. Many people developing countries can't even get first shot. misinformation getting people killed needlessly. mad, could save life. need like greek doctors pretended administer placebo issue valid vaccine certificate extra cash. taking extra cash actually time administering real vaccine.

I call Win-Win situation ;) Personal experience? people desperately want dis them. military takes vaccines, give that.   people last name Mu Xi China.

Yet mu variant. I'm Michigan still AFAIK worst current outbreak country. I'd say 40% fewer wear masks. great approach. want see approach looks ground, try following r/nursing.  Yes, must collect data verify first. approved boosters saw massive spike myocarditis rates men 18-30? 16/18 members FDA vaccine panel satisfied, asking data collected good thing. I'm vaccinated wear mask protect myself, care others. quarantine, right? … RIGHT?

Off cause not, (humanity minus sane countries) decided …  Good. real estate space used housing. current Australian government also managed COVID best first world countries.

Yes mismanaged vaccine rollout (still met October deadline however) 

Yet still managed keep covid life fairly normal 2020 2021. 

A lot people love bash aussies, damn good job. far know, yet   Yeah I'm thinking brother sitting talking way he's gonna get it. tricky part gonna avoiding debate vaccine/covid (he mom listen natural news guy's podcast, paid bunch money 'Americas Frontline Doctors' get prescribed Ivermectin HCQ, there's debate there), talking legally losing battle employer.

My hope convince suck get J&amp;J vaccine save career early end issue garbage source. Nature great reference (even though news site them, journal) - one researcher early stage modeling notoriously difficult-to-model immune cell (as opposed antibodies much straightforward proteins) saying *hints* *might* evade *some* T-cell response undeclared uncertain degree. 

""T-cell immunity escape"" strong statement. Immune escape implies almost complete failure immune response - partial reduction response (which pretty much mutation extent). 

Your B-cells constantly refined challenge signals. thousands cells slightly different binding sites antigens, B-cells same. Whatever highest binding affinity amplified creates antibodies. ""best binding site"" goes away mutation, mean B cells target antigens go away: they'll find ""next best site"" (from cells *already exist*) amplify that. creates massive T-cell cascade creates massive B-cell cascade generates metric boatload antibodies. 

By definition, evades antibodies, T-cell immune escape too. definition T-cells exist exact antibody protein sticking them. mean 500 antigen site T-cells trained last infection exist. Whatever successful binding replicates. 

Most complete T-cell escape tied *active* measures parasites bacteria able basically deactivate signaling effects use. practical way virus completely escape T-cell mediated immune response change antigen surface dramatically basically completely different virus. even dramatically different flu strains show *some* (albeit minor) cross-immunization even though degree antigen difference flu strains orders magnitude greater COVID. 

In case, spike protein would need dramatically different (since mRNA viral vector vaccines create) none B cells body ""recognize"" it. spike protein still ""recognizable"" least B cells, least level generated vaccines infection (although decay time, reducing number ""sites"" detect). 

Have favorable binding sites changed? Maybe. them. body provide sites find. what’s average age covid deaths? what’s average life expectancy? number underlying conditions death? percent serious cases involve obese overweight?  add onto thought, 6 months end May anyway - may good go shot number 4 time could get booster. get extra protection holidays cold, would suggest it. Yes, every reason believe would enhance cellular immunity. That's every non-COVID vaccine works, confirmed inactivated covid vaccines. strike taking place WV one largest hospitals state. Frustratingly, it’s hospital conglomerate bought hospitals/doctors office’s southern half state. far science goes ventilation. safer 2 feet someone beach 10 feet away someone enclosed room air circulation. 

Lots people thought COVID spread droplets start pandemic, droplets heavy tend dissipate feet (hence 6 feet rule). know spreads aerosols, light travel many feet. ventilation, distance, important factor thanks eh Yea sure. family member work ED level 1 trauma center big east coast city. poor neighborhood lot volume: homeless regulars, gunshots, stabbings, alcohol drug related overdoses, etc.

In second year working there, much turnover one tenured nurses floor, despite working 1.5 years coming school right that. forget process talking duties performed really properly trained (triaging maybe?) , im sure someone auditing overseeing hospital happy risk department.  restaurants, rules ones care - take sitting wear walk around. That's got Korean BBQ past weekend 4th shot suggesting people get 3rd shot thats bit now? know it’s dangerous?  Yes correct answer Every variant far able cause breakthrough infections.

We don’t know yet overall likelihood one Delta whether vaccines less effective curtailing severe illnesses hospitalizations vaccinated. Chances still protects hospitalization death, really preventing mild infections. gotta wait official info know sure. can't move variants escape vaccines and/or natural immunity. Cuz sitting around, analogy still works, yeah body armor works, long, doesnt, sitting aournd hour eating drinking arent making much difference got 30 shots body armor. Shits gonna get through. Personally dont even care anymore, Ive got 3rd shot, willing accept ever may get, get covid, lets real, GOING get covid eventually Thats fact.. least get it, odds extremely likely favor ill good. 
As long healthcare system continues indulge willfully unvaccinated, pandemic continue. Hiding behind ""do harm"" cut anymore—harm ***is*** done every vaccinated individual ER needs hospital bed can't get one they're full irresponsible, uncaring idiots. Marginally higher like get cancer treatment hospital? see getting countries like US yet. don’t. Think anyone get screwed. 

The regular boosters highly effective aren’t going droop drastically don’t think. got second shots 3-4 weeks concern.  likely get another within 2 months booster. speculation ofcourse don’t think it’s anything worry about. Omicron virus malaysia now?  Also blameless children 16 legal dependents anti vaxxers. Kids can’t drive drugstore vaccine turn six. 100% resistant yes, yes/no resistance switch. somewhere 1% 100% time one knows falls. too! Especially wear mask gym, overall - fine mask mandates virus control.

But sheesh - way going sacrifice welfare support lockdowns simply protect unvaccinated wear mask everywhere, support even though hate it.

Unless literally doomsday variant - support measures protect unvaccinated outside mask mandates. wait, what? airbourne now? holy crap! That's kink Almost time embarrassed country. tired wearing mask? doesn’t seem like anyone super sick yet Bingo. RN’s start $20 hour raises. understanding pissed nurses, filling gaps $200 hour travel nurses straight won’t negotiate. They’ve striking almost month. Apparently surgeries getting cancelled left right care suffering many nurses fresh graduates don’t really care. It’s really sad. lot, lot nurses even doctors thinking getting field. I’ve never seen anything like it. Yes.  Meh find horrible well. Whenever someone less power you, treat well. angry politicians? get that. angry boss? Sure.

But person trying help grocery store? Fuck everyone that, bad people. also red flag relationship. girl treats waiters bad store workers person wanna around. Maybe! best friend who’s nurse also left front lines become beautician! I'm confused expect do?

Though, average age much younger west, sure yet. agree stance, means citizens obtain it. want 'zero' covid well, ain't gonna happen.... mean Biden said today too. Can’t wait another depressing lockdown  dk yet expect help, much. Delta still cases right holidays coming up. Last year late December January worst months.

By time made new vaccine Omicron could get it, going least April cases typically falling. going boosted would say cold season best time so.

We even know sure issue new vaccine it, end Delta. know several people double vaccinated sick covid recently personally got booster. wish exemptions harder.

It pretty difficult get exemption federal worker now. know people usually get religious exemptions either denied time simply got vaccinated amount paperwork worth anymore. 

Of course varies agency, agencies requiring pretty good essay seeking exemption.

Well should'nt get boosters way even Omicorp?  noticed that. It’s disconcerting professionals act like that. Maybe twitter brings worst people. kinda tbh. got second shot early mid-May, it’s scheduled tomorrow, travel holiday, didn’t want mess scheduling then. could’ve gotten booster 2-3 weeks ago, have. message certainly bungled US. scheduled 3rd dose day FDA announced open people high risk occupations, I’d glued news day awaiting decision. colleagues idea available them. much cases increase timeframe? Certainly 54 percent.  make fuck % SA infected, would never know since tested. matters % flying SA infected 

You need make argument flyers SA *so much likely* test positive general population, then.

As said, public health expert believes anywhere near 13% SA infected. Even 2% population infected borderline far data says around 13%.

The tiny amount data viewed grain salt. large (percentage-wise) fluctuations small data sets. even know eligible someone told Thanksgiving. read article saying 65+ follow up. 

The CDC straight go fuck itself. constantly change messaging. vaccinated wearing masks, you’re still wearing one booster shot, what’s end game? You’re literally never going protected Covid right now.

Zombie-ing comment, locality (CO), safer COVID May June case counts far lower currently are.

I'm 7 times higher risk interacting infected person back protection vaccination roughly same.

There definitely exists possible future case counts area dropped 10% 5% currently. would love to, need Canadian government speed process this....
but honestly, understand wait, I'd rather prefer allocation resources getting young ones vaccinated first! masks recommended public places, places US normal now. didn’t know blitz. really wonder make people things like this? arrogance fury told do, unable process what’s happening actively fight it? sort psychology explain it. would think easy right thing one same? FDA didn’t want boosters yet probably reason that.

The easiest thing would nothing early 2020 let run it’s course, tell sick go home, don’t admit hospitals collect body bags later. Pretty easy, huh? would proponent that? even know ""just case"" patients even hospital first place?  IT’S MILD! IT’S MILD! IT’S MILD! IT’S MILD! IT’S MILD! IT’S MILD! IT’S MILD!

Respectfully,
Goldman Sachs behalf Stock Market make complete asshole, lol. fact brag even worse. bankers slowing bond-purchase program, move give flexibility raise interest rates — traditional powerful tool stoking economy — prove necessary next year.

I realize copying pasting article directed personally, statement backwards. Slowing bond purchase program give Fed flexibility raise interest rates - Fed indicated going stop buying new bonds entirely begins raise rates. Fed stop, slow, bond buying moves rates upward. stopping bond buying actually slows, stokes, economy. Similarly, raising interest rates traditional powerful tool slowing economy, stoking it. 
 
The Fed planning stopping bond purchases June 2022, rates currently 0, room use rates stoke economy, time. words, Omicron creates economic slowdown, Fed traditional tools toolbox stoke economy (contrary statement implies) may pause reverse drawdown bond-buying program. true relevant article NYC, vaccine passport available.  sounds like dysfunctional organization. Personally, I'd looking book pronto. literally spent week flying back home read haha mean, duh. would insanely short incubation period did. going interesting see studies conducted airplane. much reminiscent Diamond Princess. know people denied care ""just case"" patients? people denied care see not. Never belittled anyone job, fact piss poor wages going get car morning. 

I always said, could make living wage tending bar shitty dive, I’d leave white collar world second. even care people unvaccinated? that's perfectly fine. There's much difference taking mask seated vs waiting food arrive first. doubt person replying literal.  Per CDC, get booster now. protect current dominant strain (Delta) likely provide protection new variants arise, whether that's Omicron whatever else comes up. current epidemic US Delta-based. news ya need, opinion-free Vax population equal restrictions.

But well need 100% compliance.  Look chart 2020 overlay 2021, looks nearly identical. make fuck % SA infected, would never know since tested. matters % flying SA infected far data says around 13%. realize copying pasting article directed personally, statement backwards. Slowing bond purchase program give Fed flexibility raise interest rates - Fed indicated going stop buying new bonds entirely begins raise rates. Fed stop, slow, bond buying moves rates upward. stopping bond buying actually slows, stokes, economy. Similarly, raising interest rates traditional powerful tool slowing economy, stoking it. 
 
The Fed planning stopping bond purchases June 2022, rates currently 0, room use rates stoke economy, time. words, Omicron creates economic slowdown, Fed traditional tools toolbox stoke economy (contrary statement implies) may pause reverse drawdown bond-buying program. Think we're already ""anti-intellectual"" point ""education=indoctrination"" rhetoric right. Positivity rate 20%  Great! agree well. 
Based mutations, though, appears variant deviated course mid 2020.
At point even consider still virus variant vs different strain 2 Flu As?
I read SARS CoV 2 80% similarity genome SARS CoV 1. certain percentage use depend cross immunogenicity? would issue vaccinia vs variola. Anyhow, rambling. Thanks hard work field. get see results clinical end. Well original one pretty much worldwide within 7 days travel. Omicron also worldwide now. don’t want go back lockdowns?  Imagine everyone Sweden opted herd immunity without locking everyone down. Says obese nation world covid deaths.. Brrrrrrrr indicate anything direction. cannot draw conclusions yet. reason FDA overruled? Ah want first goes bad, makes sense Nah, replaceable cog either misfortune rather foresight (Depending outlook) place career starting family, part world neutral mark. 

I brought nothing table anyone millions people could, yet took nothing away.

Not best epitaph, it’s work progress. much Omicron fear mongering? another Delta fear mongering? vaxxed get lower rate transmit lower rate, unlikely require hospitalization. vaccinated people getting Covid problem.

it's like asking ""if someone wearing seatbelt still die promoting seatbelts?"" Falkland Islands entered the... chat.  depends. consider normal? things (like remote working large swaths white collar workforce) never going go back pre-COVID normal. context, could say ""never."" hand, locale unrestricted mass gatherings back, time day day life mask required using Uber/Lyft. context, could say things basically back normal. People won’t even wear masks. 

Major Pandemic, million plus excess deaths won’t even wear mask. 

They done. Ok. Virus doesn’t care.  fact implies 13% SA infected, backed testing, wastewater surveillance, hospitalization data, etc.? NYC. Pretty much everyone wearing mask indoors, unless it’s restaurant event check vaccination status door. 

A lot outdoor masking too, suspect might it’s getting cold windy it’s actually helpful keeping warm outside. course not. think partially concern people waste time, partially concern cross group animosity (some people need site) partial concern new hires / overall team cohesion erode bad employees worse retention (a big reason people stay team player / let team down, etc.). 

100% executives cynically adept looking best interests company else. Even mandate nobody would care. I’m much smaller city Midwest we’ve mask mandate place essentially entire time. Nobody follows longer get annoyed see others following it. still since don’t want asshole, it’s completely unenforced. Another icu nurse covid land here. whole class punished kids can’t quit touching line. don’t care anymore patients live die, try tasks job well, believe trying good job. explanation lay person comprehend experiencing. talk people’s rights get vaccinated… wait till can’t get care heart attack surprise staff hospital.  that’s point. Get tired afraid it’s time vote they’ll tell they’re ones solve problems bring back good old days weren’t tired afraid.

It’s also information overload get question believe way find easier blindly subscribe side/tribe rather thinking issues critically since often best solutions include compromise sides political spectrum.  exactly got booster first day eligible.    Fortunately less permitted dishonest person get boosters whenever feel like it. 

But yeah, people feel discouraged getting booster today wow, mess public messaging is... Release virus offer poor continent vaccine? sahara sand fuck around. tendency shroud even [Canary Islands dust travels far Amazon rainforest [it's basically what's giving necessary flu shot anything covid.

The flu shot important macro perspective, bad flu seasons hospitals get close overwhelmed even normally. later turned many steps taken COVID (social distancing, reduced onsite work, limited indoor occupancy, masking, etc) basically squashed flu season, case moderate severe flu season top COVID wave, hospitals would absolutely broken many many people would died. Bro reddit scientific american I'm really buying ""stuck one.""

From article, we're talking 60 days hits clinical trials. That's easily going turn 6 months hop Walgreen's get one.

So boosted, go get booster, there's nothing lose.

Even thing hit mass availability 4 months, would surprised approve everyone immediately. Childhood vaccines often 2 3 month turn one dose next getting 4 doses course 7 8 months going problematic. mean, shoot, they've already authorized 4 shots immunocompromised worried many shots dangerous. irony Westerner (whose countries straight seized entire continent generations ago) claiming vaccine donations anything comparable Scramble Africa interview too. Either people bother reading full news articles anymore selectively quote mining without context. accusation MSM spinning irresponsible narrative backed data. Call whatever want. inform without alarmist dismissive. Unfortunately verificable system case would require coordination many countries, health systems. realistic.

Even inside US, way show verifiable vaccine proof. CDC card joke compared system Europe has. new variant even transmissible Delta, policies put place combat Delta need updated combat Omicron. happened before. went Alpha (R0 = \~4.5) Delta (R0 = \~7) policies adjusted take account. prime example CDC study July Delta outbreak Providence Town, MA. data told need recommend masking even vaccinated people.

&amp;#x200B;

The travel ban buy time collect data determine similar policy adjustments required, without using lives people data points. already outbreak occurring another part world - simply reason gamble citizens lives data points get necessary data elsewhere. thing happened two weeks ago got booster flu shot time. Swollen tender lymph node armpit. Salvador holding either. Honestly think 2026 completely back normal Bingo. Everyone chooses ignore talking mandates. all-or-nothing thing. Saying taking mask table useless sort logic saying getting vaccine useless people still end sick/hospitalized/dead. Masks -- especially cloth ones -- anywhere near 100% effective even wearing whole time indoors. make wearing one useless first place. taking mask eat. reducing chances spreading virus amount keeping get table. anything illustrates bugger whine about. yet listen people that.  Lmao mean I’m one people packed like sardines clubs weekends can’t really mad people I’d hypocrite, explaining see Masks mandatory inside SC months. Greek Xi rhyme eye me.

Source: Greek native language Singapore's dropping free covid treatment unvaccinated signal major policy tool. unvaccinated still access subsidies sources funding, one actually denied care.

It's meant small part battery measures aimed persuading ""unvaccinated choice"", include restrictions visiting public places going certain workplaces. Whether effective knows...

Thank helping us keep information /r/Coronavirus reliable!


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  Well, COVID civil virus. naturally recognizes meal time armistice never infect people eat. That's totally smart logical continue public dining usual. looking graph, would mean whole lot people immunocompromised, got Delta last full 20+ We’ve got two effective vaccines essentially reduce COVID lethality seasonal flu got vaccine, top COVID pill improves prognosis get COVID, reducing lethality.

Not sure medical breakthrough need. People get vaxxed. Ah explains anti China bias has. got rid mask suggestions vaccinated people try tempt anti-masker crowd getting vaccinated. never done away masks. extremely short sighted CDC. 

They also continue(d) advise boosters first became available thought would dissuade people already weren’t getting vaccinated getting vaccinated. rest us want boosters couldn’t get them. 

Truly asinine first two instances come mind. Bruh give person troll best case scenario ; absolutely fish brained worse Youre right, west done much good africa past. Entirely agreed. disease breaks sterilizing immunity measurable level hospitalization needs still going cause tremendous problem. Delta breakthroughs 2-dose vaccinated over-50s already around 2% CFR, hospitalization requirements several times that. Omicron even fraction severe breakthroughs/reinfections continues 5-fold rate growth, big problems soon.

We need third doses, especially older people, immediately.  Pinky Brain.  Must mild hospitalizations.   Fair point, though never really national strategy. probably could built spare capacity one location shipped patients there. 7 trillion dollars able build hospital Mars staffed AI doctors.  Got boosted week ago. wearing mask anymore. Yeah enforcement hit miss experience. Probably also depends staff. everybody happy wfh, suddenly miserable?

There additional things going like global pandemic economic uncertainty (among issues) could easily contribute this. can't believe thing changed last 2 years randomly started working home. 

As second point, seem providing loose claims ( ""a lot companies seeing"", ""in many cases becoming obvious""). articles read productivity increased. data backs assertion? need concentrate Ventilation / Air Filtration addition vaccination.

I go small office today filtration.

most people vaccinated, everyone masked, doors closed, windows closed air moving.

All rooms needed air cleaner / air filter running we'd lot safer.  Ah yes, suggesting someone simply attend concert without beginning mosh pit like suggesting hole up, isolated fear, die. Lol, Thomas McEdit, good one... since obviously 12 13 year old I'm going keep PG. read post jumping conclusions. tell edited post, redditor matter.

[This post link click that, link.

Obviously, trolling, ""gtfo bs"" Lol, Thomas McEdit, good one... since obviously 12 13 year old I'm going keep PG. read post jumping conclusions. tell edited post, redditor matter.

[This post link click that, link.

Obviously, trolling, ""gtfo bs"" quite good thing countries taking measures trying speed vaccines, maybe cause effect upon Omicron's existence even may stop bigger disaster. This. don’t understand many people forgetting “unvaccinated” includes blameless children 5. course I’ll lock 5 month old. mean bolding world make reasonable enclosed space exercise repeatedly touching tons people around middle pandemic. 

It's really asking much suggest would better go concert take risk maximum beginning entering fucking mosh pit. lmao...I'm good health, perfect. I've share things happen years nothing qualified booster. kidney stones think qualifies chronic kidney disease kidney function normal.

Still, 40's I'd assume I'm higher risk COVID complications cousin 20's (also good health) even though works public. opened everyone took care elderly/healthcare workers. cdc declared masks two weeks delta arrived There's entire States wearing masks indoors, period. live one huge room cough day?  vax-hesitant

Call really are. lot words say nothing.  divide well...and ok. still lovable being. may wrong doesn’t new varient still affect vaccinated? Booster scheduled later week. 

Nothing omicron. 
A boost get us winter gotta short trip planned New Years last 2 years. Since 90s became clear way recieve higher education saddle heaps debt. safe staffing ratios. worked east coast would take 4-6 patients PCU 8 med surg. ended quitting. Miss hospital work go back I’d need better pay, better management better ratios. totally going challenge next several years beyond. happens extra space aren’t enough new takers? sounds like countries around world practically ability catalog variants previously unseen.   Vaccination boosters variant-specific boosters basically constitute actual solution here. Unpopular opinion mask mandates COVID restrictions general full-fledged, strictly enforced lockdowns bring mobility virtually zero poor record demonstrating discernible epidemiological impact. time Zelda 100 new daily US cases today 5x weekly rate growth vs Delta, Omicron pace surpass daily Delta cases within 4-5 weeks. need boosters now, 4 weeks case numbers show problem. searched early BBC article January 2020: includes phrases ""High chance getting """"A lot people end relatively minor disease"" 

Another example assuming things would fine article Ian Jones, professor virology University Reading, said possibility spread ""minimal"" cases caught early.


That's first early article found. won’t explaining exactly wrong math, then?

Is don’t know?

Let try help out. isn’t actually anything wrong math. best assumption you’re understanding you’re reading. least hope that’s case math easy understand. 

I think you’re misinterpreting data articles saying pediatric cases increased percentage overall admissions. in, last week, 10 percent admissions children, week 20 percent admissions children. 

But isn’t said. said last week, fewer children admitted hospital week. again, reason happening areas seeing increase cases every week, course people going hospital. must infected virus hospitalized it. people become infected, hospitalized. This. can’t nurses quitting vaccine mandates provide service unvaccinated patients contained facility? It’s win  State vs federal different issue Except unvaxxed include people like 2 year old, fucking sucks. anglosphere letter pronounced ""ksai"", rather counter-intuitively. Would total mess. beat time prep healthcare system decade ago (and Obama tried). Second best time now. Build ICUs ERs put beds in, update policies procedures allow better surges.

Otherwise, going sit around keep bitching reddit everything always going overwhelm system. It'll interesting see concerned are. 
Will actually detail new symptom set omicron (if holds deeper understanding it) reported Drs South Africa???

(They never mentioned Delta slight change symptoms)

I get concern mitigation, I'm saying they're reacting reaching, different set symptoms RELEVANT bit info people need stay safe/well can. 
If throw people symptoms shift. truly concerned they? intervention time. China also able send lot staff places Wuhan. strategy work well nationwide outbreak everywhere dealing staff shortages. overweight, much America is. think first round vaccines obese. don’t think anybody advocating people stay indoors protect unvaccinated. It’s always healthcare systems. ""vaccinated folks need wear mask"" message people spreading months

Don't blame ""people"" official guidance one morning ""if vaccinated, masks optional.""

That afternoon, one wore mask anymore. Wow going travel next month (family) kinda glad that's happening. me, work anywhere hubs different. Omicron gets rolling, 15% fewer bother you, pretty soon.

In meantime, put American flag decal Prius. looks good mine. distract them.  I'm sure state federal level QLD, that's rules December 17 wards.

I'm sure smaller remote communities probably choose ignore choose to. course larger cities need it. wife got boosters flu shots couple weeks apart. swollen lymph nodes following booster flu shot. San Diego. masks there. Sorry, that’s meant imply. said articles, hospitalisations lag transmission weeks little bit know exactly going severity. Agreed, Way better mask wearing habits NYC weeks ago midwestern college town. Wobble, sure. Waver, agree. waffle? don’t know really
Applies Please remind US ever lockdown? Anybody thoughts get Morocco? dad stuck right now. Nope never lock down, stay home order order without attempt actually enforce Surveys need gtfo hospitals. feel like everything avoid bad survey results anymore.  immunocompromised 20 days. someone HIV takes anti-virals, example, likely shed longer. never impose quarantine except one plane. New York tried half ass civil agreement. someone refused sign it, health department would need get court order almost never done would need show evidence infected. never even attempted delta except paper basically ignored lots people huge level mutations makes different strain. cases far vaccinated recovered people, though mild young people. increasing case count 5-fold per week, putting pace cause surges every city world within weeks. idea mortality hospitalization rates lower, higher, original strains. likely information additional surges begin. I’m not, point. Long-lasting sterilizing immunity may reach, retain immunity severe illness such, we’re never going back square one Anecdotal worst case scenario point entire pandemic consisted series shifting goal posts. 

We effective vaccines limit risk reasonable levels. Soooo agree.... math good. 

Peachy. walk rite aid 2-3 able get booster fyi problem. China (Germany) rather kill people. People complain China caused virus spread, spreading China (and you).

I hope time (and you) can't keep up, really good vaccine meggido variant behind corner. Maybe tiered doctor also Little appetite help people point. all. point would cleaning gene pool preserving smarter voters. travel doctor make exact error advising travel plans Asia. lost confidence advice point.  omicron evades vaccine means isn’t competing Covid strains - means still get strains get omicron. get booster prevent severe illness strains there. 

If omicron competing strains means immunity others degree protect omicron. case also get booster offer least level protection. specific example, regional hospital adding new emergency wing tune $500 million. Construction recently started, wing estimated open 2026. Yes, Sheba cases contact tracing determinative great. mom’s neck woods, ~48%. Sooo thankful she’s fully vaxxed plus booster. know yet. first time new lineage spreading faster study it. Also pretty sure people Israel healthier baseline lifestyle Americans . they're screaming USA terrified . Europe announced giving boosters people 3 months second shot. I’d wait data, moment Europe’s gameplan.  Yes good point. Every hospital 200 mile radius cut retirement back 2%, raised health insurance premiums treated workers like absolute shit since COVID started. 

One local hospitals currently strike unsafe working conditions, 10% across board (medical, administrative) paycut, elimination 100% retirees retirement pay health insurance raising 6x $1800 per month. hospital responded ignoring refusing negotiate, taking heating sources away strike line, oh yeah, cancelling freaking health insurance effective immediately. 

Shockingly, nursing schools local universities can’t seem recruit people right now. can’t build hospitals medical professionals freaking done. treated badly it’s getting rapidly worse, name profits. Yes, smaller dose less side effects average. There's huge degree randomness far guarantee. comments like stabilizing markets. Trying get people panic sake stock. Somehow important life. Abbot said could detect it, really needs verified test. huge degree luck involved. One virion hits antibody mucous falls apart, one infects cell passing cell notices it, one starts infection spreads. odds change variant, since one different collection antibodies work versus useless it. (With Omicron change dramatically, though numbers yet.) Yeah know wrote, reading wrote there's that.

And went little rant percentages is...well polite....""wrong"" whatever. 3-year-old 1-year-old. live way Covid, minus stuff big, dense crowds. Keeping kids locked guarantees poor social development. Hell Europe announced fully vaccinated people get first booster 3 months 2nd shot, 6 months. Boosters could rolled much sooner messaging clear. Check title - we’re talking downstate T/B-cells extremely comprehensive view virus Omicron definitely going recognized

But immune response generated vaccines focuses spike... changed dramatically.  vaccines introduced parts virus extremely comprehensive view?

From understand operate as, ""Hey recognize spike... kill it. Hey you, see spike again, send antibodies""

Now spike different... upvote button cant omicron? Nothing truly free small downgrade. numbers effectiveness infection. Effectiveness hospitalization *after* infection seen around 90% 2-dose, 3-month gap (should significantly better 3/7 worse 2/1). largely latter values going working us here. central question whether Omicron less baseline severe Delta (which extremely deadly compared lineages) equal determiner.

Anyone 50 - ideally anyone - needs third dose get 3-dose/7-month tier protection. seems likely numbers coming out. question virulent is. severe cases cause vaccinated people? cases far? Illinois re-mandated like August compliance around 95%+ places nessecarily. Delta first sequenced Dec 2020, probably came existence months earlier that, explode India March 2021. regions months behind that. Alpha pretty similar trajectory - first sequenced September 2020, surged UK late December. take quite long time exponential growth become apparent. I’m confused. person uses account? definitely said “weird”. remember typing that? It’s still right top thread. Seriously. Go look. message thing one's going listen want in-depth discussion r/politics due polarisation vaccination status United States. spike changed much frontline t/b cells vaccination recognize all?

That’s key - *really* implausible. T/B-cells extremely comprehensive view virus Omicron definitely going recognized. Beta - last immune escape variant cause panic - 
easily recognized T/B-cells. Omicron looks like may immune evasive Beta, extent defeat cellular immunity... again, basically never happens.  mean yeah 90% eligible means 10% weren’t. work home, absolute perfect health, little interaction public technically wouldn’t eligible. Congrats perfect health!  trying help understand... I'm mistaken. hand confused said. 

Keep might start answering questions. But, Australians banned would people Tasmania. Australia. flow people back forth mainland significant impossible stop fully. 400 miles water much. go Argentina cruises …ok good thing living south area that’s highly vaccinated easy get vaccinated receive boosters. Got booster 22nd walk done within 10 minutes. wait paperwork getting booster. restrictions mostly lifted Delta/current wave right? takes lot longer 1 year 8 months build shit ton hospitals put recruiting efforts getting significantly people nursing schools. also need nursing schools. 

You’re making sound like easy solution it’s hard solution take 3-5 years even get whiff benefits from. 

So I’ll ask, help current situation? wonder it’s Michigan time. hospitals getting wrecked large number unvaccinated people taking beds. hahahaha Pfizer moderna act identically, moderna's higher dose. Stick it, change want, really matter. xd Tbh logical think France it, 3 neighbour opuntries. there's lot trafic Morocco France keeps posting nonsense articles 5 year plan. dining conserts, social settings non ever nobofy us aim for. Keep us isolated. us home. Monitor us. world fucked up! Wish part existence sometimes. Makes sad take away freedom life know it. Hi don’t understand perspective would like to. Could talk pander group? referring four patients Israel. statement specifically made israeli media, updating conditions israeli patients. Lol reaching. fun. Louisiana. think explains it.  easy get live, mall using abandoned store give shots every day. walk ask. Run county. not. I'm already grocery store get shot, essentially zero cost. 

Especially alternative serious illness death. Getting shot takes 45 seconds far cost nothing. Huh?

How “this surge seeing increase pediatric cases last surge” weird? normal? would expect anything different? mechanism spread Covid would lead lower rise pediatric cases last wave couple months ago? would expect see fewer? Help understand. Fuck me. Even case active tuberculosis outbreaks? sick politics becoming folks identity leading bullshit obsession team vs team mentality. Let’s keep people safe get back normal FUCKS SAKE. literally dozens articles like this. handful posted subreddit within last half hour. It’s getting exhausting. there’s new information, need stop making articles pretend is. beginning this, China built additional hospitals matter weeks. US spent fraction 7 trillion spend medical capacity, would much better shape. Instead gave bowling alley owners Yeah would lockdowns even cards? That’s works. High community spread one variant doesn’t equal high community spread another mixing sterilizing protective immunity - respiratory diseases absolutely same. entirely plausible lose sterilizing immunity disease spread quickly vaccinated/recovered population (as happening Johannesburg) yet high degree protective immunity breakthroughs. exactly swine flu (IFR&lt;&lt;0.1%) 2009, lesser degree flu every year. Embarrassing slow sequencing  another solution - simply exclude vaccine deniers receiving care regular system.

Whip field hospitals, staff vaccine deniers done it.

I understand move direction.

&amp;#x200B;

These people shit deny medicine works, making things worse us, desperately need it, think access it?

&amp;#x200B;

Either out. out, fine. try come work you.

&amp;#x200B;

We thin ice - rate, burning current doctors nurses - address issue, we'll worse problems covid worry about. Headlines like enable irresponsible attitudes….who give f#*k selfish shitheads selfish attitudes…we what’s best interest greater good….the post could done piece headline “Americans ready hard work make personal sacrifices necessary new omicron variant emerges” hope things turn around. last thing need combination flu covid putting people hospitals. It’s Thomas McEdit.

Your original comment include Trump.

Racism trump repeatedly dog whistling stoking anti Asian sentiment. Nothing travel ban.

Scientists predicted virus would evolve new variants would arise. repeatedly said don’t know. That’s literally saying now, can’t know observe further. Nothing even showing it’s bad severity wise. soon tell. hospitalizations South Africa, they’re sure yet that’s strain infectious (more cases = hospitalizations) it’s deadly (same # cases, hospitalizations). Also sure hospitalized cases delta omicron, that’ll known next day so. people kind people thinking ""Ohh body armor doesnt work still get wounded got shot!"" I’m putting words mouth. said weird pediatric cases surge. words. 

I’m explaining isn’t weird it’s literally outcome possible. cases increase (as Michigan), pediatric cases *must* increase well. 

Hence, weird pediatric cases increased. Honestly deal mild/asympto illness almost certain. Probably big deal. 

But confident previous infection t/b cell immunity work front line all? 

Yes recovered patients, t/b cells thing protect us eventually. run time. 

But spike changed much frontline t/b cells vaccination recognize all? insane. What's vaccination rate? You’re paranoid, you’re best keep child safe. people going make feel bad that, that’s them. would rather miss gatherings worried entire time weeks it. feel like good wake call make lots days throughout year special times loved ones rather thinking way specific dates. TLDR: Everything need know, know yet. freak out, get vaccinated already done so. still people ineligible though, one them. set lie say worked public saw cousin 20 years younger get hers, finally opened everyone. Kzi-variant sounds like Star Wars lil  know either shitty outreach. ended breakthrough case. I'm little bitter goal clear - two weeks stop spread. honestly lost mind think getting weekly booster shot trivial, let alone even monthly. Yup. Bye bye Virginia. cheap 1 bedroom apartment 1500 month 47, Ohio. stockpiles shots n boosters. one wants them. Got mine 3 weeks ago. Lockdowns pointless stage game. Get vaccinated move coronavirus - confirm Waste water analysis interesting me. graph clearly shows new spike high match earlier rise cases. Also decay Delta much slower fall cases. 

Do people shed extended period time infection? messaging start 2020 virus mild? 3.4% death rate spread like wildfire whole time. Lol wtf talking about? Stop pulling shit ass. There's even enough data know harmful is, let alone groups targets more. Delete comment. concur, Doctor.

Maybe Seattle flu study save us again. Kind reminds year long dilemma whether admit airborne status. Yeah, think lot people understand hospitals overrun ensure lockdowns happen. way around that. Even us wanted that, political it, going happen. Somehow, get pandemic control. Either hospitals, medical breakthrough, somehow another weak strain squeezes bad ones. President Biden also announce hospitals allowed admit unvaccinated patients January 1st,

Sadly, I'm almost positive authority that. effective vaccine I’ve read. seen different? They're ""taking over"". Geez. everything china malicious intentions. least they're bombing shit like America would. What's plan variant evades boosters?

Well least build resistance delta. Omnicron showing magically gonna take delta Tell everyone got vaccinated asap sucks suck wait 6 months get new omnicron booster?

Who says even get Omnicron vaccine next 4-5 months? take 3 months drop testing another 1-2 months even Force everyone keep getting boosters every months perpetuity?

As long new variants keep showing up, gonna reality while. Better prepare mentally now. Yeah sucks. Everyone knows it. Everyone it. pretty much sums up. Excelsior Pass better proof vaccination option. Excelsior Pass requires answer questions name, date birth wear vaxxed cross checks NYS database Covid 19 vaccinations. you’re boosted Pass Plus even cross checks name vax info state ID driver license. you’re going friends New Yorkers, get use Excelsior Pass Pass Plus. comparisons ""Spanish Flu"" pandemic 1918-1920.

Later found technically wasn’t supposed available yet, feel weird mixture relief guilt lol. mean, know could’ve said I’m at-risk workplace something, planned waiting since expected high demand people really need more.

Then again, can’t go mile without seeing yards trucks littered antagonistic conspiracy propaganda vaguely bitching Pelosi “sheeple” (literally), maybe there’s *not* much demand area… seen dates predicted? Genuinely curious.  Lol sorry, miscommunicated. It’s long day…. meant say exactly said lol

It unvaccinated holding everyone else hostage, politicians happy keep allowing it. Getting booster pain ass. get one without card place gave card said ""per CDC guidelines CDC give out."" crock shit CDC website states replace cards. ""As World War II continues, tired public little appetite opposing Axis.""

Geez, people babies. Normal most

Destruction others

Still waiting return work work international students

This delay another kick teeth ain't getting 'Omnicron' booster next 4-5 months. take least 3 months vaccine even drop even unless critical population age group, going eligible bit. even know Omnicron deadly right Delta still biggest threat. get booster eligible.

At point let virus run course, enough people vaccinated masking. war analogy makes sense one living ignorance. I'm fully aware pain COVID caused. I'm ignorant enough still believe we're weeks/months lockdown away different situation.  


We made vaccine. work. Adjust expectations ""post-COVID"" looks like. talking about? boosters first came get one without old risk factors. officially authorized relatively recently. longer delay getting it, therapeutics / better treatments / higher efficacy vaccines / fewest unknown long term implications have. always got hit slept first night I'm American might wrong think Biden cannot much did. made vaccines available (almost) everyone people refuse take them. work placed restrictions made vaccine mandatory. People outraged work either. 

Also giving millions vaccines around world guess what? People countries grateful got jab (in part). one point think guys need accept government cause problems, people simply part. matter Biden people refuse get vaccinated freedoms. Give lockdowns daddy 🥰  This, know handful didnt give 1 shit covid. got vax could go party continue live life without mask.

Had zero safe others. returning normal It’s illegal deny care, illegal deny coverage, Singapore doing. Yesterday, saw two families little kids getting vaccinated Duane Reade Jackson Heights. guessed Covid-19. know that. know anything. entire reason got j&amp;J dad, malicous compliance.

We never really wanted shots getting 1 really pain ass. 

At least j&amp;j ""compliant"" get 1 ouchie  No, 6 months that’s ideal interval best secondary immune response. takes time immune response mature another dose results much greater response previous.  


This won’t issue different vaccine required omicron- different vaccine. 6 mo wait.  UAE great Talk privilege Interesting. Long Island place see people Mask explicitly stated need one. like doctors reason Vet needs too. guess medical related  Imagine brainwash 8 generation.  South Africa seeing massive influx children 2. 10 day increasing 49 day admitted hospitals. still early that's scary enough numbers me. hey Pfizer Biden updated vaccine ? Dont give us thing boosters, give us updated vaccine. got boosted San Diego October walk site appointments open day long. closest pharmacies wait couple days get appointment went county site instead. one getting shot 10 minutes, ghost town. looked place can’t get appointment Dec 22nd. Demand skyrocketed here. ew really? see signs aint wearing dont even anymore think we’re forgetting SA poor vaccination rate, seen efficacy data hospitalization dead omicron. I’m agnostic it’s immune escape (for severe/hospitalization) properties. west donate opium, east colonize vaccine. article boring, offence OP article, states 6% SA 65 yo. infer old patients are, tidbit wayyy buried article time read Serious question: got Pfizer booster last month (in US). help new variant? Yeah Delta significantly worse original strain governments didn’t respond like it. 

For vaccine manufacturers instantly say they’re working Omicron version days discovered pretty telling. Especially didn’t even Delta. 

And country quickly change tune “you need booster you’re 65 condition” “everyone 16 get this” also says something. 

Governments haven’t reacted variants like now. 

I don’t think it’s panic doomsday situation, doesn’t seem good. Yup thank Lake Michigan Superior that! No, FDA guidance vaccines variants published last spring. It’s process used booster EUAs- didn’t process set boosters said follow variant guidance. Small scale immunobridging safety study that’s required. pushing booster shots, variant. don’t even know vaccine effective variant. No, hyper careful. therapy bit, afford anymore. recently started reading ""the body keeps score"" cptsd really good. definitely recommend it. worst part feel way. I'm sorry share misery. Hopefully eventually find peace. restrictions absolutely okay things start get bad. 

Do honestly need office 4 days week job home 90% well, better areas? answer no. CEO higher ups worried precious little power trips put aside time help stop spread.

Requiring masks indoor spaces also easy solution. Trader Joes near like 30% mask compliance. better. 

Vaccine mandates? Absolutely. 

But think kids need school. want restaurants survive, outdoor dining allowed. 

There things help get us things careful much stronger repercussions. Thankfully we're nearly cold Minnesota, that's sure.  catch covid working Covid Ward? updated vaccine ? 

Trump incompetent know that, vaccine pharma year. almost December would think Biden administration would focused making updated vaccines priority. 

No?

 variants keep coming hell updated vaccine?   Exactly. main issue older folks don’t generate proper response vaccines basically don’t work work “little”. 

Boosters help someone develop response waned really old folks never generating it.

Of course 3rd attempt improve don’t expect % drop much.

Also consider older folks vulnerable already. hate talk conspiracy lovers sense it’s true: folks dying “because” covid covid, meaning issues covid another one.

Singapore’s health ministry said two travellers Johannesburg tested positive Omicron coronavirus variant Sydney, transited Changi airport.

The two individuals left Johannesburg Nov. 27 Singapore Airlines flight arrived Changi day transit flight, ministry said statement. tested negative COVID-19 prior departure, added.
The ministry said travellers remained transit area Changi Airport. seven disembarked, six placed 10-day stay home notice, seventh, close contact infected individual flight, quarantined.

“Contact tracing ongoing airport staff may come transient contact cases,” ministry said.

Australian authorities said Sunday two passengers tested positive arrival Sydney fully vaccinated placed isolation.

Omicron prompted countries across globe including United States limit travel southern Africa, virus first detected. World Health Organization said carries high risk infection surges, said deaths yet linked new variant we'd also accomplished anything, since apparently catch thing multiple times. recently spent 6 hours close contact indoors (unmasked) someone tested positive COVID via PCR next day. tested negative 5 days after. credit booster.

I’m vaxed probably norm. It’s safer everyone. think eating ok without walking around wear it. sucks it’s bad  Wearing mask also great prevent inhaling ton dust cleaning cat litter vacuuming. 

It’s also great spring allergies. 

Masks stay sure. literally decides life go fun, try it. instead shift focus away vax one-time miracle cure. vaccine March isn’t giving protection was. entrenched idea get vaccine, you’re good. “Must vaxxed enter”, “vaxxed summer”. reality vaccine isn’t good enough anymore. really don’t think there’s “best” response tbh. There’s countries responded like NZ singapore don’t like Brazil Indonesia. Oh, get wrong, still even though think probably useless. correctly point out, never know, figure ""why not?"" Besides, likely annoy anti-vaxxers, honestly reason enough it. data ECDC many vaccines given J&amp;J total percentage still low. Last time check think around 10-15%?    love pointed completely bullshitting try change subject me.

Health officials measuring hospitalizations. measuring cases. Cases never go down. literally came gym. Got booster recently decided time move forward life. Bring son who's fully vaxxed well. already feel much mentally healthy. Exercise helps lot. son ones wearing mask though. country hope contain (maybe China). Travel bans help trying spread quickly impact isn’t higher.  Also one advantages healthcare centralized within NHS versus cobbled web see U.S: 50( state,tribal territory healthcare systems) additional divisions like VA, Medicare Medicaid. Makes truly coordinated effort national level extremely complicated. countries different levels either less centralization, can't think another country's system level wasteful redundant administration thst ultimately gets way actually providing healthcare. also true Lrr Omicron Persei 8 coming take planet?  taking africa bad thing?

Just watch, China make everyones lives better within 2 decades. hospital calls “Code violet” shit ton people show basically bouncers. source this? lot, knew of. pressed? Need nap? snack? understand, line thinking people it. However know data case (now overseas research still contact tracing).

e.g., someone would test positive restaurant they'd track else came positive. cases everyone table did, next table over, none two tables over... one weird case infected another table side restaurant positioned right near connected air intake.

To extent, never know, even assume 80% restaurants make difference rates numbers become exponential helps flatten curve hospitals treat effectively.

I guess question is, data protective boosters actually infection? guaranteed get covid? However mild may me? I’m really freaking out, certainly wondering canceling plans stuff ever COVID? month ago I'm expecting booster kick ass. unvaxxed take chances likely end clogging hospitals morgues

Yup. that's problem.

Apparently that's ""freedom"" days. true.

It's also worth noting mean can't happen, either.

The selective pressure transmissibility. selective pressure retaining lethality.

Therefore, entirely possible mutations increase transmissibility may occur also 'break' mechanisms disease kills. selective pressure variants, pop continue spread. work lab (now pharmaceuticals). lab hemorrhaging employees. Unlike nursing, however, one replacing retiring changing fields. Medical lab training programs closing across country. Without year clinical training, addition 2 4-year degree, can't practice laboratory medicine. people retiring quitting entering field. 

This, course, disaster lab workers screaming years, administrators care. many military people even vote San Diego? They’re almost vaccinated though. Real people dying real people missing medical care anything covid. Get butt. see YouTube vloggers Japan (with extensive environmental shots crowds like Shibuya crossing), seem mostly surgical masks.

Sequences per case probably best measurement — unless get something like sequences per case per month capture mutations time patients infected months. Sequences per capita would unfairly reflect poorly countries cases sequence. example, reports one case total Samoa, course haven’t many sequences Samoa.

As USA, largest number acknowledged cases, least reported highest raw count sequences. Could USA better? Yes. USA sequencing seem accelerating. sufficient? Probably not. USA states particular need better? Yes. instance, Oklahoma reported 3.3k sequences 660k cases 0.5% cases reported sequences. However, Texas reported 132k sequences 4.32M (yikes!) cases ~3% cases reported sequences, Texas got hit early surges sequencing really got going. Texas’ 3% rate great? No. However, Texas labs still sequencing heavily. They’re working background *way* high case rate.

I eligible.  Yeah. Exactly this. happened India first Delta variant cases showed presumption low vaccination percentage coupled major super spreading events main problem there. Lab tests using psuedovirus convalescent plasma showed vaccines nearly effective delta D614G. governments felt well protected. 

It turned wrong one anticipated amount breakthrough cases. also time vaccine antibody waning wasn’t talked all. 

They learned lesson realized variant coupled nations people waning antibodies could worse could fine, going assume “it won’t happen us” time. I'm Colorado. Governor opened boosters everyone couple weeks ago. husband got day 9 year old got first dose. This. Wet markets literally farmers' markets. wish default weren't, ""We know yet, let's act threat.""

When know, cautious know more. US announced yesterday aren’t going test it.  mean... yes, means nothing itself. Soybeans release protease inhibitors.

To knowledge one source this, data provided, repeated though fact. seeing rapid rise hospitalizations South Africa currently, makes sense given hospitalizations lag substantially behind cases. need lockdown never work, happen regardless consequences

Define temporary, lockdowns worked extremely well many parts world, including parts US. would like point specify temporary, did; said lockdowns (as original avoiding thousands COVID related deaths, mostly unvaxed, annually destroying livelihoods, allowing people lead normal life, nearly governments chose latter point, correct choice. major restrictions pandemic round two years must learn adapt virus.

On personal level, yes. societal level, believed ""yes"" earlier, maybe much anymore. consider Singapore's situation.

We 85% total, 94% eligible vaccinated coming 2 months now. yet, wave begun receding, saw hospitals ICUs fill alarming rate, least 85%. half seriously ill patients unvaccinated, vaccinated mostly vulnerable elderly (proportion vaccinated high statistically vaccinated unvaccinated). happening amidst state strict restrictions imposed even wave started. likely even somehow 100% vaccination literally impossible, healthcare system would've overloaded restrictions.

This represents sobering case study vaccines borderline miracle pandemic, cannot shoulder burden entirely own. need something bridge gap, either:

1. Satisfactory antiviral treatments
2. Calibrated natural immunity (getting enough people infected), involves flattening curve hence social restrictions long time
3. Laissez-faire natural immunity, lets virus rip population kills many vulnerable

There world, think, [the effectiveness] level . . . Delta,” Bancel told Financial Times interview company’s headquarters Cambridge, Massachusetts.

He added: “I think it’s going material drop. don’t know much need wait data. scientists I’ve talked to . . . like ‘this going good’.”

The Moderna chief executive’s comments come public health experts politicians tried strike upbeat tone ability existing vaccines confer protection Omicron.

All scientists I’ve talked to . . . like ‘this going good’
Stéphane Bancel

On Monday, Scott Gottlieb, director Pfizer former commissioner US Food Drug Administration, told CNBC: “There’s reasonable degree confidence vaccine circles [with] least three doses . . . the patient going fairly good protection variant.”

Joe Biden, US president, subsequently said Omicron “a cause concern, cause panic,” adding government’s medical experts “believe vaccines continue provide degree protection severe disease”.

However, Bancel said scientists worried 32 50 mutations Omicron variant spike protein, current vaccines focus boost human body’s immune system combat Covid-19.

Most experts thought highly mutated variant would emerge another one two years, Bancel added.

Moderna Pfizer become vaccine suppliers choice developed world due high effectiveness jabs, based messenger RNA (mRNA) technology. whiny Unfortunately always minimum timeframe things back normal. wear masks, they’re pretty ineffective. 
 
There study 300,000 participants recently found widespread use surgical masks dropped transmission rates 12%. Cloth masks, honestly see around, little effect all. 
 
I truly fence whether they’re worth inconvenience. Vaccinations certainly are. costs hour, weekend depending get strong reaction, chance severe illness hospitalization flu-like levels. 
 
Masks? don’t know. stop Covid. It’s endemic mutating faster vaccines modified. It’s there. 
 
So, stop wearing masks? Covid gone? day probably never come. when? rest lives? Another 5 years we’re mutation zeta? 
 
I wear masks, following studies, wear KN95 ones, effective, hot sweaty. 
 
I pretty sick it, given pretty modest efficacy, sure it’s worth delay inevitable. point, we’ll exposed Covid, even kids, even kids. Masks change outcome, might change outcome occurs bit. 
 
Maybe agree ditch masks vaccines available 18 months plus? 
 
My kids finally able get vaccinated, me, wanted final goalpost return normalcy.

Till something really bad arises. Translation DeepL:

The RIVM found corona variant omikron two test samples already collected Netherlands November. samples question taken GGD 19 23 November 2021. Saltro, lab performed tests, sent samples RIVM.

In special PCR test, samples showed abnormality so-called spike protein. led suspicion omikron variant involved. samples sent RIVM confirm this. November 29, two samples indeed found contain omikron variant. yet clear whether people question also southern Africa. RIVM informed GGDs samples taken. GGDs inform people concerned start source contact investigation. 

On November 26, 624 people returning South Africa tested coronavirus Schiphol Airport. these, 61 passengers received positive test result. total 14 diagnosed omikron variant. Laboratory testing found different strains omikron variant virus. means people likely infected independently, different source different location. 

Follow spread Netherlands
In coming period, several studies conducted spread omikron variant Netherlands. example, samples positive tested people return southern Africa examined various laboratories Netherlands. Also, RIVM retroactively examine samples laboratories routinely perform special PCR test showed abnormality protein. Finally, RIVM, together 31 Dutch laboratories, monitoring occurrence variants coronavirus National Germination Surveillance. 

International information exchange
Internationally, spread omikron variant closely monitored. Experts would like know soon possible. contagious pathogenic variant? well existing vaccines variant work? daily contacts experts world this. example, experts RIVM represented weekly meetings World Health Organization (WHO) ECDC (the European RIVM), special European network signals coronavirus variants exchanged daily. 

Update
The reference laboratories RIVM Erasmus MC working closely various laboratories GGDs gather information omikron variant. Tuesday, December 7, RIVM provide another update situation website. Wearing mask enter restaurant sit absolutely pointless Mozambique close links Also currently growing cases Mozambique maybe Italian another Interestingly cases growing Egypt.

Even rapid exponential growth, would take time see cases.

The COVID-19 Omicron variant detected Netherlands two flights arrived South Africa last week carrying virus, Dutch health officials said Tuesday.

At least 14 people flights Johannesburg Capetown arrived Amsterdam’s Schiphol airport Nov. 26 carrying new variant, National Institute Public Health (RIVM) said.
“We found Omicron coronavirus variant two test samples taken Nov. 19 Nov. 23,” RIVM said. “It clear yet whether people visited Southern Africa.”
The discovery Omicron sparked worries around world could resist vaccinations prolong nearly two-year-old COVID-19 pandemic.

Some 61 600 passengers South Africa flights tested positive COVID-19 went quarantine arriving last Friday.
Dutch authorities also seeking contact test 5,000 passengers travelled South Africa, Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Mozambique, Namibia Zimbabwe.

In Netherlands, tougher COVID-19 measures went effect Sunday curb record daily infection rates 20,000 ease pressure hospitals. new variant dangerous all. Thanks. I've Pfizer studies since beginning.  called 6 months day get booster August. I'm thinking next call get variant specific dose. I'm happy part this, even happy over. Football stadiums sold virtually every state country People keep saying this. way it’s looking COVID thing isn’t going away years, ever.

If Omicron defeats vaccine, we’ve reset clock something like October 2020. Since we’ve *three waves* including Delta Omicron. trend continues, don’t get this, ever.

If reason can’t return normal would overwhelm hospitals can’t develop vaccines fast enough defeat mutations need start addressing different part problem.

Yes solution may take years, solved years better never solving it. exactly every anti vaxxer going say use reason get vaxxed Get well. it’s joke 😭 (or when) really deadly pandemic comes along, we're going screwed. many people refusing believe virus real, getting batshit conspiracy theories, petulantly refusing take precautions all. get people sick this, virus care tired are.

Covid trial run crisis we're going face sometime century, we've failed miserably. concern vaccine manufacturers overstating need vaccines profit motives. get vaccinated soon possible. don’t know - anyone - variant means hospital beds/ventilators.

The original death rate great big scary thing started hospitals could slammed people would skip treatments.

With everyone learned, vaccine, amount people caught without symptoms, knowing odds variant worse - I’m sure it’s downside risk really is. makes sense would lower start. Xi helping Xi variant people define serious illness versus clinical physicians define serious illness two totally different things. probably consider pneumonia pretty serious, clinical physicians not.

Omicron obvious differentiation one particular marker previous variants. Healthcare underfunded decades provinces. can't handle much countries. free paid taxes. Yeah infected. one qb infected follow protocol exposed. Completely different situations. disagree. absolutely MSM. turn see narrative they're pushing, overarching message news stations two days. I'm consuming way want consume it, I'm simply checking see they're saying... really early know point.

As right now, evidence* suggests vaccines provide similar protection expected Delta. Biggest issue limited sample size South Africa seems infecting children higher rate *. (This hard tell significant since I've heard expected South Africa based vaccination rates. Again, I've heard, I'm sorry someone local better info. could conjecture).

In terms current vaccines fine line thread since know groups could looking (This statement current vaccines, rather current vaccines seem *largely sufficient I've heard (Many call believe T-cell response preserved Omicron excessive number mutations S2.) 

I believe call Friday current FDA licensed vaccines trials testing. Unless South Africa pseudovirus assays we're still lag. ability scale mRNA adenovirus vaccines minimal since point need good consensus sequence. spent 12 hours trying assemble consensus sequence worry making something humans. One foremost reporters field sent early powerpoint common spike mutations could work with. Vaccine manufacturers bit constrained. Get Friday lunch. lose weekend gain better immunity. article mentions WNY, basing actual article title. Huh. Hospitals overrun lockdowns really. suspect many countries follow suit. foreigner Japan, really noticed maltreatment pandemic. mask like everyone else, obey public safety measures like everyone else, I've less treated pandemic. course say white American teacher Hokkaido, can't speak everyone.

But considering pigheadedness I've seen back home masks, social distancing, public civility, blame anyone looking US Europe handled pandemic. kinda want go home either.

Say want government response. lack tests irresponsible, allowing Olympics go one worst cases government negligence ever seen. civilian response unmatched, what's carrying country pandemic. New medication developed like pills inhalations virus useful vaccines, new strain ruin effectiveness. Two weeks first mentioning Omicron. start noticing serious uptick hospitalizations. Comments like always seem top covid threads, I'm sure why. data/information almost always indeed new (in case CEO covid vaccine say thinks likely less effective omicron big deal), sentiment ""this anything new"" seems perhaps calming effect people?

Either way, information comes pushing speculation one way another indeed useful/informative. Yup, live Manhattan wear mask places doors along people see. I'm immune compromised I'm glad live high mask use. wish true - it’s actually pre market. travel bans ineffective?

That's got pretty cool, even circumstances tragic. talking pure scientific perspective. understandable, completely practical real world. Never denied PURE scientific perspective, lockdowns may better cope virus, two full years pandemic begin, people, government, society, global economies enough. 

People need certainty, lockdown provides none that. talk working home, understandably since may college degree well-paid job.. conveniently ignoring fact major % job many sectors completed on-site. (Most notably, restaurant workers, hotel workers, supply chain workers many others service industry). pays salaries lockdown? impact economy? Take US example. rounds rounds stimulus package, yoy inflation US currently stand at? Could feds afford more? 

And also conveniently ignore mental health issues; equally important physical health. would like point didn’t specify temporary, did

If even temporary lockdown isn’t sustainable, indefinite lockdown be? 

Two years pandemic, talks pure scientific perspective ignoring societal economic issues make ounce sense. isn’t fantasy world residing imagination, reality. lot different. number mutations also reliable way predict 1) immune escape 2) transmissibility 3) severity. tell likely need test things.

Some mutations particular combinations mutations could actually hinder above, including Omicron. still unknown Moderna CEO basis comments, ofc intention pump stock succeeded. Mine wasn’t 2-3 days commission 18 hours, roughly 1 work day.  mother 2 children 5, terrifying. mean mRNA that’s pretty much true. future wild. That’s true Moderna.

J&amp;J initial booster I’m sure exact dosage. win fully vaccinated 

Does still mean 2 jabs counted 'not fully vaccinated'?

Genuine question - I'm USA New York. said vaccinations won’t even matter anymore. true? course want take action make sure spread. wait deaths take action. scared influence? moderna said won’t even matter? lying simple cooperate. want go around worry people obviously know defiant prick. Everyone knows this. We're still chin deep mess. common cold versions coronavirus (~15% common colds) developed good immunity them, you’re likely severe Covid-19. could lead new types treatments Covid-19. Tldr: common cold coronavirus immunity offers cross immunity Covid-19. finally go back normal? Moderna? already prove though. became dominant strain South Africa less two weeks. “Research also shown patients presenting similar symptoms Covid-19 variants. However, particular, concerns raised rise infections young children babies.

Clear mud. Nurses, despite popular belief, human immune sorts conspiracy theories poor messaging general public susceptible to. It’s unethical push unscientific statements media sell booster shots make money  Potential potential that. media fear mongering machine back again. september. confirm suprised asked Vacc card entering bar(we us regardless)  think catching covid safe? Realistically risks catching covid (even young, healthy person) outweigh risks taking vaccine - simple balancing act taking mRNA vaccine obvious choice. US almost assuredly lock down. might see odd state try ""shelter place recommended, mandatory"" order things look dire, days shuttered buildings empty streets passed. political willingness public large follow lockdown gone. end lockdown good enforcement. someone dealt spreading fear though. people legitimately unable get vaccine loved ones vaccinated folks would totally get vaccine medically could. finally go back normal? Moderna? least Denmark known use PCR testing detects variant test is. However, know quickly check test matches known variants, go extra effort take look something new pops up. get booster no?? many fully vaccinated seem think putting mask grocery store pharmacy unreasonable request. ""I part getting vaccinated"" attitude pretty pervasive. Like automatically means never put mask again.

I'm saying wear mask time even majority time, hour they're walmart? 15 minutes they're pharmacy? Still lot resistance tiny amount mask wearing. really understand it... *It identified two test samples taken country 19 23 November, variant first reported South Africa.* 
 
*It clear whether took tests visited southern Africa.* absolutely fascinating watch real time, despite stakes could higher. understanding right, like trying nail butter even confirmed consensus sequence work yet. testing wrong sequences, findings may slightly off, understanding correctly.

Could scientists test multiple sequences 200 see found waiting consensus sequence? think variants come non vaxxed? I’m supposed get mine tomorrow. shouldn’t?? today - BBC live requirement fully vaxxed enter Japan? Japanese Rules that? wife afraid mRNA vaccines. persuade instance Pfizer safe?

A little backstory understand problem: wife young (&lt;30) healthy. master degree science Math. afraid covid afraid side effects complications triggered mRNA vaccines.

Please, polite factual, **do suggest divorce**, option. Sometimes good people make bad choices. make mistakes biases (sometimes false) believes.

I tried create post r/askreddit r/advice question allowed there. read Vaccine FAQ post seems outdated, e.g. says ""mRNA vaccine yet approved FDA use humans"" true anymore, right?  No, it’s not. nice try. Wait, going get sick eventually? going age high risk brackets? September 2021 COVID-19 1-2 highest cause death across age groups children. asked pharmacy day. Pharmacist says booster full six months second shot. finished July, wait til January. Sucks. Guess I’ll leave sleeve rolled next 5 years. ""tragic"" also implies lack control available involved genomic sequencing Gauteng shows almost cases omicron Promises promises. mercantilists remain suspicious donation pledges. Despite previous promises, weak donations date. Sounds right, I'm trying engage finger pointing game that's productive. look Denmark's curve versus regions similar vaccination coverage rescind mask mandates, see predictable deviation lines. Ah! Makes sense! Thanks :) tests sequenced Netherlands October November Delta. low? Good them. 6% US, I'm exactly sure trying imply here..

SA likely keep sicker children alive they're likely get sick COVID? coloring numbers, could pretty boned here? 1) quote correctly , 112 per 100k vaccinated , population, 1700 per 100k unvaccinated

2) numbers likely significant testing bias due 2G/3G regulations etc taken caution. sure getting downvoted stating facts. work retail got booster October said (this literally every news article boosters) 65s working high risk jobs eligible. never point messaging ""only 65"". would also like know Salut Lily. :)  pointing genetic causes, pretty clear photos used anabolic steroids period time life, perhaps even became infected. hard heart, liver kidneys, studies shown higher levels androgens associated severe COVID. Thanksgiving five day weekend. Greek alphabetical system: *I’m never going ~~financially~~ fundamentally recover this.*

I never look word delta way ever again. quite interesting see widespread variant proving be, longer period time would thought even couple days ago. genuinely wonder long around, kind pressure facing Delta. We're still hearing substantial number total cases, wonder it'll even capable becoming dominant strain. also leads question whether would stand benefit dominant, indeed prove less severe. really need data one prepare appropriately. know current wave Delta, see 99.9% cases sequenced Delta. even Omicron circulating long time without detected, would extremely low levels, certainly driving waves. No. Vaccines trigger natural immune response. don’t *harm* immune system, train it. Vaccines studying test. 

Stomach issues diarrhea weeks sounds like something entirely different. Stress anxiety bacterial infection. able ascribe population size difference?
Germany something like 4 times amount people, yet twice many visit SA.
What mean possible larger percentage Dutch population visit south Africa countries.
Or horribly false? whole thing arose media felt awkward calling name. masks mandatory Airport? France banned travel UK due beta variant year ago take 3 months actually tweak get approval per Moderna. however long manufacturing.

If there's real indication booster Omicron specifically needed, they'll start manufacturing alongside approval process. Pfizer Moderna indicated 100 day timeline long take initial approval first deliveries booster large quantities. That’s want want people feel helpless broken easier control. vaccinated stop worrying. Go live life. would concerning took place country high vaccination rates, too.

South Africa sitting what, 25 percent? 

If happening European countries, Omnicron would *really* concern. might yet. 

I’m going get booster allowed, I’m going overly thrilled “lock down” protect unvaccinated. Aliens. always aliens.  would need protect unvaxxed? Many already covid. Many 40. Governments health experts say still waiting data concerns actions much drastic actions taken Delta. know telling us? believe Botswana given data analyzed far, change. Moderna CEO says job description requires say. 
Is anyone expected say ""Hey folks, worries - existing vaccines work fine, need us sell shots""? 
Come on... Okay chef working Moderna know vaccines?

/s share link EU saying cases mild? recent that? know real antivaxxer you? get vaccinated unless hunt dart like rhino, seriously 15-20% US never go along vaccination ever. either get sick like cousin, caught covid July still can't drive car balance messed wears glasses can't run without losing breath. Rest family still getting vaccinated. die. That's end game people; serious illness, death, recurring mild covids get serious case. lot permanently disabled burdens healthcare system. Keep mind incentives place Moderna tbh. extremely sickening working hospital lab shit again. want cautious also want optimistic.

I idea new colleagues look like, I've literally seen top faces. doesn’t fit narrative!! must afraid like 😡 Greeks use letters surnames? What's correlation argument? 100% does. You’re naive think UK/US would ban travel quickly variant first identified Netherlands UK itself.

All shake good faith countries identify variant first disencourage transparent cooperative future. dangerous misinformation. want wash hands? 

Are lazy take measures might help people convinced this? ELI5 anyone? 3 year old can’t get vaccinated. Idgaf adults opt out, everyone forgot kids. Misinformation. lockdown period. basically head pharma company saying everyone take three doses current vaccine possibly additional doses new vaccine I’m sure he’ll create deal Omicron variant. he’s saying there’s even enough data support claim. 

What find interesting many people usually skeptical big corporations blindly believe everything they’re telling general public Covid. may right, let’s wait see. now, may wishful thinking part. pretend companies aren’t motivated profit, least partially, would naive. enough mutations worried breakthroughs also level severity moment unknown. Neither good bad hospitalization lagging indicator early say. Yeah what's interesting WI MI basically vaccination rates. 4000 cares vs 24000. people vaccinated, normal holiday season. COVID going anywhere anytime soon. 100% sure MAY less effective.. I’m unsure, however, are. case BIT reassuring hear vaccinated less severe symptoms, even account one doctor.

So we’re told take third dose protect omicron. time vaccine manufacturers saying making new booster address omicron unlike current vaccine.

So wouldn’t make sense wait new vaccine rather getting booster old vaccine? makes sense. 

I idea doctor hospital area referred to, obviously, since didn’t hear radio story did. need compare age groups. 13% hospitalisations fully vaxed necessarily bad even 25% total pop vaccinated.

I looking latest UK numbers vaxed fatalities stood lot, looks like vaxed overall higher chance death unvaxed. study 1000 vaxed 1000 unvaxed samples, 50 dead vaxed group 20 unvaxed. Vaccines don’t work actually make worse off?? Nah , vaxxed sample average 30 years older unvaxed sample. 

Remember even vax 90% effective age group, CFR pretty much exponential age. I.e. fully vaxxed 70 year old still bigger risk dying Covid unvaxed 30 year old. 

These numbers look nowhere worse delta far terms hospitalisation deaths, lets see data. pro mask restaurant employees wearing masks customers take seated ?

Err, sure would great. suggest happens? Personally, I’m 24M still unvaccinated. However, I’m really fence Covid July 2020, recently last months chest pain, trouble breathing, pains returned. 

I’ve worried adverse effects vaccine would cause, especially current troubles I’m young age. Im also deathly terrified needles also plays mix, isn’t much excuse.

Im sure get downvoted oblivion someone read unvaccinated, sharing story haven’t gotten vaccinated yet. Still wear mask everywhere go get wild looks FL occasionally lol Way evade point? You’re saying things NOTHING article. You’re making points hoping we’re tagging along you. turned ideal Plague Inc shit (ultra high infectivity, low visibility (hard detect, hard diagnose, longer incubation time), deadly first eventually lethal, easy cure) we're fucked.

Sorry don’t appear completely shocked. omicron less virulent produces effective ABs hopefully spreads immunized everyone harmful varients.  Alberta, Canada That's good question, though practical terms matter?

 countries lots immunity breaking would greatly help omicron's transmissibility.  

And even omicron less infectious delta still probably much infectious original strain spreading fine. Ugh. least hope immunity vaccines infections protect people worst. Another article morning mentioned hospitalized omnicron variant patients. Delta. Delta still remains highly infectious large threat. dramatic much LMAO useless bars restaurants. piss vaccinated, so, much cost said urine? role play pretend unvaxxed.

Oh Amsterdam Schiphol flights basically EVERYWHERE including India &amp; China 
This bad news This. I'm NY... took Covid seriously, see us implementing lockdowns. Federal money coming support one, great many small businesses would toast put another lockdown place impacts venues, bars, etc.  Regardless feelings vaccinations, would also poor precedent military set allow state state exemptions.

You sign army, follow rules. includes national guard. someone works Regulatory Affairs even vaccines tell team immense stress. can't imagine like trying submit documentation +100 countries (even same) approvals probably getting ton questions back health authorities. Fuck that. anecdotal I’ve seen opposite. Medical students eager help become doctors. lot enthusiastic starting research and/or seeing ICU. also know nursing schools seen higher tic applications enrollment.

There many many factors influencing this, go purely capitalistic, think many (consciously not) predicting labor medical field high demand short supply long time. It’ll workers market point bet banking mistreatment issues fixed time practice. 


Again anecdotal see next couple years. Matriculation/enrollment don’t mean much nurses doctors either don’t finish leave industry early hard working conditions.  they’re useless. mandates aren’t 100% effective 100% circumstances doesn’t mean they’re 0% effective. exactly goes heads people see everyone wearing one, aren't.

That want wear mask required. That’s fun part, doesn’t.

If omicron serious threat appears be, city pay restaurants shift take two weeks wait data come in. Schools switched half days in-school lunch. Businesses encouraged keep employees working home.

The city trying look like they’re something, maybe impact margins, they’re taking hard steps required situation don’t want blowback.  /r/theyknew Tell vaccinated without telling vaccinated. ""Earlier month, Pfizer said expects manufacture 180,000 treatment courses end year least 50 million courses end next year"". assume 180k change much. still good, nearly much gamechanger would desirable. really simple solution. Depending implemented, might survive court challenges, exactly easy sell convince doctors associations let treatable patients die due making poor choices. necessarily. We're still dealing smaller sample size clue vaccinated. vaccinated 6 months ago, example, that's little expected less concerning. One dose J&amp;J, also, would less concerning knowing know now.

There's still lot context we're missing make determinations. chill bit, wear mask public immediate future, get booster done so. thought conspiracy theory?Fucking insane anyone would support government shit. lol what? sources please thing happens cook chicken, straight jail Gottleib:

""There reason optimistic booster shots provide meaningful protection Omicron. South Africa, doctors describe current situation as, ""a small number fully vaccinated testing positive. minute compared unvaccinated it."" "" right president went media pushed product. less 1 month Moderna stock went 148 points.

These press releases literally making millions millions dollars. better get work already. situation germany insane right now. much bark bite... frustrating watch...

Either way, data Beta showing boosters help\* CDC FDA changing guidance regarding boosters strong reason believe would help Omicron (they tend conservative non-political sense word making decisions like Public health exclusive State’s right unless linked interstate commerce something within Federal Jurisdiction. mandate stuff Washington D.C. federal employees, although vast majority Federal employees live States, I’m sure feds power force stay home. aware precedent.

Delta stronger reason get booster. someone runs moderna Moderna said thing Delta variant still heard nothing sells vaccines thinks people buy new vaccines

Shocker censor ""cat""? That's true intention travel ban prevent cases reaching country -- *is* unrealistic. see anyone justifying basis, say want buy bit time, delay getting hit full impact. Whether country seeded 5 cases 50 cases 100 cases could make significant difference there. Going 5 100 four doublings; even it’s doubling every four days, would still slowing progression two weeks.

And couldn’t negative impact travel ban mitigated including targeted exemptions certain critical supplies personnel? see claim “partial bans don’t work”, seems premised idea you’re hoping prevent cases arriving.

It could well true reduction seeding caused travel bans disappointingly small, delays rarely exploited productively enough, advantages small offset drawbacks, even mitigations drawbacks. so, people opposed travel bans actually arguing case. instead they’re bashing straw man preventing variant arriving all, end looking less convincing. 2016-2018 used go see flavours week/month/year were.

Today, read less 25 comments giving sheer eye-rolling alone. baseline? original Wuhan variant? effective far preventing infection hospitalization death? That's optimistic mean infection. highly doubt it.

I'm agreement Moderna CEO

If still get sick enough cause long term damage extremely worrisome. ive much taco bell lately wearing mask planes bad idea, keep mind almost cabin air (up 90%) exchanged every 3-4 minutes - remaining 10% recycled HEPA filters. means chances catching plane quite low. many days covid one get booster?

Useful data! data claimed: thought interested effects individual wearing mask? stated initial comment. think countries put measures protect healthcare system anything else. Flattening curve system capacity. 

Back then, incidence severe case needing hospitalisation much higher today.  Well technically current statement Botswana government detected 4 foreign nationals entered Botswana, even true origin. country wants associated it, wonder find true origin... know freaking concerned Omicron.

At point, call morning seemed many believed vaccination still enable T-cell response Omicron. guys want good image researchers freaking omicron, check [Stanford shows positions mutations #.

Keep seeing this, SA’s backdated hospitalization #s growing exponentially. 

Crazy many times experts say “we won’t know 2 weeks” articles trying jump gun. Texas. place shithole. Beta “Amid” emergence omicron specifically “because of“ emergence omicron. Headline playing prepositions correct, purposefully alarmist (IMO) way. opinion given weight scientific institution surprise people conflate scientific fact opinion.

Please everyone... adequate! goto news www.news24.com www.enca.com. case news surrounding omicron variant, search interviews doctor first reported it, Dr. Angelique Coetzee. belief interview BBC VICE recently quite insightful. 

Other that, much report moment. Yes, numbers rising exponentially, expecting it. Omicron dangerous Delta outlets would make us believe? Honestly, still early tell. That’s good, unless live South Africa Delta probably still dominant variant area. long going take find info new variant? regimen worked exist. Lol. That’s doctors, nurses suffer burn issues everywhere. others too, local hospital looking cleaners couldn’t take anymore two years seeing sickness death everywhere (my aunt works HR knowledge). ohhh see! thanks information! misinformed thought bullshit. Thankfully, ready summer fourth shot happens mutations found several unrelated Greek letter variants, closely related anything know of. think vaccine efficacy discussion jumping gun, least terms sterilizing immunity. already know Beta strongly impact protection infection, much lesser extent severe disease. oversimplification obviously, Omicron E484 mutation Beta, plus features made Delta transmissible, plus mutations may may impact immune evasion transmissibility. 

I mean, get need data driven jump gun speculation. example, theoretical basis know whether Omicron result less severe infections. something effectively model. also much steer cell-mediated immune response impacted Omicron simulating far complex - may impacted much all, may impacted (somewhat likely), (extremely unlikely), may highly impacted. 

But *do* know antibodies bind, *do* know antibodies statistically commonly produced result vaccines terms preferential binding sites. *know* sites impacted mutations, already seen impact least one mutations antibody effectiveness (in Beta) theoretical simulation protein site bonding we're relying on. 

I think jumping gun say ""It almost certainly impact vaccine efficacy infection, need data confirm. may may impact protection severe disease, also know whether Omicron leads severe less severe disease average. research needed there.""

At point, trust theoretical predictions based overwhelming evidence. obviously different category predictive power, ask data whether bowling ball fall drop tested apple need data prove it. 

In fast-moving environment, give weight high-confidence predictions. example, delayed second dose strategy employed countries. data, knew impact efficacy (if anything, know would impact positively.. ended case).

So far Omicron nothingburger. We'll see 2 weeks. elaborate specific fears regarding side effects? That’s work research, might even pan out.

Not really. vaccines trivial update (both Moderna Pfizer also made beta delta versions, mass produce needed).

It essentially guaranteed ""pan out"" work surrounds regulatory approvals, FDA fully defined process yet.  haha, nope, crazy, cold. Also supporter Chinese strategy. stuff works. feels like strategy countries ""Shoo, shoo, go away, virus? Ah, well, guess won't."" rigorous dilligent that. Ah ok misread NY NYC thought crazy second haha worry, spammed refresh iPhones get appointment CVS fast possible, even drove 2 states get shot poor people homeless, posted getting shot IG, whatever now! 

Mosh Pits, Orgies, licking toilet seats, good, part already! 

This guy probably ""had COVID"" 4 times spread without people even noticing, part irony/danger whole thing. seems extremely hard already ""weak,"" young healthy folks might even notice it. also advocated booster moratorium holidays winter US.

They always giving advice optimizes particular individual's health.

Minimizing Omicron cases world figures deadly is, probably best course action everyone southern africa.

While case rate small, minimizing importing new cases actually really beneficial. Take grain salt, early cases detected college kids, would expect mild cases anyway. think lot people missing. Lots folks act like lockdown thing big deal life goes on.

My honor student failed multiple classes last year. scars lockdown seen drive around town spot corpses small businesses ride lost customers. global logistics network thoroughly wrecked ""everything"" shortage. government pump truckloads free money people's pockets keep afloat, we're staring barrel inflation seen since 70s. list goes on.

What would another lockdown give us? I'm ready find out. part, part ended vaccinated family. heart goes people still danger, really does, well family (to include mental emotional health) always going trump matter hard try rationalize it. reality that, basic human instinct level, people feel way, too. usual, jdorje right answer. want restrictions CT pretty much every CVS, Walgreens supermarket pharmacy attached pumping shots (new boosters) like crazy. Got mine CVS, wide open appointment times every day weeks 3 versions available.  likely, antibody-mediated immunity compromised due mutations spike protein, cell-mediated immunity still recognize infected cells.  bed spitting screaming?! people like this?

I would file refusing treatment turf front door go eat horse paste, that's happened catch bit Parlimentary debate that’s going on. Apparently Labour cabinet party yesterday evening within Westminster, mask seen. 

When challenged shadow minister replied quip Tory MP snitching invited party. questioner, fiery question, good laugh answer well. 

I think it’s bit shitty passes government (and sides absolutely guilty it): you’ve got witty quip, side’s allegation apparently sufficiently addressed that’s end it. Jacob Rees Mogg time. 

I think speaker hold task ensure difficult questions answered. Must nice live first world country obviously know already gone wife, apologize I'm redundant. say afraid mRNA vaccines specifically. Would J&amp;J, viral vector vaccine, option?

If afraid COVID, could offer framing that, effect, vaccine *is* COVID? virus contains exact RNA, also gets RNA cells make cells make spike protein. also contains RNA make rest virus too. vaccine exact thing virus, except part make virus taken out. vaccine literally carefully selected subset regular COVID infection, anyone who's afraid COVID nothing fear vaccine.

[Vaccine FAQ Part FAQ Part appointment bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Convenience. Well it’s important, primary focus regarding pandemic always wear mask indoors get tested least twice week work. that's what's going head. first I'm hearing publicly booster recommended healthy under-65s. looked. CDC website might well said ""get want to, IDK I'm doctor.""

So put signing booster positive recommendation CDC doctor - visited yesterday got positive recommendation, seems redundant.  alternate time line headline ""Unvaccinated fill SA hospitals amid predicted December surge"" would assume do, since it’s statistically likely unvaccinated person get infected. need larger scale infection virus multiply enough mutate. mutation needs host contagious. Unvaccinated people also way likely contagious.

Plus originate Africa, Africa way less vaccinated rest world.

So assume would likely. Viruses aren’t sentient can’t really change purposefully infect someone vaccinated mounting immune response. Stonks go look San Francisco right clear.  look numbers healthcare system Germany talking 1 2 doubling period delay exact position. 

In 18 - 59 age group almost half new symptomatic cases fully vaccinated people, almost 30% people requiring hospitalization fully vaccinated age group. 60 age group numbers 70% 55% respectively. Almost 50% people requiring intensive care 60 fully vaccinated well. That's definitively *not* said.

The vaccine efficacy almost certainly going reduced.

Right now, efficacy 95%+. Pfizer's CEO said would surprised dropped 70%. That's huge drop, more-or-less ""worst case"" still put us back square one.

In addition (and directly point, related whether safe ""normal"" holiday season), antiviral 90% efficacy. target spike protein basically concern work. need get people access affordable testing holidays. (Before reduce spread, catch infections early enough antiviral effective). Outside arm soreness, side effect injection, vaccine side effects also side effects Covid. *far* common Covid vaccines. Testosterone also thickens blood I’m sure isn’t good clotting issues I’m fine additional restrictions save lockdown. think would complete distasteful economically. Already bunch businesses knifes edge trying survive. 

Been keeping eye data seems you’re vaccinated, omicron won’t give serious case. omicron lethal even vaccine, yes, let’s lock down. that, way. Good luck enforcing US least 40% population going fight tooth nail. Ah yes....because imploring works well /s I’m talking conspiracy, I’m saying might want specific outcome selfish reasons. Chill   Thanks link, really drives home unique Omicron is. 

Again, know we're ""too early tell"" phase, I'm curious whether researchers feel confident yet variant ""stable"", extreme number mutations hindrance effectively reproducing long term.   want kill people! Waaaaa. Right on, sample size right small singular outbreak among group vaccinated people could skew stats portray potentially inaccurate narrative. maybe not, know yet everything new. Anyone definitively saying more/less contagious more/less virulent full shit end right solely dumb luck. suspected false positive, subsequent tests returned negative. Booster wasn’t nearly debilitating 2nd shot, still fever + aches. Headache far less time think biggest relief Lol cdc noticed reply comment, there’s even “suspected case” announced CDC Canada found dozen more? fallen behind international medical community take 4 years train nurse. takes 4 years get nursing degree, thats same. love scientists literally arms race mother nature right now

Arms race Mother Nature abject stupidity.

These mutations nearly common less people infected first place. Y'all need realize one posted headline posted article, simply followed Reddit's requirement alter article headlines. Blame NBC News bad pun. True kids low risk serious illness covid stay isolated need realize one posted headline posted article, simply followed Reddit's requirement alter article headlines. Blame NBC News bad pun. Whether not, probably stop speculating actual hard data either way? would consider hundreds thousands debt, 6+ years make decent money.  I’m unable find link webcast fda advisory committee meeting molnupiravir supposed occurring right now. anybody link know isn’t one? Thanks! completely true. 

Recognition parts virus could include hydrophobic interactions, charge charge interactions on. Part controlled degree shape determines accessibility removing interactions changes sequence cause decreased recognition. It’s shape. mean Fauci Gottlieb PR guys point. Isn’t fair say don’t know risk myocarditis booster younger men yet? safely say 4 shots (2 og vax 2 boosters) doesn’t raise risk? It’s like many years now…where been? 

FWIW people slightly milder form HIV (HIV-2) take longer develop AIDS. HIV rates high. welcome. Thank sitting home triple masked we're living lives. would put last scenario almost 0%  going back lockdown? far, word Ivermectin manufacturers Ivermectin less effective new variant (not sure would possible). training time nurses physicians huge.

Its high require high. could reduce it. ??? got booster 15th November. Pfizer here.  That's point. hospitals overrun, choice enact restrictions. high risk needing hospitalization COVID, little room everything else.  legit happened flu shots me/my kids. ""We'll send mass text"". Never came. Got pissed called back able schedule immediately.

So husband asked week prior (my son's 5yo well visit 5-11 group eligible, race EUA birthday) COVID vaccine got ""mass text"" answer? Yeah, phone pharmacies ultimately got hospital work at, first day scheduling available (the Thursday following EUA). 

Still never got mass text.  Pfizer originally CVS scheduled booster moderna I'm mix &amp; match. seem care though confirm us Ok us. Honestly, took microbiology remember thing it. Doubt would help. spend lot time cramming facts definitions forget months later. Seems like states daily AVERAGE cases exact number given day. missing something? new info modern vaccines target Spike. ones lower efficacy inactivated virus vaccines China India.

 So, there's discussion [Twitter virologists Rockefeller University experimentally created mutant Spike protein lab test immune evasion. developed Spike able evade neutralizing antibodies found plasma vaccinated well infected individuals. Omicron Spike looks *a lot* like lab construct. people concerned.

Note, experiment neutralizing antibodies. suspicion boosters (and infection+vax) produce varied immune response remain effective. Also, aspects immune system tested. Likely, we'd see symptomatic disease (if picket antibodies bypassed), probably much severe disease (as rest immune system responds). Bodily autonomy game people make personal choices themselves. Risk assessment part everyone's life. done think best you, stop trying force others things think best obviously want do. bodies, choices.  Get vaccinated. Oh, sure, data reports are, there's also head epidemiology 30 years experience making phonecall higher ups saying""this one's fucked think gonna mess"" Ya I’ll take advice someone isn’t set make millions booster sell. variant found vaxxed person mild symptoms. That’s literally point getting vaxxed.  Right- want restrictions? 

It's followed ""Time live virus"" - sounds like want...fewer restrictions? little fudge direction makes numbers appear differently.

The article says 87% hospitalizations unvaccinated, 80%. 31% province vaccinated, 20%.  went days felt like COVID well handled there. Every restaurant required proof vaccination - even ate outdoors. Everyone wearing masks went businesses. Now, could selection bias targeted upscale restaurants/shops tourists would likely visit. idea poor less touristy areas island like. Guess depends... serious shit find current vaccines protect it, excessive fine... especially I'm paying directly pocket.

(I mean seriously, American closest I've come experiencing healthcare rest modern countries... take away me!!!) speculation think lot people got new pets covid lockdowns Yeah, that's plausible.

I thinking terms percent Dutch might higher Tavel traffic SA, possible guys love travel everywhere.
As German know, basically go Mallorca Italy fair Bancel, less said back June Moderna vaccine Delta variant. 

""We remain committed studying emerging variants, generating data sharing becomes available. new data encouraging reinforce belief Moderna Covid-19 vaccine remain protective newly detected variants,” Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel said statement.""  I'm trapped house full people tested positive barely half assed quarantining thought okay ignore pandemic Thanksgiving they're vaccinated.   hard pill swallow. makes feel uncomfortable hear news coming directly CEO company producing vaccine financial interest company. getting boosted wish different go-between presenting information situations like this.  It’s also prevents North America getting absolutely clobbered Cat3-5 hurricanes every year. Hurricanes trouble forming times year dust plumes blowing across Atlantic. Local populations vast majority places receptive. SA great representative global south either honestly. applies us though, newspapers. That's way language works. chance getting Delta infection delaying booster? current vaccine effective Omicron, would reason delay getting Omicron booster top current booster. Omicron booster going available while. research Dunning-Kruger effect. Yes, it’s stop bleeding high likelihood cases omicron spreading around. spreading (albeit smaller numbers cases) weeks unchecked genomes sequenced. cat bag it’s country contain local outbreaks (if turns omicron dominates delta easily) interpretation: K K want inconvenienced, make shit told, continue efforts live, laugh, spread deadly pathogen. “Travel restrictions *may* play role *slightly* reducing spread COVID-19 place heavy burden lives livelihoods.”

The links posted earlier get details slightly reduces spread. new protein-bases vaccines run trials??? South Africa HIV positive.

Holy shit -- sure must wrong, correct. Wow. Wage garnishment, common type garnishment, process deducting money employee's monetary compensation (including salary), usually result court order. Moderna one product company - mRna covid vaccine.

Aren't diversifying also treatments stuff using mRNA well? protect Spike Proteins mutations...why wait effective BOOSTER vs one push internal profits companies???? Yup.  bring non-medical staff. would take long train lay person handle simple Covid related care, would take lot strain medical staff. *i iMmUnE sYStEm*

Not anymore.  Rather idiotic say evidence. shorted oil earlier Day???? Depends. time people leave served first course noticed. Though live Chicago people tend mask up. adults house vaccinated. kids go school good precautions don’t take unnecessary risks. 

We’re part, we’re locking anymore. again.   Gottem! haven’t got jab first variant second wont third fourth fifth. stop testing vaccines people safe couple years might consider No, vaccines. reason it’s spreading heavily NYC virus found less host last locally burning out. masks, deaths should’ve started decreasing mask mandate implemented, didn’t start vaccine 5%, 40%. makes huge difference.  KN95 club checking in. wonder many scientists talked to? “We haven’t started testing vaccine Variant need money funding testing” young children, Covid riskier flu. Much less risky activities like riding car. low vaccination rates due government incompetent acquisition distribution.
Research scientists world class though.
So mutation real government probably react lockdowns (too late)

All moot since spread internationally already might even originated South Africa first place.  Cantonal law creates weak central government. Switzerland federated US. Part fear \*outcompeting Delta\* towards becoming dominant strain.

I want much anyone over. news makes want go back bed winter. human beings want suffer help it? Duh will, gotta get vaccine bonus money. incorrect. data shows deaths group/population group. It’s noted chart. everyone focusing elders ignoring children? understand weaker chances kids vaccinated, use mask little one need close contact. 0-5 kids spreaders No, ok. time games stop, cute anymore LULZ That's correct.

South Africa first reported variant 24th November. that's case first samples variant collected. first sample reportedly collected 9th Botswana (S-A sequencing several African countries) samples later found contain Omicron collected South Africa around time too.

Meanwhile, oldest sample Netherlands dates back 19th, collection date, date sequencing completed.

So far evidence still points earliest occurrences Botswana South Africa. clear Omicon spread outside region South Africa reported existence variant 24th. 98 percent 1 50 chance die. wildly high.

Odds vaccines something like 20 times better. instead 1 50 1 1000.  Yeah, *writers* get funding, sense lab funding meant cover lab activities. journals, however, funded make money charging authors publish (lol think went way around?) charging readers access either subscriptions per-article fees. also worth noting editorial process journals farmed volunteers peer review even overhead. Healthcare worker here. 

I fucking tired. scientists literally arms race mother nature right now"" .

I'd think scientists race unvaccinated ignorance population world hell bent creating new variants, sabotaging recovery efforts extending pandemic. musically....rip delta blues I'm curious need proof vaccination? requirement guarantee everyone vaccinated, lives Germany, etc etc. person walking place would still need prove vaccinated, no? Hawaii something similar Summer.  also got booster, second dose spent 3 days head felt like would explode lying down, honestly first days fever chills, week entire body hurt, also lead multi month long flare health condition I'd control 5 years. honestly almost get booster terrible vaccine me. decided go Modena booster (I got Pfizer vaccine initially), fever 24 hours arm hurt days. Still take work, 1 day instead entire weekend taking 2 days after. Mutations virus cause adapt survive? wOw wOuLd NeVeR gUeSsEd

It's almost like got vaccinated, would real hard time mutating.... hmmmmmm...... vaccinated. studies far showing natural exposure less effective vaccinated, antibodies enough. One requires get vaccinated. 

One requires get *ill disease*. 

Both generate responses immune system, part nature.  natural. One vaccine triggered natural response. One illness triggered natural response. 

*I* don’t want get sick, I’m going stop licking doorbells eating ass. Bullish understand, emphasis boosters fear vaccine ineffective new variant? Especially benefit MRNA vaccination turnaround time modification significantly reduced, wait updated booster get shot? updated vaccine available 100 days, boosted now, still 80 days, 2.5 months earliest able get new booster, guidance 6-8mo shots holds. 

I guess argument something better nothing feel like knocking alot people eligibility box focusing boosting simply waiting week get real estimate vaccine effectiveness long would take get new booster there. Probably. thing variants, really. encoded spike protein based original Covid-19 strain essentially extinct, similar enough variants vaccinated immune systems able recognize similarity quash virus relatively quickly. said, similar enough prevent infection completely people.  Airline Industry one vaccine requirements? afraid covid afraid side effects complications triggered mRNA vaccines.

if afraid covid side effects afraid vaccine side effects needs work math skills and/or reading comprehension. surely read studies simply willing change preconceived opinion. reprioritization existing resources. make vaccines mandatory flying, mandatory trains, maybe Republicans finally show interest funding railways properly.... Africa produced major COVID variants. world's economy needs variants stop producing. supposed sarcasm... reading effects lockdowns young children. Two people tested positive coronavirus Netherlands week ago infected Omicron variant, Dutch health officials reported Tuesday.

The timing significant suggests variant already present country least week arrival two flights South Africa Friday, World Health Organization labeled Omicron “variant concern,” step prompted countries around world ban flights southern Africa, researchers first identified variant.

“We found Omicron coronavirus variant two test samples taken Nov. 19 Nov. 23,” Dutch health ministry said statement Tuesday. “It yet clear whether people also visited southern Africa.”

The two samples taken municipal health services public testing sites, health authorities started contact tracing areas, Dutch health officials said. able schedule boosters Thanksgiving, waited.

Is *any* scientific reasoning stick pfizer instead moderna booster people whose first 2 shots pfizer?

I've read several people mixing them, curious downsides are, any. Getting moderna would little easier us, location wise.  need rapid tests accurately quickly test infectiousness, instead trace virus. positive infectious, quarantining bad health policy. problem. PCR lab test get medical facility CVS, Walgreens, etc. home kit enough give result. remember, positive test won’t show 3-4 days infection. shitty Christmas gift, Covid talking rationing medical treatment based think people acted. gross. Seriously, got stuck 8 needles one time sudden everyone's enlightened vaccine bad.. Apparently missed every single person became field research virologist. interesting possibility. Given omicron originate within delta lineage speculated arose immunocomprimised populations maybe beta-derived lineage I'm remembering correctly. case proto-omicron viruses circulating southern Africa while. dont even testing requirements upon landing International Travel, 3 days later quarantine. Israel Times article today 2 Triple Pfizer Vaxxed Cardiologists diagnosed. dont need treatment, Vax may reduce poor outcomes stop spread infection Omicron. He's probably wrong people vaccinated get COVID. thread forgetting far vaccines still preventing severe illness matters. going cope fact virus going away probably get COVID multiple times lives. going away lifetimes. can’t really build key analogy op said essentially multiple antibody binding sites spike protein - mutations prevent antibodies binding effectively sites antibodies still able bind sites. There's one type heyhole. key work anymore, key B still does. really! It’s coming mostly unvaccinated, they’re close 25 percent fully vaccinated vs close 60 USA. They’re getting information like good, bad ugly information. yea Yup. illusion freedom what's important. Freedom itself... much also said he'd know weeks. right he's got vested interest many people getting boosters possible new omicron vaccine making company billions Honestly, think jury still it. guessing game hard data comes in. ever one keys cut quite perfectly? would work lock, really jiggle make work? reason unreliable usually one bumps key cut high low. Well, imagine got thousands keys lock. cut properly, bunch slightly higher lower certain spot barely work.

Now imagine door lock mutates one pins lock slightly shorter longer. good keys longer going work. slightly defective one might turn perfect opening mutated lock. Mexican president one constantly downplay dangers Covid something? lot eligible children getting vaccinated US. Parents stepping don’t understand risk afraid. 

It sucks I’m angry it. dunno, maybe don’t extremely corrupt government basically merged corporations might little bit public trust. US know government takes bribes corporations lessen protections public. show us side first.

But system working them, always blame individual. individual responsibility, selling government given us breeding ground conspiracy theories.  Xi said 600 million doses would donations 400 million doses would provided means joint production Chinese companies relevant African countries. China also build 10 health projects Africa send 1,500 health experts, said. mean, boosters might edge, many highly vaccinated countries still outbreaks. Keep mind Moderna already working Omicron-specific Third, Moderna rapidly advance Omicron-specific booster candidate (mRNA-1273.529).

While automatically invalidate statement, demonstrated financial interest selling specific booster, CEO talking. Wait actual research actual scientists forming opinions. one isnt part certain subs rely causing panic issue physical space convention centers would field hospitals...  August 2021 city hovering around 13-18% hospitalizations vaccinated. rose 30% October. boosters rolled out, almost immediately dropped 5% week. know that's case really pushed family boosting ASAP. Short answer: would irrepressible chaos.

It would put severe strain hospitals fallout deaths would catastrophic verging barbaric. Doctors/nurses would look droves people outside hospital knowing nothing beyond bursting seams overflowing. would lose many healthcare individuals stress, PTSD trauma, burnout, human grief. 

Humans cattle; seeing kind human loss would absolutely gut-wrenching. Imagine seeing far fewer people year years blood clot get fixed, cancer elective, name it.

I sure plenty people care, nearly everyone friends/family would begging get hospital treatment anything life-threatening. Fuck. Okay.. I’ll look it, thank 💜 Well, found (lazy lazy). False positive rate False negative rate Two false negatives row = 0.86% probability actually positive. ignoring two negative lateral flows false negative rate leads tp probability 0.035% actually positive. Willing re-evaluate poorly drawn conclusion? BERLIN—The Omicron variant coronavirus could lead infections among vaccinated people likely remain protected severe course illness, according inventor one first Covid-19 vaccines.

While new variant might evade antibodies generated reaction vaccine, virus likely remain vulnerable immune cells destroy enters body, BioNTech SE co-founder Ugur Sahin said.

“Our message is: Don’t freak out, plan remains same: Speed administration third booster shot,” Dr. Sahin said interview Tuesday.


Based current knowledge mechanisms behind vaccine biology variants, Dr. Sahin said assumed immunized people would high level protection severe disease even infected Omicron variant.

Dr. Sahin said vaccine, team invented January 2020 developed together Pfizer Inc., proven protect severe disease variants coronavirus infect vaccinated people.

The currently prevalent variant, Delta, proven adept infecting vaccinated people earlier variants people mostly experience mild symptoms, Dr. Sahin said.

The vaccine developed BioNTech Pfizer, like vaccines, offers two distinct layers protection virus.

The first comprises antibodies, prevent people becoming infected first place preventing viruses colonizing healthy cells body.

Antibodies, however, start wane around five months second dose vaccination, according studies. Due high number mutations, Omicron likely better circumventing antibodies generated contact vaccine Delta, Dr. Sahin said.

The second layer protection comprises T-cells, immune cells body mobilize destroy infected cells infection occurred.


A vaccinated person gets infected typically experience mild symptoms. Dr. Sahin said variant far eluded T-cell immune response, Omicron also unlikely achieve known immune escape regard.

“Our belief [that vaccines work Omicron] rooted science: virus achieves immune escape, achieves antibodies, second level immune response protects severe disease—the T-cells,” said.

“Even escape variant, virus hardly able completely evade T-cells.”

Dr. Sahin’s comments come Moderna Inc. Chief Executive Stéphane Bancel told Financial Times expected current Covid-19 vaccines would less effective tackling Omicron variant.

The BioNTech-Pfizer vaccine originally administered two shots, recent months many countries, including U.S., started offering third, so-called booster shot studies showed people received three doses significantly stronger immunity.

Dr. Sahin welcomed week’s decision U.K. authorities offer third dose adults three months received second shot.

“The U.K. firmly believes third shot offers even better protection, that’s brings forward,” Dr. Sahin said.


“What mean protection case? mean protection severe disease believe vaccinated people high level protection severe disease, increases significantly receive third dose,” said.

Dr. Sahin said company conducting laboratory tests see whether Omicron variant could infect people vaccinated. tests, started last week take two weeks produce results, won’t show whether Omicron causes severe disease; evidenced real-life clinical practice, said.

Dr. Sahin estimated bringing adjusted vaccine market specifically targets Omicron would take 100 days, said might necessary.

“We plan administer third shot people, must stick plan speed up. Whether need extra protection adapted vaccine, remains seen, later,” Dr. Sahin said.

It early say whether populations would need vaccinated regularly foreseeable future maintain high degree immunity, said.

Dr. Sahin said countries currently experiencing surge infection figures, Germany, might need impose restrictions addition speeding booster program.

“Certain measures push infection figures relatively quickly…In current situation favor effective measures,” said. coming Stephane Marcel, even CEO standards, profit-driven egomaniac.

This article sheds light worst shit heard. downvoted comment correct complete asshat. side effects worse 2nd shot? symptoms 1st, 2nd unfortunately put school days, third? Oh sorry, I’m really asking reddit users, impatiently waiting info scientists/doctors fact way says social contagion rather actual side effects, whatever, I’m glad you’re planning get booster point everyone focusing elders ignoring children? 

Because elders benefit vaccinated. far. 

You vaccinate literally everyone aged 0-40 almost statistically significant impact hospitalizations deaths. think last two numbers reversed.  gather vaccinated people probably get sick Omicron avoids antibodies however due cell response virus quickly wiped cells become infected attacked cells meaning less impactful sickness vaccinated individuals. again. Vaccines working. think unfortunately lockdown lockdown, hospitals overflowing COVID patients again, people start seeing hearing mobile morgue units deployed community, jobs lost either way businesses go either way. resources stating otherwise CDC based? somebody recently recovered COVID, interest sparked natural immunity vs vaccinated immunity. case study appears legitimate easy enough search documents regarding it. 

Not trying defend argument natural immunity better vs vaccinated. genuinely want well informed topic. Calm down. one said you.  change. Vaccines mandated one wears masks inside.

And many businesses NYC asking proof vaccination despite mandate, everybody unmasked likely unvaxxed folks too. Yesterday morning cafes restaurants, saw hardly anyone wearing masks, service workers included. I'm sure this. data yet. I’m sorry difficult situation, maybe she’s looks statistics complications COVID vs vaccine would convince her. Honestly, think showing examples people around age suffered COVID could convince her, Cleavon MD twitter tons examples young people passed away COVID, best luck Man, think Military requiring vaccines infringements service member's rights, wait learn Military!

When sign papers MEPS, body government property, yours. get out. got vaccine though, could thing Delta. deaths unvaxxed, good.  Clearly communicated way offices. Neither plans get vaccine neither seems concerned. omicron bad everyone overreacted, got Lol, seriously? Even SA country barely vaxxed death rates far catastrophic.
Most cases mild.

Everyone Europe vaxxed positive Omicron asymptomatic barely sick.

Your doomspeak based nothing. useless, one tool tool box. slow transmission, even slightly, gives time understand we're dealing with.  right. Fuck kids parents. think Pfizer CEO say something foolish needs people trust vaccines produced them? That's awesome! I'm even sure neighbors know get boosters. ones I've mentioned like ""I already that, I'm again."" hope they'll change mind lot stubborn types around grumble things still it. That's first vaccines. Exactly. anything like live, meaningless, opposite effect even police can't (or won't, know tbh) enforce it. people explicitly protesting exact opposite. zero immediate consequences stop. nearly 2 years virus, countless deaths lockdowns, 9+ months vaccines available, say ""who cares"". headline news anymore idiots idiots. That’s trash, go traveling make money try go government/federal employee. $25, Medicaid might cover it. would call Covid hotline city. you’re unable physically get test, might able get someone help bring tests, food, etc. Nurses don’t grow trees. many dumbfucks gonna read get hard cause think means vaccines work 

 Sounds like vaccines prevent serious illness still Omicron that's really matters. people struggle cope never going away going tolerate getting COVID lives.  troll farms.  'other risk shot'. 

The risk shot small, 0. decent estimates risk myocarditis; highest estimates put 1 10,000 young men (most mild lasting side effects). risk Myocarditis get COVID slightly higher 1 1,000 (about 10 times more, although quite comparable, since getting shot, necessarily COVID). Los Angeles tell fact many business enforcing it.

I totally see happening. I'm NYC, tons places never checked vaxx proof despite mandate. everybody goes eat drink risk. kill kids private! Literally one give concrete answer questions variant.

Think this: vaccine demand probably met late winter early spring. it’s hesitant supply chain complications holding up. come Thank you! Here’s another analogy: could reduce risk *aviation* accidents near zero combining layers risk mitigation. 

Oh wait. That’s analogy all. [That’s *actually* direct result, commercial airlines nearly never crash.  google translate page, take grain everything rosy: problems begin risk recovering tested. data show risk recovering infection twice high delta, rate infection 1.3 times rate infection delta. high infection rate: south africa, number patients said increased 15 times 15 days. although low numbers there, pace problematic alarming: israel many israelis vaccinated, arrival variant lead high difficult wave morbidity worrying statistic discovered regarding unvaccinated: risk becoming seriously ill 2.4 times original strain coronavirus, one arrived israel nearly two years ago. ""unvaccinated"", also refers vaccinated two doses entitled boosters yet vaccinated therefore protection insufficient. despite news, data sedative siren comes protecting vaccinated people serious illness infection. Yeah, understand that. question long taking booster shot would take full effect? Exactly point. effectiveness preventing serious illness much greater 2x based data delta. can’t Title 10 Title 23 status time. I’d dig US Code see potential federal/state contention arises. hunch federal level would go next unit list. Id love eligible 11 days Canada busy refusing boosters general population, even neutropenia. neighbour immunosuppressive meds could get it, WBC low WITHOUT meds dont qualify. Makes fuckin sense. Either one, almost never (outside walgreens maybe states trying politically limit vaccine availability) people get turned away. concern initial rollout much better managed recent booster campaign. 

I know that, UK course vaccinate third shot elderly vulnerable groups 1-9 (approx 30 million people) end year, close to, given third dose 18 million far. actually threw bunch numbers explanation math, even dataset used.. 

2.4x serious unvaccinated? 93% efficacy serious symptoms boosted? many people SA boosted?? 

Vaccinations 95% effective infection Delta?? 

Omicron spreading 1.3x quickly???

I can't imagine came numbers. seen data specific 2 antivirals affected Omicron mutations, idea antivirals affected antivirals true. Antivirals generally work binding viral proteins interfere normal function. definitely possible viruses pick mutations allow avoid binding antiviral retaining normal function. See CMV resistance ganciclovir example. doctors tested positive Omicron COVID-19 variant, Sheba Medical Center announced Tuesday, doubling number known cases new virus strain doctors work hospital outside Tel Aviv one recently returned conference London. doctor came close contact colleague, likely infecting them, Sheba said, noting received three doses Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine experiencing mild symptoms.

More evidence community spread outside Africa. Can't put toothpaste back tube...  someone immunologically naïve, safer get vaccinated purposefully get infected Covid. 

Minor degrees effectiveness *not relevant* one options potential death disability. 

You’re going convince diehard antivaxxers. It’s disease. would literally rather die, hard, prevent illness.  Says guy selling vaccines profit…  Yeah makes sense. can’t imagine would way base four cases Israel.

I'm giddy anticipation awaiting return old friend polio!   completely touch reality. Government should

Simple question, government get money from? Oh yeah taxpayers.. Let tell secret: Professionals sectors job effectively completed remotely, already working home. get punished fantasy Lockdown world? Working class people. willing little socially responsible

Can elaborate means? don’t think vaccinated people described socially responsible. constantly talking “Lockdown” “not exposed people”, aren’t possible 2 years pandemic. talked mental health, human beings social animals need face-to-face interactions. put short term inconveniences 2020 first half 2021, people cannot continue longer. That’s reality need Cancer patients die need dine inside restaurant

Never said this. Don’t put words mouth. Also think small businesses simply go bankrupt shut fit fantasy lockdown world, terrible human being. Don’t argue governments need subsidize small businesses indefinitely: again, government get money from?

For me, also responsible citizens, continue wear mask wherever can. sort Lockdown, majority people abide it, happen. anyone recognize source? Yes. That's been. That's pretty much still is. That's way be. fair... since vaccines proved effective, become #1 thing say need everyone do. 

Masks/distancing help keep slowed th emeantime. going far call ""broken""? still strains COVID spreading even efficacy dramatically worse would something like 10% masks equal know help reduce spread. Nothing omicron good, comment way far direction enough information yet conclude vaccines longer work public health value.  initially Moderna switched Pfizer booster. severe side effects 2nd Moderna dose (102-103 fever, chills, uncontrollable shaking, body aches, nausea, vomiting, general malaise). still got sick Pfizer booster; however, fever never went 100.5. take Tylenol every 4-6 hours. I'd say overall feel sick 2nd Moderna, definitely still got sick. CDC others still advise get booster soon eligible. Delta still predominant variant places booster may still provide protection serious illness. know Omicron booster available general public even required. Pfizer helped wife get pregnant. We'd trying six months luck. reproductive health tests us good, wife tracked ovulation cycle closely. Believe me, unprotected sex like anything nothing happened.

Then wife got first shot period second right around time expecting ovulate, boom pregnant. Pretty much sex COVID family since then. So, thanks Pfizer? sick twice chance get infected delta variant.

Previously sick delta? previously sick earlier 1.3 faster Delta

1.3x higher delta, ""currently 1.3, higher 2.4 times chance becoming seriously sick original strain

Is higher lower Delta? No. got good protection 2 weeks second shot. 3rd taken 5+ months second.  submission automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

If continued (and repeated elsewhere) booster take up, especially amongst elderly less mobile, continue drag. check previous vaccination card administering booster update that? give new card altogether Yes I've seeing point well. lot factors make data coming SA different countries. TYSM!!! 😊 Also - good news? (Not sarcastic)

Well, going give super powers, real 'good news' less worse news.  Biden says virus exists

Also says deadly


End comparison guess depends definition good news. better worst case, worse current situation ""good news""? Maybe. think crazy say confirmation things get worse, better, bad news. sounds like meritocratic ideals *journal authors &amp; reviewers necessarily leaders field* belied examples described. I'd venture agree, then, journals gatekeepers academic success purveyors exploitative relationship academics works produce. think must based South African hospital stats.

Literally trying get excited made day case every pathogen existed human history. new pathogen discovered, probably area weeks, months. 

Just look NYC example early days Pandemic. Technically, first case discovered March 1st 2020, research backtracking data showed Covid-19 actually city December 2019. already knew describing problems. context things learning need wait 3 4 months tailored vaccine become readily available fight ones significant help excellent news. say vaccines obviously mean Biontech/Pfizer. leave rest us take AstraZeneca? South Africa cancelled AstraZeneca efficacy low previous SA variant. Even though Omicron different, shares number mutations previous variant. luck. Vaccine hesitancy taken hold much developing world. unvaccinated people isn’t true all. Preliminary reports far severe unvaccinated people, severe vaccinated people Delta, far contagious. 

How “quick road endemicity”? Delta, worse. **far** worse unvaccinated. top this, really gullible base whether wear mask politicians wearing them? 29 year old man, I’ve reached age make decisions without needing old, touch boomer “show it’s done”. tell facts data I’ll decide there. make law something requiring masks, I’ll honor it. read interview.. think CEO product market say anything worse ""this going good"". Especially public health sector. extraordinary negative language, given source, topic, implications. I'm wanting negative realistic specific want people speak (or type)?

That said lot things life relativity inferred listener. 

Either way, spending time talking semantics seems worthless. Nice Still using reddit great good. Never experienced symptoms sort again, like vaccination. second dose easier body, issues whatsoever. Ill cautious heart problem cardiovascular system far. *Planes, Trains, Omicron* coming theaters near March 2023  really confusing talking point pervasive commentary discourse COVID, including public health experts, wearing masks social distancing help pandemic end sooner. makes absolutely zero sense unless think masks social distancing literally extinguish virus. immunity ends pandemic folks. Argue masks want ""you're prolonging pandemic wearing mask!"" sound logic it.  inexplicably insane. 1 every 100 dutch people tested positive *last week* mean stop? really stop either. *reduces* infection *reduces* severe illness. reduces latter former, reduces both.

So what? best science students course went finance business, science. mediocre ones went PhDs research.  Normal. pretty mild. imagine they're military base, vaccinated pretty early. Means antibodies waning. Hope recover quickly.  It’s 6 months since massive delta outbreak. Maybe wiped vulnerable ? really… Probably, exactly opposite vaccination work. get third dose everything worry. quick question. originally would ""fully protected"" 2 weeks applying second dose vaccine iirc. What's timeline booster shots? Also 2 weeks post-shot? let scientists work, write report, release said report?

Simple - either stop reporting baseless speculation conjecture clearly mark such.

Right now, I'm looking front page one local national papers, claims, quote:

""Moderna CEO comments omicron vaccines: going good!"" 

Which nothing feed doomerism, panic sense impending doom. Instead, could gone something along lines of:

""Moderna CEO speculates omicron vaccines"" put opinion pieces, instead latest think people providing false information, perhaps they're start want hold someone responsible.

If CEO vaccine company goes record share opinion, clearly marked such. knows right now, show data. he's spouting conjectures based information have, reporting worldwide pretty irresponsible say least. 

Of course, Moderna's CEO entitled personal opinions. now, media grabbing every single word anybody says Omicron run rush first report – result, people going overloaded Omicron information long actually know anything.

The Anti-vax crowd center world (they fact minority), find reason push back without understanding dynamics virus, pandemic. They've chosen path continue spreading misinformation irrespective correct/incorrect either CEOs health communities initial assessment Omicron. happens efficacy fact lower, going control anti-vax crowds then? stuck scenario. r/OmicronNews ""I join military take orders one!"" Hey let’s take second reflect bad Trump Covid coming America still old variants new ones. point fingers Biden now? don’t care Trump. pointing unfair media be. one needs blame. blame common cold flu?

I hope research continues front throughout world. Cannot wait un-vaxxed use information demented logic. get booster, delay long could get Omicron vaccine?

I mean harsh you. thinking is: present vaccine+booster ineffective Omicron, reason delay people getting Omicron-targeted booster when/if comes along.  reason 3-6 month booster delay needed earlier. Okay smart guy, think realize state problems? think complain constantly terrible state government? think crapping bunch statistics probably spent five minutes looking makes look smart? typical Redditor. saw call state ""**shithole**"" edited out. People like unempathetic love whitewash us bunch hicks. go on. worth arguing.  r/OmicronNews commenting win best username. mRNA decays pretty quickly, much cells shot, absorbed body's cells.

The symptoms mRNA vaccine likely milder getting virus another kind shot.

The consequences COVID-19 way, way worse getting shot.

These vaccines effective conventional vaccines, technology making since MERS outbreak, needed last piece puzzle, stabilizing mRNA enough trigger balanced inmune response. I'd rather booster public health officials recommend play psychological games holdouts. really doubt sequence cases. US 3% instance. belive uk high amount 100% think south Africa good job too. r/OmicronNews link: buy right want, Pfizer stop you. can't make tablet though. Pfizer want do. 

you understand pharmaceutical industry think every company makes API rights to. would they? small-scale clinical manufacturing, yes. large scale global production? nope. they're pharmaceutical company, chemical manufacturing plant. make majority components vaccine either, lipids. sourced external manufacturers well (and also bottle neck vaccine manufacturing). Guhhhh frikkin guy. Downvote me, fuck... fucking guy!!! He's like horrible media outlets wrapped one poor communicator.  Japan havent updated maps since 1990 Definitely, I'd probably put weight Israeli study referenced rather context Clark county article linked article seem cherry pick bit. instance, Israeli study referenced suggesting better coverage infection vaccination also states people caught also got vaccinated even better protection, left county article favor reporting findings different study says additional benefit. Pushing results others complete narrative bit disingenuous regardless study right wrong. Also, quote study size 600k vaccinated people 60k unvaccinated Israeli study, reading study seems eligible candidates - actual number used study 16k authors chose include based comorbidity. might reasonable decision authors may - idea. Regardless, saying study 600k actually using 16k bit misleading well. gets full review obviously sure impacts trust worthiness article, definitely question marks there. r/OmicronNews know anything yet variant. nothing elaborate further. Yes. mechanisms action depend specific variant. Pfizer blocks virus replication, Merck induces mutations make virus nonviable (that lay understanding work, virologist). Yes. People thought good go gor awhile existing vaccines, booster, popped up. Waiting hear better Omicron. people need find natural way selected procreate. little data sure still tons news stories churned referencing bit.  stores exempt pharmacy etc.

Yes, malls, someone LA, malls always packed, they're like LA's version piazzas, everyone goes. like COVID going stay indoor malls choose infect someone eating pasta inside restaurant inside. get COVID indoor space, mall, grocery store, bar, etc. Makes sense include malls mandate, guess might harder check vaxx status mall small restaurant. glad hear mild cases well! Hope it’s soon! know Omicron? That's true! But, also think people vaccinated T-Cells knowing virus, back then, virus new. 
 
Omnicron would supposedly less severe vaccinated folks comparision back one vaccinated, lot less severe Delta.  
 
But that's hypothetical seen. know nothing it. like think scenarios. could go ten different ways handling mandates etc shitshow Day 1 opinions fix it, would complete waste time.

For sanity, keep simple, regardless community covid rates: I‘ll wear mask people planet either vaccinated herd immunity declared- probably means I’ll wearing mask go grocery store et al. next two years (and I’m vaccinated boostered, middle aged, comobidities). Infectious diseases addressed globally, locally- global new local.

If automatically always wear mask without thought, that’s less thinking subject all, that’s best way pretend covid all. People need fucking wear it, forget it. Take two steps back person nearest them, forget it. conversations people day long like big deal. love it? No, it’s like “I’m getting bone marrow biopsy” kinda hate.

Too many messages confuse public muddy issue. It’s like terror threats levels year 9/11. point, it’s irrelevant background noise, people go day there’s threat all. error. assumes virus cannot mutate virulent form. can. starts less severe mean end way. Ha, breathe.  False. live Germany, applied early could vaccine (I even document work placed higher priority group), got second dose mid-August. Agh, hope too. said case delta. sure omicron. Yep always done. saw similar panicky actions countries Mexico 2009 Swine Flu pandemic turned nothing (thankfully). next 1-3 weeks Man selling vaccines says vaccines may needed.

I'll take ""cause concern"", backed independent scientific data I'll also keep bias / conflict interest mind. well baaaaaasically.... much info lol  Fuck it. I'm out.

Dickwits like reason people end echochambers. Fine, fuck decades experience educational background. Fuck anecdotal experience man minority group suffered worst AIDS epidemic. Fuck alllll that. You, stranger internet, clearly right chop part men's dicks slightly lower transmission rate disease ENTIRELY preventable education, protection, medication.

Fuck opinion permanently mutilating men's bodies better solution common fucking sense measures better guess. Didn’t Beta immune-defeating mutations too? Beta never got much foothold US, due Delta, we’re like 99% Delta. think 5x number upper bound, would imply R0 around 10-30, would make transmissible virus existence, surpassing measles. need data tho, 5x number estimated cases.

Personally (and I'm expert, mind you), seems least transmissible less Δ variant. Shocking,

Provider record profit making vaccine says may need vaccines Hand glove better analogy Vulnerable people need safe access pharmacies. Get kids tested take public Covid. even Covid, need 100% compliant masking symptoms.  way interpret “so far behind” is, “so far behind want to/should be” Yes, now, one commercial product. Generally, knock wood, deadlier virus associated far lower transmissibility. Something like COVID-19 really perfect storm lethal enough serious problem mild enough spread easily lull people false sense security. good writing Honestly safest felt months.

Because passive aggressive statement like civilized adult you... *eye roll* think RCTs submitting data authorization ... also data now, since tons people gotten boosters ; OTOH, much data 1st dose, little less 2nd dose, much less (now) booster.   readily available since April Germany well.

Sorry, didn’t realise spoke whole uk’s scientific advice community. Please elaborate. I've read comments scientists suggest Omicron might get advantages evading existing immunity rather easier transmission.

Omicron shares number mutations Beta, capable evading vaccine immunity Delta. Beta contagious (more original variant, lot less Delta), failed gain advantage.

While South Africa fairly low vaccination rate, hit hard Delta, probably fair amount immunity prior infection. background, variant able evade immunity gain dominance variants might higher transmission, easily dealt existing immunity (Delta-after-Delta reinfections probably extremely rare).

Anecdotally, people know remained concerned COVID blue/highly-vaxxed city (understandably) parents young kids.

When look success New York City's requirements vaccine card enter nearly public establishment, think that's pretty much way forward. really problem outcompete Delta less severe. Would actually good. moron,you're 50% likely get infected uncircumcised, plus risk SMEGMA(gross) booster probably help maintain 97%, rather adding additional protection beyond that.

And booster not, we're still waiting see efficacious current vaccines new variant - they'll probably 0% 97% effective, with, solid likelihood they'll least somewhat less protective.  US can't even agree nurses doctors vaccinated. Jupp. every place like Switzerland, 70% population uses public transport commute, places Europe like 50% more. quite bit higher cities metropolitan areas. MODS already around 65-75% delta variant kicking around, expect drop that? incorrect this?


If drops current vaccine efficacy like 45%, drops severe infection efficacy, would devastating blow months make vaccine variant. get shot leave service, win-win. Canada pretty nice place... even ""socialism"" stuff. believed vaccines still offer levels protection severe disease hospitalization, even strong infection. would never need force everyone got done. risk told enough people fail needs done own.

This.  different eyes petulant child. ask nicely. ask nicely. ask. tell. demand. Still done ? Force.

I like government telling either, matters public health, different ball game apolitical (non-political). That's fine 90% US Women prefer circumcised males disagree. much experience treating COVID now, able create accelerated training programs people become 'COVID EMTs' whatever want call them. 

Basically, pay people take 10-week crash course triage, setting oxygen masks IVs, monitoring vital signs, COVID-specific things. people take care bottom 80 percent less severe cases, leave doctors nurses help rest. might keep antivax nuts disturbing attacking crew onboard well already Covid, getting vaccine really Omicron virtually every country first discovered. IDK supposed do. soon Omicron came radar, news media went full ""panic!!"" mode Exactly--That's getting circumcised must Even though 2 companies may agree other, still reason present views way do.

BioNTech/Pfizer currently producing doses getting approval booster shots earlier Moderna places. Moderna behind race boosters. hand, Moderna immediately announced working new version vaccine.

Consequently, BioNTech/Pfizer financial interest stating ""No worries, get booster still good protection!"" whereas Moderna benefits stating ""Current version might work well, better wait bit booster get updated vaccine!""

Two statements based reality (vaccine efficacy reduced, still sufficient (severe) illness booster)), express different recommendations based financial interests entity making statement. forbidden make compound. Pfizer buying third party manufacturers. Pfizer manufacture API... people mentally prepared mask maybe go back limited capacity stuff. saying anything lockdowns. Restrictions make sense it’s much transmissible delta escape immunity. Best case scenario none happens better prepared I’d say going make comment... fuck think people going know whether article new information without reading though?

Which doubly insane considering many vaccines get join armed forces.  actually contradictory? efficacy vaccine severity disease two different things. hadnt sequenced them. didnt disclose many sequenced. Could 14 15, could 14 50. basically got boosted moderna july? Im pretty sure getting another dose advised right thats case you. They’re telling J&amp;J recipients get one dose mrna, self. Speculation isnt information US hasn’t identified case yet makes question much genetic testing we’re even doing. fat, elderly, unhealthy

In US, that's least 2/3 population. Hard dismiss, ethically politically. roses happiness (or whatever best antonym is)

sunshine rainbows think Oh come on, aren’t panic wild assumptions fun? Joking aside, answer questions “we don’t know yet” regarding omicron. source seems like goal HIV prevention. LOL  media presenting latest info.

lol vaccine broken today ? bother source handy hear majority hospitalizations South Africa unvaccinated. Conflicting \*Speculative information   see conflict here. Moderna CEO said existing vaccines would ""struggle"" Omicron variant - suggests efficacy take hit. imply risk severe illness goes way up. could vaccines' effectiveness drops 75%, would represent 10-20% drop, still *fantastic* vaccine traditional terms.

Honestly, part problem we've kind spoiled near-miraculous effectiveness new mRNA vaccines. throwing everyone's expectations off. don’t love analogy though. rigorous car seat standards, speed limits, airbags, products liability. protection children Covid. Anthrax vaccine comes mind… Experts also urge people wear masks exhalation valves. kinds masks good protecting wearer, protect around don’t filter anything coming valve.

Recommend reviewing following study date information subject, research shown statement findings show FFRs exhalation valve provide respiratory protection wearer also reduce particle emissions levels similar better provided surgical masks, procedure masks, cloth face coverings.

Unfortunately recommend people still cover valved respirator due prevalence misinformation contained article, even though CDC [now individuals wearing NIOSH-approved N95s exhalation valve asked use one without exhalation valve cover face covering mask  exactly conflicting information? moderna ceo said vaccine would likely less effective, ineffective. level protection line less severe outcomes vaccinated. missing something? mean, still immunity, starting wane. boosters exist keep immunity target percentage. Someone vaccinated, gotten booster, still hell better position get COVID someone vaccinated all.

That said, get saying. Boosters required mandates point time. Ironically, people screeching mandates force people get vaccinated forever literally ones causing us need continued boosters. people would stop dumb fucks get vaccine, need require boosters. learned Trump.  awards give would yours.  Moderna gang   Imagine willing die country, somehow still afraid vaccine. believe this? tons studies support this. paying attention?  ""Garry see mutations might help Omicron evade body's immune response -- especially previous infections."". question is, actually need compete Delta? point see mutations strong immune response one variant transfer strong immune response another variant, people infected multiple variants time. exactly. know dozen people 30 got covid basically sniffles.

This made skeptical everything going get vaccine circles Given HIV rate SA, wonder many kids born infected? ok. talking fact ""not actively looking this"" still talking this. yes completely normal nothing wrong. think, politicians assume people talk world well informed about, way used (think tv big stages). still dont understand ""meta"" reddit twitter.

However clubs bars likely close, big activities limit capacity educated guess best. It’s also basic science though. Nope. vaccine proof asked upon entry bets unless restaurant specifically requests otherwise. I'd say 50/50 split terms servers wear masks.  Moderna said protection going high - contradict statement. Eg - catching spreading Omicron may higher vaccinated compared Delta, symptomatic illness worse may comparable. new French vaccine Valneva uses whole virus traditional. saw hope immunosuppressed people one. Young kids far likely die car accident covid - yet people let kids ride cars. think assume direct equivalency efficacy dosage though. Spahn doesn’t mean others are. Many CDU led states agree it, even new potential party chief Friedrich Merz  Moderna claiming reduced vaccine efficacy, know much. Pfizer claims T-cells induced vaccine still help protect severe disease. things mutually exclusive possibilities.  Awesome. Moderna big shot indicating really bad Pfizer big shot saying big deal. sort reporting fucking jet fuel antivaxx assholes. media two heads two companies making pre-emptive claims.

Nope, Delta transmissible, deadly.

The theory, viruses evolve become less deadly transmissible time, overly simplistic. way become transmissible make people sicker, hence deadly, that's way evolve.

But worries new variant, Omicron, flaring across world, Britain edged back line neighbors rushing protect itself. Prime Minister Boris Johnson swiftly banned travel 10 African countries, made face masks compulsory shops public transportation, Tuesday greatly accelerated deployment vaccine booster shots, hoping inject every adult end January.

Britain’s approach still significantly looser countries like Austria, back national lockdowns. People gather pubs without masks, example, officials keep promising weary Britons normal Christmas. Mr. Johnson said government prepared stiffen laissez-faire approach, least moment, stave another wave infection. Findings section, see following:

*The SAR \[secondary attack rate\] household contacts exposed delta variant 25% (95% CI 18–33) fully vaccinated individuals compared 38% (24–53) unvaccinated individuals.*

*SAR among household contacts exposed fully vaccinated index cases similar household contacts exposed unvaccinated index cases (25% \[95% CI 15–35\] vaccinated vs 23% \[15–31\] unvaccinated).*

That looks like vaccinated contract virus less frequently (and clear quickly), transmit rate, bolsters point COVID positive airplane regardless vaccine status.

Did miss something wanted show me? I'm open changing mind. Wait, seriously? say that?
So cases report referring to? include cases South Africa? would assume to, enough confirmed cases Europe say anything.

No large portion population vaccinated now, half severe still way less severe beginning pandemic. add vaccinations equation. That's frustrating - I'm vaccinations whatsoever, one also take account psychological aspects it, gonna probably dampen booster shot uptake

People promised ""get shot(s) it'll over"" - get yet another (and shots future)? Getting vaccine shot / booster zero cost peoples' minds. One go way get shot, deal needle (which big deal some), deal potential side effects (sometimes 1-2 days illness, more).

Tomorrow latest confirmed. ridiculous depends factors cannot possibly know. South Africa seeing Omicron cases rising 5-fold per week compared Delta cases; holds elsewhere would weeks city flights Johannesburg. 5-fold could easily driven immune escape versus previous infection hold areas lower population immunity higher vaccination/infection ratios. latter case there's guarantee Omicron would positive rate spread all. hope don’t shut country “15 days” stop spread  AZD said they're confident vaccine protect serious illness today. people get virus, higher amount severe cases getting.

However, number exposures increases 2.4 daily basis, make difficult body's vaccinated immune system keep up? Yeah need better studies AZ needs auto reply every omicron question least like 2 weeks Re: 3, 2.4x sounds like similar ballpark previously heard Delta, although maybe numbers changed.

Also curious, nobody 18 eligible boosters currently (at least US, sure countries).

Why? seems Pfizer cannot look somewhere else, enough drug.

That meant monopoly: monopsony active principle. Thus, chemical production companies (I sure outsourced companies India pay cents workers) enough money expand plants produce ingredients. Thus, production API slower.

If drug price lower API price higher, lots money would go workers India could higher people, make drugs faster.

PRELIMINARY DATA good news afternoon! Pfizer vaccine’s SLIGHTLY less effective preventing infection Omicron Delta- 90% opposed 95%- EFFECTIVE preventing serious symptoms- around 93% – least boosted!

Full thread found referencing info found according report new variant infection rate 1.3 higher Delta. high originally feared. levels shock immeasurable. 12 exempt hey, tell them, me. Anti-vax rhetoric seeping conservative thought absorb loudest anti-covid voices also hate vaccines.  feel two different things, vaccinated feel safer Holy fuckballs that's solid science right there.

Besides ivermectin plan wok partially blind knew working. /s would love see type person sees Covid, Delta, Omicron say ""im still getting vaccine"". person's life like? delusional? Ah yes, remember measles way back 2019. It’s also possible factors involved sooner later period, getting pregnant. Let’s wait data stop hot takes people can’t possibly know yet. Yes. think there's likelihood that. SA something like 10000-100000 times many cases per population country.

If came somewhere else first infected would immediately fly SA together. Pretty unrealistic. Article mention anything sample size population make up, it'll interesting see release information.  way vaccination affect you? comment makes believe think conspiracy I’m unsure *why* goalposts keep shifting?

How cause shifting goal posts make less naive believe *this* time different? rate infection 1.3 times higher Delta.

That's wild Delta much contageous original strain, original strain considered highly contageous. evolving deadly, evolving spread more. Depends prevalent already country, much contagious/infectious well immunity/vaccines work it. 

Only time tell. limiting contacts again. save idiotic antivaxxer, best (hopefully) relieve pressure doctors hospitals. 

Very happy lucky workplace lets us decide whether go office not. colleagues considerate careful people, also kids school, pose risk nevertheless.

That said, absolutely fuck everyone still believing that
A) need let virus circulate without restrictions we’ll immune (at cost several thousand unnecessary dead)
B) need care measures vaccines Good Immune System (because playing fire, long COVID thing clearly care people die ignorance). proof travel bans based racism rather science. peer reviewed journals claiming viral loads amongst vaccinated decrease exponentially faster vaccinated vs unvaccinated viral load good predictor contagious, would make sense claim vaccinated individuals spread virus lower rate vaccinated? curious what's even point knowing started?

We're traveling Thanksgiving Christmas year, plane times, interactions people unknown (but unlikely) vaccination status, plus husband's (vaccinated) sister pregnant. seemed like right thing do. 

Don't get wrong, feel would've fine wait since effectively got natural booster shot back September, certainty worth go get booster - Omicron, feel even solid choice. know political theater since literally need court cite Jacobson v.

I'm hearing fatigue rather stricly anti-vaxx. like, ""ugh....really? more?....ugh fine""  One shot enough anymore. % protection infection wanes quickly. vaccines multiple shots. Spread months/years apart. 

Anyway complicates things, low vax rate. makes better/worse picture.... adds pieces puzzle. 

13% vaccinated hospital good 24% vaccinated. One could argue directly proportional vaccines working all. 

But again, even 2 shots may enough anymore. also ltos questions. comorbidities ill? Anyone previously infected? Also country 20% HIV positive.

So, hello measles, welcome back. 😕 That's great four people taking about. like 'Merck induces mutations [randomly] [hopefully] make virus nonviable [and potent]'?  Great, vaccinate 22 month old now? Would love like.. yesterday. percentages... none variants broke immunity 100%. Otherwise they'd still around spread far. Maybe broke 10... 20... 30%. Seems big right?  may big enough anymore breakthrough population immunity whole transmission may high enough stay alive. sadly need wait data Omicron. I'd disagree that, strongly. 
My assumption following: 
To understanding think variant escapes vaccine induced immunity, occurance evolutionary pressure caused universal vaccination peak pandemic. 
Think example: 
Suppose 1000 petri dishes bacteria colonies food resources. 
You take 500 start raising temperatures 1% colony survives. 1% ones random mutation allows survive increased temperatures. (Man-Made Evolutionary pressure)Now let reproduce make resources available 1% eliminating competition suddenly 500 petri dish colonies 100% population decendents bacteria ability withstain increased temperatures.

 
Now suppose randomnly pick petri dish 1000 petri dishes start running tests. increase temps find bacteria chose, dying.

 
Is likely petri dish randomly chose clearly trait surviving increased temps, came 500 bacteria colonies raised normal room temperature likely picked petri dish pressured survive conditions?

 
Viruses work way. constantly randomly mutate whenever spread, sort spread cloud variants. Usually dominant strain outcompete strains. narrowly targeted, vaccine induced, antibodies detect dominant variant kill off?

 
Now variants random mutation evade vaccine immunity, resources available themselves, spread vaccinated person person infected variants evaded vaccine induced immunity allows variant become dominant, would outcompeted past dominant variant.

 
Those 2 cents research I've studied, thoughts?  fair point though essentially commander chief (the governor) issued conflicting order.  This, also, “partially vaccinated” doesn’t seem count much, especially variants like Delta. sure one shot counted fully vaccinated data…I think us would like see someone complete vaccination series fares given variant. 18 million already given lag identification. People get covid results sent CDC see Omicron instead run mill Delta something else. Meanwhile medical reference labs develop tests Omicron wait vendors(like Abbot Labs) get tests instruments test specific strain. Time money.  


Once see specific Omicron testing happening reference laboratory level get much clear picture happening 'hospital going' populace.

Fingers toes crossed! [Vaccination reduces risk hospitalization That's doctors saying. Masks help protect remaining 15% (it's unclear exactly effect are) federal government mobilize Guard go get vaccinated?

Ha, bad idea. Real-world numbers actual efficacy values: they're dramatic underestimates. huge correlation risk (age) vaccination boosting numbers. Colorado instance around 47% 65+ group booster, compared 17% 18+ group. means boosted group rather dramatically average higher risk level unboosted.

Did vermont release include comparisons age group? would solve problems (and likely give several times better risk ratio numbers).  kidney stone, waited emergency waiting room 7 hours, asked tylonol, got lecture supposed give meds seen. got taken around tests confirm kidney stone put painkiller iv seen dr.

no healthcare dosnt cost anything holy hell shit. federal government mobilize Guard go get vaccinated? want do? Stay ship? I'm pretty sure every passenger required quarantine 2 weeks even tested negative 😭😭 point it’s terrifying able get vaxxed part article confusing irresponsible? don’t see it’s confusing.  would certainly explain Netherlands quite rapid growth cases despite high vaccination high prior-immunity (compared somewhere like Germany, also growing cases).

Seems unlikely though, would picked random sampling significant numbers it.

Still... cases traced within Europe back week two[0] already thousands cases found Europe (yet), probably safely rule ""500% transmissible!"" theories. ""probably less transmissible Delta, higher immune escape"" theory likely.

[0] - see also cases Scotland linked one event ten days ago; cases Israel linked back someone who's last foreign travel UK two weeks ago. automobiles?? reasons get booster arms rapidly! Yes naturally literal worst case scenario exists.  Guess we'll see... 

Keeping people hospital important thing. Less effective ineffective. know what's ineffective, vaccinated Best answer saw recently ""we'll know 2 weeks"". want ice cream  need better way monitoring though Vaccines provide protection. agree. 
 
But 2020 dealt COVID vaccine? 3rd world countries lagging behind due limited medical resources inability vaccinate citizens consistent rate like developed countries? 
 
Again clear vaccines provide level protection. big question recovered COVID19 (And vaccinated) offered level protection maybe better? constituents hicks.  COVID winning already, son cannot get help undiagnosed autism without degree risk entire family. is, national vaccination program that's required go school one vaccine issue. actually gave vaccines poor people rural areas first, killing hundreds thousands. know 100% purpose. military ALWAYS meet vaccination requirements absolutely nothing new

The covid vax long time now. reason scared it. Grow courage get vaccine. Serious question: unfortunately got “natural booster” toward middle September, that’s getting Pfizer shots March April, respectively. go ahead get booster now, wait natural boost immunity wane? latter, long wait? I’d rather prolong immunity long possible can, can’t seem find straight answer anywhere. course would say need sell billion vaccines yikes. I'm sorry. relevant Covid? seems place. want drug companies release vaccines don’t exist diseases haven’t found yet?

Could please share you’re smoking, sounds like it’s effective dissociative high. market cap increased $5 billion $138 knew would fail, bringing lawsuit (with tax payer dollars btw) scores political points.  It’s lot sensitive, leads world orgasms. Seriously, feel bad male friends got circumcised kid. It’s easy wash shower keep clean  makes feel much better booster appointment Thursday. basically main concern. It’s different kind diplomacy, fairness. China selling them. 

If poor African country buys 20 million cheap vaccines China gets 5 million donated US free, probably view equally favorable. Unless Omicron variant comes significantly deadly, likely change nature Ok completely red.

While think absolutely despicable reprehensible, political calculation make sense. Well sure, get vaccinated. agree. 

But 2020 dealt COVID vaccine? 3rd world countries lagging due limited medical resources inability vaccinate citizens consistent rate like developed countries?

Again agree vaccines provide level protection. big question recovered COVID19 offered level protection *or maybe better?* Dude, I'm sorry, give flying fuck anymore.

Add booster ok right? reckon Curevac trial Moderna/Pfizer double vax Moderna/Pfizer booster? managed spread country believed less immunity, 

But really? IMO COVID waves crest combination circumstances brings R0 one. things like mask mandates, social distancing immunity. Since first two relatively constant virus immediately resurge wave, I'd say bulk work done natural immunity COVID infections. Waves, notice, never last long... Perhaps places like South Africa lack vaccination rates make herd immunity. SA ending Delta wave Omicron hit likely immune Portugal was. possibly given much difficult social distancing poorer countries many South Africans young people care R0 would higher begin with. immune escape Alpha-level transmissibility, could mean Omicron room grow terms transmissibility (such picking P681R gene), could compound dangerous is.

Not surprise. I'm sure Omicron last immune escape would mean potentially needing design new antibody treatment maybe needing make variant specific vaccines (although boosters help now) transmissible strain need those, would make boosters existing vaccines important.


Good point. I'm cautiously optimistic front. suspect coronaviruses COVID variants heterogeneous portrayed. IIRC beginning pandemic established even people sick different coronavirus long ago level protection COVID. COVID quickly become different coronas it? doubt it. Soon people walking around 3 boosters probably least one infection enough protection even immune escape variant.   Wait, there’s target? happens, would hope future restrictions minimal. Oh Jesus, America far behind? west wave Delta Summer Fall mitigation’s place. Oregon lifted it’s outdoor mask mandate. deaths per 100,000 people.

Not deaths per 100,000 people infected COVID. proportion people diagnosed Covid-19 admitted hospital past two weeks line waves infection South Africa, driven variants, said Waasila Jassat, public-health specialist NICD.

This doesn’t make Omicron feel threatening link. Thank insight things country right now. think lot ""anyone vaccinated moron"" stuff see Americans assuming everywhere world America. here, vaccines readily available since early year large amount people chosen get without good reason. 

Best luck family. I'm 30 year old male makes difference. know, I’m getting tired “old people front line” crap. People 65 need work, raise families avoid getting sick. wife go ER emergency heart procedure year ago. Thank God lived county people wore masks, social distanced, able got vaccinated. states hospitals overwhelmed point may made it. well whole team available help scheduled surgery next day. get really angry people don’t give shit won’t smallest thing keep people safe. thought, circumcised male 40 years, would different interesting experience foreskin.  plenty patients ICU thought prior infection enough protect them. great long term strat alive constituents... Thanks. That's crazy me. 😐 good thing? multiple labs conduct research methodology find similar results, sounds like win replicability. lower transmission rate 😂  allowed quarantine new vaccine arrives. gotten point even people take covid seriously beginning adopt certain parts anti-vax rhetoric breakthrough cases. even saying Pfizer Moderna sued so-called ""lying public"" Omicron Challenge sounds like sort extreme obstacle course think Omicron destroys economy, lockdown fashion, disrupt supply chain, boosting inflation forcing fed tamp fashion switched using Greek letters naming. Otherwise country discovered becomes stigmatized.

The thing happened 1918. Spanish flu originate Spain, likely US. Spanish reported rest world suppressed news became associated Spain. RCTs done boosters big enough size catch signal? seems like we’re inferring (probably reasonably) there’s compounding risk. can’t really say confidence could bigger trial done “You’ve already stung one hornet, running away nest they’re flying of? It’s pointless avoid getting stung again!” comment negligent unsurprising given amount money stands make. 

I believe affect US public policy. good news Paxlovid (Pfizer antiviral pills) dependent variants like vaccines are.  There's studies suggest getting vaccinated helps ease symptoms long Used be, covid. Covid taken many lives people used parties. used go parties, next? Except data based 3 clinical trials poorly managed never repeated them. Dutch person rather easy follow understand Afrikaans, oddly enough vice versa harder. mainly due Afrikaans rather ""pure"" old-fashioned Dutch, rather wide vocabulary basic understanding words, easy. 

Also ties close, however, Netherlands holiday destination besides Amsterdam, crowed. lot Dutch people however go South Africa, think far African country. influenced e.g. cuisine, tea drink, food eat, braai's, wine drink, etc.

Almost anybody know point lives visited South Africa. get quite exchange students well, even corporate ties. political climate turned somewhat hostile. Cut out! slow transmission, even slightly

I think interesting question ""slightly"". trade worth makes almost deterrent countries step forward. Since know identify new variant, they'll actively punished travel restrictions limitations.

I answer this, think making trade slightly slower transmission might worth long run. talk part science bro. verboten.  pandemic political game truth lie.... trust government reports death counts severity sickness. Things worse told. headlines, omg. real question! percentage unvaccinated Omicron? Idk vaccines using 87% sounds pretty low consider 75%ish population unvaccinated Hey everyone, I'm scheduled get booster Thursday week. wondering risk getting finding ineffective new variant able get effective one variant. adjustment current vaccines take ~6months develop anyway? Thanks!  I’m getting everyone vaccinated let’s real. Vaccinated people still spread virus well won’t make much difference honestly. Yea makes sense me. expect messy best. ""Computer, activate Emergency Medical Hologram!""  panic, predicting rational outcome based events already occurred. People aware possible outcomes, one many scenarios could happen. Downvote want, society care lead similar results. vast majority, care. Yeah. pod holding get kid vaxxed. 5 right now, holding pattern. We've opened bit, keep pretty minimal (mask-wearing stores, coordinating shopping trips, indoor restaurants bars, gatherings vaxxed people, etc).

I ""lucky"" pandemic, work home, able arrange afford in-home child care pod-member, set pod social support... feel like barely made it. entire pod exhausted. would bet vast majority people less support me, honestly, fault people deciding ""done"".

However, fault people getting vaccinated wearing mask near vulnerable/when sick. look bare minimum.  Worth noting Pfizer's dose booster 30 mcg. Moderna's booster practically already double dose 50 mcg compared Pfizer's vaccine. lol bet fun parties quite 180 5 days ago... Correct wrong. theNATIONAL guard, Nation, body acts federal level. makes state think good idea try get say agencies institutions act nationwide? Maybe could send unused shots billions unvaccinated people walking variant factories point mandates get insurance companies board we'll never get 60% vaccination rates given time. Seems would even fairer simply refuse medical treatment willfully unvaxxed.  Especially triaging bottom sounds cruel, losing health care workers. time people's important, scheduled procedures hey pushed out. affects things like cancer surgery friend's littler daughter's great surgery. ironic part is, governor likely vaccinated. He's score political points unvaccinated constituents. Grocery stores exempt pharmacy etc. Sitting outside exempt well. Starbucks want sit inside need provide get busy mobile orders ability, often times interaction way keep provided us registry didn't. sure. wont know another weeks, interesting speculate. Im thinking there's good chance people developing foundation immunity virus whether vaccine induced infection induced may bring milder symptoms general population. I'm sure vaccines get experimental Covid ones. probably going 50/50 shot infected decent 90% chance getting hospitalized. Well said. probably too. According CDC reduces risk HIV infection 50-60% sec HIV positive person. Seems big deal Africa. can't refute said tests time limited instructive comprehensive. Totally agree you. I’m frustrated one willing step plate actually lead. hoped Biden would it. Australian, please listen anything federal government says. say whatever need right appease populace, hesitate complete 180 within matter hours. Shareholders watch stock graph go down. extremely rare instances get actively involved running company (beyond buying selling stock). immune target flu much tougher immune system spike protein SARS CoV 2. Additionally, immune system produces antibodies polyclonally (either naturally vaccine), targeting specific epitope, rather broad array across spike protein, makes full immune escape near impossible. mutation accumulate allow degree immune evasion (i.e. double triple vaccinated individuals infected), likely binding affinity Coronavirus ACE2 receptors.

This virus existed nature long time, likely, infecting mammals binding ACE2 receptors. required quite specific set mutations alter specificity end binding human ACE2 receptor. going optimization evolution SARS CoV 2 make binding human ACE2 increase infectivity evade immune response, vast majority mutations would decrease affinity. It’s certainly possible. wouldn’t around anyway recover  I’m making point 2021, people making decisions aren’t looking whole picture. What? two? Here's article math changed

Before people lockdown family.

Now vaccinated people self preservation gone many...

So locking protect unvaxxed gonna popular. sure point is, OP specified residents that’s responding to. tired public nap want act like toddlers. Well ….. sucks. know yet. Nobody knows.

Let's hope so, though. boosting every morning. put water supply. Boost get public transport. Going airplane today? Boosted! Twice!

as far know? exactly far know?  China may fucked initial response, fuck around. look happened last month. One positive case person Disneyland, locked 34000 people park, brought hundreds medical staff hazmat suits, tested person could leave park, used 200 busses bus people directly home, made home quarantine another 2 days get 2nd negative test ending quarantine. tracked tested 100k people also prior 2 days. epsilon, zeta, eta, theta, iota, kappa, lambda?
We went straight delta omicron.  INSANE. know why? Heterosexual sex super likely cause transmission HIV. lot IV drug use something?   typical Canadian political posturing make us look good global scale. targets meet. 0.5% vaccinated... Good call. stand corrected.

*Pulls poetic license departs podium* Lack info also governments making big proclamations Yep. state, isn’t sick pay vaccines anymore. result, nobody job gotten one. We’re young bad reactions second dose know would need days work. Plus it’s inconvenient.  Yeah, I'm saying answer aspect it. citrus-hued one stirred pot something nasty. Bro, same! learned yesterday, told disbelief, like, ""Oh ya, know that?""

Still hard wrap head around Keep us posted got covid :p  idea statistically, rough time 2nd Moderna felt nothing sore arm booster. ""Nu easily confounded 'new' Xi used common surname,"" organization explained emailed statement ""And best practices naming new diseases suggest 'avoiding causing offense cultural, social, national, regional, professional ethnic groups.' "" vaccines well Omicron would better  doubt that. Angelique Coetzee also speaking head South African Medical Association. suspect colleagues SAMA would come hard vocally thought saying stuff political reasons. sick they?  Also, stop think it, adapting company work remotely multiple advantages:

The impact work trips lot lesser already place infrastructure communicate people. 

People arrive office grupmy exhausted one-hour two-hour trip every day. 

You hiring base expands lot, may even hire people cities work good locals. 

You smaller office lower costs associated it, including electricity, internet, cleaning staff, supplies... 

Someone getting cold mean entire office get it. 

Like... company see opportunity jump it? year 2041 - travel major cities forbidden unless one received semi-monthly injection accompanying updated digital reference ID dose.

Fuck bro - I'd rather die. always going another variant don’t seem really know future looks like one. 

People need stop trying predict future start living life much available right now. burying news....like Maxwell trial care required wear mask able travel. mask mandates borders return reasonably open, care.

I’m ending restrictions letting willingly unvaccinated deal repercussions get sick. that’s happening next best option let vaccinated people travel live restrict unvaxxed. It’s like fda doesn’t every incentive world approve infants &amp; toddlers. sure it’s safe. imagine would happen global vaccination efforts bunch babies severe vaccine reactions? MUST proceed caution. alarmist Friday Saturday, seems taken polar opposite trying give people false sense security. Neither responsible. Neither even frickin necessary garnering viewers. wholly irresponsible. India started contact tracing US, idea still discussed circulated here. Well again, lot people US propably got vaccinated **because** promise freedom vaccination would give you.

We debate germany, although masks never lifted unvaxed people (simply cannot see someone vaxxed checking every insititution, like supermarkets, bothersome workers).

Lifting restrictions unvaxxed people early promises made towards vaxxed people false, heavily implied known people politics. Apart usual political games (voting year all) also implied known still chosen, without promises less people would vaccinated themselves. Biden right. Everyone eligible boosters since September instead right Thanksgiving. Oh look, Omicron popped everyone's radar right around Thanksgiving. Appointments boosters hard get big cities, super easy smaller cities towns out. Part suspects timeline boost population level immunity *now* (Omicron, Christmas, winter) rather 3 months statistically better timeline.  Sorry hear that. Hope get soon get clear bill health!! Holy shit HIV rate alarming hell. knew bad, know bad. Oh look, man reddit thinking knows trained woman Depends state employer guess. I'm echo big research hospital CA mid 50s RNs make fair amount that. I've seen echo travel 5k week ICU nursing 8k I've worked home since 2015 that's perk me. understand people enjoy around family long periods time, love it. relevant discussion having. Also mentioned US doesn’t one clear app verifies actual medical records (like EU app, CA app). NYC one app pic card faked.
So…it absolutely relevant. 

We need one solution across board verifying vaccination status checks actual vax records. Oh wow, that's really cool great hear. Gives us good hope beating thing even variants keep popping up.  anti vaxxers nutjobs, vaccines running smoothly. think Brazil get last laugh pandemic.  1) probably there’s massive pandemic?  lost every direction.

For starters, public health expert weighed meaningful data % SA would infected strain. 

And flyers SA far different someone remote city. likely around people infectious shit, **like fly fucking plane**. 

And fluctuations small data sets normal. 2% 13% one fluctuations dealing dozens infected people. situation 2 people cause huge % increase rate situation explain away 6.5x claimed infection rate noise data set. Gotta set bar somewhere though . Next it'll text speak emojis. still wait 6 months second shot? simultaneously alarming alarming enough. see. Well, apparently Omicron causes pediatric hospitalizations, though suppose widespread Michigan would've detected already. Yeah, I've cut half dress top half!  Montreal, yeah wear one outside it’s fucking cold warms face I'm US, I'm roughly 3.5 months second shot, eligible booster?  Americans ""fully vaccinated"" It’s really protecting health economy citizens first. get it’s already spreading, yes make way every city shortly, question longer spread infections time better. doesn’t overwhelm hospitals keeps people working longer. Planes SA particular really high rates variant appropriate limit coming spreading different parts country time watch prepare. 

I understand emotional topic you, think you’re missing mark calling racism. seems long :(. Lmao exactly factless response id expect u Well, technically “Omni-“ means “all,” i.e. omnipotent means all-powerful omniscient means all-knowing. Omnipresent means everywhere.

But still fits. Maybe best comment I’ve seen covid post. kind get reverse social pressure parts country now. Like Georgia, quite now, I’d one like 3 people building wearing mask, you’d get looks everyone else. stopped bothering places except like grocery stores one else gives damn there’s point.

Kind got culture shock going back visit family Illinois weekend asked put mask once, forgotten people actually still care rational parts country.  Variants positive severity gets reduced becomes dominant. need mutate common cold. can't really stop ever mutating global did. never mentioned again. clear might temporarily cost popularity, shut up. could stared resistance, could tried LEAD instead follow; weak. Yes Yeah, weird anyone saying otherwise.  No, many vaccines take 3-4 rounds shots protection. isn’t valid argument getting vaccinated. fair... lack vaccines countries caused problem SA. 

Apparently vaccine hesitancy problem. stopped ordering/taking great amounts. 

Meanwhile vaccines/boosters sitting US shelves we've reached vax limit well. think both. reason can't. Ship vaccines world (the US shipped counties combined), boost citizens. Feb 2020 told client ""Next time see we'll masks"" eyes rolled. wrong (well least far) never expected next time. (Nobody died, completely stopped traveling) speculation pointless. take 2 weeks minimum robust analysis. Follow data science. let government screw up. Hopefully not. Oklahoma also one states gigantic wealth disparity. Oil Gas industry makes massive amounts money top giving next nothing bottom. ""partially vaccinated""? That'd understandable ""unvaccinated."" That's stupid group people like that

I'd prefer time-weighted statements. 
 
Maybe, ""at X months,"" since last shot. 
 
Discussion efficacy muddled --  
 
* -- discussed binary 'YES / NO' terms 
* -- discussed fixed across time 
 
For while, clear one either 'vaccine treadmill' 'reinfection treadmill' latter implies so, much Long-COVID. mean, people saying mixed bag data, even saying bad, think huge early signs boosters 5% 90%. two shots less 6months like kids became eligible recently. Thank link. Last tried looking hard time getting info. still know many boosters need spaces be? Yep. did. got bunch PCS'ing Korea, sent Desert Shield/Desert Storm. one bitched. bad ""unvaccinated"" also includes people received two shots. Ro faster mean? Due lucky medical intervention survived. literally hours dying - like, understand significance right? high risk yet still would died waited little bit longer. address edit, given concerns immune escape new variant, light symptoms early phase infection doesn’t necessarily tell us much. hopeful, shouldn’t delude immature data. worry, already got virus, felt nothing mild symptoms, want risk further.  shut borders EU / UK even cases low. US enough people vaccinated. Nowhere near enough. know holiday weekend really surprised relaxed are. target variant try prevent spread know is. Definitely good news. Let's hope see more. force native African population take vaccine rejected bulk population? Look riots SA year happened nothing. happens government try force people take vaccine? Duuuude change oil! 😂 mean Gov. Ron ""I slurp dog cum"" DeSantis? want sure talking guy here. ""where everyone goes"" serious oversell malls LA days Yeah, someone autoimmune disease injects monthly, soon weekly, I’m hard time mustering outrage COVID booster shot. 

This year already I’ve flu shot, diphtheria, tetanus pertussis booster, pneumococcal booster two (almost three) covid shots. I’m really getting drama. Yeah it’s really sad haven’t found it. really wonder Florida real source variants since they’ve couple bad outbreaks Lovely Source? Worst, say vaccine actually increases chance get covid... clean gutters every 6 months? Make Iron Lungs Great Again! doesn’t prove point. stated “no different unvaccinated”. 

I don’t need provide source, didn’t make claim. time testing arrivals. wish expanded airports 4 listed countries. May 12 2021 12-15, right on! slightly concerning 0.04% chance death single dose vaccine. I’ve left flank pain, lower left stomach pain. Came second vaccine. Doctor said it’s costochondritis. Anyone else heard happening? freaking time.  basing on? I’m genuinely curious Sure, risk reward trade off, case serves strong purpose. Applying rules also applies social pressure folks get vaccine, key strategy exiting pandemic. 



So really, benefits around people get vaccinated, flights safer (due less risks vaccinated only), flight economy ramps back travelers feel safer knowing vaccines mandatory. makes difference economy destroyed unwarranted travel bans. countries mentioned still covid, even reported case rate low

because countries keep introducing it. Illinois US 33 years old, got booster Romania. Unfortunately vaccination rates much lower rest UE might reason mRNA vaccines basically available anyone. made booster appt. line spent 3 minutes pharmacy get flu shot. waiting 15 minutes left time consuming part. look, find, pretend OK ✉ 900 dead kids US, many long Covid Covid induced diabetes heart issues… plus don’t know happen long term even mild cases. Many “survivable” diseases cause terrible things later life shingles chicken pox encephalitis post measles. Also children infect people. 

The BS narrative don’t concerned children damaging based reality. Source? dream first popped San Francisco. Woke relieved stateside yet gonna happen rich western countries keep boosting population 

1 moderna shot cost 10 johnson johnson doses correct. vaccines health. vaccine protecting people. (If risk group). 

That's half true. Like vaccines, protect recipient well others. recipient protected drastically less likely infected disease vaccinated against. protect others drastically less likely spread disease. covid specific feature first time history vaccine like forced people.

During revolutionary war, George Washington mandated smallpox vaccine fort troops. US military litteraly always vaccine mandate. Today US, recruits vaccinated enter military. get decide vaccines Netherlands covid vaccine first vaccine history government government advices take protect people. That's massive difference previous vaccines.

I cannot speak Netherlands government, vaccine (like vaccines) specific protecting others. Bad good different discussion. pointing major difference. People want take covid vaccine opinion reason necessarily anti vaxxers. (I vaccinated get hate)

I agree general case, general case. specific military. Discharges offered refuse compliance. general discharge. Also, many people taking covid vaccine covid already, can't take it, children. make problem. 

Again, specific military. joining military required follow orders taking vaccines part that. requirement specific Let's get along everybody. forget humanity. goes ways.

I'll drink that. certainly espouse hatred, people requirement fulfill members military. bribe someone. agree you, take issue data uses ""unvaccinated"" wastebasket term anyone 0 2 shots. there's differentiation unvaccinated unboosted vaccinated, communicate public, especially naysayers conspiracy theorists? terrible messaging. Yes. Botswana sample taken Nov 9 allegedly, ""discovered"" last week due testing lag time. data far Botswana. time could traced elsewhere seems. Hopefully trace fist Netherlands sample like Botswana one. Lol Jesus Christ. Well hope good. Somebody get PhD someday tracing jet bridge super spreaders scientist generally proud genomics work US, find really disappointing. It’s here. 100%. WGS wastewater. sequence thousands samples short amount time liquid handling robots. NGS multiplex sequencing. It’s one sample time. target dropout positives. embarrassing. History tells us point new variant come along hyper transmissible, causes less serious symptoms. outcompete variants, become dominant form covid 19. 

The problem timeline long take... title: basis? read today ""addressing"" variant issue ongoing work. Denmark lot. believe Austria too, I’m sure twice dangerous original strain, delta covid kill father? guess fall 0.01% category then. Great news. gonna terrible winter state. need learn Hebrew. truly need invest increased ventilation UV sanitization air handlers. virus going away anytime soon others follow. really don’t think will. can’t anything, Europe block him. extremely odd fixation wanting blame Biden nations preventing this. Normal one checking giving f. health protocols arrival? think people’s tolerance get regularly vaccinated varies. That's still way lower we've warned about. experts speculating 500% infectious. know getting downvoted telling truth. Even Netherlands confirmed variant present detected South Africa, also countries (not South Africa) happen near South Africa banned despite ZERO cases Omicron far.

If bans racists travel European countries Frankly easier things every six months, judging fact I'm boosted done last 2 years. think still counted vaccinated within 6 month window It’s reply op. 

OP weird, confirmed cases Europe, aren’t banned.

Hinting policy racist, opposed strategic.

You show voters anyway.

Inciting Canada racist, banning African nations whilst European nations clear.  would make sense surveil Miami vs Houston Dallas Miami's high numbers Caribbean south America arrivals. yeah, states need break covid. [Current CDC Booster 18 6 months since Moderna Pfizer shot 2 months since J&amp;J shot recommended get booster now. current US guidance. Why? They're barely risk? protected well equally 3 shot fully vaxxed still booster 'waiting space' ""fully vaxxed""?  children???? 5 still able get vaxxed. Sorry, appreciate information. I'm still terrified little one. many people, including kids. wish would hurry studies kids, want right, dichotomy stressing fuck me. Sorry. omicron persei 8  unapproved, think pediatrician would answer? ""Normal"" nodoby cared checking airport still pandemic? better R 36 went viral twitter days ago based shoddy statistics (seriously scientists need discuss biases posting fear monger R) CDC clear this:

Who get booster:
Everyone 18 years older

When get booster:
At least 6 months completing primary COVID-19 vaccination series.

Which booster get?
Any COVID-19 vaccines authorized United actually deficit leadership. lady ""checking"" covid results exiting plane gave us flyer advising us get tested. otherwise pretty normal. anything checking covid results made things worse caused entire plane cramped jet bridge zero ventilation. 10% number taking account lot people yet qualified take since wait 6 months 2nd dose?  publishers profit handsomely institutional subscriptions. gone far trouble much less important payoffs. driven farther waited longer paid beer. Yeah, likely correct unfortunately! It’s leaders. It’s us too.

People, broadly speaking, terrible engaging problems immediate reaching kind tangible crisis point. 

There lot reasons this, I’m trying justify make moral issue it.  think feeling measure ownership problem productive— care something then, care something now.  Let us make different. data saw specific date range, e.g. dates x-y boosters administered 1st/2nd shots. That’s happened though. decision wasn’t revealed year couldn’t anything public’s trust eroded due constant political propaganda campaigns.

Further, point masks recommended, virus presences population small overall, masks supply desperately needed hospitals.

Finally, masks aren’t really effective keeping specific individual getting infected. effectiveness manifests aggregate. eventual mask recommendation isolated policy decision, part larger “flatten curve” strategy included quarantine, stay home orders, mask recommendations mandates, referencing hospital capacity. mask recommendation makes sense part larger framework. centuries old precedent relates state’s authority enact vaccine mandates federal authority. mandate put place CMS OSHA. ""Australian Government says...""

Spotted problem Stevo. mean 2-3 days work sick

Where people getting information? Omicron field day India make permanent day COVID cure discovered. people riding roller coaster infections: goes safety rules get relaxed, goes rules back. annoying worse gives people give shit excuse wear it. permanent COVID gone cure, even that's never. Olympics closed door, athletes media allowed exit Olympic village don’t even really get set hours rate

Technically contractor can't set hours rate. based case positivity rates though? understanding Omicron much prevalent South Africa slowing transmission could potentially time. Disney World trip planned next week. still safe?

RemindMe! 1 week 1 year 8 months point stands. Gargling mouthwash help, Covid. good oral health lessens chance sore throat caused minor infections. Less chance false alarm. even example. even 20 people. Jesus, noteable referenceable representative anything. 

Please stop talking sh*t data clearly something know nothing about. you’re vaccinated, get booster 6 month mark live life.  mean? UK 95%+ people antibodies either via infection vaccination, ever gonna better this? Add protection want worry others choose do. Seems like great approach me. already two cases transmission UK significant spread? weird. Either variant transmissible everyone thinks incredibly long incubation period cases outliers incubation periods shorter. Get what's available today. six months, immunity established variants much still waning. There's sense waiting months hypothetical tweaked version could increase base resistance right now. Covid never going away. ridiculous expect people wear mask forever. Local officials keep insisting mask mandate end horizon need wear mask little longer. dishonest ridiculous. Covid going away unreasonable require people wear mask rest lives. I’m getting hopes Mardi Gras 2022 yet. Obama moderately severely immunocompromised case would get full additional shot. getting regular booster still 6 months. 2nd Moderna shot worse either number 1 number 3. think close behind number 1. immune system already primed goes overboard. six month wait, booster hit nearly hard, least that's theory. Sore arm that's it. Looks like prevailing flu year type A. guys know years flu vaccine protects good?  Come Texas lol. first jab, lot smaller cities towns tons vaccines. sure looking like boosters surprised case. don’t pretend. give guidance evidence surfaces. honest evolving virus?

You didn’t mention Trump. pushed misinformation, racism, national factioning, fucking bleach. veins. Gtfo bs. worried people stay extra hours Disneyland order get PCR tested? worried hundreds thousands Americans *died* CoVID-19, millions Chinese people would die Chinese government followed advice.

I'm means supporter Chinese government, zero-CoVID policy extremely successful, level Sinophobia that's developed West since Trump elected really disturbing. I'm surprised Omicron sequenced yet  Yes helps, time Christmas rolls around, Omicron spread many places fact they're stationed South Africa make threat stationed America. Depending quickly variant moves burns out, also possible people South Africa could less exposed countries.

Just take deep breath every time feel overwhelmed wait see things develop. know Christmas whether safe not, make call today. 18 month old terrified getting well, know exactly feel. 100% is. opened international travel November 8th. Since day Disney World absolutely jam packed. today noticed drop guests mean popular, right? people get Covid once, happening? catching different strain antibodies extinguished? Bit jump? Quite bit WNY double numbers compare last years. I'm really wondering omicron variant detected rapid antigen detection tests Thank you, OP! people panicking assuming worst news good clarify things. South Africa plenty vaccines. They're problem getting arms. Getting booster vaccine deprive someone else agree last part. Unless fully vaccinated requirement get in, go indoors dining. outdoors delivery. sucks need respect virus.   do! also add welfare, food stamps, unemployment, etc. become poor starve death That’s pretty much I’m at. wouldn’t piss fire. I’m certainly going stop going gym stop social. rules country /apply/ WH visa still 30 (i.e. potentially weeks leading 31st birthday) still good. may leg upto 4 years.

Even Omicron thing goes bad I'm sure worst case COVID another fly type seasonal disease (albeit slightly worse).

Chin up! true terrible attitude. It’s even comparable events all…. 

Also others suffered past, ok suffer like wtf way satisfy indefinitely shutting indoor hospitality, even remotely feasible. point transition solution problem… building hospitals hiring staff?

Supply nurses physicians limited. can't hire staff. training time nurses physicians huge.

While individual hospital acquire staff increasing wages, overall could opposite effect. every hospital decides double wages, workforce might respond working *less*, since people find marginal utility money declines rapidly get it. You’re right, shouldn’t dismiss possibility mutated literal HIVeboleases.  I'm sure moreso country. know donated somewhere around 10M doses far pledged 200M end next year. may sound small population small too. Per capita works 1.5-2x USA donate. 

I scheduled booster February, understand many countries freely offering boosters now. much supply available (though may higher percentage 1st &amp; 2nd doses vs. countries). 

Ultimately, western world done enough, Canada included. Distribution far equitable straight gate wasn't, still mess time. ex-FDA directors current physician member FDA vaccine advisory board make case scheduled booster tomorrow Walmart. There's many different replies idea do. That’s refuse pay more. forced stay inside? live North Korea China? Oh Give essential workers bonuses like unemployed provide every small business 100% compensation lost income lockdowns mind actual lockdown. Exactly 🤣 obvious exceptions. need treat myriad issues obesity causes either.

Hospitals practically empty rate vax come eventually. Soon happens there's need even bother measures except maybe masks states feel inclined. want get COVID even booster accept lockdowns going fix anything. Masks best defense unvaxxed continue roll dice that's them. 3 year old soon protect really care anyone else bad politics anyone else either, Biden admin wisely too. Well, tell me, look I’m surprised it’s low. friend RT believe making $33-39 hour. (Tidewater area). speaks something early:

WHO speak quickly enough something:

They're bad guys totally commission 3 days booster. (Modera) people can't take kind time off. work communications average Redditor idea messaging shaped. CDC one relatively small department federal agency (Health Human Services) within executive branch. means whatever message delivered public goes staff CDC, HHS White House, possibility consultation congressional staff states. That’s lot cooks kitchen would bet whatever emerges process looks nothing like CDC’s original draft. Blaming CDC incoherent messaging mark. people get frustrated, imagine much would suck defend messaging little control over. WWII bad, six years

now Dark Ages, *that* real deal Heard RT-PCR detect Omicron. No, don’t. tired public needs put fucking big-boy pants. hate Africans?  Nothing. Yet. That's start I’m couple months away graduating (as nurse damn things) situation certainly going change. guess I’ll fortunate night shifts option feel ya. feels like great choices anymore. Nahh Comes triage end. medical system need care capacity provide care medical system needs decide people deny.

The argument, then, essentially put unvaccinated bottom triage list. Take care there's capacity. isn't, new demand shows up, deprioritize people need care.

Cancer patients, people car accidents, domestic violence victims, etc. stuck without care assholes lied vaccines facebook. hinting could 15% mortality rate? Lmao Best exercise caution since know full details new variant yet  People Michigan outside May mid-September typical year rest year weather horrible. coincided Delta surge southern US. unusually warm early fall, slow ramp Delta leading Halloween, weather suddenly reverted mean. Everyone went inside BOOM. Michigan's Delta wave. Booster shot today, 6 hours nothing, even site soreness. Imagine believing unvaccinated people don’t care anyone else. exactly wait ""eligible"" according anyone me. nyc.  Wife went many restaurants, vax card shown stupid. course schools mandate vaccines, they've done ages.   Go. let anti-vaxxers run life. got shots, protected be.  carnival-goers cheerful. city used stop full week. work, fun. husband back work full time. work home one day week nanny/my mom help order keep daycare constantly worried exposing him. One us *could* quit jobs would lifestyle change enjoy working. don’t know I’m going work variant bad think. Bc business require it. see many businesses going back requiring it. way things going we'll lucky enough medical staff even cover normal needs.

There vicious cycle could fall into.

1) Hospital enough nurses, hire traveling nurses huge cost. 

2) Traveling nurses get huge gobs money start stashing away retirement accounts and/or using take breaks. 

3) Shortage worsens. GOTO Line 1  scores impact reimbursement understand extent sucks. customer centric beyond me. created toxic culture. Yeah ok. knock door asking supplies. fine Michigan experiencing high numbers opposed places low vaccination rate?  live? Omg Well hope appetite comes back remove piles dead people streets. Someone's gotta eat stuff worms really tired hear. expect influx realtors? Fun facts.... ""lockdowns"" worked drove numbers time lows...

Then declared independence virus (*in u.s.) and....

Watched cases explode over.

""Fact"" countries cases, still makes lot sense. 2% 2% I'm glad say CDC advice situation simple ages 18 older get booster shot

If recovered, get vaccinated boosted, UNLESS COVID-19 treated monoclonal antibodies convalescent plasma. case, wait 90 can't called Nu again?  Omicron we're back againnnnnn
Brothers Sisters everybody singgg Still great got 90+, yeah way high. wish exemptions harder. Could worth calling Japanese embassy closest getting passport. Citizens able come go since start, doesn’t seem change that. would need quarantine upon arrival however. Unlikely. they’re hospitalized, there’s good chance PCR part labs would noticed bunch weird samples. Michigan, like Colorado “just” experiencing Delta. Lockdowns reasonable vaccine arrives. completely pointless going forward. AZ, husband pretty much ones wear masks inside restaurants. take eat. We're def getting another mask mandate around parts.  5-11yo got approved pfizer.

Places Moderna slots community. Bout time Get booster. don’t know when/if Omicron become dominant. Meanwhile delta still there. Pfizer CEO stated would take 100 days get tweaked vaccine decision made so. yet make call. Good luck that. Instead take sudaphed tell anyone they're sick. Well, answer. No, milder"" version. yes, going get bad. Moderna Pfizer better come something soon, looks like whole world high doo Doo pretty soon.  Yes journalists queuing emulate impeccable transparent writing style. Not. know, right? every SINGLE case, enough put behind bars die old age. 200 years plenty, even they're vegan. Bro don’t go lock step CDC Fauci says you’re one (anti vaxxer). 

Don’t want go back normal? Fauci said last last booster go back normal! Don’t wanna go back normal? Cmon man, one one last jab go back normal. 

/s Maybe. Maybe not. Delta spread SUPER fast discovered well. 

Superspread events really impactful. key thing vaccinated folks seem pretty well-protected far. buys us time better understand impact overall. 

It changes literally nothing personally long vaccinated. office answered signing 15 year lease facilities said don’t know make office workers integrated home….

Like seriously dumbass, call desk zoom like do.  think hick ever NYC? 2 feet 4 different people whole time there. Yep, attitude entitled exceptionalism unfortunately common. think that's required. vaccine, adjusted variant like annual flu vaccine.  see bit argument integration new hires general comraderie staff. benefits face time want go back occassionally. looks like twice month. 3 days in, 2 days (or worse) proposals company has. Yeah. hope going bad people saying. feeling bad people saying. Hope best, prep worst. love comments citations back lmao focus current crisis next… worst situation pandemic Europe currently. sure got downvoted, it’s true. There’s widespread nationalist/anti-globalization movement world right Trump vocal proponent  Yes that's reason country making 4% entire world population donated vaccines 96% world combined.

Simple people need simple explanations guess. Seems pediatric cases rising Nov 11th... 

A 54% increase since Nov 3rd, reported 18th.... 

Weirrrrd.(Detroit free press) also great surveillance program found Omicron fast. 

But majority African countries surrounding SA even worse vaccination rates - 0-2%. likely cooked nearby detected SA first. countries 0-2% def vaccines handle that’s case might be-it’s possible hospitalization rate lower there’s many infected.

The point moot hospitals overflow though Yep. broad range issue police per se, nurse navigated hundreds crazy/delirious/A-hole/you name situations people acting dangerously plainly say never kill anyone it. don’t even beating stick every one situations managed, albeit mostly medications (which guess cops don’t have) Exactly. excelsior checks NY vaccination records (it find mine instance, I'm dc area). nyc covid safe shows uploaded jpg.

I think there's CLEAR version it, country. sure tho  Time tell, freak statistic discovery makes probable seriously contagious current strains. would depend entirely plays out. right know. would say steps taken follow best science ideology dumbass governor leader. Agreed. know one person got J&amp;J never got another dose anything, I'm assuming they're only. Time add protection. Wild. figured SA sequenced first. they’re first see surging hospitalizations, perhaps actually mutate well.  Yep - think order USA regain semblance functioning government civic society, it'll need move away laissez-faire approach taken towards free speech, political polarization, etc.

That'll likely require painful authoritarian measures (which many could argue worth it), without it, think USA eventually veer anti-intellectual authoritarianism anyways  Went back summer. Quit went company offered full-time remote. Never happier knowing don’t commute snow don’t pay care. accusation MSM downplaying omicron? Lies, damn lies statistics. national ego massage China numbers surely getting good massage too.

Maybe that’s it’s great comparison. mean people take masks soon get table. people put back walk bathroom I’ve seen people don’t. obviously varies place place. New York that’s I’ve seen. Yeah figured dangerous since pretty dilute. skeptical would effective. don’t take eat drink, seated stay it’s time leave go bathroom (and even it’s 50/50). 

This experience living somewhere still mask mandate harshest restrictions North America. fatality rate vacated people people 50 0.0 per 100,000, done me. Omicron going less lethal us hype clicks. know early know wait ""two weeks"". seeing 82%? MayoClinic [70% 1 shot 59.5% fully vaccinated bad wish prompt recovery.

Experiences like make me, layman, think maybe vaccines much. Getting sick even well booster shot worrisome.

But trust science 100% existence made possible it. know getting dire dip strategic national maple syrup reserves. U4 unemployment probably relevant discussion, though.

The ""other marginally attached"" folks going competing jobs, discouraged workers likely start applying pretty quickly industry trouble filling slots.

However, leaves part time workers there's going degree folks looking well.

Eh, kinda hyped taking 5y old see fireworks Rio end year, think that's going canceled too.

Two years shit, I'm tired, need proper vacations family. vague recollection.

It SA doctor who'd seen 20 patients, mostly symptoms fatigue/tiredness right? nice thought, virus weaker.

I suspect we're 1-2 weeks away really clear data. No, FDA's fault. past two days taught anything, hundreds thousands people expect fifth wave *at all*. 

My non-scientific intuition felt maybe something would happen January-March. It’s set back three six months, longevity pending. One step forward...

~~Two~~ ten steps 100 days get us back December 2020

Comments like surely imply thinks that. least California there's shortage nurses barrier degree required AA, legislation surrounding AA imposes limit number seats school nursing program every year. That's creates shortage. using CDC data discussion UK? don’t understand response said.  Compare chart 2020 time last year matches almost identically. early declare anything. guess it’s easy say strong side effects. Saying need boosters every 6 months losing strategy.

Go get help man. I'm stranger internet, there's hope world's better place it.   110m fully vaccinated 6 months ago today. Roughly 1/3 (37m) received booster shots. Considering 6 month difference 21/28 day difference going exact follow up.  


You see another spike shortly Christmas. Yes ppe keeps cash carrying customers alive purchase said maple syrup Despite many adverbial phrases sentence fine. need mental help, I’m serious. isn’t normal. Yes definitive evidence yet. opinion speculations worlds top doctors. would hardly term ‘good news’ lol, china’s effort colonise Africa Probably “I don’t like wearing mask don’t wear one won’t”. Perfectly reasonable.  many americans anti vax morons. waffle back forth long time. hope people paying attention now. Masks aren’t required places live. Mostly it’s people won’t get vaccinated wear masks. complain businesses closed won’t minimum — demanding service restaurants require inspections food handling certificates hepatitis vaccines cooks. 

I can’t figure out. 

I’m fired told masks “too uncomfortable” guys who’ve never unfastened bra, much less wear one fourteen hour shift. That’s case mRNA vaccines. Since it’s small change data vaccine rather vaccine itself, approval require shortened ph1/2 trials like seasonal flu shots. Lol, think employers want fresh grads? Employers *lazy* - don’t want train new workers. Employers *greedy* - still think it’s 2012 get employees 10 years experience entry level positions. positivity rates 0_0 Either way, worse gets, tension be. riots Europe blow mind. anti intellectualism runs whole gamut though think. friend who’s stuff. He’s also super US politics “stop steal” unrelated tangentially affiliated things. It’s like form team group think ideology are, reality, vapid one yourself. start see similarities stuff. l take sips here, re-mask.

This delusional, I’m sorry. you’re making think safe. I'm sorry loss Happened New York Yankees Delta. cases hospitalizations vaccination status. Though note since using seronegative even case negative value, per-capita numbers unvaccinated lump naive recovered together risk factor dramatically higher naive unvaccinated.

If kind question get vaccinated, answer should. Holy sensitive bot, batman. Lemme try little gently:

While agree sentiment, actual article linked AP. 
 
They (along handful outlets) absolutely ones putting kind information. PanicNewsAndNipSlipDaily.com ilk stop. I'm glad hear No, T/B-cells mount much comprehensive response, it’s antibodies narrowly focus spike thus get easily fooled mutations spike. [I recommend think it’s holding fine. Employers want fresh grads useless degrees internships. got degree least one internship, employable. Haha fair enough. many people Australia talk ""TWO YEARS THIS"" (and done last six months) nothing actually happened Australia March 2020 it’s middle managers. Actually don’t think even middle managers. It’s senior execs way CEO want people back person. “rant” percentages isn’t wrong. You’re completely confused. 

So let’s try again. I’ll go slow. 10 children every 1000 cases go hospital, 1000 cases week, means 10 children went hospital. 

Now it’s next week 2000 cases week. many children would expect go hospital week? 20. Right? average, 10 children every 1000 cases go hospital. 

How much increase 1000 2000? That’s 100 percent increase. 

How much increase 10 20? That’s 100 percent increase. 

Now, maybe math off. seem believe is. could point specifically where, please? mean, apparently know “I’m wrong”. could point specifically I’m wrong?  Hawaii fully vaccinated proof vaccinated card, Safe Travels, negative covid result (proof too). solution get vaccinated wear masks.


It’s difficult.  agree you, indeed variant turned infectious, deadly, escaped vaccine (unlikely possible) would likely looking lockdowns again.

So completely valid say soon know sure. That's really means Omicron boosters many months. Omicron surge likely happen long then. Yeah, people can't get vaccinated medical reasons denied medical treatment. brilliant idea.  got Pfizer, dose. Straight start turning away unvaxxed covid patients room people urgent needs you. yep, love us! Still makes asshole. Masks required live either, people wear assholes. Masks protect others singling give shit people. That's people give side eye. Yes, Covid omicron seems terms symptoms. get vaccinated stop posting article whenever new case it. people pretend like steer pandemic companies using spaces that. But, companies suddenly needing 20% (or 40%) less office space huge deal commercial real estate market. It’s already felt brokers, landlords, operators… think it’s getting started Would state happen California? COVID sick leave allowed lapse heat Delta surge. Facepalm. everyone knows Omicron show US week. Anyone care wager state shows first?  I’m sure *really* show Texas Florida first, conceal keep mind. Anyone care place bets? I’m becoming increasingly convinced there’s way avoid mass death, everything we’ve done try avoid made things worse. 77 Omicron genomes obtained.  
Omnicron causes S-gene target failure PCR assays though, that's 90% cases allegedly  Ok thanks, figured since. Yes, vaccines immunity via prior infection grant cellular immunity. recognize even Omicron. antibodies may get fooled, bad terms controlling transmission idea we're going get hospitals filling fully vaccinated (especially boosted) previously infected patients - really, really likely. Moderna lower dose booster. half original dose. Maybe publicized convince people get one. Covid lots appetite lakes often keep us warmer Minnesota Maybe losing job life lesson needs. Two years in, argument loses luster? *actual wars* longer clearly worse pretenses.

I hope get continue live blissful ignorance actually feels like 'life' 'happens' Covid terms, around you... Exactly. climate much Michigan similar, usually cold Minnesota, Ontario upstate New York. Oklahoma really far south us climate little like ours. No, get booster now. current threat winter surge delta. Waiting puts community risk. omicron becomes dominant different booster needed, wouldn’t available quantity March earliest that’s late winter surge. Current booster likely protection omicron, question much.

Worst case scenario- get booster protect winter omicron booster becomes necessary. get it’s available. (No 6 mo wait that, targets different antigen)  Lol cool Mostly Elon Musk agree governments reactions unlike alpha delta variant. 

I remember much farther ahead year ago. vaccinated people ahead pro-COVID antivaxxers too. good give another 2 million, 2 million more, 2 million 13 million vaccinated  Oklahoma 11th warmest state country. Michigan 40th.  :) That's crazy, know high already! said, think there's mix people following 2nd shots records messed up. records messed fought 3 months resubmitting records CA vaccination website could get records updated. fully vaccinated, probably adding stats people 1 shot. surprised closer 75%+ fully vaxxed instead around 70% 18+. Oh God cares live Michigan today one handful people masking stores, etc. school mask mandate. lot people resent sort mitigation. I'll remind group crazy people stopped assassinating governor. us still care keep trying rest given up. Get booster ASAP. Delta us still taking people there. awhile know Omicron shot.  Also - people keep forgetting one main reasons lockdown was….. PPE shortage.

We know virus spreads masks protect transmission. world awash masks, face shields, cleaning supplies, hand sanitizer toilet paper.

Mask mandates suffice unless truly doomsday worst ever disease variant. Vaccine rates Africa roughly 25% whole 7% provence substantial spread....

There nothing vaccinated people could find link. know behaves vaccinated people.  I'll guess of: NY/NJ/CT/PA (NYC metro), GA (Atlanta metro - another huge air hub), IL (Chicago) 1st report. West coast seems unlikely I'm thinking direct flights Europe &amp; Africa. We'll see... It'll still definitely problem. vaccines continue work, though, rate hospitalization similar variants virus, play regular COVID wave though, right? course know sure ""ifs"" true, assuming are, logic follow missing something? one point 800 deaths one day think yesterday zero. ""to avail?"" Masks vaccinations working us. We're going tighten everything see new thing acts. big deal.  read wrote way there? agree Mr. Pedantic Pants' snarkiness, one period whole thing. wouldn’t opposed won’t would final nail left coffin 2022 2024 elections. Flu shot rate low considering completely voluntary mandated, pretty darn high even relative COVID shots. Also think flu vaccine marketed. heavily emphasized kids seniors, groups vaccination rate generally pretty high.

The thing country recommend universal vaccination, many countries including EU, even countries there's lot prioritization around children seniors making generally ""do whatever want"" healthy adult.

I'd argue geography big impact certain regions (generally colder regions people stay indoors) super high flu rates whereas warmer regions generally impacted. I'll even go far admit so-so getting vaccine. Sometimes I'd it, times lazy get it. Living CA, neve serious warmer here, travel colder places like MN, WI, etc? huddled day blasted dry heater air day long.... man easiest places get sick. Agreed, mean keep hearing ""there need even lie"" that's true us. got mine today thanks governor declaring entire state ""high risk"" weeks ago grabbed earliest convenient appt could. everything local booked weeks. well friend!  That's true too. pretending like effective lol. heard radio afternoon China giving Southern Africa 1 BIllion doses Covid vaccine. Nah fucking jumping jacks, hold breath stores I’ve meditation hiking. Therapy huge help too. yeah, don’t think us ever get back before. try keep safe. half legislators rely crazy peoples' votes, bottle attempts pass laws like that.  Well surprised sort thing still happening. comes lockdowns apparently vaccines government treat secular religious entities differently.

For example can't shut churches keep say bowling allies open.

Can't prohibit religious exemptions giving exemptions non medical reasons secular people. Thanks! China going economic win Civ, need African Nations stop producing variants get back track. make sound colder Oklahoma, Kentucky Kansas. hospitals give nurses doctors break! Anyone still unvaccinated becomes infected denied treatment! believe science vaccine believe science save covid! 
Excluding medically qualify vaccine. Except whole mRNA vaccine applied solid tumor cancers thing. took forever find doctor town willing take new patient, even then, appointment 12 weeks out. 

It's even worse veterinarians - vets town taking new patients, even emergencies, main 24 hour vet biggest city taking patients they're essentially half-dead, even triaged, often forced wait days seen. extremely effective 3-dose vaccine.

Meanwhile US makes 80 million doses month intention scaling become world leader again. idea contraption existed! Yikes. I'll take needle day. think look current temps, states listed much warmer Michigan. quick check, Detroit currently 32, Des Moines 53, Topeka 51, OKC 58. I’m sure you’re asking. think recommended everyone 2+ months ago constantly shifting eligibility criteria arbitrarily excluding 10% people silly best. said said, congrats perfect health risk factors!  Thank kind stranger. Yes, right compatible strategies. brother retired last year (a years early), year (caught Covid, burnt out, etc) time said planning leaving, hospital increased hourly wage. 

Ultimately, still worth it.  situation basically upstate. I’m Dutchess county, we’re little higher 3% 43 hospitalizations county, number hospitals. Anecdotally don’t think that’s true. wife able get boosters live NYC. able get next day. got 2 weeks ago, got mine today. Lots countries longer lockdowns. It’s US 2 years it, argument loses luster. Long COVID sucks, definitely. want talk shifting goal posts…. we’re talking locking “figure out” long term side effect? We’re either going figure solution we’re not. 

We’ve 68 deaths nationwide 5 age group since start pandemic. Compared 65 flu. “Think children” nice emotional argument doesn’t move needle rational, nation wide policy making.

Delta didn’t come anything did. came that’s life sometimes shit happens. Nah. states management. Feds useless. Sometimes suspects trying kill police. last wave finally pushed leave ICU. covid patients/families assault coworkers. safe patient ratios went shit lost staff added rooms ICU. One night ran ventilators. least per shift coworker would break down. took turns seemed. Every shift felt like war zone somehow worse previous shift. I'd leave work everyone living life like nothing happening. like gaslit entire world. 

I'm Tele health great. I'm still ok. I'm sure I'll ever ok again. sure hope so. God hope so. sign waiver? it’s antivaxxers filling hospitals, really point - every single vaccinated person strictly complied restrictions new (/reintroduced) regulations, would slightly lessen strain healthcare resources, vast majority hospitalizations people refuse get vaccine. MSM downplaying playing Omicron. I've heard read points view. think people eager know something outlets want among first give us new information, even half ends true. make Michigan sound like Antarctica. It’s 39/30 today, Boston colder today would rather risk another 2020 style lockdown. would rather risk another 2020 style lockdown. CDC say anything 65+ only. cared enough would've seen requirements included work risks well health risks.

You're trying blame CDC information wide open. curious found out. know, even amongst peers know, one's bitter it. Oh tight. saw whole lot “INFORMATIVE” comments, obviously “They’re seriously suggesting masks TB outbreaks??” Deserved removal. wonder everyone’s left gone COVID-19 subreddit. Peace ✌🏻 allow commentary fucks sake, wasn’t starting fights attack idea. Ridiculous.  still think that’s misleading cause parents super careful children take hospital often themselves. Interested seeing death rate though  Ehh nurse, it’s like 2 years. know people gonna say it’s longer it’s really not. anywhere close doctor level 

I knew people 18 month BSN programs ICU nurses 2 months graduation  logic likely evades *antibodies*, reducing protection symptomatic contagious infection nearly zero (as happened delta *when* breakthroughs happened), leaving protective immunity mostly intact. every respiratory virus get reinfected every 8 years.

The question severe reinfections breakthroughs be. Interesting. seen take anywhere. sources? realize government wrong Well, vaccines disappointing stopping infections. dream using vaccines achieve herd immunity dead, rely protect individuals. what? Everyone staying home? exactly thing without it? way better moderna stock current dose good omicron. idea think ineffective would bode better moderna. That’s work research, might even pan out. Fuck ‘em… travel nurse, sounds good  I’m expert it’s least feb omnicron booster available, it’ll take month get unless high risk. vaccines 6 month waiting period maximize immune response, one similar. didn’t way bc would delayed approval 6 months. strongly recommend go get it. (I training expertise, read lot.). kind get? Moderno higher amount vaccine per dose ohizer it’s little effective. omnicron anywhere near predicted infectiousness it’ll infectious disease planet. Even measles. 5 min bus would infect whole bus measles. Satire? Depends country talking about. country like UK able avoid brunt war physical separation, *civilians* 0.14% chance dying war 6 years. Covid killed 0.2% UK less half time bigger population. course participated directly war places like Poland, there's comparison; clearly war far far worse. 

But diseases face, intent, spectacle war mean dismiss lesser threat. black death makes world wars look like pleasant experience comparative death percentages. Slow there, going make next…hand socks?! matter long till starts america sad suggest read studies carefully. effectiveness partial countey specific bans total prevelence virus within country either unstudied focus importation one country. large part argument presented. time individual countries identified virus almost certainly already countries. introduce virus country community spread matter time. 

Something need remember country specific partial travel bans cost associated it. question whether cost worth delayed infection curve. everything I've read epidemiologists organizations like cost worth benefit. Doctors take YEARS train. 

Also places doctors leaving. blame them, they've treating Covid patients risking lives nearly two years. Yet see people get vaccinated wear masks throw tantrums would embarrass parents toddler. Beta. lucky delta relegated beta back can’t keep slamming vaccines someone’s body.

Well, can. Yearly boosters likely thing this. boosters even work towards variant? even know serious variant is? 

We know either. previous vaccines provide protection we're sure. could anything 5% 80%. definitely higher 0% though. article shows next nothing. 

Because know know while. Please Germany. 3 million people 60 vaxxed right, thing ordinary people really power make kinds large scale institutional changes needed. vote people will, many us live countries even table. No, different branches levels government reason. One prevent overreach jurisdiction unilateral order single branch (executive branch president) supported local governments there’s chance lockdown could put effect. 

Honestly US held together string duct tape point. whole mask mandate thing showed clearly police decide stop enforcing certain laws feel like that’s kind scary thought. 

Also showed easily US fractured pockets governmental hell crazy enough people get put office local state governments. Ah, duh. forgot early. Thank you. countries still locking provide protection, know much. could 5%, 20%, 70%. Ah, vaccine diplomacy.

It's good thing many African countries. Xi's motives may complicated vaccines developed China work.   funny comparison, town burned down. firefighters didn’t bother save houses. Why? Cause fucked everyone knew it

Problem solved. Bypasses vaccines. spreading fast, never vaccine.

So kill you, wish dead.

Everyone's going catch covid now, vaccinated not.

We watch mothers sister suffer heavy coughing, lack breath energy. 

We able help them.

Economy forced shut again, whether like not, sick work. hit March 2022. going bad. 

Fauci moderna say vaccines going struggle. 

Anyone vaccinated 1000% done now. Like actually done. Really wish info new variant, got booster week ago could start playing basketball again. Going super sad cancel 😔 conjecture point let's hope agree points, probably get rid bit Pfizer stock. Pfizer much much larger company moderna back then, can’t compare two companies price trading lol point different people value different things. people drink friends pub spice life. others watching Netflix.

Governments enacting travel bans, gearing worst telling us ""keep calm get vaccinated."" governments telling keep calm... mean *should* panic makes shit worse. sign concerned.

Unsurprisingly, life time incarcerated petty crimes trust government authority trusted enough go get it. entirely give up. we're seeing South Africa right now, vaccines still appear pretty effective far, every single severe case among unvaccinated. headline interesting. know several nurses quitting it’s unvaccinated patients putting nurses staff danger. Take ""Canada"" replace country infected omicron. Smh. Way evade point. ban travel for, end employment unvaccinated people vaccinated people bringing fresh variants anyway? understanding they're less exact thing, except Moderna higher dosage. slightly better getting Moderna. really, best vaccine one get arm now. kinda allowed 95 countries manufacture pill. importantly, means coronavirus cross-immunity notably distinct strains possibility. could bode well effectiveness variants. Yeah, case covid got vaccinating mild.

Not covids problem. I'm 32 old man who's great shape ALSO got lucky. According news media, worst variant ever yet really, is, maybe. Why? long anyway, prioritize longevity? would beneficial society long run. sharing learn didn’t want blamed. South Africa struggling isn’t helpful.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Yep. Better look behavior words. Top officials know *something* bad variant, even preliminary data. mitigation reduction rather prevention.

Source? doubt impact putting mask 30 seconds go table, going maskless next 2 hours.   rapacity scientific journal industry makes corporate capitalism look like kids stuff. shit not, pubs cannot access online institution pay subscription. mean, copies obviously, go actual journal paywalled out. thanks. guys fun though.   frustrating watch businesses spend much time money sanitizing surfaces instead worrying air must mad dash get boosters get get done crunched numbers directly NICD. Gaeteng one highest vaccinated provinces South Africa. also new admissions outbreak happening. Roughly 38% Gaeteng meets South Africa's definition ""vaccinated"" received single dose vaccine. 

Recrunching numbers gives 5.5 x less likely hospitalized, much better original calculation. 

The important date Gaeteng:
38 % "" vaccinated"".
31.5% ""fully vaccinated"" (1 dose J&amp;J 2 mRNA).
22.5% total population Gaeteng fully vaxxed 2 mRNA.

The critical data percentage 10% unvaxxed hospital 22.5% 2mRNA recipients. Deny sorts medical treatment unvaxxed. It’s like miss them. 12-17 year olds? They’re ones school. need booster Moderna already said multiple times adjust vaccine variant market like 6 months less. absolutely interest say current vaccines might work. I'm sick Bancel culture *Reasonable* degree confidence.
*Fairly* good protection.

That's awful lot hedging. Let's hope they're simply underpromising overdeliver. Rich countries hoarding vaccines -- global vaccination campaign quite extensive. problem getting vaccines areas they're needed, also convincing local populations use them. issue SA. Plenty vaccines donated, population trust government shit help change that. Same, also Monica Ghandi There's actually vaccination tourism starting Netherlands. People taking kids Austria get vaccine.

Sad think it.  Yes. existing vaccines use spike protein sequence.

The problem Omicron spike several mutations region neutralizing antibodies bind. existing antibodies (either induced vaccines previous infection) would bind poorly all. 

However, antibodies targeting neighboring parts spike, viral proteins would still bind, efficacy drop zero. Moreover, compensate *amount* antibodies - higher titers substitute lower coverage. boosters come in.  think need campaign encourage unvaccinated folks _not_ go hospital. Obviously campaign politicians public health embrace. Regardless you’re right wrong, original point still stands. It’s everywhere. huge transfer hub international passengers. it’s bad thinking, we’re screwed. pandemic also teaching us need prioritize getting HIV-positive individuals bit vaccines pandemics. 

Beta, potentially Omicron, likely tailored evade vaccine prior infection induced immunity within immunocompromised individual. 10 million individuals southern Africa, 7 million reside South Africa alone.

You couldn’t find many severely immunocompromised individuals entire Western Hemisphere Europe combined.

Next time world better job getting shots arms immunocompromised individuals, vaccine hesitancy likely still problem, time around South Africa. going irrelevant vaccines make difference now. 20% South Africa HIV positive. poor immune system can, cases, make vaccines less effective. happens nessecarily indicative happens elsewhere.  CDC says get boosters. said won’t even protect this. cancel booster tomorrow not. Frustrating fear tactics, Misleading headlines get. cool   worth keeping mind Moderna Pfizer CEOs impartial scientists, business agenda. 

Looks like two companies choose different business strategies, betting new vaccine vs. doubling existing one. Stock price going = much higher compensation big wigs inside. It’s contracts. think we’re already capacity adults get vaccinated voluntarily. Need mandate vaccines. triple vaccinated people symptomatic delta too. happen variant. say there’s concerns tho omicron, feels like week everybody terrified delta even though remains 99+% circulating virus, people acting like delta good ol’ friend omicron problem. comment trying highlight scale actual problem - would prefer put energy towards eradication C19 rather appeasement. ask leave plane like people inside pump thousands gallons fuel

It's also tiny together. Agreed.

Travel bans show-off ""lookie-lou seriously taking new variants!"" prevent new variant spreading around world, dubious whether even slow spread new variants practical amount.

Travel bans corny flexing view. sure downvoted. twitter thread seems like well-reasoned sourced hypothesis situation likely work way. Firstly widely believed current boosters offer protection. Second nothing special 6 months. simply picked serious antibodies waning observed. continue wear indoors common sense common courtesy employees. decide good 4 days it? Early reports seem indicate less deadly though, there's that. really understand hinting at.

Anyway, various restriction coming back. covid passes came back things couple weeks ago. Like cafes museums, IDK else. masks came back well, shops large public indoor gatherings. I'm Albany, risen balmy 22F right now. sad becoming widespread news threat poses general public opposed *always* point concern, be, nurses burning en masse affecting, gee... *nurses* families.

These issues new. issues existed long time within nursing field. They're publicized pandemic forced nation examine public health way public health utilization affects people providing services. hear *any* concern past 8-10 years I've field, problems definitely existed since then.  people life impacted death lacked control choices… hence tragic. like confusing really news. like sports reporter predicting win Super Bowl. make educated guess level confidence, sure. end day know things play out. mean believe antibody protection totally wiped out? remains unknown confidence cells remain intact regardless happens antibodies? would 100% support anyone get 2nd/3rd shot since rapidly evolving situation.

But course Delta variants still dominant around long time. I'm you. extended family met Thanksgiving &amp; family attend. hate worth risk point even though we're fully vaxxed/boosted. also still wear mask anytime public. Stay safe. month ago. lost taste/smell completely 3 days. started coming back slowly everyday. kept smelling strong candle apple cider vinegar test it. week, taste almost back taste coffee IPAs (two things love). month, finally taste notes two items safe say I'm ok now. smell also back. completely random likely get back eventually. I’m sorry happened :(

But, uhm. Well. Fuck must really problematic anybody who’s spending 100% time bars restaurants. Please, let be. CEOs ignored. Wait neutralization assay data released.

I'm pessimistic yet. boosted antibody titers much higher original vaccination titers saw. I'm keeping optimistic high titers compensate decrease affinity. back March / April 2020, anyone knew anything.

Instead underlining facts back Maeve-Binchy-territory first chance rare, magic summer evenings alfresco meals. surprised Lambrusco Tiramisu mentioned!

I annoyed newspaper story long time. Yet China consistently leading vaccine exports throughout pandemic, contrasting Brazil begged US vaccines vaccinate elderly given answer ""you getting vaccines us, suggest let people die using russian vaccines"".  Y'all need realize one posted headline posted article, simply followed Reddit's requirement alter article headlines.

It’s like ended, everything OK. Flood water. painful truth vaccinated. hope ok kill family members covid.

Even absolute peak hospitalizations deaths last winter stay home orders. seem trending themes past 24 hours several experts including Gottlieb, Bedford, Hotez.

(1) modifications spike proteins concerning boosted individuals enough virus neutralizing anti-bodies protect omicron (this case previous variants similar mutations), (2) Disease severity likely less previous strains severe, (3) importantly, appears SA oversampled new variant may transmissible first thought. Hopefully, would mean would hard time outcompeting Delta. You’ve pasted several threads apparently linear time alien concept you. 

Who exactly time machine go develop variant specific vaccines variants sequenced?

Pfizer Moderna issued statements saying working this. need personally telephone you? mean catch disease vaccinated mean even catch disease vaxxed severe? I'm double vaxxed still caught it. know varient was. want know is, vaxxed boostered, still mean catch disease chances getting severely ill vaxxed?

I'll wait info/data. take step like that, I'd like see experts Israel advise. They've helpful far. data available yet experts likely predict fewer breakthrough cases (hospitalizations/deaths) get booster omicron. Still, one get booster prevent getting delta anyways. statement fact vaccines safe ans effective true time. yep. Though even 50% reduction dose, Moderna still mRNA Pfizer. That's likely Moderna reduced dose booster Pfizer didn't. best answer would 98% survival average might hold true you, certainly may case someone medical issues comorbidities. unvaccinated, relatively young healthy individual might work fine people, expose virus? Getting vaccinated show solidarity friends, neighbors, coworkers, healthcare providers...and reducing transmission reduces likelihood thing mutating something worse 98% survival rate average. mention protecting lingering symptoms COVID. Lol. gotten first shot yet they're never going ok. Thanks info developed world, sure. Rat lickers deserve rights. Hmmm weird majority population hasn’t vaccinated Wow that's good.   That's longer lockdowns. journals arbiters success academia, think wield awful lot power gets climb ladder?

That's exactly case traditionally. That's concerted effort break monopoly via websites like pubmed medrxiv. Historically, traditional journals gatekeepers science. get published, might well exist. Sure, people would self publish putting papers website ftp server. gets basically exposure. websites allow researchers bypass gatekeepers self publish. journals still lot power. Since self publish paper nearly much pull one published established journal. problem gatekeepers may suppress progress since support status quo. many landmark papers repeatedly rejected authors found one journal would publish it.  That's either said.

Vaccines waning able prevent infection, mean get severely ill.

The vaccines still work, stop infections idea considered discarded. origin point certainly much closer (in terms rate travel) Johannesburg European  correct sequence thoughts vaccinated person learning news. Thanks leaving crucia part unsaid would say Yeah - could worse, true, hospital systems everywhere going swamped soon. That's scary everyone.

That said, idea source still really early reliable data, interesting. think people thinking bit selfishly. I’m vaxxed therefore know I’m likely ok catch beast. hand restrictions would annoying tell mates family get ass vaccinated. person top chain never said relatively good news. said “really really good news.”  already talk variant originating HIV positive patient. first identified Also I’d assume get boosted likely engage lower risk behaviors general, thus, less likely become infected That's right, hit em hurts: wallet. mixed news. confusing news. boosted good shape, sounds like banking natural immunity anti-vaxxers even greater danger. *The Covid vaccines* Yeah, anything, Omicron variant continue going past months: Covid largely pandemic unvaccinated. unfortunate, especially poorer countries. you’ve done job gotten vaccinated, likely fine. Yeah holding thought line thinking that's boosted today. Delta gone anywhere yet. Infection yes severe disease no. Good news considering might've SOL think means. get angry paying medications, dental, various things covered. parking ticket bill. stop infection, stop severe illness.

This presented either way binary form (stop versus stop) leads misinformation. Vaccines reduce infections reduce risk severe illness. !!! surprised confused. always thought pharmaceuticals intelectual propierty drugs. mostly useless tablets. seems making active principle much difficult making tablets. chemical companies make active principles flush cash? Also, kind misalocation capital? Supply chains making chemicals require lots money, earn lot money order invest produce lot?

Also, particular drug produced? May know part making drug difficult part? Thank you¡!!!! real roller coaster headline grabbing today. I've heard everything benign death within 48 hours. Hopefully get solid reporting soon. considered started there, region many countries seeing recent spike cases? man may cancer immunologists, speaking companies interest mind. scientist waits data making claims. likely skipped Xi, unless fallen clickbait bullshit. Look I'm another bad winter CEO tempered production expectations timing looks like 2 months. EU, another 3 months approval .. ideal timeframe normal life question, opportunity get vaccinated, already know prior infection plus vaccination works better prior infection alone?

It's question although opportunity get vaccinated, becomes matter getting vaccinated *before* they're exposed COVID **and** *whether choose take vaccine.* 

I'm sure geographical location is, US example, almost **HALF** country **refuses** take vaccine political reasons, religious reasons, maybe even medical reasons. Whatever reason is, **they refuse take it.** 

Those choose opt vaccine obviously many times greater risk getting COVID, already it. get gotten vaccine prevent getting COVID. 

That's question stems from. Prior infection immunity vs Vaccination immunity. extremely relevant comparison think it. Unfortunately COVID. Severity always correlate negatively transmissibility, especially particular virus   Netherlands’ RIVM health institute disclosed patient samples dating Nov. 19 23 found contain variant. last Wednesday, Nov. 24, South African authorities reported existence highly mutated virus World Health indicates omicron bigger head start Netherlands previously believed.

From [Netherland's' RIVM health RIVMNational Institute Public Health Environment found Omicron variant test samples taken Netherlands earlier November. samples taken GGD test lanes 19 23 November 2021. Saltro, lab analysed tests, submitted samples requested special PCR test, samples showed abnormality spike protein. raised concern Omicron variant coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 might involved. samples sent RIVM National Institute Public Health Environment confirmation. 29 November, two samples confirmed Omicron variant. yet clear whether people also visited southern Africa. RIVM alerted Municipal Public Health Services (GGDs) regions samples taken. GGD notify people involved start source contact tracing.  *surprised pikachu face  got covered maam. Oh, I'd bet wife got it!!!(the vaccine). Sorry, said low sequencing. Around 1000 140 000 cases week right now. won’t! day, spokesperson Sheba confirmed two doctors suspected contracted variant indeed infected Omicron. cardiologists. spokesperson said experiencing “very light symptoms.”

We already know Delta spread within vaccinated populations isn’t something new surprising. left reassuring part “very light symptoms” - good news considering physicians 50s 70s. think means twice likely get sick. twice sick. makes sense. whole pandemic temperature screened once...and one boarding flight. Exactly incredibly stupid. Obviously **it's relative**.

Days ago people wondering vaccine would *at all* effective. preliminary data suggesting *could very* effective.

If thought lost entire life savings found half it, could *relatively good news*. last wave, isn’t India good spot vaccines inoculated populace? 

In Texas, finished large 3rd wave mimicked India: huge surge weeks dramatic fall stabilized numbers. funny listen ""correct"" authority. linking doctor experience variant, inline view, must quack. know, I'm usually 95% effective job, weeks effectiveness drops 75%, I'd definitely say ""struggling"". relative.  another way destroy Public Schools keep dummies dumb, DeSantis craves!!! 3 doses pfizer, next cycle dose much shorter ever entire life. Ha! 

You think global anti vax people going jump onboard late date greater good? Believe wish. got vaccines soon eligible kid, well getting boosters needed. Unfortunately good portion humans globally zero intention this. likely think change? live US, I’m optimistic.  none mild, any, symptoms.

That means works. eyes!  another 1st Responder die Covid area......Covid killing half Police across Country. Saddest(to most) part is, they'd alive gotten vaccinated. realize many Police IQ high, common sense come play point. Don’t sign government property. effective serious illness.

The vaccine keeps hospital/ICU compared non vaccinated people. He's cancer immunologist speaking experience. He's entrepreneur businessman.  Yeah, know less, issues even first Moderna shot. Full body rashes, joint pain weeks, crazy period bleeding went month, racing heart, tinnitus, etc. 

My doctor sure whether even get second dose, went ahead another bad round symptoms, two months subside.

He's recommended switch Pfizer since Moderna seem get along, curious experiences people done this. appreciate shared anecdote. Here's hoping Pfizer booster better system.  vaccine 75% effective ""struggling"" virus? Using word struggle would think would like 50% effective.  really need get messaging down. part, I’ll still continue business usual. I’ve read, don’t see cause alarm frankly. I’m thing I’m weighing get booster next month sit tight wait booster specifically omicron. don’t think want situation get booster every six months get boosters variants whenever pop up. virus spreads less first couple months vaccinated. effect comes quickly. source? 12ft.io Counterpoint: gastric issue last year went GP handed PPIs sent home. Pain reduce, went back said he'd refer gastroenterologist gastroscopy. 

Since already prescribed standard PPI, gastro triaged said urgent enough. given wait time 10 months. 

I've lived States good insurance, I've seen specialists two weeks People freaking back March frickin 2020, I'd say vaccine still job pretty good news. agree - people can’t take vaccine medical reasons (I friend battling cancer example) vast majority anti vaxxers aren’t group. rest society subsidizing bad decisions? threat healthcare systems overwhelmed big say, could greatly relaxing licensure requirements training people en masse around clock past two years, paying whatever takes incentivize show up--or even drafting emergency medical corps necessary. may sound impractical, indefinite, rolling lockdowns, already cost trillions crippled global supply chains, even impractical.

Of course, far clear threat hospitals overwhelmed really great justify either approach. Early pandemic, experts claimed Sweden's approach would lead ICU load ""at least 40-fold greater pre-pandemic capacity."" [Here, see page Yet, approach hardly unmitigated success, Sweden's ICUs never overwhelmed all, much less 40-fold. mistaken projection far isolated example. places failed follow expert guidelines, ranging Florida Belarus, seen hospital resources strained times, threatened collapse never arrived. Thus, data seem show danger healthcare systems overwhelmed substantially overstated. 314 mutations mean  Pfizer's smaller dose definitely switch worried side effects, though huge random factor. Even J&amp;J booster (completely different set side effects, necessarily lower) many *times* better nothing. Dang, highly humorous. attitude like won't. understand, many mutations able bind cells infect them. upper limit things. know it. giving source good enough days?

So it’s really protecting unvaxxed, people general since vaccine won’t protect new variant incredibly debilitating side effects

Heeeyy, Einstein 🙃 I’m generally travel bans they’re generally ineffective, even theoretically. However, three conditions which, apply, might make make sense:

1.	No community transmission. community transmission exponential growth influx immigration linear, it’s obvious actual spread within borders dominated community transmission. 
2.	Minimal leakage implementation. intervention part governed effectively implemented. Borders notoriously leaky physical legal reasons. They’ve made headway mandatory quarantine arrivals, it’s panacea. 
3.	Most importantly, needs recognized you’re buying time. You’re going reducing impact people healthcare system implementing travel bans. you’re going push back spike weeks. use time things like prepare new vaccine, plan medical capacity expansion, otherwise prep economy government responses, it’s time well used. not, paid heavy price buy weeks nothing it. boosters required, hesitancy increase uptake decrease, think.

Ah, good comment, it’s layered risk mitigation. Here’s analogy: could reduce risk auto accidents near zero imposing universal 40 mph speed limit, requiring fire suits mandatory full face shield helmets.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Knowing everyone flight fully vaccinated makes huge difference. US airlines see way forward baffling.

You better believe I'll pay right connecting flight abroad hubs another Canadian airport comfort knowing everyone long leg vaccinated. Better safe sorry. need put pcr testing requirements quarantine upon landing retesting 3 days later open travel still unknown next weeks countries. flu shot always takes day. Moderna doses took 1-2 days. Also 7 months shots starting wane efficacy.  Getting shot 4 days travel also going much anyway takes build immune response. 

So booster margins given constraints. worry though getting soon. doctor implied boosters available age group infection effectively acted booster shot us (I got sick nearly week did). Depending age, perspective, don’t need trip get booster. don’t think would hurt, wouldn’t lose sleep it. Definitely ask doctor. awfully focused snarky tone reply original snarky comment. want know becomes dominant strain? 

The question US even looking? ahh dream live carrier virus vaccines till use *RNA (notnsure based) payload. live virus deliver rather nanolipid bubble. Whether virus given new designation name mostly arbitrary, depends similar behavior effects predecessors.

We know yet Omicron behaves. send source says that:

1) Pfizer intelectual propierty API.

2) Pfizer produce API.

My understanding statements completely false. Data without context useless. bump hospitalizations come unvaccinated. we've seen far, vaccines holding severe disease. play hand dealt, case drew meantime, Moderna CEO Says vaccines likely ineffective -- who's right? course vast majority cases unvaccinated, SA low vaccination rate  sure is, difference weigh it, get whiney information presented media CEOs. Outcompeted? pills? Unfortunately false sense security. Creating fake covid extremely easy interested getting vaccinated plenty time  think maybe term API defined, Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient; chemical building block case limiting Pfizer. API limiting function generic (Not make Pfizer probably profit low) new component. clearly never set foot anywhere state outside sticks, go off. news, conjecture. really know effective vaccines Omnicron. far we're seeing anything alarming. Let's wait data panicking.  Vaccination greatly reduces probability individual contracting covid though, reduces number days individual contagious. better getting COVID, damn.

you actually know this, though even businesses, seriously doubt money coming feds people whose jobs put ice. Operation Warped Brain Speed study showing reduction found flawed anyway. Really, I'm going wait data says, far data SA showing vaccines still effective. asked clarify result cherry-picked? 
 
The Beijing one controlled. It’s masks addition sorts measures.  
 
The hair salon, Thailand, navy ship anecdote (case studies), although give credit going 100% effective would conclusion hair salon anecdote alone. 
 
So, study using back 70% claim? 
 
I’ve seen sort randomized controlled study showed efficacy anywhere near level.  
 
That site doesn’t even claim 70%. little misleading, I’ll admit, saying “how effective Covid? Well, one time, navy ship, mask wearing associated 70% reduction…” sort sounds like, maybe intentionally, imply 70% accuracy, don’t think scientist would suggest proof that. 
 
Meanwhile, actual large scale randomized studies show much modest effect. 
 
If know actual studies: group A, masks. Group B, masks, shows kind efficacy, I’ll happily change view, would broader vigorous studies I’m aware of. actual data this? anecdote medical workers? Mexico city lost 1% population, CFR would larger Big shout provincial government’s criminally negligent handling second third waves main contributor us hitting milestone part info baseless meaningless? confirmed 32 mutations spike protein. can't derive info feedback, even worse, misunderstand irrationally react they're saying, that's fault comprehension skills, information provided. know anything else then. seems normal might redneck rest us. previous variants similar mutations. Yes, Omicron one mutation Alpha, one Beta, one Gamma, one Delta. also 27 additional spike mutations, including 11 never seen (much less named variant).

Just mutated mean antibodies vaccine work it. understanding antibodies still recognize attack mutated spike protein ""stick"" well mutation takes job. (Source: Science Vs. podcast vaccine, can't remember one.)

So statement made based idea boostered individuals make fuckton antibodies, there's good chance enough trick. Dems lockdown get annihilated midterms, don’t think they’re ever gonna seriously consider it. So..... able get EVERYONE ELSE vaccinated?

But guess they’re able direct hatred toward people they’re antivax  Well everyone struggling Moderna there’s that. agree media report company heads saying. problem message that’s amplified.

maybe sending unvaccinated soldiers battle foreign lands actually tactics  trouble getting appointment, try calling local places 1/2 hour injections stop day.

I’m overthinking going take it.  statements necessarily conflicting. Moderna's CEO said vaccines likely materially less effective omicron variants. 

BioNTech's CEO said vaccines likely protect severe disease.If protection symptomatic illness goes (say) 85% 75% protection moderate severe illness goes 95% 90%, statements true. might two CEOs room together would agree other.

While news outlets could better job contextualizing facts, readers also better job synthesizing available information multiple sources. cases stabilising though. 1% growth compared last week. since hospitalization always behind weekish something. don’t see contradiction everyone else seeing. “The vaccines struggle Omicron” “vaccinated people strong protection severe disease Omicron” mutually exclusive statements. Yes people working 90%+ efficacy mass produced tested vaccine past year educated guess. Lots stories today suggesting Omicron NBD. Juxtaposed Moderna saying may need revamp vaccine. wonder people can’t take anymore. especially despise arguments need lockdown protect elderly. nearly two years. Many elderly people died old age isolation alone last two years. step-grandfather one them. Beyond that, really need registered nurses? need people perform every possible duty nurse? need (for example) someone provide breathing treatment? latter could trained withing short period.  circumcision prevent hiv??? done planet.

Like ""fuck antivaxxers"", also fucking lot people control situation. They've already dropped way lower Delta.

It's dropped low infection all, symptomatic serious been?

Right here, trying civilized conversations like adult. Maybe give try. feel this. care want *tasks* well. Every patient collection parts arrange. “That’s point.”

* anti vaxxers US lol. 

It would really put republicans weird spot. 

“People need healthcare!!” 

“Cool, better insurance cheaper shit like countries?” 

“Nah, that’s communism, die instead”. also reduce fever tylenol advil, ""cheat"" system suspect sick.

Also experience temperature forehead generally depends cold outside. Like, body temperature 97 degrees that's usually reading get basically winter here. Less genital mutilation good. Hopefully translates females well.   heard someone else say safe vaccinate notice fever symptoms anyway. might reschedule. think mainly infecting patients vulnerable location. Getting shot infected life threatening. Vaccinated individuals significantly less likely contract virus. those, vast majority significantly less likely develop case severe symptoms. severe symptoms, majority require hospitalization...

Meanwhile unvaccinated almost guaranteed get infected come contact point quickly easily Delta/Omicron spreads... coin toss whether end asymptomatic ICU, many falling two outcomes.

Just vaccinated individuals spread it, mean will, mean spread rate someone unvaccinated. vaccines exactly they're meant - Slow spread improve outcomes get infected anyway.  Apparently found Omicron infected person link (yet) travel SA, found last week. quite concerning Yes, sick showing symptoms logic, wear masks avoid social gatherings, right? 

But might say: well, people carry transmit without symptoms. 

And that's true colds, viruses flu too. what's answer then? wear face masks forever prevent spread known infections? Obviously not. Face masks prevent wearer spreading shit everywhere, partially work, problem end people developing immunity infections, they're delaying/avoiding inevitable. 

Covid going go away, like seasonal flus colds always mutate make return. really, face masks redundant. vaccine prevent transmission either, want introduce even booster jabs, supposed 2 jabs good. people told anyway. really going here? Capitalism disregard human life. exactly preparing? suggestions go back lockdowns TP hoarding getting boosters? Selfishly, huge bummer! Thanks heads up. Mandatory masks bars clubs currently, even w proof vax? counting? like Delta dominant strain. Unless going back full lockdown point? desperately need information reporting raw data unhelpful. seem like many people panic. places precautionary, people suggesting conspiratorial ideas governments must know much worse secretly get downvoted, seems like unpopular idea. Seems best, people worried might wear mask Oregon maybe bars close early. panicked virus itself. first impressions Omicron may able avoid current vaccines, UK doubling them, response rise Omicron Cases? could vaccines' effectiveness drops 75%

They've already dropped way lower Delta. been? really varies person person. people know better 3rd know someone got hit hard 3rd. Personally miserable 2nd Moderna third symptoms except arm pain even anywhere near bad.  American loves ZA, reeeeally tickles know braai’s Netherlands well!

I know what's worse: fourth wave one little sentence. mean I’d rather people take seriously passive prepare anything, personally. though   I'm following science appear CDC snipping People would lose fucking minds. 

Here Pennsylvania decent number people since day 1 caused problems.  Sucks. 

Curious would happen though. 5 shots? basically unvaccinated many. Personally 16 shots Pfizer getting 14th moderna afternoon. pandemic un undervccinated all. They're Chinese vaccines Like Spanish flu. This. confident product, hold making statements know data. Science funny way humbling people. Definitely prefer wearing mask wildfire season. Waking sore, dry throat hangover great. Putin put there? nato need them!?

/s yes, particular ingredient short supply API. PF-07321332. anyone free make compound. fact Pfizer would love want buy lots it. problem supply chains literally exist (or didn't, prior now). made now. 

there artificial manipulation. Pfizer would make billions supplies billions would sell. guess read somewhere counting single doses among remaining 13%. Yeah guy looks real trustworthy Oof hoping could offline semester college :/ though? companies say current vaccines dont work, boosters? Arent updating vaccine three months? thanks shove ass. keeps face recognition cameras confused. doubt boosters edge. know lot 3x vaccinated people, got covid. usually without symptoms (apart loss smell taste). So, vaccine seems prevent getting sick well, couple months little protect catching virus spread it.   Let’s stick bunch people poorly ventilated room change rules constitutes “close contact” reporting purposes it’s convenient, science, wonder outbreaks. Someone clearly read article lol.  South Africa dominant strain while. mutation that. unwell risk developing severe COVID-19 disease dying, including people 60 years age older comorbidities (e.g. heart disease, cancer diabetes), advised postpone travel. symptomatic infection thing plain old infection? They’re really concern don’t think. Outside rare cases, it’s adults real risk. Also curious, country EU possible get boosters moment 60, probably keep way beginning next year least. look medicine works. Also MedCram talked end latest video unvaccinated family's response: ""I knew would find way keep milking this! "" 

Anyways, people vaccinated now, going be. over, whoever survived without vaccine benefitted others part, going say "" see! told you! "" Even vaccinated, still infected COVID-19 pass others. identified contact someone COVID-19 required self-isolate, help protect others following guidance stay safe help prevent spread.

17 Nov publications Thanks. feels bit premature, really speculation point is, vaxxed breathe big sigh relief. Like said, encountering virus daily basis increases risk, vaxxed not. Antibodies created process called somatic hyper mutation, hundreds thousands different antibodies assembled test binding antigen. 

The antigen could spike protein, also possible antibody binds “peaks valleys virus particle”.

In words antibodies bind spike protein viral envelope beneath it.

But random, every persons antibody bind slightly different onto spike protein. It’s unlikely mutations producing exact antibody. 

The lock key metaphor explanation antibodies bind specific specific antigen, explain complexities antibody binding, specific parts bound. medical school Hungary named Semmelweis. restrictions based high proportion sequenced positive cases omicron variant South Africa compared rest world. Ohhh, disclosure agreement?

Thank lot chatter!!!! [The race understand 'immune take risk? take risks everything, always calculation risk/benefit. think risk reduction barring unvaccinated flying worth reduced transmission vaccinated still spread it. comes point risk reduction become unjustified.

Where's proof I'm wrong? want 4.5yr old vaccinated! sitting Canada wondering means Pfizer Moderna combination got Two doses 5 months likely. Yep. 50% better flu shot still.

For benefit others:

I've seen mentions flu vaccines low 30% effective.

That still considered significant, especially prevents death lessens symptoms.

I got annual flu shot last week. Extremely early, looks like it’s unvaccinated much vaccinated population. 

If true, think vaccine mandates ne necessary completely overwhelm healthcare systems. I’m mistaken, mutated B.1.1. media spam technically wrong, know it. milk constantly data comes in. sound like transformer, decepticon exact? kkkk  first glance thought photo undone fly doctor woman doctor’s cock  expected booster may required while. think current guidance 6 months. Hmm bring good point though! Studies using antibody titers standard determine vaccine efficacy, seem taper around 6 months last course, immune system also composed defense mechanisms (nk cells, b cells, cells, complement systems) im curious studies go see levels change time (especially one ends getting infected completing initial course vaccine regimen) I've lost relationships siblings law this. can't visit wont vaccinate even mask. agree I'm angry them, want die. worry them. One new baby. One pregnant. worry much them. Already outcompeting Delta South Africa though. thing contagious unreal.

It's estimated 500% contagious delta, hospitalisations South Africa tripling. asking outcompete it? That's understanding too. vaccinated two doses need booster due remain vaccinated. likely also mean booster last year again. still quite impressive works well. think it’s mostly carrot stick

There’s touch prevention well tbh airplane pretty safe pre vaccine air circulation, everyone masked Maybe could spend time Hermann Cain awards sub get dose reality. Delta gives zero fucks, Omicron probably either.  

You vaccination rest comment clearly displays. 

Getting vaccinated living fear. Unlike many unvaxxed people younger me, I'm alive kicking, FREE dumbass much want. 

I'll take day deep throating vent tube. you. Thanks much thoughts this! Going likelihood (or one countries near sequencing) source would bit worrying different country detected them. good news already fully vaccinated. really bad news not. article defines vaccinated booster. 

If true see people previously unvaccinated start getting vaccinated including previously relying natural immunity. 

I hoping variant would transmissible mild providing blanket immunization across globe. 

Does anyone know source reliable typically is? good see almost scientists coming saying good things. thought TP gonna disappear again. Yea, masks worked better them. Jesus Christ, obviously vaccines work better. Hence said escape immunity Minor correction, 16s gotten shots within past 6 months. 16 17 year olds covered initial EUA Pfizer (not Moderna) would eligible soon met whatever criteria state laid prioritization. haha answer. ha, I'm exactly (I live Portugal). least chose go double shot pfizer instead J&amp;J one shot (if man 50 could choose here). Hopefully that's given sweet Cells! Oh yea - think less half population gets flu shots annually

From I've heard, people need get 2 shots year, plus shots stronger side effects vs. flu shot...

It's gonna fun heard otherwise healthy, fully vaccinated individuals intubated covid surprising first thing drew people's attention. came nowhere. There's real lineage - long black box previous known strain tiny fraction mutations. 

The leading belief (especially given origins region) festered long time (6-12 months) immune compromised person (likely HIV/AIDS). immune system never able clear infection, virus able continuously mutate evade weak immune system. explains lack lineage - also based Delta; Delta existed time first infection.

The belief spent time zoonotic reservoir (having gone bat human new zoonotic reservoir human). said, one would *typically* (but always) expect reduction transmissibility (even increase immune escape) round trip virus optimized transmission new target host. young healthy, going hurt wait another 2 weeks full 6 mos get booster like everyone else is. 

Don't know exactly US South southern states experiencing lowest case numbers COVID prevalence since pandemic began. Delta wave summer. flew US South Africa hours ago pretty sure plane quite positive people considering dozens coughing nonstop throughout flight. earliest appointments booster within hour drive day Christmas lol. get there's supply issue point, get vaccine basically walk grocery store.   money Florida.

New York / California likely however. always people can't get vaccinated, always children young get vaccinated. people have, continue have, responsibility take extra steps keep safe rest population. new Covid, change fact vast majority people continue able live lives protection vaccines provide. Can't get booster appointment till next Thursday earliest (Boston suburbs). sure whether good sign bad one.  Educated informed people harder deceive control. That's fascinating terrifying.  marvel went ""scary new virus pandemic"" ""over half *world* vaccinated it"" less two years.

Absolutely bonkers. unparalleled miracle science. people reached wait time eligibility? protected triple boosted? [UV air purifiers junk science. HEPA filters actually UV air purifiers also HEPA filters actual filtering work, UV takes long kill viruses UV air purifier actually anything useful designs and, worse, produce ozone actively harmful. boogie man variant bad idea. Two birds one stone. What's neat usually shakes out. virus knocks host completely makes unable spread quickly. clarify, dont think go away. lot less people would dying allowed rest world deserve Agreed, need lot information here. Hopefully come soon, though going time kind population data. Thanks, familiar term! Yes, like flu would get one every time new one needed, without would likely die caught COVID. r value really 7.8, would bad-- [more contagious Delta 

But question whether enough data Omicron generate precise R value. Even Delta, usually express r value range 5-8. 

We make projections Omicron based genetic structure, clinical data still extremely preliminary. I'm neither legal military expert pentagon contradict governor policy president nationalize Guard first? head Oklahoma National Guard seemed indicate waiting Title 10 orders. Fuck em hope vacate hospital beds faster sooner. Preferably basement. Got booster already relish idea getting another one. must.  imagine will, however, cause people wait booster, could real problem US. Counter-proof carried Adolfo Lutz Institute confirms really new Omicron variant.



The two confirmed cases 41-year-old man 37-year-old woman.

Both vaccinated. OHH bad. Yeah I'm hoping gets approved fast Mobilize run vaccination site lol please do...I dont need upvotes one point, Disneyworld held title ""Happiest Place Earth"" ""Most Measles-y place Earth"" time.  vaccines health. vaccine protecting people. (If risk group). first time history vaccine like forced people.

In Netherlands covid vaccine first vaccine history government government advices take protect people. That's massive difference previous vaccines. vaccine efficacy similar, I'm chillin.

Seems similar who've three shots time enough third protection pick up. Comparatively people world fit criteria yet.

In meantime, five months second dose, I'm sitting Canada federal government says third dose boosters perfectly allowable provincial government let get one. day, guess... possible get booster shot without 6 month window good efficacy? vaccine protection measured? 90% protection compared unvaccinated, meaning 90% 2.4x increased risk??  Oh wow, next week? That’s fantastic. banned essential travel, could significantly slow spread new variants. I'd like see breakdown intercontinental travel, eg business? see family?  tourism (no family ties destination)? unclear first 3 minutes watched. Taken context taking mean overall efficacy. Lol. Thank you. Agree, considering entering initial delta wave unvaccinated undervaccinated midwest northeast. Michigan already knees, that's without omicron.

The immunocompromised increasingly difficult path.

Moreover, spread much faster triple-vaxxed immunity, takes least five months get. So, M, also, continued evolution 7-billion-host scale. next? evolutionary trajectory already completely belied reassurances virologists back beginning ""stable"" coronaviruses. bit reading recombinatorial ability zoonotic coronaviruses quickly showed reassurances false case. ""realistic possibility"" successful immune evasion, recombination different virulence factors, getting higher higher.

While bad could be--yet--this grim development. top comment. necessarily. Getting first two short order never going provide long-term protection, third dose spaced least 6 months almost certainly provide better long term protection. reasoning behind observed moving spacing 8+ weeks proved effective. label wasn’t approved yet FDA time, doctors recommending patients. simply full dose Moderna. Probably takes longer make deal like that. I'm sure flights go directly Canada Africa. pretty natural language evolution. tend invent words cover multiple-words needed create meaning. Car instead ""box wheels engine"" etc. case, either change definition (what doing) need invent new word, society trying describe large percentage population ""initially vaccinated get boosters"" Jump joy still guess Sounds great. zero, mean ZERO sympathy unvaccinated point

There chronically ill people cannot get vaccinated health reasons. 

Also, children 5 eligible vaccines yet. bad news. vaccinated individual, everyone vaccinated end this. still infects people vaccinated apparently, still shed virus. Allegedly, lot symptoms experience make illness less toll body. stick around believe big brains world. Good guy Delta!  data holds true (considering probably pretty small sample point)

This main question: world possibly sample remotely statistically trustworthy? found last week.

I hope right I've got feeling way early draw conclusions.  There's literally point travel restrictions. spread already late bother. Get vaccinated. Yup, long treatment monoclonal antibodies convalescent plasma, wait 90 days.

Boosters need 6 months past 2nd mRNA vaccine, 2 months past J&amp;J. need 18 older.

That's it!  suppose leading immunologists epidemiologists folks dumb MBA track. booster day birthday September I’m good think required indoor malls.

It's not. City Council retail stores malls, regardless outdoor indoor.  Ok Even need another new one couple months??  We're counted among ""unvaccinated"" now. booster due February Canada boosting elderly moment. Hopefully rules change then. Why? would stop mutation binding tighter ACE2? Please take argument, I'm genuinely curious. US (south) cases raging. I’m doubled vaxxed (pfizer) won’t hit 6 month mark middle December. I’ve heard antibodies majorly wane 5 months. try get booster early (two weeks early) wait 6 months?  idea. posted trust Chise say. Hopefully info soon. Healthcare costs covid really, really tremendous. &lt;3 &lt;3 English version? Google translate tends suck. get America too. expensive hell, baffling shitty time.

It’s tossup. another article  I'm LA week everywhere go business checking vaccine cards. €100 euros lot Greece. don’t see wouldn’t that’s trend whole time I’m qualified say anything definitive. take yes though Well, autocorrect hates it, gonna stay way Nothing, actually. speaking generalities. I’m sorry experience. sincerely doubt unique Oklahoma, though. mean earlier today people wondering they’d provide protection infection (obviously overreacting fear still prominent). I’ll take 90% 89% anything lower. Obviously 100% would best. sure want to.

Are outside? might depend that. fuck babbling Never mind children 5 people immune compromised 😔 I'm seeing protests streets restrictions hospitals overflow demoralizing. Wondering terms apply people passing laws 🤔 Oh dang. like wanted get before, damn. Google Translate absolutely terrible Hebrew hope fuckin much true. Still sceptical get numbers early much prevent symptomatic infection (about 10%) omicron mutated lot mutation Beta. young, healthy person AZ basically useful Beta likely useful Omicron since hospitalization/death really concerns even without vaccine. Ah, never heard 🤦‍♂️
Hope make speedy recovery already exists. Beta evades vaccines Delta, may even lethal, can’t spread fast. got source made information? Yes, is, could imagine docs got booster ago, since they're Israel healthcare field. Maybe waned little. Anyway, article give detail symptoms; could really mild. US recipients 18 gotten shots within last 6 months, since approved August, would therefore considered fully vaxxed booster. 

They're saying previously vaccinated people become unvaccinated they're eligible booster protection waned get one. omicron, omnicron. greek letter ;) Same; father (mid 70's), myself, fiance 3 Moderns shots, Mom 3 Pfizer. whole family friends boosted here. Birds feather guess makes think there?  


I have. I've seen offer. I've personally experienced meeting white supremacists felt quiet empowered tell find border quickly possible avoid imminent harm myself. use fake name get “first shot.” can’t demand ID, you’re undocumented. reports many people get booster early. boosters (~93-95% symptomatic infection), Israel considering 'fully vaccinated' He's got great point, there's far confirmed cases Europe Southern Africa, travel ban punishing South Africa competent genomic sequencing, unlike US. Translation parts:

the data collected south africa european countries verified cases discovered new variant. emphasized preliminary data whole world waiting for, point become assumption work. according data, effectiveness vaccine (for received three doses, i.e. booster), decreases slightly: 90% protection, compared 95% protection delta strain. somewhat impressive reassuring data. effectiveness vaccine preventing serious illness, vaccinated three times, efficacy delta strain – strain dominant israel date.

but everything rosy: problems begin risk recovering tested. data show risk recovering infection twice high delta, rate infection 1.3 times rate infection delta. high infection rate: south africa, number patients said increased 15 times 15 days. although low numbers there, pace problematic alarming: israel many israelis vaccinated, arrival variant lead high difficult wave morbidity israel.

another worrying statistic discovered regarding unvaccinated: risk becoming seriously ill 2.4 times original strain coronavirus, one arrived israel nearly two years ago. ""unvaccinated"", also refers vaccinated two doses entitled boosters yet vaccinated therefore protection insufficient. Dumb question here. I'm home quarantine virus, still able get boosters go quarantine process? risk risk. simplest level, people sick reduces quality care unrelated issues seek medical attention. seen every peak, post-hospitalization outcome charted get busier. Hospitals completely overwhelmed care get worse, progression.

In addition, vaccinated people experience less severity upon infection, smaller viral load; shrinking viral loads reduce odds infecting someone else. 

Exposing highly-vaccinated group means less likely become infected anyone group ""beats odds"" infected themselves, viral load low. And, vaccinated person, *are* infected, likely less severe outcome less likely go infect someone else.

These things work together reduce spread. get beyond this, group, individually. 

Metaphor: boil water every time drink it, make everyone stop dumping poo well. reasonable assume Pfizer holds pretty well Moderna too, correlation there? Completely agree. issue ICU beds running staff exhausted. I'm trying die something treatable can't get immediate proper care family vaxxed twice thrice. It’s good news doesn’t (appear to) evade vaccines like originally predicted Better watch vaccines ADHD become AD4K military send die, vaccine overreach. people mentally ill. ""socialism"". better system question, government get money from?

They actually create money idea need taxpayer money fund initiatives antiquated representative current US economic policy, especially pandemic. US government pushing new cash economy [quantitative essentially creating new money fiat, increasing liquidity, causing inflation. pandemic specific thing, long time stimulate economy attempt maintain control it.

The idea harm working class people false. saw initial stimulus unemployment expansions many working class people actually made working. Part minimum wage far low, end result still adequate government support actually create net positive situation ""working class"". Ideally would need short periods time elaborate means? don’t think vaccinated people described socially responsible.

Getting vaccinated great action socially responsible; mean responsibility ends though. Yes surges largely fault anti-vaxxers, mean vaccinated people powerless prevent people dying. Vaccinated people cause super spreader events responsible; endangering community. especially true midst surge additional load hospitals result people able receive adequate care serious medical put short term inconveniences 2020 first half 2021, people cannot continue longer.

Really? really think people put short term INCONVENIENCES more. fucking fragile think people are? Restrictions mildly inconvenience people short periods time save many many thousands lives. also really need done surges, thus far lasted long. talking maybe two three months year absolute maximum people inconvenienced save thousands lives...not mention quality life improvements people need non-life saving surgeries like joint said this. Don’t put words mouth.

Well need actually think consequences promoting honest means. Cancer patients died pandemic able get treatment needed hospitals full. advocating lockdowns surges, inevitable consequence hospitals filling people, like cancer patients, dying enough resources available get treatment need; mention insane risk undergoing chemo immune compromised.

As small businesses, yes subsidized forced shut down. done extreme measure large corporations, less small businesses far something needs change. though, lockdowns fairly short infrequent appropriate restrictions place people actually follow them. goal lockdown prevent hospitals overwhelmed. would mean actually cost much subsidies reiterate would likely paid via fiat money, pushing inflation instead costing taxpayer sort Lockdown, majority people abide it, happen.

I cannot stress enough take away one effective tools keeping hospitals overwhelmed surges \*think\* people follow restrictions. Clearly percentage people still make positive difference. question big difference make. least try see goes instead shooting something know save lives? Sure places fucked full anti-vaxxers follow restrictions. places, like San Francisco example, actually abide restrictions extremely effective. make sense advocate using tool saves lives unknown portion population abide restrictions. see, see. imagine many raw materials indeed lots supply, right? may shortage. know, Pareto that. curious specifically bottleneck (as said, example, case vaccines lipids, although heard mostly filters, maybe wrong).

Don't think chemical companies receive least public subsidies able produce raw materials faster? put billions dollars making specific supply chain better? international public concern? mean, day without product, thousands people die. slight meaningful correction: booster *but they're eligible*. 

Grouping unvaccinated 6 months seems pretty aggressive, makes sense considering someone who's 2 shots fully vaccinated life even though protection waned 6 months. admitting posting anecdotal quote passing fact. proven othersiew must assume Yes saw calculation germany 01.12.2021 200 icu beds left germany 02.12.2021 around 200 missing 24.12.2021 13.000 missing. calculation based fact 21.11.2021 would 0 new infections. 

This calculation wide spread news somewhere basic mathematics. 

We know rate hospialisations per 1000 infections know rate ICU beds needed per hospitalisation. scared shit me. politicans scum nothing hate all!  
Wouldn’t incredibly convenient sick dealing something made go away? may done Covid, Covid may done them. better yet, mandate vaccine across board like Austria lockdown ever again. time antivaxxers stop holding rest us behind  post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Both true know anything. :) evidence evade vaccine... trying prove negative. Max Verstappen fans absolutely gutted. Yeah, edited out, unfair. edited responded. unfair.  


""Hick"" not-so-nice-way saying "" bunch uneducated fools keep shooting foot wondering continue laughing stock rest modern world.  


But, here's important bit -- WHY!! 


All problems face solutions. Good solutions. Solutions work proven work multiple contexts. Solutions collectively intentionally, systematically, reject collectively rather continue poor, uneducated, sick, hungry, without real hope stop shit-hole. JFC bribe ice cream. fuck wrong people think required indoor malls. malls Los Angeles outdoors like Grove Farmers Market. Century City Mall also outdoors. Beverly Center indoor mall.

Angelenos asked show proof full vaccination indoor areas including restaurants, bars, gyms, movie theaters, concert venues, convention centers, card rooms, play areas, museums, malls, play areas, spas, salons indoor city facilities. pay $48,000 / year insurance? sounds terrible. urgent care visit $1,500? network? I’m trying haven’t able get appointment CVS. Worth noting prices last year historically low year historically high. 

So yesterday 1800% change compared last year. whents compared normal year 300-500% higher normal. 
Which stil crazy expensive something used comparbly cheap norway. They’re going make travelers book-a-rest going try make getting booster soon eligible. 

Thank you! Exactly feel! Munich impossible get vaccination appointment next 2 months. ridiculous. doesn’t mean completely evades vaccine. good news evade vaccines. 

People two doses within six months boosted safe.

Many scientists worried virus evading vaccines, good news. Highly vaccinated countries still function. even $500 taxes month anymore. Mild symptoms, even 3 shots. That’s disappointing. Yet look governments flailed around Alpha Delta.

They certainly learn lesson third time, likely told good react immediately. want fan flame, yes, three Pfizer, friends definitely contagious catch Moderna. Ugh, got first pneumonia shot months ago due asthma. kicked ass harder Moderna shot. Congratudolences. You’re living fantasy world friend. One nothing  guess: 

Multiple manufacturers. chemical reagent used widely abundance, yes. raws refers ""base building blocks"", obviously limited supply never synthesized mass quantity before. would also guess new, efficient, synthesis steps investigated underway. people going hospital covid treated covid treatment routine. 

If disease needs treated time part 20% requires speciality care. boosters do, regular two doses not. Guess type people have?  Also, ""unvaccinated"" case means anyone without booster well fully vaccinated Moderna, Pfizer, J&amp;J, understood correctly... 90% protection 3 shots bit less ideal. Especially dangerous begin (that 10% 10% much bigger danger). course we'll see numbers pan out.  I'm struggling find booster area, frustrating news rolling out. already bit challenging, I'm seeing availability 3+ weeks. Pardon ignorance , eligible booster along flu shot. I’ve never flu shot before. I’m wary getting booster told it’s ineffective omnicron needing 4th vaccine. silly? anyone seen information this?:

If someone asymptomatic Covid mild symptoms like sneezing only, getting vaccine week still safe? Since say wait month infection get shot, don’t know it.? Hope makes sense.

I ask kids first shot due second Friday. sneezing lot it’s also windy live I’m sure. want sure they’re safe. Would rather nose poke don’t to. Ah ok, point getting booster now? new updated vacfine within three months means would get another shot three months? Lol vaccination, getting vaccines every month question.

You know best vaccine covid? Turn damn news, stop fearmongering. get booster, wait new ""update"", til live life normally, mask sure hell wont getting vaccine new one three months. F covid, keep living fear dumbasses. choose believe headline one. B cells still work, need trained new antigen. single targeted multivalent booster it. people likely booster could really, really small (though far we've shown interest reducing vaccine dosage). real, entirely arbitrary judgment ""too much"" ends sounding like five year old complaining eat vegetables EVERY DAY. FAIR ALREADY YESTERDAY. CDC tells lies circumcision drive Africa nothing preventing spread HIV, lot diverting money certain NGOs businesses (for example, WHO's special adviser circumcision holds patents medical equipment used circumcision board medical device manufacturer) US cultural imperialism. Overall areas Africa US funded circumcision programs implemented seen bigger increase HIV infection areas haven't. NGOs paid per circumcision basis led many atrocities food medical aid denied young men refuse submit circumcision, cases school boys abducted forced circumcision. causing huge resentment anti-US feeling. read here: claim circumcision useful preventing HIV terribly flawed trial run three locations Africa; group adult men circumcised compared another group not. flaws included accounting several weeks circumcised men healing unable sex, giving free health care safer sex lessons circumcised group non-circumcised group (at end trial circumcised group self-reported using condoms often), ending trial much earlier planned soon noticed number HIV cases circumcised group trend overtake number non-circumcised group. lead 'researcher' behind trial history publications promoting circumcision active circumcision fetish communities (yes, circumcision sexually exciting.)

The published results trial reported absolute reduction HIV infections circumcised group 1.3% compared non-circumcised group, absolute INCREASE approx 5% female sexual partners circumcised group compared non-circumcised group. Liars want promote circumcision convert absolute reduction relative one (which gets 52%), round 60% (just make seem impressive), tell anyone they've done this, fail mention increased incidence HIV sex partners circumcised men, mention serious flaws trial.

Even trial results could believed, show circumcision useful reduce spread HIV - effect small offset increased male female transmission. already know spend money reducing spread HIV - answer healthcare education. mentions mRNA Viral Vector vaccines. poster speaking inactivated virus vaccines like Sinopharm Sinovac. specifically target spike protein might still prompt immune response it. point aren’t much science yet need test data need evaluate hasn’t produced.  Vaccines readily available since April Germany well. OP's GF misfortune decision take first shot conincides poorly planned booster-campaign, leads sort ""congestion"" infrastructure.  Automobiles? media do? two heads two companies making pre-emptive claims. want up-to-date information situation still developing clearly subject change, read news. Come back week know more. press release, can't put science journalists complete fuck anything try say... PLEASE stop asking opinion people financial stake pandemic.  Ancient Middle East? time travel? He's corporatist, assume he'll listen airline industry. Yet another reason get corporate/rich people's money politics put American people first. people gonna start getting boosters next year. Mine due January Lmao Yep. Kink/pulled muscle feeling 2 fucking months.

Moderna. issue side arm got shot in. mask mandate

Most places? Ah, sir, entire state red MEDPROS really throw random percentages based nothing, even add disclaimer. policy ineffective. Flying require negative test, vaccine LA past week. Nothing really enforced verified. places even bother checking ID, vax QR code good go. sequemcing showed 14 61 flights SA omicron, say others?

I guess could mean viral load low sequencing (or lead delay)

..or could mean 47 Omicron. 40% COVID cases related outbreaks Colorado schools delta variant rapidly spreads among students staff.

Why can’t get school spread control? Yeah exactly

Temperature checks neither sensitive specific. think I've seen evidence result less spread places they're used. always laugh comments. Like ""yeah mind yearly shot CHANCE I'm getting one every 6 months prevent severe illness!"" Snip snap snip snap mean, afraid side effects COVID? I’ve spoken everyone work gotten COVID, including hospitalization ventilator…. many rough experiences week. don’t understand 1-2 days feeling like shit second dose sounds like worse proposition.

In UK huge study. Basically half population country. (Studies usually order thousands millions people). compared Pfizer 1st dose (mRNA), AstraZeneca 1st dose COVID infection. adverse reactions much worse infection. vaccine mandates stop cycle OOF CEO's filter saying whatever hell want.  inside?? (Canada), need wear mask sit table get piece gum equipment going use. go washroom, put mask getting table/equipment. Correct. Given limited information topic, hard compare studies. 

I hope see case studies sort completed, although hope enough people get protection start away COVID point may matter. Dude rational outcome. Complete opposite fact. got J&amp;J March, full dose Moderna July. Anyone sources/advice get third shot? go Moderna again, sure timing since I’m sort half-boosted it’s 4 months since 2nd shot. Thanks advance! different effectiveness. 60 I'd go larger moderna dose, otherwise really you. example, dad's breakthrough case congestion fatigue. fever whatsoever. Jesus, bypass vaccine. vaccine ever made impossible get virus. protects effects it. Also, everyone gets long term covid. vast majority get flu like symptoms week. 

The issues arise people vaccinated health conditions.

Get fear mongering here. also really love wearing mask. make faces public without looking like creep. 100 years ago. make suffering somehow less bad somebody worse once.

And neither you. think stoically chugged along without ever complaining desperate optimism sometimes? really think humans changed don’t understand humans become incapable hardship completely give up.

That's honestly disrespectful us we've gone past two years. ""Incapable hardship?"" Really? thought healthcare right?  misinformed. limited availability API, Pfizer manufacture. bottleneck. 

yes, forbidden making it. issue, though. even allowed, would API you, unless want outbid current price it. Neither make sense modifications spike proteins concerning boosted individuals enough virus neutralizing anti-bodies protect omicron (this case previous variants similar mutations), 

There previous variants similar mutations. Yes, Omicron one mutation Alpha, one Beta, one Gamma, one Delta. also 27 additional spike mutations, including 11 never seen (much less named appears SA oversampled new variant population may transmissible first thought

Cases Gauteng continue rise 5-fold per week. reason ""as transmissible first feared"" level immune escape, 5x number could mean either one.  Lockdown unvaccinated please long take develop targeted booster, also long take test it, trial it, manufacture it, transport clinic near you. best conditions, we'll waiting till spring that. 

I really think best move get booster. want get exposed either Delta Omicron waning vaccine immunity. much didn’t love Biden getting ahead regulatory agencies “recommendation” get starting September, would right move fda cdc align get-go simple easy understand.

They have, instead mulled three months aligned messaging. pandemic showed us general public can't handle changing situations, want constants life. lot people know believe anymore. article: Pillay said vaccinated patients treated past week generally showed milder symptoms could managed home.

It also notes rise children admitted could precautionary. 

I get cautious article mix confusing details “we don’t know anything” caveats misinformation help. boss, retired military, stated straight faced vaccine uses aborted fetal cells manufacturing, mRNA rewrites human DNA, provide 100% immunity ""like shots"" worthless.    I’m icu nurse working I’ll Covid patients, two week timeline makes sense terms disease progression severity. seeing unvaccinated patients Delta original strain, start symptoms typically turning point around day 7-8. ones decline need ICU generally come around day 8 symptom onset. that, ones ultimately succumb take ~4 weeks so. (I speak severely ill patients, statistically majority people test positive, applies I’ve seen unvaccinated individuals).

With omicron, future variant, take time collect data fatality rate, hospitalization rate, contagious is, symptoms, etc. Scientists can’t possibly know time. bothering now?Pfizer's stock price goes news vaccine bad like everyone trying confusing possible point

I swear, media gets irresponsible day country. there's much skepticism. One pumping stock, wanting Omicron-specific vaccine. Another wants pump existing product. 

(Purely conjecture part) Ok, I'm scared facts logic. I'm small they're big face ugh putting free, liberating intekllectual propierty make generics!!!!!! get vaccinated unless hunt dart like rhino

Sounds good me. vaccination drives late 19th century literally included ""papers, please"" sweeps effective enforcing *public* health recalcitrant. True, large cities tend much larger number deaths due easier transmission first-grade explanation immune response doesn’t seem reference study psudeovirus testing they’ve done. I’ve heard take 3-4 weeks develop variant pseudovirus begin using. 

So, CEO reassuring customers keep buying boosters. Pfizer go bankrupt???? Let laugh idea, hahahahahahah. really. pretty clear general concensus far, might get sick probably wont get hospitalized. Thats pretty relieving.

The verdict unvaccinated concerning part.  Different antibodies recognize different parts spike protein.

Suppose 80% antibodies could longer bind mutated spike protein (that number made example). would mean 20% still can.

So level protective antibodies depends 20%. 20% “a ton antibodies getting booster” lot 20% “the antibodies booster”, increasing total number antibodies also increases number antibodies still work well.

In addition, every time immune response something antibodies to, process called “affinity maturation” happens body learns make better antibodies bind target tightly. booster gives another chance upgrade making “stickier” antibodies, antibodies may better job handling mutated spike protein earlier antibodies did. Thank you. people DOWNVOTING ME? Pfizer pockets??? wonder vax rates compare HIV positive negative? making special point vax positive? positive folks receiving less health care less likely vaxed? age group/s majority HIV cases? many kids born infected? rates high among younger people, that's going affect covid mortality stats.  I'm waiting line booster!

Availability wide open FL (hehe). get next day wish. waited mine week Thanksgiving weekend. Worth noting guy also financial incentive sell many vaccines possible government, he’s motivated sell doom what’s really warranted. YES, COURSE Pfizer.

There would lots lots pills Pfizer limiting availability. happened vaccine. ready produce vaccine, developeped countries gobbled themselves.

It FORBIDDEN """"""""make tablet"""""""""". that, could end international Yes fact would wife.

They suggest children, case HIV suggest due prevalence HIV Africa poor hygiene. 

If trying equate personal choice men adults area HIV crisis, lack access condoms hygiene vs getting kids circumcised know smoking came conclusion morally, ethically would change HIV rates first world countries.

Moreover condom would reason period. don’t get.. wife travelled BC Ontario nobody asked see vaccination card. asked vaccinated wasn’t single verification. really think people going honest that’s banking on? Like wtf… Lmfao, honestly one thing Greeks care about, money, government definitely go way collect money. ends greek doctors bribed give fake vaccines, took money gave people real one anyways. Nice. transmissible Delta quick road endemicity. underdoor drafts. common denominator example. large buildings, like hotels. Ventilation shared rooms. There's one common system. room independent other. Nice Omicron contained. born last week. obviously going spread. sure that's ""quite concerning"". issue 24% country vaccinated. Agreed, careful looking lethality... OG something like 2% less death rate, right? could easily sample 100 people none died. good chunk may symptoms.

Yes, media riding hard, think that's reasonable given cousins quite deadly, shown least contagious. Hopefully turns lot less dangerous. share price increased publicly-traded company, people speculating.

mRNA applications - one cancer vaccines. Like rest us, company want endless covid loop.

You cynical. course go there. think conspiracy stuff. 

Yeah, it’s something worry about, it’s also holiday season cold/flu season too. People don’t want go back strict lockdowns well, it’s big priority get control can. Plus, it’s way better overreaction reaction, right? don’t think there’s stuff hidden behind scenes. It’s scientists *don’t* know yet lot stuff. mean, best viruses keep host alive cause minor illness Well...we went low cases sustained 20k+ population 17 million we're code black healthcare system since full up. So...not sure that's great news. Keep devils safe! Two three biggest western vaccine makers tried calm fears new coronavirus strain, University Oxford BioNTech predicting existing jabs would continue prevent severe disease. Markets fallen earlier Tuesday chief executive Moderna, third big vaccine maker, told Financial Times existing vaccines likely much less effective Omicron variant would take months manufacture replacement jabs scale. “There world, think, [the effectiveness] level . . . [the] Delta [variant],” Stéphane Bancel said interview Moderna’s headquarters Massachusetts. added: “I think it’s going material drop. don’t know much need wait data. scientists I’ve talked to . . . like, ‘this going good’.” Tuesday, Ugur Sahin, head BioNTech, makes leading Covid-19 vaccine Pfizer, struck upbeat tone. “We believe fully vaccinated individuals still high level protection severe disease caused Omicron,” said Sahin, citing current knowledge mechanism vaccine previous examples variants. “We anticipate booster vaccination increase protection . . . and potentially provide protection disease severity.” BioNTech Pfizer ready adapt vaccine within six weeks ship first batches within 100 days necessary, said. remarks first reported Wall Street Journal. 
Separately, Oxford, makes another coronavirus vaccine AstraZeneca, said statement “no evidence far” existing vaccines would continue provide protection Omicron, previous variants concern. “We carefully evaluate implications emergence [Omicron] for vaccine immunity,” university said. “Despite appearance new variants past year, vaccines continued provide high levels protection severe disease evidence far Omicron different.” Oxford added “necessary tools processes place rapid development updated Covid-19 vaccine necessary”. still lack reliable data vaccine efficacy Omicron pharma industry’s forecasts drew short shrift World Health Organization’s chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan. “We believe it’s premature draw conclusions efficacy vaccines Omicron,” told FT. “WHO convened expert groups scientists working experiments test neutralisation capacity stored sera recovered patients vaccinated individuals new variant. take weeks.” Swaminathan said “we need patient”, pending full “clinical effectiveness studies truly understand variant able overcome immunity generated existing vaccines”. Bancel said high number Omicron mutations spike protein, virus uses infect human cells, rapid spread variant South Africa, suggested current crop vaccines may need modified next year.

Note we're talking immune escape versus infection-generated immunity split 4 months, 10 months, 16 months ago (their huge Delta, Beta, wildtype surges).

Pretty much every expert saying Omicron *may* reduce efficacy current vaccines need time observe virus tell anything certain. Ahh mine opposite side, laying arm since shot arm sore. stretched side cramped immediately reminded old haha No, like article said numbers NICD (National Institute Communicable Diseases) Pray Omaricron Sometimes they're people care about. times clog hospitals. don’t believe last paragraph true infection.  Also LA. 

My friend owns small coffee shop/Cafe decided enforce. antivaxx. entire staff vaccinated. wish open defiance make political statement. simply impossible staff enforce this, given layout business flow cafe, without hiring someone specifically that. simply can't afford it.

Yep. impossible know point. 

Early pandemic people arguing dangerousness covid. said take stime... learn nothing dangerous virus hit daycare full 5 year olds.  learn much may affect 5 year olds lol. 

You'll know hit daycare, several schools, colleges, professional businesses, nursing homes.

This war. They're army morons point Article states hospitalized ‘almost exclusively unvaccinated’ even Thanksgiving effect yet. Please get vaxxed dumdums. ""unvaccinated"", also refers vaccinated two doses entitled boosters

If counting people 2 shots unvaccinated, stats rosy OP claiming. Delta certainly scared lot people getting vaccinated. Assuming large increase likelihood infection among unvaccinated bears out, Omicron probably same. big difference taking Moderna Pfizer booster?

Available information suggests no, big difference getting either booster So, hello measles, welcome back. 😕

I've seen conservatives point measles fact normal get, considered harmless. point Brady Bunch measles episode. Whole post implying measles vaccination waste time. Hospitalizations increased yes, thats South Africa recently low covid prevalence period... virus tends come waves, hence increase Hospitalizations, look data context.  you. WAY early this.  current wave mostly delta variant linked schools kids parents. schools currently still open stricter measures rest society. two identified omicron samples one travel history Africa one not. testing samples contact tracing, know week so. Obviously, everyone hopes variant less severe point Fauci making infections time progress scientists need time study data that's coming in.

Scientists hopefully enough data within two weeks determine omicron variant's severity transmissibility.  Same. That's worry most. Much WILLINGLY unvaccinated.  much except get many people vaccinated possible.  boosted vaccine seems protective doubt it’s 90% infection. Maybe serious illness? data holds true (considering probably pretty small sample point): really, really, really hope push unvaccinated looking get shots arms. know not, want see people die this. fair anyone. verify 24hour fitness even bother enforcing masks indoors. never really gonna good news unvaccinated folks. hospitals get backed would ration medical treatment, going people refuse get vaccinated. vaccinated get priority unvaccinated literally creates need ration medical treatment? Refusing prevent illness expecting saved doctors refuse listen childish shit I've ever heard.

Obviously talking ab people actually medical exemption. exist  Unless data antibody titers 100ug booster vs 50, please quit spreading FUD. hate guy much. feel bad people areas vaccine availability issue, people strong enough immune response vaccines.

I think anybody shedding tears antivaxxers anymore. intelectually dishonest say one name calling. Look mirror man.

Obviously article fear mongering. Look written look title. 

When know shit, obviously risk. doctor linked also calls fear mongering.

What risk even talkign about? Risk infections? Risk hospitalizations? Risk deaths? Economic risk? intertwine means purpose. First part yes, second part unrealistic experience. I'm annoyed cover covid positive coworkers shifts none staff wear masks there's select spew garbage theories calling hoax Ah. hear 10+ days. sure want booster dose. Wife wants avoid got weird shit going body first dose. got positive caught virus twice. First time tough, recovered eventually weeks, second time easy. Hardly effect lost sense smell month. 
Wife got sick recovered easily got vaccin 9 weeks later. dont think need booster dose, especially labs saying work adapted vaccin (and still don’t know variant really problem) think companies interest selling current product long possible, also know updated version ready get production fast possible, circumstances demand it.

Sorry, that's read it. still can't see another way. data suggests omi 3-5x infectious course stomped Delta, seen already S.A. Delta took 2.5 months Omi 2.5 weeks. Delta 1/3 mutations omi, yet hit vaccine efficacy dramatically (-15% serious illness reduced efficacy transmission mere 16%, practically nothing). Delta broke transmission portion vaccine, enough data expect omi overall efficacy Delta transmission. 

The best scenario I've seen creates less severe illness. However, viral loads much higher omi, previous boundaries totally, hard believe virus hijacking body efficiently would cause less harm. course, that's hope point.

I simply type before, basically meant statement - stop relying vaccines pieces paper, filter face breathe communal air. Best response spent week BC *so* nice. Masks everywhere indoors. Vaccination card checks seated restaurant.

so two weeks safe, event less one week Well, none factors suggest less infectivity compared Delta. good news vaccines true, everyone take minor grain salt. much data right now, Isreali scientists good jobs, numbers biased early epidemic. Let's wait couple weeks look neutralization data meantime. see statements affect stock prices. yesterday Moderna released statement may bring new vaccines targeting Omicron, early next year.

The information received Israel Omicron - good bad news: Bennett's declaration ""state emergency"", Israel received preliminary data tonight - South Africa Europe - new variant causing concern around world. data revealed tonight (Tuesday) ""main edition"", shortly received Israel, preliminary - indicate vaccine still effective newly discovered mutations .



The data collected South Africa European countries verifications found new variant. emphasized preliminary data whole world waiting for, point become working assumption. According data, effectiveness vaccine (for received three doses, ie also booster), decreases slightly: 90% protection, compared 95% protection Delta strain. impressive somewhat reassuring figures. effectiveness vaccine preventing serious illness, vaccinated three times, effectiveness Delta strain - strain dominant Israel far


But everything rosy: problems start risk recovering tested. data show risk recovering infection twice high Delta, rate infection 1.3 times higher Delta. rate infection high: South Africa talk 15 days number patients increased 15 times. Although numbers low, rate problematic worrying: Israel many Israelis vaccinated. 


Another worrying statistic revealed regarding unvaccinated: risk becoming seriously ill 2.4 times original strain corona, one arrived Israel nearly two years ago. ""unvaccinated"" reference also vaccinated two doses entitled booster yet vaccinated therefore protection insufficient. Despite news, data reassuring siren comes protecting vaccinated people serious illness infection Mm yes, working top academic institution information regularly vetted, peer reviewed, analyzed authenticity integrity makes us “correct” authority. 

Not attacking anyone here, you’re one name calling. doctor legit, im sure we’ll see results reproducible, promising, expanded larger cohort (ideally multicenter, double blind intervention diverse enough population), even published peer reviewed journals help clinicians decisions affecting patient lives! Argentina suffering vaccine shortage? [This talks Argentina providing booster shots population talk kind shortage. may target, I'm keeping mine. I'm expert professional (in field virology epidemiology public health) STEM field earn Masters coming Spring. would dare say anything sort. evidence back assertion policy yet. 

Check back two weeks would purely (more informed most) opinion I'll let know think. I’m starting see also. VeriFly US side ArriveCAN Canada. didn’t, moderna stock today, first trading day interview. big speculation around omicron variant, interview receive monoclonal antibodies. didnt knew that, thanks lot tip !! “travelcan”? Good Regardless SA first country Omicron. People go go vacation.

I agree travel ban SA unfair many countries also cases SA may first. 

But since tourism industry already running low capacity, travel ban really making much difference?   Same. jump line first shots, absolutely booster. knew CDC wrong limit ""high-risk"" people. Good observation. morning saw Biden going talk governors variant. 

That kind call action hasn’t seen awhile.  vaccinated person five times less likely Covid positive. 

But yeah, also add testing requirements. Many headlines skip part, like instance flights South Africa *did* require negative Covid tests regardless vaccination status. drug variant classical anti-viral drugs. chemical compound disrupts replication process infected cell.

The vaccine built upon injecting mRNA cells getting produce specific proteins.

Chemical synthesis either completely different thus different factories used. yet see grocery store enforce it. Restaurants area enforce dine in. mortons recently(as gift week ago) requirement time vax pcr test within 72h. Dining outside nights ago required show proof vax. Sitting indoors Starbucks provided proof register, sure would asked sat compare it(vax proof phone) ID. Omicron variant stirred alarm India, hit hard year devastating Covid wave fueled part another variant.

The new variant forced Indian government review decision resume scheduled international flights beginning Dec. 15. flights stopped Prime Minister Narendra Modi ordered nationwide lockdown March 2020, though resumed established air travel bubbles several nations.

While experts say likely weeks known Omicron’s transmissibility severity illness produces, countries scrambled introduce new travel restrictions halt spread.

On Monday, Mr. Modi held emergency meeting review India’s travel rules. country recently resumed issuing tourist visas reported lowest daily cases since pandemic began. India also restarted exports vaccines manufactured domestically.  Man stands gain money virus needing new vaccine says virus need new vaccine.

More 11. taken 2 PCR tests Netherlands. One came positive, hence isolate according law. get sucks her, could wait 3 days like everyone else. 

I really don’t see problems policy think countries similar measures taken. guess never agree. ideal situation weeks 2nd shot might get 95%.. waning immunity thing extra 5% could eventually drop protection something that, unboosted, considered viable vaccine - especially got comorbidity like obesity old.

So guarantee die strong word.. even today. feel like REAL Omicron data gonna revealed right Xmas travel week starts? saying it’s gonna worst revelation possible data comes back troubling, hell gonna break loose. Also patients younger may make difference :/ outcomes want tell Delta still exists. See percent Covid cases Delta become small. you? care think? One cats broke leg couple months ago took us calling 6 vet hospitals, driving 30 min waiting 4 hours car screaming pain even see her. still bed rest (apparently grows bones slowly), otherwise well now. thing know worse not, imposing quarantine travelers, banning travels stop variant spreading, already everywhere.

They impose testing traveling, would effective, would less impact economy everyone. Sorry super specific phrasing. saying fewer Omicron deaths current booster, according experts? fewer deaths, get newer booster specifically addresses Omicron. 

What trying understand booster got October basically outdated. might able get you’re looking COVID Act API: US ton jurisdictions report different rates. 7 14 day average probably best bet point take account reporting issues. cycle repeats. Damn exhausting. 6 month spacing wasn’t safety issue, needed maintain protection, given average response study groups. Dude, least knowing Moderna stock movements

Their handle spurs-r-us, short spurious. study peer-reviewed. wary media outlets cherry pick new studies fit end, confuse people. Scientific communities inherently produce diverging conclusions. healthy, keeps focus methodology. lay people co-opting dissenting pieces buck much larger professional consensus unfortunate externality. Consider first case HK arrived South Africa Nov 11, definitely spreading undetected 2 weeks. 

he able spread another quarantine guest without direct contact (and fully vaccinated) unvaccinated covid positive person pose intolerably higher risk passengers vaccinated COVID positive person?

Or another “carrots sticks” approach encourage vaccines barring unvaccinated participating normal activity? usually get seated next washroom, usually wash hands might longer 30 seconds. there's something I'm conflicted on, consider circumcision male genital mutilation. got vaccine six+ months ago haven’t boosted yet we’re going pretend still makes difference? Fascinating entire thread downvoted. Pro-vax sentiment supposed pro-science. Interestingly, already blood disorder called Von Willebrands disease makes difficult clot. extreme something like hemophilia, noticeable. noticed petechiae definitely keep eye now. I'll ask doctor too. Thank you!   still traumatizing. Yeah agreed… know, Netherlands, historically extremely close ties South Africa, Heck Afrikaans, language basically Dutch twist.  vaguely remember Trump told freedoms crowd get vaccinated booed rally. could require vaccination get commerical aircraft public transit system. would probably actually help.

Luckily Pfizer pill holds 90% giving Pfizer Covid pills help. could even Medicare maybe cover weekly tests elderly catch Covid early get pills right away. bad. reading bus. thought said: “in essence UNvaccinated people like me…”

So sorry. what's point vaccine risk others? others unvaccinated? I'm honestly sick this. understand support evidence based measures. fully vaccinated, waiting booster jab, wear mask time. 

However, think things getting mishandled governments regarding omicron variant. huge problem anti vaccine people negacionists, kind proportion measures feeds them, reinforces opinion.

It make sense restrict travel impose quarantine variant already everywhere. lazy measure imposed incompetent authorities opinion. impose testing traveling, even vaccinated, would effective also reasonable.

Honestly, I'm mad stop seeing loved ones. I'm also mad listen negacionists every day work place, stupid measures feeds conspiracy theories.

Good luck dealing omicron variant future variant 20% population refuses vaccinate! also little red dots chest? Keep eye petechiae could sign clotting issues. I'm curious neurological symptoms are. assume vaccinations also required non-residents. 

If vaccination becomes mandatory uptake close 100% much less control needed chance unvaccinated individual present extremely low.  many people. could train people health professionals instead currently are.

We accomplish drastically increasing healthcare professionals pay paying education. Hell, pay survive train too.

This give us pipeline new healthcare professionals come online two - three years.

That lines pretty well long would take build new hospitals work in. african presidents would rigid vaccinating population... want guesses. roll dice.

Yes hurts business. argue cabin air circulation safer existing federal mask mandates enough reduce transmissions.

“South Africa better vaccination rate countries continent: one-quarter population fully vaccinated”. looks like hospitalization rate currently reflects rate vaccination population. agree it’s soon say anything sure-but it’s people able spread rn ones allowed travel vaccinated people. Unvacced still pay taxes vaxed stay 'safe' even tho 60% people spreading vaccinated. Also Africa lowest rate vaccination, 6% lowest cases, Florida also lowest cases comparison California another mostly vaccinated state. think stop worrying others much let people make decisions Younger age groups vaccine hesitant. result, Gauteng, high density, industrialised city-state lower vaccinations. Rural provinces better due older age profile. Gauteng tend lead pandemic waves. one wave tried cut travel provinces work time. 60% Gautengers soon leave provinces summer vacations visit family.


Link vaccine status age group province: Well Clark Count Today says so, must true!

/s imply travel bans wont save us all. time variant discovered, going spread around globe. Ebola airborne (yet). one product company - mRna covid vaccine

Therefore CEO perfect motivation start spouting something seems know little hope keeping share interest mean, he's saying vaccine effective.  
not good company, regardless stock market  
speculators today.

Then would share price increased greatly? likely he's claiming current vaccines work make billions new edition people take guard dreaded Omicron. 99.99999999% don’t restrictions Canada vaccinated lol. person basically living self made restrictions aren’t. yea he’s lookin troll. evidence omicron? I’ve seen actual doctors sa cases omicron far mild. HOORAY STITT AGAIN! 
fuck state... Dr Hotez said expects recently boosted person would enough antibodies provide decent defense agree. sucks take risks. think though, take risks kids time. Driving car, going swimming, feeding new food could cause allergic response... want know well.. feel left knowing. think people naturally plus 2 shots mixed booster fair better since different exposure sequence bodies seen different parts protein spike?

I'm asking read somewhere maybe heard ID Drs Moderna Pfizer use different part spike protein shots. understanding, first *identified* S. Africa, might originated there. one top countries genome sequencing reporting, may found first ones looking variants. first case Botswana. said, find concerning hospitalizations increased rapidly S. Africa, especially younger people kids. regardless whether true not, question be: 
do want initial protection vaccine prevent severe illness actually get covid get natural protection 
or 
do want much higher risk going hospital dying. 


its brainer. get vaccinated ""boosters old people young people"" confusing backed science either.

Per (pdf) Pfizer provided booster, every 10,000 booster shots, would prevent 95 cases people 18-29. words, helping less 1% population.

Comparing hospitalizations, prevent 1 hospitalization, would need give boosters to:

 * 8,738 people 18-29
 * 3,361 people 30-49
 * 2,051 people 50 64
 * 481 people 65 older 

The science Pfizer provided clearly shows initially decided ""boosters old people young people.""

They're currently testing Omicron see new variant changes figures. existing resources? huge shortage allied health professionals. Sounds good US behind many Nations stuff. people spreading variant vaccinated since they're ones travel? elaborate, firmly believe vaccinations **do provide protection unvaccinated individuals infected COVID19**.

In coming weeks, F.D.A. may also greenlight similar pill Pfizer appears significantly effective Merck’s.

Health officials around world counting new treatments reduce number severe cases save lives. Omicron causes surge severe infections, could make even important. Uh oh  They’re getting different conspiracy theories English speakers getting. Moderna - lowered dosage booster shot 1/3 normal dose they've discovered enough Delta. might enough Omicron though almost certain higher escape. Reddit loves trolling.  extent precautions wearing mask shopping that's pretty marginal intervention. much likely get infected spending holidays indoors extended family going drinks bar fifteen minutes pharmacy. takes real sacrifices close, interpersonal contact meaningfully reduce chance exposure beyond vaccinated. 

I mind masking grocery store also think we're kidding thinking going much people traveling spending time friends/family rates similar pre-pandemic, think absolutely understandable people getting back normal lives respect. Yup! question I'd really like know. got third 2 weeks Thanksgiving preparation relatives.

I know there's enough data time, really said get 4th, would. question moot really, know still question me.  Yes. common universal symptom. here. I'm much productive office.  put mask going public? new. accepting fact either take steps limit spread. million people die result. 
I see choice. Sometimes hunker needs done. Period logical thing would recommend allow immediate omicron-specific boost available current vaccine proven work (or work well) omicron.

But absolutely wouldn’t put past CDC stick arbitrary 6 month rule thereby screw everyone dutifully getting boosters now. already got boosted guess wait see. mean? eat drink mask somehow? like, want really put nail coffin already fragile industry literally reason.

It’s really argument, it’s truth. Mask mandates restaurants nothing hygiene theatre. spend majority time mask off, talking eating, 10 seconds walking restaurant makes zero difference comes airborne virus. B/T cell immunity probably work fine, I've read mutations sites 3 main classes antibody treatments target. think say high certainty many monoclonal antibody treatments work well. still work though, like without treatment. Merck Pfizer antivirals might get fast tracked omicron starts surging everywhere well. Yes, someone another thread posted transcript call among labs comment that:

""Groups seem think T-cell response still effective Omicron since limited mutations 800-1200aa range, still unclear."" sequence tiny fraction samples take.

Depends country. (like Denmark) pretty kick-ass job routinely sequencing large chunk cases.

Unfortunately countries afford tend highly-vaccinated countries, new variants likely emerge less-vaccinated countries… ""Could be. Might be. Possibly.""

ugh. actual data comes say anything want. long put words there. variant could last, say. may end world, say so. possibility yada yada.

No not. contagious, equally severe among vaccinated, severe among unvaccinated, vaccines bit less effective.

You see current chaos highly vaccinated countries like Belgium? Increase 30%. South Africa. somebody translate? isn’t sufficient charge though. widespread *here* consider concern. Fuck relief 5 months now, reduced also track variants think depends coming from. people bracing bad news vaccines offer almost nothing-infection death. highly unlikely would catastrophic. people hear infection protection takes big hit along high transmission severe disease protected, might say that’s good news. IMO likely “bad news” scenario. likely another Delta like wave.  Seems consensus far aiming towards ""It evades antibodies/immunity more, vaccines still protect severe illness"".

I'll take honestly. Every day people boosted, antiviral treatment developed. 

Now question remains much/fast spread people. easily. STOPPED like variants hits enough resistance population? (it met almost resistance SA) English version? see Hebrew. form punishment take? Twice dangerous unvaccinated sound similar Delta guess obviously differ here. Benefitting 1% population helpful, understand recommend it. That's said give entirely, okay give mostly though Haha. Every person helps. kinda like skipping voting saying one vote matter. Although true, matter 10000 people attitude. Idk, everyone lost cause. Canada started boosters yet? assumed western countries begun boosters Children 5 never serious risk Covid.   looks like contagious either way. Vaccine protects like Delta, Severe symptoms. still early say. Wall Street Journal posted interview head BioTech Pfizer states breach one layer protection second, likely. Useless racist banning travel Southern African countries including ZERO Omicron cases yet travel still open Europe emerging variant present several days South Africa even detected it.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* right here. easy task. simple ensuring developing countries access vaccines. South Africa example initially lack vaccines start year they've got enough vaccines enough take up. like 28% 1st dose last time checked. Takeup bad government asked vaccine deliveries delayed due vaccine hesitancy.

[link  Mine left ""chest."" Everytime one acts wonder fighting new exposure. Yeah, pissing around till came out, getting Thur. clear case virulence attenuation. Happened viral disease like AIDS. Less virulence = better viral particles dispersion. need solve guy's limited understanding Baskin Robbins' supply chain right now! Monoclonal antibodies seem working tremendously, although they’re really hard access reason guess end day we're miles ahead got started. 

In beginning... January 2020... had:

0 tests

0 vaccines

0 treatments

0 mask wearing

0 understanding virus

0 vaccine production/distribution infrastructure. Pentagon saving America ourselves. Go Army! Thats good example. difference war run soldiers focused results, hospitals run bureaucrats lawyers let hundred thousand deaths significantly change procedure. Thanks, I'm fully vaxed + boosted, wanted find clear set numbers determine risk. sickness booster spread people contribute keeping pandemic going   Same. minute honestly good news guess. 

At end day, we're miles ahead got started. 

We 0 tests 0 leadership covid early days. Belgium France get boosters non-immunocompromised folks 60. Tho I’m gonna wait go back US couple weeks. wait? I’m foreign student Belgium go administrative hurdles convert American vaccination card Covid safe ticket. I’ve done conversion France visited, I’ll conversion online portal get vaccination. I’m also really adamant getting Moderna booster it’s usually Pfizer booster that’s available. wearing reflector vest, also invisible? Yes, Israel 4 confirmed cases Omicron right now. data coming South Africa really low vaccination rate. silly group data like country like SA. YES - especially countries rush ban travel Africa without first getting information. 0.01% yet, dad still hours dying it. risk groups, even age, still would died someone else call 911 him. Israel already declare complete booster? Nope. Things pretty much normal. A) catch omicron infect people process. 

That’s self centered people always conveniently forget. big thing note. means ""2.4 times likely sick"" includes lot people reduced-but-still-existing efficacy. wonder stats ""Jesus vaccine""-type unvaccinated. Makes sense. “Feeling shitty, symptoms consistent covid, guess I’ll hop airplane across globe, then.” entire world can't even get access ~~a flu shot~~ clean drinking water, let alone covid vaccines. land? I’m pretty sure it’s believed originated Botswana. title post complete mistranslation then. Air travel going long since variant discovered? many cases Europe? Really starting feel like new variant turning temperature boiling frog get scary, 58 kids age 4 died COVID US since beginning pandemic. Exercise caution, course. need terrified. promised ""get shot(s) it'll over""

No not. stupid fuck! go making shit Germany... tag onto this, we've got *very* preliminary numbers, Israeli media source released data Omicron they've gotten SA. Moderna Pfizer triple jabs remain around 95% effectiveness Omicron, increase serious illness. Double jab shows 90% effectiveness, increase serious illness. unwell, fully vaccinated proof previous SARS-CoV-2 infection increased risk developing severe disease dying, including people 60 years age older comorbidities present increased risk severe COVID-19 (e.g. heart disease, cancer diabetes) advised postpone travel areas community paragraph revised align Technical considerations implementing risk-based approach international travel context COVID-19: Interim guidance, 2 July 2021

So means travel areas community spread. think making immunity stick? everything i've read something people need get every months want protected much possible. People don’t mind taking paracetamol fever, don’t see what’s psychologically exhausting taking shot. guys get quarantined Look skin colour  need defend unvaccinated status me. potential trajectory virus becoming virulent unvaccinated illicit teensiest bit concern would think. Anybody meet plane everyone get normal? keep mind counted people 2 shots “not inoculated” study. proper process conduct clinical study publishing manuscripts peer reviewed claims considered valid tested academic institutions! 

I thought id provide picture process instead pulling opinions calling truth. mean sources vet truth fiction? Without waiving patents never reach high levels vaccination prevent ever variants.

Biden admin made similar statements beginning delta wave nothing. Looks like going back play saying want waive patents take action make happen. suspect also means higher likelihood maiming people too. it’s focused 2 doses plus booster, it’s logical assume 2 doses would provide protection 1 shots. Texas. Everything bigger there. Plus Healthcare worker Floridian would rather deal especially July August. That's way efficacy numbers seem calculated approval studies. know something don't? Schroedinger's glass go USA major countries. continue travel spread shit vast majority world continues unvaccinated. fuckking release patent already! Biden promised election; what's holdup now? J&amp;J single shot March, got Moderna booster yesterday. arm feels like played (and lost) game punchies sibling, otherwise fine. J&amp;J knocked pretty hard better part day. youngest got 2nd Pfizer today far sore arm well. wife travelled today. envy life experience think heart attacks low risk profile event. Lived 10 years. He's kinda right. pfizer kids dose slightly different chemical formulation. RNA sequence still unchanged year ago, although we've numerous phase 1 trials showing multivalent vaccines give measurably better result (or result lower dosage) non-wildtype variants. Hopefully Omicron ""force upgrade"". True, depending lived. negate fact many 16-18 year kids past 6 month window 12-15 year olds given approved, August (that 5-11), post addressed. Yeah, thats mean. problem decisions made bureaucrats, Covid nowhere near dangerous enough bureaucrats make significant changes like that. thought 6 months second shot? absolutely reason get ""booster"" unless enjoy side effects. Use brain. Yep. Also countries cities need stop limiting cannot get vaccine without jumping bureaucratic hoops. Like US example, pretty much get Covid vaccine, matter you’re national another country you’re tourism anything else. Show get jab. places like “no, residents live city get it”. Getting vaccinated global effort we’re gonna move you’re preventing people show getting vaccinated. Great begin enforcing mandate everyone's vaccine wearing off... People use flair inappropriately time."
