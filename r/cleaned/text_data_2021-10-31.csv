0,2021-10-31," Always FB research new covid. Rheumatoid arthritis triggered age infections. Source: JRA 9. want people permanently mandating wear masks situations exactly? Fox Massholes looking leaves obviously /s saw Biden outside masked, Biden got booster month ago, really worried him. first study I‚Äôve seen. I‚Äôve seen claims made sides, never actual, verified data. Russian must crazy hoax 330 million people need live here. sad people died, time move pandemic. I'm sure can't see that. You‚Äôve posted comment multiple times thread asked sources, far provided any. Set appointment husband Kaiser Permanente, online asks us self-attest believe qualify CDC guidelines. believe anyway, guidelines broad feel like covers 95% population anyway. It'll week half 6 month mark second dose. Crossing fingers give us trouble appointment, though imagine want get shots arms move people through. wear mine pretty much everywhere. think unrealistic expect people forever too. lasts mere months. Yeah, I'm sure people worse like 700k dead people COVID given us

fucking insane Vaccinate live free. don‚Äôt see what‚Äôs hard that. people stuck ‚Äúexisting‚Äù  ECMO, medications keep blood pressure ICU cause toe amputations well limbs fingers, covid  Daughter woke congested morning ‚Ä¶ 6 days vaccine appt. 

Did rapid test morning negative didn‚Äôt seem get worse throughout day. 

Mostly nervous another night see brings ‚Ä¶ happy thoughts plenty things going around / even covid vast majority kids get fine would appreciated! I'm curious going give it. able stop August Delta outbreak Nanjing testing city many millions many times.

Now seems small outbreak Shanghai, going mass test largest city China?  Give vaccine people wants it.   S√£o Paulo state, Brazil, near 100% first dose adhesion, elderly estimated 93% full vaccination rate.

It's impossible. Thanks sharing info. guess likely immune response robust enough, side effects. Generally older immunocompromised people (I'm either) little side effects. Whereas younger folks, especially women, strong side effects. 

Good luck Moderna booster. Hopefully side effects bad. weirdest thing side effects vaccines, almost long fever discomfort - haha. Talk masochist.. I‚Äôm fully 3x vaccinated I‚Äôm also going live life. Uhm, no. doctor told positive I‚Äôd Covid showed pic two weird, purple, painful toes I‚Äôd back August thought ‚Äúa bad cold.‚Äù (I vaxed) papers talking about?

The study said natural immunity better Pfizer one Israel study. 
 
The Israel study said sars-covid-2 confers much greater vaccine vaccination. 
 
Since Moderna better Pfizer, cannot conclude Moderna natural immunity better. Delta know anything long term, find out. best cautious given much damage virus already title article correct. Either lazy incompetent author. 

The study said natural immunity better Pfizer one Israel study.

 Israel study said sars-covid-2 confers much greater vaccine vaccination.

Since Moderna better Pfizer, cannot conclude Moderna natural immunity better. 90%+? Keep dreaming. Guess we‚Äôll wearing masks awhile then.  Yes, sad. damage covid did. mentioned it. supposed so? CDC Covid Tracker map rough guide . Check 7 day levels community transmission area. high level spread area, take precautions.

There many places wear mask --- work, work government (judicial) facility. places wear mask choice. close talkers. 

[close think assume know vaccinated SHOULDNT CONCERTS. EVERYONE NEEDS STAY HOME. agree you. Everyone needs stay home get covid gone. Vaxxed not. agree probably fully vaccinated (and boosted), kind dumb article even mention it, since piece information newsworthy. Neither delta, either imply long term immunosuppression keep hearing back forth natural immunity vaccine immunity better. Well one it? actually know all. Lots underreporting misreporting happening 50% guess. need stop there: 150%. Yep, that's 190000+ people. makes right jumps, could easily overwhelm hospital system too. gotta consider people social love ""lock down"" mandates excuse. also gotta consider people voters using virus pretense continue comfortably nonsocial. understanding least 7 children Seattle Children's Hospital leukemia given HIV leukemia HIV somehow killed other? goal never eradicate

The goal stated whom? okay multiple goals, succeed them. say bullshit like ""the goal never eradicate"" since clearly one stated goals / hopes vaccine many people.

Even failing eradication, vaccine succeeded important goal -- saving lives allowing level normalcy. maybe mask hurt. article says tested negative via PCR everyday week Sunday. Sounds like family got Covid passed her. already quarantining them. There's people every mass shooting saying false flags Can't. They'll use fire protection  search ""Psaki vaccinated"" find news articles state indeed vaccinated. probably next year states

They're clearly chiseled stone tablet right metrics raising lowering interest rates. Federal Reserve CDC shared tablet, cut costs. ""It depends"" realistic answer definitive answer give given pandemics ever changing. US thought Winter wave vaccines widely available meant masks pretend everything normal. Delta changed punished us hubris.

People absolutely want definitive answer feels nice reassuring hear, realistic answer ""we know yet"" ""it depends"" something people want hear even come grips realistic answer. Grading curve, US numbers pretty good. 50%. give idea, ~4x swine flu 2008.

Russia estimated 3x off, India 10x last checked. many funeral pyres run wood unless things much serious reported, plus underreported/unreported slum deaths. This. goal never eradicate. save lives. much extra someone covid got fully vaxd + boostered? ... restrictions? üòÇ No, think either way. really care. point think vaccinated people cautious unvaccinated people smart enough get vaccinated. said, group vaccinated dropped precautions took before, including masks, distancing, crowds, etc. Another guy lost legs Covid hospital stay--it's something deal with, though, since died long after. holy cow, wish people would stop blowing bad flu whatever else want call it. nasty thing have. think depending rate area go without mask. pill coming good advertised could ending this. vaccinations counter treatments could over.  

I said say really know mid January. People going get together holidays.  bad spike last winter.  hopefully over. demanding answer someone way providing you. 

Probably, point we'll able drop masks achieve 90%+ full vaccination rates, daily cases dropped 3 4 digit numbers day, deaths recorded daily, held while. 

Very places point, none long point. 

That said I'm epidemiologist, know that's asking much enough. 

No one wants wear masks rest lives. want wear done. test confirm? Interesting given staffers whitr house mostly tested daily. contact president etc. comments making fun guy, they're making fun anti-vaxxers claim covid flu.  Well, them, least Black Market Matters. That‚Äôs terrible. I‚Äôm sorry. best facilities doctors world, yet can‚Äôt access overwhelmed. 

And I‚Äôm mad us done we‚Äôre supposed stay safe protect others, go back line health care covid patients take priority. wear mask get vaccine, going keep spinning wheels them, muck continue land innocent. 

I hope dad gets care needs.  Thank this. started using sky daddy everyday speech. small percentage group want boss wants oh well get laid sit home. wife MS, diabetes, Parkinson's -- auto-immune diseases run family. help parents came hill-country Kentucky everyone related other. wonder might consider lowering dose 50ug 100ug. fact Pfizer vaccine literally third dose Moderna vaccine, third reported cases myocarditis likely coincidence. sure hope tactics.

Whine claim oppressed. It‚Äôs even close HIV. Stop I'm sorry hear that. obtaining natural immunity comes cost regardless. Hope he, well family staff safe turbulent time. Paywalled article, spiking ""breakthrough cases"" unvaccinated people getting ay once? China 39 cases days ago, latest numbers skyrocketed 71 cases. 80% increase weekend. 

Things look good China. Thumbnail kinda looks like Mr. Incredible good question, important question. question nobody seems able answer. 30% people still lot burn space. She‚Äôll fine.

Says mild symptoms. point, get covid cold virtually one dies from, we‚Äôve succeeded. father unfortunately. watches much news/Facebook. disheartening  one save me 
The damage done Joe rogan shambles.   fat ass clocks 25.4, boat. agree vaccination status. experience opposite. got vaccinated dropped cautiousness. 

So go store see people wearing masks, despite local mask mandate, telling think people likely unvaccinated? good know Typhoid Marys are. scientific peer reviewed double blind uno reverso studies efficacy politicians government workers! /s Thank much link! Wholesome best match (shrug) free award... people capitalizing disaster driving anti-vaccination political similar campaigns. seen data this, doctor, think result may depend age. country relatively many breakthrough vaccinations among elderly, age group natural immunity vaccination without risk Bad faith argument. Biden already made vaccine mandate federal employees.  guys complaining it, know it. still employed, obviously vaxxed. think that's small sample, though.

My family relatives fully vaccinated (including younger ones) still wear masks, etc. one family pool closer relations less cautious that's due history vaccine similar skepticism (with new age crystal power thinking like).

In stores, still see mix majority masked people vs unmasked, somewhere around 60/40, would guess - except one notable monoculture know undervaccinated, good confidence local vaccination rates unmasked vaccinated.

So, people dropped caution shots like you, sure - majority? Probably depends local culture, thinking. another recent study Lancet said 220 days since 2nd vaccine, immunity non detectable, right?

Says 15-30 days 95%, 4 months 45% 6 7 months nothing. Check yourself, might little working memory, here's studies showing vaccine 37% effective delta, updating vaccine use deltas code? spike protein different yet use original?

Can someone explain I'm missing something Also unvaccinated tend hang unvaccinated also tend take precautions. Yeah, amazing. There‚Äôs Cleveland Clinic paper zero reinfections previously-infected group recent Israel paper also preprints (just like one) peer reviewed yet. There‚Äôs also lot older literature protection levels previous infection necessarily directly compared vaccination. Vaccine certainly better even likely get sick happening. COVID-19 side effects world's worst vaccine hope match.

Also. better either. Even sick, get shot. moderns booster yesterday. arm hurts bit, I'm achy, I'm chills, I'm fairly tired, overall think I'll fine. lot jokers running time retirement. needs 30 day notice retire. union president BBC saying much. several law suits 'natural immunity' 70% jokers already weakened CooF. prolly pressers. treatment COVID.. price pay stay alive - 8 toes lucky view.. lower back soreness also. seen one before. It‚Äôs title New CDC Study: Vaccination Offers Higher Protection Previous COVID-19 Infection

Yet contents today‚Äôs MMWR, study COVID-19 infections Kentucky among people previously infected SAR-CoV-2 shows unvaccinated individuals twice likely reinfected COVID-19 fully vaccinated initially contracting virus.

The study case-positive control design comparing vaccine + infection vaccine alone, **not** vaccine alone versus infection alone. sure conclusions title drawn.

Nonetheless, saying think study outlier. People still get vaccinated. Logic got us enlightenment. Lots things don‚Äôt make sense true. scientific method means let‚Äôs look data also let‚Äôs try prove wrong.

I know know this. don‚Äôt enough data.  Data coming.

The best data billion people vaccinated somehow it‚Äôs killing sterilizing magnetizing us.

The gop lying disinformation spreaders responsible least hundred thousand American deaths. probably it.  completely back suggestions hospitals nursing homes? think masks still mandated scenarios mentioned?

My newborn child dying mother able see face? Okay, that's choice risk. I'm going modify behavior accommodate them. Yes. explains also vaccines better others disease.

It‚Äôs simple answer. Maybe hundred years form different types vaccines could given different people based doctor dna etc. 

We pushing hard what‚Äôs best 8 billion people earth. works us. 1 percent dying doesn‚Äôt sound like fun. natural immunity vaccinated? takes risk getting infection, immune system generate antibodies parts virus? I'm saying people go get infected, way spreads pretty much inevitable we'll get point, right? TL;DR: likely join 4 coronaviruses array viruses cause common colds. 

Exposure childhood, repeated throughout life, maintain enough immunity make infections relatively mild even asymptomatic. Agreed, vaccinations saved millions. play out. Anything else harm good. I‚Äôve watched US try post mot recent articles saga. 

I keep saying don‚Äôt understand UK made choices alpha delta. 

Most people seem think cases schools half term. wait see. think unrealistic expect people forever too.

We accept salmonella poultry cook chicken 165 degrees. accept certain amount contaminants drinking water. Heck, accept patdowns airport.

Wearing mask keep people alive unrealistic. COVID. now. may while. something changes worse, may forever. saved millions lives getting people vaccinated instead letting burn America. 

When hospitals fill cautious. 

In many places going right it‚Äôs ok. *Extra safety precautions high risk scenarios seems smart good society. Permanently mandating masks every situation excessive.* agree level gererally, unvaccinated science deniers mocking precautions. Oh, definitely. very, pro vaccination. got mine soon could booster. time covid certainly time hospital. want make sure arguments present solid. Hyperbole going help. Unvaccinated people know share joints bottle whiskey.

Vaccinated people know ask need weed bowl. Always hospitals? specialists? Dentists? line drawn? go birth child wear mask whole time? baby can't see face enters world? 

Always nursing homes? people use smile most? terrible policy dulls human interaction people need desperately. 

I'm fine people making choice themselves, fuck sweeping mandate bullshit. ignorant. Funny mention underneath comment.

I aware GBS. uncle associated flu vaccine. couple years later dad got bout sepsis killed him. 

Looking back convinced mother 60‚Äôs though wasn‚Äôt diagnosed. symptoms (paralysis, etc) identical.

I might genetic risk factor GBS got vaccine first chance got. COVID much likely trigger GBS vaccines. really difficult parse data lower numbers earlier times influenced lockdowns stringent restrictions lifestyle compared later numbers. Also, important remember that, 100% people vaccinated, 100% deaths among vaccinated people. would hope, someone knows data patient maybe expand this, happens total deaths going fewer die people vaccinated. is, 1000 unvaccinated people caught COVID, 10 people would die. 1000 vaccinated people caught COVID, I'd think 2 would die. 

Of course, people vaccinated issues would play that. People vaccine immunocompromised benefit less vaccines likely die get sick bodies diminished ability develop immunity age would factor well. 

The article mentions early vaccination waning resistance, I'd also guess delta something things playing out. lesson anything, pandemic complex thing vaccines potent weapon, one employ. think reason get vaccinated run around like there's nothing wrong looking complicated things are. like suit armor covers every vulnerable part body. like bullet-proof vest protecting vulnerable areas. expect idiot government lifts mask social distancing mandates. Even fucking *Americans* (*cough* *splutter*) handled pandemic better; least well run states. 

It embarrassing Brit reckless we‚Äôve been, especially country obsessed health safety! third dose raises immunity many times higher second. case nearly every vaccine: there's 1-2 doses prime immune system another one much later remind it. obsession waning immunity misplaced. got mine last week CVS MA. asked vaccine card. reaction 2nd, exhaustion, fever, chills, headache. That‚Äôs lesson. say ivermectin useful year I‚Äôll go it. thought me... Covishield astrazeneca vaccine afaik. studied heavily. quite safe, former good, latter certainly okay. 

Get one AZ dose asap. Time make SMART health cards ubiquitous. reason states/pharmacies can't  
 issue every vaccinated American. make verification much much easier, stop liars pulling stunts. bunch entities across US/Canada already support  ivermectin cabinet (for chickens.)

I go get Regeneron got covid. fully vaccinated happy also use regeneron period hospitals filling I‚Äôm 90% still masks lockdowns force.  Delta around since long July  Well verified data verified again. It‚Äôs early types studies coming out.

The trouble natural immunity idea wanes hoping get reinfected, rest us trying keep bay?

I‚Äôm glad things going back normal now.  study design poorly described university PR piece. [Here's clearer explanation someone actually referred study. Ah yes, good scientist let us know prediction 100% likely true. feel I've seen headline before... It‚Äôll never gone, we‚Äôll get better treating it. Even did, somehow, disappear lot damage already done. world shown idea manage pandemic. Blame whichever figure head want happen again. You‚Äôre likely worse case covid you‚Äôre unvaccinated.

Most people likely catch without long term effect. percent across popukation millions people.

Because many old people got vaccinated (and may need boosters keep way) million less people die.

Many people catch end lifelong injury. 

I‚Äôm guessing natural vaccine immunity wane time. 

All viruses different. (And one mutating time.)  Maybe allergies? sometimes wake sore throat, runny nose post-nasal drip go away next day thanks whatever allergens inhaled asleep. 

Another possibility dry air. gotten cold live heat kicked on, maybe air drier causing congestion. believe it. 

I used fly. lot. flight almost weekly years. 

I never felt less safe cab rides airports.  really asking natural immunity sufficient need extra vaccine top that. think best advice trust doctor instead reddit (Preferably one give ivermectin), Israeli study  majority population vaccinated huge delta wave ripping unvaxxed communities, likelihood huge surge seems small. likely small, localized waves following thanksgiving/Christmas, covid running people infect.  comes daily dose world vague claims. needs vaccine save him. Battling predictions. Let‚Äôs hope best. Among states, Vermont #1 vaccination, #49 cases per capita #50 deaths per capita. story non-issue. honestly see made print first place.      I'm airline pilot, I've spent past 15 years flying professionally. people shocked tell closest I've ever come dying job nothing airplane -- way hotel airport Ottawa very, close call drunk driver going southbound northbound lane 100km/h. driver exceptionally alert, we'd dead sure, would head-on collision roughly 180km/h closing speed Prius drunk driving large pickup truck. experience I've ever airplane comes remotely close near death morning, that's saying lot, I've fire airplane.  Yeah booster too. little tender 3 days took week go away. right, effectiveness data generally pre-Delta. mRNA vaccines effective pre-Delta, indications Moderna actually works better.  meta-analysis still preprint status. cannot find anywhere peer reviewed. great curiosity take anything concrete it. Certainly share evidence. very, pro vaccination feel causes least harm across board. However, sharing preprint studies evidence bad form bad science. Let's that.  Thank god. Zero covid farce. Cases matter people vaccinated. hope wasn‚Äôt heart. study still preprint. methodology analysis peer reviewed. take anything concrete it. supposed read headline. Blasphemer!! Imagine lived things like Smallpox, AIDS, saying... well expose get natural immunity, rather taking couple free vaccinations.   think society makes sense always wear one sick public. 

Also hospitals nursing homes reduce spreading cold, flu, covid etc. 

Extra safety precautions high risk scenarios seems smart good society. Permanently mandating masks every situation excessive.  I‚Äôm expert either, intuitively seems like body challenged billions spike protein course active infection would produce robust secondary immune response even stabilized spike low dose vaccine. That‚Äôs interesting counter examples though, I‚Äôm gonna go look good read struggling feeling good today booster yesterday. Part asking Covid feels. Body aches completely zapped energy, second shit got nausea tiredness aches time nausea body aches tiredness kicking ass. Still would chose booster side effects whatd probably happen Covid even ending HCA nominee. I‚Äôd rather day end vent, cheers everyone else who‚Äôs vaccinated anyone who‚Äôs not, hopefully articles like may change mind post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

If absolutely incapable reaching, however... know. Take people endangering others, unnecessarily extending pandemic guess.    get both, thats did. got covid, 2 modernas booster. i‚Äôll never get covid.  long waiting list. don‚Äôt know, can‚Äôt find anywhere Google, many people vaccinated. assume least 2,000 qualified candidates. there‚Äôs academy training, takes 18 weeks, followed probationary period 6-24 months. Starting salary $45,000 year, goes $100,000 5 years. 

You live near New York City, though, making $45,000 starting salary little tricky unless live home multiple roommates. cheaper rent, commute going suck. drivers license apply, lot city kids simply don‚Äôt have. Agree. need able freely events again- concerts, theater, festivals, etc- masks. know much coercion use eake vaccinations, worth it. Soon anyone 5 get want. kids need 100% normal school. feel bad kids deal school. poorly written... someone did't digest info well start own. Definitely. Also, add drive trucks Punisher decal them. That‚Äôs small peen dudes anymore. calling ""suspected""? **7,348 (7.8%) lab-confirmed COVID-19**. Among group, 1,020 hospitalizations among previously infected unvaccinated people, 6,328 cases among fully vaccinated people previously infected.

They're already confirmed, study makes sense.

Surely vaccinated people population outnumbered 6 1 (especially compared *previously infected* unvaccinated), 6 times many hospitalized? owning clothing aggressive eagle and/or American flag it? Natural immunity you‚Äôve recovered I‚Äôm unvaccinated don‚Äôt leave house 201k hospitalised covid like illness.

94k test (positive negative)

7k (positive negative) actually fit extremely narrow criteria either unvaccinated previous positive test (more 90 days ago) fully vaccinated previous negative test.

Of 7k fit criteria, 413 tested positive.

Of 413 tested positive, 89 reinfections unvaccinated. 324 breakthrough cases.

I might post separate comment, since seems like lot people trouble table. Whichever pays journal published in. consider costs logistics testing everyone see get one shot two shots, seems nutty. can't take someones word lie you. burning building firefighter rescued me, wouldn‚Äôt care vaccinated. Unlikely. Many vaccines four five dose regimes, effective immunity lasts life.

COVID also relatively stable low-mutating. see lot mutation right much world inadequately vaccinated. slow vaccinated vaccines adjusted meet new evolution. Fortunately, mRNA vaccines easy tweak.

We may see doses required next years, stabilize. natural immunity provides little bit protection you.. survive. Yeah downside risk vaccines limited. True harm exceptional cases. upside positive.

Compare getting covid. downside risks real present. include death ruined health. mention even high risk infect people are.

1) would possible stop early.

2) possible get COVID zero, exceedingly improbable.

But need know started covid-like illness would also people hospital test positive symptoms ‚Ä¶ ones came elective surgery idea even exposed. Thank explaining this! comment really helped understand. wanted add personal experience mine. Last week attended dinner 5 fully vaxxed friends. unvaccinated extremely mild covid year ago (slight temperature day gone), husband brother lives us asymptomatic. Since dinner, everyone bar myself, tested positive covid described experience terrible debilitating flu- completely bed ridden. early 30‚Äôs. Yesterday saw another young yet doubly vaccinated friend incredibly sick 2 weeks breakthrough covid. aunt last month breakthrough covid.  Multiple friends colleagues breakthrough covid experiencing severe symptoms friends caught covid prior vaccine roll out. observation course, seems vaccinated especially cautious infection far prone/vulnerable since injection. get breakthrough case, super immune?  way 2 per year? joking except fact really get Didn‚Äôt Spanish Flu suddenly disappeared couple years initial outbreak?   Friend there. Everyone tested able leave. shared video people lines nurses tests row tables castle fireworks going background. get home 6am next morning. whole heartedly support vaccines... question.  Israeli study showed people covid much greater immunity vaccinated. got immunity naturally given freedoms vaccinated?  ask australian point view certain freedom's denied unvaxxed. Ditto. topic hot debate family I‚Äôd love see they‚Äôre doing. entirely correct. variolation cowpox started. Basically Edward Jenner noticed people caught cowpox get smallpox. developed method infect people using blisters cow, call variolation.

Then forefather, George Washington mandated soldier undergo procedure (which kind ironic, giving arguments constitution).

Then vaccine developed based that, much safer need carry sick cow perform variolation.

BTW: also anti-vax started, imagine current antivaxers reacting injecting cow puss :::adds two more: goatee wrap around sunglasses::: thing make confuse is, number unvaccinated vs vaccinated opposite. Like 5 times likely get disease people hospital unvaccinated covid? number comparison weird.  China seems trouble latest outbreak. Friend Shanghai Disneyland suddenly shut down. guests take test leaving park, get home 6 next morning. generates clicks. absolute Darth Obi-Wan Yep millennial here, tell chickenpox, cousins came get me.  Antivax legally obligated take vaccine   Bad medicine needs  Supposedly antibody immune memory.  Hyperbolutes! term Jedi would tell about. There's headline?  Yep. older folks got those. used send girls kids Rubella, wouldn‚Äôt pregnant. still mask mandates major cities majority schools. serious travel restrictions, that‚Äôs another topic. 

I‚Äôm one argue masks schools - yes kids protected, schoolchildren eligible vaccination coming days needs discussion endgame.

But ending masks adults cities definitely needs discussed. It‚Äôs mostly protect people aren‚Äôt willing protect themselves. Everyone 12 able get vaccinated months months now. point life returns full normal - means requiring masks. No, Sunday yesterday. Feel better soon! You‚Äôre missing vaccines still highly effective hospitalization death. Symptoms started around Wednesday. So, around day 5 surprising considering latest data hospitals. showed people covid basically guaranteed hospitalized, matter vaccine status. true.

That study you‚Äôve linked infection (do test positive not).  note protection severe illness stayed higher 9 months, waning selected groups.

This study 
a) looking people hospital
b) mostly cases much lower gap full vaccination subsequent test.  Last cases August. Vaccines widely available April?  That‚Äôs 4 months.
c) protection natural infection also wane.  study try account secondary analysis (it wouldn‚Äôt fair compare protection natural infection year ago protection vaccination last month). Still similar results. argument sister uses justify getting vaccine even though she‚Äôs antibody texts confirm doesn‚Äôt enough her. she‚Äôs falling thst sus. Like wtf Nevada one place clear offramps that; commended.  US donated 214 million doses October 25, used 510 million population. Thats 28% doses US available. United States, chickenpox parties popularized introduction varicella vaccine 1995. Children also sometimes intentionally exposed common childhood illnesses, mumps measles. vaccines infections became available, parents regarded diseases almost inevitable    Lol, OK. figured China shutdown Wuhan. even I‚Äôm sure someone accuse anti-vax despite 3X now.  wrong. I'm vaccination. Everyone know vaccinated. I'm destroying world. people refuse return doing. mass casualty events going on. That's normal. 20,000 people died Florida could slightly normal summer. 

Those places may end pandemic now. places suppressed delta wave still work minimize breakthrough deaths try get everyone prefers covid vaccination hospital bed. 2736 vaccinations? they've basically stopped? lymphocyte article didn‚Äôt even make claim, either. 

My wife internist. She‚Äôs hundreds patients get it. handful died. gone lives. 

Haven‚Äôt folks influenza? Chicken pox? Mono? Maybe not. also cause weird long term illness (shingles sucks). Eventually everyone going get nasty. Get it. us going die anyway. May well live then.

Long term can‚Äôt suppress virus forever. It‚Äôs impractical. keep making better vaccines move on. Latest news China incident:

Case A, visited Disneyland Oct. 30, tested night found close-contact another confirmed case diagnosed days ago. following day (Oct. 31) result came positive. Fuck em. can‚Äôt read Yes. They're testing lot per capita Japan don‚Äôt understand thread all. try pretty level headed evidenced based person damn, HIV? Like that‚Äôs even close parroting one group's ""ignore COVID-19 ramifications, get back 'normal'"" proclamations irresponsibly making since long began.

Many regions adapted already better vaccination rates pandemic behaviors safely led anti-vaccination/anti-masking leadership.

Those bad actors, directing large swaths people avoid vaccinations, masks distancing led generational harm describe.

Nice try adding blame group pushes universal vaccinations, appropriate distancing, mask wearing, etc. get back better keel quickly, opposed group's messages resist vaccinations - we've seen - cause extensions pandemic especially delta variant locations.

Sorry, ""upside-down up"" day. Man, it‚Äôs incredible folks linking articles don‚Äôt even understand making outrageous claims. 

And actual scientists saying likely wane time become another endemic corona somehow wrong. 

Follow science scares you? You‚Äôre wrong, could imagine mask policies also help remind people there‚Äôs pandemic happening therefore need things stem spread. don‚Äôt want people scared time, consistently cautious seems healthy now.

But lord knows I‚Äôll welcome time leave house without mask.  read natural impunity.   sith deals absolutes! heck downvoting people. Unless it‚Äôs racist shit trying sell warranty. Unfortunately many people fail part Hyperbole never helps. Ever. state lists consider underlying medical conditions...mine's included I'm sure right, thought level nuking hurricanes. That's are, politicians moneyed class believing complete hokum detriment. ...awesome.

:(   lots projection here! ‚ÄúConfirmed‚Äù mean positive negative.

It‚Äôs 7,000 hospitalised covid like illness.  Nearly covid test (thus results definite/confirmed). huge majority tested negative.  

The 324 subgroup tested positive (and double vaccinated). Obviously people going tested covid

Perhaps. say Covid positive hospitalized people? sounds like counting whole group, positive ones.  Vaccines 1 target, case spike protein. natural infection multiple proteins present, become targets. 

Natural infection utilizes cell based immunity cells activated kill infected cells. 

The immune system numerous interactions itself, understand them. lots reasons could case. article doesn‚Äôt demonstrate long term immunosuppression. people wrong. seven day average trend started dropping schools broke half term. average incubation period 5-7 days beginning see effect school holidays now, continue week. Whatever causing flattening isn‚Äôt schools.  scare stories designed frighten anti maskers anti vaxxers getting heads asses end irrationally scaring people already vaccinated wearing masks. Rinse repeat. got J&amp;J April soon eligible. got BAD case COVID July. didn‚Äôt want take chances soon well enough, got Moderna shots well. Hope don‚Äôt get again. wife COVID twice she‚Äôs first responder. got first time last December vaccines available got second time got it. Yet study israel claims complete opposite.  Lol care much wrote two previous responses settling one.  false. 5 X 0 ability = also 0 ability. 
It's better working scale factor. Article bit wrong.  

Go study.  It‚Äôs 7k confirmed positive cases, it‚Äôs 7k people met inclusion criteria (positive negative).  

Then 7k, 450 tested positive. (89 reinfections, 324 breakthroughs).

Once adjust age (older people likely get hospitalised likely vaccinated), see 5 fold difference protection. Probably, point we'll able drop masks achieve 90%+ full vaccination rates, daily cases dropped 3 4 digit numbers day, deaths recorded daily, held while.

So never Good luck poison  right. possible I'll add one thing response somewhat smug message apparent missed point mine.

You can't *prove* excess deaths covid *agree* point *likely* covid deaths, simply can't fucking prove it, can't use it.

It's literally common sense. work everything else quite literally speculation based probability possibility. mean doubt, both? get R number less 1, would rob people everything makes life worthwhile lockdowns.  Fuck governor dude pandemic made hate passion. fault lifting mandates soon refusing bring back meaningful capacity. cares career lives constituents. 95% cases vaccine induced myocarditis mild completely reversible without treatment. Ok, fair point.  doctors dumb.  

Just clarity, case get tested arrived hospital though. might‚Äôve misread it? since passed away, daughter confronting urgent care mum still alive. Exactly. selfish assholes don‚Äôt want get vaccinated? stay home ride get Covid since it‚Äôs, know ‚Äújust like flu‚Äù. I‚Äôm fully vaccinated getting Covid. definitely ‚Äújust like flu‚Äù can‚Äôt imagine bad might someone wasn‚Äôt vaccinated. sorry loss. antivaxxers LAST people receive treatment, all. right, bad. death numbers meaningless without looking total case lazy check sources, CFR looks like per age group. Deaths 0-17 subgroups broken out, 558 0-17 combined.

      Cases  Deaths CFR
  0-4   913472	558	   0%
  5-11  1947493      0%
  12-15  1555870      0%
  16-17  992246      0%
  18-29  7905428	4156  0.1%
  30-39  5991815	12217  0.2%
  40-49  5244638	30090  0.6%

So 50 0.6% chance dying, numbers pre-delta; death rate delta higher younger age groups. hit 50 death rate jumps 1%. reference, average flu season 0.1% CFR across age groups COVID much deadly contagious average flu.

The vaccines also help keep people hospital, detail missed look death rates. hospitalized COVID bills range $40k $150k without insurance. Even insurance people going end paying $10-20k depending plan. Great, survived, get spend rest lives paying debt declare bankruptcy. mention 30% people end long COVID, may never return normal may end disabled life.

It's fucking stupid claim natural immunity best way. Even vaccine immunity strong long-lasting (even though plenty studies shows is), require people risking lives getting infected COVID. vaccine immunity wears year, fine, go get another vaccine. get yearly flu shots already. There's also work nasal oral immunizations, *can* provide sterilizing immunity stop virus gets past mucous membranes. survive?? Total deaths US 700,000, 45+million cases (plus mild/asymptomatic cases never recorded. That's chance survival

I'm sure first sentence means. quote second sentence contradicted common observation milkmaids generally immune smallpox, Jenner postulated pus blisters milkmaids received cowpox (a disease similar smallpox, much less virulent) protected smallpox. 

Jenner noted common observations make himself, though postulate happening.

Your third sentence contradicted quote. method already developed others, Jenner popularized procedure. verified people got immune. last bit contradicted variolation used solely talking inoculating people using smallpox. time vaccination referred inoculating people using cowpox like Jenner. word coined 1800, Vaccinia=cowpox virus. 1891 Pasture widened definition vaccination methods inducing immunity.

I doubt next infection I'll even notice. Oh, I'm diabetic. lot ""very online"" set young, never experienced anything like this, extremely short term outlooks. sound rude, little like talking timeframes child act something happening day literally FOREVER. 

Couple impatience DOOM hot takes designed maximum Internet Snark Cred, get discourse tainted unable advance realms realism.  Bingo got 4! body naturally fights viral invasion possibly tell natural borne antibodies strong synthetically enhanced dead proteins?! Make makes sense. guess question -- much would masking table indoor restaurant reduce spread order worth it?

If say, hypothetically, masking indoor restaurant table reduced spread infected people 1%, would worth it?

For me, inconvenience low reduces spread amount, worth it.

And likely reduces spread? I'm epidemiologist, yes, seems likely reduces spread degree. sitting eating typical restaurant, are, say, somewhere 4 8 people within 6-foot radius you, excluding people party. tables, possible many 8 people walk within 6 feet course meal walk table restroom. people actively shedding virus, protection wearing mask closer you. also better protection waiting seated, restroom.

People sometimes treat covid risk binary on/off condition, fundamentally probabilistic condition. take many forms risk mitigation get, especially easy convenient wearing mask minutes restaurant I'm table. Well they're full something gets done anyways. 50+ diabetic original strain, long Covid, multiple exposures (without much sniffle), 2 vaccine shots ""breakthrough"" sinus pain post nasal drip. day half. 

Have third shot now. least bit concerned future infection. Kills H.I.V Aids last time checked...still crack heads think joke.. thing is, really know. possible make educated guesses based similar things happened before, there's certainty.  
 
The problem time virus chance reproduce, means chance mutate. chance mutate, there's always chance could mutate something worse. people getting vaccinated currently, provides chances - rolls dice - virus mutate something like. Reducing opportunities mutate vaccination makes worst-case scenarios less likely. think influenza mutate much faster 1921 mutated less virulent strain like thr common flo.

But Covid slow mo.

So slow varrients mutants yet. Can't get covid close people make sick. Masks can't socially distance, otherwise social distancing lot better. OFFICIAL death toll maybe, we‚Äôre pretty sure real toll higher that. Heck, I‚Äôve seen estimates 5 million deaths India alone.  Good article good source links. Worth clicking read whole article. like think way, Covid early last year, 3 vaccine shots far body concerned I've 4 exposures virus already, I'm much along endemic timeline refusing. Today first day back school millions children England half-term holidays. 

The UK surge largely driven unvaccinated children schools without masks social distancing. next week pivotal - hopefully surge abating, possible reduction cases we've seen last ~10 days mainly due schools out, cases pick schools back session. remain 90% effective couple months, that's issue here.

UK less deaths per million US

UK one case every 8 people. US one case every 7 people.

Do anything showing ""far inferior"" hidden camera interviews Pfizer scientist saying opposite. know, article implies Covid-19 vaccines mandatory, aren't. Hospitals right refuse unvaccinated patients, unless medical condition prevented vaccinated.

Stupidity medical condition. enough information point know ‚Äúnatural immunity‚Äù far inferior vaccination. yet two months later study still pre-print, peer review, clarity narrowed population 600k vaccinated patients mere 16k comparison.

There's attempt study ensure subset selected model representative group selected from: two groups compared similar across number potential covariates.

If study actually worth damn would published somewhere notable instead left pre-print MedArxiv soak shares social media. newborn child can‚Äôt see face regardless. actually quite sure natural immunity works yet. Similar viruses like 2002 SARS gave people decades long immunity. calculated 16 (+/-2) million deaths worldwide end year.  oil-generated-in-the-earth theory comes Thomas Gold actually legit scientist came correct theories lot stuff, reading career pretty interesting think another reason engineers scientists fall victim conspiracy theories/pseudoscience study college-level physics engineering, see lot elegant mathematically ""pretty"" explanations world works. theories satisfying want everything explanation like that. course, world complicated messy, lots cases there's never going single equation explaining everything. there's still strong desire one insight making everything fall place.. lot conspiracy theories promise.

Yes are. It‚Äôs got rid polio smallpox. They‚Äôve around long time. It‚Äôs mandated kindergarten/entrance public schools. read way either. actually agree you.

And yes, ends endemic, we'll get eventually. ""We determined mandatory wearing masks exhibits effects similar maintaining 2-m social distancing preventing COVID-19. Mandatory wearing masks practicing social distancing masks peak hours reduced infection rates 93.5 98.1%, respectively.""  aware lots people still die covid? curious.

These people full think hold city hostage, they're dead wrong. Luckily, they're small percentage overall population city workers. Vaccination durable natural infection? know how? giving boosters precisely vaccination declines significantly 6 months? studies showing long lasting (15 months) neutralising immunity infection?

I've skin game. Infected vaccinated. IIRC Sixteen Military Wives, one older ones. idea flags set, database? funding problem sort much bigger problem huge walkout Nurses hospital staff last 2-3 years. Physically Beds (especially ICU) available staff handle (potential) amount patients. 

There even lower number Hospital workers, especially nurses, right Germany 2020.

JHU's global tally deaths reached 5,000,425 4:50 a.m. ET Monday. reports 197,116 people died Covid-19 worldwide past 28 days. number coronavirus cases officially reported globally stands 246.7 million since first detected Chinese city Wuhan late 2019. Even Israeli study said natural immunity also get vaccinated:

""The researchers also found people SARS-CoV-2 previously received one dose Pfizer-BioNTech messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine highly protected reinfection virus still unvaccinated."" current knowledge breakthrough infections smell loss / neurological problems. reports? point chance go endemic, could reasonably argued getting neither would lowest risk. Earlier covid strains really infectious, avoiding option.

Post delta, that's longer case. going get it. unlikely get even vaccinated. do, going much better immune system head start vaccinated.

The main objection currently think could bit better tailoring vaccine selection individuals. seem differences rates side effects various groups, taking account deciding vaccine use could least make psychological difference.

It might possible due way distribution happens - places seem one kind - which, think, unfortunately reinforces appearance concern around safety efficacy mainly herd level rather individuals. Giving least appearance trying find best variant patient could something acceptance levels, least margins. earliest studies safe. I've flying fully booked flights since March 2020, regular basis, globally, terminal illness. worries all.

The potential product susceptibility: 100% immunologically naive, smaller % infected, vaccinated, boosted, varying age, **prevalence infection**

Developing countries decent excuse reporting numbers - literally don‚Äôt money resources track COVID cases/deaths. 

They probably enough problems calculating accurate deaths pandemic mode.

I'm going go back I've trying get across 18 months ... Prior COVID, (relatively accurate) actuarials trend lines. upended pandemic. way arrive numbers reasonable margin error, wait burns out, reestablish metrics. Then, delta two tell *how many people died still alive*. people died COVID, already due (from statistical viewpoint), others not. arrive true picture impact. I'm going bold say that's red flag. Basically equivalent recycling programs  mentioned /u/MyFacade, Despite repetitive claims thread contrary, *are* guidelines CDC today related High+ transmission; and, posted elsewhere thread - consistent target offered Fauci since March 2020 restrictions (30 cases per 1M residents daily associated 1.6% CFR). see State accurately County High Severe Transmission Scroll Risk Levels Vaccination Levels switch view Counties. 


Sadly, metrics set, sometimes see states find ways meet metric regardless actually happening state -- know reliability state county's reporting look numbers (ex: Okeechobee Co FL -- seem likely county 48% vaccination rate would atypically low case rate, especially seeing status neighbors?). cite random stranger internet. like him! Thank god found someone agree with!

I would look more. Plexiglass protect virus, protects antivaxxers lunging across counter you. think time goes we'll get better understanding long natual immunity vs. vaccinated immunity lasts. I've read medical experts studies saying natural immunity reliable getting vaccinated safe vaccines (if known condition prevents getting it), go ahead get vaccinated, even already studies study (admittedly small \[72 people\]) showed infected necessarily mean body produce antibodies. study showing (again small sample size), showing antibodies falling 60 days positive infection.

Like said above, think agree good research needed.

Without answers, I'll go experts say. extremely limited understanding have, actual studies tend line say much closer random chumps facebook. main thought I've precautions since Covid happened ""... wait done before?""

So, either create maintain effective border controls live relatively normal life inside borders; society covid endemic, injections every six months, hundreds deaths per day, defence resilience next variant comes view. hope every adult got vaccinated vaccinates kids (and kids elegible). help significantly lot inter-family transmission happens kids school. read article. re-read post.

Chicken pox special case: highly infectious disease *for vaccine* enormously less severe children adults. Without three things--and especially dynamic mild childhood illness major illness adulthood--there reason anyone get live varicella. And, obviously, there's vaccine, there's reason all.

They've filed almost everywhere except US. We'll see happens. lying ""win"" arguments.

""You're telling immune system strong enough deal virus that's killed almost *three quarters million Americans*, can't handle vaccine shot two 80% adults had?""

""If scared shots, admit that, okay."" necessarily cheapest factor lot things: access said food (because food deserts exist) time spent preparing food come play.

It may cost less screen, there's that. I‚Äôve wondering months also PA wife nurse ltcf I‚Äôm pretty interested. Pretty sure announced Biden late July/early august.

I'm sure view deaths vaccinated individuals. personally, know 2 last month myself. 1 morning.  Note, allow exception a‚Äústrong moral ethical conviction.‚Äù

Why include this? reason Pitt took long announce vaccine mandate. Pitt considered semi-public university.

Fomite transmission theoretically possible put hand directly into, like, fresh sputum infected person rub eyes, outside kind extreme situation, happen. point article we've gotten wrapped tracking cases, we've lost thread we're really trying move forward. 

It's long past time stop focusing raw case counts, throw asinine CDC map, focus hospitalizations deaths amongst vaccinated people.  Jimmy John's appreciation meal last month. told order drinks bring own. wish still got pizza point.

Yea, that's lot people getting -- yes, COVID might high survival rate scale, even survive, might fair number long-term debilitating effects. probability death long COVID severity correlate certain conditions.

Someone peak physical health minor commodities (e.g, they're like 5 pounds less overweight, hay fever activated catch COVID) may \~99.999% chance survival. chances getting getting Long COVID may also like \~99.99%. 

Probability calculations based heavily givens.

For example, high rate survival 99.999% might look like this: P(Survival | Good Health, Non-Active Allergies, Recently Ill, Immuno-compromise, Favorable Genetic Markers, Ideal Weight, Age &lt; 50.) = 99.999%

So odds survival 99.999% given good health, active allergies, sort illness (even cold stomach bug) recently,  immune compromised way, near ideal weight, age 50. Odds significant chronic long-COVID also really low, maybe 0.002%.

However, odds survival might 75% is...

P(Survival | Okay Health, Active Pollen Allergy, Cold Last Month, Immuno-Compromise, one disfavorable genetic marker, 25% Ideal Weight, Age 50) = \~75%, chances Long-COVID may even statistically high well. might statistical likelihood (10%+) form long-COVID.

Yes, vaccinated individuals - vast majority either elderly weak immune systems immunocompromised produce robust vaccines kind - make small minority die COVID. 

Even areas/countries vast majority population vaccinated, unvaccinated population comprises lion‚Äôs share COVID fatalities. 

I‚Äôm glad agree compelling evidence efficacy COVID vaccine. reasonable wait get booster checked antibody level 6+ months vaccinated? 

Since every body different, makes sense get booster vaccines efficacy actually starts wear off. say wanes time, know that's what's happening body? blood test show antibody levels. they're measuring efficacy time?

I'm demographic listed receiving Pfizer booster anyway, know lots people getting regardless. ‚ÄúEventually everyone exposed SARS-CoV-2,‚Äù says Dr. Abraar Karan, who‚Äôs infectious disease specialist Stanford University. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs matter whether you‚Äôre exposed you‚Äôre fully vaccinated you‚Äôre vaccinated.‚Äù

I've trying drive point home now. longer question get Covid, solely question WHEN. Agreed. think people afraid never move covid. That's necessarily true, everyone vaccinated yet incautious person. number people staunchly anti-vaxx also believe COVID-19 actually pretty small...the media unfortunately shown us primarily stories far larger group people either confused, uncertain, delayed. Plus, people may start taking risks vaccinated - started eating restaurants limited travel got mine. Eh, given way world works, transmissible thing + transmissibility pre-symptomatic phase..I‚Äôd say die cast time infected handful people. 

China sure hell didn‚Äôt help matters secretive, viruses right combination attributes able spread far wide, COVID fits bill. Mostly hubris.

A 71% vaccination rate nowhere close herd immunity. Natural immunity low. waiting till 5-11 age group got vaccinated lifting mask mandates (or vax mandate indoor dining etc least). 

The fact Vermont state obscures fact population lower San Francisco Manhattan, higher vaccination rates Vermont dampened Delta wave high levels masking (either voluntary mandated) indoor vaccine mandates. live rural Saskatchewan, here. know women got vaccinated hide husbands well high school kids got vaccinated hiding parents. Yea let say need 4 Billion left first dose 4.8 billion second 8 billionn third, world still need 16.8 billion doses. Better safe check 100% assurance always wonder worry. X-ray shouldn‚Äôt take long get.  believe workaround could potentially apply everyone.  infinity beyond....   countries 75+% vaccination rate, still using case numbers KPI? That's kinda point vaccinated though. touring musician, wondering time days. big enough tour, enough people crew, testing every day, it‚Äôs likely someone eventually gonna catch COVID. then, what, shut tour two weeks, forever? live enetertainment business changes model shows consistently getting cancelled, threatening people‚Äôs livlihoods? never change official policy slowly stop testing time? curious play out. r/COVID19_support bad it?

Social distancing vain attempt controlling spread Western societies initially (and still are) reluctant wear masks. would argue everyone masked up, marginal benefits social distancing greatly eclipsed inconveniences introduces. try living high rise restricted occupancy elevators.

Instead, look places like Tokyo still pack transit system without huge outbreak everyone everyone wearing masks. complete guess. data excess deaths give better idea. limits far undercounted. qualify yet. Soon though!   thought kidding actual quote article... diseases, natural immunity stronger vaccines (Chickenpox example find). cases (HPV, tetanus), vaccines better. gather depends vaccine design, dose, exposure, good old fashion dose ""we fully understand immune system know why"".

So way really tell large scale studies, case case basis. gather (I'm expert), can't really ""reason"" stronger without studies, pointing random examples vaccines work either, since case case. Going enjoy stories firefighters sick covid already burnt sick leave via protesting.  Canadian government recommanded mixing vaccines including AstraZeneca, Pfizer &amp; Moderna.

It 5x better, several times better infection challenge =denoting enhanced reaction body's immune system antigen related antigen previously encountered.  That's outdated. CDC's current guidelines even fully vaxxed individuals without symptoms still quarantine 3-5 days get tested. I'm wondering getting booster would harmful exposed COVID. UK study? SIREN showed 99% protection confirmed probable reinfection. CDC study Kentucky case-positive control design means positivity rates compared *among get tested* introduces bias ‚Äî importantly, **it study compared vaccinated infected people infected unvaccinated people**. CDC title article is:

[New CDC Study: Vaccination Offers Higher Protection Previous COVID-19 actual today‚Äôs MMWR, study COVID-19 infections Kentucky among people previously infected SAR-CoV-2 shows unvaccinated individuals twice likely reinfected COVID-19 fully vaccinated initially contracting virus.

They made statistical comparison vaccine + infection infection... vaccine versus infection. Unless missed something study. possibility use ""stabilized spike protein"" chosen less affected mutations. want party power actually smart COVID policies?

Yes. Religion politics tied together. is.  Ok, let's jump religion Politics? Yep, I‚Äôd guess young kids can‚Äôt vaccinated probably asymptomatic carriers. CDC guidance states fully vaccinated, quarantine exposed Covid unless develop symptoms. ""I immune system!""

That's like guns, refusing ammo ""I guns!"" many boosters people take they're young healthy? Maybe nominally long pervasive get mutations significantly dangerous, hell covid dangerous **based viral load** Delta significantly dangerous **and** infectious.

Don't hold breath going get mundane time soon first sentence comment nailed it. Thanksgiving table conversation going be‚Ä¶uhhh interesting year. Oh BMI get booster? Shit I'll look morning.

this Reddit comment, Tbf. Noise. vaccines far effective differing lipid micelle serious difference two, that's relevant difference two. [This paper, titled ‚ÄúAnti-SARS-CoV-2 Antibodies Persist 13 Months Reduce Risk found 97% protection Overall, 69 SARS-CoV-2 infections developed COVID-19 negative group (incidence 12.22 per 100 person-years) versus one COVID-19 positive group (incidence 0.40 per 100 person-years), indicating relative reduction incidence SARS-CoV-2 reinfection 96.7%

Yeah guidelines leave LOT room interpretation. literally underlying medical condition would include literally anything. Anxiety medical condition anxious COVID would technically qualify even yes, bit stretch terms real risk.

If actually vaccine shortage yes, I'd save shots risk easily available without wait appointment there's point trying restrict this.

The vast majority American overweight would already qualify like 70% entire goddamn country. Damn. bad it? live crowded area? Semelweiss put shit hundreds years ago makes present day nonsense outrageous.  caught vaccines? talking like 90s? I‚Äôll trade years, sure. 

But I‚Äôd much rather travel world, paraglide mountains, camp Serengeti, ride occasional motorcycle, drink drinks live forever. 

Life without risks boring. Life many risks short. Gotta find middle.

Yep. vaccines, boosters treatments. Long term it‚Äôs likely become yet another background coronavirus we‚Äôll get exposed get boosted annually. 

We‚Äôll go back living life go on. 

The idea going stay bad forever asinine. People need start accepting it‚Äôs never going away folding risk in. It‚Äôs read something situation there. links would recommend? equivalent voter fraud. Idk places US like describe since summer..... problem people using avoid vaccine mandates. Ie, already recovered, need vaccine?

Studies like help, uphill battle convincing people. long? rest life? family wear masks around kids forever? wedding first step photos masks on?

At point fold risk move on.  desperate attempt save businesses political donors.  Given vaccine clears eases lot cases long covid, apparently immune system deal covid. ""Process crime"", i.e. worse cheating taxes. least shoot unarmed minority member back. What's big deal? Sorry, completely misunderstood saying, haha. Duly noted. study where?

Israel's study showed something line 7-13x defense natural immunity day at? 


I think good reading ""Adjusted odds ratio"" about. I'm sure fully get think way control factors like age. 


I'm note even sure comment waning immunity entirely correct. lot tests among vaccinated, skewed older. Even number infections increase much overall even vaccination bias older people (who likely get sick something general get tested). 


But yeah, actual study least little easier understand poor wording article. committed felony. Party law order. ...but misses contradictory point unvaccinated less cautious *on average*.

The ""I'm VAXXED"" sentiment combined ""so fuck it, I'm diving social life 110%"" sometimes, sure.

But lot folks combine ""...but I'm still gonna careful."" vaccine imitates natural immunity, i‚Äôm hard time believing offers bigger protection beating virus own. It‚Äôs:

Go count people hospital respiratory illness.  (Obviously people going tested covid, doctors aren‚Äôt dumb.) See many test positive covid.

Then ones tested positive covid, see vaccinated previous positive test (from 3+ months ago), meaning they‚Äôve reinfected.

Perhaps better wording would ‚Äúif you‚Äôre hospital struggling breathe, it‚Äôs 5 times likely covid reinfection covid breakthrough case.‚Äù  doesn‚Äôt mean everyone covid, could also hospitalised asthma flu. Variolation method used deliberately infect controlled amount pox via flesh wound. thing much safer cowpox method developed.

[You 1-2% risk death variolation, compared 20% without meant - someone tell China can‚Äôt go Covid Zero. Science Ignorance. 
Don't fire them. Bar ever firefighters again.
They disgrace departments work for. test every week got positive. symptoms day 5. Glad quarantining protect others. Every death covid death‚Ä¶ per tests banned numbers go nothing! comment referring obviously tongue cheek.

With said, good reason believe some, likely substantial, marginally increased long term protective immunity -- breakthrough case infection acquired immunity + two dose moderna + booster almost certainly substantially less likely two dose moderna. Walgreens let get Moderna Booster got 2 dose Pfizer previously? ""brace normalcy"" funny expression.

I saw Dune...twice...here past 2 weeks nice see lot people going back theatre. mike pence land quiet covid. hes going try rebound president similar mom‚Äôs experience. wishes could get second dose, allow now. China?

They beating back virus putting charade COVID Zero Olympics take place. untenable, isn‚Äôt even real within Chinese borders. Likewise. Today learned toes feet fingers. thought word used halluxes Tourists. thing happening Maine, another highly vaccinated state, lull tourist season started.  like Israel provides great case study this, time, external factors like race, diet, etc etc etc. might get glimpse data Israel. Wish US would actually expand vaccine manufacturing like Europe did. little nickle dime donations cutting it.  parachute gives 10,000 times fall protection single #2 pencil. based drag coefficient. hoever would prefer parachute backpack 10,000 pencils it. remote villages northern india completely wrecked covid. zero infrastructure Himalayan cities.   absolutely incapable reaching, however... know. Take people endangering others, unnecessarily extending pandemic guess.

But point OP‚Äôs post: saying vaccination threshold cannot reached, would wager 80% vaccination rate attained given tribalistic pushback vaccinations.

This answer question: individual society achieve herd immunity endemic virus? effectively blaming broader social faults.

The goal virus never eradicate it‚Äîthat impossible minute left Wuhan. goal always blunt it, minimize impact render like flu. COVID going nowhere, neither we. According CDC, anyone risk 'severe COVID' eligible boosters, 'being overweight' one risk categories. roundabout definition, BMI 25+ 'overweight' therefore makes eligible. offense, think old enough outside danger zone.   took another look docs something jogged memory remembered tables this:

[Pfizer 1/567 placebo + seropositive infected compared 8/17637 vax + seronegative

[Moderna 1/334 placebo + seropositive infected compared 6/14312 vax + seronegative

These small sample sizes, still suggestive IMO. There's probably correlation, nearly simple sounds post. article missing tagline. ""Also get sick get immunized vaccine."" possible vaccine work triggering immune system (same way virus). miss? absolutely HATE whole, ""it never possible stop COVID"" idiots. course possible! like stopped SARS. due lack political early mistakes lost fight. next time pandemic strikes going immediately give sacrifice million herd immunity? imagine ancestors given Smallpox, plague 100 diseases essentially read history books days?

The craziest thing everyone Reddit basically despises Trump DeSantis playbook simultaneously agreeing remove politics. Nobody even trying slow spread point. Might well like Florida attitude let burn whole state they've got lowest case counts country. Vermonter here. Primarily seems governor staked covid end game strategy getting us percent vaccinated threshold carrot remove restrictions, aware delta would significantly change game, doesn‚Äôt feel it‚Äôs worth political capital go back restrictions despite continuing surge. 

While it‚Äôs disappointing unreachable he‚Äôs since delta spike begun, even disappointing see block municipalities instituting mask mandates fall due lack emergency declaration. there‚Äôs bit handcuffing local-level response well, aloofness state  still count 13 that‚Äôs something Believe not, people actually exactly multiple smallpox outbreaks throughout history. 7-day average daily deaths 2. 9 COVID patients hospitalized ICU entire state.

We change way think virus, going away. context, imagine looked statistics attributed flu, quite analogous‚Äîwould shift thinking?

This isn‚Äôt say shouldn‚Äôt cautious exercise safety getting vaccinated/obtaining booster shots needed, say need begin rethinking conceptions virus.  Kinda unrelated - I‚Äôm totally support masks now, never understood hell point masking indoor restaurant was. Even Covid-serious people walk mask on, soon butts hit seat mask comes right like table invisible anti-Covid forcefield. 

It‚Äôs kinda silly feels ‚Äúfor show‚Äù safety. Science: effectively infinite

God: zero There's story headline?   know decent amount acquaintances currently England. 

The jabs clearly wearing off; booster rollout sub par compared wide availability US. 

That Americans authorised jabs kids first, again, blows mind. UK clearly taken decision it‚Äôs ‚Äòsafe‚Äô kids get corona. find approach insane. never another day human history without Covid. get it, hopefully asymptomatically / mildly keep vaccinations throughout life. Using falsified federal documents felony.  need charged. Oh, sure. far smaller numbers. umm, thats works. u still get covid again‚Ä¶ Honestly, people know got boosters recently meet criteria. signed local pharmacy given booster.

Which making want try applying, well - I'm six months underlying condition might apply.  post seems like huge crock misinformation disagree. lots people capitalizing pandemic. people using political gain Republicans Democrats. people using financial gain. people using continue working home things value. realize restrictions changes caused dramatic harm society dealing probably decade. time get back normal. want safe get vaccine. want take risk don't. Beyond that, let's go back normal. things change soon, we're see hyperinflation. We've already cost children 18 months school. We've already lost thousands upon thousands businesses. necessary vaccines. point time move forward rebuild. vaccine working, Covid‚Äôs over.

Even pandemic ends, people still dying COVID.  Kavanaugh Barrett‚Äôs legal philosophy summarized ‚Äúinterpret laws exactly written, strictly‚Äù. pretty consistently, produce unexpected results observers expect take ‚Äúideological conservative‚Äù stance.

This philosophy certainly isn‚Äôt popular want court actively correct errors made legislature make legislative inaction, mean cases would overturn established precedent face really high bar judges. would gotten away meddling ChiComs! Eh, India pretty well terms Covid. seems pretty much ripped population. Doubt rallies change much. Colorado, deaths spiked lot. We‚Äôre around 67% fully vaxxed. Around 70% hospital unvaccinated though, think it‚Äôs mainly getting older people. 

Still sad, still sucks. still didn‚Äôt fully believe reading comment‚Ä¶. I‚Äôm sick false hope stupid speculation. don‚Äôt fucking know what‚Äôll happen. Check article‚Ä¶. 
TL;DR damn idea future holds regarding Covid. 

The basis article non-scientific study done years ago one cold-causing coronaviruses. We‚Äôre comparing covid those. We‚Äôve saying whole pandemic it‚Äôs definitely flu cold either. 

I mean, hope becomes similar cold. That‚Äôd awesome. Please‚Ä¶ become like common cold, covid. Virus hasn‚Äôt listened since day one; still won‚Äôt. still clue it‚Äôll do, headlines get hopes help either. people likely catch without long term effect. 

Without acutely emerging long term effect*  she‚Äôs falling thst sus

wtf indeed Yeah, biggest risk hear vaccines myocarditis... well risk myocarditis higher virus Pfizer/Moderna, risk myocarditis Pfizer/Moderna 274.6 times lower risk death COVID someone 30s‚Äîthat's say COVID's secretly killing bunch 30-39-year-olds (though Delta certainly kills them), saying that's safe vaccines are. as?

I unfortunately think human tendency true people sides debates.

California basically shut 80s Zodiac killer killed 12 people.

For instance, report released Ministry Health Israel, effectiveness 2 doses BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) vaccine preventing COVID-19 infection reported 39% [6], substantially lower trial efficacy 96% [7]. also emerging immunity derived Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine may strong immunity acquired recovery COVID-19 virus [8]. substantial decline immunity mRNA vaccines 6-months post immunization also reported [9]. Even though vaccinations offers protection individuals severe hospitalization death, CDC reported increase 0.01 9% 0 15.1% (between January May 2021) rates hospitalizations deaths, respectively, amongst fully vaccinated [10].

In summary, even efforts made encourage populations get vaccinated done humility respect. Stigmatizing populations harm good.

Once vaccinations got going threat COVID declined rapidly 'utterly terrifying viral pneumonia pandemic' 'bad flu season' couple months now, we've got past outbreak high schools kids immune one way stop infecting quite many grannies we'll get further, 'are seriously telling isolate next week sake sniffle?'

The healthcare system currently faces something comparable major flu outbreak. healthcare system seriously struggles handle major flu outbreak, deeper serious problems country one virus, problems found government. got virus mums works negligence. left permanent lung disease thanks damage, I'm 25 healthy, people seem think getting nothing ""just cold"".

Abstract 
Studies show decreased well-being COVID-19 pandemic, especially healthcare providers Asia. Less known psychological responses working pandemic hospital-based registered nurses (RNs) United States (US). Therefore, purpose paper report well-being U.S.-based hospital RNs working initial acute phase COVID-19 compare well-being among healthcare workers described two global meta-analyses. conducted cross-sectional survey May-June 2020 (N=467). Well-being measured using following tools: Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, Patient Health Questionnaire-2 depressive symptoms, Impact Events Scale-Revised traumatic stress, Insomnia Severity Index. Compared global rates two meta-analyses, US-based RNs reported significantly traumatic stress (54.6% vs. 11.4% 21.5%; p&lt;.001) depressive symptoms (54.6% vs. 31.8% 21.7%; p&lt;.001). Rates insomnia also higher U.S.-based RNs meta-analysis reported insomnia (32.4% vs 27.8%; p&lt;.033). Rates anxiety symptoms among US-based RNs differ reported one meta-analysis (37.3% vs. 34.4%), significantly higher (37.3% vs. 22.1%; p&lt;.001). Hospital-based RNs US exhibited twice rates trauma nearly double rates depressive symptoms shown reports hospital workers globally acute phase COVID-19 pandemic. lasting effects distress unknown warrant ongoing evaluation solutions better support emotional well-being prevent burnout workplace.

Full writeup available here:  Basically, went medical records 201,000 patients admitted hospital ‚ÄúCOVID-19‚Äìlike illness‚Äù (more later) found 89 prior infection no-vaccination 324 prior vaccination. concluded risks greater prior infected (despite outnumbered 3 1 sample) just-vaccinated, 8.7% (prior infected) 5.1% (prior vaccinated). part reasonable many prior vaccinated prior infected sampled population.

However, study lot problems, main one trying draw conclusion subpopulation 413 people deliberated picked 201,000, none data made available, cannot test assumptions made. important stunningly small size population people pulled original 201,000. If, example, 50 people shifted prior infected result would flip.

Lol you, employer issues mandate watch try use religious exemption. article read based US citizens can't even visit Canada without proof vaccination, good luck immigrating without it. Two doses vaccine five times effective prior infection, third dose vaccine boosts 50 one helped elderly know, customers cant help spit talk.

Even isnt effective stopping COVID per se, still greatly appreciate additional separation. Anyone thinking ounce reason would realize whether one ""better"" pretty much irrelevant really, get vaccine.

The worst case outcome someone infection-acquired immunity taking vaccine vaccine induces less robust immune response, resulting exactly level immunity taking vaccine. Odds are, however, improve immunity, immune system mount response vaccine, creating anti-bodies training whatever protein vaccine uses simulate virus.

That activation immune system development response immunity developed improved, vaccine not, giving body additional round practice something far lower risk profile reinfection virus clearly sensible choice, even ultimately might improve immunity. worry, read accept fact.

Many keep bringing children required vaccinated attend school arguing private businesses enforce mandates. mention schools allowed medical religious exemptions.

I'm still waiting Congress local state politicians mandate vaccines staff. far required Federal level.

Anyways, stop coronavirus vaccine? Employers require get flu vaccines keep workplace safe employees healthy. want losers here, already antivax morons. also vaccine mandates require proof vaccination anyone entering Canada. respective populations studied are: (1) double vaccinated people; (2) non-vaccinated people Covid.

Population 1 (double vaccinated people) well known (190M). number people Covid vaccinated well known. 46M infections know many vaccinated. guess one quarter (it's pure guess simplicity's sake) arrive around 12M people second population. So, population 1 roughly 18 times larger population 2.

It's worth noting vaccine efficacy first six months (this study covered January end August) high, effectiveness hospitalisation high (96% efficacy Delta - higher variants, common study period). So, infected people ""five times chance hospitalisation"" still 80% protection hospitalisation. And, remember, number people hospitalised vaccination infection low.  Actually specific reason brown M&amp;Ms. Back day Van Halen touring lighting set much intensive constant issue venues couldn‚Äôt support it. help DLR put brown M&amp;Ms thing inside lighting electronics section concert rider. 

So showed brown M&amp;Ms knew rider read detail wouldn‚Äôt issue. However arrived weren‚Äôt knew venue didn‚Äôt read rider closely likely going issues lights. don‚Äôt think anything would make feel better except trying act normally go home without masks.

Because, cannot this. certainly won‚Äôt able go date long distance bf haven‚Äôt seen person since crap started. Much less go concert next summer. get back society. scared it. keep acting like worse get. Ah thanks info, must 2 confused. Article says this: 
 recent study hamsters found COVID-19 significantly less infectious serious passed-on touching surfaces. Last August, microbiologist Emanuel Goldman reviewed available literature concluded ‚Äúthe chance transmission inanimate surfaces small, instances infected person coughs sneezes surface, someone else touches surface soon cough Coming around error meant could stop sanitizing groceries wiping letters ‚Äî us did, anyway.
 
The linked study, one CITE article, findings support public health guidance focused interventions reduce indoor airborne transmission SARS-CoV-2. efforts include masking, increasing air filtration social distancing, well handwashing **regular surface disinfection**, particularly clinical settings.
 
So hoping people read studies themselves, give cursory glance? missing something?  That's assume Russia honest reporting? I've 2x Moderna...then still got Covid. Wife 2x pfizer, still got covid. Luckily, now. always pro vaccine. Took first day available area. 

However, understand position people already covid. I've heard ways, Natural immunity better I've heard vaccine better. seen studies support either statement.

wgich dutch government ruled increase 6 month period deemed immune (and needing vaccine per se), 12 months maybe longer. effect passed parlement granted kabinet (ruling parties).
this adviced national institute (medical) research, meta institue, gathers sifts international medical data.

Also, uni student ive always surprised seeing assumptions made millions, based 30 people, 70 even.

In cases regarding deciding immunity, research weighs data based 600.000, done know research institute, backed many doctors, seems pretty valid face value. Upon reading too.
There also data bone marrow research, published Nature months ago, seemed point lasting immunity. Maybe even years.

The problem presenting immunity data, great difference immunity 80 year olds compared 60 year olds.

But many discussions age differentiated.

6 months immunity possible 80 /90 plus.
While others expected maybe even 5 years immunity. Ofcourse also excluding 1,1% people never immune/ errors tests.

I kids ""live abject fear"" cold. there's lot hand-wavey hippy dippy shit around ""natural"" immunity bullshit. also studies showing long-term consequences illness previously believed, recently spurred studies around ""long COVID"" observed post-infection cognitive deficits.

What kill necessarily make stronger. Sometimes fucks without real corresponding gain. over, hope carry forward us greater sense agency getting sick *and getting people sick*, less tolerance attitudes like ""lmao cold."" Totally agree. people got vaccinated 6 months ago get benefit more? imagine Danes would say 2-6 weeks ago. since 2 weeks ago amount daily cases increased day, we're likely getting restrictions again. 89%+ American adults qualify booster. Basically people dont work home perfect health. folks could pretty easily find way ‚Äúto qualify‚Äù wanted. It‚Äôs silly way it, net result still virtually everyone readily get one. say problem, pointing something exists, even NE metrics suggest need to. 

The rest comment personal opinion, frankly think incorrect. look data highly vaccinated states (most NE sitting around 70/80% full/half vaccinated respectively), death rate increase rate cases. Vaccines job preventing cases serious, deaths amongst vulnerable (who taking precautions anyways). 

Once 5-12 vaccinated couple weeks, vaccination rate shoot higher, *no excuses* continuing mitigations beyond vaccines, unless vulnerable live someone is. 

What we're right sustainable, societal perspective, political capital perspective. Eventually people STOP caring enough participate (which frankly happening Boston atm, mask compliance toilet even mandate). need look forward towards next step long term management. grew rural Colorado accurate, point defying rational evidence. instance, remember one family refused obey new seatbelt laws 80s. oldest son rolled truck one night, got thrown vehicle died immediately

They still refused wear seatbelts going let government tell do. 

There's defiance there's obstinate good reason. point, distinction somewhat arbitrary. reality continuum droplet sizes, contain virus infectious. term aerosol refers particles specific aerodynamic equivalent diameter take longer settle travel further. understood meant agree completely. 

Before vaccine, willing whatever necessary protect everyone, included.

But I‚Äôm point anyone risk becoming seriously ill dead covid needs take extra precautions themselves. 
Maybe someone 65+ sick limiting exposure without imposing limits everyone. 

That‚Äôs certainly would me. asking restrictions masking makes feel safe. risk personal, risk tolerance risk tolerance family it‚Äôs different. It‚Äôs always way. 
It‚Äôs ok want cautious, don‚Äôt pretend that‚Äôs everyone best interests. I‚Äôm vaccine mandates, thing it‚Äôs going anywhere, advocating masking forever. lot people it‚Äôs going issue that. said US Adults, total population. ever plot nation first place?

To hope goes away like flu. Fiscal quarters calendar quarters?

I've also heard &lt;5 month behind 5-11. Firstly, pretty clear US adults. Secondly, data comes directly makes sense looking total population population 12 eligible yet. look eligible population, we're 78% 1 dose, I'm pretty sure kids 12-17 significant participants US workforce. Either way, point still stands, awarding incompetence solved slow vaccine uptake.  also say intial fallout covid 2020 would much better reaction people took individual health consideration prior? We've noticed healthy nations like Denmark/Sweden etc  many US exported far? Hey, yes got morning. allergic reaction 20 min (not severe. Throat got hot itchy doctor came gave medicine told stay while). feel ok now. I‚Äôm 6 hours in. Really hoping good night No, actual results remotely reflect 99.8% much less 99.994%.

Also idea vaccinate kids it‚Äôs bring transmission, think group risk severe covid. 
So ask again, it‚Äôs ramp society terms masking restrictions ? [Red white think mask mandate unvaccinated problem solution get vaccinated?

I‚Äôm following point. Vaccine levels aren‚Äôt high enough delta variant, maybe less contagious variants . absence high enough levels vaccination, need measures. doctor still isn‚Äôt seeing patients in-person. need make areservation renew passport.

I'm firmly side that's cunning plans. Vaccinating everyone simple straightforward. going test peoples immunity vaccination reserved high risk individuals. young low risk malingers. Yep. 

The thing I've said ton yahoos assuming immunity durable enough (ehhh...) protect people long run, looking 1% 80% US dead. 1%, right?

Only that's 330,000,000 \* 80% = 264,000,000 \* 1% = 2.64m. Woah! Big number!

We went war decade thousands dead. lost thousands lives thousands dead. people shrug 2.64m dead.

But I‚Äôd love come make unvaccinated coworkers get shot. It‚Äôll amusing see hard they‚Äôll fight even cover whole situation happening first place. 

Me, I‚Äôm gonna still enjoy working home since March 2020. Certainly. Abdala, Soberana 02 EpiVacCorona protein-based vaccines millions inocculated far, though latter seem much favourable data backing it.  Stopping transmission achievable goal. That's pretty well understood point amongst medical community. Eradication something going happen, herd immunity achievable variant. 

The best mitigate vaccines, protect vulnerable stringent measures, move on. That's entire point article. Risk statistical element. such; relies aggregate data far applies people groups. would get trouble you‚Äôre fully vaccinated? (I assume user flair are) Headline misleading. 92% ""compared to"" 2 doses, roughly 11x effective 2 doses. words take 1000 people 2 doses infect them, say ?20? end hospital. take 1000 3 dose people infect them, 1 2 end hospital. least read it. Triggered much? first pint agree with, second point way IMHO. 

The cause current outbreak variant makes mitigation strategies like masks distancing FAR less effective. Further, every scientist point agrees herd immunity possible. Based contagious Delta is, could every single person vaccinated herd immunity still happen (it literally lives animals dude, mean come on). 

In general, yes, people vaccinated highly vaccinated areas return life normal, unless vulnerable population. false sense security understand limits vaccines can't do. 

As young(er) healthy(ish) person, I'm concerned, data shows need be. blows mind bad NYC it. like horror zombie movie. images hospital ship haunting gave flashbacks 9/11.   People want to. That's really it. 

They find onerous, intrusive, uncomfortable, want (even places mostly are). 

You argue whether things matter personally, end everyone need make decision societal political continue mandates running LOW. 

People eventually stop it, politicians push beyond point, people vote politicians out. matter time.  Oh wish I'm real deal celiac.  place delivers gluten free food brought tears. fact tasty real bonus me. Personally mind company pay us stick around work parties. Maybe that's free booze food though... even well-vaccinated population still needs mask social distance, virus stops coming outside area.

The way we'll able get ""back normal"" (mask social distance wise, that, death-toll wise), we're successful getting enough people vaccinated stop transmission. We're failing miserably. nothing right vote. Title 7 refers non discrimination voting rights. See below. Furthermore intentional transmission infections disease felony states. fully FDA approved vaccine malpractice OSHA violation require Healthcare workers vaccinated. except think study said Moderna boost immune response much higher Pfizer.  sure been, weather summer DREADFUL NE. constant rain heatwaves kept people inside. fact 4th July weekend (the ptown surge) rained 4 days straight trapping everyone inside. rest summer same

That said, data consistent Delta surge, we're downswing, like country. entire region similar pattern, vaccines done jobs. 

I understand feel like need data, believe perspective conservative end spectrum. Even surgeon general interview weeks ago said need prepare cases continue ""getting past covid mean 'no' cases."" require people wash hands? proven reduce spread illness. one's crying restriction personal freedoms run around dirty hands, it. Masks different, new, politicized. discovered pandemic masks help slow spread Covid, also help slow spread flu respiratory viruses (and plenty data back up).

I know anyone think firefighters losing job anytime soon sounds like they're using sick days. suspended would make sense. I'm fine ""treat like flu **when behaves like flu**"" plan. Sadly, COVID still reached anything close flu-like death levels.

An extremely bad flu year kills 60,000 Americans. That's annualized rate 165 per day (usually contained 5 months, 395 per day flu season - prefer calculation). COVID still killing 1,300 people daily US.

All way back March 2020, Fauci talked acceptable level might be, referenced levels August 2021: 10,000 cases daily US (or 30 cases per million residents). level cases, US's 1.6% CFR, would give 160 deaths per day.

Using values VT's population, need seeing 19 cases per day - result 1 death every 3 4 days average (0.3 deaths per day).

Several weeks back heard even Christian Science encouraging members get vaccinated - church okay medical science, religious exemption claims made Christians largely bullshit. Religious exemptions require paperwork proving three five years uninterrupted tithes ‚Äòten percent net gross income‚Äô ratio.  charged fraud instead. would fired anyways vaccine mandate, course they'll resort committing CRIME. last people follow rules law police, become police to.  terrifying.

Still glad got it, reaction vaccine bad actual COVID would probably kill me. - ""dose"" measured amount mRNA syringe. vaccines remarkably similar, use different lipids thus delivery cells may differential. Additionally, nodded RNA backbone differently, well used differing 5'and 3' UTRs impact RNA stability, thus total protein expression possible.

This, cases matter. actually Boston Globe subscription login? Probably better option suspended. Remember early last year actor 40s (a Canadian) leg amputated died anyway. Imagine going still dying, tortured way. fear virus keep circulating basically unchecked developing world foreseeable future, generating new variants every often contagious, deadly, both. people America think virus stop problem *us* long *we‚Äôre* vaccinated.

Colorado sudden bad? random. people ‚ÄúProCovid‚Äù unwilling follow simple, painless public health protocols limit spread severity infection. 

Also: vaccines humanity‚Äôs greatest achievement medical history (antibiotics sweet too, distant second). anyone think they‚Äôre awesome? Seriously, that‚Äôs like hating electricity, wheel. Good news!  USA way understand statistics.

*The researchers looked data nine states 201,269 hospitalizations COVID-like illness Jan 1 Sep 2, 2021. these, 94,264 molecular testing SARS-CoV-2, 7,348 (7.8%) lab-confirmed COVID-19. Among group, 1,020 hospitalizations among previously infected unvaccinated people, 6,328 cases among fully vaccinated people previously infected.* 
 
*Lab-confirmed COVID-19 found 324 (5.1%) fully vaccinated people 89 (8.7%) unvaccinated, previously infected people.*

Is stating 201,000 suspected hospitalisations Covid, tested 92,000 found 7,300 (8%) actually Covid?

Following this, 1000 (of 7300) prior infection (and vaccination) 6300 (of 7300) fully vaccinated (I've rounded numbers).

So final sentence mean? 324 89 coming from?  That‚Äôs super fucked up. Unfortunately, I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs much Alberta thing rural, small town Canada thing - I‚Äôve always lived city, small town Ontario similar vibes. think joke expense patient, expense claiming Covid ""just like flu"" otherwise diminish seriousness condition many, like poor guy. vaccinated travel 5 days per week two underground/metro lines twice (to work). literally meet hundreds people every day 1/3 vaccinated (yet).

Don‚Äôt spread disinformation excessive deaths meaningful metric? research paper excessive deaths China. conclusion China lot people die covid.

Which one it? Yes , actually. I'm Vermont. 1/3 total deaths occurred since August year. percent positive rate stays steady since August around 3% btw high us since pandemic begun daily numbers continue rise despite vaccinated state. Since small state everyone knows everyone seems time stretches vaccinated people catching virus dying. Governor fantastic beginning following science imposed restrictions mandates refuses even though numbers climbing.. actually read article? Seeing many firefighters (some people trust most) turn anti-vaxxers really depressed possibly anything else pandemic. Honestly, still think it‚Äôs likely vaccinated people take precautions vs unvaccinated.

Thanks vaccinated got booster, never mask attend large gatherings indoors. people know vaccinated same. think vaccinated means want take precautions. Nothing vaccines 100%. 

I think many people expect disregard vaccines learn 100% protection.

In areas, transmission, hospitalization death, vaccines ***reduce*** risk. important remind people convince people get vaccinated, get pandemic sooner. Well guess worth look area, language around *can* get vs. *should* get sometimes confusing. Also, point shortage vaccines, need go ""high risk"" groups. Lots elderly longer drive state ID pain arse get one depending area (spend hours DMV every 4 years). Many undocumented passport home country ID works fine type thing -- employment. easy get ID passport renewal, fairly expensive. surprised. ""It's life..."" said natural immunity trumps vaccine again? point there‚Äôs enough vaccine everyone wants it. would let conscience rest easy say cvs.com get it, dose probably would‚Äôve tossed EOD didn‚Äôt.

Vaccination better it‚Äôs consistent dosage consistent effect doesn‚Äôt require severely ill comparable Good. carrot Selling dildos Pure Romance. good diet effects everyone. healthier takes burden health care industry.  thinking thing also... former Soviet Union suffered TWENTY-FOUR MILLION civilian military deaths WW2. honestly feel average person, reading headline, would never guess anywhere near many Russians died WW2. it‚Äôs sad gf caught bad cold single experience/anecdote. doesn‚Äôt refute mentioned article it‚Äôs nice story. ...and look happened Northeast. High vaccination rates blunted Delta surge severely, STILL places restrictive laws guidelines country driven specifically case count...even though increase cases accompanied similar increase death rate.  mean, things get better, I'll downgrade. long might bring something home immunocompromised sister, I'm gonna stick top line.

...Plus, found half faces drinking tube. point point...and point author doesnt matter all

because government isnt...and wont...work together this. hasnt. countries working these. problem we, societies, traumatized. example: see numbers going vaccinated country panic, even like 22 people uci (and half things like bullet wounds tested positive control swab). 
So approaching issues trauma perspective natural immunity mean *can't* also get vaccinated. like vaccines undo natural immunity! thought good natural immunity came infection unvaccinated, object getting vaccination later (beyond bit grumbling getting shots annoying) even thought vaccine anything extra me. ""But natural immunity!"" worth losing job over.

(I recall hearing month [This Week combo natural immunity plus later vaccination *does* actually gives robust immunity tell. could find episode, source paper would referenced show notes, damned find episode.) Cool, thanks. basically we‚Äôre pretty much dark we‚Äôre suddenly then? Definitely. Every time read article ""3 hour wait ambulance"" means people going hospital have. record go, obviously. know many hospitalized many died.

This certainly happened many Florida's summer Delta deaths. Since testing capped hospital capped several weeks thee number excess deaths unusually different number tested deaths. literally work medical billing full time job. well known fact Russians never put strange chemicals bodies drug testing systems prove it. Ok, anything point actually supports argument moving forward long-term solutions strategies. 

If state governments going fight invasive (in mind) onerous restrictions, maybe receptive realistic long-term view move forward. 

Right two schools thought country. One engages high level mitigation strategies, mandatory testing, mandatory masking, distancing, change business educational modality, etc., another rejects instead wants nothing. 

Like said, cases rise fall long time. need stop hand wringing every time surge, ESPECIALLY surge accompanied surge hospitalizations cases, think going focus mitigating deaths long-term. Cause shields already place paid for. mean, hospitalizations deaths among vaccinated people correlates well number cases vaccinated people. 

Aside that, guess correlates might wanting determine mask mandates would age population, wealth access quality Healthcare? big game hunting again? know that‚Äôs reserves generate almost revenue conservation, right? tons fundraising donation events. kill ur child what?  keep saying thing over, risk personal. sick 75 yo think necessary safety may young person. 
A vaccinated young person it‚Äôs probably going ok even breakthrough infection. 
I don‚Äôt really believe possibility 65 yo sick excuse enough continue imposing restrictions masking everyone else. Old sick people always greater risk infectious diseases never imposed restrictions protect them.

 So, again: Risk personal. posted elsewhere, hear much besides vague estimates Pfizer announces top-line results. Due insider trading laws, information could impact stock prices tightly guarded. happens, hear lots information. isn‚Äôt unrealistic  incentive.


for life saving vaccine thats almost year.


i dont even get 5 days PTO period! let alone go get free shot protects whole family 

its BS F* people  know hospitals troubles, actually ever hit point? I've heard lot talk it, rare examples, seem like actually come pass.  oh know!!!! im saying all. get strategy changes. get ""goalposts move"" get mandates change. im that. 

ive weather virus texas non-texan really showed how....how far ever ""ok"" don‚Äôt have/can‚Äôt get enough people vaccinated US though. Why? need least day rest body accepts vaccine. Anyone article 2-5 trials? might expect done? UK downplaying anything. data best world. government shit ONS UK record keeping not. see situation. Including data available children. may like contradicts want believe. may look (I really think do) read something different others, please try make wrong. Lots viruses less severe kids adults-- including SARS-CoV2. worse kids, like RSV. 

And yes, vaccinate everything viral would ideal. cannot. I'm sorry, getting rhinovirus year end world probably good training immune system long run.

You cannot live life afraid getting sick. mean, can, bad way live.  disagree 6% still high. think might seem ""low"" given context, organized (and loud) anti-vaxx mandate efforts NYPD FDNY members unions. Tbh I'm surprised NYPD's rate. also remember China head start, often wore masks Covid air pollution. wearing masks prevent Covid almost natural them. Yeah article pointless. Maybe strategies keep changing also, situation disease frequently changing? Yep, mine decent too. pay isn‚Äôt great (nonprofit), kept everyone working closed public aside staff whose jobs absolutely required us open couldn‚Äôt transitioned work. folks laid HR kept touch handed emergency loans people whose unemployment took way long process state. welcomed back day reopened (at higher pay due public risk) wanted come.

We got annual raises, flexible work days/hours work home whereever possible, bonuses people working public reopened.

In department there‚Äôs 12 people. 5 us 15 years. time get trouble exempt workplace.   ...and vaccine great job mitigating issues. Cases going surge fall years, vaccines job protecting vast majority people. past time start thinking next step is, continuing freak every time surge cases, despite vaccines mitigating majority serious consequences, long-term strategy.  good way good data half stupid state governments want anyway totally ignoring/actively fighting guidelines based data come federal government. 

i get point article. thats im saying. im saying waste time issue federal state...and smart dangerous isnt going anywhere. building long time. 


greg abbott doesnt care data youre using, collected it, important is


he's gonna keep going TV...jokingly say ""go brandon"" talk virus never happened/isnt happening

then pee-on southern states see texas beacon accomplished fully sell Q/Trump crowd...and adopt policies. 

in light that- pointless article ever plot nation first place? It‚Äôs poor decisions poor messaging beginning. ‚ÄúOverkill underrated‚Äù
-Col. John ‚ÄòHannibal‚Äô Smith  Like that's great, covid measure. Nobody getting covid shopping cart lol

Yeah we‚Äôre lot sure companies it. It‚Äôs places still insist stuff like drives nuts. It'll like miracle. Poof! gone. Bigly gone. went Xmas party gifts were
Moscow mule branded company mugs, sadly people happy that. think clear everyone now:

 - people avoiding vaccination may early cause issues US, now, real problem countries vaccination rates far even US's, countries continue act reservoir new outbreaks. (the answer is: yeah, get vaccinated, everywhere).

 - issue is: people vaccinated going around false sense security, flaunting mask social distance rules. really cause current outbreak. could rely vaccination alone, reach herd-immunity level, we're headed fast enough, need keep taking measures prevent transmission. say member family 5 vaccinated members get infected, resulting one hospitalization, likely inevitable death. Everyone acting like big deal mask anymore. He'd still likely fine.  heard Easter. Im interested vaccine. think it‚Äôs first proteic vaccine, ARNm, viral vector inactivated‚Ä¶ missing protein based one  guess differ don‚Äôt think vaccination high enough. 

We need data. know month so. Cases low northeast it‚Äôs fantastic weather. haven‚Äôt seasonal change behavior people NE typically make fall winter yet. gets colder see improve last winter. Let‚Äôs hope so.

Some data mountain states including Colorado follows pattern south. Money   Thanks added timeline. whatever reason, Pfizer list Press Releases. get vaccinated everything can. I'm triple-vaxxed COVID already. get flu shots annually.

We never live illness-free. cannot possibly expect avoid every little bug. 

Yea, may. what? science lot caveats maybes. what? science works. That's fine. 

This going endemic anyway, may well accept it. bit facetious, guess really far reality. That's sad.  Covid flu.

Covid cold.

Yes, live restrictions forever, time, yet.

Our county still COVID cases per week highest weekly flu count ever hit past ten years. yet.   couple years, Fox sold them.

Sky News Aus Fox though (and similarly trashy). Oh, discouraging. moms Facebook feed keeps telling natural immunity better vaccinated immunity üôÑ hate 07/26/2021: Pfizer Moderna announce that, consultation FDA, they're expanding size trials 5-11 year olds (from 1500 3000   also serves protect odd psych wants spit face able provide whatever feel entitled to. also give time escape start swinging get barrier first. I'm glad live here. I've worked state government (not NY) 20 years. years, we've often experienced budget cuts result freezing vacant positions. time, learned function get work done fewer employees. Sometimes, positions frozen never refilled. job duties distributed among employees simply ""go away"" restructuring. NYC really need 378,000 employees going forward? guess find eventually.   lot incorrect facts post. Pennsylvania 64.9% partially vaccinated/58.9% fully vaccinated among entire population Ontario 77.6%/74.3%, respectively. Alberta 73.6%/67.6%. Ontario better two higher vaccinations maintained restrictions. Covid rampant country is/was US?  unvaccinated stop clogging hospitals deny care regular medical emergencies, leave alone. it‚Äôs like world discovered flu 1% worse flu we‚Äôve always change whole global society reason. yes know differences corona flu, blah blah blah. Yes it‚Äôs different, much.

746,000 Americans died covid-19 last 22 months. works 406,909 deaths per year.

[The CDC estimates average 12,000-52,000 people died annually 2010 2020. Even high end flu deaths, means covid resulted 8 times many deaths flu average year. That's helluva lot different ""1% worse.""

Never mind fact that, again, concerned ""bodily autonomy,"" they're going continue violate people's bodily autonomy requiring get various vaccines every single year order attend public school, serve military, various jobs around country, done decades without complaint people sudden concerned people required get vaccinated.  terrible journalism right here.  want compare, 1918 2021, must remember people much mobility then. Someone get airplane, arrive almost destination, less time takes COVID present symptoms. part we're difficult time containing it.  Forced leave. Bingo. understand comment. police officers often referred ""party""?"
